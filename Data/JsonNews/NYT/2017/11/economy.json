{"Headline": "How Politics and Bad Decisions Starved New York\u2019s Subways", "Date": "2017-11-18", "News": "System FailureDisruptions and delays have roiled the system this year. But the crisis was long in the making, fueled by a litany of errors, a Times investigation shows.Supported byAfter a drumbeat of transit disasters this year, it became impossible to ignore the failures of the New York City subway system.But the problems plaguing the subway did not suddenly sweep over the city like a tornado or a flood. They were years in the making, and they might have been avoided if decision makers had put the interests of train riders and daily operations ahead of flashy projects and financial gimmicks.An examination by The New York Times reveals in stark terms how the needs of the aging, overburdened system have grown while city and state politicians have consistently steered money away from addressing them.Century-old tunnels and track routes are crumbling, but The Times found that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s budget for subway maintenance has barely changed, when adjusted for inflation, from what it was 25 years ago.Signal problems and car equipment failures occur twice as frequently as a decade ago, but hundreds of mechanic positions have been cut because there is not enough money to pay them \u2014 even though the average total compensation for subway managers has grown to well over $200,000 a year.Daily ridership has nearly doubled in the past two decades to 5.7 million, but New York is the only major city in the world with fewer miles of track than it had during World War II. Efforts to add new lines have been hampered by generous agreements with labor unions and private contractors that have inflated construction costs to five times the international average.None of this happened on its own. It was the result of a series of decisions by both Republican and Democratic politicians \u2014 governors from George E. Pataki to Mr. Cuomo and mayors from Rudolph W. Giuliani to Bill de Blasio. Each of them cut the subway\u2019s budget or co-opted it for their own priorities.They stripped a combined $1.5 billion from the M.T.A. by repeatedly diverting tax revenues earmarked for the subways and also by demanding large payments for financial advice, I.T. help and other services that transit leaders say the authority could have done without.They saddled the M.T.A. with debt and engineered a deal with creditors that brought in quick cash but locked the authority into paying $5 billion in interest that it otherwise never would have had to pay.In one particularly egregious example, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration forced the M.T.A. to send $5 million to bail out three state-run ski resorts that were struggling after a warm winter.At the same time, public officials who have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in political contributions from M.T.A. unions and contractors have pressured the authority into signing agreements with labor groups and construction companies that obligated the authority to pay far more than it had planned.Faced with funding shortfalls, the M.T.A. has resorted to borrowing. Nearly 17 percent of its budget now goes to pay down debt \u2014 roughly triple what it paid in 1997.\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely shocking how much of every dollar that goes to the M.T.A. is spent on expenses that have nothing to do with running the subway,\u201d said Seth W. Pinsky, the former head of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201dReporters for The Times reviewed thousands of pages of state and federal documents, including records that had not previously been made public; built databases to compare New York with other cities; and interviewed more than 300 people, including current and former subway leaders, contractors and transit experts.The examination found that the agency tasked with running the subway has been roiled by turnover and changes to its management structure. Dozens of people have cycled through high-level jobs, including many who left to work for contractors who do business with the M.T.A. Byzantine layers of bureaucracy have allowed transit leaders and politicians to avoid responsibility for problems.But the theme that runs through it all is a perennial lack of investment in tracks, trains and signals.But politicians and transit leaders have not acted on a series of chances to turn things around sooner. They ignored decades of warnings from state and city comptrollers. They failed to pass a congestion pricing plan in 2008. They chose not to give mass transit much of the proceeds from large settlements with banks after the financial crisis. They brushed aside the findings of the M.T.A. Transportation Reinvention Commission, a 2014 panel of transit leaders from around the world.And through it all, The Times found, the M.T.A. has used sloppy data collection and accounting games that hide from the public the true causes of the subway\u2019s problems.\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d said David L. Gunn, a former transit system president who helped drag the subways out of the 1970s crisis only to see the system deteriorate again. \u201cI actually lose sleep over it. I get so mad when I see what\u2019s happening.\u201dWhile many politicians have contributed to the decline of the subway over the years, the problems reached a fever pitch under Mr. Cuomo, who as governor appoints the M.T.A. chairman and effectively controls the authority. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is expected to seek a third term next year and is also seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2020, tried to stave off the emergency by committing additional funding to capital construction and getting involved in decisions about how to spend it. But several transit leaders said that the interference backfired, and that the governor would have helped more if he had introduced any legislation to boost funding for core maintenance.In a statement, Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, said the governor was dedicated to improving the M.T.A., including by ensuring a record $8.5 billion in state funding for capital needs.Ms. Lever acknowledged that the subway was in \u201cunacceptable disrepair\u201d but argued that politicians and transit leaders had done their best with limited resources and a flawed agency. She said the problems stemmed from a lack of accountability caused by the city and suburbs having seats on the M.T.A. board, and the city and Legislature having power to veto capital spending.\u201cA camel is a horse designed by committee, and the M.T.A. is a train service run by committee,\u201d Ms. Lever said.On July 17, Ch\u00e9tina Muteba tried to catch a train from Inwood, in Upper Manhattan, to her office in Midtown. Everything that happened next, every seemingly tiny event that turned her commute into a frustrating crawl beneath the city, could be traced to decisions made in Albany and City Hall years before.It was just another day in what had become a maddening summer for the city\u2019s subway riders.Ms. Muteba, a 32-year-old advertising strategist, was thinking about a meeting she was supposed to attend that Monday morning when she saw that her usual entrance to the 207th Street station on the A line was taped off.\u201cThere was just someone who was working there, on the outside, on the street,\u201d Ms. Muteba said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s a block ticket,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what a block ticket means.\u2019 And he said, \u2018You have to transfer.\u2019\u201dNo one told her that a fire, caused by debris on the A line track near 145th Street in Harlem, was slowing whole stretches of the subway.The humidity that day hovered around 70 percent, and the temperature was climbing toward 85 degrees as Ms. Muteba headed to a 1 line stop down 207th Street. Drawing closer, she saw a long line snaking up the stairs to the elevated station. It was moving only incrementally, like an assembly line feeding into a broken factory. She took her place at the end.When she reached the platform, she found that trains that usually arrived every four or five minutes now seemed to be coming 10 minutes apart. She pushed onto one and felt lucky to find a seat. It stopped at Dyckman Street, and she braced herself as an enormous number of people got on.As Ms. Muteba fought to get to work, other commuter dramas were playing out across the system.For years, officials had only partly funded signal repairs and replacements. Much of the subway\u2019s signaling equipment was decades beyond its life span. Just a few months before Ms. Muteba\u2019s ill-fated commute, the M.T.A. had cut signal funding by $500 million to support projects favored by Mr. Cuomo. Internal M.T.A. records show that on the morning of July 17, at least 124 delays were caused by signal issues on the 2, 4, E, F, G, J and M lines.Nearly a decade earlier, a budget crunch had led M.T.A. officials to relax standards for vehicle inspections and overhauls and allow maintenance jobs to go unfilled. At least 24 delays across the city that morning had roots in malfunctioning motors, faulty brakes or broken air-conditioning systems, records show.And the M.T.A. had saved more money by putting off track maintenance not deemed absolutely essential. At least 55 delays stemmed from track problems that morning \u2014 not counting the fire that was slowing Ms. Muteba\u2019s commute.By the time her 1 train left 168th Street, the car was impossibly full. She was not unfamiliar with feeling crowded, having taken the subway since 2011. But now people on the train were packed so tightly that it triggered a flight reflex. It took her until 137th Street to elbow her way out.Standing in the heat on the platform amid a horde of frustrated commuters, she instantly regretted it.Records show that ahead of the 1 trains creeping south that morning, a sick rider was causing problems at 96th Street and a passenger riding between cars was stirring trouble at 72nd.To save money years earlier, the M.T.A. had eliminated its practice of positioning people trained in medical aid at some busy stations. As one train and then another were held up at two of the busiest express stops in the city, waiting for emergency responders, it deepened the anguish for Ms. Muteba \u2014 and for untold thousands of others up the line.Three trains passed her at 137th Street before she found one that she could squeeze onto. By the time she got to her stop, her 30-minute commute had taken nearly two hours. She emerged with a meeting to reschedule and a resolution never to rely on the A train again.Ms. Muteba said she commiserated with fellow riders that morning.\u201cThere was a lot of discussion about, \u2018What are we paying for?\u2019\u201dNew York\u2019s subway system has always struggled to get the money it needs.Decades of cost-cutting and deferred maintenance led to the darkest days in the history of the 113-year-old system: the crisis in the 1970s, when the subway became a symbol of urban decay.Officials rescued the subway with a simple formula: Invest in the system, and it will improve.After more than a decade of spending, about $50 billion in today\u2019s dollars, reliability soared. Cars traveled 10 times farther before breaking down. Riders returned in droves. It was a golden era; New York and its subway seemed to be on the rise together.Then, records show, officials pulled back.It started with New York City\u2019s mayors.While the M.T.A., the sprawling organization that operates the New York subway and bus lines, two commuter railroads and several bridges, is run by the state, the subway is owned by the city. In addition to creating confusion, this dynamic sparks funding battles.Historically, the city has funded about 10 percent of the M.T.A.\u2019s total budget.Mr. Giuliani decided to change that in 1994, when he became the city\u2019s first Republican mayor in two decades. Facing a budget shortfall and eager to show he could run the city without raising taxes, he announced he would cut the city\u2019s contribution to the M.T.A.\u2019s operating and capital budgets by $400 million.Mr. Giuliani defended the reduction by calling the authority bloated and noting that it had a surplus the previous year \u2014 but he did not suggest any reforms to increase efficiency. Critics were outraged. Hundreds protested at public hearings, chanting, \u201cNo more cuts!\u201d At one hearing in Manhattan, attendees waved posters depicting a two-headed mutant with the faces of the mayor and Mr. Pataki, who was proposing his own cuts. \u201cMonster That Ate Mass Transit,\u201d the posters said.\u201cWe\u2019ve spent 10 years clawing our way back,\u201d one M.T.A. official said at the time. \u201cYou\u2019ve only begun to turn the corner. It would be easy to go backward.\u201dThe mayor made the cuts nonetheless.Despite the consternation, the reductions did not immediately cause problems. That paved the way for other city and state politicians to make more cuts.Mr. Giuliani did not return multiple messages seeking comment.His successor, Michael R. Bloomberg, used city funds to help finance bonds for a development project \u2014 the extension of the 7 line to the Hudson Yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan. But he otherwise left subway funding where it was, which effectively cut the city\u2019s contribution by not allowing it to keep up with inflation.A spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, Marc La Vorgna, said the former mayor contributed by fighting vigorously to get the state to adopt a congestion pricing plan that would have provided a huge amount of revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue any mayor in history has made a greater effort to improve the M.T.A.,\u201d he said.Mr. de Blasio has been hands off. He committed $2.5 billion in city funds for the M.T.A.\u2019s capital program, but he rebuffed requests to increase operating subsidies and has declined to provide money for the authority\u2019s plan to address the delays. During town hall meetings, he often quizzes attendees to ensure they know the city does not run the subway.A City Hall spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, said the de Blasio administration \u201chas contributed its fair share year after year.\u201d Ms. Goldstein noted that the city\u2019s police officers patrol subway stations and that its residents provide most of the M.T.A.\u2019s tax revenue. \u201cWhat the City of New York contributes daily is bigger than the budget alone can show,\u201d she said.Still, the budget shows that the city\u2019s contribution to M.T.A. operations has dropped by almost 75 percent.In today\u2019s dollars, the city gave the M.T.A. roughly $1 billion in operating funding in 1990. This year, not counting money for managing some formerly city-run buses, the city gave the system about $250 million.The mayors stuck to the cuts despite a surge in property values that the subways helped create. New York real estate values \u2014 and property tax revenues \u2014 have quintupled since the early 1990s, according to the Independent Budget Office.None of that increased property tax revenue was earmarked for the subways.If the city\u2019s cuts hindered the subway, the state\u2019s actions practically hobbled it.Lawmakers in Albany trimmed funding for subway maintenance throughout the 1990s, records show, even as the state budget grew from $45 billion to $80 billion. Then they kept funding mostly flat for years, despite the surge in ridership.Under Mr. Pataki, the state eliminated subsidies for the M.T.A., opting to make the authority rely entirely on fares, tolls and revenue from taxes and fees earmarked for transit. It also ended state funding for capital work.The move rankled the state comptroller at the time, H. Carl McCall, who warned that taxes and fees were unstable.Mr. Pataki also started a trend of redirecting revenues from taxes. In 1995, he pushed through a state income tax cut and helped pay for it by taking more than $200 million in tax revenues that had been set aside for transit. His three successors followed suit. At least $850 million has been diverted in the past two decades, records show.Richard Ravitch, the former lieutenant governor and M.T.A. chairman who came up with the idea for many of the dedicated taxes as part of his plan to save the subways in the 1980s, said it never occurred to him that the state would redirect the revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing,\u201d Mr. Ravitch said, adding that the diversions were just another in a long list of examples of politicians taking the subway for granted and neglecting to invest in its health.\u201cThis is the lifeblood of the city,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody depends on it. And yet nobody cares about it enough to think more than four years ahead. They only want to think about the next election. Nobody is thinking about the future.\u201dBudget shortfalls have led transit leaders to routinely raise fares to stay afloat. The subway now derives more than 60 percent of its funding from fares, a higher rate than almost any other transit system in North America.Perhaps nothing has hamstrung the M.T.A. more than a maneuver Mr. Pataki introduced in 2000.That year, Bear Stearns, then a Wall Street powerhouse, approached the governor with a proposal to alleviate an M.T.A. budget crunch: If the authority refinanced $12 billion of its debt, the bank said, it could get a huge influx of cash without having to pay for years.Within weeks, a Bear Stearns executive was pitching the idea to skeptical lawmakers in a marathon meeting at the State Capitol.Critics denounced the move, saying it was a \u201cdebt bomb\u201d that would hurt future generations. But the lawmakers eventually signed off, and the M.T.A. agreed to the deal in 2002.The bankers and bond underwriters \u2014 many of whom had ties to Mr. Pataki or had donated to his campaign \u2014 earned an estimated $85 million.Mr. Pataki did not return messages seeking comment.Today, bonds have become the biggest funding source for M.T.A.\u2019s construction needs. The authority has borrowed about $15 billion in the past six years \u2014 about 52 percent of overall capital funding, records show. In the 1980s, only about 30 percent of capital work was financed by debt.The current state budget director, Robert Mujica, who was appointed by Mr. Cuomo, said it was sensible for the M.T.A. to borrow more today because interest rates are much lower than in the 1980s. \u201cUsing debt is a responsible way to invest in assets that are going to last a long time,\u201d he said.Still, most other American transit systems fund their capital work more by government financing than borrowing.Like the budget cuts in the 1990s, the borrowing did not immediately wreak havoc on the subway. But more than two dozen current and former M.T.A. officials said that years of underinvestment caught up to the system by the mid-2000s. Reliability plunged, they said, and it kept plunging even when Gov. David A. Paterson and Mr. Ravitch raised tax rates to benefit the authority.\u201cThey figured that the subway was fixed, and so they stopped thinking about it,\u201d said a former budget director at the M.T.A., Gary G. Caplan. \u201cYou can only stop funding something for so long before it breaks. That\u2019s what happened.\u201dThe subway\u2019s budget has not only been squeezed. It has been milked.Fees demanded by the state for bond advice are a prime example.A bill passed by the Legislature in 1989 included a provision that lets state officials impose a fee on bonds issued by public authorities. The fee was largely intended to compensate the state for helping understaffed authorities navigate the borrowing process. It was to be a small charge, no more than 0.2 percent of the value of bond issuances.\u201cIt was not widely discussed, I can tell you that,\u201d said Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester who served in the Assembly from 1983 to 2010, including as chairman of the authorities committee. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody noticed it at all.\u201dThe charge has quietly grown into a revenue stream for the state. And a lot of the money has been sapped from one authority in particular: the M.T.A.The authority \u2014 a sophisticated operation that contracts with multiple bond experts \u2014 has had to pay $328 million in bond issuance fees over the past 15 years.In some years, it has been charged fees totaling nearly 1 percent of its bond issuances, far more than foreseen under the original law.The Times uncovered the payments by piecing together state and authority records and interviewing current and former M.T.A. officials.Mr. Mujica, the state budget director, defended the payments, saying that his staff meets \u201cperiodically\u201d with the M.T.A. and its bond counsel \u201cto work out the timing of what they\u2019re doing.\u201dHe also said the fees were routinely paid by all authorities.But records show that other agencies have had tens of millions of dollars in bond issuance fees waived, including the Dormitory Authority, which is often used as a vehicle for pork projects pushed by the governor or lawmakers. The M.T.A. has not benefited as often from waivers.Mr. Brodsky called the charges \u201cunsavory\u201d \u2014 especially because state funding cuts forced the M.T.A. to issue the bonds in the first place.\u201cThey\u2019re using the public authority system as a piggy bank,\u201d he said.After questions from a Times reporter, Mr. Mujica said the state would no longer impose bond issuance fees on the M.T.A.This was just one way that officials redirected M.T.A. money that could have gone toward fixing the subway. The remaking of the Fulton Street station in Manhattan was another.Damaged during the Sept. 11 attacks, the station was eligible for federal renovation money when Sheldon Silver took it up as a cause.Mr. Silver, who was then Assembly speaker and one of the state\u2019s most powerful politicians, envisioned not just a subway station in his district but a soaring transit hub, \u201cthe Grand Central of Downtown,\u201d complete with an enormous glass dome and mirrors to filter sunlight into underground passageways.By 2008, the cost had shot past its original $750 million budget, and M.T.A. leaders decided to scale back the project. But Mr. Silver sent a letter threatening to veto the authority\u2019s funding if he did not get what he wanted. The M.T.A. quickly fell in line.In the end, the project cost $1.4 billion \u2014 more than the total annual budget of Chicago\u2019s rapid transit system \u2014 and did nothing to improve the subway\u2019s signals or tracks.Mr. Silver, who stepped down as speaker in 2015 after being charged in a federal corruption case, declined to comment.There have also been costly overhauls at other stations. Bleecker Street in Manhattan got improvements, including a neon light display, at a cost of $135 million \u2014 more than twice the initial estimate. The remodel of the Cortlandt Street station in Manhattan, also destroyed in the 2001 attacks, is still not finished, despite $66 million in spending so far.Last year, Mr. Cuomo pushed the M.T.A. to spend nearly $1 billion on enhanced lighting, signs, countdown clocks and other upgrades at dozens of stations, many of which were not considered most in need of rehabilitation by M.T.A. leaders. The project, called the Enhanced Station Initiative, did not include funding to make all the stations comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.Mr. Cuomo also pressured the authority to spend tens of millions of dollars to study outfitting M.T.A. bridges with lights capable of choreographed display, install wireless internet and phone-charging ports on buses and paint the state logo on new subway cars.Joseph J. Lhota, whom Mr. Cuomo appointed M.T.A. chairman in June, defended the spending.\u201cService and reliability shouldn\u2019t just be while passengers are on the train. It should be while they\u2019re on the platform,\u201d he said, adding that not having phone-charging ports was unacceptable in the 21st century.But Roger Toussaint, who ran the M.T.A.\u2019s main union from 2001 to 2009, said the spending reflected a pattern of focusing on flashy projects over maintenance. \u201cThe spinal cord of the subway system is the ability to move trains \u2014 signals, power and the actual track and infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Toussaint said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been spending money on the spine. They\u2019ve been spending money on the limbs.\u201dThe state has also made the M.T.A. bail out other entities in need of help, including the state-run ski resorts. The $5 million was sent in March last year, after a warm winter in which the Belleayre Ski Center, Gore Mountain and Whiteface Mountain saw a 25 percent decrease in visitors. In 2013, the M.T.A. was made to send $5 million to an affiliate agency, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, to cover the cost of reducing tolls.M.T.A. board members, who learned of the ski-resort bailout from an article in The New York Daily News, hired a law firm to investigate the payments. The firm concluded they probably were legal, according to records shared with The Times, but several members said they were inappropriate nonetheless.\u201cIt would have been far more responsible for the state to have left that money with the M.T.A. I love skiing, but if you want to ski at a state-owned ski resort, buy a lift ticket,\u201d said James E. Vitiello, an appointee of the Dutchess County executive. Mr. Vitiello is among several board members who have complained that the governor has taken a stronger role in the authority and limited their ability to direct policy.During this period of spending, subway performance slid. The percentage of trains arriving at their destinations more than five minutes late \u2014 the M.T.A.\u2019s cutoff for whether a trip is \u201con time\u201d \u2014 has increased in 14 of the past 15 years. \u201cMean distance between failure,\u201d the measure of how frequently trains break down, has worsened almost every year since 2010.The financial crisis in 2008 intensified the problems, in part because of the M.T.A.\u2019s reliance on taxes and fees. Among other issues, revenue from a real estate transfer tax plunged by 75 percent \u2014 leaving the authority scrambling to deal with a $1 billion drop in revenue.The M.T.A. curtailed 40 types of maintenance. Among other moves, it lengthened schedules for routine work on most cars from about every 66 days to every 73, and schedules for comprehensive overhauls from every six years to every seven.Mr. Lhota said the cuts, which have never been restored, were the biggest reason for the rising delays. \u201cThe maintenance intervals were stretched, and they were stretched too far,\u201d he said.Hurricane Sandy struck a few years later. The M.T.A. drew praise for its response, but transit leaders said the storm took resources away from routine maintenance.Mr. Cuomo had steered clear of the M.T.A. during his first years in office, but in his second term he took an intense interest. He placed aides within the organization and, in an unusual move, made some report directly to him. He badgered transit leaders about the construction of the Second Avenue subway on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. And over the objections of some board members, he canceled several M.T.A. capital projects to make room for his own priorities.According to high-ranking current and former M.T.A. officials, the moves interfered with the authority\u2019s plans to address the rising delays.They also bothered the respected former M.T.A. chairman Thomas F. Prendergast, who retired in January. Mr. Prendergast said his retirement was not related to the governor, but several of his former colleagues said it was a factor.Even in the face of the financial crisis and budget shortfalls, the M.T.A. has given concession after concession to its main labor union.Members of the Transport Workers Union got a total of 19 percent in pay raises between 2009 and 2016, compared with 12 percent for the city\u2019s teachers union over the same period.The labor contracts also gave members lifetime spousal health benefits and free rides on the Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road. (They already were allowed to ride the subway for free.)According to a former union president, John Samuelsen, the organization has secured better deals over the past eight years than any other public labor group in New York.\u201cI look back with satisfaction on what, together, we have accomplished,\u201d Mr. Samuelsen said in a September letter announcing that he was becoming the union\u2019s international president.Each of three deals signed from 2009 to 2017 cost more than the M.T.A. anticipated, forcing it to take money from other parts of the budget. The 2014 deal, which cost $525 million, was funded by tapping into a pay-as-you-go account that was intended to pay for capital work, former officials said.Subway workers, including managers and administrative personnel, now make an average of about $155,000 annually in salary, overtime and benefits, according to a Times analysis of data compiled by the federal Department of Transportation. That is far more than in any other American transit system; the average in cities like Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington is less than $100,000 in total compensation annually.The pay for managers alone is even more extraordinary. The nearly 2,500 people who work in New York subway administration make, on average, $240,000 in salary, overtime and benefits. The average elsewhere is less than $115,000.New York is more expensive than most other cities, but not by that much. The latest estimate from the federal Department of Commerce said the region\u2019s cost of living was 22 percent higher than the national average and 10 percent higher than the average for other areas with subways.Mr. Samuelsen rejected the idea that subway workers were overpaid, arguing that it is a dangerous job in which assault is common. \u201cWe earn every penny that we make,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is New York City. This isn\u2019t Mayberry. It costs $700,000 to buy a house in Brooklyn. What do you want us to make? Fifteen dollars an hour?\u201dUnion rules also drive up costs, including by requiring two M.T.A. employees on every train \u2014 one to drive, and one to oversee boarding. Virtually every other subway in the world staffs trains with only one worker; if New York did that, it would save nearly $200 million a year, according to an internal M.T.A. analysis obtained by The Times.Several M.T.A. officials involved in negotiating recent contracts said that there was one reason they accepted the union\u2019s terms: Mr. Cuomo.The governor, who is closely aligned with the union and has received $165,000 in campaign contributions from the labor group, once dispatched a top aide to deliver a message, they said.Pay the union and worry about finding the money later, the aide said, according to two former M.T.A. officials who were in the room.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office said in a statement that the M.T.A. handled its own labor negotiations and that campaign contributions had not influenced any of his actions.The cost of increasing delays can be measured not only in numbers, but also in painful absences on special occasions, lost wages and blown opportunities. Over the summer, The Times asked readers to share their experiences with the subway. More than 1,000 responded, mostly with stories of sorrow.Ashley Patterson, 24, from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, began having anxiety attacks on the subway this summer and now follows a careful routine to keep calm during delays.\u201cI think that that\u2019s something that the M.T.A. should be thinking about,\u201d Ms. Patterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the inconvenience of being late to work. There\u2019s this mental health aspect.\u201dLaura Hernandez, 34, a city employee from Woodside, Queens, missed an appointment to inspect the housing conditions of the clients of a social service agency. \u201cI am a new employee on probation, and it does not look good to arrive over an hour late for an appointment,\u201d Ms. Hernandez said.Juliana S. Karol, 30, from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is a rabbinical student at Hebrew Union College downtown. She was late to a meeting to discuss her senior thesis, ordination and job placement. She was also 38 weeks pregnant.\u201cI actually ended up writing my High Holy Days sermon about the subway,\u201d Ms. Karol said. \u201cAbout the opportunities that the subway crisis gives us to reframe both the gratitude we have when things are going right and how we respond when they are not.\u201dThe entire fifth-grade class at Public School 32 in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, had to cancel a field trip to see a movie \u2014 a reward for completing math exams.\u201cThey had actually gone to the station, and they just ended up waiting forever,\u201d said Dawn Reed, 52, whose son was one of the disappointed students. She said she used the experience to teach him about managing expectations. \u201cIt\u2019s getting progressively worse,\u201d she said of the subway. \u201cAnd delays are a part of life, and it\u2019s difficult to have any sense of consistency.\u201dAriel Leigh Cohen, 26, from Sunnyside, Queens, missed an interview for a job painting scenery for a major Broadway show. It would have paid twice her salary as a salon receptionist and brought her closer to her dream of working in show business.\u201cI was trying to change my life and do what I came to New York to do,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cIt would\u2019ve opened up another world of possibilities. Opportunities like that don\u2019t come around often at all.\u201dAnd then there are stories like Rosalie Osian\u2019s. A chaplain who comforts the terminally ill for Caring Hospice Services, Ms. Osian, 58, got word one Friday that a patient was dying in Brooklyn, and she struck out on a 2 train from 72nd Street in Manhattan.She made it as far as Fulton Street downtown before an announcement told her to switch to the 4 or 5. Problems on that line forced her to switch trains again, and at one point she was left standing on a platform, racked by the need to be with the patient and prepare the family for grief and pending loss. She was late getting there but made it before the patient died.\u201cI\u2019m not the only one,\u201d Ms. Osian said. \u201cThere are people traveling the city all day helping people. There are home health aides and others. And if the subways are delayed, they can\u2019t get to their work.\u201dAlthough riders have bemoaned delays on the subway for years, they often have no idea what is causing them.This is a byproduct of 30 years of transit officials seeking to avoid blame for the system\u2019s problems, The Times found.Every day, officials collect data that could be used to improve the system. For every incident that causes a delay, workers are supposed to log the time, location, duration, cause and department responsible. In theory, the data could be studied to identify patterns in delays and shed light on how they might be fixed.That has not happened.In 1986, the M.T.A.\u2019s inspector general discovered that the delay records were \u201cseriously flawed\u201d \u2014 and shot through with biased reporting, unauthorized adjustments, illegible entries and omissions. In the 1990s, investigators twice concluded that the count was riddled with errors and misrepresentations.John Gaul, then the assistant chief of rapid transit operations, acknowledged at the time that the process was susceptible to fraud because operators were being asked to collect data on their own performances. \u201cIn many cases, undue pressure had been imposed on supervisors in the field to meet on-time performance goals,\u201d he said.Three former high-ranking subway officials told The Times that little had changed since the 1980s. Before final delay reports are issued, M.T.A. departments argue about who should be blamed. Sometimes, the reports reflect more on a department\u2019s arguing ability than on its actual performance.The officials also said that different tactics had been used over the years to avoid culpability.From September 2009 to May 2010, records show, some 530,000 delays \u2014 80 percent of all delays recorded \u2014 were lumped into a category called \u201csupplement schedule.\u201d The officials said that whenever maintenance work in the system caused a scheduling change, virtually all delays were put under this label, regardless of their cause.In recent years, the M.T.A. has stopped using the category.Today, M.T.A. documents say that the most common cause of delays is \u201covercrowding.\u201d More than 111,000 delays were put into that category in the first four months of 2017 alone. That was 37 percent of all delays.New York politicians and transit leaders have seized on the figures to suggest that most of the subway\u2019s problems come down to its popularity.But the M.T.A.\u2019s own records call that into question.In March 2015, records show, more than 153 million trips were recorded, making it one of the busiest months on record. There were 19,000 delays attributed to overcrowding.Last March, two million fewer rides were recorded, but 30,000 delays were said to be caused by overcrowding.Mr. Lhota said that quirks existed in all data and that M.T.A. officials handled the classification consistently. He rejected any suggestion that officials were manipulating numbers to make themselves look better or blame customers for problems. \u201cThe delays are solely the responsibility of the New York City Transit Authority,\u201d he said, referring to the agency that runs the subway.Still, the murkiness of what is truly causing delays only feeds frustration for riders like Ms. Muteba, the advertising strategist whose 30-minute commute became a two-hour odyssey of packed cars and angry riders after a track fire in July.Though the number of passengers on the 1 line swelled temporarily that morning because riders were avoiding the blocked A train, dozens of delays were not attributed to the track fire. They were attributed to overcrowding, records show.\u201cYou\u2019re just kind of like, \u2018It\u2019s a lost cause,\u2019\u201d Ms. Muteba said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like beating a dead horse.\u201dAn earlier version of this article overstated compensation figures for subway workers and managers, based on a Times analysis of federal data. Subway workers, including administrative personnel and managers, make an average of about $155,000 a year in salary, overtime and benefits, not $170,000 (the higher figure includes some labor-related overhead costs). The average figure for managers alone, not including overhead costs, is $240,000 a year, not $280,000 (and not \u201cnearly $300,000,\u201d as the article said in one reference).Agustin Armendariz and Vivian Wang contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Priti Patel\u2019s Resignation Adds to Pressure on Theresa May", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe litany of accusations against Ms. Patel \u2014 who was summoned home from a working visit to Africa \u2014 made the minister\u2019s resignation almost inevitable, turning her slow-motion departure from government into a protracted political pantomime.Television cameras were on hand at Heathrow Airport to catch Ms. Patel\u2019s arrival and her walk to a waiting official ministerial limousine that took her to London and eventually to 10 Downing Street to meet with Mrs. May.That proved to be one of her last such journeys; within a few hours, Ms. Patel issued a letter accepting that her \u201cactions fell below the high standards that are expected of a secretary of state,\u201d and offering a \u201cfulsome apology,\u201d alongside her resignation.Mrs. May accepted the resignation \u2014 rather than firing Ms. Patel \u2014 adding that, because \u201cfurther details have come to light\u201d since a discussion on Monday, it was \u201cright that you have decided to resign.\u201dMrs. May\u2019s office, meanwhile, denied reports in Britain\u2019s Jewish Chronicle that her aides had instructed Ms. Patel not to include one of her meetings on a list of such contacts that she published on Monday, in an effort to close out the gathering crisis.For Mrs. May, the episode has been a particular headache because Ms. Patel is a passionate supporter of Brexit within a cabinet that was constructed carefully to balance views on Europe. Earlier this week, Mrs. May had declared the matter closed after accepting an apology.The Cabinet Office is investigating claims made against two more of Mrs. May\u2019s ministers, including Damian Green, a close ally and friend, and effectively Mrs. May\u2019s deputy.There are big tests to come for a government in such disarray. Later this month the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, will deliver a keenly awaited budget speech that is now fraught with political danger.Mr. Hammond leads the cabinet faction that wants to soften the impact of Brexit, and to protect the economy by negotiating a standstill transition, under which Britain would apply current rules for two years after its departure from the bloc in March 2019.That has exposed him to attacks from hard-line supporters of Brexit, who want a clean break from the European Union, and some right-wing critics want Mrs. May to fire Mr. Hammond for being insufficiently optimistic about Brexit.Such an offer could prove highly controversial within her cabinet, which is divided over the need to soften the impact on the economy of Britain\u2019s departure. Yet failure to offer billions more could mean that European leaders refuse to start talks on a transition after Brexit, and on permanent new trading arrangements.Under the party\u2019s internal rules, it would take 48 Tory lawmakers to force a leadership contest. The events of the last week may have swollen that group of discontented Conservatives.Fortunately for Mrs. May, her critics have yet to unite around a candidate to succeed her.Advertisement"}

And consumers may see their bills increase for the best quality of internet service.\u201dAndrew worked the phones yesterday and hears:Media executives at the other big content and distribution providers privately tell me that they hope AT&T and Time Warner do not find a way to settle. They are confident that the companies will win in court and hope that would put pressure on the Justice Department as it examines future deals.The telecommunications giant and its peers have lobbied hard against the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to prevent broadband providers from charging higher fees to access particular websites or online services like Netflix. Now the F.C.C. under Chairman Ajit Pai is poised to roll those initiatives back.Mr. Pai plans to accompany the repeal of net neutrality with several other measures that will also benefit broadband companies, said the people with knowledge of the matter.

{"Headline": "How Bill de Blasio Overcame the Haters", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "Mayor de Blasio, despite his legion of critics, is striding toward re-election with a bloodless and boring campaign \u2014 just as he planned it.Supported byIt was the night before Thanksgiving last year when Bill de Blasio and Hakeem Jeffries met for a private dinner at Olea, a Mediterranean restaurant in Brooklyn.For Mr. de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, it was a chance to size up the congressman seen by many to be the most threatening challenger to his re-election \u2014 an African-American rising star from Brooklyn, who could cut into the mayor\u2019s base in the black community and his home borough.The meal stretched more than two hours into the night. The men snacked on tapas and bantered about rezoning, policing and the shock election of Donald Trump \u2014 although they never spoke explicitly about the potential for a head-on collision. \u201cIt was beneath the surface,\u201d Mr. Jeffries recalled in an interview, \u201cbut was never put on the table.\u201dWithin weeks, Mr. Jeffries would be elevated to the House Democratic leadership. Mr. de Blasio would call to offer his congratulations. And Mr. Jeffries would forgo running for mayor to stay in Washington for the national fight. \u201cIt became clear to me that New York City was strong enough to survive another four years of Bill de Blasio, whether you like him or not,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said. \u201cIt is not clear to me that the country can survive four years of Donald Trump.\u201dMr. Jeffries was hardly the only politician to take a pass on the 2017 mayor\u2019s race. One by one, all of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s most formidable would-be Democratic rivals \u2014 Mr. Jeffries, Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, and Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president \u2014 would decide against challenging him. The result was a landslide in the primary election this September: Mr. de Blasio thumped his second-tier opposition (led by Sal Albanese, who last held elected office in 1997) by the largest margin of any Democrat in decades.Now the mayor is on the cusp of a decisive re-election, facing a fractured field of G.O.P. and independent challengers in a listless general election that polls have him leading by more than 40 points. The Republican candidate who spent the most money running against Mr. de Blasio grew so dispirited with his chances that he dropped out months ago.In the waning days of the mayor\u2019s race that wasn\u2019t, the question gripping the New York political world is not so much who will win on Nov. 7 but how Mr. de Blasio pulled this off.How has a polarizing politician with so many vocal critics, who seemed in such peril at times, waltzed toward a second term? How did this mayor \u2014 a man who had to fend off dual federal and state investigations into his fund-raising practices, who earned a reputation for arrogance and lateness, who seemed at times more interested in national politics than municipal management, who has fought with the city\u2019s tabloids, who was protested by his own police force and who earned the enmity of the governor of his own party \u2014 so thoroughly scare everyone away?How did Bill de Blasio do it?Almost exactly 1,000 days before Mr. de Blasio won the Democratic nomination for a second term, he stepped into a Brooklyn hospital and knew he had a problem. Two New York police officers had just been killed \u2014 assassinated, really \u2014 at point-blank range. Mr. de Blasio had come, as mayors do, to pay his respects. But as he and his entourage squeezed into the hospital\u2019s corridors, something was off. Many of the men and women in blue standing in solidarity with the fallen were facing the wall, their backs to the mayor in protest.It amounted to a political tinderbox for a rookie mayor whom few had expected to win in 2013, when Mr. de Blasio vaulted past a crowded field in a crazy race marked by Anthony Weiner\u2019s implosion and Christine Quinn\u2019s collapse. In his first year, Mr. de Blasio was facing not only a political crisis but also a genuine security situation months after violence had engulfed Ferguson, Mo.Throughout December of 2014, the mayor and his team huddled deep into the night at Gracie Mansion to come up with a way to defuse the situation. Efforts included enlisting the help of Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, who held mass at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral the morning after the mayor\u2019s hospital visit, and urged calm in \u201ca city tempted by tension and division.\u201d In a symbolic but unscripted moment, Cardinal Dolan emerged from the church arm in arm with the mayor\u2019s wife, Chirlane McCray, who is African-American.In the end, riots did not break out, and Mr. de Blasio\u2019s stewardship through a racially fraught situation solidified his standing among his most important constituency, African-American voters, according to his political advisers.Peter Ragone, a top City Hall adviser in 2014 who has stayed close to the mayor, said the political foundation for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s re-election has always been solid despite the naysayers.\u201cI don\u2019t believe he was ever vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Ragone said flatly.The city\u2019s economy has been humming. Crime has been dwindling. And Mr. de Blasio delivered on two signature first-term promises: universal prekindergarten for 70,000 students and curtailing stop-and-frisk. More affordable housing is being built and those facing eviction will soon be guaranteed city-provided lawyers.Crucially, term limits also made waiting for 2021 \u2014 when there would be no incumbent mayor \u2014 more alluring for officials like Mr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz Jr.\u201cI have been stunned by the level of cognitive dissonance between the reality that political insiders believe and the reality that the rest of the electorate has believed all along,\u201d Mr. Ragone said. \u201cThat somehow going to the gym is more important than universal pre-K, or somehow the fact that he ate a very large messy slice of pizza with a knife and a fork is going to disqualify him in a single voter\u2019s mind.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t so much the pizza that bothered Bradley Tusk as the subpoenas.Mr. Tusk had served as campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and before that as top deputy to Rod R. Blagojevich, the Illinois governor who went to prison for corruption. He likes to say he\u2019s seen good politicians and bad ones: \u201cI know what it\u2019s like under each.\u201dIn Mr. de Blasio, he saw a bad one \u2014 and no one would do more to enlist a challenger to the mayor than Mr. Tusk.\u201cIt seemed to me that we had really lackluster leadership,\u201d he said in an interview.Two months later, Mr. Tusk then took the extraordinary step of announcing a public recruiting drive, financed by his own fortune (he struck gold with early equity in Uber), to find a top-tier Democratic challenger to the mayor. Mr. Tusk dangled a super PAC if the right candidate jumped in.The type of things Mr. Ragone saw as insignificant, Mr. Tusk saw as symbolic of a disengaged executive \u201cwho didn\u2019t seem to care that much about the job.\u201d He chafed as the mayor tried and failed to host a presidential forum in Iowa and rolled out a national agenda that went nowhere.He paid for a poll showing Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Stringer virtually tied \u2014 41 percent to 40 percent. He surveyed other names, too, including Mr. Jeffries, Mr. Diaz Jr., the city\u2019s public advocate Letitia James and even some unlikelier ones, such as the Rev. Al Sharpton and Joe Scarborough, the MSNBC host.Mr. Tusk would meet with just about every possible challenger (only once each, on the advice of his lawyers), including Mr. Jeffries, Mr. Diaz Jr., Mr. Stringer, Ms. Quinn, and Daniel R. Garodnick, a Manhattan city councilman.\u201cI think they all felt they would be a better mayor than de Blasio; I think they all would like the job,\u201d Mr. Tusk said. \u201cBut it came with a cost.\u201dIn his meeting with Mr. Jeffries, Mr. Tusk said their conversation quickly turned to the fact that the New York mayoralty has historically served as more of a career capstone than as a steppingstone. Mr. Jeffries is now only 47. \u201cHakeem \u2014 that kind of threw him for a loop,\u201d Mr. Tusk recalled. \u201cWe both realized at the same time that success for him might not mean success.\u201dMr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz Jr. had the opposite problem: both would have had to risk their current offices to challenge the mayor. Losing meant they\u2019d be out of a job.If Mr. Tusk was the face of the anti-de Blasio effort, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was stoking the same sentiment behind the scenes. The Cuomo-de Blasio relationship had been strained from the start, but it took a turn for the worse in mid-2015 when the mayor ripped the governor in the press. \u201cIf someone disagrees with him openly,\u201d Mr. de Blasio sniped, \u201csome kind of revenge or vendetta follows.\u201dHe was talking about the past. He might as well have been predicting the future.Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, said: \u201cThe governor has been close with Congressman Jeffries since he was an Assembly member on a professional and personal level, and the same goes for his relationship with Borough President Diaz Jr. And neither were ever going to run for mayor.\u201dAccording to Mr. Tusk, Mr. Stringer looked most seriously at the contest.At about that time, Mr. Stringer was sitting on $1.4 million in his campaign account that could have been spent on a mayoral run, just shy of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s $1.6 million.Mr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz Jr. declined requests to comment.But three people who spoke directly with Mr. Stringer during that time said he was explicit about his interest in entering the race on one very speculative condition: He would run for mayor if Mr. de Blasio was indicted on criminal charges.No number proved more daunting and prohibitive for would-be challengers than Mr. de Blasio\u2019s support among black voters, which has hovered around 75 percent, sometimes even higher. Political operatives projected that African-Americans would comprise close to 30 percent of the Democratic primary electorate in 2017 and if the mayor won 75 percent of those votes he\u2019d be nearly halfway toward winning.Put another way, if Mr. de Blasio carried three-quarters of the black vote, a theoretical opponent would need to win a nearly impossible 61 percent of the vote from everyone else to beat him \u2014 a near impossibility against an incumbent, especially one who counted the backing of key labor unions and solid support in the Latino community.The math simply didn\u2019t work unless someone could crack his hold on black voters.That was the great allure of Mr. Jeffries, who had the potential to cut into the mayor\u2019s margins and also appeal to white liberals. \u201cJeffries would have been a much, much, much more problematic candidate for us,\u201d acknowledged an adviser to the mayor. \u201cHe was the one that made people most nervous.\u201dMr. Cuomo spoke regularly with Mr. Jeffries during this period. When asked if Mr. Cuomo had encouraged him to run against Mr. de Blasio, the congressman replied carefully. \u201cThe governor never directly encouraged me to run for any office beyond the one that I hold,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we would often talk about the landscape throughout the city, the state and the nation.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Tusk was dubious about the strength of the mayor\u2019s polling, which dates to the 2013 campaign and Mr. de Blasio\u2019s memorable ad that prominently featured his biracial son\u2019s Afro. \u201cHe\u2019s not Barack Obama,\u201d Mr. Tusk said of the mayor. \u201cThis notion that it\u2019s inviolate is crazy.\u201d\u201cThat was before anyone threw a punch at him,\u201d added Mr. Tusk. But first he needed to find a politician willing to get in the ring \u2014 and he was running out of time.As federal and state prosecutors continued their probes, Mr. de Blasio set out to control what he could: raising money and collecting endorsements.A New York Times analysis of the mayor\u2019s calendar shows more than 240 hours of \u201ccall time\u201d between June 2016 and May 2017, a designation often used for calling donors. That is an average of nearly 40 minutes of call time every day, seven days a week, for the entire year.By January 2017, Mr. de Blasio declared a campaign treasury of $2.2 million \u2014 enough to ward off challengers, his team hoped.The thinking in the mayor\u2019s orbit was simple. Mr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz Jr. were seen as traditional, risk-averse, even conventional foes. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s team just needed to make an open race for mayor in 2021 seem more appealing than challenging the mayor in 2017.To do so, they systematically sought to lock up the support of the city\u2019s most influential unions.\u201cCertainly there is a political benefit at the end of the day for doing the right thing by labor unions,\u201d Mr. Ragone acknowledged.\u201cAny potential candidate who saw the large coalition of support from organized labor that the mayor was building early and fast likely thought twice about jumping into the fray,\u201d said Phil Walzak, a mayoral spokesman.Mr. Jeffries said the shock election of Mr. Trump was more important than any endorsements in sapping the energy for a major squabble between Democrats in 2017. \u201cIn my view, the absence of a serious mayoral race is directly related to the election of Donald Trump as president,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said. \u201cPeriod. Full stop.\u201dOthers point to a different decisive character: Preet Bharara, who was then the U.S. Attorney leading the federal investigation into the de Blasio campaign\u2019s finances.\u201cDid we know there was an investigation?\u201d asked Christine C. Quinn, the former City Council speaker who lost in Mr. de Blasio\u2019s upset victory in 2013. \u201cDid we know there was chatter that people were saying there could be an indictment, there could be an acquittal, et cetera? Well, of course we did. It would be absurd to tell you we did not. And maybe if there had been an indictment, it would have changed people\u2019s calculations. But it\u2019s not like I was sitting around hitting refresh on my computer every three seconds to see what was happening in the courthouse.\u201dMs. Quinn said she never seriously looked at the race. \u201cThere was no kitchen cabinet,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no team assembled. It wasn\u2019t like that.\u201dWhat neither she nor any of the other potential challengers were doing during the 11 months of the probe was building a case for why Mr. de Blasio needed to be tossed from office.In a paradoxical way, the investigations actually helped the mayor: it froze his foes on the sidelines for the most critical months.\u201cThe other individuals who were being mentioned as potential candidates didn\u2019t appear to be developing real messages or plans for a campaign \u2014 they were mostly waiting and seeing,\u201d said Mr. Walzak, adding that de Blasio aides were \u201c100 percent confident\u201d that \u201clegal reviews underway would result in no action.\u201d\u201cBill de Blasio is a man of significant political talent,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said, \u201cbut he has also been particularly fortunate as events have unfolded throughout the duration of his career.\u201dIn recent days, one of the mayor\u2019s biggest donors, Jona S. Rechnitz, testified as a witness in a different corruption case of how he had bought influence in the de Blasio administration. He boasted in vivid detail about asking for favors from City Hall, including calling the mayor\u2019s personal cellphone, although he would struggle with consistency under cross-examination.The episode came seven months too late for Mr. Tusk. He had declared his recruitment efforts dead within hours of prosecutors dropping the case back in March. \u201cWe should therefore expect four more years of Bill de Blasio,\u201d Mr. Tusk said then. That day, his campaign\u2019s Twitter account went silent. He let his website lapse long before votes were cast.That left Nicole Malliotakis, a 36-year-old assemblywoman from Staten Island, as the party\u2019s standard-bearer. Bo Dietl, a retired police detective, tried to run as a Republican but was rebuffed by party officials. He\u2019s now on the ballot as an independent \u2014 diluting the anti-de Blasio vote.\u201cHe\u2019s facing two candidates to his right spending almost as much time elbowing each other as they are going after the mayor,\u201d said Bruce Gyory, a veteran New York lobbyist and political operative.Ms. Malliotakis has struggled to modulate between hard-line conservative policies and more moderate stands that could help her citywide but could endanger her political future on Staten Island or statewide. She sided with the president against football players kneeling during the national anthem. \u201cTrump is right,\u201d she said.At times, the general election has felt like a sideshow. Ms. Malliotakis fractured her foot in an attempt to avoid stepping on her pet Chihuahua. News emerged that the Libertarian candidate once tried to hijack a plane at Kennedy International Airport and demanded to be taken to Antarctica. Mr. Dietl screamed so much at the first debate that his microphone was cut off but not before he offered the mayor, whom he typically derides as \u201cBig Bird,\u201d a compliment on his signature achievement. \u201cThe only good thing he ever did was \u2014 I like that pre-K stuff,\u201d Dietl said.The mayor might fumble some of the easiest elements of political stagecraft, but he ultimately left little substantive opening for his detractors.After four years of uninterrupted economic growth and relative political stability, maybe a challenge was never in the offing \u2014 no matter the decisions of Mr. Jeffries or Mr. Stringer or Mr. Diaz Jr. or anyone else, except perhaps Mr. Bharara.On the Friday after the September primary, Mr. Stringer, who is a virtual lock to run for mayor in 2021, visited Mr. Tusk\u2019s Manhattan offices. Mr. Tusk was still smarting over 2017\u2019s missed opportunities and saw the mayor\u2019s four no-name challengers\u2019 25 percent of the vote as halfway to victory \u2014 a particularly bullish glass-half-full perspective.\u201cYou should have run!\u201d Mr. Tusk recalled shouting at the comptroller as he entered the room. \u201cYou could have won!\u201dMr. Stringer only laughed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Internships Don\u2019t Pay, Some Colleges Will", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the child of a divorced, unemployed mother, Shira Eisenberg learned to get by, she says, \u201con the kindness of strangers.\u201d But even she was surprised when she arrived at the University of Chicago and was told that if she jumped through a few hoops, like going to seminars on how to behave at a job interview, she would be guaranteed a paid internship, financed by the university if no other source of money was available.\u201cWithout the stipend, I would not have been able to afford it,\u201d said Ms. Eisenberg, a sophomore majoring in computer science and minoring in neuroscience.Internships have become a necessary credential in a highly competitive job market \u2014 about half of interns are offered a job by a company where they have interned, according to a 2017 survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.But for those thinking of careers in nonprofits, public service, social services or the arts, paid opportunities are scarce. Employers often can\u2019t afford a stipend, and many students can\u2019t afford to work for free.In response, campuses are using philanthropy and their own funds to subsidize internships at organizations that have a mission of social change or innovation. Students can pursue their passion without worry about how they will pay for food and housing, and for those who see Goldman Sachs in their future, it\u2019s a chance to do good works.\u201cWe don\u2019t want our students to pick a field because it pays and overlook another field because it doesn\u2019t pay for an internship,\u201d said Meredith Daw, executive director of career advancement at the University of Chicago.There are 2,000 placements each year through Chicago\u2019s Jeff Metcalf Internship Program. Employers agree to cover the salary \u2014 at least $11 an hour or the local minimum wage, whichever is higher. But when an organization can\u2019t afford to pay \u2014 40 percent can\u2019t \u2014 the university provides a $4,000 grant for a 10-week stint.Starting last year, the university\u2019s Odyssey Scholars \u2014 low-income students like Ms. Eisenberg \u2014 have been guaranteed a paid internship for their first summer. That, Ms. Daw said, is when they are at the greatest disadvantage compared to their peers with more of the social capital \u2014 like parental connections \u2014 needed to find internships on their own. Last summer, 232 students participated.Ms. Eisenberg interned at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where she developed a machine learning model for its library. The grant helped defray airfare, her summer sublet and other expenses.Pace University posted more than 4,000 internships last year, about 40 percent of them unpaid, and provides grants for many internships in the nonprofit sector.Students in the Wilson internship program receive $16 an hour, or $4,480 for eight weeks. Some 120 students have participated since 2009, with grants totaling about $500,000.Macalester College, too, subsidizes internships involving social missions, like helping integrate tuberculosis services into Georgia\u2019s health system and fighting transgender discrimination. Last year, about 50 interns took part.\u201cThis is an opportunity to try on a career no matter what their interest or major or their economic situation is,\u201d said Mindy Deardurff, dean of career development at the St. Paul campus. \u201cEspecially for our students who have socioeconomic need, if we can get them in and let them try out some of the things they are so passionate about, it might get them over that hump of worrying about whether they can afford it.\u201dAmherst College distributed $1 million this past summer, 40 percent more than it did the previous year, helping 229 students take unpaid internships with nonprofit organizations and small start-ups. The money came from alumni gifts and $200,000 from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which supports low-income college students.Because more than 80 percent of Amherst students go to graduate or professional school, some of the money is used to prepare them by financing research internships, study abroad and independently devised programs, said Emily C. Griffen, director of Amherst\u2019s Loeb Center for Career Exploration and Planning.Michael Loeb, president and chief executive of Loeb Enterprises, is an alumnus who has taken a particular interest in internships. In addition to offering paid stints at his own company, he has just started a program that matches start-ups in New York City with Amherst interns and covers their pay and living expenses.It\u2019s not surprising that alumni favor their alma mater.Over the past five years, alumni and parents have donated $4 million to Colgate University, enabling it to support some 200 students each year who want to take unpaid or low-paid internships, typically with nonprofits, the creative arts or to do research. Last summer, it spent $666,000, said Michael Sciola, associate vice president of institutional advancement and career initiatives. Colgate students can also come up with their own grant proposal, and the university will help them find a host who will turn that into an internship.\u201cWe do allow students to do a self-designed summer,\u201d he said. For example, twin brothers received a grant to pay for travel to work on an archaeological expedition in Alaska.Mr. Sciola concedes that the connection between \u201can immersive experience\u201d and a career might be less obvious than with an internship in the financial industry. That\u2019s why students are more likely to take less career-driven internships in their first and second years, he said, when they are still exploring.\u201cOur overall goal is to empower our students to explore their interests with practical immersive experiences,\u201d he said, \u201cwithout the limitation of financial barriers.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified who spoke about opening student eyes to different economic sectors. It was Rebecca Tekula, executive director of Pace\u2019s Wilson Center for Social Entrepreneurship, not Phyllis Mooney, executive director of career services.Anemona Hartocollis is an education reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

But his future as one of Africa\u2019s longest-serving leaders is now in doubt.Mr. Mugabe was born in 1924 in Kutama, northwest of the capital of Harare in what was then Southern Rhodesia, a self-governing British colony. His father abandoned the family in poverty when he was 10.He was educated by Catholic missionaries and later attended the same university in South Africa as Nelson Mandela.He was heavily influenced as a young man by the leaders of the Indian independence movement, including Gandhi and Nehru. While at the school, from 1950 to 1952, he decided that he wanted to be a politician.After teaching in what was then Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and Ghana, Mr. Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia in 1960.There he joined the movement led by Joshua Nkomo, who was the patriarch of the African nationalist struggle in the country. He became a leader in it, as the National Democratic Party\u2019s publicity secretary, and gave up teaching.At the time, the British government was seeking a path forward in the country, as racial resentment swelled. Mr. Mugabe\u2019s stance in favor of political violence put him at odds with Mr. Nkomo. Mr. Mugabe formed the Zimbabwe African National Union.In 1963, Mr. Mugabe and many of his allies were arrested, and he spent 11 years in prison.As Mr. Mugabe was beginning his long term in prison, Rhodesia\u2019s white minority, which had won power by opposing African nationalism, unilaterally declared independence from Britain.That government refused to let Mr. Mugabe attend the funeral of his only child, who died while he was in prison, which stoked his resentment of the regime. During his years in prison, he organized classes among the inmates and continued to communicate with members of his party who were on the outside.After his time in prison Mr. Mugabe left Rhodesia in 1975 for Mozambique, which had just attained independence, and worked to win the acceptance of the guerrillas from his political party who in 1972 had begun to fight against the Rhodesian ruling party.Eventually becoming the voice of the guerrilla movement, Mr. Mugabe became known on the world stage. In 1976, he was forced back into an alliance with Mr. Nkomo under pressure from African leaders and, after British-brokered peace talks in 1979 that established the independent state of Zimbabwe and set the stage for a national election, Mr. Mugabe returned home from exile.Mr. Mugabe was reluctant to agree to the British pact. But he won a resounding victory in the new country\u2019s election to become prime minister, after taking pains not to alienate the country\u2019s white populace.After taking power, he pledged to oversee a government whose watchwords would be peace and unity. But within the next two years, he dismissed Mr. Nkomo from his cabinet, as his followers began to battle those of his former ally.The uprising came at a high cost, as food shortages increased and the economy declined. Mr. Mugabe faced increased international pressure to step down.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s singular position as one of the longest-reigning heads of the anticolonialist movement made it difficult for international pressure to have a direct impact.Within the country, he clung to power by any means necessary. In disputed elections in 2008, beatings and killing of opposition supporters forced his opponent to withdraw from the race, even after he had outpolled Mr. Mugabe in a presidential vote.Advertisement"}

In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.\u201dThe world\u2019s largest banks have become better capitalized since financial crisis. They have raised more than $1.5 trillion in capital, according to the Financial Stability Board. That provides the banks with \u201cbuffers as much as 10x higher than a decade,\u201d writes S&P Global.But these financial instutions have also gotten much larger since the financial crisis.In the United States, for example, JPMorgan Chase has nearly doubled in size since the end of 2006. Bank of America has increased its asset by more than 50 percent, and Wells Fargo\u2019s assets are up more than 300 percent from their pre-crisis levels, according to S&P Global.Much of those increases are a result of deals struck during the heights of the crisis. JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual; Bank of America acquired CountryWide and Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo purchased Wachovia.Still the size of these banks is noteworthy. The \u2018too big to fail\u2019 distinction has drawn scrutiny from the Trump administration this year. A report from the Treasury Department last month \u201cdiscussed the need to eliminate regulation \u2018that fosters the creation or cements the market position of too-big-to-fail institutions\u2019 in order to prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts.\u201dA surprising percentage of respondents to DataTrek Research\u2019s bitcoin/cryptocurrency survey don\u2019t think so.\u2022 Just 39.4 percent of respondents said they believe bitcoin was in a bubble. \u201cWe were ready to see +70% responses indicating bitcoin\u2019s price is unsustainable. Less than 40% is, well, remarkable,\u201d writes DataTrek\u2019s co-founder Nicholas Colas.\u2022 Slightly more than 27 percent expect bitcoin to rise but at much slower pace. Just 16% think the value of bitcoin will double in the next six months.\u2022 \u201cA sizeable minority of respondents (39 \u2013 40 percent) see bitcoin as a potential analog to physical gold, both as a safe haven and a hedge against mistakes in central bank monetary policy,\u201d Mr. Colas writrs. Nearly 41 percent consider bitcoin a safe haven similar to gold, and 39 percent view bitcoin as a hedge against monetary policy.Would the Republican from Maine end up working to defeat the Senate\u2019s tax overhaul, as she did with attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act?

That\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be a limited down reaction.\u201dAfter the financial crisis, the federal government was expected to aggressively pursue criminal cases against top financiers. Prosecutions were rare, except with obscure, or relatively junior, industry players against whom it was easy to build cases, because prosecutors were under pressure to move quickly and win cases.Philip Baker became one of those targets.He was not a big fish. But the desire to resolve the case swiftly led a powerful United States attorney to insert a transfer-to-Canada clause into an otherwise airtight plea agreement.In 2011, the government allowed Comcast to absorb NBCUniversal in another \u201charmless\u201d vertical merger (a deal that I opposed).

If officials have their way, Tito\u2019s boat will become a museum to display the complex history of Rijeka and serve as a point of pride for the nation.Tito used the yacht, built in 1938 in Genoa, Italy, as his floating residence, Yugoslavia\u2019s embassy and a party boat. He hosted soirees on it for world leaders and Hollywood stars like Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. To some liberal politicians in Croatia, the restored yacht, 380 feet long, would be the perfect symbol of Tito\u2019s ties to the city and the region. But far-right nationalists equate Tito with an oppressive Yugoslavia, which violently disintegrated after his death in 1980 at 87.\u201cIn 25 years of democratic nation states that have risen from the ashes of socialist Yugoslavia,\u201d Mr. Romac declared, \u201cnone of their leaders have come close to matching Tito\u2019s achievements.\u201dCroatia seceded in 1991, and a war of independence morphed into an ethnic bloodletting that engulfed the region for a decade. Croatia emerged from those tumultuous years into the embrace of the European Union, joining the bloc in 2013.In the past 100 years, the city has been part of multiple states \u2014 including the Austrian-Hungarian empire and the Nazi-allied Independent State of Croatia. After the Federal People\u2019s Republic of Yugoslavia was established in 1945, the city was officially made part of Croatia. \u201cI have my life and career ahead of me,\u201d he said. \u201cI want politicians to look for solutions to the problems of the present and leave the past to historians.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the creation of Yugoslavia.

{"Headline": "Uber Me to My Airbnb? For Wheelchair Users, Not So Fast", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisabilityWhenever I hear someone mention Airbnb, I cringe \u2014 on the inside, at least. Not because there\u2019s anything inherently wrong with Airbnb, the home-sharing business that has grown by leaps and bounds in the past few years and has opened up affordable accommodations to millions of people around the world. The problem is, it hasn\u2019t done so for people like me.There are many companies that are part of this new economy, but for the purposes of accessible travel, Airbnb and Uber are the most relevant. And sadly, wheelchair users are largely being left out of it.While Uber has improved its accessibility options in some areas, it still has a long way to go. In January 2016, Uber began its UberWAV program (WAV for wheelchair accessible vehicle) in Toronto. The company was able to offer the vehicles in limited locations by partnering with paratransit agencies, and Uber says its drivers are certified by the Community Transportation Association of America \u201cin safely driving and assisting people with disabilities.\u201d Despite this program, the company has developed something of a reputation for having drivers who fail to respond to calls from wheelchair users, or who drive right past passengers who have wheelchairs or service animals.So where does this leave wheelchair users who want to take advantage of the savings and convenience that the sharing economy offers?Airbnb is also trying to train existing homeowners to be more aware of what accessible really means by working with the California Foundation for Independent Living Centers to help hosts more accurately describe accessibility features at their listings. This is all very promising \u2014 but changes will take considerable time.It\u2019s encouraging that some companies are taking steps in the right direction to accommodate wheelchair travelers, albeit after being pushed. For now, it seems that unless we create our own spaces in the sharing economy, we are doomed to be largely left out of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Takeaways From the Final New York City Mayoral Debate", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe face-off, held under the most politically delicate of circumstances, nonetheless represented the last, best chance for Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican, and Bo Dietl, an independent candidate and former police detective, to directly challenge Mr. de Blasio. They did not let it pass as they hammered the incumbent with accusations of a pay-to-play culture in City Hall and mismanagement of the city overall.Here are 5 takeaways from the debate:At nearly 6-foot-6, Mr. de Blasio naturally towers over his opponents on the debate stage. But he seemed especially tall arriving at the debate hall after more than 24 hours of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the city\u2019s law enforcement leaders in response to the attack on Lower Manhattan. \u201cI just want to start by saying I\u2019m so proud of the people of New York City tonight,\u201d he said at the start, echoing comments he has made in news conferences at Police Headquarters.There are certainly advantages to incumbency. He availed himself of them.In Wednesday\u2019s debate, he stood in between his two rivals but mostly sought to ignore them. He pushed for extra time but avoided extended back-and-forths, seemingly satisfied to say his lines and let them have theirs. It was the controlled posture of an incumbent who has led by wide margins in recent polls.Asked in a lightning round toward the end if he would pledge to speak to the media daily in a second term, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s smiled widely. \u201cOh no, Maurice,\u201d he said to the moderator, Maurice DuBois of WCBS-TV. (Neither of his opponents would take the pledge either.)Both Ms. Malliotakis and Mr. Dietl focused as much as they could, given Mr. DuBois\u2019 galloping pace and tight constraints, on questions of the mayor\u2019s integrity, especially the access that a top donor, Jona S. Rechnitz, had bragged about as a witness in a corruption trial unrelated to the mayor.As Mr. de Blasio downplayed his relationship with Mr. Rechnitz, saying \u201cthousands\u201d have his personal email address \u2014 \u201cit doesn\u2019t suggest anything\u201d \u2014 Mr. Dietl accused the mayor of acting as if New Yorkers were \u201cthat stupid\u201d to think \u201cyou didn\u2019t know this guy\u201d who had donated more than $100,000.\u201cWe need to take the for-sale sign off City Hall,\u201d Ms. Malliotakis said at one point. \u201cHe does enough shaking down of those big donors,\u201d she said at another. It was clearly her planned theme for the evening.In his closing statement, Mr. Dietl went event further. \u201cI know a criminal when I see one,\u201d he declared. \u201cMr. Mayor, you\u2019re a criminal with your corruption and your pay-to-play.\u201dMr. de Blasio tried to repeatedly dismiss the issue as old news. \u201cThis matter has been fully investigated by the federal authorities,\u201d he said. That is true, though not necessarily a compelling argument for a televised debate. Mr. de Blasio also notably rebuffed the moderator\u2019s request to release phone records that would show how often he and Mr. Rechnitz had communicated.Ms. Malliotakis came armed with an array of statistics that she said showed the mayor\u2019s failures: on homeless, on crime, on taxes. She cited the $15 billion increase in the budget. She talked property tax rates. She detailed the cost of housing the homeless in hotels.\u201cThere\u2019s something fishy going on here,\u201d she said of hotels getting paid as much as $4,000 per month per family, saying it is \u201cbusiness\u201d worth as much as $1 billion over the next five years.That line landed well. But others got lost in a blizzard of disagreement and detail. Mr. DuBois repeatedly questioned her on the validity of one citation, the rate of growth of felony sex crime, as Ms. Malliotakis grew frustrated.Ms. Malliotakis successfully used numbers to bolster specific points, but not to paint a broader picture of mismanagement at City Hall, especially as Mr. de Blasio cited a drop in crime, an improving economy and rising graduation rates.The backdrop of so recent an attack on the city made it hard in the early minutes for his rivals to loudly assail the mayor\u2019s record. The three candidates did split on the issue of surveilling Islamic mosques. Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Malliotakis were opposed, while Mr. Dietl was in favor.By then, precious minutes in the hourlong debate had already passed.Mr. Dietl, the sometimes red-faced former detective, was more subdued in this second showdown. But he still rattled off many of the debate\u2019s most memorable lines, even if it wasn\u2019t clear his pithiness would redound to his political advantage.\u201cNo cellphones in the classroom if Bo is mayor!\u201d\u201cFirst of all, I would do a survey on these friggin\u2019 bike lanes,\u201d he said of looking into congestion.Later, of the wealthy, he said he\u2019d consider a \u201ctax on their butts.\u201dAs for how he would improve the integrity of City Hall, Mr. Dietl quipped: \u201cWhat would I do?

Rick Hammond, the Nebraska farmer at the heart of Ted Genoways\u2019s new book, \u201cThis Blessed Earth,\u201d has spent \u201chis whole life just barely keeping the wolves away from the door,\u201d and he knows that the weather and the weeds will always win in the end.Genoways, in addition to his work as a journalist, is also a poet and a biographer of Walt Whitman, but this isn\u2019t a particularly lyrical book. For the most part, it\u2019s a cleareyed and unsentimental look at how farming has become relentlessly optimized by automation, markets and politics; factors that don\u2019t always take into account the guy who\u2019s actually driving the tractor.The book follows a year on Centennial Hill Farm, where Hammond and his family raise commodities including soybeans, corn and cattle. Worry is a central theme. Anxieties operate on at least three levels on Hammond\u2019s farmland: that of the global economy, more local political and financial concerns, and finally, at the deepest, darkest level, anxieties of obligation, self-worth and legacy.Hammond is caught in the massive currents of global markets; his crops are units in an industrial system that can just as well use soybeans from a Brazilian farmer if the numbers make sense. The financial pressures are crushing, and the loans, insurance and mortgages may seem abstract until the bank takes back a piece of land, or a hired hand is laid off.Hammond\u2019s work is also inevitably political. Sometimes those politics are historical, like the Cold War policies that declared, \u201cFood is a weapon,\u201d and that still influence how he makes a living, but they can also be personal: At the seed dealership, Hammond is greeted with, \u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t the local liberal.\u201d Tensions can even get explicitly spiteful, such as when a neighbor, angry about Hammond\u2019s outspoken opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, declines to renew a lease on hundreds of acres of land that are vital to Hammond\u2019s income.But family, as in most stories, is Hammond\u2019s rockiest field. He wonders if his children have suffered for his ambition, if he\u2019ll leave them as much land as he was given, if his way of life has been unsustainable. Talking one night over Pabst Blue Ribbon in an abandoned farmhouse, he\u2019s frank with Genoways: \u201cWas it worth it? I don\u2019t know. That will be for them to decide.\u201dHammond, with his cowboy hat and thousand-yard stare, can feel like an archetype, but Meghan, his daughter, is a more raw personality. Funny and salty, she\u2019s fully aware that farming is a gamble in which the house always wins, but she is still eager to embrace the incredibly complex skills of the modern farmer: arbitrage and market timing, plant genetics and soil chemistry, how to quickly replace an irrigation pivot gearbox in the fading afternoon light.When Genoways moves away from the subject of the Hammonds, he writes with authority on plant breeding, water rights and, in a particularly interesting example, Henry Ford\u2019s early evangelizing for soy as an ingredient for car parts, an initiative that led Fortune to write, \u201cThere is a bushel of soya beans in every Ford car.\u201d Sometimes, though, we end up in the weeds. A long section about irrigation, for example, overwhelms with technical details and historical arcana.Genoways comes from a long line of Nebraskans himself, and late in the book, his father says of a dying prairie town: \u201cMaybe this town has served its purpose, and now it\u2019s time for it to fade into history.\u201d It\u2019s a reminder that the family farm will inevitably pass, just another screen that we\u2019ve used to project our anxieties about modernity and progress. But it\u2019s also an affirmation that those farms have also existed for a purpose: to feed us all.Arlo Crawford is the author of \u201cA Farm Dies Once a Year: A Memoir.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shocking: Trump Makes the Right Choice With Jerome Powell", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPerhaps not surprisingly, President Trump seemed to treat the appointment of a new head of the Federal Reserve \u2014 arguably the most important personnel decision he has faced \u2014 a bit like a season of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d dangling tantalizing hints before handing the rose to Jerome H. Powell.In doing so, Mr. Trump, more surprisingly, picked by far the better suited of his two semipublic finalists.That\u2019s because Mr. Powell, a current member of the Federal Reserve Board, resides firmly in the camp of supporters of the Fed\u2019s policy of maintaining its low interest policy as long as inflation stays muted and wage increases remain stubbornly small.The other candidate \u2014 the economist John B. Taylor, the reported choice of Vice President Mike Pence and other hard-line conservatives \u2014 is openly hawkish, having warned for years that the central bank\u2019s easy money policy was stoking future inflation.Most prominently, in November 2010, Mr. Taylor was among 24 signatories to an open letter to Ben Bernanke, then the chairman, attacking a signature aspect of the Fed\u2019s efforts to stimulate a sluggish economy, its \u201cquantitative easing\u201d program of purchasing debt in the market to keep interest rates low.These purchases \u201crisk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed\u2019s objective of promoting employment,\u201d the group wrote.That was wrong in 2010 and is still wrong today. In the intervening seven years, 16 million jobs have been created. Meanwhile, inflation, which was running just over 1 percent when the letter was written, has barely budged.In a recent study, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis came to a similar conclusion: Had the central bank followed Mr. Taylor\u2019s prescription, the higher interest rates that he advocates would have resulted in 2.5 million more Americans being out of work today \u2014 enough, the Minneapolis bank observed, to fill all 31 National Football League stadiums at the same time.However, neither is Mr. Powell excessively dovish; he has not dissented from any Fed decision since becoming a governor in May 2012, including the four recent interest rate increases.Perhaps the biggest question mark swirling around Mr. Powell is that he is not a trained economist. The short reign of the last Federal Reserve chair to lack a deep background in economics, G. William Miller, was disastrous: In 1979, he was outvoted by his own board when he opposed an interest-rate increase that was, in retrospect, badly needed to combat raging inflation.But Mr. Miller had scant previous experience in Washington or in finance; Mr. Powell, a lawyer and, later, a partner at the investment firm Carlyle Group, has substantial amounts of both, including at the Treasury Department.That distinguishes him from many other Trump picks with their more modest qualifications for their posts.Mr. Powell is also distinctive for having distanced himself just a few months ago from Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to deregulate the financial sector, calling it a \u201cmixed bag\u201d and noting that \u201cthere are some ideas that I would not support.\u201dWhile advocating some regulatory relief, particularly for smaller banks, he has voted in favor of every proposal to tighten bank regulations during his tenure on the Fed.Interestingly, like the president\u2019s own deregulatory proposals, all of Mr. Trump\u2019s five semifinalists were not only well qualified but were also far removed from the anti-bank fervor of the populist wing of the Republican Party.In some ways, the choice of Mr. Powell shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. As a highly leveraged real estate developer, Mr. Trump benefited enormously from low interest rates.While the president\u2019s musings on monetary policy have been characteristically inconsistent and even incoherent, he\u2019s mostly sounded like this: \u201cI do like a low interest rate policy, I must be honest with you,\u201d he said in April.For his part, Mr. Powell has happily made clear his lack of affection for Mr. Taylor\u2019s signature contribution to the monetary policy debate, a mathematical rule for setting interest rates that, if applied, would cause rates to be about two percentage points higher today than they are.\u201cI am unable to think of any critical, complex human activity that could be safely reduced to a simple summary equation,\u201d he said at a New York luncheon in February.Even if economic conditions remain quiescent, the Fed will still face challenges, including how quickly to raise interest rates and, as important, how rapidly to reduce its vast holdings of debt securities.For those and other reasons, I would have preferred that Mr. Trump reappoint the current chairman, Janet Yellen.But at least, for once, Mr. Trump has rejected both traditional Republican conservatives as well as his populist base and made a sensible choice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tax Cut That Lifts the Economy? Opinions Are Split", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the release of an ambitious overhaul of the tax code, House Republicans are moving to fulfill a long-held desire of corporate America: a large and audacious tax cut.Yet economists are divided over whether the plan is likely to revitalize the economy or merely bestow a windfall on the wealthiest investors.Even before President Trump vowed as a candidate to sharpen America\u2019s competitive edge, Republicans led by the House speaker, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, were arguing that large tax cuts would unleash a hurricane of economic activity.\u201cWith this plan, we are making pro-growth reforms, so that yes, America can compete with the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Ryan told reporters Thursday on Capitol Hill. \u201cThis is a very important and special moment for our country, for all Americans.\u201dEconomists are still parsing the details, but even some ardent supporters of the plan say expectations about heady growth and job gains are exaggerated. Interest rates are already at bargain-basement levels, plenty of potential investment capital is sloshing around, and the official jobless rate is at lows not seen in many years. Moreover, the cost of the tax package will inevitably deepen the deficit and lead to spending cuts that are likely to hit low- and middle-income workers.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the stimulative benefit on the economy,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. \u201cMost of the benefits as best I can tell will go to wealthy people. The idea that you\u2019re going to get a huge spur to growth is delusional.\u201dSuch dismissiveness failed to deter fans of the twin pillars of the House bill: lowering the top nominal tax rate on corporations to 20 percent from 35 percent, and changing the way global profits are taxed.\u201cThis will make the United States a better place to invest and a better place to be headquartered in,\u201d said Mihir A. Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School who has at times complained about the White House\u2019s economic claims.Under the current system, multinational corporations have been shopping around the globe for countries with low tax rates where they can locate their profits and sometimes their operations. Those global profits are taxed by the United States, but only after they are booked at home. The result is that companies warehouse trillions of dollars offshore, indefinitely postponing the payment of United States taxes.Tax rates don\u2019t single-handedly drive investment decisions, and even now deductions and tax credits often shove the rate paid by corporations far below the 35 percent maximum. Still, many economists argue that matching or undercutting the top rate in other advanced industrialized countries \u2014 particularly in Western Europe \u2014 should encourage investment and productivity.Slashing the rate to 20 percent is \u201ca pretty dramatic change in the attractiveness of the United States relative to other countries,\u201d said Alan Viard, a tax specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.Companies were noncommittal on how the plan might actually change their tax practices \u2014 like those of Corning, the glass and ceramics manufacturer, which had $3.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents outside the country on March 31. \u201cGiven the complexity of our U.S. taxation system,\u201d a spokesman said Thursday, \u201cthe devil will lie in the details of any new legislation.\u201dA shift to taxing domestic and not foreign profits is aimed at discouraging multinationals from moving headquarters, investments and recorded profits abroad. Most other nations have embraced some version of this approach, known as a territorial system.But economists are split on whether that will reduce or worsen global tax avoidance. The bill proposes a global minimum tax of 10 percent to ensure that companies will have to pay something no matter where they have their headquarters. If they pay a lower rate in a foreign country, they would have to remit the difference to the United States. What could bite even harder is a proposal to tack a 20 percent excise tax on transactions between multinationals and their foreign affiliates to deter them from stripping profits out of the United States tax base.No safeguards are foolproof, supporters concede, but they argue that\u2019s the price of admission. \u201cThe reality is, base-erosion rules will always be messy and imperfect,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cIf you want a territorial system, get over it.\u201dYet if the House plan resolves some longstanding issues with the corporate tax code, it also creates new ones. Congress has, in effect, set aside $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to pay for revisions to the tax code, but to keep the cost of the plan to that limit, the Republican leadership is relying on financing gimmicks to phase in some provisions, or put time limits on others.A proposal that allows companies to immediately deduct business expenses rather than stretching them over a number of years potentially has the most impact on smaller companies that need money to build up or expand their business. Indeed a hefty chunk of the administration\u2019s growth estimates is based on the extra investing it is supposed to cause.But the proposal has a five-year time limit. \u201cIf expensing goes away at the end of 2022, they should not expect any permanent growth effect,\u201d said Mr. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute.For businesses, predictability about the tax code is as important as any specific alteration. And temporary measures that obscure the costs deter long-term investment. New low rates and breaks will not be sustainable over the long term if they do not provide enough money to run the government.\u201cIf they want to claim credit for the growth effect,\u201d Mr. Viard said, \u201cthen they have to claim responsibility for the revenue loss.\u201dAll would-be tax reformers juggle varying goals. They want to entice domestic and foreign companies to invest in the United States, which should, in turn, produce more jobs and stockholder returns.They want to create a system that is widely judged as fair.And they need to collect enough revenue to keep the lights on. That includes having the money to cover Social Security payments, antiterrorism measures and disaster relief, as well as maintaining or upgrading the educational, transportation, technological and other systems that undergird the nation\u2019s overall economic strength.Critics worry that the focus on corporate competitiveness gives other goals short shrift.\u201cThe corporate rate cuts are a windfall immediately for stockholders, and not workers,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. And because 35 percent of United States stocks are foreign-owned, he calculated that $70 billion a year of the tax benefits would go to people in other countries.As economists can attest, American competitiveness can be an elusive concept.\u201cBusiness folks won\u2019t describe it like this, but I think the best way to describe what it means to be more competitive is to describe it in terms of increasing the standard of living of the American people,\u201d said Michael J. Graetz, a professor of tax law at Columbia Law School. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t do that, then why do we care?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a calculation made by Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Mr. Rosenthal said that foreign investors who owned United States stocks would receive $70 billion a year in tax benefits, not $70 billion over all.Tiffany Hsu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Red States Are Passing Up as Blue States Get Billions", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, red states have effectively been subsidizing part of health insurance for blue states.By declining to expand their Medicaid programs as part of the Affordable Care Act, many of those states have passed up tens of billions of federal dollars they could have used to offer health coverage to more poor residents. That means that taxpayers in Texas are helping to fund treatment for patients with opioid addiction in Vermont, while Texans with opioid problems may have no such option.\u201cThey are leaving a lot of money on the table that would cover a lot of people, full stop,\u201d said Chris Sloan, a senior manager at Avalere who helped build the model.Every state is required to provide Medicaid coverage to certain groups: poor children and pregnant women, people with disabilities, and poor older people requiring long-term care. But the Obamacare expansion provides coverage for many poor parents and childless adults who were less often covered in the program. The health law provides federal funding for states to include all residents who earn below or just above the federal poverty line \u2014 the limit is about $16,000 for a single person.In the first three years of the expansion, the federal government paid 100 percent of the tab. But now states need to chip in a small share to cover the expansion population\u2019s medical bills. That share, 5 percent this year, is set to rise to 10 percent in 2020.Some state governments and local think tanks have prepared estimates of the costs and benefits of Medicaid expansion in their region. But the Avalere analysis is the first to apply a consistent methodology across all of the states that have declined to expand. Some of the numbers are big. Florida would get an estimated $26 billion over the next decade, according to Avalere; North Carolina $13 billion.Research has found that the Medicaid expansion does not appear to discourage low-income people from working. More speculative articles have suggested that the influx of federal dollars may help strengthen state economies, though there is little hard evidence of such effects.Governors in expansion states have argued that the money has been particularly helpful in helping residents battle addictions to opioids.Some states are likelier to come out ahead than others. Benjamin Sommers, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who studies Medicaid, said Wisconsin, for example, might actually save money over all if it accepted federal expansion dollars.But legislators and governors in the holdout states have consistently opposed the expansion, citing a range of political, ideological and fiscal concerns. One big issue, experts say, is the expansion\u2019s link to Obamacare, a law that Republicans have vowed to repeal from the beginning. \u201cIt\u2019s made it very hard for them to turn around and embrace one of the only optional parts of it,\u201d said Matt Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, who has closely watched the debate. \u201cThere is ample evidence from the states that have done it that there is substantial benefit.\u201dFor some states, finding 10 percent of the dollars may be a challenge. David Dzielak, the Medicaid director in Mississippi, a state that has not expanded, said raising even a small fraction of the funding would be hard, especially after recent corporate tax cuts. The Avalere numbers suggest that the 6 percent of Medicaid expansion costs that Mississippi would need to pay if it expanded next year would represent less than 1 percent of its 2016 general fund spending.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the money, really, and our state is so poor that we can\u2019t even afford the 10 percent for the expansion,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the bottom line.\u201dBut not every state that has expanded its program has been wealthy, and some of those have been red states. Louisiana, for example, expanded Medicaid last year, providing health coverage to around 430,000 people, despite limited fiscal capacity and state budget challenges. Some of the largest coverage gains have come in poorer states, including West Virginia, Arkansas and Kentucky.Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health policy at George Washington University, said states generally fight to maximize federal funding for their programs. She described Medicaid expansion as a striking counterexample, where political preferences have sometimes outweighed the desire for resources. \u201cIt\u2019s so much revenue,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s when you know we\u2019re not dealing with dollars and cents.\u201d***The Avalere estimates are rough, but they show what would happen if each state\u2019s expansion resulted in a decrease in the uninsured rate among low-income residents that is similar to the average decrease in states that have already expanded their programs. The model then made adjustments for the size of the poor, uninsured population, and the different costs of providing Medicaid care in different states. Most of the states that haven\u2019t expanded are likely to reap more federal dollars than these estimates if they expand, said Mr. Sloan, but analysts felt the average number was a useful, conservative estimate. (That means that our figures may also understate the amount of money that states would need to spend, too.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shoppers Hit the Mall, but More Often Tapped Their Phones", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byE-commerce\u2019s unrelenting march toward domination of the retail industry accelerated during the Thanksgiving holiday, as Americans spent billions more shopping online than they did last year.Crowds still flocked to stores to scoop up deals on televisions, toys and clothing. But the big driver of America\u2019s five-day shopping spree that starts on Thanksgiving was the mobile phone, not the mall.Americans spent $19.62 billion shopping online over the five days, about $2.6 billion more than they spent during the same period last year, according to Adobe Analytics, which has tracked online shopping for years. .While the shift away from stores has been happening for years, the evolution continues to accelerate. About 81 million people shopped online on Monday, a day of big internet sales known as Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation.Brick-and-mortar retailers were aided over the five days by good weather across much of the country and strength in the economy, including low unemployment and a rising stock market.The federation said an estimated 174 million people went shopping over the Thanksgiving holiday, about 10 million more than it had forecast. The trade group said Tuesday that the shopping data reaffirmed its earlier prediction that total sales this holiday season would increase by as much as 4 percent over last year.\u201cWe are certainly encouraged that we are starting off from a period of strength,\u201d Matthew Shay, the president of the National Retail Federation, said in a call with reporters. \u201cIt bodes well for the rest of the year.\u201dOlder millennials (ages 25 to 34) were the biggest spenders, with an average output of $419.52, the federation said.The retail federation said about 58 million consumers shopped online only, while 51 million shopped only in stores. Roughly 64 million shopped in both stores and online.Because the federation changed the way it analyzed holiday shopping data this year, the group was unable to say how shopping in stores compared with last year. It was also unable to provide the amount of total sales generated, saying that it would be difficult to extrapolate a figure from its sampling of consumers.The gap in the trade group\u2019s data only seemed to accentuate the strength of this year\u2019s online sales, which totaled $6.59 billion on Cyber Monday alone, according to Adobe.Analysis from other research firms showed traffic to stores falling over the holiday, though the decline was not as steep as some predicted.\u201cIt may not have been as bad as feared for brick-and-mortar stores,\u201d said Joel Bines, a managing director focused on retail at AlixPartners, an advisory firm. \u201cBut there is no question that physical shopping is losing to online shopping.\u201dThe kickoff to the holiday shopping season is a now a five-day affair of discounts and perks \u2014 and nicknames, stretching through Black Friday into Small Business Saturday and finishing on Cyber Monday. Black Friday was second to Cyber Monday for online shoppers, with 66 million, according to the retail federation.\u201cThere is money moving from one day to another,\u201d said Tamara Gaffney, strategic insights engagement group director at Adobe.The top-selling items on Cyber Monday, according to Adobe, included the Nintendo Switch game system and Hatchimals Colleggtibles figurines, which are popular again this year with children.Televisions were the most discounted items, with markdowns averaging about 20 percent.And nearly a third of Cyber Monday purchases were made on a mobile device, according to Adobe.Brick-and-mortar retailers entered the Thanksgiving under a cloud of gloom. But after suffering big drops in store traffic on Black Friday in previous years, this year\u2019s decline was slight.Store traffic fell 1.6 percent from last year, according to ShopperTrak, an analytics firm, with many big retailers offering deals starting on Thanksgiving.\u201cBlack Friday itself is not dead yet, but it is not what it used to be,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail research and consulting firm.The top shopping destination were department stores, according to the National Retail Federation, while the most popular gifts purchased included clothing and toys.The checks are used to approximate gun sales, although the number, reported by the F.B.I.\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, almost certainly understates the actual total. Transactions between private parties do not require background checks, and customers who have been cleared can buy multiple weapons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Hit With New Blow in London as Panel Says Drivers Aren\u2019t Self-Employed", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Uber suffered another setback in its biggest market outside the United States after a British employment tribunal rejected the ride-hailing company\u2019s argument that its drivers are self-employed.Companies argue that such labor practices increase flexibility on both sides of the hiring equation. But critics counter that the system is exploitative and deprives employees of important safeguards like unemployment insurance.In the case before the employment tribunal, two men, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, had challenged Uber on behalf of a group of 19 drivers, saying that the service had denied them basic protections by classifying them as self-employed. Uber countered with an argument it has used around the world: Its drivers were independent contractors.\u201cYou can hide behind technology, but the laws are there, and they need to be obeyed and respected,\u201d Mr. Aslam, 36, said in an interview after the tribunal issued its decision. \u201cThe impact of this ruling could affect thousands of drivers, and not just drivers but millions of workers across the U.K.\u201d\u201cIt just means we can\u2019t be exploited,\u201d he added.The acting chief of Uber\u2019s British operations, Tom Elvidge, said the company would appeal the decision, either to the Court of Appeal or to Britain\u2019s Supreme Court.Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s shift in tone comes at a crucial time. Uber is aiming for an initial public offering in 2019, and working on securing a multibillion-dollar investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.As part of its push to win over customers and drivers concerned about Uber\u2019s reputation, the company has introduced new measures and services, including allowing users to add tips to fares. Uber has also promoted its efforts, particularly in Britain, to provide drivers with benefits like access to insurance and pensions.\u201cEssentially, it has been outrunning employment law and legislators,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Spicer, a professor at City University\u2019s Cass Business School in London. \u201cIt\u2019s having to become more like a normal company, rather than one that was able to evade existing legal frameworks.\u201dUber\u2019s operations in London are crucial to its global expansion. The company started operating in the city in 2012, and now offers its services in dozens of cities nationwide. About 40,000 people drive for Uber in the British capital, and the company says that three million customers have used the app in London at least once in the past three months.Labor experts say that laws in most countries have failed to keep pace with advances in technology and the rise of the gig economy. In Britain, for example, the main piece of legislation that regulates how workers are treated was passed in 1996.\u201cThe legislation is old,\u201d said Susannah Kintish, a partner at the law firm Mishcon de Reya who specializes in employment law. \u201cIt came out when the Spice Girls had their first hit.

{"Headline": "Who Is Jerome Powell: Trump\u2019s Pick for Fed Chairman", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne thing he\u2019s missing: He would be the first Fed chief in more than four decades who did not have an economics degree.Mr. Powell, 64, was born in Washington, the son of a lawyer, and studied politics at Princeton University. He earned a law degree from Georgetown University, where he was editor in chief of the Georgetown Law Journal.After working a few years as a lawyer, he embarked in 1984 on a career in investment banking, starting at Dillon, Read and Company in New York.In 1990, during first President George Bush\u2019s term, he moved back to Washington to become the Treasury Department\u2019s under secretary for finance. The Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, had been chairman of Dillon Read. Mr. Powell was responsible for policy on financial institutions and the Treasury debt market.Mr. Powell, a Republican, is a centrist voice in the Fed\u2019s internal debates, often raising his concerns in private conversation rather than in public speeches. He has voted for every policy decision since joining the Fed, including four interest rate increases, and supported the Fed\u2019s decision to unwind the bond-buying program put in place during and after the 2008 financial crisis.In September 2012, when Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman at the time, announced a third round of bond buying as part of that program, Mr. Powell pressed for a clarification of the Fed\u2019s goals, establishing what Mr. Powell called an \u201cofframp\u201d for the program.\u201cIf the economy performs about as expected, I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates,\u201d Mr. Powell said.A survey of 144 investors conducted by Evercore ISI found investors expected that Mr. Powell would push rates modestly higher over time than Ms. Yellen would.\u201cThe whole idea is to preserve the significant core reforms that were made but to go back and clean up our work,\u201d Mr. Powell said.\u201cI see it is a mixed bag,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness.\u201dMr. Powell has shown a willingness to reach across the aisle to seek solutions to problems.

{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo the Editor:Martin Amis walks on thin ice when he asserts, in \u201cThe Deadliest Idealism\u201d (Oct. 22), that Marxism\u2019s fatal flaw was \u201cits point-by-point defiance of human nature.\u201d (As a general caveat, I would point out that descriptions of that very slippery beast, human nature, generally tend to be apologies for a given status quo. It has to be this way because of human nature!) Implicit in Amis\u2019s assertion is the assumption that capitalism works because it conforms to human nature. However, many have pointed out that Homo economicus \u2014 that instinctively self-interested, bartering, trading linchpin of economic theory \u2014 is little more than an abstraction. There is scant evidence for the existence of this subspecies of the genus Homo in the anthropological and historic record.While l agree with Amis that the Marxist project was fatally, monstrously flawed, we need to remind ourselves (while avoiding the pitfall of \u201cmoral equivalence\u201d) that capitalist political economy is also a project rather than a natural development. \u201cTotalitarian\u201d is the wrong word for the capitalist project because totalitarianism is a disease of governments. \u201cTotalizing\u201d is a more precise description. In capitalism\u2019s colonization of every aspect of our lives \u2014 work, leisure, worldview \u2014 it too makes a \u201ctotal claim\u201d on its subjects.To the Editor:Reading James Ryerson\u2019s reviews of three books on the meaning of religion (Ivory Tower, Oct. 22), I was surprised by the absence of any discussion of the preservation of hegemony. Aside from the various paradigmatic explanations (Tim Crane\u2019s need to create the transcendent, Christian Smith\u2019s need to provide a source of superior hope or John F. Haught\u2019s hope for \u201cinterior striving\u201d), many religions are imbued with a notion of ordering in which certain adherents are granted superior powers or status. Within the Roman Catholic Church, only men are allowed access to the priesthood. Within Islam, men are granted favored treatment when inheriting. The list goes on. In virtually every case, structural hegemony is systemic. And in every case, the power structure is justified by pointing to interpretations of holy texts by \u2014 guess who? \u2014 the very people who have been granted the superior status. Talk about stacking the deck!Advertisement"}

They have said that Mr. Kim appeared to be using his tactic of instilling fear in the elites in order to strengthen his control as the country braced for the pain that is likely to result from recently imposed United Nations sanctions.During a closed-door parliamentary briefing on Monday, South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers that the North\u2019s General Political Bureau was being \u201caudited\u201d by the country\u2019s leadership for the first time in 20 years. The military organization\u2019s director, Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong-so, and his deputies were \u201cpunished,\u201d according to lawmakers who briefed reporters after the session.The General Political Bureau oversees the political life of North Korea\u2019s 1.1-million-strong People\u2019s Army, monitoring the loyalty of its officers. Vice Marshal Hwang has been widely considered the No. 2 man in Mr. Kim\u2019s totalitarian regime.The intelligence agency did not reveal how it obtained its information. But it did not use the phrases \u201cpurge\u201d or \u201cexecution,\u201d indicating that Vice Marshal Hwang was reprimanded but may still hold his job. He has not been seen in public since Oct. 13, according to the South Korean news media, which monitors the North\u2019s state-run outlets.South Korean intelligence officials said that the General Political Bureau was being audited for \u201cimpure attitude\u201d and that the move was spearheaded by Choe Ryong-hae, a top official of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party who gained more influence during a party meeting in early October. Intelligence officials in the South now believe that Mr. Choe is the head of the Department of Organization and Guidance, the party\u2019s most powerful agency, which Mr. Kim uses to control the country\u2019s political and military elite.In recent months, however, North Korea observers have begun noticing a shift.When North Korean state media announced a recent leadership roster in October, Vice Marshal Hwang\u2019s name had fallen behind those of Mr. Choe and Premier Pak Pong-ju, who is in charge of the economy.Like Mr. Pak, Mr. Choe was considered more of a pragmatic administrator than Vice Marshal Hwang, who has accompanied Mr. Kim far more frequently than Mr. Choe when the top leader inspected a recent series weapons tests.North Korea has not conducted any missile tests since Sept. 15, raising cautious hopes in the region that it might be moving to ease tensions and open talks with Washington.One factor in the recent disciplinary action, an analyst said, is that Mr. Kim often pits his top lieutenants against one another to keep them in check and ensure their loyalty. Mr. Choe\u2019s rise at the expense of Vice Marshal Hwang was also seen as reflecting Mr. Kim\u2019s attempt to use the party to curb the influence of the military, which had eclipsed the party in influence under his father\u2019s rule.Advertisement"}

I called my thrilled parents and celebrated with friends. I\u2019m from northeastern China and have an M.B.A. from Stanford, and was planning to stay in Silicon Valley to help start a company based on a promising new technology to improve the use of data. I was overjoyed because, historically, being selected in the lottery was a near guarantee that an applicant could remain in this country at least three more years.But at the end of July, I received the dreaded Request for Further Evidence from immigration authorities. I provided the extra information that United States Citizenship and Immigration Services asked for. In September, I got another request. I complied again. Finally, on Oct. 11, half a year after my celebration, I learned I had been denied a visa.After earning law degrees in China and at Oxford, after having worked in Hong Kong as a lawyer at a top international firm, after coming to United States three years ago for an M.B.A. and graduating and joining a start-up, I was given just 60 days to leave the country. I have 17 days left.Many of my fellow international students are in situations similar to mine. Some had job offers from companies like Google, Apple and PwC when they learned that their applications had been denied or did not even make it into the lottery. For those whose employers have only United States offices, losing the lottery meant losing jobs and going home, with no real way to use the skills they were on the verge of contributing to the American economy.My two requests for evidence asked me to prove my job was a \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d \u2014 that is, work that only someone with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher can do. My work involves artificial intelligence and big data, and my letters of support came from an authority in my industry and veteran start-up investor, and a Nobel Prize winner. But it wasn\u2019t enough to convince the government that my job requires advanced skills.It\u2019s true that I\u2019m brokenhearted about missing the chance to return to China to care for my mother (she insisted that I stay and pursue the visa that was her dream for me), but I\u2019m not looking for sympathy. As much as I hate to leave, I know I will be fine.Rather, I\u2019m frustrated, because I know I\u2019m part of a pattern: America is losing many very skilled workers because of its anti-immigrant sentiment, and while this is a disappointing blow to me and my classmates, it will also be a blow to the United States\u2019 competitiveness in the global economy. Tech giants such as Google and Tesla were founded by immigrants.I can\u2019t make sense of why an administration that claims to want this country to be strong would be so eager to get rid of us. We are losing our dreams, and America is losing the value we bring.As I make plans to go back to China, I find myself wondering: If I am not qualified to stay in the United States, then who is?Frida Yu is a lawyer and entrepreneur.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Effort to Tame Its Financial System May Disappoint", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the details may raise more questions than they answer, and could disappoint those looking for a strong hand to rein in the financial system underpinning the world\u2019s second-largest economy.Official Chinese media reported late Wednesday that a new Financial Stability and Development Committee had held its first meeting, nearly four months after President Xi Jinping ordered its creation. It said the meeting was led by Ma Kai, a 71-year-old vice premier.At the meeting, Mr. Ma stressed that China\u2019s financial system should serve the real economy, according to the official Xinhua news agency \u2014 namely, making money available to businesses that need it. He also stressed financial security, the report said.But the commission that emerged seemed more a minnow than a whale. None of the current agencies disappeared, and the commission was merely assigned a small office in a corner of the central bank.Mr. Ma himself is something of a lame duck, being past the age when Chinese officials typically retire. While he remains a vice premier in the Chinese government, he lost his seats on senior decision-making bodies within the Chinese Communist Party amid a broad reshuffle last month.Still, the committee could be strengthened later, or more details may emerge that further outline its powers.The decision to hold the committee as President Trump arrived in Beijing for a meeting with Mr. Xi may be an indication that the Chinese leadership is still focused on the country\u2019s financial vulnerabilities, even if a long-term leader to address those vulnerabilities has not yet been chosen.Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the country\u2019s central bank for the past 15 years, and who is also expected to retire this winter, has been issuing increasingly dire warnings in recent weeks about the country\u2019s mountain of debt, particularly at state-owned enterprises and local governments.\u201cIn recent years, nonperforming loans have risen, eroding banking capital and risk resilience,\u201d Mr. Zhou warned in a statement released Saturday. The statement went on to warn about rising bond defaults as well as Ponzi schemes masquerading as internet finance companies.Having a vice premier run the first meeting nonetheless raises the profile of the commission. It could establish a precedent that the commission may continue to be run by a vice premier. Vice premiers are at least two rungs more senior in the Chinese system than the minister-level officials who run the central bank and the financial regulatory agencies.Its next leader might also be considerably more influential and politically connected. Some experts suggest that Liu He, a close economic adviser to Mr. Xi, may emerge as the successor to Mr. Ma as the vice premier with responsibility over wide areas of the economy, including financial regulation.Mr. Liu has a reputation for advocating a greater reliance on market forces in economic reform policies. By contrast, Mr. Xi has taken a greater interest in strengthening the role of the Communist Party in most aspects of life in China, including the financial sector.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Norway\u2019s Wealth Fund Considers Divesting From Oil Shares", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNorway\u2019s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund is considering a divestment of holdings in international petroleum companies, a sign that even Europe\u2019s dominant producer does not have full confidence in oil\u2019s future.The recommendation on Thursday by the Norwegian Central Bank, which manages the fund, is potentially the biggest advance yet for a global fossil-fuel divestment campaign that has been promoted on college campuses and by environmental activists.It could also be a setback for the proposed initial public offering of the Saudi national oil company, known as Aramco, since the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, the world\u2019s largest, would be a potentially large investor. The public offering depends on high oil prices, while the move by the Norwegian bank suggested uncertainty about the future demand for oil.\u201cIt\u2019s very significant symbolically because it sends a signal that even the people who make money from oil and gas are coming up with divestment plans,\u201d said Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cThe Norwegian view is that oil has had a good run and will have a good run for a couple of decades but it\u2019s not the only future that is out there.\u201dWith roughly $35 billion invested in oil companies, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is a large investor in Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, Chevron and Norway\u2019s own oil giant, Statoil. Statoil has begun to diversify its holdings by building large offshore wind-energy projects.Although it is Europe\u2019s top oil producer, Norway is also a leader in the movement to control climate change. With hefty incentives, roughly 40 percent of cars bought in Norway last year were electric, and the government plans to phase out diesel- and gasoline-fueled cars in the next decade.The potential Norwegian divestment of oil is not expected to happen until late 2018 at the soonest.But on a day when oil prices were down moderately and most global stock markets soared, shares of several large oil companies were down by up to 1 percent.\u201cIt sends a signal that others could follow, and if this becomes a growing movement it could have a material impact,\u201d said Brian M. Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones Investments. \u201cIt shows the global environmental movement continues to gain steam.\u201dEnvironmentalists praised the potential divestment as historically important.\u201cWith Norway\u2019s move, the campaign to divest from dirty fuels will graduate from environmental groups and small businesses like Ben & Jerry\u2019s and colleges to the big time,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, based in Washington. \u201cNorway\u2019s move will fuel divestment even more because Norway is a major oil country.\u201dReligious institutions, pension funds and other financial institutions in more than 70 countries controlling more than $5 trillion in assets have already committed to dropping some of their fossil-fuel holdings in recent years. The movement gained a major push from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Another movement by investors has pressured European and American oil companies to disclose how climate change and future carbon taxes might affect the sustainability of their reserves, arguing that there is a risk to investors that many resources will need to be left in the ground.The future of oil will also be dependent on demand and prices. There is a hot debate among analysts about exactly when demand for oil will peak. Some note that with the economies of China and other developing countries growing, there are decades more of growth for oil. BP has projected that the global auto fleet will double by 2035 to 1.8 billion vehicles.But others say the electric cars and more efficient internal combustion engines will dominate transportation in the future, and deeply depress demand in gasoline and diesel. Several major car companies are investing in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, and Exxon Mobil is investing in advanced biofuels.Royal Dutch Shell has projected that gasoline demand is likely to peak by the 2030s. Chevron\u2019s departing chief executive, John Watson, recently said he was confident of demand growth for oil over the next decade or two.\u201cThere is no sign of peak demand right now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Won the Lottery and I Need Help. No, Really!", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealthWinning the lottery can be a bolt of amazing luck. But whether the luck lasts depends on whether lottery winners fritter away their unexpected largess or manage to achieve financial security.When Alcario and Carmen Castellano won $141 million in California more than a decade ago, they were fortunate enough to have a financial professional in the family to advise them. And one thing they learned early was to say no, said Mr. Castellano, now 83.People were constantly calling their San Jose home after they won in 2001, and many even knocked on their door, trying to persuade them to lend or give money. Mr. Castellano said that not long ago, an acquaintance asked for a personal loan. \u201cThat\u2019s not our goal,\u201d he quickly told the person. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that.\u201dWithin months of winning, the couple had to buy a more secluded house because they did not feel safe. He said, joking, that it was also \u201cbecause the Jaguar I gave my wife would have looked out of place in our old neighborhood.\u201dThe couple did spend on some indulgences, like new cars, but quickly set their spending priority, which was giving to Latino community organizations.Winners can display joyful exuberance at first, but then they often must deal with unanticipated stress. The psychologist Stephen Goldbart coined a phrase \u2014 sudden wealth syndrome \u2014 to describe symptoms, which include feeling isolated from friends, guilt over good fortune and extreme fear of losing newly gained money.Prize winners face adjustments when their financial status shifts radically. Extravagant spending, bad investments and other perils facing lottery winners are common enough that most state lotteries take pains to advise winners to seek out professional accounting and financial advice.\u201cNobody teaches you what to do with a large amount of money,\u201d said John Hagerty, a spokesman for the Virginia Lottery. \u201cWe give those who win $100,000 and up a video and a packet of information to help them prepare for their new financial lives.\u201dMichelle and Robert Sutherland of Oregon, who won $7 million in the state\u2019s lottery last June, had lost a large portion of their retirement savings in the 2008 economic meltdown, then lost more money later when they opened a restaurant.

They bought a \u201cnice, comfortable house but not a mansion\u201d outside Springfield, Ore., said Ms. Sutherland, 54. \u201cTo have that title in your hands is an amazing feeling.\u201dShe said that they had been able to spend some money on their family, and to set up substantial college funds for their three grandchildren.\u201cIt is very easy to fall into buying everyone the things they want,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we want to keep it the way it\u2019s been.\u201dWinners say there is no plan that works for everyone.\u201cThere is no one way when you win,\u201d said Amanda Spiller, 32, who claimed a $1 million Virginia Lottery prize in September 2015.

Their foundation focuses on arts and education groups, as well as on leadership and diversity issues.\u201cIt\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t have fun,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had a grand celebration on our 50th wedding anniversary. When we won, we had the means to help others, but it hasn\u2019t changed us.\u201cWe still have the same friends,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe foundation has helped us to develop our spending ideas, and develop an intuition about how to handle people that we don\u2019t know.\u201dMichael Moriarty, 56, a semiretired bartender from the Bronx, said he was using his windfall to \u201cbuild my little kingdom.\u201d He won $7 million this year from a New York scratch-off ticket, and he bought property in the Florida Keys for his family \u2014 he has three daughters \u2014 and to rent.\u201cI love Florida because it\u2019s a laid-back way of life, and I wanted something that could be an investment and also used by the family,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s a good investment to own property.\u201dHe gave $100,000 to his local Boys & Girls Club, where his brother is president, and treated his daughters to gifts, noting that they \u201chave gotten their fill of wants, not needs.\u201d He still routinely puts flowers on his mother\u2019s grave and bought himself a new Jeep, a new Harley-Davidson and a modestly priced boat as well as two fishing reels.\u201cPeople say you don\u2019t have to worry about money,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, that\u2019s all I worry about now.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly the lump sum payment received by Amanda Spiller, who won $1 million in the Virginia Lottery.

{"Headline": "Ready or Not, Recreational Marijuana Use Is Coming to Canada", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTIVERTON, Ontario \u2014 Behind a forbidding high-security fence topped with razor wire, Supreme Pharmaceuticals is busy preparing for the legal marijuana trade, with workers expanding a greenhouse complex where the lucrative crop grows.But while Supreme looks like it will be ready for the day when prohibition ends, Canada\u2019s governments still have a lot of work to do.Ottawa still has to set the limit at which drivers will be declared impaired under criminal law, and must determine the rules for advertising and the standards for growers.Working out most of the details affecting consumers is largely up to the 10 provinces. But only three \u2014 Alberta, Ontario and New Brunswick \u2014 have offered any idea of how they will operate and regulate their marijuana markets, and then only in the most general terms. The other seven are still in the midst of public consultations.Two of the most important questions for consumers \u2014 how much the legal product will cost and how much it will it be taxed \u2014 are still being debated by the two levels of government.In most of the country, it is still unclear whether marijuana will be sold only in government-run stores. And most provinces have yet to decide the amount of marijuana that individuals will be able to possess or grow.Nor have most provincial governments decided on the minimum age for buyers, or where smoking marijuana will be legal. The federal government must also explain how it will deal with international drug treaties that prohibit marijuana sales.Even the precise starting date for legal pot is a mystery.On top of that, and perhaps counterintuitively, police forces are warning that successful inauguration of a legal system for selling marijuana will require an accompanying crackdown on the black market.Despite all these challenges, suppliers are optimistic that legal recreational sales will be a reality by summer.\u201cI 100 percent think Canada will be ready,\u201d said John Fowler, the chief executive of Supreme, which has been selling medical marijuana since 2016. \u201cBut I think the real question is: What does \u2018ready\u2019 mean?\u201dThe answer, Mr. Fowler said, will be managing expectations in the early days.\u201cCanadians should not expect that on Day 1, the legal market is going to supply the billions of dollars of illegal cannabis being consumed in Canada,\u201d he said in his windowless office at the greenhouse complex near the shore of Lake Huron where employees work in disposable suits and hairnets to avoid contaminating the multimillion-dollar crop. \u201cThat will take time, and I think that\u2019s fine.\u201dEven with the uncertainty, many investors are betting there is money to be made on legal marijuana. Last month, Constellation Brands, a major wine and beer distributor in the United States, invested $245 million in Canopy Growth, the owner of several licensed medical marijuana growers in Canada.While the commercial side is upbeat, many provincial leaders say Mr. Trudeau\u2019s timetable of legalization by July \u2014 one of his main campaign promises \u2014 is unrealistic. Some have demanded a delay.In a statement, Brad Wall, the premier of Saskatchewan, said that he and several of his counterparts believed a postponement was needed to deal with all the questions.\u201cDespite these concerns, the federal government has not changed its timetable,\u201d Mr. Wall said.Speaking with reporters last month, Brian Pallister, the premier of Manitoba, said that his province is reluctantly working to meet the federal government\u2019s schedule.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I like it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to express my concerns about the rapidity of this change.\u201dBut Bill Blair, the former police chief of Toronto and a Liberal member of Parliament tasked by Mr. Trudeau with overseeing the marijuana issue, said that the government will stick with its plan. He dismissed suggestions that the process was rushed, noting that the federal government had been discussing the issue with provinces for two years.\u201cI don\u2019t minimize the complexity of the work ahead,\u201d Mr. Blair said on Friday. \u201cBut by establishing a date for implementation, it\u2019s focused the process.\u201d Further delay, he added, \u201cjust facilitates vast windfalls of profit to criminal enterprises.\u201dOf the three provinces that have released broad outlines, the plans put forth by Ontario and Alberta, although sketchy, treat marijuana much like alcohol.How the provinces and the federal government will divide the tax revenue is still unclear. Governments do not want a repeat of their experience with cigarettes, in which high taxes intended to discourage smoking created a large black market.Many police forces are among the groups calling for a delay. While a new law will allow the police to use saliva tests to identify marijuana-impaired drivers, what will qualify as impairment has yet to be defined. Little equipment to conduct the tests is now in the field, and few officers have been trained in its use.\u201cAre we going to be ready?\u201d asked Mario Harel, the president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the head of the force in Gatineau, Quebec. \u201cWe don\u2019t think so. We\u2019re dealing with a lot of situations so we\u2019re going to be doing our best to be as ready as possible.\u201dHis larger concern, he said, is changing public opinion about whether it is safe to drive under the influence of marijuana.\u201cThere\u2019s quite a common perception that you can drive safely under the influence of cannabis,\u201d Dr. Mann said, adding that this view is based in part on now-refuted research from about 20 years ago. \u201cIt took quite a while for people\u2019s attitudes about drinking and driving to change.\u201dMr. Trudeau\u2019s government has repeatedly said that the stores are illegal and will not be a part of the new recreational market.Brendan Kennedy, the president of Tilray, a licensed medical marijuana producer, said the experience of American states with legalization suggested that the stores will quickly wither away in the face of a legal alternative \u2014 provided that \u201cthere is adequate supply and adequate locations of legal products.\u201dMr. Harel, the police chief, is less certain the black market will vanish anytime soon after legalization.He anticipates that the illegal market will aggressively promote food laced with marijuana, one of many products that will not immediately be allowed under the new system. In his view, the success of the legal system will rest on swiftly and aggressively shutting down the black market.\u201cWe figure it\u2019s an $8 billion-a-year economy,\u201d he said of illegal marijuana sales. Legalization, he added, will change the dynamics of the black market. \u201cBut we don\u2019t think it will fade away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He will step down before the end of his 10-year term expires in January 2019 to pave the way for a successor, who will be responsible for regulating some of the world\u2019s largest banks.In his speech on Monday, Mr. Dudley cautioned against making broad changes to the Dodd-Frank Act, the web of rules and regulations put in place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to prevent a repeat meltdown. He urged that any alterations be made \u201cwith a paring knife, rather than with a meat cleaver.\u201d He specifically counseled against watering down rules that require banks to hold extra capital to absorb unexpected losses.\u201cWe should not lose sight of the horrific damage caused by the financial crisis, including the worst recession of our lifetimes and millions of people losing their jobs and homes,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. \u201cWe had a woefully inadequate regulatory regime in place, and while it is much better now, there is still work to do.\u201dMr. Trump and his top economic advisers have made no secret that they believe many post-crisis financial regulations overreached and are now restricting banks from making loans and trading securities.By disposition and tradition, Fed officials are wary about criticizing administration policies. In recent months, however, as the administration\u2019s criticism of the Dodd-Frank law have increased, the Fed\u2019s most senior leaders have become bolder in their defense of a tighter regulatory apparatus.\u201cThere has been a broad message from the leadership of the Fed that Dodd-Frank has been effective and that you have to leave it alone,\u201d said Chris Whalen, a financial consultant who worked at the New York Fed.Mr. Whalen said Mr. Dudley, more than any other Fed leader, was justified in arguing to keep a tight rein on banking activities.\u201cDudley did really well considering the magnitude of the collapse that occurred,\u201d Mr. Whalen said. \u201cThe Fed became a broker dealer overnight, and he had to oversee that.\u201dMr. Dudley worked at Goldman Sachs for 20 years before joining the New York Fed in 2007. He became president of the New York Fed in 2009, where he played a critical role as both a firefighter overseeing the bailouts of financial institutions and as one of the architects of the rules and regulations that followed.By law, Mr. Dudley would have to step down as president of the New York Fed by January 2019, as that would have been 10 consecutive years in the job.According to a person who was briefed on Mr. Dudley\u2019s thinking, his plan to leave the Fed six months early has been in the works for some time and was not related to Mr. Trump\u2019s bypassing Ms. Yellen for a second term as Fed chairwoman or the administration\u2019s more relaxed approach to financial regulation.\u201cThe American economy is stronger and the financial system safer because of his many thoughtful contributions,\u201d Ms. Yellen said in a statement.Unlike the Fed chairman, regional Fed presidents such as Mr. Dudley are not chosen by the president. They are selected by a committee composed of members of the Fed\u2019s board of directors who are not affiliated with financial institutions. The selection is subject to approval by the Fed board in Washington.Mr. Dudley called his time at the New York Fed \u201ca dream job\u201d in a statement on Monday, and he said he had \u201cevery confidence in the institution.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Save the SALT Deduction", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDo congressional Republicans and President Trump want to undertake a multitrillion-dollar federal bailout of states and cities? If not, the Senate and House should squelch their competing proposals to reduce or eliminate Americans\u2019 ability to deduct state and local taxes on their federal tax forms.Curtailing tax breaks is generally a good idea. Subsidies for certain activities distort the economy. When the mortgage-interest deduction spurs a family to buy a more expensive home than they would have otherwise, it keeps that money from more productive parts of the economy.But state and local tax deductions do not fall into this category. Since the nation\u2019s founding, American citizens have safeguarded small-scale democracy. The Bill of Rights prescribes that \u201cthe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states.\u201dScholars and judges differ over where state control ends and federal oversight starts. But no scholar argues that states, cities and towns don\u2019t possess the right and obligation to staff schools, pave roads, purify water and put out fires.For this, local and state governments need money \u2014 which they mostly get from their own taxpayers, not from Washington. To assert that the federal government has the primary claim on this tax dollar, as Republicans are doing, is to claim that the federal government bears the primary responsibility for these tasks.That\u2019s not a conservative argument, but a European one. In France, the national government, not Paris, stands behind a $37 billion \u201cGrand Paris\u201d plan to improve public transportation. In America, by contrast, Washington expects New York and New Jersey to bear half the cost of a new tunnel under the Hudson River, even though Amtrak, the national railroad, depends on this critical piece of infrastructure. Similarly, New York has received only $1.3 billion toward the $4.2 billion cost of the first three stops of the Second Avenue subway. The rest comes from New York taxpayers.Wealthier taxpayers do disproportionately benefit from these tax deductions, because they pay the most in taxes. In New York City, just 1 percent of tax filers \u2014 37,273 households \u2014 pay 49.3 percent of city income taxes. But their ability to deduct these taxes from federal taxable income is an indirect subsidy to New York\u2019s poorer and middle-class residents, who benefit from state and local spending on education, Medicaid, public safety and homeless services.If Congress were going to diminish America\u2019s local-governance model anyway, now is not the time. Nearly a decade into the economic recovery, state and local governments remain under fiscal stress, particularly when it comes to pension and health care promises to retirees.Chicago owes $45.2 billion to current and future public-sector pensioners, but had set aside only $9.5 billion as of the city\u2019s latest audited annual report. New Jersey and its local governments owe $122.2 billion, but have set aside just $53.7 billion. Even healthier governments, such as New York State and New York City, owe tens of billions of dollars in future health care payment obligations to retirees.As retirement costs have grown, state and local governments have cut back on infrastructure investments. Municipal debt \u2014 the mechanism through which governments borrow to build and maintain infrastructure \u2014 is 17 percent below its 2007 level after inflation.Republicans characterize this issue as a blue-state problem because blue states have higher taxes. But red states are struggling too. Texas owes $39.1 billion for pensions, but has set aside just $25 billion. Gulf states, including Florida and Louisiana, must invest in flood-protection measures. Houston voters approved new borrowing for such infrastructure this month \u2014 borrowing enabled by local tax deductions.Republicans also characterize the issue as one of local mismanagement. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to the federal government to save New York from its bad decisions,\u201d said Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, last week. True, governments from Chicago to New Jersey have made poor fiscal decisions. In a system that grants citizens great autonomy to govern themselves at the local level, disparities in financial management are inevitable. But it is none of Washington\u2019s business that New York\u2019s taxes are too high.One reality remains \u2014 somebody must pay. Three sources exist: taxpayers; public-sector retirees, via pension and health-benefits cuts; and municipal investors, via Detroit-style debt defaults in severe cases. Congress is making the first more difficult for state and local governments, and in most places, legal protections prevent governments from cutting pension benefits.That leaves bondholders. As the Standard & Poor\u2019s rating agency said this week, the overall impact of a tax plan that curtails state and local tax deductions \u201ccould be costly and detrimental to the credit quality of many public-finance issuers.\u201dSigning a bill into law that creates systemic distress for a financial market that affects the lives of all Americans is hardly the best way to improve the economy. And it may result in eventual tax increases, not tax cuts, at the federal level. Global investors may grow tired of America\u2019s lurching from crisis to crisis and raise the cost of federal borrowing, as well.Nicole Gelinas is a contributing editor to the Manhattan Institute\u2019s City Journal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Nationalism Jostles With Academic Freedom in Australia", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 It was a routine quiz in a university business class in Australia, but the answer to one of the questions was a surprise: Chinese officials are truthful only when careless or drunk.Under pressure, the university judged the question to be inappropriate, and it suspended the professor.\u201cAs China is becoming more and more powerful, we have strong backing even when we\u2019re overseas,\u201d said Mr. Gao, 24. \u201cWhen others find faults with China, we can stand up to them and tell them we Chinese are great.\u201dProfessors have been singled out by name and covertly videotaped. Some have been disciplined by their universities. One professor was forced to apologize after the internet erupted with criticism over a map that he had used in a class 18 months earlier.In many cases, professors say they feel the pressure more subtly.Kevin Carrico, an American lecturer in Chinese studies at Macquarie University in Sydney, said he faced icy silence in a recent class when he mentioned the lack of individual rights during the Qin dynasty, 2,200 years ago.The students, who mostly came from mainland China, at first refused to say a word. Then two spoke up to insist that human rights were irrelevant to the discussion.\u201cIt made me feel like I was teaching an awkward anatomy class, or something like that,\u201d said Dr. Carrico, who previously taught at Stanford. \u201cBut really we were just talking about politics.\u201dThe challenge, educators and other experts say, is balancing professors\u2019 academic freedoms with the need to avoid offending the Chinese students, while also giving them the right to voice their views.Universities have struggled to figure out which students simply lack experience with Western ideas of critical debate; which are correct in demanding more sensitivity; and which are being manipulated by the Chinese government or Communist Party, or acting out of fear of Chinese censorship that is being exported as the nation exerts its soft power overseas.Much of the students\u2019 prickly nationalism gets vented on social media, often anonymously, and then snowballs as it is picked up by news sites and internet users in China. As in the case of Mr. Gao, much of this appears to at least start as the authentic outrage of real Chinese students, sometimes based on genuine grievances.But in some cases, it appears to get support from Chinese diplomats and the state-run news media, who amplify the students\u2019 voices and reach out to student leaders. Mr. Gao, for instance, said he now is invited regularly to events at the Chinese Consulate, which asks him for reports on what is happening to Chinese students on campus. (An official at the consulate declined to comment.)Such attention from the authorities can also pressure Chinese students to self-censor for fear that they are being watched, even while abroad.According to Human Rights Watch, which is completing a two-year investigation into China\u2019s impact on the world\u2019s universities, Chinese government pressures are undermining academic freedom not only in Australia but also the United States and Europe.\u201cI first went to China to study myself in the fall of 1989,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, the China director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cTwenty-five years later, it\u2019s much easier for mainland students to go to Australia or the U.S. and study, and yet they are in some ways and in some cases as restricted or as surveilled as they would be if they had stayed at home. That, to me, is not the right direction for us to be going.\u201dThe students\u2019 assertiveness has posed a challenge not only to Australia\u2019s universities but also to its broader society, which prides itself on being a tolerant, multiethnic melting pot. The Australian news media has given the episodes intensive, often negative coverage, portraying the students as brainwashed or under the thumb of government agents. A backlash has appeared in the form of racist anti-Chinese scrawlings on campuses.\u201cWe need to be very conscious of the possibilities of foreign interference in our universities,\u201d Duncan Lewis, the head of Australia\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, warned lawmakers last month. \u201cIt can go to the behavior of foreign students, it can go to the behavior of foreign consular staff.\u201dAs a result, educators and other experts say, universities and faculty members have become especially vulnerable to pressure from Chinese students.In one case in late August, at the University of Newcastle in New South Wales, a group of Chinese students in an international marketing class took issue with their lecturer, Nimay Kalyani, when he referred to Taiwan as an independent country. China considers the self-governing island part of its territory.In the video, made public by the Chinese-language media, one student can be heard saying: \u201cChinese students are one-third of this classroom. You make us feel uncomfortable.\u201dThe university eventually spoke up on Professor Kalyani\u2019s behalf, describing his statement as accurate in the context of the discussion.But in other instances, universities have been more reluctant to defend the academics involved.Khimji Vaghjiani, a computer science lecturer at the University of Sydney, was found to have used a map during a class he taught 18 months earlier, showing India in control of disputed areas around its border with China.Chinese students reported the map to Chinese-language news media, describing it as inaccurate. Dr. Vaghjiani later apologized, explaining that the map was outdated.The professors involved in these episodes all declined, or did not respond to, requests for comment. The University of Sydney said in a statement that no professors had been forced to apologize for statements relating to China.But some faculty members said Australian universities were simply struggling with how to handle a new generation of Chinese students who feel more nationalistic and more empowered.\u201cTo many of them, it is not a question of a fair academic debate about an interesting topic,\u201d Dr. Varrall said. \u201cIt is as if someone is criticizing their family.\u201dSome Chinese students argue that they are not harming critical debates, but rather, adding perspective.\u201cThe confrontations between Chinese students and academics that have appeared recently are opportunities for people from different cultures to understand how Chinese people think,\u201d said Wang Junling, 38, a Chinese writer who graduated in June from James Cook University in Queensland.That sentiment was echoed by Mr. Gao, the Monash student, who said everything taught at Australian universities should be \u201ccorrect and official.\u201d\u201cI would like to say when we\u2019re abroad, we\u2019re representing the image of China,\u201d Mr. Gao wrote in one article on the quiz incident. \u201cIt is everybody\u2019s undeniable responsibility to defend our country\u2019s interests.\u201dMany academics say that is the kind of rigidity that limits freedom of discussion and that sets professors on edge.\u201cI don\u2019t want to wake up tomorrow morning and see a link on WeChat\u201d \u2014 a Chinese social media platform \u2014 \u201csaying that I said something in a lecture a year ago that hurt people\u2019s feelings,\u201d said Dr. Carrico of the University of Sydney. \u201cBut that\u2019s the kind of the reality we\u2019re in at the moment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Mugabe, in Speech to Zimbabwe, Refuses to Say if He Will Resign", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany political observers and fellow Zimbabweans had been expecting Mr. Mugabe to step down as president after nearly 40 years in power. But the embattled president gave a 20-minute televised speech that acknowledged problems in the nation \u2014 and he vowed to soldier on.\u201cThe era of victimization and arbitrary decisions\u201d must end, Mr. Mugabe said while sitting at a table, flanked by members of the military and other officials, including a priest.He also declared that he would oversee his governing party\u2019s congress in a few weeks. \u201cI will preside over its processes, which must not be prepossessed by any acts calculated to undermine it or to compromise the outcomes in the eyes of the public,\u201d he said.Mrs. Mugabe, who had amassed wealth and power in the party and was her husband\u2019s likely successor, has not been seen in public since Wednesday.The harsh rebuke by the party\u2019s central committee came after emergency talks to address the political crisis. Under the Constitution, Mr. Mugabe remains president despite the party\u2019s expulsion.Announcing the decision on Sunday, Patrick Chinamasa, the party\u2019s secretary for legal affairs, said that Mr. Mugabe \u201chereby is recalled as first secretary and president of the ZANU-PF party.\u201d\u201cHe is therefore asked to resign forthwith,\u201d Mr. Chinamasa said. \u201cIn the event that the resignation would not have been tendered by midday 20th of November, 2017, the ZANU-PF chief whip was ordered to issue proceedings for the removal of the president.\u201dCheers and dancing broke out in the building after the decision to expel Mr. Mugabe as party leader.\u201cThere is a case at the end!\u201d a group of youths chanted after storming an open space outside ZANU-PF headquarters.Many Western news outlets had alerted the world to a pending resignation, citing confidential sources. But it was not to be \u2014 at least in the speech on Sunday night.Mr. Mugabe made the rambling address to the southern African nation about 9 p.m. local time after intense negotiations at the State House with army generals over the conditions for his departure, the state broadcaster reported.\u201cI, as the president of Zimbabwe and their commander in chief, do acknowledge the issues they have drawn my attention to,\u201d he said, \u201cand do believe that these were raised in the spirit of honesty and out of deep and patriotic concern for the stability for our nation and for the welfare of our people.\u201dAmong the issues discussed was the economy, which, Mr. Mugabe allowed, was \u201cgoing through a difficult patch.\u201d He later said the government would unveil business and entrepreneurial programs to help the economy.\u201cToday\u2019s meeting with the command element has underscored the need for us to collectively start processes that return our nation to normalcy,\u201d he said, \u201cso all our people can go about their business unhindered, in an environment of perfect peace and security.\u201dAs his speech came to a close, he invoked a \u201cwartime mantra.\u201d He then said, \u201cI thank you, and good night.\u201d Then he shook the hands of the men who had appeared on camera with him.Once respected as a liberation icon who went into exile after fighting colonial rule, Mr. Mugabe had become isolated from fellow party officials. Zimbabwe\u2019s only leader since the country gained independence from Britain in 1980, he had faced little opposition from the party rank and file.But on Saturday, even his fellow veterans of the fight for independence joined the march of tens of thousands of Zimbabweans who danced and sang with joy at the prospect of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s tenure ending.On Sunday, Mr. Mugabe met for a second round of talks with the generals to negotiate a dignified departure, the state-run broadcaster said. A Catholic priest, Fidelis Mukonori, mediated.They urged the \u201cimmediate and unconditional reinstatement\u201d of Mr. Mnangagwa, at least until the national elections scheduled for next year. On Sunday, the leaders put force behind their recommendations.The party elevated Mr. Mnangagwa, 75, to the role of party leader and nominated him as its sole presidential candidate for the 2018 elections \u2014 a position that the committee said would be confirmed by the party\u2019s congress in December.Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s firing had positioned Mr. Mugabe\u2019s wife to succeed him as president, but it appears to have been an overreach that singled out an erstwhile ally with strong support from the military.The vice president, however, is seen as no salve for a nation facing steep unemployment and crumbling public infrastructure. Critics accuse him of being politically ruthless. He is also unpopular in parts of the country.Norimitsu Onishi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Sicily, a Voice of Discontent to Scare All Italy", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 The Five Star Movement, founded by the stand-up comic Beppe Grillo, did well in the election of a new governor of Sicily on Nov. 5. It scored the largest share \u2014 27 percent \u2014 of votes for any single party, and its candidate, Giancarlo Cancelleri, reached 35 percent and ran a close second to the winner, Nello Musumeci, the candidate of a center-right coalition of parties.This could well be the dress rehearsal for the general election next spring. The \u201cgrillini,\u201d as Mr. Grillo\u2019s followers are called, have a chance to topple the ruling Democratic Party, headed by Matteo Renzi, and the center-right coalition brought together by Silvio Berlusconi, Italy\u2019s irrepressible 81-year-old former prime minister. But the Five Star Movement refuses to form any alliances, making it unlikely to form a government and run the country.Unlikely, but not impossible. The leader of the right-wing Northern League, Matteo Salvini, said last week, \u201cI may give Beppe Grillo a call on election night if there are no clear winners\u201d in the national elections. The founder of Five Star quipped back in his blog: \u201cThey\u2019re stalkers. We don\u2019t want to have anything to do with them.\u201d But he\u2019s known for changing his mind.That\u2019s the kind of scenario that the European Union and the markets fear: two anti-establishment movements joining forces. The league and Five Star both dislike immigration, the European Union and the euro; both praise Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. No one can predict what a Five Star-Northern League government would do, nor how long it might last.Long enough to scare many people out of their wits, though. \u201cPopulist\u201d is Europe\u2019s word du jour. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of being a populist!\u201d Mr. Grillo recently said \u2014 in English \u2014 to a female BBC journalist (whom he then asked if he could kiss).But the term is misleading. Five Star is basically a protest movement: Its members rant against the establishment, but are better at complaining than doing anything. They benefit from the anger of a suffering lower-middle class, Italy\u2019s \u201cpiccola borghesia.\u201d Salaries haven\u2019t risen in a decade, successive waves of immigration from Africa are creating insecurity, and youth unemployment is at a record high. While overall unemployment is high, it is stable at 11 percent in northern and central Italy, where the economy is picking up. But it\u2019s rampant in the much poorer south; in Sicily it\u2019s 22 percent.So who exactly are the Five Star supporters? Some foreign observers see the party as genuine reformers; others as harmless buffoons. They are neither. They\u2019re the voice of Italy\u2019s discontent, as Donald Trump\u2019s voters were America\u2019s. We heard from his supporters in 2016; we may hear these voters \u2014 even louder \u2014 this spring. The Five Star and the League may not know where they are going, but they\u2019re going there fast, dragging half of Italy with them. The polls say Mr. Grillo\u2019s movement is attracting around 30 percent of voters nationally, and Mr. Salvini\u2019s league more than 15 percent.The Northern League is somewhat easier to pin down than Five Star. It was founded in the 1980s by Umberto Bossi, a university dropout who was considered a loose cannon. Then, in 1992 and 1993, corruption scandals brought down the traditional parties. Mr. Berlusconi, seeing his political mentors crumble, stepped in, formed his own party (Forza Italia) and enrolled the Northern League as his junior partner. Together they won the election in 1994.Since then, the Northern League has been in and out of government, and has gone on and off the idea of seceding from Italy. It has enjoyed the perks of power and a taste of the political dolce vita in Rome, a city the league members professed to despise. But it did better in the regions. Lombardy and Veneto \u2014 Italy\u2019s economic powerhouses \u2014 prospered under its stewardship or survived it, depending on whom you ask. This year, it decided that secession is out of fashion again. Mr. Salvini dropped the \u201cNorthern\u201d from its campaign in Sicily and made clear that he was no longer accusing the southern Italians for the country\u2019s problems; his supporters now have African migrants to blame instead.The Five Star Movement is quite different \u2014 a political construction unlike anything else in Europe. It has a rightist facade, over a leftist basement, under an anarchic roof. Its activists mistrust government, immigration, large corporations and, above all, science. Their belief that vaccinations are dangerous for children created havoc in Italian schools, forcing the government to intervene. Their core values are less government \u2014 with online referendums for everything, alongside conspiracy theories. And they respond aggressively on social media to anyone who dares to dissent. Journalists are singled out for hate messages.The internet is Five Star\u2019s terrain of choice. But this passion developed in a bizarre pattern. In the 1990s Mr. Grillo started touring Italy with sold-out one-man shows. Angry and funny, with a distinctive accent, scruffy beard and razor-sharp tongue, he had a way with audiences. He abhorred computers and the new media, and smashed P.C.s onstage with a hammer. Then came the internet, and with it a damascene conversion. He saw the web\u2019s potential and started blogging furiously until the blog became the movement.He did it with the help of a web wizard, Gianroberto Casaleggio, a spin doctor and architect of what the movement calls \u201cabsolute democracy.\u201d Recently, without consulting the party\u2019s members, Mr. Grillo enrolled Mr. Casaleggio\u2019s son Davide as his de facto deputy and put the leadership of the movement to an online vote on Five Star\u2019s interactive platform, titled Rousseau. Only 37,000 people voted, and the winner was 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio with 31,000 votes. Two other potential rivals, Alessandro Di Battista and Roberto Fico, had refused to enter the contest.Even though he never completed his studies and has never held down a proper job, Mr. Di Maio will be the party\u2019s candidate in March for prime minister. Five Star\u2019s supporters clearly like him, but the rest of Italy is puzzled. He\u2019s completely inexperienced. When given a chance to run things, \u201cgrillini\u201d have often proved incompetent. Under Mayor Virginia Raggi, for example, Rome is going down the drain.There really is nothing quite like these political forces in Europe. True, they share some elements with other protest movements: the anti-Brussels rhetoric of Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexiteers\u201d; some of the illiberal tendencies of the Dutch Freedom Party; the anti-establishment mood of France\u2019s National Front. And as Marine Le Pen did, Mr. Grillo had warm words for Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin (who is a role model for the Northern League\u2019s Mr. Salvini, too). Last January, Mr. Grillo said in an interview with a French newspaper: \u201cInternational politics need strong statesmen like them. I consider them a blessing for mankind.\u201dThis makes Five Star an ideal recipient for Russian help, now that national elections are approaching. And how does Russia help its friends? Through disinformation, mostly. It succeeded last year among Americans, after probably influencing Britain\u2019s Brexit vote, and this year it tried in France and Germany. Why not test Italy in 2018?On Nov. 3, on prime-time national television, I challenged Alessandro Di Battista, a Five Star spokesman and member of Parliament: \u201cDo you promise, here and now, that your party will never allow foreign misinformation to poison the forthcoming Italian election?\u201dHe promised solemnly that it won\u2019t.We\u2019ll see.Beppe Severgnini is the editor in chief of Corriere della Sera\u2019s magazine 7, the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Phil Murphy Is Elected Governor of New Jersey, in a Lift for Democrats", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byASBURY PARK, N.J. \u2014 New Jersey became the seventh state in the country where Democrats now control the legislative and executive branches with the election on Tuesday of Philip D. Murphy, a former Wall Street banker with no experience in office, as its 56th governor.The decisive victory by Mr. Murphy, who transformed himself from a Goldman Sachs executive into a progressive Democrat to match the direction of an anxious political party, gives Democrats a badly needed lift and a governor who has vowed to make his state a bulwark against the policies of President Trump.Mr. Murphy\u2019s ascendancy also brings an emphatic end to the tumultuous eight-year reign of Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who was once considered a viable contender for the White House but who leaves office as one of the country\u2019s least popular governors.Still, despite Mr. Murphy\u2019s skillfully managed campaign and ambitious agenda, it remains to be seen whether he can deliver on his many promises.Mr. Murphy, 60, easily defeated Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, the Republican candidate and Mr. Christie\u2019s second-in-command, by a margin of 56 to 43 percent, with 98 percent of precincts reporting, after a contentious election that never was really in doubt \u2014 Ms. Guadagno had struggled to move out of the shadow of her deeply disliked boss.Mr. Murphy, who promoted a liberal future for New Jersey with a $15 minimum wage, the legalization of marijuana and a vow to stand up to Mr. Trump, represents a shift in the state\u2019s reputation for electing moderate governors and makes it a deeper shade of blue.In his victory speech, Mr. Murphy made it clear that he believed voters had sent a message meant to reverberate beyond the state.\u201cWe will stand firm for New Jersey\u2019s values, and push back against the mean winds blowing at us from Washington,\u201d he told jubilant supporters in Asbury Park. \u201cThis is the first major election since Donald Trump was elected. Tonight, New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation \u2014 we are better than this.\u201dWith a win propelled by the working class and urban neighborhoods of northern New Jersey, Mr. Murphy\u2019s election also amounts to a repudiation of the hard-nosed, blunt conservative politics of Mr. Christie, whose tell-it-like-it-is personality often defined New Jersey on the national stage.In Mr. Murphy, voters selected Mr. Christie\u2019s opposite \u2014 an energetic politician who yearns to be liked, embraces unions, supports gun control and has been open about his willingness to raise taxes on the wealthy to help fix the state\u2019s floundering economy.But as an untested elected official, Mr. Murphy must prove that he can transform his experience on Wall Street and as the American ambassador to Germany \u2014 a position he won largely because he was a major Democratic donor \u2014 into an agenda that can chip away at the state\u2019s laundry list of problems, including soaring property taxes, underfunded schools, an enormous pension liability and poor public transit.Still, the outcome represents the triumph of a progressive message over a two-note focus on property taxes and immigration by Ms. Guadagno in a campaign that in many ways became a referendum on the Christie era.\u201cWe left no stone unturned, and we would not have done anything differently,\u201d Ms. Guadagno told disappointed supporters on Tuesday night during her concession speech in a ballroom in Aberdeen.Throughout the race, Mr. Murphy overshadowed his opponent by channeling his fellow residents\u2019 exasperation with the current governor, whose approval rating, in the low teens, ranks among the lowest in New Jersey\u2019s history, and using their anger to sell his plan to fix a state that he declared to be \u201cbroken.\u201dThe election of Mr. Murphy was yet another low-water mark in a long fall from grace for Mr. Christie, who once saw his approval ratings soar into the 70s and whose re-election margin in 2013 was so high that it instantly vaulted him into the presidential conversation.In the final weeks in New Jersey, Ms. Guadagno, perhaps sensing that she was not gaining any traction, veered toward a style of politics more akin to Mr. Trump\u2019s, campaigning against undocumented immigrants and running caustic ads that twisted Mr. Murphy\u2019s words about cities that offer them sanctuary.But support from Mr. Trump, who had been frantically tweeting about the Virginia governor\u2019s race for weeks, was nowhere to be found for Ms. Guadagno, nor did any Republican Party luminaries travel to the state to offer their support.From a campaign that began with a sharp focus on property taxes \u2014 she made a promise on primary night not to run for re-election if she failed to lower property taxes \u2014 Ms. Guadagno changed course and warned repeatedly that Mr. Murphy would turn New Jersey into a sanctuary state, hoping to energize the base of the Republican Party.But the strategy fell flat, particularly in a state where the successful Republican Party playbook, which guided Mr. Christie and former governors Christine Todd Whitman and Thomas Kean to victory in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, has relied on winning over the large swath of New Jersey\u2019s independent voters with a message focused on pocketbook issues.The Democratic-controlled state is also poised to play a significant role in the growing resistance to Mr. Trump. The Democratic Party has targeted New Jersey as a state where it hopes to achieve gains in the 2018 midterms. Mr. Murphy\u2019s victory, helped along by strong turnout in the northern part of the state, elevates the chances that incumbent Republican congressmen, like Representatives Leonard Lance and Rodney Frelinghuysen, can be defeated.The prospect of a competitive 2018 election loomed larger with the announcement on Tuesday that Representative Frank LoBiondo, a Republican, was retiring at the end of his term, providing Democrats another competitive battleground.Earlier in the day, Mr. Christie voted in his hometown, Mendham, and, perhaps not surprisingly, gave a local resident a taste of the brash politics that helped make him a national figure.Victoria Giambra asked Mr. Christie why he hadn\u2019t merged their municipality with the adjoining one \u2014 mergers are seen as a way to save money.\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he replied.But Ms. Giambra pressed him. Mr. Christie grew testy.\u201cEasier to sit here and complain, but you know what?\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cThat\u2019s the joy of public service. It\u2019s serving folks like you that is really such a unique joy. You\u2019re fabulous.\u201dMr. Christie also stressed that the election was not about him, his policies or his politics.\u201cMy referendum was four years ago,\u201d he said, noting that he won 61 percent of the vote in his re-election. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if anybody beats that record any time soon.\u201dIn his speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Murphy never mentioned Mr. Christie. But in an allusion to Mr. Christie\u2019s pugnacious style and the rancor of the Trump era, the new governor vowed to chart a different course.\u201cTonight,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cwe declare the days of division over.\u201dNate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Bridge to Crimea May Carry More Symbolism Than Traffic", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKERCH, Crimea \u2014 The looming bridge is the best show in town.Every two weeks, Nikolai Ench, a retired sailor, and his wife, Olga, scale the scrublands above Kerch in their white Toyota truck to marvel at the colossal engineering feat inching its way across the strait separating Crimea from the Russian mainland.\u201cThis is the first time they can build something like this in Russia,\u201d said Mr. Ench, 67, who even spent an entire night in August staring at the bridge through binoculars until construction workers slotted the first of two arches into place at what he said was exactly 7:27 a.m. \u201cWe feel a certain pride.\u201d\u201cIt is showing the world the great things it can do,\u201d said Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. \u201cThe government might not be able to provide safety, good health care and education, but it can provide big projects. If you cannot do bread, you can at least do circuses.\u201d\u201cIt signifies in the most visible way the connection between Crimea and Russia, that Crimea is part of Russia, connected to it by a solid bridge \u2014 that is as symbolic as it gets,\u201d Ms. Schulmann said.Mr. Putin has taken a keen public interest in the project, not least because the annexation of the Black Sea peninsula buoyed his political fortunes domestically by resurrecting the image of Russia as a muscular power.In Crimea, billboards bearing his picture and a quotation from him lauding the \u201chistoric mission\u201d of building the bridge loom over various potholed highways.When the project was first announced, however, it seemed that no Russian company wanted to touch it. There were extraordinary engineering challenges, and anything involving Crimea carried the risk of international sanctions. Even more daunting, perhaps, the ultimate project supervisor, known to be a demanding boss, was laying out a rigorous construction schedule.\u201cThe bridge itself is difficult, the scale is huge and it is tough to meet the deadline,\u201d said Oleg Skvortsov, a bridge specialist who led a 50-member expert advisory council. \u201cThe deadline was set by the president, so nobody wanted to take the risk.\u201dThere is some question whether Mr. Rotenberg volunteered or was pushed. The official version that he voiced himself is that no sacrifice is too great when serving the motherland, plus the bridge would stand as his crowning construction achievement.\u201cIt seems that this is the last big project for me, and I am doing it not to make money,\u201d he told the daily Kommersant in a 2015 interview. \u201cIf you permit me to say this, it is my contribution to the country\u2019s development.\u201dSpanning the Kerch Strait with a bridge has been proposed repeatedly for more than 100 years and even tried once before, but some combination of costs, war and Mother Nature doomed every previous effort.Not everyone is convinced the current effort will succeed, either.The strait runs between two mountain ranges, sending fierce winds howling through its narrow confines. The alluvial flow from various rivers has carpeted the seabed with 80 meters of fine silt. Ice floes crash through during the spring thaw \u2014 indeed, an ice floe sundered a German military bridge constructed during World War II \u2014 and the area is prone to earthquakes.For the new bridge to overcome those conditions, thousands upon thousands of pylons were driven into the seabed for stability. In addition, various parts were built using aerodynamics akin to an airplane wing, ensuring that the winds flow around the structure.\u201cAll this discussion about geology, ice, wind, waves \u2014 it would have been relevant 50 years ago,\u201d said Mikhail Y. Blinkin, the director of a transportation policy institute at Moscow\u2019s Higher School of Economics. \u201cNow, it is just a question of cost. It just gets more expensive, that is all, because there have been huge advancements in technology.\u201dOn the other hand, he noted, it is an interesting project for Russia\u2019s engineering and construction industry, which rarely faces such complicated tasks. The construction actually involves twin bridges \u2014 one for vehicles and a second due to open in 2019 for trains. Double arches rising about 115 feet above the water allow passage for ships.The huge costs involve not just the bridge, but also rail lines and highways linking to it, as well as a new highway across Crimea. The bridge has sucked up a significant portion of the budget for road and bridge construction throughout Russia, experts said, despite an official denial. The government plans to raise the gas tax in part to help pay for Crimea\u2019s development.\u201cThe fact that some other bridges are not being built, what can I say,\u201d said Mr. Skvortsov, the head of the advisory council. \u201cWe are short on bridges and roads. We do not have enough money, so there is a system of priorities.\u201dMr. Skvortsov confessed that he was once a skeptic, thinking like some others that a more modern, more efficient ferry service would be far cheaper and more practical. When finished, the bridge should be able to carry 40,000 vehicles and 94 trains a day. That is more cars in one day than the 38,000 the ferry transported during the entire month of December 2016, although 305,000 were transited that August, the peak tourist season.The Russian annexation of Crimea changed the calculations, however. Ukraine severed most transportation links, effectively isolating the peninsula. Kiev opposes the bridge.Some Crimeans consider the bridge the most tangible sign that Russia is improving their lot. \u201cFor more than 20 years everything was just collapsing, and now finally something is being built,\u201d said Nadezhda Nesterenko, 39, a postal worker who also regularly monitors the construction.Some residents hope the bridge will wrench Crimea out of its provincial doldrums, even if, for the moment, the main point appears to be solidifying Russia\u2019s claim to the peninsula.In ancient times, said Mr. Blinkin, the transportation expert, there were two philosophies behind road building. The Romans, he noted, extended highways everywhere to buttress their claim to their vast empire. By contrast, the Scythians around the upper reaches of the Black Sea avoided building roads to help keep enemies out.Russia adopted the latter attitude for centuries, Mr. Blinkin said. Leaders like Stalin shunned roads so that invaders could not come and Russians could not leave. Hence the Kerch bridge is a departure.\u201cPolitically, you had to build a physical connection,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you build a bridge somewhere, if you build a highway somewhere, you declare that this is yours.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Syria produces only a tiny fraction of global emissions, but every country that is party to the accord, including poverty-stricken and war-torn nations and tiny islands, has produced a plan for cutting carbon output.\u201cWe will get there,\u201d Ms. Shurbaji said. \u201cWe are in the process of becoming part of the agreement. We will have our commitments and targets.\u201dUnder the rules of the Paris agreement, the United States cannot formally withdraw until late 2020.

{"Headline": "Yellen\u2019s Legacy: Economic Progress but a Sense of a Job Unfinished", "Date": null, "News": "Advertisement\nBy most conventional measures, Janet L. Yellen\u2019s four years as the nation\u2019s top economic policymaker have been a success.Unemployment fell steadily during her term, inflation stayed in check and the Fed began backing gradually away from the extraordinary steps it took in the wake of the financial crisis.Ms. Yellen, who was serving as the Fed\u2019s vice chairwoman at the time of her appointment, was not the only person considered for the top job. President Barack Obama considered naming former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers to the post. Once Mr. Obama did nominate her, Ms. Yellen was confirmed on an unusually partisan 56-26 vote in the Senate.And once in office, Ms. Yellen continued to stir strong feelings. Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail accused the Fed under her leadership of imposing burdensome regulations on the financial industry \u2014 a complaint that may have contributed directly to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision not to reappoint her.Here is a closer look at Ms. Yellen\u2019s complex legacy.\u201cThe simple message is: The economy is doing well. We have confidence in the robustness of the economy and its resilience to shocks. It\u2019s performed well over the last several years.\u201dOther measures paint a more ambiguous picture, however. The share of working-age Americans who have jobs \u2014 a more comprehensive measure than the unemployment rate \u2014 remains below its prerecession level, and wage growth has been slow for much of Ms. Yellen\u2019s term. Both trends suggest that the Fed is still falling short of its \u201cmaximum employment\u201d mandate.Under Ms. Yellen, as under her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, a stronger economic recovery was always just around the corner.\u201cEven with the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive monetary policies, the recovery (both in the United States and around the globe) has fallen significantly short of predictions and has been far weaker than its predecessors.\u201dIt isn\u2019t clear what\u2019s behind those repeated disappointments, or how much Ms. Yellen or the Fed are to blame.Slow growth has been a problem across the developed world in recent years, and the United States has in fact outperformed many of its international peers. Some economists have pointed at demographics, globalization or other forces outside policymakers\u2019 control. But to the extent Ms. Yellen\u2019s policies were driven by her assessment of the strength of the economy, those assessments proved consistently too rosy.\u201cFor the last five or six years, the Federal Reserve keeps predicting inflation is around the corner. And those predictions end up being wrong.\u201dNeel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, March 2017When Ms. Yellen became chairwoman in February 2014, the Fed had held interest rates near zero for more than five years in an effort to revive the economy. With unemployment falling and inflation edging upward, she came under almost immediate pressure to raise rates. Instead, she waited nearly two years \u2014 until December 2015 \u2014 to do so, then another full year before doing so again.

It also embarked on a series of unusual or unprecedented steps: bailing out banks, buying up troubled mortgages and, later, injecting trillions of dollars directly into the economy through successive rounds of bond-buying known as \u201cquantitative easing.\u201dFor most of Ms. Yellen\u2019s tenure, her answer was \u201cnothing\u201d \u2014 the Fed bought new bonds to replace ones that were maturing, keeping its total holdings essentially flat. But in September, the bank said it would begin gradually paring its holdings by allowing some bonds to roll off its balance sheet.\u201cWe are working down our balance sheet because we feel that\u2019s stimulus that in some sense is no longer needed. So the basic message here is, U.S. economic performance has been good.\u201dThe unanimous decision was widely seen as a vote of confidence in the health of the United States economy. It will be months before it is clear whether that confidence was well placed.\u201cBelieve me: We\u2019re in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that\u2019s going to come crashing down.\u201dA Federal Reserve chief\u2019s every utterance can move global financial markets. Ms. Yellen\u2019s utterances, more often than not, moved them up.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the broadest measure of American stock market performance, is up by nearly half since Ms. Yellen took office, and the more technology-centric Nasdaq composite is up by two-thirds. Riskier assets have seen even bigger gains.\u201cAlready, for some, memories of this experience may be fading \u2014 memories of just how costly the financial crisis was and of why certain steps were taken in response.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Johnson.During Mr. Miller\u2019s presidency, Ford reported record sales and earnings, introduced the Mustang and other slick-back models and revolutionized its stodgy management and financial practices.When Congress demanded that Detroit do more to prevent accidents, Ford responded proactively by acknowledging that the industry had been slow to embrace auto safety and pledging to support whatever federal researchers recommended.As the dean of the Graduate School of Business at Stanford, in Palo Alto, Calif., for a decade, Mr. Miller expanded the curriculum to include public policy, social issues and ethics; hired the first women onto the faculty; recruited more minority students; increased the endowment; and upgraded the school into a worthy challenger to the business schools of Harvard and the University of Chicago.Mr. Miller was no ivory-tower dreamer or Detroit desk jockey, though.After riots devastated the slums of Detroit and other cities in the summer of 1967, he was named by President Johnson to a board that helped found the Urban Institute to address the underlying causes of the unrest. He also founded the Economic Development Corporation of Greater Detroit to support black-owned and black-operated businesses.Mr. Miller was the first major business executive to advocate a negative income tax to alleviate poverty \u2014 that is, giving a family with no income a basic grant and reducing but not eliminating it as the family gained income from other sources.His political philosophy combined social conscience with self-interest.\u201cAll we need to stay in business and grow,\u201d he once said, \u201cis to have more people and higher incomes.\u201dHe was credited with having an encyclopedic arsenal of facts and figures and an insatiable curiosity, which he had evidenced since childhood, when he completely dismantled a vintage Model T that he bought for $10 to understand how it worked.\u201cThe rescue of Ford from a morass of internecine chicanery and chaos cannot be laid at a single person\u2019s feet,\u201d Hemmings Classic Car magazine said in 2007, \u201cbut Miller unquestionably did a great deal of the heavy lifting to save the company.\u201cUnlike most heroes of the car business, he was not an engineer, stylist or designated product planner,\u201d the magazine continued. \u201cMiller was, instead, a person who could reconcile the realities of interpreting reams of data and inspiring others to apply it logically. His talent allowed him, in turn, to manage an unprecedented war, to help remake a troubled manufacturing giant, and to realize his ultimate legacy by grooming a new generation of top executives.\u201dArjay Ray Miller was born on March 4, 1916, in Shelby, Neb., a village west of Omaha. The youngest of eight children, he was named for the first initials of his father, Rawley John Miller, a farmer. His mother was the former Mary Schade.\u201cI always thought it was some help coming from a rural situation,\u201d Mr. Miller told The New York Times in 1966. \u201cYou aren\u2019t so perplexed about the world: Milk came from a cow, not from the grocery store. Eggs came from a chicken.\u201dAfter the family moved west, he earned a bachelor of science degree in finance and banking from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1937. As a teaching fellow and graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, he completed all the requirements for a doctorate except for his dissertation, then worked as an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.Once the United States entered World War II, he tried to enlist in the military but was initially rejected because of poor eyesight. He was later drafted into the Army Air Forces, where he taught prospective pilots on a flight simulator and then was enrolled in a statistical regime for officers at Harvard.When the war ended and he was discharged as a captain, Mr. Miller and the other nine members of his Harvard statistics group pitched themselves as a package deal to 100 companies. Only one, the Alleghany Corporation, responded.Before they could be interviewed there, Mr. Miller saw a cover article in Life magazine about Henry Ford II\u2019s search for executive talent to revive the company, which had been losing money for 15 consecutive years, and retool it to a civilian economy.After they sent a telegram to Ford requesting a meeting about \u201ca matter of management importance,\u201d the company hired all 10.Mr. Miller started in the finance department\u2019s analysis unit. Focusing on marketing and engineering, he was promoted to a vice presidency in 1957 and was named Ford\u2019s seventh president in 1963.\u201cWe\u2019re lucky in the auto business,\u201d he told The Boston Globe in 1966. \u201cSo many businesses have to work hard to create a demand. But for us, the minute a kid hits 16 he automatically wants a car.\u201dYet he resented the notion that he was just an astute bean counter.\u201cWe weren\u2019t a bunch of accountants,\u201d he told Automotive News in 2003. \u201cWe knew the importance of people.\u201dMr. Miller married Frances Fearing, an economist, in 1940; she died in 2010. They lived in Ann Arbor, Mich., a university town, rather than in Grosse Pointe or Bloomfield Hills, which were hubs for wealthy automobile executives.In addition to their son, Mr. Miller is survived by their daughter, Ann Elizabeth Olstad; three granddaughters; and seven great-grandchildren.In 1968, policy differences prompted Mr. Ford to name a new president. Mr. Miller became vice chairman of the company and dean at Stanford. He left as vice chairman a year later but stayed on the board until 1986.While his salary dropped to about $40,000 a year from more than $400,000, he had always preferred academia \u2014 and besides, he still held Ford stock. He remained as dean at Stanford until 1979.Mr. Miller was a leading proponent of incorporating ethics and social responsibility into the curriculum to lay the groundwork for cooperation between government and business.\u201cThere are plenty of people in jail today,\u201d he said, \u201cwho passed college ethics courses.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "White-on-White Voting", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2012, Dravosburg backed Barack Obama over Mitt Romney 441 to 312, or 53.4 percent to 44.8 percent.What is so interesting about this working-class community, with its strong ties to organized labor? It is one of thousands of white enclaves across the nation that provided Trump with his margin of victory.The election of Donald Trump revealed that in some of the nation\u2019s whitest municipalities and counties \u2014 the communities arguably most insulated from urban crime, immigration and gangs \u2014 Trump did far better than Romney had done four years earlier.The 2016 results suggest that residents of a diminishing number of decisively white American towns and small cities \u2014 even those which supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 \u2014 can now be politically mobilized around race, ethnicity, multiculturalism and immigration.None of the nation\u2019s whitest municipalities and counties \u2014 especially those in the Trump-voting Midwest \u2014 is immune.Where are the overwhelmingly white localities experiencing the most rapid rate of minority population growth, although the absolute numbers themselves are small? They are in the part of the nation\u2019s heartland \u2014 Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania \u2014 where Trump earned enough Electoral College support to win the presidency even as he lost the popular vote.In 2008, Elk County residents voted 51-47 for Obama over McCain. In 2012, the county backed Romney over Obama 57-41. In 2016, Trump swept Elk County, 69-27.The graphic ranks, left to right, the percentage of whites in every municipality within the nation\u2019s top 50 metropolitan areas. The red line shows where Trump did less well than Romney and where he did much better.Will Stancil, a research fellow at the Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity who created the chart, explained to me in an email thatnationally, Trump mostly lagged behind Romney. But in the limited selection of communities where his message hit home, it really hit home, with large gains over Romney really running up the score. These places were very heavily white.Orfield described the charts in an email:Trump\u2019s vote skyrocketed in very white suburbs. In the more racially diverse suburbs, particularly those that had been diverse for more than a decade, the white vote for Trump did not increase over Romney\u2019s vote. But in the very white suburbs, particularly in very segregated areas of the Midwest and Northeast, Trump\u2019s vote jumped enormously over Romney\u2019s.The very white municipalities that voted so strongly for Trump believe that they have reason to worry about the racial stability of their neighborhoods.The percentage of suburbanites living in racially diverse areas \u2014 defined as 20 to 60 percent minority \u2014 grew over that decade from 38 to 44 percent. Those neighborhoods often remain in flux.\u201cFifty-six percent of the neighborhoods that were integrated in 1980 had become predominantly nonwhite by 2010,\u201d Orfield and Luce wrote, \u201cand only 40% of neighborhoods that were integrated in the 1980s remained in that category in 2010.\u201dTrump\u2019s anti-immigrant, racially loaded messages resonated most powerfully among voters living in the least diverse, most racially isolated white communities. It is in these locales, which are experiencing the earliest signs of minority growth, that anxiety over approaching diversity is strongest.Put another way, anger, fear and animosity toward immigrants and minorities was most politically potent in the communities most insulated from these supposed threats.Trump clearly inflamed and mobilized white voters living in these circumstances. Neither Romney nor John McCain, the previous two Republican nominees, campaigned on racially freighted issues and neither produced the same pattern of support.\u201cTrump,\u201d Alan Berube, deputy director of the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program, wrote in an email,got a particular boost from small, overwhelmingly white communities threatened not only by real forces of technological change and trade, but also by the specter of immigrants and other nonwhites making gains at their expense in America\u2019s economy and society.As the accompanying graphic shows, in the four key Rust Belt states that handed Trump the presidency, the same pattern of voter mobilization in ultra-white districts emerges even more forcefully.\u201cTo the extent Trump really resonated, it was in heavily-white areas \u2014 and that includes exurbs at the urban fringe, rural areas, and many heavily white second-ring suburbs,\u201d Stancil wrote in his email. \u201cIt was his message resonating in those areas that gave him a fighting chance at all.\u201dIn some respects, the data gathered by Orfield\u2019s team is good news for Democrats. The core of Trump\u2019s support lies in counties and municipalities like Dravosburg and Elk County, many of which are losing population. They are, in effect, the last gasp of white hegemony.Still, immense damage has been done.The consequences?As the public discourse around issues of social welfare, immigration, national security, and a whole host of other issues becomes highly racialized and explicitly hostile, the potential for open racial conflict may rise. Furthermore, as these negative attitudes toward racial outgroups become increasingly tightly tied to parties, polarization increases and gridlock and a lack of legislative compromise ensue.When I look back at the 2016 election, what is really striking is how much influence over the course of events was exercised by the relatively small numbers of voters in super-white municipalities and counties and by the politician who ignited them \u2014 how the last gasp of a small fraction of the electorate set the nation on such a dangerous and destructive course.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Departures Promise to Reshape the House, Whether or Not Election Does", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In his five years as chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, Representative Lamar Smith transformed the once almost invisible position into a powerful bully pulpit. From it, he tried to dismantle Obama-era climate policies, undermine scientific consensus and browbeat federal agencies for what he called scientific fraud.But with his run as chairman nearly done, the 69-year-old Texan announced on Thursday that he would retire rather than seek a 17th term in Congress and a spot on the backbench. The news followed closely on the heels of another powerful Texas Republican facing the end of his chairmanship, Representative Jeb Hensarling of the Financial Services Committee, who said just two days earlier that this term would be his last.With a year left before the midterm elections, the line of senior House Republicans heading for the exits continues to grow. Democrats argue that the wave of retirements will help them retake the House.But regardless of who controls the chamber come January 2019, it is becoming increasingly clear that the House will be a different place, with some of its biggest personalities and powerful committee and subcommittee leaders leaving it behind.\u201cPart of our original thinking was there is always new talent, there are always new people,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker who in 1994 instituted a three-term limit for top Republican committee positions. \u201cI don\u2019t know that having fresh blood is necessarily a bad thing.\u201dHe did add, however: \u201cIt means we\u2019ll have a few more tough races next year. It means you have less legislative experience, and it is much harder to manage.\u201dBeyond Mr. Smith and Mr. Hensarling, those seeking to depart include Representatives Lynn Jenkins of Kansas, a longtime member of leadership; Jason Chaffetz of Utah, who was the chairman of the high-profile Oversight Committee; Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a moderate but strong voice in Republican foreign policy; Diane Black of Tennessee, the first woman to lead the Budget Committee; and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, an Appropriations subcommittee chairman and the leader of House Republican moderates.Those numbers are expected to rise in the coming weeks, as filing and fund-raising deadlines for next year\u2019s election approach. Just how high could depend on the success or failure of Republicans\u2019 latest legislative push, an ambitious rewrite of the federal tax code that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin has pledged to get through the chamber in a matter of weeks. Should the effort fail, current and former lawmakers said, the number of demoralized Republicans leaving the chamber could jump.\u201cEach of us will have our own individual stories, but the promise of unified government is much more difficult, cumbersome and elusive than we ever thought it would be,\u201d said Mr. Chaffetz, 50, who stepped down in June to take a job at Fox News. \u201cYou have people who are frustrated they can\u2019t get their legislation to the finish line.\u201dRepublican campaign strategists and congressional aides said they were watching at least two other committee chairmen facing term limits for potential retirements: Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, who is the chairman of the Transportation Committee, and Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.Mr. Smith, a long-serving conservative and former Judiciary Committee chairman, said the decision to retire was largely personal. He wrote on Thursday that with his chairmanship ending and a new grandchild arriving, the time felt right to step aside after 16 terms.\u201cIt is humbling living in a small apartment in Washington four nights a week,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd I seldom leave the office before late at night.\u201dMr. Smith took over the science panel in 2013 and turned it into a powerful counterweight to Obama administration environmental policy. He subpoenaed scientists, accused federal agencies working on climate change of engaging in scientific fraud and supported stripping NASA of much of its climate change research. News of his departure has been as polarizing as his chairmanship.Myron Ebell, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank, and a leading contrarian of the scientific consensus on global warming, said Mr. Smith\u2019s retirement was a \u201chuge loss to the science community.\u201dScientists who have clashed with him, though, said they were hopeful that his departure would mark a return to a less adversarial body.\u201cChairman Smith misused his position to subpoena federal researchers, sow doubt about scientific facts and push bills that would undermine the role of science in policy,\u201d said Andrew Rosenberg, the director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\u201cI hope that the next representative to serve as chair will return this committee to its intended purpose: strengthening America\u2019s scientific enterprise, providing thoughtful and constructive oversight of federal policy and protecting the health and safety of the people Congress is supposed to serve,\u201d he said.The push has so far failed, but the agency\u2019s largest transactions have been crippled for nearly two and a half years by conservative actions on Capitol Hill.But his work in Washington was marked by frustration, as well. A sign of how difficult it has been to see legislation into law: His Financial Choice Act stands a slim chance of passing the Senate, where Republicans hold only a narrow majority.Dick Armey, a former House majority leader under Mr. Gingrich and a fellow Texan, said Mr. Hensarling\u2019s departure struck him as premature and a casualty of the sort that Republicans had brought upon themselves.\u201cI have no doubt he\u2019s frustrated,\u201d Mr. Armey said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be as able and as innovative a guy as Jeb is without being frustrated right now.\u201dOthers drew different lessons.Representative Louie Gohmert, a Tea Party conservative who has clashed with party leadership over the years, said the departures of his fellow Texans, Mr. Smith and Mr. Hensarling, were merely part of the natural cycle of life in the House.\u201cNobody lasts up here forever,\u201d Mr. Gohmert said as he left the House floor on Thursday. \u201cAnd if they do, they shouldn\u2019t.\u201dLisa Friedman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Post Office Fails to Deliver on Time, and DACA Applications Get Rejected", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe paperwork was mailed from New York in plenty of time. On Sept. 14, Allison Baker, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society, sent a client\u2019s application to renew a permit that would let him stay and work in the United States legally as part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u2014 long before the Oct. 5 deadline. It was sent certified mail to be safe.Then the packet started circling Chicago in a mysterious holding pattern. From Sept. 17 to Sept. 19, it was \u201cin transit to destination.\u201d Then its tracking whereabouts disappeared until Oct. 4. Once again, it was \u201con its way.\u201dOn Oct. 6, a day too late, it was delivered. And the application, for a 24-year-old man who asked to be identified only as Jos\u00e9 because his legal status was uncertain, was rejected.Jos\u00e9 was not alone. According to lawyers from across the New York region, in at least 33 other cases, unusually long Postal Service delays resulted in rejections of DACA applications, throwing the lives of their clients into frantic limbo. Lawyers in Boston and Philadelphia, which also send their applications to the Chicago processing center, say they have not seen evidence of an issue with the mail.But in Chicago, in the backyard of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, there were at least 41 DACA recipients whose renewals, sent well before the deadline, arrived late, advocates said. According to Representative Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez, Democrat of Illinois, an applicant sent a renewal on Sept. 13 and it arrived on Oct. 6. Another sent the paperwork on Sept. 21, and it was received on Oct. 9. \u201cBecause somebody else did not do their job correctly we are taking innocent young immigrants and making them deportable,\u201d said Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez in a statement. \u201cThat is unacceptable.\u201dOn Thursday, in a rare admission from a federal agency, the U.S. Postal Service took the blame. David A. Partenheimer, a spokesman for the post office, said there had been an \u201cunintentional temporary mail processing delay in the Chicago area.\u201dBut the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency said nothing more could be done; the decisions were final.\u201cAccording to U.S.C.I.S. regulations, a request is considered received by U.S.C.I.S. as of the actual date of receipt at the location for filing such request,\u201d Steve Blando, a spokesman for the agency, wrote in a statement. He added: \u201cU.S.C.I.S. is not responsible for the mail service an individual chooses, or for delays on the part of mail service providers.\u201dHe later added, though, that \u201cU.S.C.I.S. is committed to working with the U.S.P.S. to understand and address the U.S.P.S. error that occurred that delayed the mail.\u201dBecause DACA is an executive order, signed by President Barack Obama in 2012, and not a statute, applicants cannot appeal the decision. Still, immigrants and their advocates viewed the agency\u2019s unwillingness to revisit their applications as harsh and unfair.The DACA program had offered temporary protection and work permits for about 800,000 young adults who had been brought to the United States illegally as children.There are three U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services intake locations, known as lockboxes, in the United States: in Phoenix, Chicago and Lewisville, Tex., a suburb of Dallas.According to the immigration agency, its employees do not pick up the mail from the lockbox. The United States Department of the Treasury manages the process but uses a courier service that picks up the mail from post offices each morning. Express Mail items, the agency said, are picked up in the afternoon. Also, items are delivered to the lockbox by the courier services FedEx, DHL and the United Parcel Service.In a memo after DACA was rescinded, the Department of Homeland Security said renewals had to be \u201caccepted\u201d by Oct. 5. Immigration lawyers contrasted that with a permanent residency opportunity the government offered in 2001, when applications only had to be postmarked by the deadline of April 30. Acknowledging the high volume of applications, the government offered a grace period for paperwork to be received by May 3.Immigration lawyers questioned why that was not an option in this case.Hasan Shafiqullah, director of the immigration unit of the Legal Aid Society in New York, was disturbed by the lack of compassion from the agency.\u201cFrom the clients\u2019 perspective, they did the right thing,\u201d Mr. Shafiqullah said. \u201cFiling three weeks before should be sufficient, and U.S.C.I.S. needs to recognize that and needs to exercise discretion.\u201dShe had installed two apps on her phone to track her application in the mail, but she became anguished when they showed her envelope had arrived in Chicago on Oct. 1 but seemed to stall there. She called every supervisor she could in the Chicago post office.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense, I mail stuff all the time,\u201d Ms. Camara said. \u201cI can understand one day of delay. Two days at most. But you can\u2019t even tell me where it is?\u201dAccording to the tracking record, her application arrived \u201cat the unit\u201d on Oct. 5, but was not actually delivered until Oct. 6.She said she made an appointment to discuss the application with an immigration official next week. Five lawyers in New York said they had already received denials from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency when pleading their case \u2014 via email, an 800-number and in person.The older brother\u2019s application was in transit for three weeks; it did not arrive at the regional facility in Chicago until Oct. 3. At that point, Ms. Bennett-Rodriguez raced to find a solution.When it still had not arrived, hours before the deadline, she said that her client offered to fly from La Guardia Airport to Chicago to hand-deliver his application. But she learned there was no physical address listed for where he would go.The post office tracking information showed his application arrived on Oct. 6.\u201cIt was probably my worst day as an attorney,\u201d Ms. Bennett-Rodriguez said. \u201cI knew the importance and I knew we filed with enough time.\u201dMr. Partenheimer, the post office spokesman, said the processing \u201cissue has been resolved and we are investigating how it occurred.\u201d He added that the mail service would \u201cwork diligently\u201d with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency \u201cconcerning any potential issues this may cause for the affected individuals.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a deposition in a federal lawsuit. It was not conducted by the immigration advocacy group Make the Road and did not include the number of applications received on time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Four Big Tax Deceptions", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet the plan\u2019s defenders continue to describe it as a \u201cbeautiful\u201d thing (President Trump\u2019s word) that would transform the economy and bestow gifts on ordinary Americans. How do they keep making these claims? I count four major tactics that they\u2019re using:But it actually describes a very different plan, a \u201crevenue-neutral\u201d plan that would offset its corporate tax cuts with fewer corporate loopholes. The Senate bill is radically different from this imaginary plan the economists are praising. Instead of being revenue neutral \u2014 technical talk for a bill that neither grows nor shrinks the deficit \u2014 the Senate plan would increase the deficit by more than $1 trillion over its first decade.The open letter is just one example of this deception. The bill\u2019s defenders frequently say some version of, \u201cWe need tax reform.\u201d But their plan bears little resemblance to meaningful tax reform. It\u2019s akin to telling someone, \u201cYou need a new car,\u201d and then giving the person a lemon.2. Talk about the plan\u2019s middle-class tax cuts \u2014 and ignore the middle-class tax increases. One favorite sleight of hand from the plan\u2019s supporters is to talk only about the provisions that help the middle class and conveniently fail to mention the other parts.All that is true. Unfortunately, Senator Portman left out the elimination of the personal exemption, which protects $4,000 per person from income taxes. He left out the elimination of various tax breaks that help the middle class. And he left out the introduction of a new inflation measure that will push more families into higher tax brackets over time.3. Pretend that the future will never arrive.To hold down the estimated cost of the bill, Senate leaders have set some of its biggest provisions \u2014 the ones that most benefit the middle class \u2014 to expire over the next decade. The corporate tax cuts, by contrast, are permanent.But when the plan\u2019s defenders describe the bill, they tend to be talking about a point before the bill is fully implemented \u2014 without admitting as much. If you hear a senator talking about a $1,000 tax cut that a typical middle-class family would receive, it\u2019s in one of the plan\u2019s early years.(If you hear a senator talking about a bigger tax cut, as Portman and many others do, they\u2019re usually talking about the upper middle class or affluent without saying so.)By the time the bill is fully implemented, it will be a net tax increase on every income group below $75,000 a year. It will also leave federal taxes virtually unchanged for families making between $75,000 and $100,000. For the wealthy, it\u2019s still a tax cut.4. Rush, rush, rush. Perhaps the biggest giveaway about the plan is the way that its supporters are trying to push it through Congress as quickly as possible.They\u2019re not holding hearings where experts can debate the content of the plan. They are not even waiting for a final analysis from Congress\u2019s official tax arbiter, the Joint Committee on Taxation. They understand that facts and debate hurt their cause. They are hoping that partisan loyalty is strong enough to overcome substance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tim Wu: Why the Courts Will Have to Save Net Neutrality", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBack in 2005, a small phone company based in North Carolina named Madison River began preventing its subscribers from making phone calls using the internet application Vonage. As Vonage was a competitor in the phone call market, Madison River\u2019s action was obviously anticompetitive. Consumers complained, and the Federal Communications Commission, under Michael Powell, its Republican-appointed chairman, promptly fined the company and forced it to stop blocking Vonage.That was the moment when \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules went from a mere academic proposal to a part of the United States legal order. On that foundation \u2014 an open internet, with no blocking \u2014 much of our current internet ecosystem was built.Allowing such censorship is anathema to the internet\u2019s (and America\u2019s) founding spirit. And by going this far, the F.C.C. may also have overplayed its legal hand. So drastic is the reversal of policy (if, as expected, the commission approves Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal next month), and so weak is the evidence to support the change, that it seems destined to be struck down in court.The problem for Mr. Pai is that government agencies are not free to abruptly reverse longstanding rules on which many have relied without a good reason, such as a change in factual circumstances. A mere change in F.C.C. ideology isn\u2019t enough. As the Supreme Court has said, a federal agency must \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.\u201d Given that net neutrality rules have been a huge success by most measures, the justification for killing them would have to be very strong.It isn\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s very weak. From what we know so far, Mr. Pai\u2019s rationale for eliminating the rules is that cable and phone companies, despite years of healthy profit, need to earn even more money than they already do \u2014 that is, that the current rates of return do not yield adequate investment incentives. More specifically, Mr. Pai claims that industry investments have gone down since 2015, the year the Obama administration last strengthened the net neutrality rules.But Mr. Pai faces a more serious legal problem. Because he is killing net neutrality outright, not merely weakening it, he will have to explain to a court not just the shift from 2015 but also his reasoning for destroying the basic bans on blocking and throttling, which have been in effect since 2005 and have been relied on extensively by the entire internet ecosystem.This will be a difficult task. What has changed since 2004 that now makes the blocking or throttling of competitors not a problem? The evidence points strongly in the opposite direction: There is a long history of anticompetitive throttling and blocking \u2014 often concealed \u2014 that the F.C.C. has had to stop to preserve the health of the internet economy. Examples include AT&T\u2019s efforts to keep Skype off iPhones and the blocking of Google Wallet by Verizon. Services like Skype and Netflix would have met an early death without basic net neutrality protections. Mr. Pai needs to explain why we no longer have to worry about this sort of threat \u2014 and \u201cYou can trust your cable company\u201d will not suffice.Moreover, the F.C.C. is acting contrary to public sentiment, which may embolden the judiciary to oppose Mr. Pai. Telecommunications policy does not always attract public attention, but net neutrality does, and polls indicate that 76 percent of Americans support it. The F.C.C., in short, is on the wrong side of the democratic majority.In our times, the judiciary has increasingly become a majoritarian force. It alone, it seems, can prevent narrow, self-interested factions from getting the government to serve unseemly and even shameful ends.

But its core premises \u2014 that American voters are hostile to progressive economics and have punished the (increasingly left-wing) Democratic Party accordingly \u2014 actually rest on ideological conviction, not empirical evidence.In truth, the Republican Party\u2019s dominance has little to do with the American electorate\u2019s \u201ccenter-right\u201d ideology. We know this for two simple reasons: First, the vast majority of that electorate has no ideology, whatsoever. And second, when polled on discrete policy questions, Americans consistently express majoritarian support for a left-of-center economic agenda.This make intuitive sense: The left-to-right political spectrum is a construct born of seating arrangements during the French Revolution. The impulse to define oneself in relation to an in-group \u2014 and opposition to an out-group \u2014 is a survival strategy that\u2019s been with us since the dawn of our species.Meanwhile, the number of genuine \u201cliberals\u201d and \u201cconservatives\u201d is far smaller than meets the eye. Most voters who identify with those terms are partisans first, and ideologues second. Or as Mr. Kinder and Mr. Kalmoe conclude an analysis of four decades of voter survey data, \u201cideological identification seems more a reflection of political decisions than a cause.\u201d In other words: The average conservative Republican isn\u2019t a Republican because she\u2019s a conservative \u2014 she self-identifies as a conservative because she\u2019s a Republican.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fewer Foreign Students Are Coming to U.S., Survey Shows", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe first new college class since the election of Donald J. Trump has arrived on campus, and new numbers confirm what the higher education industry had feared: Fewer foreign students are coming to the United States.Experts cited an uncertain social and political climate in the United States as part of the reason for the decline in enrollment.\u201cIt\u2019s a mix of factors,\u201d said Rajika Bhandari, head of research for the institute, which collects data on international students in cooperation with the State Department. \u201cConcerns around the travel ban had a lot to do with concerns around personal safety based on a few incidents involving international students, and a generalized concern about whether they\u2019re safe.\u201dAnother reason for the decline is increasing competition from countries like Canada, Britain and Australia, said Allan E. Goodman, president of the institute.The figures released Monday also included final numbers for 2016-2017, which show robust international enrollment, with a record 1.08 million international students in the United States, an increase of 85 percent from a decade earlier.Much of the record was driven by 175,000 students who have remained in the United States after completing their degrees, in internship-type programs known as \u201coptional practical training.\u201dThe 2016-2017 figures, though, revealed that first-time international students dropped 3 percent, indicating that the decline had begun before President Trump took office.The drop in new students signals potential financial difficulties for some small universities that have come to rely on money from foreign students, who provide an infusion of $39 billion into the United States economy each year.Particularly hard hit are campuses in the Midwest, according to the institute.At the University of Iowa, overall international enrollment this fall was 3,564, down from 4,100 in 2015.Downing Thomas, the university\u2019s dean of international programs, said that some other schools in the Big Ten are also experiencing declines, and none are seeing the rapid increases of the recent past.While Iowa primarily lost Chinese students, the University of Central Missouri experienced a sharp decline this year in students from India, said Mike Godard, vice provost for enrollment management.In the fall of 2016, the Warrensburg, Mo., university had 2,638 international students. This fall it has 944.Dr. Godard said fewer students came from India partly because of a currency crisis in the country, but also because of concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban affecting Muslim countries. India was not on that list, but Dr. Godard said many of the university\u2019s Indian students were from Muslim areas of the country and were concerned about the ban.\u201cAlthough India wasn\u2019t listed as one of the countries, certainly feeling welcome and safe and all those things is important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be na\u00efve to say that wasn\u2019t a contributing factor.\u201dA breakdown of declines by country was not yet available for fall 2017.In fall 2016, the sharpest drops nationally from a year earlier involved students from Brazil and Saudi Arabia, which cut back on funding international scholarships.Advertisement"}

Most important, he became one of the most accomplished hockey players in the United States in a generation, scoring goals for the city\u2019s championship-starved Washington Capitals.\u201cMy second home,\u201d the star player, Alexander Ovechkin, said of the city.But about that first home.In a political season of investigations into Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and the ever-invisible hand of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Ovechkin \u2014 a LeBron James-style prodigy with three M.V.P. awards, impish charisma and a gaptoothed grin \u2014 has glided into the zeitgeist with his own Washington mystery: He is the stickhandling hero who may or may not be a witting font of Kremlin propaganda in the United States\u2019 capital.\u201cIt\u2019s all about country,\u201d Mr. Ovechkin said in an interview, semicryptically, from across a conference room table at the team\u2019s practice facility in Arlington, Va. \u201cI just want to do my best for my country.\u201dThis month, Mr. Ovechkin announced the creation of a \u201ccivic movement\u201d he has called \u201c#putinteam,\u201d a demonstration of support for Mr. Putin, his most powerful admirer, months before the country\u2019s election next year. (The two are close enough that Mr. Putin called Mr. Ovechkin at his wedding reception last summer, and gifted him a premium tea set.)Mr. Ovechkin, 32, insists the idea was his, unconnected to the Russian leader or his allies. \u201cPutin\u2019s Team is Putin\u2019s Team,\u201d Mr. Ovechkin said, in his first extended interview on the subject. \u201cIt is just for people who support the country, and basically it\u2019s a simple thing.\u201dBut experts in Russian politics, where star athletes are often deployed for popular cover, are exceedingly skeptical. News reports in Russia have linked the campaign to a major public relations firm, which is said to have devised \u201cPutin Team\u201d before securing the blessing of the president\u2019s orbit. (The firm has denied this.) And while Mr. Putin\u2019s electoral prospects are hardly in doubt, the backing of prominent athletes is viewed as helpful in projecting mass popularity at home and abroad.American officials say they believe Mr. Ovechkin is most likely being used for precisely this sort of hearts-and-minds campaign aimed at garnering good will for Mr. Putin, whether or not Mr. Ovechkin is particularly conscious of this. The matter is not the highest of priorities for intelligence and law enforcement officials, who both laughed when first asked about \u201cPutin Team.\u201d Mr. Ovechkin is too recognizable, one official noted, to effectively traffic in proper espionage.The Kremlin itself has cheered Mr. Ovechkin\u2019s decision conspicuously, reminding the public that he is \u201ca very famous Russian, a successful Russian.\u201d\u201cWe know that he holds our president in high regard,\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters this month.Evgeny Minchenko, a top political consultant in Russia with close Kremlin connections, said the group could help combat \u201ca mythology that Putin is in fact not popular and that his rating is inflated.\u201dMr. Minchenko added that the support of figures like Mr. Ovechkin could coax \u201capolitical youth\u201d to the polls.But the \u201cPutin Team\u201d effort has added a James-Bond-level plot flourish to a political moment teeming with them: a local celebrity \u2014 subsisting in an era when once-outlandish notions of Russian dark arts have proved credible \u2014 making good on his status as the American resident Mr. Putin might well value most, excepting the one in the White House.Well?He smiled and said nothing.For American fans, Mr. Ovechkin\u2019s embrace of Mr. Putin has already proved uncomfortable, forcing some to reconcile their idol\u2019s support for a government seen as hostile to national interests with Mr. Ovechkin\u2019s image as an affable regional man-child.\u201cHe came in with all his teeth,\u201d began one story from Aaron McGovern, an owner of the lounge, recalling a particularly rowdy evening. Mr. Ovechkin, he said, had popped out a filler tooth and left it in a white hooded sweatshirt that was later stolen.As a rookie in 2005, knowing little English, Mr. Ovechkin greeted Capitals staff members, one by one, with a single phrase he had memorized and only vaguely understood: \u201cHi, I\u2019m Alex. I\u2019m so happy. Hi, I\u2019m Alex. I\u2019m so happy.\u201dInside the Capitals arena, his No. 8 jersey fills the stands.\u201cIf he could beat the Penguins, I\u2019d give him a pretty long leash,\u201d said George Schick, an Ovechkin fan and Putin critic, wearing the player\u2019s uniform during a recent game.He paused for a moment. \u201cCrushing the dissidents in Russia is pretty not cool,\u201d Mr. Schick allowed.In July, he acquired the matrimonial tea set from Mr. Putin, which he said he had not yet found the time to use.The president\u2019s bond with Mr. Ovechkin has not been lost on less famous Russian hockey players.\u201cHe never called me like Ovi,\u201d Evgeni Malkin, a standout for the Pittsburgh Penguins, said of Mr. Putin this month after a loss to Mr. Ovechkin\u2019s Capitals. \u201cHe\u2019s too busy to call to me.\u201dFriends have described Mr. Ovechkin as a politically oblivious figure with uncomplicated tastes and ambitions, gravitating toward borscht, video games and a meticulous training regimen. He could not be bothered, they suggested, with geopolitical scheming.\u201cHe\u2019s still a big kid,\u201d said Pete Kalamoutsos, a club owner who has known Mr. Ovechkin since his rookie season.In the interview, Mr. Ovechkin made a version of this argument himself. Hockey players, he said, have little instinct for politics.\u201cWe\u2019re not that smart,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just stay away from that and just do our job.\u201dHe also suggested that his contact with Mr. Putin should not be overstated, estimating that they had not spoken since the summer and clarifying that he did not have a cellphone number for the president. \u201cIt would be nice, though,\u201d he added.Such explanations, fans said, have become more difficult to accept.Mr. Oland\u2019s site takes its name from a quotation uttered by Mr. Ovechkin in 2006, after his rapid recovery from an injury:\u201cRussian machine never breaks.\u201dSophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting from Moscow, and Matthew Rosenberg from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Sells \u2018Rocket Fuel\u2019 Tax Plan as Economy Strengthens", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. CHARLES, Mo. \u2014 President Trump rallied support on Wednesday for his tax plan in a Missouri county where the unemployment rate is 2.7 percent, a fitting backdrop for a speech in which he bragged about the health of the economy while contending that a major tax cut was crucial to economic growth.Republicans have juggled those twin claims in pitching their tax bill, which was introduced at the beginning of November and remains on course to reach Mr. Trump\u2019s desk next month. They insist that the plan will deliver an immediate stimulus and encourage long-term investment.\u201cThese massive tax cuts will be rocket fuel\u201d for the American economy, particularly for small businesses on Main Street, Mr. Trump said in a speech here.But some economists question whether rocket fuel is needed at this point in the economic recovery and say that too much stimulus could ultimately backfire.The economy is strengthening and unemployment is at its lowest point in 16 years. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the economy had expanded at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, above the maximum sustainable level of output estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.Mr. Trump played up that report in a long riff, saying that the growth rate would have been \u201c4 percent, maybe over 4 percent\u201d if not for late summer hurricanes. \u201cWe are hitting numbers that nobody thought possible, certainly not in this time\u201d in office, he said, adding, \u201cThis is all done without the tax cuts.\u201dThe entire developed world is enjoying a simultaneous economic expansion for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, and the Fed and other economic forecasters see few obstacles to continued growth on the horizon.\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of tax stimulus at the current time because the economy doesn\u2019t really need it,\u201d William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said on Monday.The dispute about the economic effect of the tax plan is playing out at high speed because Republicans are rushing to pass the plan without the rounds of hearings and competing economic analyses that have shaped past efforts to substantially overhaul the federal tax code.Cutting taxes is likely to bolster short-term economic growth by encouraging more spending. But officials at the Federal Reserve have warned that the American economy is already growing around the maximum sustainable pace, meaning that faster growth is likely to cause higher inflation. The Fed could seek to dampen that effect by moving to raise interest rates more quickly.\u201cEconomic growth appears to have stepped up from its subdued pace early in the year,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, told Congress\u2019s Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday.\u201cWe welcome strong growth,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re worried about trends that could push inflation above our 2 percent objective.\u201dThose concerns are shared by independent economists. Inflation has remained sluggish since the financial crisis; this is the sixth straight year that inflation is likely to run below 2 percent. But some economists see evidence that the pace of price increases is already strengthening.Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation was already rising fast in metropolitan areas with low unemployment. Mr. Shepherdson has revised his forecasts upward for next year, in part because of accelerating business investment. That, in addition to a tax cut, would be \u201clike a double boost for an economy that doesn\u2019t need a single boost,\u201d he said.Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, said Monday that the Fed might need to raise interest rates more quickly even if growth did not accelerate. Some economists argue larger federal deficits can increase inflation. If tax cuts did increase inflation, or increased expectations of inflation, Mr. Evans said he would favor raising interest rates more quickly in response.Proponents of the tax plan contend that it will also increase the nation\u2019s economic capacity. They say that cutting corporate taxes, in particular, will encourage more investment. That will raise productivity, resulting in faster economic growth without increased inflation.The direct benefits of the tax cuts would mostly accrue to the wealthiest Americans, but Republicans say that increased investment will ultimately raise wages, too. Wage growth has remained sluggish in recent years even as the unemployment rate has declined.Some economic forecasters have increased their estimates for economic growth next year, both as a result of underlying improvement in the economy and in anticipation of a significant tax cut.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said it expected the American economy to grow 2.5 percent next year, up from a forecast of 2.4 percent six months ago.The potential pace of economic growth \u2014 the effective speed limit for the American economy \u2014 is determined by two factors: the expansion of the work force and the productivity of the average worker. Both have grown slowly in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue.The slower growth of the work force reflects the aging of the population as the baby boom generation moves into retirement. The youngest members of that generation will be 62 by 2026. It also reflects the reduced volume of immigration. The number of people moving to the United States has declined in recent years, and the Trump administration is working to further reduce the volume of both legal and illegal immigration to the United States.The reasons for the slow growth of productivity are less clear.And the problem is becoming worse. Productivity last year fell 0.2 percent.Some Republicans, including Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, contend that economic growth is already increasing partly in anticipation of a tax cut, and that failing to pass legislation would send stocks tumbling and curtail growth.It is a matter of basic logic that lower taxes should encourage corporate investment by increasing the profitability of those investments. But studies generally find the benefits are modest, and corporate executives often discount the importance of tax rates in their decision-making.When Gary D. Cohn, President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, recently asked a gathering of chief executives to raise their hands if the proposed tax cuts would affect their investment plans, only a few raised their hands. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the other hands up?\u201d Mr. Cohn asked.Another question is whether higher interest rates might offset the benefits of a tax cut. Critics of the Republican plan argue it would increase the federal debt, which would drive up rates as the government competes with private borrowers for the money it needs to fund its operations.Proponents of the plan argue that those effects are greatly overstated. They say that the government will be able to borrow the money it needs in global markets without driving up rates.Jim Tankersley reported from St. Charles, Mo., and Binyamin Appelbaum from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuelan Debt Now Has the Vultures Circling", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, investing in Venezuelan bonds has been a popular play for the world\u2019s largest investors \u2014 seduced by mouthwatering interest rates, despite the obvious risks.Now, as the bonds have plunged in value over fears that the Venezuelan government will finally default on its bond payments, many traditional investors are heading for the exits, replaced by a hardier band of funds that specialize in the debts of near-bankrupt nations.With steel stomachs and having survived numerous byzantine debt dramas \u2014 from Argentina in 2000 to Greece in 2012 \u2014 they see Venezuela as the next great debt-restructuring payday.Investors taking the long view still believe that the government will find a way to keep paying what it owes.Their calculation, Mr. Buchheit said, is simple: whether the price of the bonds is below what might be recovered through a debt-restructuring agreement or as part of legal enforcement if Venezuela refuses to negotiate.According to the data-gathering firm FactSet, established firms like Goldman Sachs, Fidelity and T. Rowe Price still sit on about $3.5 billion worth of bonds issued by the national oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa.By far, these have been the favorite bonds for foreign investors because the company is seen as the country\u2019s cash cow, with its steady stream of foreign-exchange earnings and its wealth of overseas assets.And so the selling has begun.\u201cWe have significantly reduced our portfolio in Venezuela over the past year,\u201d said Jan Dehn, the head of research at Ashmore Investment Management, an emerging-market specialist based in London. \u201cThis is a slow-moving train wreck.\u201dFor these experts in distress, or vulture investors, it is at this point that they get serious about committing funds. And those who have been through many such situations say Venezuela could become the most profitable of all.That is because many debt disasters occur in small countries in Africa and Latin America with limits on the bonds one can accumulate. And in larger countries like Argentina and Greece, profits were hard to come by as nations drove hard bargains.Venezuela is a special case for several reasons, debt experts say.Because of sanctions, it has been unable to hire a team of top bankers and lawyers who might help reach a favorable agreement with creditors. The haphazard nature of the government\u2019s tactics was revealed this week when a ballyhooed session with bond investors in the capital, Caracas, produced few attendees and no results.Unusually, the government has asked bondholders to come up with a plan for restructuring the debt. In most cases when a sovereign nation runs out of cash, a debt proposal is imposed on investors.Also, Venezuela\u2019s oil company has lucrative assets in the United States and Europe that holdout investors could try to seize through a lawsuit in a foreign court if the country stopped paying.Debt financiers also point out that for all its troubles, Venezuela is rich in resources, with the largest proven oil reserves in the world. Many billions of dollars have fled the country but could come back quickly if there was a change in government.While other investors have been selling, Hans Humes, the founder and chief executive of Greylock Capital, a fund that specializes in distressed debt, is looking to add to his positions.Since it has been just two weeks since Mr. Maduro said he would renegotiate Venezuela\u2019s debt, a vanguard of dedicated vulture funds has not yet formed, bankers say.But there is little doubt they are circling.\u201cOver the next five years, Venezuela will be the best emerging-market story out there \u2014 this is a fabulously wealthy country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about mean reversion. We are not looking for Venezuela to become a Switzerland. It just has to stop being Zimbabwe.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Deal-Maker Goes to China", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWith few successes under his belt on the domestic front, President Trump has gone to Asia this week hungry to negotiate deals. In Beijing, he will meet his match in President Xi Jinping, another bold and pugnacious nationalist who emerged last month from a Communist Party Congress with more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong.Chinese-American relations are increasingly fraught, and with so much power concentrated in Mr. Xi\u2019s hands, the only way to forge a better relationship is through a personal connection at the top, which makes the summit meeting later this week so important.Mr. Xi will not be easily pressured into compromise on Mr. Trump\u2019s terms on any of the pressing bilateral issues like North Korea and trade. And Mr. Trump, who has bluntly criticized China and has also praised Mr. Xi, has not yet shown the kind of long-term strategic thinking that this relationship demands. Thus, a grand agreement on this trip is unlikely. But Mr. Trump could save the meeting by agreeing with Mr. Xi to establish a formal way to work on Chinese-American relations over time.There are many obstacles to building stronger ties. An increasingly expansionist Beijing has declared the South China Sea a sovereign \u201ccore interest\u201d and has clashed with Tokyo over an island in the East China Sea. The Chinese leadership has quashed hopes for democratic governance in Hong Kong, a self-governing Chinese territory, and bullied South Korea for hosting a missile-defense system supplied by the United States. China defends protectionist trade and investment policies that are unfair to American businesses.On the American side, Mr. Trump has added to tensions by bluntly criticizing China for its trade practices and for failing to rein in Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. He has tweeted that China under Mr. Xi is \u201ctaking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the U.S.\u201dBut Mr. Trump has also shown characteristic inconsistency about China by praising Mr. Xi, calling him \u201ca powerful man\u201d and \u201ca very good person,\u201d adding admiringly that some now even think of him as \u201cthe king of China.\u201d This unpredictability could play to Mr. Trump\u2019s advantage, allowing him to remain a mysterious negotiator: The Chinese could rightly assume anything might be on the table this week.The North Korean nuclear threat is at the top of the agenda. Beijing has come a long way in recent years in recognizing the danger from Pyongyang, even supporting progressively tougher sanctions at the United Nations. But Mr. Xi still resists totally abandoning this old \u201cfraternal\u201d ally \u2014 once said to be as \u201cclose as lips and teeth.\u201dPrivate talks between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump could clarify what Beijing would expect if the North Korean regime were to collapse. Beijing would argue for the removal of the United States missile-defense system in South Korea, for a ban on American troops north of the demilitarized zone and ultimately a possible withdrawal of United States forces from South Korea.When it comes to trade and investment, the two countries also have common interests that urgently need readjusting. American patronage has afforded China many special dispensations that have helped its economy boom over the past three decades. But now that China has had such success, it\u2019s time to level the playing field.Mr. Trump should press China to end practices like requiring that proprietary American technology be transferred to Chinese companies as a condition of doing business in the country, rampant theft of intellectual property and the refusal to let American companies into major sectors of the Chinese economy (like telecommunications, media and banking). Beijing must take action on these fronts to build trust with Washington and establish a more reciprocal relationship.At the very least, whether Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi make progress on North Korea or these economic issues, the two leaders should agree to form a high-level working group, led on each side by someone trusted by each president, to take a defined time period of several months to agree on a specific \u201croad map\u201d of possibilities for more collaboration.At the end of the group\u2019s allotted time, the two presidents could meet at a relaxed venue to adopt the group\u2019s recommendations. Such a forward-looking plan would make the summit meeting a success.If a working group convened and eventually failed, the United States would at least know that closer cooperation in the Xi-Trump era was unlikely. This would position Washington to take a harder line against Beijing and justify moves like increased freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea; more military support for South Korea, Japan and Taiwan; building closer military alliances with countries like Vietnam, Singapore, Australia and India; and putting greater controls on Chinese investments in the United States.Mr. Trump, with his penchant for deal-making and his relatively weak political position, may be tempted to accept whatever he can get in Beijing for the sake of appearances. He could easily end up becoming a mere prop used to enhance Mr. Xi\u2019s stature, and getting little in return.But Mr. Trump must remember that just as Beijing has nonnegotiable \u201ccore interests,\u201d so does the United States. It would be fatal to trade any of them \u2014 commitments to allies, freedom of navigation through international waters, democratic principles \u2014 even for promises of cooperation on North Korea.Orville Schell is the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at Asia Society.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brooklyn\u2019s Haitians Wonder What Awaits Them When Protections End", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the heart of Flatbush, Brooklyn, past the bright Haitian takeout corner spot, with its aroma of richly fried pork, and down the block from La Difference driving school, an anxious crowd packed the front waiting room of the district office for Councilman Mathieu Eugene.Older residents of Brooklyn and recent immigrants from Haiti all wanted to know: What now?On Monday night, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it would \u2014 in 18 months \u2014 end a program known as Temporary Protected Status for Haitians affected by the deadly earthquake that rocked the island in 2010.T.P.S., as it is known, allows people from countries crippled by natural disasters or armed conflicts to live and work legally in the United States. By its nature, T.P.S. is supposed to end at some point, but under previous administrations its protections had been extended for years or even decades. The status of T.P.S. permit holders from Honduras and El Salvador has not yet been decided, but Homeland Security deemed Haiti ready to accept its citizens, and gave Haitians living in the U.S. until July 2019 to prepare.\u201cI went to Haiti last year and I can tell you, it\u2019s not ready,\u201d Peddy Jean-Louis, 50, said while waiting for an appointment to check on his status. \u201cIt is still damaged.\u201dWith a T.P.S. work permit, Mr. Jean-Louis has a job as a cook. He hoped his daughter, an American citizen, would be able to sponsor him for a green card. \u201cI am lucky, I have an option.\u201dThe others chatting somberly in French and Creole beside him were not as hopeful. But they brightened briefly when their Haitian-born City Council member, Dr. Eugene, burst through the storefront door and started shaking hands.A few minutes later, in his back conference room, Dr. Eugene, a Democrat who has been on the Council since 2007, confided that he, too, was worried.\u201cThese 18 months are going to be 18 months of panic, of stress, and that will create a mental situation,\u201d Dr. Eugene, who trained as a medical doctor, said. \u201cThis is going to create another disaster. We are going to break families apart.\u201dDr. Eugene also said the 18 months gave advocates more time to organize, perhaps for a more permanent status. \u201cIf they are still here, we are going to continue to fight,\u201d he said.There are approximately 5,200 Haitians living with T.P.S. in the city, according to the New York Immigration Coalition, an advocacy organization, and about 59,000 living in the United States since the earthquake. For some Haitians who had entered the country illegally or overstayed visas, T.P.S. allowed them an opportunity to live and work openly.Kane Andr\u00e9, a naturalized citizen from Haiti who is a church minister and a real estate agent, was looking on the bright side. \u201cWe were happy to have the permit extended,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I see is that if they plan to have more jobs, that would be good for the country. We fought here to get a better Haiti and so it will be easier to go back.\u201dBut, still, community leaders and those in small businesses wondered if such an eventual departure would have a ripple effect on Flatbush, if not the wider New York economy.The manager of the driving school, Ernst Severe, feared the empty room would be a sign of things to come. Immigrants from Haiti who had gotten T.P.S. after the earthquake represented about a third of his clients. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to affect my business greatly,\u201d Mr. Severe, 61, said before starting a driving lesson.At a money transfer station located in a nearby barbershop, Manoucheka Ostane, 35, said a good portion of the business comes from remittances immigrants send back to their families in Haiti.\u201cIf you don\u2019t send anything, you\u2019re not going to get anything,\u201d she said, referring to a commission. \u201cIf there\u2019s nobody coming in, we\u2019re going to have to close and look for something else to do.\u201dAs much as Haiti\u2019s still-struggling infrastructure dominated conversation in Brooklyn, Joenald Pierre wondered who was left on the island to welcome the earthquake refugees. An American citizen born to Haitian parents in New York, he was personally devastated by the disaster.\u201cWhere do you go?\u201d said Mr. Pierre, 44, while eating griot, a Haitian pork dish, at Bebe Fritay. \u201cWhere do you go? I lost half my family in the earthquake. Twenty cousins died.\u201dZachary Laresche, 52, opened Casa 1 Tire Repair in Flatbush in 2013, after he got a T.P.S. permit.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for a businessman like me to go back,\u201d he said, explaining that the island\u2019s economy would not support a small business. He figured that many people would defy orders of deportation to stay in the United States.But Mr. Laresche said he would decide his future when the time came.\u201cI\u2019m a citizen of the world,\u201d he said.On Tuesday, Dr. Eugene met in his office with a Haitian-Canadian member of Parliament, Emmanuel Dubourg. Dr. Eugene visited Montreal several months ago and was shocked to see the thousands of Haitians who had migrated there, supported by family, but with a tenuous hope for legal status.The two men wanted to dissuade Haitians from illegally crossing into Canada.\u201cThe message remains the same: It\u2019s not a free ticket to come to Canada,\u201d Mr. Dubourg said in an interview. Since the summer, he has been serving on a government task force addressing illegal immigration. According to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, a government agency, from January to September 6,360 Haitians applied for asylum, but only 10 percent received it.For those who don\u2019t have a valid asylum claim, Canada will send them back to their country of origin, Mr. Dubourg said.\u201cWe welcome them with dignity,\u201d he said.

We are being told of all the increased benefits and tax reductions coming our way, but this bill has been conjured up in the darkness of congressional meetings without observers, instead of in the light of day, with openness and transparency.The rush to passage in order to give President Trump his Christmas present and bragging rights of having finally achieved something significant in his first year in office is nothing short of a disgrace and a slap in the face to a gullible public.To the Editor:David Leonhardt states that removing the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act will cause premiums to increase because we need healthy people to help pay the bills of sicker people. Since healthy people will eventually get sick, removing the mandate creates a far more important problem.As long as insurance companies are required to cover people with pre-existing conditions at the same rates as their neighbors, it is both morally reprehensible and fiscally irresponsible to allow people to buy health insurance after they become sick. You cannot wait until your house burns down to buy fire insurance coverage, and you cannot wait until you have an accident to get auto insurance.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Mixed Messages Fail to Reassure Asian Allies", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANILA \u2014 President Trump vowed this week to reclaim America\u2019s role as a Pacific power. But as he wrapped up a marathon tour of Asia on Tuesday, Mr. Trump\u2019s mixed messages left allies unsure of America\u2019s staying power and fed a growing sense that China, not the United States, drives the agenda in the region.In Manila, the final stop on his punishing 12-day tour of the region, Mr. Trump declared his visit a success.\u201cThis has been a very fruitful trip for us and, also, in all fairness, for a lot of other nations,\u201d Mr. Trump said here on Monday, at a meeting with the leaders of Japan and Australia, during which he lectured them on the need for \u201cfair and reciprocal\u201d trade with the United States.\u201cIt was red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever received,\u201d the president added.By some measures, he was right. Mr. Trump made no major gaffes, his energy did not flag and he was accorded a lavish reception at every stop, especially Beijing, where President Xi Jinping threw open the doors of the Forbidden City.\u201cLike any Trump endeavor, there were the inevitable distractions with tweets about the physical appearance of leaders and clear signals that he prefers the company of tyrants like Putin and Duterte,\u201d said Kurt M. Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs.Still, Mr. Campbell said, \u201cIf this trip were a high-wire act, President Trump managed to get to the other side.\u201dAnd yet there were subtler signs of tension, which spoke to the conflicting messages Mr. Trump brought to Asia and suggested a level of disarray in White House policy toward the region.Before his meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia, for example, Mr. Trump had a brief contretemps with Mr. Turnbull over trade imbalances after he asserted that the United States ran deficits with \u201calmost everybody.\u201d\u201cExcept us,\u201d Mr. Turnbull interjected.Mr. Trump made trade a major part of his message in Asia, and his tone grew more bluntly nationalistic as the trip wore on. After declaring in Beijing that he did not blame the Chinese for chronic imbalances with the United States, he delivered a withering denunciation in Vietnam of regional trade pacts, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which Mr. Trump has withdrawn the United States.The president delivered that message in a speech that was supposed to explain his concept of a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific\u201d region. The idea, which Trump officials borrowed from the Japanese, is that the region\u2019s four major maritime democracies \u2014 the United States, Japan, Australia and India \u2014 will constitute a bulwark against a rising China.But this theme was largely lost in the jeremiad on trade. Critics said it testified to the divide within the administration between mainstream foreign policy figures like Matthew Pottinger, the senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, and economic nationalists like the policy adviser Stephen Miller, who took a strong hand in writing the speech.\u201cThe Indo-Pacific framing is clearly the handiwork of his more experienced and internationally-minded senior national security team, while the \u2018America First\u2019 theme of demanding zero-sum concessions from all our trading partners is not,\u201d said Michael J. Green, senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Mr. Trump\u2019s invitation for one-on-one trade negotiations with the United States, Mr. Green said, was likely to fall on deaf ears in Asian countries, many of which went though fierce debates before signing on to the Pacific trade deal and now want to reap its benefits.\u201cThat\u2019s like a sheriff squaring up for a showdown with the town outlaw by announcing to the posse that he wants a gunfight with each of them at the same time,\u201d said Mr. Green, who served as President George W. Bush\u2019s senior adviser on Asia policy.\u201cI think this will be a strong message for not only Asia, but also other regions in the world,\u201d Japan\u2019s economy minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, told reporters.\u201cHe\u2019s a strong person,\u201d Mr. Trump said to reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s a very smart person. I like him a lot; he likes me. But, you know, we represent two very different countries. But we get along very well. And that\u2019s a good thing that we get along; that\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201dWhite House officials said Mr. Trump\u2019s charm offensive had paid off in extracting new commitments from China to shut down North Korean bank accounts. But officials acknowledged that China had not budged on their No. 1 request on North Korea: to cut off all shipments of oil to the North.Nor did it announce major moves to open its markets during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit, in part because the president did not ask for any.Moreover, Mr. Trump soft-pedaled his call for China not to colonize the South China Sea. While he emphasized the need for free navigation and open shipping lanes during his visits to Vietnam and the Philippines, he did not single out China until the last speech of his trip when he said, \u201cI remain concerned about China\u2019s efforts to build and militarize outposts in the South China Sea.\u201dDuring his meeting with Vietnam\u2019s president, Tran Dai Quang, Mr. Trump offered his deal-making skills to mediate disputes in the South China Sea. But some Asian countries are no longer as ready to pick fights with China. Mr. Duterte stopped construction last week on a sandbar in disputed waters, as part of a broader effort to draw closer to Beijing.Just before leaving Manila on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters he had repaired what he claimed had been a \u201chorrible\u201d relationship between Mr. Duterte and the United States. \u201cWe have a very good relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cI would actually say, probably better than ever before.\u201dAfter 12 hectic days in Asia, even Mr. Trump\u2019s critics acknowledge he projected an air of engagement. The question, they said, is whether his mixed messages will open the door further for China\u2019s incursions in the region.\u201cDespite all the craziness of Trump, the U.S. remains in the game in Asia,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a former adviser to President Barack Obama on China. \u201cBut the U.S. is no longer driving the agenda.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the \u2018Diversity Lottery\u2019 Needs to End", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAlmost immediately after the Manhattan terrorist attack on Tuesday, President Trump faulted the \u201cdiversity lottery\u201d visa program under which the Uzbek immigrant suspected in the attack entered this country, and laid the blame for the program\u2019s existence on Senator Charles Schumer and other Democrats.As is often the case, he is wrong on his facts \u2014 here, about political responsibility for the program, which has been supported by both parties for over 25 years (though Mr. Schumer has backed getting rid of it). But Mr. Trump is right that these visas are bad policy and that the program should be canceled. Better still, they should be used for other, wiser purposes.First, the facts. Of the roughly one million permanent resident visas \u2014 commonly known as green cards \u2014 issued each year, 50,000 are awarded through a lottery process with few preconditions other than that applicants come from countries with little immigration to the United States during the previous five years.Congress made this program permanent in 1990 after several years of experimentation. Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Representative Bruce Morrison of Connecticut, both Democrats, invoked a \u201cdiversity\u201d rationale in noting that the program would help the many Irish in the United States who had overstayed their temporary visas. Despite the numerous people of Irish background already in the country from earlier waves of migration, Ireland was an eligible country under the program because, at the time, its economy was doing well and few people were emigrating. So much for actual diversity.Today, lottery winners with little education, job skills, English fluency and work experience can hit the jackpot and promptly come (or stay) here permanently, while millions of American citizens and legal residents must wait years for their family members to be allowed to join them, dividing families and motivating illegal immigration. (Even citizens must now wait for sometimes 20 years for their unmarried children to get a visa.) The same challenge faces would-be immigrants who have skills needed here but can\u2019t qualify for an employer-sponsored visa. Even the State Department, which runs the lottery program, acknowledges that it is rife with fraud.If you find this lottery a weird way to allocate 5 percent of our one million precious green cards, you\u2019re right. It makes no sense for the United States to randomly distribute these visas on the fictitious argument that the most diverse advanced nation in the world needs more diversity in its immigrant population. None of the few other countries that routinely admit immigrants uses a lottery.True, America has probably benefited from some of the immigrants who have come through the program. But that\u2019s to be expected: Since more than one million lottery winners have arrived since 1990, it is a statistical certainty that some would flourish here. But there is no reason to believe that lottery winners in general will do as well here as other immigrants who must demonstrate their skills, job offers or family ties to be admitted.Still, there are much better uses for these coveted visas. The simplest reform would allocate them to some or all of the existing legal admission categories. Another approach, already proposed by some in Congress, would move to a Canadian-type point system, which allocates visas competitively based on various criteria such as existing ties to the country, English fluency, formal education and job skills.Another reform, long proposed by pro-immigration economists, would auction some visas among applicants who meet certain requirements. Auctioning the 50,000 lottery visas \u2014 perhaps adding in the 10,000 or so visas a year awarded under the fraud-prone EB-5 investor program \u2014 could be used to attract bids by skilled workers and their potential employers, yielding revenues that can be put to good social use.Green cards to the United States are among the most valuable pieces of paper on earth, especially today when we are one of the few remaining beacons of hope, opportunity and safety for would-be immigrants. We should distribute them in our considered national interest, not by chance.Peter H. Schuck is an emeritus law professor at Yale and the author, most recently, of \u201cOne Nation Undecided: Clear Thinking About Five Hard Issues That Divide Us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Aiming to Coax Xi Jinping, Bets on Flattery", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 President Trump heaped praise on President Xi Jinping of China on Thursday, blaming past American administrations for China\u2019s yawning trade surplus with the United States and saying he was confident that Mr. Xi could defuse the threat from North Korea.In public, Mr. Trump projected an air of deference to China that was almost unheard-of for a visiting American president. Far from attacking Mr. Xi on trade, Mr. Trump saluted him for leading a country that he said had left the United States \u201cso far behind.\u201d He said he could not blame the Chinese for taking advantage of weak American trade policy.Behind closed doors, American officials insisted, Mr. Trump forcefully confronted Mr. Xi about the chronic trade imbalances between the two countries. He also pressed China to take tougher measures toward North Korea, including a suspension of oil shipments.In neither case did the Chinese make significant concessions, nor did Mr. Trump express dissatisfaction with their response.It was a remarkable moment in the story of China\u2019s rise and America\u2019s response to it, with Mr. Trump\u2019s performance suggesting a tipping point in great-power politics. By concluding that the United States can better achieve its goals by flattering a Chinese leader than by challenging him, Mr. Trump seemed to signal a reversal of roles: the United States may now need China\u2019s help more than the other way around.\u201cYou\u2019re a very special man,\u201d he told Mr. Xi in an appearance before reporters, at which they did not take questions.Mr. Xi, for his part, did not return Mr. Trump\u2019s fulsome personal praise, seeming to treat him like any other American leader.\u201cI told the president that the Pacific is big enough to accommodate both China and the United States,\u201d Mr. Xi said, after reciting his well-worn line that the two countries could peacefully coexist if they respected each other\u2019s different political systems.Trump administration officials said that the leaders\u2019 exchanges had had a harder edge behind the scenes. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters that Mr. Trump had, in effect, used flattery to appeal to Mr. Xi to do more to isolate North Korea.\u201cOur president has been very clear with President Xi that he takes the view that, \u2018You are a very powerful neighbor of theirs, you account for 90-plus percent of their economic activity, you\u2019re a strong man,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tillerson said, channeling Mr. Trump. \u201c\u2018You can, I\u2019m sure, solve this for me.\u2019\u201dMr. Tillerson dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s contention that trade deficits were America\u2019s fault as \u201ca little bit of tongue in cheek\u201d in the midst of a much tougher discussion. During their meeting, he said, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, ticked off the long history of trade imbalances, and warned they could not be allowed to continue.The one tangible gain from Mr. Trump\u2019s trip \u2014 $250 billion worth of business agreements between American and Chinese companies \u2014 was viewed as a token of Chinese good will. Many of the deals are preliminary and will take years to come to fruition. They broke no new ground in areas, like technology, where the United States is losing market access.Mr. Tillerson himself played down the significance of any progress that was made in trade talks. \u201cQuite frankly, in the grand scheme of a three-to-five hundred billion-dollar trade deficit, the things that have been achieved thus far are pretty small,\u201d he said.President Xi Jinping is using tried-and-true methods to craft a personality cult reminiscent of Mao.Still, Chinese analysts said the deals underscored Mr. Xi\u2019s desire to give Mr. Trump a victory. \u201cO.K. relations with Trump\u2019s America is very important for both Xi\u2019s glory and his strategy,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University.To many Chinese, Mr. Trump came to Beijing as a kind of supplicant, needing help on critical issues. \u201cIt is no longer possible for an American president to come to China and tell China to do this or that,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.In 2009, President Barack Obama paid his first visit to China at a time when the United States was reeling from the financial crisis and the Chinese economy was ascendant. As with Mr. Trump, the Chinese authorities did not allow questions during his appearance with then-President Hu Jintao. State television did not broadcast a town-hall meeting that Mr. Obama held with students.On later visits, however, Mr. Obama made headway with China on issues like climate change. Like his predecessors, he regularly raised human rights concerns. In 2014, the White House persuaded the Chinese to allow questions during his news conference with Mr. Xi, which was viewed at the time as a major symbolic victory for Mr. Obama.Trump administration officials blamed the Chinese for the refusal to take questions on Thursday, but it was not clear whether they had pressed the issue. Nor was it clear how energetically Mr. Trump had brought up human rights with Mr. Xi, even in private. He said nothing about the issue in public, beyond a general commitment to individual rights and the rule of law.His failure to draw attention to human rights \u201cwill have a demonstrable negative impact on the lives of dissidents in China,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Asia. \u201cExternal pressure is the only reason Chinese government treats dissidents better.\u201dOn North Korea, the leaders\u2019 meeting brought similarly mixed results. Mr. Trump, officials said, asked Mr. Xi to cut off oil shipments, to shut down North Korean bank accounts, and to send home tens of thousands of North Koreans who work in China.North Korea has been striving to develop nuclear-tipped missiles that can hit the United States mainland. But Pyongyang has not conducted a missile test in nearly two months, which some analysts see as providing a diplomatic opening.In a sign that China was doing something, even incremental, to curb ties, some travel agencies in the border town of Dandong were told this week to curtail their tourist business in the North.North Korea has become a popular destination for Chinese travelers who want inexpensive foreign trips. Shutting down tours cuts off an avenue for Chinese currency for the North Korean regime, though hardly a major one.On Saturday, the United States signaled its resolve to put military pressure on North Korea, announcing that three aircraft carrier groups would carry out large-scale naval maneuvers in the Western Pacific. At the same time, Mr. Trump seemed to accept Mr. Xi\u2019s pleas for patience.\u201cPresident Xi took that view that the sanctions are going to take a little while, that he didn\u2019t expect immediate results,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cIn terms of how much stress it will create on them, time will tell.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that Mr. Xi could solve the crisis. \u201cIf he works on it hard, it will happen,\u201d he said at a meeting with business executives. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201dAt their joint appearance, Mr. Trump turned to the Chinese president and declared, \u201cA great responsibility has been placed on our shoulders. It is truly a great responsibility.\u201dHis observation captured the essential nature of the visit: a grand exercise in personal diplomacy between two strong-willed leaders, who seemed determined to get along. Mr. Xi arranged for Yao Ming, the Chinese basketball star, to attend a state dinner for Mr. Trump, held in a lavishly decorated room in the Great Hall of the People.Mr. Trump showed the Chinese leader a video \u2014 later played again at the state dinner, on a large screen \u2014 of his 6-year-old granddaughter, Arabella Kushner, singing a song and reciting Chinese poetry for Mr. Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan. Mr. Xi, according to state media, pronounced it an \u201cA+\u201d performance.An earlier version of this article misstated China\u2019s trade imbalance with the United States. China has a trade surplus, not a deficit.Advertisement"}

Would the U.S. Let Him Go?", "Date": "2017-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 Forty inmates lined up for the daily mail call at the Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution, a complex of low-slung brick buildings in the middle of New Jersey.It was July 2012, and one of the inmates was Philip Baker. A former hedge fund manager, he was serving a 20-year sentence for fraud. He had used bogus performance data to lure hundreds of people and institutions into his fund. His investors had lost hundreds of millions of dollars.Mr. Baker, 46 at the time, admitted that he had committed fraud. \u201cI\u2019m a criminal,\u201d he said recently. But he had convinced himself that he deserved to be free. And he was waiting for a letter that might turn his fantasy into reality.Months earlier, Mr. Baker, who is Canadian, had signed a plea agreement that included an unusual caveat: Prosecutors would not object to the Justice Department\u2019s transferring him to Canada to serve out his sentence.Such transfers were rare. But Mr. Baker knew that if he could persuade the Justice Department to give him one, Canada would probably parole him after he had served only a fraction of his prison term.Mr. Baker, a Baptist, prayed for God\u2019s guidance. \u201cOnly he could set my direction straight,\u201d he said during one in a series of interviews about his life and crimes.In the prison\u2019s television room, a guard dispensing the mail called out inmates\u2019 names and numbers.\u201cPhilip Baker, 22856-424.\u201dMr. Baker stepped forward. The guard handed him a thin envelope with a Justice Department return address. Assuming it was more paperwork, he tore it open \u2014 and could not believe what he saw.He started to tremble. He felt people staring at him.\u201cI felt like throwing up,\u201d he said.After the financial crisis last decade, the federal government was expected to aggressively pursue criminal cases against top financiers: the fund managers, bankers, mortgage lenders and Wall Street executives who helped cause the global economy to crater. But prosecutions have been rare. The exceptions have been obscure or relatively junior industry players against whom it was easy to build cases but who did not bear primary responsibility for the crisis.One reason: Prosecutors were under pressure to move quickly and to not lose trials. They preferred to take the safest, simplest routes to win convictions, and to then move on to new cases.That is what happened with Mr. Baker, who became a top target. The government labeled him a fugitive, made him the subject of an international manhunt and, eventually, extradited him from Germany, where he had been living with his wife.Mr. Baker was not a big fish; his hedge fund had under $1 billion in assets. And even when he was apprehended, a desire to resolve the case swiftly led a powerful United States attorney to insert the transfer-to-Canada clause into an otherwise airtight plea agreement.His experience highlights one of the primary critiques of the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to clean up Wall Street: Bankers nearly destroyed the global economy, but few went to jail.This account of Mr. Baker\u2019s long-shot effort to escape to Canada, which has not previously been reported, is based on interviews with him and his family, and with his lawyers, former colleagues and current and former government officials, as well as on thousands of pages of legal documents, internal emails and other records from Mr. Baker\u2019s defunct hedge fund.Philip Baker was raised in a middle-class family in Toronto. One of his earliest memories took place in the hospital. Born with a heart defect, he needed surgery when he was 7. When it was time for the procedure, his parents walked out of his hospital room.\u201cI thought they were abandoning me,\u201d he said. That fear stayed with him, fostering a desire to please his parents and other authority figures.As a boy, he showed an affinity for finance. While his friends played with toy soldiers, he toted a leather briefcase and pretended to be a stockbroker.But his early years in the financial industry were rocky. After dropping out of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., he eventually landed at the brokerage Refco. Colleagues remember an insecure man whose nickname was \u201cPhilipbuster,\u201d because of his tendency to talk endlessly.He married a woman from a wealthy Canadian family, heirs to the Hollinger media fortune. The couple had five children in Windsor, Ontario.\u201cI was always trying to impress that family,\u201d Mr. Baker said. Hoping to prove that he could succeed as an entrepreneur, he quit Refco to start his own hedge fund.The fund failed.Mr. Baker lied to his wife and in-laws that he had found a new job at a big Detroit bank. For several months, he put on a suit and pretended to cross the Detroit River and go to work.One day, he said, his wife tried to call him at the office. The bank told her that nobody named Philip Baker worked there.Mr. Baker recalls her words to him that evening, when he came home: \u201cGet out.\u201d The marriage was over. (She declined to be interviewed.)He holed up in a friend\u2019s basement. One morning, he grabbed a .22-caliber rifle and drove to a forest outside town. He called a former Refco colleague, John Kurgan, and said he was preparing to kill himself.\u201cSlow down a minute, cowboy,\u201d Mr. Kurgan responded. He told Mr. Baker he had a job prospect for him in Toronto. Then, noting that Mr. Baker had called in on a recorded Refco line, Mr. Kurgan jokingly asked if he could sell the audio of his suicide.Mr. Baker was infuriated by the comment. But it snapped him out of his suicidal stupor.What happened next set the stage for Mr. Baker\u2019s later downfall.According to Mr. Baker and to his plea agreement, he and Mr. Kurgan went into business together. They formed a new commodities-trading hedge fund, Lake Shore Asset Management. Mr. Baker lined up clients, and Mr. Kurgan did much of the trading.Mr. Kurgan was not charged with wrongdoing. In an interview, he declined to describe his role in the business. \u201cThis is something that happened many years ago,\u201d he said.Mr. Baker set up shop in another basement \u2014 this one in his parents\u2019 home, north of Toronto. He raised more than $10 million for the fund. A tiny sum in hedge-fund terms, but enough that Lake Shore was able to start trading in February 2002.The fund got off to a spectacularly bad start. That summer, a single futures trade lost 48 percent of the fund\u2019s assets. Mr. Baker blamed Mr. Kurgan for the bad trade.To hide the loss, Lake Shore concocted data that showed a stellar performance. Mr. Baker shared the bogus numbers with current and prospective clients. One marketing brochure cited annual returns of more than 30 percent. Another claimed falsely that the firm had a 14-year investing record.Mr. Kurgan, now working at Royal Bank of Canada, accused Mr. Baker of \u201ctrying to muddy my name\u201d and noted that \u201cthe justice system obviously found him guilty.\u201d Mr. Kurgan did not respond to detailed follow-up questions sent to him by email.Mr. Baker knew he was committing fraud. \u201cI failed to stand up for my clients,\u201d he said, adding that he did not want to betray Mr. Kurgan, whom he credited with preventing his suicide. \u201cI became too loyal.\u201dThe firm attracted hundreds of new clients. Royal Bank of Canada invested millions of dollars, as did EquiGenesis, a Toronto money manager specializing in tax-efficient investing and charitable giving. Lake Shore \u201ccreated an impression of credibility,\u201d said Kenneth M. Gordon, EquiGenesis\u2019s president.Lake Shore\u2019s staff grew to more than a dozen traders and salespeople. It opened offices in London and Geneva. Prominent finance executives, including Laurence Rosenberg, the former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, joined the board.Mr. Baker bought bespoke suits. He hired a butler. At a club in Hamburg, Germany, one night, he met Kristina Malychenko, a tall blonde from Kazakhstan. They started dating.Mr. Baker was earning millions \u2014 more than $7 million in the first half of 2007 alone, he said. He felt like he was proving himself. \u201cI chased pride and vanity,\u201d he said. He described himself as being \u201con the cusp of happiness.\u201dLake Shore wanted to enter the American market. It set up a website aimed at investors in United States.That turned out to be a crucial mistake. A self-regulatory organization, the National Futures Association, started scrutinizing Lake Shore. The group alerted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to what appeared to be suspicious claims on the website. The commission concluded that Lake Shore had been soliciting American clients without legal authorization.Mr. Kurgan began to distance himself from the fund. He emailed Mr. Baker: \u201cIf, through your kindness, you have listed me as either, director, partner or any other title with any of the Lake Shore entities please remove my name at once.\u201dAs investigators dug in, they realized the fund had been lying about its history and performance.The problems deepened in August 2007, when the cash-management firm holding Lake Shore\u2019s assets filed for bankruptcy. What little money the firm\u2019s clients had left was now stuck in an insolvent firm.\u201cI felt like Napoleon being attacked by all sides,\u201d Mr. Baker said.Lake Shore shipped many of its files and computer hard drives to Geneva. Mr. Baker\u2019s lawyer refused to hand over the materials to the Americans, citing Swiss bank-secrecy laws.\u201cWe invested money in good faith based on representations they made, and then the money vanished,\u201d Mr. Gordon of EquiGenesis said. \u201cIt was a disaster.\u201dThe commodities trading commission filed civil fraud charges against Mr. Baker and Lake Shore. A federal judge, persuaded that Mr. Baker was on the run and hiding evidence, referred the case to the local United States attorney\u2019s office for criminal investigation.F.B.I. agents interviewed Mr. Baker\u2019s Lake Shore colleagues. Mr. Kurgan told them that he had no formal role with Lake Shore and was only its outside broker, an F.B.I. summary of the interview shows.By the F.B.I.\u2019s tally, Lake Shore\u2019s roughly 700 clients had lost more than $300 million. Investigators believed that Mr. Baker and others at the firm had siphoned off at least $11 million for their personal use.In February 2009, a grand jury returned a sealed, 27-count indictment accusing Mr. Baker of fraud, embezzlement and obstruction of justice. His colleagues were not charged.That month, Mr. Baker married Ms. Malychenko in a civil ceremony in Hamburg, where the two were living. He said he did not know that he had been indicted, or even that he was a wanted man. With Lake Shore dead, he said, he was trying to focus on the future. \u201cGod had a different plan, and I moved on,\u201d he said.Within a few weeks \u2014 and just days after Mr. Baker and Ms. Malychenko celebrated their nuptials with a black-tie party at a Hamburg yacht club \u2014 a pair of plainclothes German police officers appeared at Mr. Baker\u2019s door. They escorted him to their car. His new wife blew him a kiss.Mr. Baker was held in a prison near the Hamburg airport. One day, an official from the Canadian Embassy came to visit with a brochure explaining Mr. Baker\u2019s rights as a Canadian citizen. One right he learned about: If he were convicted in the United States, he would be entitled under an international treaty to apply to be transferred to Canada to serve his sentence.\u201cThat\u2019s when I started thinking about how to pull this off,\u201d he said.In December 2009, after Mr. Baker had spent five months in a German jail, United States marshals flew him to Chicago, where he was booked into the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Months passed as he awaited a trial date, and Mr. Baker learned the prison\u2019s rhythms. The most important thing, he said, was to convince other inmates that he was not a child molester. He told them he was a Wall Street crook.Clifford C. Histed, the lead prosecutor on the case, summoned Mr. Baker to discuss the report. Mr. Baker argued that it proved he did not deserve to be punished alone. And he said the commodities trading commission was making Lake Shore a scapegoat, flexing its enforcement muscles after failing to prevent other hedge funds from blowing up.Mr. Histed told him to provide proof.Mr. Baker, using a computer in the prison library, spent months sifting through electronic documents before presenting his case to Mr. Histed.The prosecutor did not agree that Mr. Baker was the victim of a government conspiracy. But in Mr. Baker\u2019s final plea agreement, prosecutors said Mr. Baker did have a partner, described as \u201cIndividual A,\u201d who had misrepresented Lake Shore\u2019s returns and misappropriated money. \u201cIndividual A\u201d refers to Mr. Kurgan, according to a person involved in the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly about the plea document.Mr. Baker and his lawyer, Daniel L. Rashbaum, a former prosecutor, were running out of legal options. Then Mr. Baker remembered the Canadian treaty he had learned about in Germany.Starting in the late 1970s, the United States had entered into a series of treaties that established protocols for cross-border prisoner transfers. One catalyst was the nonfiction book \u201cMidnight Express,\u201d the basis of a 1978 movie, about a young American imprisoned in Turkey.That gave Mr. Rashbaum an idea. If he could get the United States attorney\u2019s office to support a transfer to Canada, perhaps Justice Department officials in Washington would go along with it. And the Canadians, Mr. Rashbaum recalled thinking, were likely to let Mr. Baker out quickly. In that case, the length of his sentence in America wouldn\u2019t matter.Mr. Rashbaum approached Mr. Histed with a proposal: Mr. Baker would admit guilt and accept a 20-year prison sentence, with no chance for parole, if the prosecutors did not object to him being transferred to Canada.Mr. Histed said in an interview that he knew the defense hoped the maneuver would result in Mr. Baker\u2019s freedom, but he doubted it would work. And more important, he knew that going to trial would be time-consuming and risky for the government, in part because Mr. Baker could raise questions in front of a jury about why he alone was on trial.So Mr. Histed agreed to the deal. \u201cWhat mattered to us was that he be brought to justice in the United States,\u201d he said in an interview.On Aug. 24, 2011, Mr. Baker was presented a plea agreement to sign. He was nervous; his lawyer was terrified. \u201cThe horror of pleading someone to 20 years based on a creative plan scared the living daylights out of me,\u201d Mr. Rashbaum said.Mr. Baker took a deep breath and signed the document. Mr. Rashbaum walked out to the parking lot and vomited.Before Mr. Baker left Chicago to begin serving his sentence, he received a bill from the Justice Department for $154,831,682.32 in restitution. \u201cWe strongly urge you to pay this debt immediately,\u201d the bill said. He also received divorce papers from his wife.Three months later, Mr. Baker stood in the mail-call line and opened the letter that would change his life. \u201cThe United States has approved the request for transfer to Canada of the above-named Canadian national,\u201d it read.Mr. Baker felt dizzy. He scanned the letter again to make sure he had not misread it. Then he walked back to his cell. \u201cI think God really stepped in,\u201d he said.He had been imprisoned for about three years \u2014 five months in Germany, two years in Chicago and seven months at Fort Dix \u2014 after being convicted of a single count of fraud. As a result, he would probably be eligible for parole in Canada.Mr. Histed, the prosecutor, said the speed of the decision surprised him. \u201cIf we knew he would immediately have been approved for a transfer, would that have changed our stance?\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps.\u201dMr. Baker\u2019s transfer to Canada still needed the approval of the authorities there.Vic Toews, the minister for public safety at that time, believed that such transfers posed public-safety risks. He wrote that, because he had lived in Germany, Mr. Baker intended \u201cto abandon Canada as his place of permanent residence.\u201d The application was rejected.\u201cI always thought the hitch would be with the U.S. government, not the Canadians,\u201d Mr. Baker said. He had convinced himself that freedom was imminent. Now he was marooned in New Jersey.Coming to terms with the prospect of spending years in prison, he started to teach yoga. He dispensed investing advice to guards. He got a landscaping job on the prison grounds. His monthly pay was $18, a few dollars of which were earmarked to pay down his $155 million debt.And he began writing about his experience. Not knowing how his tale would end, he finished with a fictional scene in which he was reunited with his father on the shore of a lake where he had sailed as a boy.Then, after Mr. Baker had spent nearly six years incarcerated in America, Canada elected a new government, and Mr. Baker sensed an opportunity. Perhaps the new administration would have a more positive attitude about prisoner transfers.He reapplied. And this time, it worked.On May 10, 2016, another letter arrived, this one from Ottawa. Canada\u2019s public safety minister, it said, \u201chas approved your transfer to Canada.\u201dLast fall, Mr. Baker rode a bus across the Canadian border to a minimum-security prison. He could cook for himself, and go fishing. Two months later, his case manager called him to ask: \u201cDo you want to go home?\u201dIt was his mother\u2019s birthday. The prison gave him a winter jacket and a bus ticket to Toronto. On the bus, Mr. Baker borrowed a passenger\u2019s cellphone and called his father.\u201cI\u2019m on a bus!\u201d he exclaimed.\u201cI started to cry,\u201d his father, William Baker, recalled.The elder Mr. Baker told his wife that he was taking her to dinner. The place, he said, was a surprise. Instead, he drove to a shopping mall northeast of Toronto. Their son was standing outside an Old Navy store.Mr. Baker\u2019s release was not announced. His former colleagues, his first wife, the Lake Shore clients who lost money \u2014 no one knew he was out.\u201cI\u2019m sorry he\u2019s out of jail, because that\u2019s where he belongs,\u201d said Mr. Rosenberg, the former Lake Shore director. \u201cHe screwed so many people.\u201dMr. Baker moved back into his parents\u2019 basement. He set up a small office with some accouterments \u2014 a golden pen case, a picture of a yacht \u2014 from his Lake Shore days. He interviewed for a job as a financial consultant. He contemplated turning his prison writings into a book.That was when he discovered he had miscalculated. In prison, he had imagined that if he got to Canada, the authorities in the United States would not pursue him for the $155 million he owed.But this summer, a lawyer whom he had consulted about a book deal broke the news: The receiver in the Lake Shore bankruptcy could chase him and any money he made, through Canada\u2019s civil courts.So Mr. Baker is free. But he has no prospect of escaping the shadow of his former life.\u201cI\u2019m screwed,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Building a Buzzy Hive of Invention and Collaboration", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 While pursuing a plan for student housing in this city\u2019s historic jewelry district, Brown University officials were sidetracked by discussions about what to do with a massive, century-old power station sitting vacant alongside the housing site on the Providence River.The housing developer, Richard A. Galvin, the president and chief executive of CV Properties in Boston, convinced them that the structure could be redeveloped into a property that would enhance Brown\u2019s other investments in the district, including its medical school. Lined with 30-foot arched windows, the brick building provided vast views of the river and the city beyond.Brown recruited the University of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College, which were jointly looking for a site to build a nursing school, and then helped negotiations with the state to secure a long-term lease agreement. Now, a public nursing school and the administrative staff of an Ivy League university are housed together in a refurbished power station at the edge of an emerging innovation and design district.Filling industrial-themed open work spaces completed last month, Brown\u2019s administrative offices are now all in one place instead of scattered around its main campus on College Hill. And the nursing school, close to both the medical school and two hospitals, is able to train students in state-of-the-art health care simulation labs, complete with high-tech mannequins so lifelike they can breathe, have seizures and even give birth.\u201cIt\u2019s an unusual partnership \u2014 a land-grant school like U.R.I. and an institution like Brown,\u201d said Russell Carey, Brown\u2019s executive vice president for planning and policy. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201dIt\u2019s the sort of collaboration that academic, business and government officials here hope to emulate and build on as they, like many other community leaders around the country, seek to promote a fledgling innovation district. Such networking, experts say, is a key component of the success of established innovation districts elsewhere in the country. Those already flourishing in cities such as Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Cambridge, Mass., are bustling hives of invention and collaboration, usually huddled around major research universities or tech companies, and often with dense infusions of retail, restaurants and housing.In his experience, the biggest hurdle for these districts is getting a network of public, private, civic, academic and entrepreneurial interests to act in unison. In general, he added, \u201cthis is not about the government.\u201d\u201cA lot of it is bottom up, and networked,\u201d he said.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to run out of steam anytime soon,\u201d Mr. Berke said. But, he added, \u201cwe have to pay attention to it so it doesn\u2019t wither.\u201dThe Providence district, which is designated by the city as a 125-acre riverfront swath, was largely born of the realignment of Interstate 195 out of the city core, freeing for development about 20 acres that intersect with the former jewelry manufacturing hub.\u201cThis neighborhood was once a fount of innovation \u2014 costume jewelry products were pioneered here,\u201d said Stefan Pryor, the state\u2019s secretary of commerce. \u201cWe are reawakening that innovative spirit.\u201dWexford Science & Technology, a Baltimore company that specializes in developing what it calls knowledge communities around major research universities, has become a major investor in the district. Wexford teamed up with CV Properties on the $220 million power station redevelopment, which includes student housing and a parking garage. (Ventas, a real estate investment trust and Wexford\u2019s capital partner, has since bought the power station.)And in September, Wexford broke ground on a 191,000-square-foot innovation center. The center will be anchored by Brown\u2019s School of Professional Studies; the Cambridge Innovation Center, a Boston-area company that leases space to start-ups; and a Johnson & Johnson health technology operation.Wexford secured about $41 million in state subsidies and tax credits for the $89 million project. The state also contributed the land, with the $4.5 million value to be returned over time, said Thomas Osha, Wexford\u2019s senior vice president of innovation and economic development. He said the subsidies would enable Wexford to provide some innovation and collaboration space at affordable rates.\u201cThe challenge is how to ensure you\u2019ve got a good mix of space at a variety of price points,\u201d he said.With Ventas, Wexford is involved with 12 innovation districts around the country. However, Mr. Osha said, \u201cat any one time, I am in advanced conversations with another half-dozen cities, and initial conversations with another six to 10.\u201d\u201cIt can be three-plus years from initial conversations to shovel in the ground,\u201d he added.Mr. Osha described Providence\u2019s strengths as its proximity to New York and Boston and its \u201cvery active, collaboratively focused universities,\u201d which also include the Rhode Island School of Design and Johnson & Wales University.For example, the design school and the University of Rhode Island are working with the state\u2019s Lifespan health system and Ximedica, a contract medical design company, to start a New England Medical Innovation Center in the district. Peter J. Snyder, a senior vice president and the chief research officer at Lifespan, said the center would assemble teams of engineering, design and medical professionals to develop solutions for medical needs, perhaps spawning new companies in the process.Lifespan\u2019s Rhode Island Hospital, an academic medical center, \u201cis within a stone\u2019s throw of one of the best design schools in the country,\u201d said Mr. Snyder, who is also a scholar in residence at the Rhode Island School of Design. \u201cWe can bring them in, along with U.R.I.\u2019s school of engineering, and run many teams with a deep bench of talent across many specialties.\u201dMr. Katz said he thought most innovation districts were far from reaching their potential for employment and business growth.\u201cThere is an intense focus at universities on, how do we get better at commercialization?\u201d he said. \u201cThese are still early days, which I think is remarkable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lies, Incoherence and Rage on Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne thing you can count on in 21st-century U.S. politics is that Republicans will lie about taxes. They did it under George W. Bush, they did it under Barack Obama and they\u2019re still doing it under Donald Trump.Yet this time is different. It\u2019s not just that the lies have gotten even more brazen. There\u2019s now a combination of incoherence and rage that we, or at least I, haven\u2019t seen before. These days, they can\u2019t even seem to get their fake story straight \u2014 and they literally start yelling obscenities when someone tries to point out the facts.G.O.P. lies about taxes generally involve two issues: who is hurt or helped by tax changes, and what these changes will do to the budget.At the same time, the Bush administration used a series of gimmicks to hide the true fiscal cost of the plan, such as delaying the implementation of some tax cuts while pretending that others would expire when the actual intention was to make them permanent.Oh, and a memo to journalists: If you play it safe by reporting this as \u201cDemocrats say\u201d that middle-class taxes will go up, you\u2019re misleading your readers: Those estimates come from the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress\u2019s own nonpartisan scorekeeper.How can Republicans like Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, pretend to be helping the middle class? It depends crucially on a new kind of budget gimmick: Both the House and Senate tax-cut bills do contain some middle-class tax breaks \u2014 but only for the first few years. Then they expire.The Republican response is to claim that these tax breaks wouldn\u2019t really expire, that Congress would eventually renew them. That\u2019s quite doubtful \u2014 and even if true, it means that the tax plans would add much more to the national debt than the G.O.P. admits. Which brings me to the whole budget deficit issue.Not long ago, leading Republicans claimed to be deeply concerned about budget deficits. Only fools and centrists took the Republicans seriously. Still, the abrupt shift to nonchalance about adding trillions to the debt in order to cut taxes on corporations and the wealthy is causing a bit of whiplash even among cynics. How do they justify the shift?Sorry, but this isn\u2019t the righteous anger of a man falsely accused of wrongdoing. It\u2019s the rage con men always exhibit when caught out in their con.But what\u2019s the con about? The very incoherence of the arguments Republicans are making for their plans shows that it\u2019s not about helping the economy, let alone ordinary families. It really is about making the rich richer, at everyone else\u2019s expense. If this be bull crap, make the most of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The U.S. Added 261,000 Jobs in October; Here\u2019s the Upshot", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe hurricane-battered job market surged back to life in October, the government reported on Friday, the latest sign that the American economy has entered perhaps its strongest stretch of growth in years.Yet the latest round of jobs data did nothing to resolve the question that has bedeviled the economic recovery for years: When will job growth translate into strong wage gains for American workers? Average hourly earnings were 2.4 percent higher in October than a year earlier, barely keeping pace with inflation.Considering the tight labor market, with unemployment at its lowest level since Bill Clinton was president, many economists say the dividends have been paltry.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly trending the right way, but it\u2019s surely still unexciting \u2014 even unacceptable \u2014 wage growth at this point,\u201d said Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America.The storms\u2019 effects were clearest in the weather-dependent leisure and hospitality sector, which lost 102,000 jobs in September, then gained them all back and more \u2014 106,000 jobs \u2014 in October.The hurricanes\u2019 damage to the labor market also was not quite as bad as initially believed. The Labor Department on Friday revised its estimate of September payrolls from a decline of 33,000 \u2014 the first net loss in jobs in seven years \u2014 to an 18,000-job gain. With the revision, the economy has now added jobs for 85 straight months, a record.Economists recommended setting aside both the September and October reports and instead focusing on the longer-term picture. The United States has been adding about 170,000 jobs a month this year, the slowest pace since 2010 but still a rate most economists consider fundamentally healthy.The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell yet again to 4.1 percent, its lowest level since 2000. The labor force shed 765,000 workers in October, but most economists dismissed the drop as a correction after four straight months of gains.\u201cThe trend is rock-solid,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, director of real-time economics at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe labor market just continues to chug along, and it\u2019s showing very little evidence of slowing.\u201dBut consumers are no longer alone in driving the economy forward. Stronger global growth (along with a weaker dollar) has led to higher demand for American goods and services in recent months, aiding the manufacturing sector and increasing exports.\u201cIt\u2019s finally feeling like the economy is starting to fire on multiple cylinders rather than relying solely on consumers,\u201d said Brett Ryan, an economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.President Trump hailed the strong jobs report on Friday afternoon, tweeting \u201cJOBS, JOBS, JOBS!\u201d Many economists, however, argue that the president deserves little credit for the strong job market, which predates his time in office. And the recent run of strong economic data could complicate the Republican argument that a tax cut is needed to promote economic growth.The strong economy, however, only adds to the enduring mystery of anemic wage growth. Average earnings actually fell slightly in October compared with September, and although that was partly a statistical quirk caused by the hurricanes, the slowdown was larger than most economists expected. The year-over-year pace of growth, at 2.4 percent, was the weakest since early last year.The problem is hardly a new one. Throughout the recovery, there have been predictions that wage growth would accelerate as unemployment fell. And throughout the recovery, those hopes have been dashed. Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com, likened wage growth to a baseball team that keeps crushing fans\u2019 hopes for a championship.\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to \u2018wait till next month\u2019 for better growth in wages,\u201d Mr. Hamrick said. \u201cIt\u2019s been disappointing for years now.\u201dSome industries are seeing faster growth \u2014 and not just for high-earners. In recent months, there have been hints that wage gains are filtering down to workers in fast food and other low-wage industries. In September, the retail giant Target announced that it was raising pay for all its workers to at least $11 an hour and would pay at least $15 an hour by the end of 2020. That move, and others like it, is putting pressure on other low-wage employers to increase pay.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to retain employees when those companies are saying, \u2018Any employee in our company is getting at least $15 an hour,\u2019\u201d said Jennifer Durham, chief development officer for Checkers and Rally\u2019s, a drive-through burger chain with 860 locations across the country.So far, however, Checkers and Rally\u2019s has resisted broad-based pay increases, choosing instead to focus on helping employees earn more through advancement.\u201cBase pay is a starting point, but it\u2019s not the entire proposition,\u201d Ms. Durham said.Instead, economists point to another factor holding back wage gains: productivity. Growth in productivity \u2014 how much workers can produce in an hour, on average \u2014 has been slow, making it harder for companies to improve wages without eating into profit margins.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get wages really taking off without productivity growth,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.Productivity growth accelerated in the third quarter, though it is too soon to know whether the that represents the start of a longer-lasting rebound. And despite the disappointing pay data, there are signs that companies are being forced to work harder to attract employees, and to keep the ones they have from bolting to competitors. A report from the payroll-processing firm ADP this month found that people who switch jobs are seeing significant pay gains, which suggests workers are jumping ship in search of better opportunities.David Staszewski, executive vice president of sales for Wireless Zone, a cellphone retailer, said that over the last six months, the company\u2019s franchisees had increasingly complained about holding on to workers. Many of them have had to raise pay or restructure commissions to keep employees, he said.\u201cThey\u2019ll move at the blink of an eye and really not care,\u201d Mr. Staszewski said. \u201cA friend of theirs will call up and say, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s better over here,\u2019 and they will up and leave.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the labor-force trend for October. The labor force fell by 765,000; it did not grow.Advertisement"}

Just last week a bipartisan group of senators agreed to consider liberating midsize banks from the regulatory constraints of being officially regarded as too big to fail. On Monday, Mr. Simmons announced his Utah-based institution would lobby watchdogs to nix its status as a SIFI \u2014 a systemically important financial institution.Mr. Simmons\u2019s pitch for leaving the club of his own accord is straightforward. Zions, he argues, is both a simple bank, involved in taking deposits and making loans, and too small to impact the financial system or the broader national economy should it falter. Washington clearly agrees, and not just about Zions.A commitment to raise the bar for SIFI status to banks with more than $250 billion, from $50 billion today, is a rare instance of both parties agreeing on something. That doesn\u2019t guarantee action, though. So it makes sense for Mr. Simmons to hedge his bets by pushing ahead with the latest step in his plan to simplify the bank\u2019s business since it failed a Federal Reserve stress test in 2014.If either route succeeds, Zions shareholders should benefit. First, expenses will probably come down as compliance costs drop, though by how much remains unclear. Second, the bank will probably try to hand back more capital, perhaps eventually reducing its current 12.1 percent tangible common equity ratio to 9 percent. That would free up $1.6 billion, which could have boosted return on tangible equity from an annualized 9.5 percent in the first nine months to almost 13 percent.Zions is, at least, in a better position than some. Loans grew 4 percent in the 12 months to September, including 11 percent in its consumer business. And it lends out some 83 percent of its deposits, a higher ratio than most large-bank rivals.It\u2019s hard to make money on these with interest rates so low, of course. And the struggle to boost returns, especially with potentially reduced oversight, could foment dumb credit decisions. As the financial crisis showed, no bank is too small to get that wrong \u2014 not even Zions, whose stock price hit $88 in February 2007, before the bust in which it received taxpayer aid.

{"Headline": "Senate Republicans Will Diverge From House in Sweeping Tax Rewrite", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans, under pressure to pass a sweeping tax rewrite before year\u2019s end, are expected to unveil legislation on Thursday that would eliminate the ability of people to deduct state and local taxes but would stop short of fully repealing the estate tax, according to lobbyists and other people familiar with the bill.The Senate plan is taking shape as Republicans digest the drubbing they suffered on Tuesday night in affluent suburbs across the country, many of them represented by Republicans in the House. Those areas are stocked with well-off voters who would be disproportionately hit by the elimination of state and local tax deductions.But in the Senate, those high-tax areas are often represented by Democrats, which puts less pressure on Republican leaders to keep the state and local deduction, in any form, in their version of the bill.Each of the bills reflects delicate political and fiscal calculations as Republican leaders seek to deliver on President Trump\u2019s campaign promises to cut taxes on the middle class and on businesses \u2014 but also find the money to pay for them. Eliminating the state and local tax deduction would increase tax receipts and therefore lessen the overall cost of the legislation, which by congressional budget rules cannot exceed $1.5 trillion over the next decade if it is to pass without Democratic support.After the elections, Republicans understand they have to pass a tax bill in order to show a significant accomplishment. Big losses in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday exposed their vulnerabilities going into next year\u2019s midterm elections.But in the Senate, the emerging bill suggests party leaders are less concerned with the potential fallout of eliminating breaks that benefit upper-middle-class taxpayers in high-tax states such as New York and California.Republican officials say many more changes will be included in the Senate plan, which is planned for release on Thursday, the same day that the House Ways and Means Committee is expected to pass its version of the bill ahead of a full House vote next week.The Senate bill diverges from the House legislation currently under consideration in several key ways, starting with the provision to completely eliminate, rather than limit, the ability of individuals to deduct state and local income, sales and property taxes on their federal tax returns.The House bill would allow property tax deductions of up to $10,000, a concession to House Republicans in New York, New Jersey and other states where constituents pay high property taxes. But that concession has not been enough to placate some Republicans whose constituents make heavy use of the existing deduction for state and local taxes.The major findings in a preliminary analysis of the House Republican tax plan.The Senate version will also seek to further limit the number of people who pay the estate tax, instead of eliminating the tax entirely as the House bill would do over time, according to officials in the White House and Treasury Department.In addition, the Senate bill will include more tax brackets than the four currently in the House bill. It will also jettison a controversial business tax currently in the House version that has caused an outcry from multinational corporations.The House provision would impose an excise tax of 20 percent on payments made by American companies to foreign affiliates, in an effort to prevent firms from shifting profits abroad through royalties and other payments made to subsidiaries or other foreign affiliates. American multinational corporations say the tax will wind up harming American companies and their consumers and drive up prices.Influential conservatives inside and outside of Congress are warning Republican leaders that they must deliver a tax bill or risk alienating their biggest donors and their core voters. House Republicans from some politically moderate districts, particularly those in wealthy suburbs, are wrestling with the potential consequences of voting for a bill that could end lucrative tax breaks for many of their constituents.Democrats are all but daring them to vote for the bill, anyway, brandishing polling data suggesting voters will recoil at provisions that cut taxes for companies and the rich.Those political cross currents are both aiding and complicating Republicans\u2019 search for their first major legislative victory of Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure.Tuesday\u2019s outcome \u201csimply means we got to deliver\u201d on the tax bill, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said at an event on Wednesday that was hosted by The Washington Examiner.But several House Republicans have already spoken out against the House\u2019s tax plan. Listing Republican losses on Long Island in Tuesday\u2019s elections, Representative Peter T. King of New York said on Wednesday that the results should provide a wake-up call to lawmakers about the risk of losing middle-class voters who were drawn to Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019m convinced we\u2019re going to lose them with this tax bill,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cThe picture they see is an indifference to the middle class, but taking care of special interests. And that\u2019s not why they voted for Donald Trump.\u201dMr. King, who opposes the bill as written, rejected the idea that Republicans, above all else, must pass a tax bill so they can show a major accomplishment.\u201cHow can you vote for tax reform if it\u2019s going to increase the taxes in your district?\u201d Mr. King asked, suggesting lawmakers would have to say: \u201cGreat victory! We got the first tax reform through in 30 years. Your taxes are going up, but it\u2019s O.K. because we got it through.\u201d\u201cPeople will think you\u2019re nuts,\u201d Mr. King said.Republicans are pushing their bill through a process that would allow the legislation to pass without Democratic votes, but one Senate Republican cautioned on Wednesday that the election results show the need for bipartisanship.\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s the message from the election, that Republicans and Democrats should work together to solve the country\u2019s big problems,\u201d said Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas. \u201cWhile I think it\u2019s important for us to accomplish tax reform, again how we do it and what the end result is matters.\u201dThat is precisely the message that Democrats have tried to hammer home as they relentlessly criticize the bill. On Wednesday morning, emboldened Democratic leaders sought to capitalize on the electoral wins and pressure Republicans to abandon their plans to move forward with tax legislation that includes benefits for companies and the rich, along with tax cuts for some \u2014 but not all \u2014 middle-class families.\u201cThe Republicans should look at the elections last night and it should be a giant stop sign for their tax bill,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said at a news conference held outside the House Ways and Means Committee hearing room.Mr. Schumer argued that the Republican plan to repeal the state and local tax deduction would cause particular pain to middle-class families who live outside of cities.Invoking Clint Eastwood, Mr. Schumer said, \u201cYou want to pass this tax bill? You want to hurt the suburbs? Make our day.\u201d\u201cThe Republicans are in charge, and we promised to fix it, and we have to go fix it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t fix it, then the American people are entitled to say, \u2018Well, you know, how\u2019d you people make it through the birth canal, for God\u2019s sakes?\u2019 And I don\u2019t blame them. They ought to be asking that question.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go pass this bill,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019d rather drink weed killer than not pass this bill.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Plan Could Increase Taxes on Some Middle-Class Workers", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, acknowledged on Friday that the Republican tax plan might result in a tax hike for some working Americans, saying he \u201cmisspoke\u201d days earlier when he said that \u201cnobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase\u201d under the Senate bill.\u201cI misspoke on that,\u201d Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said in an interview on Friday with The New York Times. \u201cYou can\u2019t guarantee that absolutely no one sees a tax increase, but what we are doing is targeting levels of income and looking at the average in those levels and the average will be tax relief for the average taxpayer in each of those segments.\u201dThe Senate bill unveiled on Thursday would raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, according to a preliminary New York Times analysis. The plan would also disproportionately benefit high earners and corporations. Still, middle-class earners would fare better under the Senate proposal than its counterpart in the House, the analysis found.The Senate Finance Committee bill would, on average, cut taxes for people at every income level. But, as Mr. McConnell alluded to in his revised remarks, those benefits would vary widely within income brackets, depending on the specific circumstances of individuals and households, and many would pay more than under existing rules.Republican lawmakers have been in a dash to devise \u2014 and pass \u2014 a tax overhaul that would mark their most significant achievement since taking control of Congress. President Trump and Republican leaders have outlined two main objectives for the rewrite: cutting taxes for American businesses and for the middle class. The legislation reduces tax rates on individuals and businesses, while eliminating some tax breaks to make up for lost revenues. It is meant to accelerate economic growth and increase wages for workers.Both the House and Senate bills would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and provide business tax benefits, such as the ability to immediately expense purchases of equipment.The Times analysis, using the open-source software TaxBrain, found that roughly one-quarter of families in the middle class would see their taxes increase in 2018, by about $1,000 on average. By 2026, the share seeing an increase would rise slightly, to about one-third, and the average increase would rise to about $1,600. For the majority of middle-class families that receive a tax cut, the average savings would be about $1,300 in 2018 and $1,700 in 2026.The Times analysis defines the middle class broadly as those earning between two-thirds and twice the median household income, or about $50,000 to $160,000 per year for a family of three. To focus on families, the analysis excluded individual filers and households headed by people 65 or older and is adjusted for the size of each household.Under the House bill, The Times has found, about half of middle-class families would pay more in taxes in 2026.The analysis did not seek to calculate how workers might benefit from a steep cut in the corporate tax rate, which both the Senate and House bills would reduce to 20 percent from a top rate of 35 percent today, or project how the bills might increase economic growth and, with it, Americans\u2019 wages.For taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year, the Senate bill offers a more limited upside and downside than the House bill.The Senate bill is less likely than the House bill to yield tax increases for high-income Americans, in part because it cuts the top marginal personal tax rate, while the House bill creates a so-called \u201cbubble rate\u201d that would actually raise taxes on many high-salaried workers.The Senate measure would also produce a smaller average tax windfall for high earners than the House version, in part by offering less generous benefits for owners of businesses known as pass-throughs, which are not organized as corporations.Under the Senate plan, \u201cAmericans are especially likely to face a tax increase if they have a smaller family, have mostly wage income instead of investment income, or claim some of the many deductions that the bill repeals, like those for state and local taxes and employee business expenses,\u201d said Lily Batchelder, a professor and tax specialist at New York University Law School, who worked on economic policy in the Obama administration. \u201cThey are increasing taxes on many in the middle class, while concentrating their tax cuts on the wealthy.\u201dThe Senate bill appears much better for the very wealthy than it is for the somewhat wealthy. About half of families earning between two and three times the median income \u2014 or about $160,000 to $240,000 for a family of three \u2014 would pay more in 2018 than under existing law. But among the richest families, those earning more than about $500,000 for a family of three, nearly 90 percent would get a tax cut.The findings come with an important caveat: The Senate bill, as written, appears unable to muster the 60 votes needed to avoid a Democratic filibuster, meaning Republicans will need to amend it to comply with the budget reconciliation rules and allow permit passage by a simple majority. Those changes could likely include putting expiration dates on some of the bill\u2019s major provisions, which could make the final version of the bill look less favorable to the middle class, particularly in later years.The Times\u2019s figures are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data using a tax model from the Open Source Policy Center, a Washington research organization affiliated with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Because the analysis is based on publicly available data, not actual tax records, it may not capture all the intricacies of Americans\u2019 household finances.The Senate bill differs sharply from the House version in its approach to cutting taxes on businesses. But when it comes to taxes on individuals and families, the bills are more similar than different. Both would double the standard deduction while eliminating a raft of deductions and credits. Both would make the child tax credit more generous. Both would restructure federal income tax brackets to impose lower marginal tax rates at most income levels, although the Senate approach, unlike the House version, doesn\u2019t eliminate two brackets entirely.The Senate bill includes features that would make its plan more favorable to the middle class. It preserves some popular tax deductions and credits that the House bill initially would have eliminated, and it makes the child tax credit somewhat more generous and widely available. On the other hand, the Senate bill, unlike the House version, would eliminate the deduction for property taxes, which could lead to higher federal taxes for homeowners in areas with high property tax rates or expensive housing markets.Aparna Mathur, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said senators could improve the bill with further changes, such as expanding the earned-income tax credit and extending the benefits of the child tax credit to more low-income taxpayers. \u201cWe clearly need to do more to help the lowest-income families,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, we can engage in more base broadening for the highest-income households, perhaps by eliminating and not just capping the mortgage-interest deduction.\u201dThe Times analysis found that roughly one-fifth of the Senate bill\u2019s cuts in 2018 would go to families and individuals earning $1 million or more, and close to half would go to people earning at least $200,000. Between 10 million and 15 million taxpayers earning less than $100,000 a year would pay more than under existing law.Families earning more than $1 million a year would see their after-tax income rise by about 1.7 percent in 2018 compared with what they would make under current law, nearly triple the gains enjoyed by those earning less than $200,000.Over all, the Senate bill would cut individual income taxes by about $30 billion in 2018, and by $900 billion over the next decade, according to Congress\u2019s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. And most people in all income groups would see a tax cut, although the cuts would be modest for most lower earners.Jim Tankersley reported from Washington, and Ben Casselman from New York.

He wrote a clear, fluent collection largely about men; she uses empty spaces, hesitations and semantic difficulties to address mothers and daughters, herself as mother and herself as daughter, and the messy emotions and miscommunications that move between languages (in her case, English and Spanish), as well as between and within female bodies, in breastfeeding, menstruation, giving birth. Alcal\u00e1\u2019s short, wry lines, self-interruptions and open spaces remind us how little precedent there is for honest writing on these topics, compared with the epic traditions of fathers and sons. Her overall mood remains haltingly elegiac, with quips, false starts and white space, though she can also deploy irony to point up injustice, as in the prose poem \u201cVoice Activation\u201d: \u201cLuckily, I have no accent and you can understand perfectly what I am saying to you.\u201d Her circumlocutions can point back to the avant-garde community within which Alcal\u00e1\u2019s early work grew, seeking a style that \u201cisn\u2019t meant / to be sold / or bought.\u201d Elsewhere she is pellucid, as well as laconic, and might make you cry: \u201cThree times on Saturday / I remember you / as dead, / mam\u00e1. / I reach under / my shirt / surprised / to find / the nipple dry.\u201dMadrid has written a fascinating series of puzzles without solutions, a set of poems almost all in the same few invented forms, all held together by rhymes and repeated words even as their apparent topics fly apart. Most of the poems here are printed in quatrains, with rhyme that can cross stanzas: All the quatrains in a poem begin with the same phrase (which is also the title) and seem to have no topic in common (most poems that don\u2019t use this structure use a similar one, in tercets). The results suggest the Persian-Urdu ghazal, as well as the melancholy, almost bitter nonsense of Edward Lear. Take this quatrain from \u201cBottles and Cans\u201d: \u201cBottles and cans.

Much / Adidgeradoo about nothing.\u201d For all its semantic leaps, and its swaths of confusion \u2014 exacerbated by inter-poem echoes and compound words from German and Sanskrit \u2014 the kaleidoscope of scenes, quotations and exclamations let me imagine a poet behind the poems, a restless skeptic, aggressive talker and armchair traveler, \u201cone of those who have a delight in / Renouncing whatever they chose.\u201dA far ampler set of challenges awaits American readers in this career-spanning selection from Moure, the much-honored Canadian poet who began in the late 1970s as the exponent of a cerebral, knife-sharp feminism: \u201cYou find out there was never enough time. / You find out you shouldn\u2019t have washed the dishes.\u201d During the 1980s her books tried to untangle power and patriarchy and mere habit from the roots and boles of a newer language, as well as to alter the shape of the poem on the page. The results, with their \u201cpeaceable discontinuity,\u201d could end up airily theoretical, or startle with sudden passion, almost as in the long poems of C.D. Wright: \u201cWhen your ankle touched my shoulder / the cord shudders in the spine.\u201d The later Moure pays homage to role models like the Brazilian novelist Clarice Lispector; she also translates poetry, and makes her own poems reflect the process of translation, veering \u201cout of the monolingualism \u2026 that would keep boundaries pure.\u201d Moure\u2019s sense remains hard to fix, which is part of her point: Translations with real originals, ambient thoughts carved from air, design elements from art books, and slices of philosophy circulate in work created never to settle down, never to narrow to any one point.Stephanie (Stephen) Burt\u2019s latest collection of poetry, \u201cAdvice From the Lights,\u201d was published last month.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Perth Amboy, N.J.: Historic Buildings and Affordable Housing", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving In11 PhotosShortly into the new millennium, the future looked hopeful for Perth Amboy, N.J., a city on Raritan Bay a skipping stone\u2019s throw from Staten Island. As part of a larger revitalization plan, the town\u2019s mayor at the time, Joseph Vas, promised a $600 million development at the water\u2019s edge, with 2,200 housing units, shops, a hotel and high-speed ferry service to New York.But then the economy tanked. The developer, Kushner Companies, constructed only two buildings, with fewer than 200 housing units altogether. And the mayor, Mr. Vas, was convicted on unrelated corruption charges.Then came Hurricane Sandy.Caroline Pozycki-Torres, the founder of a nonprofit that organizes local cultural events, moved to Perth Amboy in 2006, and in 2010 paid $250,000 for a 1,700-square-foot condominium in an 1890 house on Water Street, near the bay. A former chair of the municipal arts council, she has introduced to the city a waterfront arts festival, moonrise concerts, a pop-up cinema and a public mural project.Ms. Pozycki-Torres described her life among sailboats and sea breezes as a rare gift. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in nonprofits all my life, and my husband is a musician,\u201d she said, noting that Perth Amboy is attracting an increasing number of artists.Also well situated is Alan Silber. In 1987, he and his wife, Sonia, paid $135,000 for an 82-year-old, three-bedroom house on Rector Street near the waterfront, which he said is worth about $220,000 today. But Mr. Silber, a retired distribution manager, emphasized that the area, with its endearing Victorian houses, is only one part of the town, and in some ways its own country.\u201cThis is how we sell Perth Amboy,\u201d he said of the neighborhood, which slopes up from the bay and has a recently renovated park that hosts Sunday concerts in summer, which is sure to appeal to prospective buyers from the city. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t Perth Amboy.\u201dHe and many of his neighbors rarely shop in the commercial area along Smith Street several blocks away, he said, preferring to drive to nearby malls.But Barry Rosengarten, a developer who chairs Perth Amboy\u2019s business improvement district, said the downtown is due for at least one large upgrade: New Jersey Transit has allocated funds for a $50 million redevelopment of the 1920s train station there, he noted.Such measures would help Perth Amboy join many other New Jersey cities in developing housing around transportation hubs. In support of this direction, Mayor Wilda Diaz\u2019s office recently presented a plan to commercialize several blocks of Front Street near the water and raise the heights of downtown buildings.William Petrick, the City Council president, said the plan may not sufficiently address problems with aging infrastructure, including a neglected water supply and sewer system. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be a Debbie Downer,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have some great history, and we need to focus on marketing that.\u201dPerth Amboy was first incorporated in 1683. It has wonderful historic buildings in various states of repair. Its city hall, part of which dates to 1714, is the oldest continuously operating municipal building in the United States. The last British royal governor\u2019s palace in existence is on Kearny Avenue \u2014 a building called Proprietary House, where Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Loyalist son, William, briefly lived before his arrest by militiamen.Perth Amboy also has a long post-colonial history of immigration, as conveyed by a neighborhood called Budapest and another formerly known as Dublin. About 80 percent of the town\u2019s 52,000 residents are Latino, including the mayor, whose parents were born in Puerto Rico.David Caba, a local real estate agent, said buyers from New York are attracted not only to the single-family Victorians on the historic waterfront, but also the midcentury ranch homes in Spa Springs, a neighborhood with easy access to the Outerbridge Crossing to Staten Island. The nest of highways cutting through the city also includes the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway.Multifamily homes are more common in the center of Perth Amboy, Mr. Caba said, and are frequently bought by outside investors who rent them.Harbortown, a townhouse development below Route 440 that is expanding east toward the water, has a mix of condominiums and rental units; eventually there will be 1,800 units in all.Enrique Hernandez, founder of Petra Best Realty in Perth Amboy, said the housing market has picked up in the last two years because of continuing low interest rates and an infusion of buyers who have repaired bad credit and can now obtain financing. Demand has driven down inventory, so that only about 60 single-family houses were on the market as of November, compared with double that number two years ago, he said. And the supply of multifamily homes sharply decreased as well during the same period, from about 65 to 12.According to the real estate website Trulia, from May 24 to Aug. 23, the median sales price for homes in Perth Amboy was $210,625, based on 60 transactions, a year-on-year increase of 3 percent.Mr. Hernandez also noted a strong rental market. Monthly rents range from about $1,000 a month for a one-bedroom unit in a downtown building with a business on the lower floor to $2,600 for a three-bedroom townhouse in what he described as a \u201cgood area.\u201dStanding at the shore, looking north over rippling water to the bridge to Staten Island and the garden of giant white petroleum tanks next to it, one is reminded that nature, historic pedigree and heavy industry make strange bedfellows in a town. Ms. Pozycki-Torres may have summed up Perth Amboy\u2019s jagged edges best when she described her life there as \u201cvery chill, but also very intense.\u201dAmong Perth Amboy\u2019s five elementary schools, Robert N. Wilentz, founded in 2000 to help ease overcrowding, enrolls about 960 students in kindergarten through fourth grade. On 2015-16 state tests, 36 percent met standards in English compared with 57 percent districtwide; 34 percent met standards in math versus 71 districtwide.One of two middle schools, William C. McGinnis enrolls 1,522 students in fifth through eighth grades. On state tests, 31 percent of students met standards in English versus 29 percent districtwide; 17 percent met standards in math versus 14 districtwide.Perth Amboy High School serves about 2,500 students in ninth through 12th grades. Mean 2016 SAT scores were 434 for reading/writing and 448 for math, versus 537 and 538 statewide.As the town\u2019s student population continues to swell, a new high school is planned on Convery Boulevard. And ground was broken last month on Seaman Avenue for a 128,000-square-foot elementary school that is scheduled to open in the fall of 2019.New Jersey Transit\u2019s North Jersey Coast line offers frequent train service from Perth Amboy to Pennsylvania Station. Rush hour trip times range from about 45 minutes to an hour and cost $12.25 each way, or $353 for a monthly pass. A bus operated by New Jersey Transit travels from Perth Amboy Station to Port Authority in about an hour and costs $10.75 each way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biggest Tax Scam in History", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald Trump likes to declare that every good thing that happens while he\u2019s in office \u2014 job growth, rising stock prices, whatever \u2014 is the biggest, greatest, best ever. Then the fact-checkers weigh in and quickly determine that the claim is false.But what\u2019s happening in the Senate right now really does deserve Trumpian superlatives. The bill Republican leaders are trying to ram through this week without hearings, without time for even a basic analysis of its likely economic impact, is the biggest tax scam in history. It\u2019s such a big scam that it\u2019s not even clear who\u2019s being scammed \u2014 middle-class taxpayers, people who care about budget deficits, or both.One thing is clear, however: One way or another, the bill would hurt most Americans. The only big winners would be the wealthy \u2014 especially those who mainly collect income from their assets rather than working for a living \u2014 plus tax lawyers and accountants who would have a field day exploiting the many loopholes the legislation creates.Meanwhile, the bill would partially repeal Obamacare, in a way that would sharply reduce aid to lower-income families and raise the cost of insurance for many in the middle class.You might wonder how such a thing could possibly pass the Senate. But that\u2019s where the scamming comes in.But the operative word here is \u201ctemporary.\u201d All of these tax breaks either dwindle over time or are scheduled to expire at some point; by 2027 the bill is, as I said, a tax increase on the middle class used to pay for tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy.Why would anyone write a bill full of provisions that evaporate over time? There\u2019s no economic or policy logic behind it. Instead, it\u2019s all about trying to have it both ways, making a safe space for political double talk.Here\u2019s how it works: If you point out that the bill hugely favors the wealthy at the expense of ordinary families, Republicans will point to the next few years, when the class-war nature of the plan is obscured by those temporary tax breaks \u2014 and claim that whatever the language of the law says, those tax breaks will actually be made permanent by later Congresses.But if you point out that the bill is fiscally irresponsible, they\u2019ll say that it \u201conly\u201d raises the deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade and doesn\u2019t raise deficits at all after that \u2014 because, you see, those tax breaks will expire by 2027, so the tax hikes will raise a lot of revenue. By the way, the claim that middle-class taxes will rise is crucial to passing the bill: Only bills that don\u2019t raise deficits after 10 years can bypass the filibuster and be enacted by a simple Senate majority.The point, of course, is that these claims can\u2019t both be true. Either this bill is a big tax hike on the middle class, or it\u2019s a huge budget-buster. Which is it? Nobody really knows; probably even the people who wrote this monstrosity don\u2019t know. But someone is being scammed, bigly.So it\u2019s a giant scam. And while the exact nature of the scam may be unclear, ordinary American families would end up being the victims either way.So will they manage to pull off this giant con job? The reason they\u2019re rushing this to the Senate floor without a single hearing, without a full assessment from Congress\u2019s own official scorekeepers, is their hope that they can pass the thing before people figure out what they\u2019re up to.And the question is whether there are enough Republican senators with principles, who believe that policies should not be sold with lies, to stop this bum\u2019s rush.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Empty Rail Cars Roll Into the Adirondacks, Stirring Controversy", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMINERVA, N.Y. \u2014 The Hudson River is a small stream as it courses through pristine forests in the Adirondacks in northern New York, not far from its source on Mount Marcy, the state\u2019s highest peak.During World War II, the federal government built a 30-mile long railroad that sliced through this verdant patch, stretching from North Creek to Tahawus, a remote village about 125 miles north of Albany.State officials opposed the railroad at the time because of its intrusion on the Adirondack Forest Preserve.But the war effort superseded environmental concerns and the tracks were laid. The railroad was needed to carry ilmenite, a mineral used to make titanium for armored vehicles, from mines in Tahawus.Today, a new battle is raging over plans to store up to 3,000 empty rail cars on the tracks, which were reopened five years ago after nearly a quarter century of remaining idle. More than 80 cars, some of which had been used to transport oil, began arriving a few weeks ago from the Midwest, to the consternation of environmental groups backed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.\u201cIt is unsightly,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Cuomo told reporters recently in Glens Falls. \u201cIt is out of character with the Adirondacks. Nobody goes to the Adirondacks to look at old trains. They go there to look at the natural beauty.\u2019\u2019Iowa Pacific Holdings, a rail company based in Chicago, bought the rail line with plans to haul rocks from abandoned mines that could be used for large-scale construction projects such as building roads. So far, however, the firm has not found a market for the venture.Instead, Iowa Pacific has begun leasing rail space, about 100 cars per track mile, to rail companies that want to store cars that are not needed.Ed Ellis, the president of Iowa Pacific, said leasing space raises money needed for track maintenance and repairs.In addition to the old mining rail line, Iowa Pacific also operates a connecting railroad, the Saratoga and North Creek Railway, which runs 60 miles from Saratoga Springs to North Creek, home of the Gore Mountain ski resort. It began operating the railway, which is used primarily for sightseeing rides, in 2011 under a lease agreement with Warren County and the town of Corinth, which own the tracks on the scenic railroad.Iowa Pacific, however, is responsible for maintaining the tracks from Saratoga to Tahawus, which Mr. Ellis said costs more than $750,000 per year. Leasing storage space on the tracks, Mr. Ellis said, is a way to generate revenue to allow the company to run the scenic railway while it continues to seek customers for the rocks from the mines.\u201cWe\u2019re patient investors,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not about quarterly earnings. This is about the long-term future of railroads.\u201dBut critics suspect that the storage deal will prove anything but temporary and oppose parking the rail cars for aesthetic reasons and also over concerns that the cars could damage the environment if they start deteriorating.\u201cIn essence, Iowa Pacific is trying to build this linear junkyard through the Adirondack Park,\u201d said Peter Bauer, the executive director of Protect the Adirondacks, an environmental group. \u201cIt appears that Iowa Pacific will continue to bring in more oil tanker cars until the state steps in and halts this activity.\u201dMr. Ellis said that all the rail cars had been inspected and thoroughly cleaned by their owners.The state Department of Environmental Conservation and the Adirondack Park Agency, another state entity that regulates land use in the park, also oppose the storage arrangement. \u201cWe are seriously concerned about potential environmental impacts and are evaluating all legal and regulatory options at our disposal,\u2019\u2019 the agencies said in a joint statement.But so far no action has been taken.Most of the mining rail line crosses through Essex County, which borders Warren to the north. \u201cThe Adirondacks are beautiful and we want to keep it that way,\u201d said Stephen R. McNally, the supervisor of the town of Minerva, which is in Essex.Warren County officials say they are disappointed by the performance of the sightseeing railroad, which they say has not lived up to promises by Iowa Pacific that it would boost the local economy.Iowa Pacific was supposed \u201cto support economic development and business activity that creates jobs in our area,\u2019\u2019 said Ronald F. Conover, the chairman of the Warren County board of supervisors. \u201cStoring rail cars doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dNot everyone, however, is against the storage of rail cars.\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope,\u201d said Thomas R. Scozzafava, the supervisor of the town of Moriah in Essex County. \u201cWhere does it stop? It\u2019s like trying to tell a grocery store, we don\u2019t like the shopping carts out front. What about car dealerships and marinas? Are we going to tell them they can\u2019t store cars and boats? It\u2019s a railroad, that\u2019s what you do.\u201dMr. Ellis downplayed the argument that the line of parked rail cars are unsightly, noting that they are over two miles from the nearest road. \u201cThe cars are really out of sight, out in the middle of nowhere, in a place that\u2019s seldom seen,\u201d he said.Mr. Bauer is among a number of environmentalists who would prefer that the railroad tracks be torn up and turned into a recreational trail, something that has been done across the country in places where tracks have been largely abandoned or barely used.For now, though, empty rail cars continue to arrive in the forest with more to come, a consequence in part of the rising global supply of oil for which there are no customers.Iowa Pacific says it is simply trying to take advantage of what is happening in the oil market to finance its business.\u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity to make money,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Ellis said, \u201cyou make money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Erdogan Helped Turks Evade Iran Sanctions, Reza Zarrab Says", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey personally ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in an oil-for-gold scheme that violated United States sanctions on Iran, according to testimony on Thursday by a Turkish-Iranian gold trader in a federal trial in Manhattan.The gold trader, Reza Zarrab, who helped orchestrate the billion-dollar scheme, recently pleaded guilty to conspiring to evade the sanctions and has become a witness for American prosecutors.On Thursday, Mr. Zarrab testified that in 2012, a senior Turkish official told him that Mr. Erdogan \u2014 now Turkey\u2019s president, at the time its prime minister \u2014 and a second official, the treasury minister, had given orders for the banks \u201cto start doing this trade.\u201dMr. Zarrab\u2019s testimony marked the first time Mr. Erdogan has been implicated in the alleged sanctions busting, which first surfaced when the Turkish police uncovered the activity in 2013 \u2014 only to have their investigation quashed by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government.Mr. Erdogan has consistently condemned the American investigation into the scheme, raising the matter repeatedly with American officials, including President Trump in September. On Thursday, before Mr. Zarrab, 34, told his story to jurors in Federal District Court in New York, Mr. Erdogan said, \u201cWe did not breach the sanctions.\u201d\u201cWhatever the verdict is, we did the right thing,\u201d he said at a closed meeting with his deputies, Turkish state media reported. \u201cWe have never made commitments to the U.S. on our energy ties with Iran.\u201d\u201cThe world is not only about the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also have trade and energy relations with Iran.\u201dMr. Zarrab\u2019s testimony about Mr. Erdogan was relatively brief, coming in the first week of the trial of a Turkish banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, 47, who was also charged in the scheme.Mr. Zarrab testified that it was Zafer Caglayan, Turkey\u2019s economy minister at the time, who said Mr. Erdogan had directed the two banks, Ziraat Bank and VakifBank, to participate in the scheme. Mr. Caglayan \u201ctold me that Mr. Prime Minister had given approval for this work,\u201d Mr. Zarrab said through an interpreter, referring to the Iranian trade.On Wednesday, Mr. Zarrab testified that he had paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to Mr. Caglayan; he said Mr. Caglayan asked for 50 percent of the profits generated by the scheme, which prosecutors say was being run through a Turkish state bank, Halkbank. On Thursday, Mr. Zarrab said he had also paid bribes to the general manager of Halkbank, Suleyman Aslan, whom he described as being critical to the arrangement.Mr. Caglayan and Mr. Aslan, who have also been charged in the case, remain at large, prosecutors have said.Mr. Zarrab testified that he had never paid a bribe to Mr. Atilla \u2014 the defendant being tried, who was the deputy general manger of Halkbank.In Turkey, reaction to Mr. Zarrab\u2019s allegations was muted. Mainstream television and news outlets have largely kept to the government line that the trial is a plot against Turkey, and have not reported the potentially most explosive allegation: that Mr. Erdogan was involved.Many Turks have turned instead to social media, which has been buzzing about the trial. But some fell quiet after Mr. Zarrab seemed to implicate the president. One Turkish user said on Twitter that he did not dare write what he was hearing \u2014 and then deleted even that tweet.Mr. Zarrab maintained his respectful tone in a second day of testimony on Thursday, but one aspect of his appearance did change: his clothing.On Wednesday, Mr. Zarrab testified while wearing tan-colored jail clothes. But after the jury was sent home for the day, Judge Richard M. Berman asked whether there was any reason the witness could not appear in civilian clothes.\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to appear in court,\u201d Judge Berman said. \u201cThere is certainly no reason to make things more difficult by not providing, for example, a shirt and a tie or jacket or whatever.\u201d He said he would sign an order to that effect.Even Mr. Atilla, the defendant, who is being held in jail, was granted permission to wear a suit during the trial \u2014 a common courtroom practice.On Thursday, Mr. Zarrab testified in a sport coat and white dress shirt, though no tie.When the prosecutor, Sidhardha Kamaraju, asked why he had changed his clothing, Mr. Zarrab said it had been done \u201cwith the permission of the honorable judge.\u201dJudge Berman then interjected. \u201cI may be overly sensitive to the clothing issue,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cAnd the reason is that I\u2019m always hearing in the back of my head my wife saying, \u2018What are you wearing?\u2019 So, anyway.\u201dMr. Zarrab\u2019s testimony continued.Follow Benjamin Weiser on Twitter @BenWeiserNYTCarlotta Gall contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

This time it was to India, where I learned a ton that I didn\u2019t know: I found India trying to leapfrog out of poverty and catch up to China by engaging in a rapid digitization of its entire economy and power grid.Yes, while our president has been busy playing golf, tweeting about LaVar Ball and pushing an anything-that-will-pass tax plan, China has been busy creating a cashless society, where people can pay for so many things now with just a swipe of their cellphones \u2014 including donations to beggars \u2014 or even buy stuff at vending machines with just facial recognition, and India is trying to follow suit.These are big trends, and in a world where data is the new oil, China and India are each creating giant pools of digitized data that their innovators are using to write all kinds of interoperable applications \u2014 for cheap new forms of education, medical insurance, entertainment, banking and finance.I was blown away by one big change in India in particular. In 2009, my friend Nandan Nilekani, the tech entrepreneur, led a team of experts that helped the then-Congress Party-led government launch a national digital identity system, known as Aadhaar (Hindi for \u201cbase\u201d).Every Indian, rich or poor, goes into a field office, has fingerprints and irises scanned into a biometric database and then linked to the individual\u2019s 12-digit ID number with basic identifiers: name, address, date of birth and sex. When the Congress Party left office in 2014, and Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party took over, Modi continued and impressively energized the Aadhaar project, bringing it today to 1.18 billion users, out of a population of about 1.3 billion.In a country where many poor people lacked any form of ID, like a birth certificate or a driver\u2019s license, this has been a revolution, because they can now open a bank account and get government aid sent directly to them \u2014 rather than having bureaucrats, bankers or postal workers skim off 30 percent each year through the mail \u2014 and then link their bank account to their mobile phones, from which they can buy, sell, transfer money and receive payments digitally anytime anywhere.The digital network platforms that have broken the one-billion-plus user mark \u2014 like Facebook, Google and WhatsApp \u2014 all came out of the private sector. Aadhaar, noted the Harvard Business Review, is the only non-U.S. platform \u201cto have broken the one-billion-user threshold and the only such system to have been developed by the public sector.\u201d It also has the distinction of \u201chaving reached one billion users the fastest.\u201dWhen the British laid railroads in India it led to the more efficient extraction of natural resources. Now the Indian government, through the combination of a trusted unique ID platform \u2014 tied to cellphones and mobile bank accounts \u2014 is creating a kind of digital railroad enabling the more efficient empowerment of human resources.\u201cIt\u2019s transforming the lives of ordinary people,\u201d explained Alok Kshirsagar, a McKinsey partner based in Mumbai. \u201cMillions are already benefiting from digital payments and credit. There are already more than 30 percent productivity gains when digital capabilities are used in agriculture, transportation and manufacturing. We are in the early stages of a transformation that could generate as much as $1 trillion in economic value over the next seven to 10 years.\u201dNow any Indian farmer can just go to one of 250,000 government community centers \u2014 each with a computer, Wi-Fi and a local entrepreneur who manages it \u2014 log into a government digital services website with the farmer\u2019s unique ID and instantly print out a birth certificate or land records needed for transactions.An Indian friend told me: \u201cMy driver has two bank accounts, and he has given one debit card to his wife and another to his son. And now he tells me he puts X amount of his salary into one account and Y into another, using his cellphone, so his wife is empowered and not asking her mother-in-law for money, because she has her own debit card, and the son, who is off in school training to be a doctor, can be independent.\u201dNilekani and his wife, Rohini, have built a foundation, EkStep, to create mobile education apps to help parents, teachers and students \u2014 armed only with cellphones \u2014 to learn faster, using these new digital networks. As Shankar Maruwada, an EkStep co-founder and its C.E.O., explained: Unlike, say Facebook, whose business model is to \u201cretain your attention,\u201d EkStep, Aadhaar and other such \u201csocietal platforms\u201d are designed to \u201crestore your agency,\u201d particularly to the poor.The West got economically rich \u201cbefore it got data rich,\u201d added Pramod Varma, EKStep\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cSo when data came along, it just became a better way to sell you things. They could target you better; you became a better customer for them. But in a country like India, where per-capita income is $2,000, today you can get data rich before you get economically rich. And if you empower people with their data, they can use their data to get better loans, get better skills, and build a digital repository that captures their skills to get better salaries.\u201dSimilar innovations are going on in energy, explained Mahesh Kolli, president of Greenko, India\u2019s largest renewable power provider. Theft of electricity from state-owned distribution companies amounted to some 20 percent of their output, as people strung wires to siphon from the grid, or the companies couldn\u2019t identify users.Now the government \u201ccan link my unique ID to my electricity bill\u201d and then directly and digitally connect my government subsidy, if I am poor, to that electric bill, said Kolli. Greenko just built the largest solar project in the world \u2014 a 3,000-acre field of Chinese-made solar panels generating 800 megawatts powering over 600,000 homes in Andhra Pradesh. Two more such fields are on the way up, all connecting to the national grid.Oh, and by the way, for those of you who want to preserve coal jobs, this 800-megawatt solar farm \u201cwas built with over 5,000 skilled and semiskilled workers,\u201d said Kolli. \u201cWe believe the renewable energy sector will create over one million new generation jobs to meet the 175-gigawatt target set by Prime Minister Modi.\u201dGreenko builds these plants, he added, \u201cin five months using Chinese panels and European inverter-grid integration technologies made in India.\u201d (Notice the absence of U.S. technology in that loop.) Greenko is also making huge strides in battery technology to store solar energy, so it can be used when the sun is not shining, and the company is now in the midst of building the first grid-connected battery storage system integrated with its solar farms.\u201cNo new coal or gas power plants are being built in India today,\u201d he added, \u201cnot because of regulations, but because solar, wind, hydro are all now able to compete with coal plants without subsidies.\u201dBottom line, the Indian energy economy is rapidly transitioning to a \u201cdecarbonized, digitized and decentralized\u201d system, said Kolli, enabling better quality of life while meeting big energy needs \u2014 without the government having to deal with all the protests that come with building coal- or gas-fired plants.So while we\u2019ve been following Trump\u2019s tweets about bringing back \u201cbeautiful coal,\u201d India built a billion-user ID network bigger than Twitter and giant solar power plants that are cheaper than coal.That\u2019s what you missed \u2014 and that\u2019s just one country. Are you tired of winning yet?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rev-Up: Imagining a 20% Self-Driving World", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "Call it 20 percent: the day, if it ever arrives, that one out of five vehicles you encounter will be driving itself. In some ways, the 20 percent era is harder to imagine than the fully automated era, because this supposedly unstoppable and frictionless technology will still be embroiled in a total mess. The best, safest models will most likely come with the highest price tags, out of reach for those with average incomes. Coexistence between human and robot drivers will be uneasy at best; road rage against the machine will boil over. One catastrophic accident could still imperil the whole experiment, no matter what the overall statistics show.But that inevitable mess is precisely what makes the one-in-five future so interesting to ponder. It\u2019s the first point, give or take, when it will be clear that a true self-driving future is even possible. When car companies will actually be able to rip out the steering wheels from some models, designing them in entirely different ways. When big trucking firms and car services like Uber will have begun to remove drivers from their vehicles. When hypercommuters will trust their cars to drive them three hours to the office while they sleep. When you might risk putting your child in one, alone.The autonomous vehicle went from test-track prototype to showroom reality far faster than I envisioned, propelled as much by advances in sensors and A.I. as by a collective hype cycle that seemed intent on willing these devices into existence, whether society was ready for them or not. Sitting with that \u201cbeginner\u201d driver in 2008, as engineers closely observed its movements, took me back to that life-defining moment of getting a driver\u2019s license. In my wallet, sparse with a library card and a school-lunch ticket, the license had real heft. It represented a primordial entry point to adulthood, a vast expansion of social possibility.As a rite, the driver\u2019s exam \u2014 I have failed it in two countries \u2014 is a ritual by turns (three-point, of course!) tedious and terrifying. If you can summon nothing else of the 1988 teen comedy \u201cLicense to Drive,\u201d you can still see James Avery\u2019s gleefully malevolent D.M.V. examiner, wielding his famous coffee cup. Once autonomous technology begins to really take off, will the driver\u2019s license, and the pedagogy behind it, go the way of the stick shift? Will the ability to drive begin to seem some exotic, rarely necessary skill \u2014 like starting a fire with a flint?After all, in a vehicle that meets the Level 5 automation criteria of SAE International \u2014 \u201cfull-time performance by an Automated Driving System for all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions\u201d \u2014 there would seem to be little point in possessing this vestigial skill. We don\u2019t require people entering elevators, riding in airport trams or letting Roombas loose upon their living rooms to be able to take over operation in case of machine failure; it\u2019s hard to see why our interaction with this automated technology should be any different. Our learning process could be as quick and dirty as it is with other high-tech products: Toss out the instruction manual and watch someone do it on YouTube.But this possibility, driver made passenger, broaches new territory in jurisprudence. With no licenses, what is the legal basis for restricting anyone \u2014 tweens, the elderly \u2014 from being ferried about? Young farm kids\u2019 driving the family truck seems as obsolete as tail fins, but what\u2019s stopping kids from being driven? Could children, often more adept at handling the smartphones of their parents than their owners are, have an advantage on older drivers less accustomed to technology? Yet the same fears that keep parents from letting their children walk to school may prevail over the allure of their autonomous vehicle handling the school run. It seems hard to say whether autonomous vehicles would hasten or delay the passage to adulthood.And as drivers interact with semiautonomous vehicles in the long run-up to Level 5, driver education and licensing, far from becoming obsolete, may become more important, argues John D. Lee, a professor of engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cAutomation has a strong tendency to surprise people with unexpected behavior,\u201d he says. Knowing what your car is doing \u2014 and when to take over \u2014 could be more vital than merely knowing how to drive. That water on the road \u2014 is it a surface puddle, or a veritable lake filling a gigantic pothole? That truck ahead with the dangerously swaying load \u2014 do you speed up to pass it? Is the pedestrian by the marked crosswalk waiting for you to yield or simply checking his iPhone? \u201cDriving and managing the automation that is helping you drive,\u201d Lee says, \u201care two quite different skill sets. Automation-management skills need to be learned as much as driving skills.\u201dTom Vanderbilt is the author of \u201cYou May Also Like\u201d and \u201cTraffic.\u201dDriverless cars will sometimes need to move around the city with no humans in them at all \u2014 en route to pickups or drop-offs. As empty moving vehicles become a common sight, they\u2019re sure to enable an annoying off-label use: a flowering youth subculture of external joy riding, similar to subway surfing.All over the country, bored teenagers will lurk on the roadside, waiting to leap onto the roofs of empty cars, hanging on for as long as they can. The surfers will take advantage of advances in cloaking technology to help them confuse the cars\u2019 sensors. Some will develop a clever assortment of grips and attachments to help them stay on, although the best among them will sneer at those who need to use tools. Fatalities will be inevitable, and often gruesome.To keep the kids off, car owners will try to coat their cars in slick repellents; these will be effective but too messy to be practical. Soon, dealers of autonomous cars will offer optional rows of spikes similar to those we already use to keep homeless people off benches. Once again, design will become more hostile in the name of safety.Rollo Romig is a journalist based in New York.Liberated from having to watch the road, commuters\u2019 eyes will be free to \u2014 what else? \u2014 consume video content. Sound\u2019s hold on drive time \u2014 first with terrestrial radio, then satellite radio, then podcasts \u2014 will gave way to sight. But what kind of videos will we watch? If Marchetti\u2019s constant holds (this is the idea that as transportation technology and urban planning change, people contort their lives to keep their commutes to an average of one hour per day), they will be not feature films but TV shows and short videos of the kind being increasingly produced for Facebook and YouTube. Podcasts will be displaced by vodcasts. Media companies are already negotiating with carmakers about how to price their offerings. Should in-car entertainment work more like cable or like the on-demand system in a hotel? Like Netflix or like Roku?Most riders who play games will use their phones. But by the time one in five cars is autonomous, console makers will develop specific products for it. The nearly two hours a day of console gaming played by some 60 million Americans will tick up accordingly. Swarms of commuters hitting the morning and evening roads in waves will become swarms of druids or mercenaries in massively multiplayer online games, some of which might come to incorporate the driving experience itself, a Pok\u00e9mon Go for the highway.It seems less likely that we\u2019ll use this opportunity to steal time back from screens. But if there\u2019s enough space for a table, maybe commuters will sit around it playing poker or telling stories. Cars are, indeed, the most private places we have, sealed shut, out of earshot. (The writer Nicholson Baker has said that he likes to write while in a car parked in a shady spot.)Chris Anderson \u2014 formerly the editor of Wired, now the head of a drone-data company and, in his spare time, of a racing league for autonomous cars \u2014 says the question of what we\u2019ll do inside self-driving cars always comes up at cocktail parties. It always confounds him. \u201cWe have this world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s called the back seat of an Uber.\u201d We already know what passengers do in back seats, be they in a limo or an R.V. or a tour bus: They pull out their phones or their iPads, or they talk to one another, or they take a nap. Why should we think that not having a driver will change anything?In an essay for Real Life magazine titled \u201cPerpetual Motion Machines,\u201d Chenoe Hart argues that we miss something when we think of autonomous cars this way, as a difference in degree, not in kind. Because we won\u2019t have to worry about driving, vehicle interiors can expand to a point where we\u2019 stop thinking of them as vehicles: They might have fully functional kitchens, or gyms, or beds. Instead of going to the coffee shop, the coffee shop might come to you; instead of going into the garage to pull out your car, the garage will be the car. The ability to summon spaces like this, Hart writes, will turn the built environment into a kind of random-access memory \u2014 with every destination equally accessible from anywhere. Whether it drove to you or you to it will be irrelevant; motion will be so smooth and constant as to be imperceptible. Hart argues that when travel becomes fully autonomous, we will always be traveling: families or co-workers in quiet concert on giant roads, moving in a cluster of moving buildings, chasing good weather, hardly aware that we\u2019re going anywhere at all.James Somers is a writer and programmer based in New York.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.It\u2019s not as straightforward as it sounds. For one thing, the vehicles would not be freed from the laws of physics. Should your car abruptly brake while you were, for example, running on a treadmill, the treadmill would cease moving forward \u2014 but you wouldn\u2019t, at least until you hit a windshield or door.It might be easier to remain seated. \u201cThe car could have special pockets all over the place that hold resistance bands of different strengths,\u201d says Bryant Johnson, a personal trainer and the author of \u201cThe Ruth Bader Ginsburg Workout.\u201d \u201cYou could use those to get a full-body strength-training workout.\u201dThroughout your commute, your future car could scrutinize your efforts, says Steve McCauley, the head of health services for the Wynn Las Vegas resort, with fingertip monitors or other sensors tracking your heart rate and the composition of your sweat.But realistically, many of us will use our salvaged commuting time otherwise. In tomorrow\u2019s cars, the area beneath the hood may not be needed for a combustion engine, Vujicic says \u2014 but it will remain, for reasons of mechanical stability and safety. Fitted with some padding and a safety belt, it becomes a napping cave.If self-driving cars start to make up a significant portion of urban traffic, they\u2019re likely to push cities to become more populous and compact, with fewer owned vehicles and more car sharing. The future, that is, would look more like Singapore, one of the world\u2019s densest cities, whose government in recent years has tried to curb car ownership and ease congestion problems. We reached out to Limin Hee, the director of research at Singapore\u2019s Center for Livable Cities, to ask her about how she thinks autonomous cars will begin to change urban life.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.These exploits, though dramatic, took advantage of the same vulnerabilities in cellular networks that might plague any tablet or smart vacuum cleaner. But a future in which one in five vehicles is autonomous will not only increase the attack \u201csurface\u201d (in the metaphor favored by researchers) of the car; it will also force manufacturers to confront more insidious security risks that are only now coming into view. It will become possible to compromise vehicles by hacking the environment.A car that drives itself uses sensors to construct high-resolution images of its surroundings, then runs them through a \u201cclassifier\u201d to identify all the objects in the image. The classifier can do this because it has trained on labeled images; after seeing a hundred thousand trucks, it learns to recognize certain features as indicating truck-ness. Today\u2019s most popular and effective classifiers for object recognition, used widely in self-driving car software, are called deep neural networks.But a deep neural network offers researchers very little understanding of why objects become classified as they do. Think of its output as a map, with each classification corresponding, like a ZIP code, to some demarcated region. Instead of existing in just two dimensions, though, the map has more like a thousand dimensions \u2014 and the slightest move in any one of these dimensions can push us into a different ZIP code and produce a false classification. This makes it possible for a hacker to construct slightly perturbed images, called \u201cadversarial examples,\u201d that look innocuous to the human eye but fool the car\u2019s brain into making the wrong call, with potentially fatal consequences.Adversarial examples are extremely difficult to defend against. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand these attacks,\u201d says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut the deeper question is that we don\u2019t understand deep neural networks.\u201d In a recent paper, Song and her co-authors introduced a method of constructing robust adversarial examples that can even be printed on paper and pasted to road signs. A stop sign defaced with specially calibrated graffiti, for instance, is recognized as a 45 m.p.h. speed-limit sign.Song\u2019s warning extends beyond road infrastructure. While researchers for decades have been working on \u2014 and developing countermeasures for \u2014 software vulnerabilities, the study of security issues related to deep learning is still in its infancy. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a precise mathematical definition of a pedestrian,\u201d Song says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for us to write down a formula describing exactly what a pedestrian is. So we can\u2019t even really define our security goals.\u201d Even with a recent surge of interest in adversarial examples, researchers are still struggling to understand the scope of the problem. Given the physical-world ramifications, Song says, \u201cwe should have started even sooner.\u201dYiren Lu is a writer and software engineer in New York.The trickiest part of the transition to a self-driving future may be figuring out liability when accidents do happen. Instead of quarreling only about which driver was at fault, we will also be able to argue about whether the self-driving features in either car may have played a role. A preview of these complications was evident in the aftermath of the crash that killed Joshua Brown, the Ohio man whose autopiloted Tesla ran into a tractor-trailer. Federal investigators determined that the accident was not caused by a defect in the autopilot software, and Tesla has said repeatedly that drivers should always have their hands on the wheel even when they are using the technology. But officials noted that Tesla\u2019s technology was unable to detect cross-traffic like that presented by the tractor-trailer. Tesla subsequently updated its software to make similar accidents less likely in the future.So who was responsible for covering the damages? The insurance policy that covered Brown, who may not have fully understood the capabilities of his car, or Tesla? Neither Tesla nor Brown\u2019s family has commented on who paid. And both car insurers and insurance regulators have been relatively slow to contend with the difficulty in assigning liability when a person is driving a car only part of the time. \u201cInsurance policies have not necessarily caught up with the global advancement of A.I. technology in cars,\u201d Brown\u2019s lawyer told me.Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley, which is racing to raise the curtain on the era of autonomous vehicles, is also thinking about insurance. A start-up called Driav intends to bring down insurance rates by monitoring the reams of data coming out of self-driving cars in order to figure out, on a second-to-second basis, who or what caused the errors that led to a crash. \u201cIt\u2019s silly that claims are a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 argument,\u201d Dan Peate, Driav\u2019s chief executive, told me. \u201cThe data can just tell us what happened.\u201d The company hopes to begin offering insurance policies next year, with the expectation that they will be cheaper in part because the cars will be in fewer accidents and in part because it plans to be able to shift some liability onto the carmakers.In the long run, when all vehicles are driving themselves, the manufacturers themselves are very likely to assume all of the blame for accidents. Most such companies have said that they plan to pay for anything that happens while their cars and software are in charge. When that\u2019s the case, insurance begins to look a lot more like a product warranty, covered by the carmaker, than a stand-alone product that a customer has to worry about. But in the transition years until then, there are likely to be a lot more messy arguments.Nathaniel Popper is a technology reporter for The Times.When I think about the future these days, I inevitably return to a tweet from the writer Elizabeth Hamilton-Argyropoulos (a.k.a. @bourgeoisalien): \u201cThe saddest part about self-driving cars will be all the times people die mid-trip and then ur dinner guests or pizza guy will arrive dead.\u201d To read this joke is to become immediately certain that this will absolutely happen \u2014 of course it will! \u2014 and that it will furthermore become as much a part of the texture of everyday future life as, say, traffic delays caused by collisions are now. Admittedly, the dead-pizza-guy notion doesn\u2019t seem very likely: A large part of the impetus behind the development of self-driving technology in the first place is the desire to do away with the need for flesh-and-blood people who demand wages for their work. But the image feels symbolically resonant precisely because of the ghostly future of all those moribund jobs. Self-driving cars bearing the earthly remains of the recently deceased \u2014 automated Ubers, say, with heart-attack victims sprawled incredulously across the rear seat \u2014 are, in this sense, an extreme metaphor for the near future of capitalism. The technology will be miraculous, yes; but if it functions as intended, it will serve as an uncanny vector of human obsolescence.Mark O\u2019Connell is a writer based in Dublin.\u201cRide-sharing\u201d was always a misnomer for companies like Uber and Lyft. As with the rest of the \u201csharing economy,\u201d nothing was ever being shared; labor and services were being bought and sold. But as ride-share companies have grown, their ambitions have multiplied and compounded. Currently, their horizons are limited by widespread car ownership, alternative transit options and, primarily, their own cost. But autonomous cars make their grander plans \u2014 dreams of vast fleets of perfectly allocated and used vehicles \u2014 more plausible. They zero out a single variable, the cost of labor, that these companies believe is holding them back from utterly reshaping the world. Ride-share businesses are uniquely poised to manifest and demonstrate the big ideas of self-driving cars. They aren\u2019t waiting for this change; they\u2019re doing everything in their power to hasten it. Autonomous cars aren\u2019t just part of the plan; they are the plan.Conservative estimates put the world\u2019s Ubers and Lyfts in an enviable position as self-driving cars roll out. Bullish projections put them in an unassailable one. A 2017 report by Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest, told the story in four numbers. A rider\u2019s \u201call-in cost per mile\u201d for average United States taxi services was about $3.50. For a human-driven Uber in San Francisco, that number was about $2.86. Assuming the same fuel price, the figure for personal cars is much lower, at around 70 cents. The estimate for self-driving taxi services, circa 2020, would cut that cost in half.At 35 cents per mile, tasks that were previously too expensive or that would have felt ridiculous become reasonable and routine. A world in which moving yourself or moving things to you costs almost nothing in terms of money or attention would remake places and transform lives. It would also bring with it new and complicated absurdities \u2014 the sort Americans adapt to quickly and then forget. (Like bottles of water shipped around the world and sold for $2, or electronics products assembled in one country from parts from six others, to be shipped to a seventh.)Riders will thrill to this new infrastructure as it incorporates the roads around them, providing novel experiences and conveniences. But this excitement will prevent us from seeing that our aspiring fleet managers hope to create something like the profound consolidation of the internet\u2019s recent past. Just as Amazon the online store laid the groundwork for Amazon the comprehensive and omnipresent service, apps for human-driven taxis may have laid the groundwork for a thrumming on-demand grid, on which people and things can be placed and retrieved.Like Google and Facebook before them, which remapped, rerouted and dominated the old and diverse web infrastructure on which they were built, Uber and Lyft could say, credibly, that they work better with size and full participation. That market domination is merely the flip side of completeness. They will aspire to monopoly and could achieve, with startling speed, real and unprecedented claims over the roads we share \u2014 they will say they\u2019ve found a better use for them, and if all goes to plan, riders will agree.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The Times.Unless you\u2019re a millionaire or a truck driver, your first encounter with a self-driving vehicle will probably be a car you ordered through a ride-hailing app like Lyft or Uber. These companies, which spent the first stage of their lives trying to get drivers into their cars, are spending the next one trying to get them out. There will be some initial awkwardness around self-driving vehicles, just as there was around ride-hailing in the first place. (Remember when it was weird to get into a stranger\u2019s unmarked car?)But Lyft, for one, is betting that it can put a trustable face on the tech. In July, it announced Level 5, a lab where it will work on its own driverless software, in addition to developing an open self-driving network that companies like Ford and Jaguar Land Rover will be able to plug their vehicles into. The idea of the network is to combine multiple kinds of autonomous vehicles under one routing-and-request system, so that when you order a Lyft, the app will assess your route, check the weather and other factors and send you the best ride, whether that\u2019s an autonomous Waymo or a human-driven S.U.V. John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s co-founder and president, explained its thinking.Kevin Roose is a business columnist for The Times and a writer at large for the magazine.For reasons that have gone unstudied, humans become horny in transit. With the proliferation of subway systems came the proliferation of subway gropers. With commercial air travel came the \u201cMile High Club.\u201d Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee filmed their famous sex tape on a boat (I\u2019m told). There\u2019s something about transportation that gets people in the mood. What is it?My theory is simple. In our capacity as humans, we have three speeds at which we operate: crawl, walk and run. In other words: extremely slow, slow and slightly less slow. When we engage with equipment that increases our velocity, we become excited. This excitement applies in all cases, whether we\u2019re talking about an escalator, a moving walkway, a bicycle, a roller coaster, a golf cart or a Chrysler LeBaron. It is fundamentally thrilling to travel at an unexpected speed. When the enabling mode of transportation is one that permits our excitement to be processed as erotic energy \u2014 even if that processing is specifically legislated against \u2014 some of us will do that. The distance between \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cstimulated\u201d is, after all, incredibly short. If there were a way to have sex on a bicycle, people would be bike-sexing all the time. It would have its own verb.Having sex in a car is not currently impossible, but it is difficult. Hand-eye coordination, a mechanism critical for sex-having, is compromised for the driver, whose hands must remain on the wheel and eyes on the road. In road couplings, the driver is not an equal contributor. Unless, of course, the driver doesn\u2019t need to drive at all. Which brings us to the self-driving car: basically a motel room on wheels. The one hindrance to this development is existing public-lewdness laws, which are fairly expansive. You can\u2019t intentionally get naked and perform a \u201clewd act\u201d in a public place without risk of penalty. Obviously. But you also run a risk if you perform your lewd act in a private place with the intention of being watched \u2014 say, in a self-driven automobile slowly cruising past a school bus where my future grandchildren are watching in horror as a frenzied orgy unfolds within smelling distance. I am confident, however, that the law will be updated to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable car-based encounters.And if not, industrial designers can come up with clever \u201csolves,\u201d the word that start-ups use for some reason instead of \u201csolutions.\u201d If car windows no longer need to function as navigating aids, why not tint them to inky obscurity? Or replace them with mirrors facing outward? Or mirrors facing inward? Or remove them entirely? Future riders may not even need a human partner in order to have an intimate appointment. Nissan is working with Microsoft to develop an \u201cin-vehicle virtual personal assistant\u201d which, if deviously hacked, could provide the 21st-century equivalent of phone sex.More interesting than the aesthetics of car sex will be the cultural consequences. New slang terms will arise. New positions. New trophies. (How many times can you have sex in the time it takes to drive from Las Vegas to Los Angeles?) Virginities will be lost, children conceived, marriage vows consummated and violated. Car-based kinks will be minted and postcoital rituals established. New professional opportunities will emerge: interior decorators who specialize in \u201cself-driving bedrooms\u201d; entrepreneurs who launch apps to enable no-strings-attached in-car assignations. Preferences will be identified and explored. The world will expand in narrow but pulse-quickening ways \u2014 not a sexual revolution, but a plot twist.Molly Young is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Wins and Who Loses From the Republican Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Veterans of previous efforts to rewrite the tax code warn that overhauling the tax code is hard because it creates winners and losers \u2014 and the losers fight harder than the winners to make sure the legislation fails.The tax plan released by House Republicans on Thursday did not disappoint, cutting taxes and erasing popular deductions in ways that would reorient big chunks of the American economy.The bill loses revenue in some areas and raises it in others, and those are where the battle lines will be drawn in the coming weeks, as members of Congress scramble pass a law that President Trump wants to sign by Christmas.Slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent would be a boon to firms that for years have complained of being shackled by high taxes. It remains to be seen if the benefits of this lower rate would be felt more by shareholders or workers. In selling the plan, Republicans have said that employees of companies would see their salaries rise because of a lower corporate tax rate.\u201cAnything that brings down corporate tax rates in the right way here in the United States would be helpful,\u201d Kevin P. Clark, chief executive of Delphi Automotive, said on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call.American multinational companies fare well under the plan, which calls for shifting toward a more territorial tax system, albeit with caveats. The plan levies a 10 percent global minimum tax on overseas earnings, but that\u2019s still far below the current 35 percent they need to pay on income that\u2019s returned home. In theory, the new system will reduce the \u201clockout\u201d effect that encourages firms to stash cash abroad.The plan would also force companies to pay a one-time 12 percent tax on \u201cliquid\u201d assets that are held overseas, like cash. They would have eight years to pay the tax.The Republican tax plan would collapse the income tax brackets to three from seven and nearly double the standard deduction, meaning many middle class families would see smaller tax bills. However, this impact will vary depending on every taxpayer\u2019s individual situation. People who live in high-tax states and currently itemize their tax returns could pay more because of the limitations on the state and local tax deduction.The capping of the mortgage interest deduction could also impact middle class families who live in states with high property taxes. And, if the legislation dampens home prices, as realtors are warning, it could diminish the wealth of middle class families whose biggest investment is generally their home.Despite all of the talk about helping the middle class, it is hard to argue that the wealthy do not benefit from the tax plan. The top tax rate for millionaires holds steady at 39.6 percent, while the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax or A.M.T. \u2014 which hit primarily wealthy Americans \u2014 are ultimately eliminated. Mr. Trump, a billionaire, has criticized the \u201cdeath tax\u201d and the A.M.T. provisions over the years as unfair.President Trump campaigned on getting rid of the so-called carried interest loophole, which allows fees paid to some of the richest people on Wall Street to be taxed at low capital gains rates, not income tax rates. But it makes no appearance in the House plan.Carried interest, which is essentially the profits reaped by hedge fund managers and private equity executives, is currently taxed at a long-term capital gains rate that is about half the roughly 40 percent ordinary income rate for the highest earners.The tax plan doubles the standard deduction and caps the mortgage interest deduction at $500,000, down from $1 million. It also caps property deductions at $10,000. This significantly weakens a tax incentive that has encouraged many Americans to buy homes rather than rent. Homebuilders and realtors quickly came out against the bill, warning that it could create a recession in the housing market and cause a slide in home prices.Under the Republican plan, the deduction for medical expenses would be eliminated. This currently applies to taxpayers, spouses or other dependents with health expenses that exceed a tenth of the taxpayer\u2019s income. AARP, which advocates for retirees, said that they strongly opposed the repeal of the deduction and said that doing so would impose a \u201chealth tax\u201d on the oldest and sickest Americans.Like the housing industry, charities are also fretting about the impact of doubling the standard deduction. While charitable deductions are preserved in the plan, middle class families that take advantage of the larger standard deduction could be less likely to give to charity as a way of reducing their taxable income. This, in turn, could mean less giving.Currently, private universities are exempt from the tax that private foundations pay on their investment income. That would change under the Republican plan, which would levy a 1.4 percent excise tax on private colleges and universities with at least 500 students and assets that are valued at $100,000 per full-time student. The plan will likely draw strong opposition from the higher education community. It would raise $3 billion in revenue over a decade.The tax plan calls for the repeal of a tax credit that drug companies use to perform clinical testing for drugs that treat rare diseases. The credit is central to the business model for such firms and eliminating it could mean that big pharmaceutical companies will have little reason to invest in drugs that help small patient populations.Republicans used to consider themselves deficit hawks, but their plan will add at least $1.5 trillion to the federal debt over a decade. Many economists think that it will be more than this, because Republican tax-writers are using optimistic assumptions about economic growth when assessing their plan. If deficits continue to swell, it would depress economic growth and lawmakers would likely have to consider raising taxes or cutting spending to compensate as an aging population puts pressure on federal entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.The Republican plan repeals the tax credit currently allowed for taxpayers who own a \u201cqualified plug-in electric-drive motor vehicle.\u201d Under current law, a taxpayer may claim a maximum credit of $7,500 for each qualified plug-in electric-drive motor vehicle placed in service. The bill would take that benefit away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico on Her Mind: How to Help a Stricken Island Called Home", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor two weeks after the devastation of Hurricane Maria in September, Frances Westerman, a retiree from Kent in northwestern Connecticut, said she got information from Puerto Rico only in dribs and drabs. Power and cellular towers were down and she couldn\u2019t connect with anyone at the condo complex in the island\u2019s southwest where she spends the winter every year.\u201cIt was very scary the first days,\u201d Ms. Westerman, 85, said of trying to find out what was going on from afar. \u201cWe also have family in Florida and we were going berserk with the hurricanes.\u201dSeasonal visitors to Puerto Rico \u2014 snowbirds, repeat tourists, those who spend the Christmas holiday with family or friends \u2014 joined in the collective hand-wringing over the aftermath of this year\u2019s powerful storms.Compelled by the devastation, many visitors have been monitoring the news on social media, sending over money and packages with supplies like bottled water and even signing up to volunteer in clean up and rebuilding efforts.And adjusting to the new reality, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company said it is working with hotels and tour operators to offer package deals at discounted rates to allow guests to combine vacation days with a volunteer stint in the recovery effort, a mix of volunteering and tourism known as \u201cvoluntourism\u201d that has become increasingly common in other parts of the world.A similar effort is underway in the United States Virgin Islands, another American territory in the Caribbean whose three islands \u2014 St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix \u2014 suffered modest to crippling losses from the one-two punch of Hurricanes Maria and Irma within a two-week span.But many loyal visitors, especially those with relatives, friends and property in the affected areas, say they are still planning to travel to their getaways, eager to somehow help out, if only by injecting tourist dollars into battered economies.That would be me.I have lived in several states for more than 40 years but was born and raised in San Juan and visit every New Year\u2019s Eve with my husband, Jim. In the agonizing first weeks after Hurricane Maria swept through Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, I learned about the fate of my sister and extended family, including a cousin with Alzheimer\u2019s living in a home for the elderly, at an excruciatingly slow pace and only through sporadic emails, texts, Facebook postings and snippets of phone conversations before the calls dropped. It was hard to sleep at night.My attention turned then to the touchstones and places that give Puerto Rico its beauty and culture and that I now realize I have taken for granted all my life.Ms. Westerman, who eventually confirmed the well-being of both her neighbors and condo and who has been mailing checks to some friends to help them cope, said she planned to see for herself.She and her husband were planning to go back this year for their usual December to mid-April stay in Boquer\u00f3n, a beach village in the town of Cabo Rojo on the southwestern tip of the island, with one condition \u2014 they will not fly down until the electricity is back on.\u201cIf worst comes to worst we go a month later,\u201d she said.Neighboring St. Thomas and St. John in the United States Virgin Islands had not fared much better.\u201cPower lines are strewn across our roads; utility poles snapped in half like matchsticks; boats lie sunken in the harbors; many thousands of our homes stand heavily damaged or destroyed and some of our major road systems are impassable,\u201d Gov. Kenneth E. Mapp of the United States Virgin Islands wrote in an Oct. 12 letter to Congress, estimating that rebuilding would cost $5.5 billion.In the meantime, tourism officials, hoteliers and others in the service industry were scrambling to get hotels, beaches and tourist attractions back on their feet to salvage at least part of their peak tourist season, a crucial economic engine that runs from mid-November to April 1.The Environmental Protection Agency and local government officials have warned against bathing in beaches, rivers and streams because of possible raw sewage discharges as a result of hurricane damage to treatment plants.In St. Thomas and St. John, major hotels have closed for 6 to 18 months and officials expected a significant decline in overnight visitors.\u201cWe lost the last quarter of the year,\u201d said Beverly Nicholson Doty, commissioner of tourism for the United States Virgin Islands.But tourism officials in the American Caribbean acknowledged that Irma, which made landfall in the Virgin Islands on Sept. 6 as a Category 5 hurricane, and Maria, which hit Puerto Rico barely short of that magnitude as a Category 4, were like no other hurricanes in recent history because of their power and overwhelming reach. In Puerto Rico, hardly a corner of the island was spared its destruction, officials said.A boat destroyed by Hurricane Irma in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.\u201cA hurricane like this changes the profile of tourists,\u201d Mr. Izquierdo said. \u201cThe diaspora now takes a greater prominence.\u201dThe disaster relief group, based in Massachusetts, had received more than 1,600 applications by the end of October but can accommodate only about 70 volunteers at any given time in spartan quarters. People can come for as long as they want to work in cleanup, mold remediation, building temporary classrooms and permanent reconstruction, among other efforts.Erik Dyson, All Hands executive director and chief executive, said the organization planned to extend its work to Puerto Rico by early 2018.\u201cAnyone can help,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for people to carry things. There\u2019s a lot of not highly skilled jobs.\u201dOne volunteer who arrived in early November, Sid Sharma, 48, of Allen, Tex., spent his honeymoon 26 years ago in St. Thomas, which he remembered as \u201clush, green and beautiful.\u201d A general contractor who does residential remodeling, he committed to three weeks of volunteer work.\u201cSeeing the devastation on the news, I just had a little time on my hands and a push from my heart,\u201d said Mr. Sharma, who is still married and the father of two children. \u201cThis is something that I should be doing.\u201d\u201cAt least you\u2019re doing something,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just feel so helpless up here.\u201dTourism officials say they have not totally given up on leisure travelers. Mr. Izquierdo noted that big attractions like Old San Juan suffered only \u201cminimal\u201d structural damage (although it lost many trees).And, he added: \u201cAt the core of every successful tourism destination is the quality of the people and hospitality, and that wasn\u2019t washed away by the hurricane. That\u2019s stronger than ever.\u201dBut some in the tourism industry warned that a minimum level of services is required to lure travelers back. Jack Richards, president and chief executive of Pleasant Holidays in Los Angeles, which books trips for 23 countries in the Caribbean, said that the destination must have electricity, phone service, internet, clean water and medical supplies \u2014 and no public health issues.\u201cGiven the level of devastation in Puerto Rico,\u201d Mr. Richards said, \u201cit\u2019ll take a long time for things to get restored.\u201dPuerto Rico residents like my younger sister, Mari Navarro, and two nephews were still living day to day in a kind of surreal, stressed-out world as November approached. Our family home in San Juan, not far from the airport, suffered only minor damages except for the landscaping, which was gone. But without electricity Mari was cooking on a small gas stove, washing clothes and towels by hand and using flashlights to see at night.My sister had prepared well for Hurricane Maria, but supplies were running low and she asked me to send D batteries for flashlights and a battery-powered fan. She had to line up for food and bottled water at stores.She was back on the job as an account executive with a health insurer but she avoided driving except to work, she told me, because most traffic lights were not working. On a recent outing, two cars in front of her had crashed into each other, setting off a panic attack.\u201cI\u2019m grateful that I have a roof over my head, that we\u2019re all working and that we\u2019re doing better than a lot of people,\u201d she told me over the phone, \u201cbut sometimes it\u2019s hard not to get depressed.\u201dThen she burst into tears. And I teared up too.Mireya Navarro is a former New York Times reporter and an author who was born and raised in San Juan, P.R.Advertisement"}

Earnings at firms that get a majority of their revenue from within the U.S., rose only 2.3 percent.That is a reversal of what many analysts expected at the beginning of 2017.

{"Headline": "Trump Wants More Big Infrastructure Projects. The Obstacles Can Be Big, Too.", "Date": "2017-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cNo longer will we allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and decay,\u201d Mr. Trump said in August.Other presidents, including Barack Obama, have tried with mixed success to streamline the approvals for big infrastructure projects by pushing federal agencies to do environmental reviews faster. Frequently, delays are caused because multiple agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Army Corps of Engineers, weigh in on the scope of an environmental review or have to issue separate permits before work can begin.The report estimated that the typical six-year delay in starting large building projects costs the country $3.7 trillion in lost economic activity, more than twice the amount needed to address the most urgent infrastructure needs. Along with roadblocks to speedy federal approval, the report blamed delays on such factors as fear of litigation and overly broad environmental reviews on all levels of government.Several recent projects illustrate the pitfalls new proposals confront and the challenge Mr. Trump faces in breaking the logjams.Long-overdue maintenance this summer to the train tracks leading to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan came against the backdrop of a much more ambitious project that never happened.The plan, known as Access to the Region\u2019s Core, or ARC, would have created a new tunnel underneath the Hudson River for New Jersey Transit trains. First unveiled during the 1990s, it was promoted as the nation\u2019s biggest public transportation infrastructure project and was supposed to cost $9 billion, create thousands of construction jobs and was funded by the federal government, New Jersey Transit and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.After years of environmental reviews, drilling of the ARC tunnel was underway in 2009. But construction stopped for a reason that has doomed other projects \u2014 disagreements among the various governments. In this case, it was New Jersey. Gov. Chris Christie, who originally supported the tunnel, killed it in 2010 for what he cited were issues related to potential cost overruns.Today, nearly a decade and a thousand train delays later, the concept behind the ARC tunnel has re-emerged in a reconfigured form as the Gateway Program, a $20-billion design that also involves a new rail tunnel below the Hudson River and the rehabilitation of an existing one. It would be used by New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains. A small portion of tunnel drilling for ARC will be used in GatewayNew York and New Jersey officials support the project, and the environmental review for it took only two years rather than the usual four, said John D. Porcari, the project\u2019s interim executive director. If all goes as planned, the Gateway project is anticipated to be completed in 2026.But there is still one hang-up: The Trump administration has yet to climb onboard.The law generally does not allow the federal government to pre-empt permitting decisions made by state and local officials. So even before federal delays might come into play, some projects are dead \u2014 or close to it \u2014 on arrival.An exception, experts say, involves areas overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, which has jurisdiction over projects such as natural gas pipelines and electric power lines.FERC\u2019s authority recently came into play during a dispute in New York State over a relatively small project: a proposed $38 million plan to build a 7.8-mile-long branch off an existing natural gas pipeline to connect it with a power plant near Middletown, N.Y.When the Millennium Pipeline Company announced the project in 2015, it drew opposition from communities opposed to hydraulic fracking, a controversial method of extracting natural gas that is banned in New York. State officials also jumped into the dispute, arguing in court that FERC had failed, among other things, to account for the environmental impacts of added greenhouse gas emissions from the power plant before approving the pipeline.But in June, a federal judge agreed with Millennium\u2019s argument that state officials had failed to voice their objections in a timely fashion and referred the issue back to FERC, which has since issued a waiver to allow the company to proceed. State officials have asked FERC to review the case. The expected cost of the pipeline extension has since risen to $57 million based on actions that the company said it had taken to address the state\u2019s concerns.Mr. Howard, the lawyer from Common Good, has argued that Congress should enact legislation that would give the federal government more authority to overrule state and local permitting reviews. No such proposal exists in Congress.Some projects that are big drivers of the economy do not involve federal approvals. Delays result from state and local decisions, and Mr. Trump \u2014 or any federal official for that matter \u2014 does not have the standing to intervene.Currently, cargo containers arriving at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles are picked up by tractor-trailers and driven to an existing BNSF site in downtown Los Angeles for transfer to trains. BNSF estimates show that it is a journey of 24 miles that 1,000 trucks make daily.In 2005, BNSF announced a proposal to build a transfer point just four miles from the ports that would reduce truck travel, highway congestion and air pollution, according to the company. In 2013, Los Angeles approved the company\u2019s environmental impact report and issued a construction permit. But an environmental group and a local air quality district challenged that decision, citing the facility\u2019s potential impact on nearby residential communities.In 2016, a California state judge upheld that challenge and ordered BNSF to expand its review to include a broader regional study assessing the facility\u2019s environmental impact. The company has appealed that decision and expects a decision in coming months.Building of any sort has environmental consequences, and big building can have big consequences, making environmental objections a central factor in delaying federal projects. Such a case is playing out in Utah.A proposed highway, known as the Northern Corridor, is intended to ease future congestion around St. George, one of this country\u2019s fastest-growing metropolitan areas. But the seven-mile-long highway also raises an environmental dilemma because a portion of it would run through federally owned land that is home to a protected species, the Mojave desert tortoise, which can live up to 50 years.The dispute over the highway has been underway for more than a decade. Local officials have argued that they could build the road without endangering the tortoises, and in 2009, a federal law directed the Bureau of Land Management to identify a possible route.Farmers in southern Missouri, who experience severe flooding, have long supported a plan to close a quarter-mile gap in a large levee along the Mississippi River. And since 1975, the Army Corps of Engineers has offered a variety of ways to plug the levee. But that would also drain wetlands and potentially increase flooding elsewhere, causing officials with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to put on the brakes.In 2007, a federal judge blocked further development on the $161 million project, which is known as the St. Johns Bayou and New Madrid Floodway, finding that the Army Corps had failed to use sound science to examine its environmental impact. The agencies then said they would work together to resolve their differences. But by 2013 the gridlock remained so intense that Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, placed a temporary hold on Gina McCarthy\u2019s nomination to head the E.P.A. in an effort to resolve the standstill.Last year, President Obama\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality, the White House office, sided with the opponents. It held that efforts by the Army Corps to mitigate the project\u2019s impacts, while extensive, were not enough.That, however, might not be the final word. The environmental council left the door open to resolution of concerns, and President Trump\u2019s nominee to head the Army Corps, Rickey Dale James, owns a business in the area and has been a longtime supporter of the project.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uwe Reinhardt, 80, Dies; a Listened-to Voice on Health Care Policy", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUwe Reinhardt, an economist whose keen, caustic and unconventional insights cast him as what colleagues called a national conscience in policy debates about health care, died on Monday in Princeton, N.J. He was 80.Professor Reinhardt helped shape health care deliberations for decades as a prolific contributor to numerous publications, an adviser to White House and congressional policymakers, a member of federal and professional commissions and a consultant and board member, paid and unpaid, for private industry.\u201cHis work was instrumental in advocating some of the reforms embodied in the Affordable Care Act, such as having Medicare pay for performance rather than entirely on a fee-for-service basis,\u201d Professor Janet Currie, the chairwoman of the Princeton economics department, wrote in an email.Another colleague, Stuart H. Altman, a professor at Brandeis University, wrote, \u201cNo one was close to him in terms of impact on how we should think about how a decent health care system should operate.\u201dIn 2015, the Republic of China awarded Professor Reinhardt its Presidential Prize for having devised Taiwan\u2019s single-payer National Health Insurance program. The system now provides virtually the entire population with common benefits and costs 6.6 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (about one-third the share that the United States spends).Professor Reinhardt argued that what drove up the singularly high cost of health care in the United States was not the country\u2019s aging population or a surplus of physicians or even Americans\u2019 self-indulgent visits to doctors and hospitals.\u201cI\u2019m just an immigrant, so maybe I am missing something about the curious American health care system,\u201d he would often say, recalling his childhood in Germany and flight to Canada and apologizing that English was only his second language.What propelled those prices most, he said, was a chaotic market that operates \u201cbehind a veil of secrecy.\u201dIt is also defined by the high cost of prescription drugs, he said, and the astronomical amounts that hospitals spend in dealing with a maze of insurers and health maintenance organizations.If the nation cut the cost of health care administration in half, he said, the savings would be enough to insure everyone.Professor Reinhardt\u2019s prescription for a more sensible system included imposing penalties on the uninsured so that people would not postpone buying policies until they got sick. That idea, the so-called individual mandate, requiring most people to purchase health insurance, became an integral component of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. Republicans in Congress are now seeking to repeal that provision as part of a tax overhaul.Professor Reinhardt also advocated providing government subsidies so that low-income families could afford mandated insurance, another feature of Obamacare.His ideal model was the German system in which insurers negotiate with health care providers to set common binding prices in a specific region.Always opinionated, Professor Reinhardt was also unsparing in inflicting his mordant wit on any self-satisfied expert he considered hypocritical or illogical.\u201cIt strikes me as a poor strategy,\u201d he added.With near unanimity, colleagues and admirers praised Professor Reinhardt for transforming raw data into moral imperatives.Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who advocates a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d national health care system, wrote in an email, \u201cUwe Reinhardt was one of the leaders in the effort to make health care a right, not a privilege.\u201dAnd Professor Elliott S. Fisher of Dartmouth called Professor Reinhardt \u201cin so many ways the conscience of the U.S. health care system.\u201dUwe (pronounced OO-vuh) Ernst Reinhardt was born on Sept. 24, 1937, in the city of Osnabr\u00fcck in northwest Germany. His father, Wilhelm, was a chemical engineer. His mother, the former Edeltraut Kehne, was a photographer and painter.He was raised near the Belgian border and the H\u00fcrtgen forest, where American and German soldiers engaged in hand-to-hand combat for three months in 1944.His exposure to the war so dismayed him that in the mid-1950s, at 18, rather than be drafted into the army and have to salute a German officer in the wake of \u201cthe unimaginable atrocities committed by Nazi Germany\u201d years earlier, his wife said, he left the country, setting off for Canada and leaving his parents and four siblings behind.He landed in Montreal with $90 in his pocket and no Canadian connections. Having had some apprentice training in shipping in Germany, he found work at a shipping company and worked nights parking cars in a parking lot. He always ate oatmeal for breakfast because it was cheap, his wife said, and to make extra money he routinely volunteered to work overtime for co-workers who had families.After three years, he had saved enough money to enroll, hundreds of miles away, at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, the cheapest university he knew of, Ms. Cheng said. (Selling his used Chevrolet and beloved guitar helped defray the costs.)He graduated with a bachelor of commerce degree and went on to Yale, where he received his doctorate. His thesis was titled \u201cAn Economic Analysis of Physicians\u2019 Practices.\u201dIn addition to Ms. Cheng, a health policy research analyst at Princeton who is known as May, he is survived by their children, Dirk, Kara and Mark Reinhardt; his sisters, Heide Cermin and Imeltraut Arndt; his brother, Jurgen; and two grandchildren.Professor Reinhardt joined the Princeton faculty in 1968 as an assistant professor. At his death, he was the James Madison professor of political economy and professor of economics and public affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School.\u201cHe was so inspired a teacher,\u201d said Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the research organization in Washington, \u201cthat he could make accounting the most popular course at Princeton.\u201d Among his students was Bill Frist, a surgeon and a former Republican Senate majority leader from Tennessee.In 2015, Professor Reinhardt humbly \u2014 and facetiously \u2014 announced that after reflecting on the global economic crisis that had occurred several years earlier, he was calling it quits.\u201cAfter the near-collapse of the world\u2019s financial system has shown that we economists really do not know how the world works, I am much too embarrassed to teach economics anymore,\u201d he wrote.In an interview not long before that, though, he belied any pretense of self-doubt when he was asked whether he was perplexed by the seemingly insolvable challenges of health care economics.\u201cHave you ever seen a perplexed economist?\u201d Professor Reinhardt replied. \u201cWe have an answer for everything.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to the hand-to-hand combat between American and German soldiers in 1944 in the H\u00fcrtgen forest, near where Professor Reinhardt was raised in Germany. It lasted about three months, not four.Margot Sanger-Katz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Friday 2017: Your Best Bargain Bet Might Be a TV", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the holiday shopping seasons begins in earnest over the Thanksgiving weekend, we\u2019re spread out over the United States, capturing what the deal-seeking rush looks like this year.\u2022 If you\u2019re suiting up to hit the stores, your best bet for a bargain might be a TV. Our tech columnist Brian Chen tells you what to look for.\u2022 A humming economy does not necessarily mean consumers are planning to open their wallets any wider than they did last year.\u2022 But that might be the best argument for bargain hunting. When will your favorite stores be open? There\u2019s a list below you can check. Twice.This weekend\u2019s Black Friday deals could make it possible to buy a high-quality TV at a big discount \u2014 15 percent to 30 percent, in some cases.That could be a huge bargain considering that most TVs in the $500 range are just O.K. while high-end models cost upward of $2,000.The key points: Know the lighting in the room where you\u2019ll put it, look for a couple important features, and don\u2019t get duped.At Walmart in Commack, N.Y., on Thursday, the route to the registers was winding.Jessica Polizzi, 18, a physical therapy student at New York Institute of Technology, pushed a cart through a maze of yellow tape and black barriers. As if trapped in a corn maze, Ms. Polizzi and her mother, Jane, and brother, Martin, 17, hit a dead end before a War-Mart employee redirected them.\u201cIt\u2019s like a haunted house,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think the point of that is to disorient you and scare you, so maybe this is the same tactic.\u201dThe Polizzis have been shopping on Thanksgiving night for the last few years.\u201cThanksgiving\u2019s so low-key for us, so this is what we look forward to,\u201d Jessica Polizzi said. \u201cWe have turkey, and then this is our evening activity.\u201dAlso in line was Mohit Mundra, 37, of Hauppauge; but for Mr. Mundra, the shopping trip was nothing special.But two questions loom over the holiday shopping season: How free will Americans be with their spending when wage growth remains anemic? And how much of that money will they spend in stores, given the continuing shift toward online shopping?\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that\u2019s bouncing around a lot,\u201d said Jon Cohen, vice president of survey research for SurveyMonkey. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t rushing to save money they way they were during the downturn.\u201dBut that confidence may not translate into booming holiday sales. Most Americans plan to spend the same on their holiday shopping as last year, or less, according to the survey; only 12 percent plan to spend more.Still, two-thirds of Americans plan to shop over the long Thanksgiving weekend, according to SurveyMonkey, and nearly a quarter plan to do all or most of their holiday shopping in that period.But the shift toward online retailers means that Black Friday is not the economic indicator that it once was. Retailers \u2014 both online and brick-and-mortar \u2014 are increasingly offering deals days or even weeks ahead of Thanksgiving, and consumers have learned that the best prices on some items come later in the holiday season.Your local Walmart is open now (it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, this is pretty much a given). Kmart and two big outdoors emporiums, Cabela\u2019s and Bass Pro Shops, were open this morning before you got the turkey in the oven.Other major retailers including Target, Best Buy and Kohl\u2019s have opted to wait until the late afternoon.One retailer that chose to stay closed on Thanksgiving? T-Mobile, which had opened last year. John Legere, the mobile carrier\u2019s chief executive, said he wanted everyone to \u201cgive thanks with family, friends and loved ones.\u201dThe best part is you don\u2019t have to get out of your chair to chase them down.There are suggestions at every price point, so it\u2019s a good resource if you\u2019re buying for a gift exchange at work or a loved one. After all, somebody in your life must need a kayak.Frustrations with online shopping with an slow internet connection drove some Iowa shoppers out of their homes on Thursday to find the best deals in person.In Eastern Iowa, broadband service is not yet ubiquitous. A 2016 report from the Federal Communications Commission found that 37 percent of rural Iowans lacked broadband access.Keshia Bolsinger, 31, a store manager for U.S. Cellular, is among them. In Garber, her tiny town in Clayton County, there is only one option for internet: DSL. When she turned to her iPhone to peruse Black Friday deals on Walmart.com, she ran into trouble.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really cooperating,\u201d Ms. Bolsinger said. \u201cIt started freezing and kicked me out.\u201dShe enlisted her mother to babysit her four children and adjusted the time of her Thanksgiving meal to allow her to drive to a Walmart in nearby Manchester.For Scott Miller, 44, a pet store operator in Manchester, shopping from the comfort of his couch is not an option: He does not have internet. He arranged to have his Thanksgiving meal at noon so he could leave his family and nab a 43\u201d Vizio HDTV for $197. He waited for three hours for the sale to begin.\u201cIt was boring,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cI just stood there, twiddling my fingers.\u201dAs broadband access here increases, that wait could vanish.Richard Larson, a professor at M.I.T. who has spent years studying line behavior \u2014 he\u2019s known as Dr. Queue in academic circles \u2014 said that the enthusiasm for Black Friday lines \u201cmakes sense, in some weird way.\u201dThe once-a-year lines are \u201cexhilarating,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re the kind you might tell your grandchildren about.\u201dThe scarcity of bargains means shoppers can enjoy a sense of accomplishment after braving the lines.\u201cPeople\u2019s willingness to wait is, in some sense, proportional to the perceived value of whatever they\u2019re waiting to acquire,\u201d Professor Larson said. \u201cEven if they don\u2019t know what the line is for, they reason that whatever\u2019s at the end of it must be fantastically valuable.\u201dThe Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade has been a holiday tradition for nearly a century, an annual reminder that one of the most recognizable names in retail is just the place to get the shopping season started.Macy\u2019s real estate holdings, from mall storefronts to grand buildings \u2014 most notably the Herald Square location that serves as the backdrop for the parade on TV \u2014 are worth more than the company\u2019s market value.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who\u2019d Gain From an Estate Tax Rollback: The 0.2 Percenters", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySupporters and critics of the Republican tax bills argue over their effect on middle-class Americans, but there is one group that everyone agrees would come out ahead: the millionaires and billionaires who have to reckon with the estate tax.Republicans want to shrink the numbers further. In the Senate\u2019s proposed tax bill, exempted income would temporarily double to $11 million per person \u2014 $22 million for a couple \u2014 during the next decade.Opponents of the tax say fairness is at stake. No one \u2014 including billionaires \u2014 should have their assets taxed twice, once in life and once in death, the argument goes. But the issue is less about double taxation than no taxation.In the past, a reduction in the estate tax was always coupled with a plan to end the protective shell that encases inherited capital gains and keeps them from being taxed.The Republicans\u2019 repeated success in whittling away at the number of people subject to the tax is both a marvel of marketing \u2014 with its relabeling as a \u201cdeath tax\u201d \u2014 and a testament to the outsize influence of wealthy donors on policy.Over the past couple of decades, Republican efforts to shield more prosperous Americans from the estate tax have been increasingly successful. In 2001, estates worth more than $675,000 (nearly $1 million in today\u2019s dollars) could be taxed at a top rate of 55 percent.Opponents of the tax have put a lot of money into fighting it over the years, without encountering much pushback, Mr. Graetz said, even from sectors that could be hurt by the change, like charitable organizations (since tax-deductible contributions are rendered less beneficial to rich donors) and insurance companies (whose policies become less essential to provide heirs with immediate liquidity or cash).The repeal effort is aided by the aspirations of dreamers and strivers who imagine that they, too, might reach the estate tax threshold by the time they die.There is still hardly any organized opposition, even though the Republican proposal \u201cbasically allows you to escape not only estate taxes but also income taxes,\u201d Mr. Graetz said.For the handful affected, the stakes are enormous, he said, but for everybody else, \u201cit\u2019s just another increase in the deficit, which doesn\u2019t seem to rally the public.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the top federal estate-tax rate under current law. It is 40 percent, not 39.6 percent, of the amount above $5.49 million.An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of a modification of the estate tax approved Thursday by the House of Representatives.

{"Headline": "He Promised Riches and Entry to Canada. Now He\u2019s the Subject of a Fraud Case in Vancouver.", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 In the tightly knit world of Vancouver\u2019s wealthy Chinese immigrants, Paul Se Hui Oei stood out for his ties to some of Canada\u2019s most powerful politicians and his mastery of cultivating guanxi, or personal relationships, that attracted legions of Chinese clients eager for his assistance in gaining a legal foothold in Canada.\u201cEverything he said were lies,\u201d said Chen Wei, a Chinese immigrant who testified earlier this year in a case against Mr. Oei before a British Columbia Securities Commission panel. Mr. Chen\u2019s family invested one million Canadian dollars ($782,000) in Mr. Oei\u2019s project, according to hearing transcripts.The case is part of a pattern, experts say, of problems with Canada\u2019s immigration programs, which, like the United States, set aside coveted residency permits for foreign investors. Some also say it underscores a troubling flaw in the Canadian justice system, which often allows white-collar criminals to walk away with little more than a slap on the wrist.Mr. Oei has denied the accusations, but even if he is found to have committed fraud, he will face financial penalties only, not prison time.Mr. Oei, who immigrated to Canada in the 1980s, declined interview requests through his lawyer.The case against Mr. Oei was brought by the commission, an independent provincial regulatory agency. The panel, appointed by the government, is expected to rule on the case this month. Apart from the financial penalties, Mr. Oei faces a possible ban from working in the securities industry.In Vancouver, Mr. Oei owned an immigration consulting and financial services company, and sought to use his connections in the Chinese community to raise money for a recycling start-up, Cascade.But the commission says that from 2009 to 2013, Mr. Oei told investors that the project was approved by the British Columbia government (it was not) and that their investments would give Chinese citizens the right to immigrate to Canada, as well as shower them with profits. All they had to do was transfer funds into the trust account of a local lawyer and member of the Canadian Parliament, Joe Peschisolido.\u201cThis made investors feel safe, and that their money would be safe,\u201d Mila Pivnenko, one of the commission lawyers, told the panel. \u201cOf course, Oei was the only person who directed the lawyer where to disburse the funds from the trust account.\u201dThe commission said Mr. Oei secretly transferred millions of dollars meant for the recycling company into his own bank accounts and issued shares in companies with no assets to investors in order to avoid detection.Mr. Oei raised about 13.3 million Canadian dollars ($10.5 million) from 64 investors, but the commission says he kept 6.9 million Canadian dollars for himself. When Cascade went bankrupt in 2013, Mr. Oei told many investors they could recoup their money if they topped up their investment, without alerting them that he had never sent more that half the funds he had already raised from investors to the project, the commission said.Jiang Yicheng, 53, a businessman from China\u2019s coastal Zhejiang Province, said in a phone interview that during several visits to Vancouver, Mr. Oei chauffeured him and other Chinese investors around in a BMW, hosted lavish meals and showed off photos of himself posing with Canadian elected officials.Mr. Jiang was sold. He formed a consortium of Chinese investors who transferred more than $3 million for the recycling company, convinced by Mr. Oei\u2019s promises that the project was backed by the government and would allow him to immigrate.Mr. Oei \u201ctook advantage of our trust to cheat us,\u201d said Mr. Jiang, who has also filed a lawsuit in British Columbia against Mr. Oei. Mr. Jiang said he himself was successfully sued by the members of his consortium to recover their losses, which has left him penniless.Richard Kurland, a former national chairman of the Canadian Bar Association\u2019s citizenship and immigration section, said lax oversight from the Canadian government and a preference for funding law-enforcement departments that investigate violent crime and terrorism rather than white-collar crime added to the difficulties in policing the immigration programs. \u201cWhite-collar crime is tolerated because it\u2019s not a priority,\u201d he said.In an email, Canada\u2019s Ministry of Finance said the task force\u2019s concerns will be reviewed by a parliamentary committee.In the meantime, those who say they were defrauded by Mr. Oei have seen their lives turned upside down. In his testimony, Yang Baoxi, a Chinese immigrant in Vancouver, said his wife made two suicide attempts after they lost $1.3 million to Mr. Oei\u2019s project.\u201cIn the last few years,\u201d he said, \u201cI have been living in nightmare.\u201dChristopher Buckley and Adam Wu contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Village Keeps Alive a Tradition of Indigo Dyeing", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDali Village JournalDALI VILLAGE, China \u2014 The young woman sat at the foot of the wooden loom and began to weave. As her fingers passed the orange shuttle back and forth through the delicate cotton threads, the creaky contraption sprang to life.Yang Xiuying \u2014 a plucky woman no taller than the loom \u2014 peered over her granddaughter\u2019s shoulder, inspecting the newly emerging fabric for flaws. Ever since she was a young girl, Ms. Yang, 74, has been weaving and dyeing indigo textiles using techniques that the ethnic Dong in the southern Chinese province of Guizhou have passed down from mother to daughter over generations.\u201cYou can\u2019t buy this type of handmade cloth at the market,\u201d Ms. Yang said, patting a bolt of gleaming indigo-colored cloth with her wrinkled, navy-stained hands.Here in Dali, an ancient village nestled in verdant hills, making indigo cloth has long been a part of life, no less important to the Dong than farming rice or fermenting fish.Even in this era of fast fashion, many Dong women still devote countless hours to making the dark, glossy cloth. The fabric must be woven, wrung, scrubbed and pounded before it can be used to create traditional Dong cotton garments \u2014 dark navy costumes with colorful flower trim for the women and plain indigo for the men.\u201cFor a Dong family, having a loom is just as important as having a cow,\u201d said Lai Lei, the founder of a weaving and dyeing co-op in a nearby village. \u201cAs children, we grow up listening to the sound of the loom.\u201dDyeing is so woven into Dali\u2019s culture that the practice even survived the Cultural Revolution, when many other Dong traditions, such as shamanism, were stamped out by Communist fanatics trying to destroy what they saw as a feudal past.But the traditions have come under a different threat since China\u2019s market economy took off in recent decades. As the lure of work and education has drawn youth to China\u2019s growing cities, few young Dong women are left in villages like this one.Of those who remain, even fewer show interest in learning the labor-intensive techniques of indigo dyeing.\u201cI want to teach my daughters, but they don\u2019t want to learn,\u201d said Zhang Yuyuan, 75, as she stepped back from plunging fabric into a navy-blue bath. \u201cThey say, \u2018We\u2019ll just mess it up, so you should just do it.\u2019\u201d\u201cFor a long time, Guizhou has known that one of its strongest cultural resources is the ethnic minority villages,\u201d said Kuanghan Li, the China program director of the Global Heritage Fund. \u201cNow rural villages are a hot topic in China.\u201dTourism has yet to take off in Dali, though it may only be a matter of time. Unlike many villages in China where preservation has been undertaken with a heavy hand, the village has the feel of an untouched oasis, due in part to its remote location.Even today, it is accessible only by a narrow mountain road that winds through lush bamboo forests before descending down into a valley where sloping gray-tiled rooftops huddle closely together.A recent visit to the village found the few hundred or so residents hard at work. Nearly every family grows its own rice and indigo, and both were ready for harvest.In the busy autumn mornings, it is the Dong women who wake first. The roosters were still asleep and the sky was dark when Yang Xiukui stepped outside to start her day\u2019s work. She folded a long length of indigo cloth and laid it onto a flat stone surface.Using a heavy wooden mallet, Ms. Yang, 55, began to pound the fabric. With each thump, the cloth grew brighter, acquiring a shiny gloss. That luster \u2014 achieved through the application of cowhide extract and, at times, egg whites \u2014 is prized by Dong women. When they wear their handmade indigo clothes for holidays and festivals, the women will inspect the sheen of one another\u2019s handiwork in the spirit of friendly competition.As Ms. Yang worked, a chorus of roosters joined the plinking of mallets to awaken the village. Sleepy children stumbled to school along stone-paved paths while older people kibitzed on doorsteps of traditional wooden homes.Ms. Yang brought the now-gleaming indigo cloth to a covered plastic tub in the corner of her still dark kitchen. She removed the lid, releasing a pungent, fermented odor. Inside was a dark blue, frothy liquid.Almost every Dong woman over 40 has a plastic tub to hold indigo dye bath. By tradition, the placement of the tub within the house is crucial, and must be made according to principles of feng shui, the ancient practice of arranging objects to improve one\u2019s luck.One year, Ms. Yang said, she placed the tub in another part of the house, not realizing it had bad feng shui. The dye \u2014 which is made from a mixture of indigo leaves, rice alcohol, wild plants and lye \u2014 was ruined, she said.Dong women believe that other factors can spoil the dye. Women who are pregnant or menstruating, for example, are expected to stay away. Ms. Li of the Global Heritage Fund recounted one time when it became apparent that a dye bath had been ruined because the cloth wasn\u2019t turning color.\u201cAll the women looked around at each other and just said, \u2018O.K., who here is pregnant?\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. Yang plunged the fabric into the dye bath, making sure to soak each section thoroughly. Several rounds of soaking and drip-drying later, she hung the heavy cloth on a wooden pole to dry. After a quick meal of chili fermented fish, saut\u00e9ed vegetables and rice, she hopped onto the back of her husband\u2019s motorbike and headed out for a full day of harvesting rice in the fields. It was only 9 a.m.The next morning, Ms. Yang repeated the entire process. In total, it takes Dong women about two weeks to color a single bolt of cloth into the desired rich shade of indigo.\u201cThey say whoever has the darkest stains on her hands makes the best cloth,\u201d Ms. Yang said proudly, as she held out her purple-streaked hands.Zoe Mou contributed research.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Pass Another Milestone, as Investors Remain Fearless", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the longest stock-market booms in history continued its gravity-defying ascent Thursday, with investors cheering the prospect of deep corporate tax cuts and the rollback of government regulations under President Trump.The Dow Jones industrial average eclipsed yet another milestone, closing Thursday above 24,000 for the first time. And the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index logged its 13th straight month of gains, the longest such streak in history.Stock markets have been going up, more or less without interruption, since March 2009, the end of the acute phase of the global financial crisis. This eight-and-a-half-year bull market is now the second-longest in history, behind only the rally that lasted from 1987 until 2000.Investors are embracing Mr. Trump\u2019s pro-corporate presidency, marked by the promise of lower taxes, the installation of former industry executives in key government agencies, and the repeal or relaxation of rules and regulations that have made it hard for some big businesses to expand without fear of interference from Washington.Indeed, the view is taking hold that Mr. Trump, in so aggressively promoting policies aimed to stoke the economy and financial markets, has unleashed animal spirits \u2014 largely absent under President Barack Obama \u2014 that are now reflected in ever rising consumer confidence indicators and a willingness to embrace risk in the stock market.\u201cIt comes down to psychology, and the psychology today is that everything is awesome,\u201d said Charlie Bilello, a stock market historian at Pension Partners. \u201cJobs have grown for 85 straight months, you have growth in corporate earnings, and you have tax cuts.\u201dMore than anything, enthusiasm about life being more pleasant for corporate America is propelling stocks. This week, investors were thrilled by the signs that a normally dysfunctional Washington is coalescing around a tax-cut package that would go straight to the bottom line of businesses and their owners.Of course, there is no guarantee the tax-cut package will become law. That is a potential tripwire for markets.\u201cIf the tax reform doesn\u2019t get done, I think there will be a pretty sharp correction,\u201d said Bruce Van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, one of the largest banking companies in the northeastern United States.Mr. Van Saun said stock markets could plunge as much as 15 percent if the tax cut was derailed in Congress. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite pivotal right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe businessperson has an expectation that this will get done.\u201dThese milestones, of course, are arbitrary. Passing a round number in a particular index isn\u2019t itself significant.But the ease with which the barrier was cleared highlights the extent to which investors are willing to look past geopolitical uncertainty and pricey stock valuations and bet that the market will keep going up.\u201cPeople are assuming this is normal \u2014 but it is not,\u201d Mr. Bilello said. \u201cThe relationship between risk and reward has broken down.\u201dIs this a bubble that\u2019s about to pop? Investment experts are divided.Skeptics point to the fact that many stocks, especially in the technology sector, are at historically high levels. Investors, they note, are relying on debt to amplify their returns. And a tulip-style mania has sent the price of the digital currency Bitcoin soaring.But even more investors are bullish. Sure, valuations are high, but in contrast to 2000, when Silicon Valley was littered with companies without business models, today\u2019s tech behemoths \u2014 including Facebook and Amazon \u2014 are fundamentally sound. And a round of tax cuts could further fatten corporate profits. As for Bitcoin, if it crashes there is no direct reason it should necessarily drag down stocks.Ed Yardeni, an independent stock market strategist, has identified 58 of these small market panics since 2009. This year, he has not seen a single one.\u201cThis is starting to feel like a melt-up,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said, describing a feverish state of a bull market when investors discard all fears. \u201cThe market has climbed a wall of worry, but now it seems as if there is nothing to worry about.\u201dThat, Mr. Yardeni said, is itself something to worry about, because investors are throwing caution to the wind.According to Mr. Bilello, the stock analyst, a typical year will include three or four stock market corrections. In 2017, there have been none. The worst swoon this year was a 3.3 percent fall between March 2 and April 19.Such a relentless \u2014 and smooth \u2014 rise in stocks is very unusual.Several unprecedented factors might be helping the rally, analysts say. For the first time ever, an American president is actively promoting a stock market surge. Mr. Trump has tweeted often about the stock market, including eight times this week alone.A president\u2019s boasting about the market doesn\u2019t mean it should keep going up. But at these high levels, psychology becomes a critical factor that can move stocks higher.That could mean your brother-in-law praising his portfolio at a cocktail party \u2014 or the president of the United States speaking more broadly to his 43 million followers on Twitter.It doesn\u2019t hurt that there has never been a time when the global economy has been growing so strongly while central banks kept interest rates so low.Traditionally, bull markets come to an end when, after a sustained period of growth, inflation forces central banks to raise rates.Now, with inflation stagnant and the lingering anxieties of the 2008 financial crisis fading, investors are not ready to contemplate the end of the party.For example, the latest missile scare from North Korea, after so many previous flare-ups, barely caused investors to bat an eyelid.\u201cI used to call my clients fully invested bears,\u201d said Mr. Yardeni, the investment strategist. \u201cNow they are giddy bulls \u2014 how could they not be?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prince Harry Casts Aside Ghosts of Royal Marriages Past", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisOnce upon a time, in 1936, a British monarch named Edward VIII was forbidden to marry his divorced American girlfriend and also be king, so he renounced the throne, moved with her to France and lived not-so-happily ever after.Nearly 20 years later, forced to make a similarly unpleasant choice, Edward\u2019s niece Margaret opted to keep her title but jettison her (also divorced) boyfriend. She ended up herself divorced from the man she married in the boyfriend\u2019s place.But that was another century, another world and many divorces ago.It is not a big deal because Prince Harry, 33, a former army officer with an earthy sense of humor who brings an element of edgy sex appeal to a family that could use a bit more of it, is only fifth in line to the throne. The only way he could plausibly become king is under some sort of \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d or \u201cKind Hearts and Coronets\u201d scenario involving his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth; his father, Prince Charles; his brother, Prince William; and William\u2019s young children, George and Charlotte.But the engagement is significant, in part as a frivolously welcome distraction at a time of unrelenting bad news about the economy, about Britain\u2019s painful \u201cBrexit\u201d from Europe and about Britain\u2019s place in the world. More than that, it is an example of openness and inclusivity in a country that is sorely divided over issues like race and immigration.Ms. Markle\u2019s father is white and her mother is African-American, and so with one heady announcement, it seems, Harry and Ms. Markle have thrown out generations\u2019 worth of quietly repressed tradition and presented a new royal model to a country that will have to adjust to it, whether it wants to or not.\u201cThe royal family and the standards they normally have \u2014 they want them to be white and not divorced,\u201d said Asha Duncan, 31, who works in fashion advertising and was strolling in Kensington on Monday. \u201cMaybe she will get them moving with the times more,\u201d she said of Ms. Markle, \u201cshowing we live in a multicultural society.\u201dVisiting from Boston, Trevor Gailun, who is 41 and works in finance, said the emergence of a royal American in London could be only a plus.\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting that we have an American woman,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is good for the royal family and also for the world to have a little bit more diversity.\u201dGet the Morning Briefing in your inbox. What you need to know to start your day, each weekday morning.Not only that, he said, but \u201cAmericans are celebrity obsessed, and I think having a pretty well-known actress now as a princess \u2014 it does not really get better than that.\u201dBut if you read carefully you might find veiled traces of the racism and class-based snobbery that last year spurred Prince Harry to issue a highly unusual statement of indignation on Ms. Markle\u2019s behalf.But there was The Daily Mail back at it on Monday, explicitly pointing out that most of Prince Harry\u2019s previous girlfriends had been blonde, and going out of its way to make Ms. Markle\u2019s family back home sound like a bunch of eccentrically inbred rednecks.\u201cThe extended Markle family is possibly the most unusual to marry into the House of Windsor so far,\u201d the paper said on its website. Her half brother, for instance, is newly engaged (to a woman named Darlene), \u201cdespite being arrested after pointing a gun at her during a drink-fueled argument,\u201d the article reported.Meanwhile, the conservative columnist Melanie McDonagh groused in The Spectator about Ms. Markle\u2019s left-leaning political views and unsuitability, as a divorc\u00e9e, to be married in the Church of England. \u201cObviously, 70 years ago, Meghan Markle would have been the kind of woman the prince would have had for a mistress, not a wife,\u201d she wrote.The paper\u2019s website was full of a range of comments reflecting a range of views: from readers who marveled at what this new development signifies for Britain and for themselves, from readers who hate the royal family and want it to go away, and from readers who do not care at all.\u201cI\u2019d love to agree with this,\u201d wrote a reader named \u201cNyder,\u201d \u201cbut I have to point out that the current royal family have German heritage and it hasn\u2019t exactly led to English people viewing the Germans as their kin.\u201dAnna Schaverien contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$1.5 Billion I.P.O. for Firm Controlled by Putin Ally Tied to Manafort", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Russian energy and aluminum company EN+, which is controlled by a member of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s circle of favored businessmen, said on Friday that it had raised $1.5 billion in an initial public offering seen as a major test of investors\u2019 appetite for Russian assets.The offering may draw attention for using the London Stock Exchange, where listing rules are less stringent than in New York, for a transaction that had the effect of funneling money to a Russian state bank that has faced sanctions in both the United States and the European Union, even though EN+ has not faced sanctions.The offering\u2019s prospectus said that EN+ intended to use $942 million out of the $1.5 billion it raised to pay down a loan from VTB Bank. The offering is intended, it said, to \u201crepay in full the loan provided to it by VTB.\u201dThe United States sanctioned the bank on July 29, 2014, 12 days after a civilian airliner was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, most of whom were Dutch citizens; safety investigators and Dutch prosecutors determined that a Russian antiaircraft missile had hit the plane.The sanctions prohibit Western companies from extending new long-term credit lines to VTB and other Russian banks, but allow loan repayments.Mr. Deripaska, an orphan from a small village in southern Russia, muscled his way into the aluminum business in Siberia in the 1990s. At the time, the industry was in bloody turmoil as organized crime figures and venal local officials fought in what became known as the Aluminum Wars.Despite his humble background, Mr. Deripaska is closely entwined with the Moscow elite. As an example of his proximity to power, analysts of the oligarchy have pointed out that he is married to the step-granddaughter of the late former Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin; Mr. Deripaska has played down the tie as irrelevant to his business activities.Mr. Deripaska was never charged with a crime in Russia over the Aluminum Wars, but the United States has for years denied him a visa, suggesting something unseemly in his ascent in the Siberian aluminum industry. It was in an effort to solve this earlier problem in Washington that a decade ago he reached out to a business partner of Mr. Manafort, Rick Davis, for lobbying.Mr. Manafort and Mr. Deripaska set up an investment company to buy television stations in Ukraine that eventually unraveled in a $19 million lawsuit filed by Mr. Deripaska in the Cayman Islands, court records show. But now, those decade-old ties to Mr. Manafort have become a focus of attention in the Trump-Russia investigation.Addressing concerns about Americans doing business with Kremlin insiders, the sanction law passed by Congress in August stipulates that American officials are to prepare a report on Russian oligarchs by early next year, identifying those deemed close to Mr. Putin for possible sanctions. It is not clear whether Mr. Deripaska is under consideration for inclusion on that list.The potential for new sanctions based on Kremlin ties, long important for survival and success in business in Russia, has the oligarchy on tenterhooks, said Alexey Makarkin, vice president of the Center for Political Technologies, a research institute in Moscow. \u201cThey see a potential threat,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of businessmen are very worried.\u201dStill, the EN+ offering is the latest sign of investors \u2014 while wary of sanctions \u2014 being attracted to Russian companies as the country\u2019s economy gains a firmer footing.EN+\u2019s offering, in particular, comes on the heels of a quiet inflow of foreign money into Russia\u2019s government bond market, where interest rates run about 8 percent. Nonresident investors, who owned only about 5 percent of government bonds at the start of the year, bulked up to to about 30 percent by the fall, an inflow of about $30 billion, according to Alexander Y. Abramov, a professor at the Higher School of Economics at Moscow\u2019s National Research University.\u201cThe budget is under control, the reserve funds are high,\u201d Mr. Abramov said. \u201cThe interest in Russia is in the relatively stable ruble, and no events can be seen in the near future to change that.\u201dEN+ is a producer of hydropower through EN+ Power and of aluminum through Rusal, in which it holds a 48.1 percent stake. EN+ reported revenue of $5.8 billion in the first half of this year. The stock offers investors a chance to own shares in the gigantic dams corralling the power of Siberian rivers like the Yenisei and Angara.The company said it had priced its offering at $14 per global depositary receipt, toward the bottom of its expected range. It said that the offering gave it a market value of $8 billion. Shares of EN+ were trading below the offer price, at $13.82 a share, in conditional trading in London on Friday. The company\u2019s shares are expected to begin trading in Moscow on Wednesday.The EN+ offering comes amid a relative low point in London\u2019s I.P.O. market. Though more money and more deals have been raised on the London Stock Exchange so far this year compared to all of last year \u2014 $5.9 billion has been raised in 25 transactions for the year to date \u2014 that remains far below the levels set in 2013 through 2015, according to data from Thomson Reuters.Despite any concerns about how Britain\u2019s pending exit from the European Union might affect London\u2019s attractions as a listing venue, the London Stock Exchange and the related AIM exchange remain Europe\u2019s busiest market for I.P.O.s.Citigroup, Credit Suisse, J. P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch International, SIB (Cyprus) Limited and VTB Capital acted as joint global coordinators on the EN+ offering.Mark Mazzetti and Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Plan Would Raise Taxes on Millions", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly half of all middle-class families would pay more in taxes in 2026 than they would under current rules if the proposed House tax bill became law, and about one-third would pay more in 2018, according to a New York Times analysis, a striking finding for a bill promoted as a middle-class tax cut.President Trump and congressional Republicans have pitched the plan unveiled last week as a tax cut for most Americans. But millions of middle-class families \u2014 particularly those with children \u2014 would see an immediate tax increase, averaging about $2,000. Among the hardest-hit under the plan would be some of the most vulnerable taxpayers: those with huge out-of-pocket medical expenses.By 2026, 45 percent of middle-class families would pay more than what they would under the existing tax system.The preliminary Times analysis found that, in 2018, the plan would cut taxes for about 68 percent of families in the middle class, broadly defined as those earning between two-thirds and twice the median household income, or between about $50,000 and $160,000 per year for a family of three. For most of those families, the cut would be about $1,300 in 2018. In order to focus on families, the analysis excluded individual filers and households headed by people 65 or older and is adjusted for the size of each household.The bill is likely to change significantly in coming days. On Monday evening, the House\u2019s tax-writing Ways and Means Committee began the formal process of reviewing the bill, which could involve dozens of amendments, some of them substantial. The bill, which the House could pass as early as this week, is likely to change further in the Senate, where procedural rules place practical limits on how much the plan can add to the federal deficit.The Times analysis looks at the direct effect of the tax changes on Americans\u2019 incomes and does not account for changes in economic growth that Republicans say will amplify the impact of the tax cut and deliver higher wages to Americans across the income spectrum. Economic models disagree about the size of those effects, but generally agree they would be smaller in the initial years after a bill was passed since the tax cuts would take a while to filter throughout the economy.Still, Republican leaders in Congress and the White House haven\u2019t just argued that the bill would have broader economic advantages. Rather, they have repeatedly described it as a tax cut for middle-class families.The Times analysis accounts for the differing financial situations of Americans who look relatively similar on paper. It shows significant differences in how \u201ctypical\u201d families might fare under the Republican bill.Consider, for example, a four-person family earning about $75,000 a year. There are nearly 150,000 such taxpayers in the United States, according to data from the Census Bureau. About two-thirds of them would benefit under the Republican tax plan, with their taxes falling by about $1,500 on average. But the other third\u2019s taxes would go up, by nearly $700 on average, and some would pay thousands of dollars more than under current law.The bill is devised to allow millions of Americans to simplify their tax returns \u2014 to file, as Republican leaders put it, \u201con a postcard.\u201d The plan would most likely simplify taxes for some taxpayers, who would choose to take advantage of the plan\u2019s more generous standard deduction. But the analysis suggests that among lower- and middle-class families, the greatest benefits of the bill flow to those taxpayers who already file simple returns and do not itemize their taxes.The millions losing out under the bill would largely be families with more complicated finances, who now generally itemize their deductions. The bill would eliminate many common and valuable tax deductions that, in some cases, would eliminate thousands of dollars in tax benefits. This would be particularly acute for taxpayers who deducted state and local income and property tax payments, interest on student loans, or the cost of health insurance for self-employed workers.The plan could be particularly costly for Americans facing large medical bills. Nearly nine million taxpayers collectively deducted about $84 billion in medical expenses from their taxes in 2015. The House bill would eliminate that deduction.Mark Mazur, the director of the independent Tax Policy Center, said any attempt to reform the tax system \u2014 as opposed to just a broad-based tax cut \u2014 would have winners and losers. But he noted that many of the provisions that would benefit middle-class taxpayers in the House bill were set to expire or lose value over time.\u201cYou could create a plan that just cut taxes for middle-class people,\u201d Mr. Mazur said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what this is.\u201dThe Times\u2019s figures are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data using a tax model from the Open Source Policy Center, a Washington research organization affiliated with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. The organization\u2019s model does not yet fully account for the tax bill\u2019s treatment of so-called pass-through income, which is business income that is taxed at the individual rate under current law. And because the analysis is based on publicly available data, not actual tax records, it may not capture all the intricacies of Americans\u2019 household finances.The source of the tax increases is rooted in the structure of the Republican bill. The plan would roughly double the size of the standard deduction, to $24,000 for married couples and $12,200 for individuals. That could yield a substantial tax cut for many middle- and lower-income families that now take the standard deduction, or whose itemized deductions amount to less than those thresholds.But the Republican plan would also eliminate many of the deductions now taken by millions of taxpayers.Its elimination of the deduction for medical expenses could hit some families particularly hard because medical bills can be so large, unpredictable and unavoidable. Of the roughly 6.5 million middle-class families whose taxes would rise in 2018 under the bill, about 800,000 took advantage of the medical expense provision, deducting more than $17,000 on average from their taxes. Nearly 200,000 middle-class families owed no income tax under the current law at least in part because the medical-expense exemption offset their taxable income.The Republican proposal would also be costly for many large families. That\u2019s because, in addition to raising the standard deduction, the plan would eliminate the so-called personal exemption, which lets most taxpayers deduct about $4,000 for every person in their household. The plan would replace the exemption with an expanded child tax credit, but that would fill only part of the gap for many families. Fewer than 40 percent of middle-class families with at least three children would receive a tax cut under the plan, compared with nearly 80 percent of families without children.Negotiations over the House bill are continuing, and details could change. In the Senate, Republicans such as Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah have pushed to expand the child tax credit further, a move that could mitigate many of the tax increases on middle-class families, but that would force leaders to find other sources of revenue to offset the change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Senators Want Answers on AT&T Negotiations", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood afternoon. Is the Justice Department under President Trump more willing to block mergers than previously thought? It may depend on the kind of transactions we\u2019re talking about. A group of senators sent a letter to the D.O.J. demanding answers as to whether President Trump is influencing the department\u2019s negotiations with AT&T. The latest developments in the tax overhaul remain on our minds, especially since the Senate is proposing delaying a cut to the corporate rate until 2019. More on all that in a moment.The senators continued:\u201cThese outstanding questions are especially concerning in light of yesterday\u2019s news reports. Multiple news sources have reported that the Department told the parties that they would need to divest CNN as a condition of completing the merger\u2026The President\u2019s views about the content of CNN\u2019s press coverage have no place in antitrust law enforcement. Should the Antitrust Division determine that AT&T\u2019s acquisition of CNN \u2013 as well as other Time Warner properties \u2013 raises antitrust concerns, Department enforcement action may be warranted. But political considerations based on the content of CNN\u2019s news coverage should never impact the Department\u2019s decision-making. Political interference in antitrust law enforcement is unacceptable. We hope that you share our views about the importance of maintaining the professionalism and independence of the antitrust enforcement agencies.\u201d\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinMany, many deal makers believed that a Trump presidency would be good for mergers within the media and telecom industries. Companies felt the need to get bigger, thanks to ever-increasing competition \u2014 and much of the inspiration came from AT&T\u2019s planned $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner. That was before this week.Think about how many deals are in the works, or that analysts say should be in the works. Sinclair is in the process of buying Tribune. Disney briefly held talks about buying most of 21st Century Fox. Sprint and T-Mobile are both single and potentially ready to mingle. And so on.Are Fox and Sinclair exempt? President Trump is a self-professed fan of all things Fox and personally close to Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch. We wonder if Fox tried to buy Time Warner again as they tried in 2014, could that deal actually be approved. Sinclair\u2019s news organization has also been quite supportive of President Trump. Does that facilitate a positive outcome to Sinclair\u2019s pending Tribune acquisition?The recent announcements about moderate Islam, the pervasive arrests, and the illusory hypermodern economic projects frame him as a ruthless modernizer, who is struggling to achieve too many things in too little time. But his motive is more about the consolidation of power than about corruption.Don\u2019t count on staying at the Ritz-Carlton anytime soonIn more Saudi newsBut some Republicans quietly say the loss of a few seats might be the price they have to pay for success to satisfy other constituents and business supporters hungry for a tax break.More tax notes____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London.____________________________Mr. Cohn also committed to staying in the administration, even though he was passed over for Federal Reserve chairman.Thirteen newsmakers joined us at the DealBook conference on Thursday, and many made news.

Is it, as some Trump critics suggest, an attack on a news outlet that the president has openly criticized? Or is it an attempt to break up a deal that has become a lightning rod for concerns about a rapidly consolidating media industry, perhaps rooted in the administration\u2019s populist tendencies?More food for thoughtMore accusations emerged yesterdayNot everyone is convinced that Wall Street firms will take over China, however, since state-run banks will remain powerful.\u201cGod only knows what it\u2019s doing to our children\u2019s brains.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Change on Mortgages Could Shake Up the Housing Market", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Republican tax plan unveiled on Thursday takes aim at the most sacred of cows: the provision that subsidizes homeownership by allowing the deduction of interest on mortgage debt.For most of America, the impact would be minimal. The proposed bill would make the interest deduction available on mortgage debt of up to $500,000 \u2014 half the current ceiling. But that is still more than double the median home price in the United States of roughly $200,000. Fewer than 3 percent of home mortgages are more than $500,000, according to data from CoreLogic.But if the idea holds \u2014 and history suggests that will be difficult \u2014 it will echo loudly through higher-priced cities on the coasts. \u201cThe impact on the market is going to be recognizable,\u201d said Ure R. Kretowicz, chief executive of Cornerstone Communities, a homebuilder in San Diego. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be less incentive to build, and less incentive to buy.\u201dTo understand the vast geographical disparities of the proposal, one need only look at home prices. In the Houston metropolitan area, about 6.5 percent of homes are valued at more than $500,000, according to Zillow. In San Jose, Calif., more than 90 percent are, and in San Diego, Calif., it is 63 percent.The proposed bill has no phase-in period; people who bought homes before Thursday could continue claiming the deduction on a mortgage up to $1 million, but after that, the ceiling is lowered by half. This will raise the overall cost of buying a home, and discourage existing homeowners from moving.On Thursday morning, hours after the proposal was unveiled, Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm based in Seattle, started drafting a memo to its more than 1,000 real estate agents instructing them to ensure that prospective home buyers can still afford homes in their desired price range.Many families would receive a tax cut, but the benefits would be mixed, and some would probably end up paying more.\u201cThere are people writing offers on homes today who have spent the past few days trying to figure out if they can afford a home, and we need to put them on notice that that might change,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, Redfin\u2019s chief executive.\u201cMight\u201d is the operative word here. Many economists from both parties have complained that the mortgage interest deduction is wasteful and unfair. It favors homeowners over renters, rich over poor, and distorts the housing market and even migration patterns by encouraging people to leave smaller urban quarters for bigger and more tax-advantaged homes in the suburbs.Even Mr. Kelman \u2014 a man whose fortunes are directly tied to commissions on homes bought and sold \u2014 said it could be hard to see the usefulness of a deduction that so forcefully favors one group over another.\u201cThe current tax code favors people who are buying a home versus the rest of America,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a captain of industry, I would prefer more tax breaks to help people buy houses, but as a citizen, I realize someone has to pay.\u201d\u201cWe are currently reviewing the details of the tax proposal released today, but at first glance it appears to confirm many of our biggest concerns\u201d about the tax plans making their way through Congress, the statement said. \u201cEliminating or nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and middle-class homeowners at risk, and from a cursory examination this legislation appears to do just that.\u201dEdward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who has long been in favor of reducing the mortgage interest deduction, liked parts of the plan. His main concern was that by retaining the existing deduction for current homeowners, the bill would further reduce the propensity of Americans to move \u2014 not just to a better or more expensive home, but also to cities or states where job opportunities might be brighter.\u201cThis effectively becomes a tax on selling a home,\u201d he said.To be sure, the tax proposal has a lot of variables that make it hard to determine exactly how it would affect any particular family\u2019s tax bill. For instance, the standard deduction would double, a factor that would partly offset the loss of the mortgage interest deduction. But the deductibility of property taxes would be capped at $10,000, another provision that could weigh on the construction and resale of more expensive homes.In any case, between the loss of the mortgage interest deduction and a separate measure to eliminate the deduction of state and local income taxes \u2014 something that would also disproportionately affect the higher-cost cities and states \u2014 the biggest losers will be most heavily concentrated on the coasts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Saudi Arabia, Where Family and State Are One, Arrests May Be Selective", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKing Salman\u2019s close relatives not only rule Saudi Arabia. They are also in business with it.A major Saudi investment firm founded by one of the king\u2019s sons, and now chaired by another, owns a significant stake in a conglomerate that does extensive government business, including in a shipbuilding partnership with a French defense contractor. A smaller firm founded by another of his sons says it invests in health care, telecommunications, education and other regulated or state-funded fields.None of that apparent conflict of interest seems to be against the law.But now their brother, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is leading a sweeping crackdown against what he has labeled \u201ccorruption\u201d that has swept up at least 11 princes from the House of Saud. But his immediate family\u2019s complicated and mostly undisclosed business interests are raising questions about what that accusation means in a kingdom where the law has so far included little or no regulation of what other countries have labeled and outlawed as self-dealing.The kingdom, an absolute monarchy, has also never attempted to create an independent court system to adjudicate claims. And if corruption is defined as private profit at the public expense, the practice is so pervasive that any measures short of revolutionary change may appear to be selective prosecution.\u201cIt is straight out of the autocrat\u2019s playbook,\u201d said Katherine Dixon, a researcher at Transparency International who has studied the Saudi defense industry. \u201cUsing state resources for your own ends is still O.K. if you are part of the right faction or clique, but because corruption is what people care about, it is used as a public rallying cry to justify a crackdown.\u201dShe and others compared Prince Mohammed\u2019s campaign to anti-corruption drives by President Xi Jinping in China or President Vladimir V. Putin in Russia, where prosecutions are often politically motivated.The Saudi Council of Ministers said Tuesday that all arrests were \u201cbased on specific evidence of criminality and acts that were intended criminal transgressions and resulted in unlawful gain.\u201d\u201cThe rights of the accused and the facts relating to the offenses are protected by law at all stages during the investigation and judicial process,\u201d the council added.\u201cUltimately, the king and some high members of the royal family can do what they want and make it legal later,\u201d he said, and the lack of regulation over royal self-dealing \u201copens the door wide to what would be considered corruption in other systems.\u201dMany Saudis appear to have applauded the crackdown. Two-thirds are under 30, many are frustrated by high unemployment, and some may take a certain satisfaction at even an arbitrary comeuppance for so many of the rich and powerful.Some cases may be clear-cut.One area that the official Saudi media say Prince Mohammed intends to investigate is flooding in the city of Jidda that killed more than 100 people in 2009. In that case, a Saudi businessman was accused of absconding with millions of dollars allocated for a Jidda sewage system and never installing any pipes.Beyond that case, only a few anonymously sourced reports of the potential charges have emerged. A professionally coordinated social media campaign, which appears to be organized by the government, has accused the most important prisoner, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the former chief of the national guard and a son of the previous king, of enriching himself at public expense by diverting funds from the national guard. Citing unnamed sources, news reports have suggested that he would be accused of hiring ghost employees and paying inflated contracts to companies he owned for equipment like walkie-talkies and bulletproof military gear.His brother, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, the former governor of Riyadh, will reportedly be accused of paying inflated contracts to companies he owned for a subway under construction in the capital.But in a country named for its ruling family, the line between public and private money can be hard to discern.The memo, disclosed in the trove of State Department documents released by WikiLeaks seven years ago, provided a detailed blueprint of the varied ways that money flows to members of the royal family either from state coffers or through private business in an otherwise opaque system.An embassy official received an unprecedented glimpse into royal finances when he visited the Ministry of Finance Office of Decisions and Rules in 1996, where servants came to pick up stipends for their royal masters. Sons of the founding king received as much as $270,000 a month, while a great-great-grandchild collected $8,000 a month. On top of those payments, bonuses of $1 million to $3 million were handed out to, say, construct a palace.Princes were known for borrowing money and simply never paying it back, which nearly led to the collapse of the National Commercial Bank. Royals were also known to act as the exclusive agents for foreign companies in the kingdom. When they founded their own businesses, they often relied on either government spending or state subsidies.\u201cIn other countries we talk about petty bribes,\u201d said Ms. Dixon of Transparency International. \u201cIn Saudi Arabia, it is theft on a grand scale.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In India, Fashion Has Become a Nationalist Cause", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVARANASI, India \u2014 Over the last two decades luxury brands have eyed India\u2019s fast-moving economy, booming middle class and youthful population, already among the world\u2019s largest, hoping they had discovered their next big market. But it wasn\u2019t to be.Along with India\u2019s protectionist policies (talks with the European Union on a free-trade agreement have been stalled since 2007), the rise of Hindu nationalist politics has become a major obstacle to realizing the country\u2019s promise of growth.Since the Bharatiya Janata Party formed a national government in 2014, the Indian fashion industry has been pressed to aggressively promote traditional attire and bypass Western styles. The effort aligns with the party\u2019s broader political program: to project multi-faith India, a country of more than 1.3 billion, as a Hindu nation.Fashion, and how Indians think of it, has not been exempt. Mr. Modi has made traditional dress a priority and, as many in the country want to please him, the fashion industry has followed along.And in August 2015, Ms. Chudasama introduced what she called the Banarasi Textiles Revival Movement at a fashion exhibition in Mumbai.The exhibition, which brought together the work of some of the country\u2019s leading fashion designers including Anita Dongre and Manish Malhotra, was organized in collaboration with the Ministry of Textiles and intended to promote the Banarasi sari, the traditional garment known for its fine silk and opulent embroidery \u2014 and primarily worn by Hindu women. Since then, there have been frequent state-sponsored fashion shows and exhibitions, most recently the \u201cSymphony of Weaves,\u201d a fashion showcase for the country\u2019s textiles, held in July in Gujarat, all with the aim of promoting traditional Indian clothing styles.India\u2019s leaders have always made political use of traditional clothing, from Mohandas K. Gandhi\u2019s adoption of the dhoti to Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s jacket. But active state intervention and patronage of the fashion industry have never before reached this scale.\u201cA subtle current of Indianizing the fashion was already there, but now, with the government\u2019s backing, it has gained a new momentum,\u201d said David Abraham, one of the country\u2019s leading designers and the creative director of Abraham & Thakore, the New Delhi-based fashion label.The Banarasi sari is woven in the northern Indian city of Varanasi, formerly called Benares or Banaras, which happens to be Mr. Modi\u2019s political constituency. It is also one of the holiest cities for Hindus, who consider it the eternal home of Lord Shiva, the Supreme God.During his campaign, Mr. Modi had promised to revive the tradition of the Banarasi sari and to help its weavers, a significant percentage of the constituency\u2019s electorate. The weavers, who are mostly Muslim and following a family trade, largely live in poverty.In late October, I visited Varanasi to learn whether anything had changed in the three years since Mr. Modi came to power.Mohammad Bashir, a wiry middle-age man who was my guide, led me through the narrow alleys of Saraiya, a village about 10 miles from the city. There were open drains clogged with thick black sewage, and half-dressed children played nearby.As soon as we reached what looked like a community center, about 50 men, old and young, gathered around. A few told their stories on behalf of the group: Nothing had changed for them.\u201cWe can\u2019t send our children to school,\u201d said Mohammad Yusuf, who, in his mid-50s, was one of the older weavers. \u201cThe fee is too much. Each family earns about 100 rupees to 125 rupees a day,\u201d or $1.55 to $1.95.But Mr. Modi\u2019s call to revive the Banarasi sari certainly has benefited the merchants in the city, who employ the weavers. \u201cThe demand for the luxury sari has gone up,\u201d said Hemang Agrawal, creative director of the Surekha Group and a businessman based in Varanasi.The project of Indianizing popular fashion is now in the hands of the country\u2019s textile minister, Smriti Irani, who was appointed in July 2016.The government\u2019s aim certainly has been to produce a popular fashion aesthetic that matches the broader political program of Hindu nationalism. But the world is more open to cultural change than it ever has been before, so will that effort ultimately succeed?Only time will tell.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After 20 Years of Financial Turmoil, a Columnist\u2019s Last Shot", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameFor the past 20 years or so, as a business columnist for The New York Times, I\u2019ve had a front-row seat for bull and bear markets, scandals, crises and management mischief.But I am leaving The Times, and this is my last shot at Fair Game. So it seems a fitting moment to look back at what\u2019s changed and what hasn\u2019t in the financial world, for better or worse.In addition to a string of garden-variety banking and business scandals, four seismic financial events occurred during my time as a columnist: the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998, the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000, the accounting scandals of Enron in 2001 and WorldCom in 2002, and the mother of them all \u2014 the mortgage debacle \u2014 in 2008. That one brought world economies to the precipice and wiped out Lehman Brothers and a raft of troubled banks.That many episodes of financial tumult in two decades seem like a lot.Some of this turmoil has generated positive change. Accounting scandals, for example, have been much rarer since Enron and WorldCom shook the financial markets. One reason: a 2002 federal law, known as Sarbanes-Oxley, requiring top executives to attest to the accuracy of their companies\u2019 financial statements.It\u2019s too bad that the mortgage crisis six years later didn\u2019t result in heightened accountability.Here\u2019s another sign of progress: Believe it or not, corporate directors are more active in their oversight than they used to be. Egregious board practices and chummy appointments are less common.\u201cWhen I started in this field, O. J. Simpson was on five boards, including the audit committee of Infinity Broadcasting,\u201d she recalled in an interview. \u201cAnd at another company, the C.E.O.\u2019s father was on the compensation committee. We\u2019ve come a long way.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say that problems arising from sleepy and clubby boards have been eradicated. \u201cExhibit A is executive compensation,\u201d Ms. Minow said. \u201cThe first C.E.O. pay package I ever complained about was $11 million. The very fact that that has gone completely berserk shows that boards are still a long way from where they should be.\u201dSomething else that hasn\u2019t changed over the decades is analyst and investor reliance on companies\u2019 creative earnings calculations. These figures, which do not conform to generally accepted accounting practices, typically exclude costs that companies incur in their operations. Such costs include stock awards given to executives and employees and merger expenses. Excluding them makes a company\u2019s results look more dazzling than they otherwise would.\u201cI find it ironic that GAAP is much better than it has been for a long time, but analysts have more disdain for it,\u201d Mr. Ciesielski said, referring to generally accepted accounting principles. \u201cThey blindly accept the methodology that management gives them. Folks prefer darkness, I guess.\u201dTo be sure, embracing management\u2019s preferred financial figures isn\u2019t as perilous when stock prices are rocketing. Bull markets cover a multitude of sins, after all. But as the dot-com episode showed, genuine earnings growth \u2014 the kind companies can take to the bank \u2014 becomes a crucial underpinning when share prices turn down. That\u2019s not true with financial metrics that can only be characterized as \u201cearnings before the bad stuff.\u201dMy search for truths on Wall Street and elsewhere over the years has sometimes raised hackles. That\u2019s to the good. It wasn\u2019t my job to be part of a company\u2019s spin machine.But responses from my subjects could get a little kooky. A favorite example occurred in the early 2000s, and it involved a major Wall Street firm.I had written about an arbitration case that an investor client had brought against the firm. The firm prevailed in the matter, and the general counsel convened a dinner to celebrate.In a phone conversation, the firm\u2019s general counsel told me that the menu for the dinner had featured a photograph of me, placed inside a red circle with a slash though it. The general counsel told me how he had scoured the web for just the right picture. The menu garnered lots of laughs from the attendees, he added.I never did find out what that celebration cost the firm\u2019s shareholders.Incidents like that, however, were relatively rare. And they were far outweighed by the appreciation that readers expressed.\u201cYou must continue your work of skewering people and customs in our capitalist society that abuse the process,\u201d a reader in Jackson, Miss., wrote in 2001. Others expressed thanks for my being \u201ca good and consistent questioner,\u201d for writing for the \u201cfinancially illiterate,\u201d for pushing to make the rules for investing fair and firm.And I loved receiving a Christmas card from a reader in Maryland a couple of years ago that simply said: \u201cThank you for telling truth!\u201dBelieve me, it has been my privilege.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Good Citizen Jailed in Turkey", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 The ever-expanding crackdown by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey against real and perceived enemies has reached outlandish levels.As teenagers in Istanbul, Mr. Kavala and I were schoolmates. He distinguished himself at school with an interest in social causes and exuded an infectious enthusiasm about the possibility of making things better.That is what Turkey has become under Mr. Erdogan\u2019s harsh rule. The country\u2019s creative and innovative minds are under constant threat from a regime that rewards only loyalty and tolerates little independence. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s professed targets are the adherents of Mr. Gulen. Tens of thousands have been purged from their jobs or imprisoned on suspicion of Gulenist ties, with little due process. But as in Mr. Kavala\u2019s case, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s sweep knows no boundaries.Mr. Erdogan is reviled by the opposition \u2014 secularists as well as many members of religious and ethnic minorities such as the Alevis and Kurds \u2014 but he is lionized in the conservative Sunni heartland of the country.He narrowly won a constitutional referendum in April that has greatly increased the powers of the presidency. The slim victory may have been an even worse outcome for the country than his winning by a large margin. The president appears to have concluded that he can cling on to power only through repression.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s strategy is to divide Turkey so he can maintain the firm support of half of the population. Keeping the country on alert against perceived foreign enemies and inflaming nationalist-religious passions serve to mobilize his base. That also neutralizes the main opposition parties, which are all highly nationalistic. These parties are unlikely to show much love for Europe or the United States and they also constitute reliable allies in the war against the Kurdish rebels.Someone like Mr. Kavala becomes a target precisely because he represents everything that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s regime is trying to obliterate: a thriving and independent civil society, tolerance for intellectual diversity, cultural autonomy for Kurds and other minorities, cooperation with nongovernmental networks abroad.Dani Rodrik is a professor of international political economy at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Seasonal Business Means Year-Round Work, but a Smaller Profit Window", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersJames Albis cannot wait for it to snow \u2014 messy, heavy, hard-to-drive-through snow. He probably wants it to snow more than just about anyone but a small child eager to have a day off from school. Without lots of snow, his technology start-up, SnoHub, which he has called \u201cthe Uber of snowplowing,\u201d could suffer.Last year, there were two major snowstorms in southern Connecticut, where Mr. Albis tested his app, which connects homeowners with snow-filled driveways to a roving band of snowplows. He said the app had been downloaded 1,000 times and the company brought in $25,000 that winter.In the off-season, the company expanded north to Boston and south to Philadelphia by contracting with more snowplow drivers. In a traditional business, this would be a sign that a company was poised for growth. But with SnoHub, all the preparation could be for naught if the snow does not fall.Entrepreneurs with seasonal businesses are a different breed of business owner. Their days are filled with all of the rush and anxiety of a typical business owner, but the time to make a majority of their revenue \u2014 upward of 70 percent \u2014 is compressed into a few months.Fluctuations in seasonal employment \u2014 and by extension, seasonal business activity \u2014 are well tracked in the labor market, which is why monthly job numbers are seasonally adjusted, removing the peaks and valleys in the economic cycle.But when those figures are not adjusted, the raw data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that businesses increase hiring and business activity two times a year, in the summer with a peak in June and for the holidays, cresting in November. Regardless of how the broader economy is faring, January is always a low point for business activity.But knowing what the statistics say and managing a business with a small window for profit are two different things. There is little margin for error. Here are some tips from small-business owners who depend on the seasons.Preparation is key.Helen Yarmak, a high-end fur designer, said her selling season stretched from a few weeks before Thanksgiving to Valentine\u2019s Day. To get clients interested in her new designs, she invites them to her studio in Milan during the summer.But with her business, much of the preparation is based on the availability of top pelts. For example, she said she spent years buying the 80 sable pelts that went into a single coat, which she is selling for 450,000 euros (about $528,000).\u201cIt can take a long time to collect sables,\u201d she said.\u201cWe prepare for things that are staples, but every year, there are going to be different things that are popular,\u201d Mr. Masters said.That\u2019s where adaptability comes in. They make or order products during the off-season, Mr. Masters, but they are careful not to order too much of anything new.\u201cIn July, we try to catch on to a trend,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be really careful about how we see the trends.\u201dAdapt to clients.At risk in missing a trend, of course, is the financial viability of the store. That adaptability can mean accommodating a client outside of normal business hours.Kenneth Mark, a dermatologist, has offices in the Hamptons and Manhattan. But a decade ago, he got his medical license in Colorado and opened a winter office in Aspen. Many of his well-heeled clients vacation in Aspen, but he opened the seasonal business for personal reasons: his love of skiing.Dr. Mark spends one week a month in Aspen from December to April, he said. But that means he has to accommodate clients in the New York area \u2014 or in Aspen \u2014 if they call at the last minute.\u201cI can\u2019t say, I\u2019ll see you next week,\u2019 if I\u2019m not around,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy or as glamorous as it sounds. I\u2019m working every single day I\u2019m out there.\u201dLess than a quarter of his income comes from his Aspen practice, but he said it had helped him to expand his medical practice. Clients from Aspen come to see him in New York in the summer. And being on the slopes has helped market his presence, he said.\u201cI could be skiing down a run under the gondola and people could be yelling down, \u2018Hey Dr. Kenny, I need Botox,\u2019\u201d he said.Not all businesses can move from one location to another. With SnoHub, Mr. Albis is bound by season, so he puts a premium on accommodating clients.When something goes wrong, like a truck knocking down a mailbox, he does not want customers to worry that the plow driver won\u2019t pay for damages. \u201cWe control the purse, so we can hold back payment for them for seven days,\u201d he said. \u201cThat provides a lot more reassurance for the homeowners.\u201dHe created the app to tell users how far away their driver was and how much it would cost, based on the length of the driveway and the depth of the snow.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the customer focused on convenience,\u201d he said. To that end, homeowners are sent before-and-after photos so they know the job was done.Hire year-round employees. Each weekend is focused on a group \u2014 young professionals, entrepreneurs and investors, and even fans of the filmmaker John Waters \u2014 and he has developed a loyal following. But he struggles with hiring people who can advance his brand.\u201cEvery year, it\u2019s starting from scratch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find staff who are wiling to work six months on, six months off.\u201dHis solution is to have a year-round staff of about a dozen who can continue to sell camp weekends in the off-season and train new employees in the spring.Enjoy the off-season.She charges $4,500 for a year for services that include taking a child to see a doctor or to buy a new iPhone. The business gives her summers off, which she wanted to spend with her son.The off-season for most of these businesses is a time to regroup. But certain businesses get another blip of activity, which helps with any business\u2019s big concern: cash flow.Mr. Masters said he and his mother were getting ready for the Christmas Stroll, which happens on Nantucket the first weekend in December. \u201cAnyone who lives on Nantucket during the summer, they all come back for one last hurrah,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could make more on that weekend than the entirety of October and November.\u201dMr. Schreiber said he was planning a ski-themed Club Getaway weekend at Mount Snow, a resort in Vermont, for January. Typically, 100 people go, compared with 300 for a summer weekend.\u201cIt\u2019s not that profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it really helps with cash flow.\u201dAnd managing cash flow is the key to these businesses living to see another season.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Promotes Deals in China, but Hints at Long Trade Fight Ahead", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 President Trump\u2019s $250 billion in Chinese business deals probably won\u2019t be enough to stop a trade fight.Mr. Trump met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on Thursday, offering personal praise and qualified criticisms of China\u2019s trade practices. China, in return, offered modest concessions on some thorny trade issues. The two sides also pointed to what they claimed were billions of dollars of deals between Chinese and American companies to show face-saving progress.Mr. Trump hinted at coming tensions on those fronts on Thursday, saying he hoped to address \u201cthe chronic imbalance in our relationship as it pertains to trade.\u201d\u201cThis includes addressing China\u2019s market access restrictions and technology transfer requirements,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich prevent American companies from being able to fairly compete within China.\u201dBoth countries face pressure to show their reasonable sides ahead of what could be a difficult fight.Mr. Trump made harsh criticism of trade with China a centerpiece of his campaign for president and faces pressure to deliver on promises to level the playing field and close the yawning American trade deficit with China. At the same time, he is seeking China\u2019s help containing North Korea, and on other issues.Mr. Trump struck a somewhat more conciliatory tone in front of his Chinese hosts. While China\u2019s trade practices are unfair, he said, that stemmed mainly from what he called the failings of his predecessors.\u201cRight now, unfortunately, it is a very unfair and one-sided one,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the two countries\u2019 trading relationship. \u201cBut I don\u2019t blame China, after all. Who can blame a country for taking advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens?\u201dThe two sides took pains on Thursday to show common ground. The Chinese government announced near the end of Mr. Trump\u2019s visit that it planned to reduce tariffs on imported cars and to open up its financial sector to greater competition. But Chinese officials offered no promises on when or how much they might be willing to move on either issue.But the Trump administration\u2019s negotiators made little attempt during the visit to seek such industry-specific promises, believing that previous efforts had resulted in little progress.Instead, Mr. Trump oversaw on Thursday the signing of more than $250 billion in largely symbolic business deals.Most of them appeared to be the kinds of deals that American companies have long struck in China.Trump administration officials and some business executives said the deals would not have occurred without Mr. Trump\u2019s visit. \u201cThis event helped make this one happen,\u201d said Mitch Snyder, the president and chief executive of Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron, which signed an agreement on Wednesday to deliver 50 five-person Bell 505 light-duty civilian helicopters built in Texas. He declined to disclose a price.Errol D. Rice, the executive vice president and managing director of the Montana Stockgrowers Association, said that a $300 million beef deal signed on Wednesday with JD.com, a Chinese electronic commerce company, had happened only in the last few weeks. The Chinese ambassador to the United States had expressed interest in September, he said, and within three weeks JD.com was negotiating to buy $200 million worth of Montana beef over the next three years and to build a $100 million beef-processing facility in southern Montana.One new agreement involved Alaskan natural gas. The state of Alaska signed a deal with Sinopec, a Chinese oil giant, and Chinese banks for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from near the North Slope of Alaska to a port, and for the construction of a liquefied natural gas loading terminal. China would then buy much of the gas, in a deal that American officials said could be worth $40 billion or more in the coming years.But the agreement fell short of a deal.\u201cWe are really positive about this project, but what we are going to sign this time is a letter of intent for mutual cooperation, not a contract,\u201d said Lu Dapeng, the press office director of Sinopec. \u201cThe area definitely has the resources, but it still requires extensive research and analysis to determine how big is the market and then to decide on the scale of the final cooperation accordingly.\u201d\u201cThis needs time,\u201d Mr. Lu added.Carolyn Zhang in Shanghai contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Politics Shadow Arrests of Citgo Executives in Venezuela Graft Inquiry", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 The administration of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro called it a necessary move to ferret out \u201cputrid\u201d corruption and end impunity. Outside the government, however, many observers saw it as yet another strong-arm move by Mr. Maduro to consolidate power.Whatever the motivation, the arrests this week of six senior executives at Citgo, the United States refining subsidiary of Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, have purged the American company\u2019s leadership and stunned the energy sector.The move, announced on Tuesday by Venezuela\u2019s attorney general, was the latest in an inquiry that has led to the arrests in recent months of about 50 people associated with the vital national oil industry. The purge has come as the state-owned company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, teeters on the brink of default on billions of dollars in bond debt amid the nation\u2019s worsening economic crisis.Attorney General Tarek William Saab said the six Citgo executives, including the acting president, faced charges of embezzlement and other crimes in connection with a refinancing deal worth as much as $4 billion that had not been authorized by the appropriate authorities in the Maduro administration. He said the officials had offered the subsidiary as a guarantee, putting it \u201cat risk.\u201dThe deal, he insisted, amounted to \u201ccorruption of the most putrid kind.\u201dCorruption has been a chronic and well-known problem for years at Pdvsa and has helped to undercut its operations and profits.But speculation abounded on Wednesday \u2014 among political analysts, oil industry executives and members of Venezuela\u2019s political opposition \u2014 as to whether the latest round of arrests, along with the dozens of others in the past few months, were mostly a high-profile effort by Mr. Maduro to reinforce his power on the cusp of a presidential election year.\u201cMy perception is that Maduro feels very strong,\u201d said Dimitris Pantoulas, a political consultant in Caracas, listing a number of the president\u2019s achievements this year, including his party\u2019s domination of regional elections, which helped to neutralize the opposition. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment to show to the public that he\u2019s a good leader and can even go against the people in his own party.\u201dMr. Pantoulas said the purge brought to mind recent events in Saudi Arabia, where the crown prince ordered the arrest of dozens of the kingdom\u2019s elite in a move that opponents called a political shake-up in the guise of a corruption investigation.Risa Grais-Targow, director of Latin America research at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said that internal rivalries in the Maduro administration had grown more intense as factions had to compete for declining revenue from the oil sector, the foundation of the Venezuelan economy.\u201cAs that pie shrinks, there is just less to go around, so you see a power play over who gets to control those resources,\u201d she said.Many of those Pdvsa managers arrested in recent months were seen as close to Rafael Ram\u00edrez, a former energy minister and head of Pdvsa. While Mr. Ram\u00edrez has served as Mr. Maduro\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations since 2014, analysts say that tensions between them are deep and longstanding: They were rivals to succeed President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.Mr. Ram\u00edrez has displayed some defensiveness in recent days on his Twitter account, writing on Monday, \u201cThose who attack me should think a little, just a little, because Chavez had me at his side for 12 years.\u201dA close associate of Mr. Ram\u00edrez was arrested last month in Spain as part of a bribery and money laundering investigation by the United States Homeland Security Department. The associate, Rafael Reiter, a former chief of Pdvsa\u2019s corporate security, was one of four former officials who have been investigated by American prosecutors as part of a broadening inquiry of Pdvsa stemming from allegedly fraudulent contracts dispensed for bribes.But Francisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan energy expert at Rice University, said that the latest round of arrests included people who were also close to the current Pdvsa chief, Nelson Mart\u00ednez, who served as the head of Citgo at the beginning of the year and is close to Mr. Maduro.\u201cHow can they be negotiating a loan without the direct knowledge of Nelson Mart\u00ednez?\u201d Mr. Monaldi wondered. \u201cYou have corruption everywhere, but clearly only a few are targeted. Why did this happen now? It\u2019s hard to understand.\u201dWhile the opaqueness of the Maduro administration left many scratching their heads over the latest arrests, there was some consensus that the move, coupled with the departure of many managers through firings or indictments in recent years, had gutted the company of much of its experienced talent at the very moment when it needs all it can get.Since early November, Pdvsa has been effectively in default on its $26.5 billion in unsecured bonds, and it faces claims of $60 billion in missed payments from its contractors and service companies that drill and maintain its fields.Trump administration sanctions imposed in August limit the ability of American financial institutions to loan money to Pdvsa, and prohibit Citgo from sending dividends back to Caracas.And with its oil fields losing pressure, critical equipment at its ports and processing plants in disrepair, and bondholders poised to seize its considerable foreign assets, there seems to be little room for recovery.With the largest oil reserves in the world, Venezuela was once one of the prime producers in the world, and a leader in OPEC. But it now produces only 1.9 million barrels a day, down from 2.4 million barrels a year ago, and down from the 3.2 million barrels it produced when Mr. Ch\u00e1vez took power nearly two decades ago. Production is falling by 20,000 barrels a day month after month, with the company in a death spiral.Pdvsa still accounts for nearly all the country\u2019s export earnings, roughly half of government revenues and about a quarter of the shrinking gross domestic product. Pdvsa has also been an important foreign policy arm of the government, by sending large volumes of cheap oil to China, Cuba, Nicaragua and other countries.Citgo has been a relatively bright light in a terribly dark landscape for the company, continuing to earn money even though its profitability has declined.Mr. Monaldi said the Maduro administration \u201chas been pragmatic enough to leave Citgo pretty much out of the politics of Venezuela.\u201dThat strategy may have ended this week.Kirk Semple reported from Caracas, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Advertisement"}

But not all citizens are created equal: A 35-year-old congressional budget cap on Puerto Rico\u2019s food stamp program has limited the amount of disaster aid immediately available. Texas and Florida have no such federal restraints and were able to quickly increase food stamp help in the face of the hurricane damage last summer.It is hard to argue with Puerto Rican officials pointing to the disparity as painful evidence of a colonial second-class status suffered by citizens of this American territory, citizens who lack political clout, voting representation in Congress or a say in who\u2019s in the White House.Food stamp aid was particularly needed in the weeks right after the disaster. But Puerto Rican officials were hobbled in offering emergency increases both to needy families already receiving aid and to others plunged into temporary need by the hurricane\u2019s destruction. Unlike the states, the island cannot resort to the disaster relief section of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u2014 the formal name of the food stamp program \u2014 even though all of the island was designated as a federal disaster area.As the island continues to reel, the hope is that $1.27 billion for two years of extra food stamp funding will eventually arrive under a relief package signed last month by President Trump. It would have been far better for island residents if this aid had been on tap as soon as the disaster hit, as it was in Florida and Texas. In Florida, $1.2 billion was spent on emergency food stamp help after Hurricane Irma.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Tax Plan Diverges From House Version, Highlighting Political Pressures", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe disparate bills show the competing pressures that Republican lawmakers are facing and the calculations that Senate and House leaders are making to ensure passage of the bills through their respective chambers. While both bills share the main priorities of cutting corporate and individual taxes, they diverge on matters of high political sensitivity, particularly for vulnerable House Republicans from high-tax states and for Senate Republicans concerned about adding to the federal budget deficit.Senate staff members said their draft would require changes, likely major ones, to survive procedural rules that allow it to pass on a party-line vote. Those changes could include setting some of the tax cuts to expire after a period of years.Senators Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said the bill did not go far enough in increasing the child tax credit, which rose to $1,650 per child in the Senate version, from $1,600 in the House bill, and would now be available to families making up to $1 million a year, a leap from a current income limit of $110,000. \u201cThe Senate is not going to pass a bill that isn\u2019t clearly pro-family,\u201d they said in a joint statement, \u201cso we look forward to working with our colleagues to get there.\u201d\u201cThe Street definitely felt like there was some connection between tax policy and the market reaction, which was pretty severe,\u201d said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management in New York.FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group, called the Senate\u2019s plan to delay the corporate tax cut \u201cunacceptable.\u201dStill, several business groups and Republican leaders applauded the movement in both chambers. The influential National Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses and had opposed the House bill, reversed course and said it backed both an amended House bill and the Senate version. Other groups shook off the delayed rate cut and embraced the Senate plan.\u201cIt\u2019s been a week of remarkable progress,\u201d said Michael A. Steel, a former House leadership aide who is a managing director for Hamilton Place Strategies, a consultancy in Washington.Republican leaders expressed optimism that they could quickly address concerns and resolve the competing political pressures facing their lawmakers in the Senate and House.\u201cThis will be met with Senate consternation and all kinds of things,\u201d said Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois, who oversees the Ways and Means tax policy subcommittee. \u201cBut when it comes down to it, what we\u2019re on the verge today is winning an argument \u2014 winning an argument about the future of our economy and what our worldview is.\u201dThe bill set for introduction in the Senate Finance Committee includes seven income brackets, scuttling some of the simplicity that House drafters used to sell their bill, which reduced the number of brackets to four.It would keep the bottom tax bracket for individuals at 10 percent, which the House had raised to 12 percent, and would reduce the top rate for high earners to 38.5 percent, down from the current rate of 39.6 percent, which the House had maintained. Like the House bill, the Senate\u2019s version plans to roughly double the standard deduction and expand the child tax credit.The starkest example of the competing priorities is the state and local tax deduction, which is heavily used in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California, which are represented by Democrats in the Senate but have some Republican representatives in the House. The Senate completely eliminates the valuable tax break, which allows taxpayers to deduct state and local income, sales and property taxes. The House bill would still allow individuals to deduct property taxes up to $10,000.Some House Republicans have already rejected that limitation as too strict and the Senate\u2019s complete elimination could further spook those members, whose political future could be imperiled if they pass a plan that actually increases their constituents\u2019 tax bills.\u201cEvery state should be a winner in tax reform, and in my opinion, that would not be the case if the Senate view were to prevail,\u201d said Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey. \u201cI\u2019m not voting for the $10,000, so I\u2019m certainly not voting for zero,\u201d Mr. Lance said.The bill would add $1.5 trillion to federal budget deficits over a decade, without accounting for additional economic growth it might spur, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But Senate staff members suggested that the Finance Committee would need to make changes to ensure it does not lose revenue after 10 years, and thus stays in compliance with the procedural rules that would allow the bill to pass on a party-line vote.In another significant departure from the House bill, the Senate would not create a special, lower top rate for so-called pass-through entities, which are businesses whose profits are distributed to their owners and taxed as individual income. Instead, the Senate would create a 17.4 percent deduction on income taxes for pass-through owners of all income levels, effectively cutting rates both on rich owners and on middle-class small-business owners who would not have benefited from the House\u2019s original lower pass-through rate. For service-providing pass-throughs, it would phase out that benefit for individuals with income above $75,000 and for married couples with income above $150,000.On Thursday, in the face of pushback from fellow Republican lawmakers, small businesses and other industry groups, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, who leads the Ways and Means Committee, unveiled a 29-page amendment making further revisions to the House\u2019s tax plan. The amendment restores the adoption tax credit, which the House tax plan had planned to repeal. It also creates a new, lower tax rate for certain business owners.Under the new provision, the first $37,500 of business income would be taxed at 9 percent, rather than 12 percent, for an unmarried individual earning less than $75,000 through a pass-through business. For a married couple, the dollar amounts would be double.The Senate is also including a provision to prevent large multinational corporations from stashing profits overseas. The bill will propose a new business tax on American and foreign companies \u2014 effectively a minimum tax on their income earned in the United States \u2014 while also levying a 12.5 percent tax on income that American companies receive overseas from their intellectual property.Preliminary estimates indicate the provision would raise more than $130 billion in tax revenue over 10 years to help offset revenue lost from rate cuts, committee staff members said. The original House approach, which would have levied a 20 percent \u201cexcise tax\u201d on payments between American and foreign companies that are affiliated with each other, would have raised an estimated $155 billion in revenue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "The Paradise PapersThe tech giant has found a tax haven in the island of Jersey, leaving billions of dollars untouched by the United States, leaked documents reveal.Supported byTim Cook was angry.\u201cWe pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar,\u201d Mr. Cook declared at the hearing. \u201cWe don\u2019t depend on tax gimmicks,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe don\u2019t stash money on some Caribbean island.\u201dTrue enough. The island Apple would soon rely on was in the English Channel.Five months after Mr. Cook\u2019s testimony, Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the small island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income.Apple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.The previously undisclosed story of Apple\u2019s search for a new tax haven and its use of Jersey is among the findings emerging from a cache of secret corporate records from Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm that caters to businesses and the wealthy elite.The documents reveal how big law firms help clients weave their way through the gaps between different countries\u2019 tax rules. Appleby clients have transferred trademarks, patent rights and other valuable assets into offshore shell companies, avoiding billions of dollars in taxes. The rights to Nike\u2019s Swoosh trademark, Uber\u2019s taxi-hailing app, Allergan\u2019s Botox patents and Facebook\u2019s social media technology have all resided in shell companies that listed as their headquarters Appleby offices in Bermuda and Grand Cayman, the records show.\u201cU.S. multinational firms are the global grandmasters of tax avoidance schemes that deplete not just U.S. tax collection but the tax collection of most every large economy in the world,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a former corporate tax adviser to such companies who is now a law professor at the University of Southern California.Indeed, tax strategies like the ones used by Apple \u2014 as well as Amazon, Google, Starbucks and others \u2014 cost governments around the world as much as $240 billion a year in lost revenue, according to a 2015 estimate by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The disclosures come on the heels of last week\u2019s proposals by Republican lawmakers to provide several new tax benefits for multinational companies, including cutting the federal corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. President Trump has said that American businesses are getting a bad deal under current rules.But the documents show how major American companies find creative ways to avoid paying anything close to 35 percent.Apple, for example, pays taxes at a small fraction of that rate on its offshore profits, according to calculations by The Times based on the company\u2019s securities filings. Apple reports that nearly 70 percent of its worldwide profits are earned offshore.An Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, declined to answer most questions about the company\u2019s tax strategy. He did say that Apple had told regulators \u2014 in the United States and Ireland and at the European Commission \u2014 about the reorganization of its Irish subsidiaries. \u201cThe changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cAt Apple we follow the laws, and if the system changes we will comply. We strongly support efforts from the global community toward comprehensive international tax reform and a far simpler system.\u201dIn prepared statements, Allergan, Facebook, Nike and Uber said they complied with tax regulations around the world.Congressional Republicans are also seeking to impose a 10 percent tax on some of the profits that American businesses say are earned offshore \u2014 half the rate they are proposing for profits in the United States. The lawmakers have also proposed another break, permitting multinationals to bring home more than $2.6 trillion stowed offshore at sharply reduced tax rates. Both proposals, critics say, would only create additional incentives for businesses like Apple to shift more profits into island hideaways.Appleby is a member of the global network of lawyers, accountants and bankers who set up or manage offshore companies and accounts for clients who want to avoid taxes or keep their finances a secret from authorities, business partners or even spouses. The firm did not respond to questions from The Times about its work for Apple or other companies.Tax authorities have challenged several of the offshore structures maintained by Appleby and Estera, a spinoff of the law firm\u2019s corporate services business. Nike won a fight over back taxes with the Internal Revenue Service a year ago; a similar dispute between the I.R.S. and Facebook is continuing.European regulators are trying to force countries including Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to collect back taxes from big companies that relied on offshore arrangements. Apple is being pursued for $14.5 billion in back taxes after European regulators ruled that its old tax structure amounted to illegal state aid from the Irish government.Since the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens. Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions \u2014 mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2014 now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the world\u2019s population.Criticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.In May 2013, the Senate\u2019s investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apple\u2019s tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared \u201ctax residency\u201d nowhere in the world.Under Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is \u201cmanaged and controlled\u201d abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax. By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.At the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there. The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.\u201cApple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,\u201d then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.Ireland\u2019s finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, at first defended his country\u2019s policies: \u201cI do not want to be the whipping boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.\u201d Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies. Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.But by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.At that time, Apple had accumulated $111 billion in offshore cash, mostly in its Irish subsidiaries. Billions of dollars in new profits poured into them each year. Yet they paid almost no corporate income tax.Company officials wanted to keep it that way. So Apple sought alternatives to the tax arrangement Ireland would soon shut down. And the officials wanted to be quiet about it.\u201cFor those of you who are not aware Apple are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,\u201d wrote Cameron Adderley, global head of Appleby\u2019s corporate department, in a March 20, 2014 email to other senior partners. \u201cThey also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.\u201dIn building Apple\u2019s new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor. A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago. The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax regulators. It has also fought international proposals for tax avoidance crackdowns.Baker McKenzie wanted to use a local Appleby office to maintain an offshore arrangement for Apple. For Appleby, Mr. Adderley said, this assignment was \u201ca tremendous opportunity for us to shine on a global basis with Baker McKenzie.\u201dBaker McKenzie\u2019s San Francisco office emailed a 14-item questionnaire in March 2014 to Appleby\u2019s offices in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey.\u201cConfirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities (such as board meetings, signing of important contracts) without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction,\u201d the document requested. Baker McKenzie also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: \u201cAre there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?\u201d(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, \u201cAs a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.\u201d)Apple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Appleby\u2019s office in Jersey, which is one of the Channel Islands and has strong links to the British banking system. Jersey makes its own laws and is not subject to most European Union legislation, making it a popular tax haven.But the plan to use Jersey faced a potential snag: In mid-2014, again under pressure from other governments, Irish ministers explored ending a tax shelter known as the \u201cdouble Irish,\u201d used by scores of companies, including the Appleby clients Allergan and Facebook, as well as Google, LinkedIn and other businesses.The double Irish allows companies to collect profits through one subsidiary that employs people in Ireland, then route those profits to an Irish mailbox subsidiary that is a tax resident of an offshore haven like Bermuda, Grand Cayman or the Isle of Man.Irish officials explored a ban on Irish companies claiming tax residency in tax havens. Executives at Allergan \u2014 which had used a double Irish for at least a decade, records show \u2014 tried to derail the rule change. Terilea Wielenga, then Allergan\u2019s head of tax, was also international president of the Tax Executives Institute, a trade group. She argued to the Irish finance ministry in July 2014 that any such changes should occur slowly.The campaign seemed to work. \u201cFor existing companies, there will be provision for a transition period until the end of 2020,\u201d Mr. Noonan declared in October 2014. The gradual phase-in would apply not just to existing companies but to any new ones created by December of that year.This gave Apple just enough time. By the end of the year, Jersey had become the new tax home of the Irish companies Apple Sales International and Apple Operations International.But a third Apple subsidiary, Apple Operations Europe, became resident in Ireland.Apple would not say why. But tax experts offer one possible reason. While media attention focused on Ireland\u2019s crackdown on the double Irish, officials announced a new measure: The country expanded its tax deductions for companies that move rights to intellectual property \u2014 like patents and trademarks \u2014 into Ireland. If an Irish company spent $15 billion buying such rights, even from a fellow subsidiary, it could claim a $1 billion tax deduction each year for 15 years.Apple declined to say whether it has availed itself of the new benefit.But J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova law professor and former I.R.S. official who reviewed the Appleby documents, concluded that there was a strong possibility the company moved intellectual property into Ireland to take advantage of the generous tax rules. Based on Apple\u2019s American securities filings, he estimated that the transfer was worth about $200 billion.That would mean that any income that Apple now generates in Ireland could be partially offset by more than $13 billion in tax deductions each year for 15 years.Apple\u2019s hunt for a tax haven is a familiar tale, said Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, who also reviewed the Appleby documents.\u201cThis is how it usually works: You close one tax shelter, and something else opens up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just goes on endlessly.\u201dSimon Bowers is a reporter for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Advertisement"}

The economy has been expanding since the start of 2016, the longest streak of growth since one that began in 1999.Not all the data was positive: The pace of expansion slowed from the previous quarter and consumer spending declined. But the results were roughly in line with economists\u2019 predictions. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast a growth rate of 1.3 percent, on average.The economic expansion came mostly from abroad.The government\u2019s stimulus program, colloquially known as Abenomics after the prime minister, calls for the central bank to inject vast amounts of money into the financial system. That weakens the yen, making Japanese cars, electronics and other products more attractive to foreign buyers.The domestic side of the economy was weaker. While exports increased 6 percent in annualized terms, household consumption fell 1.9 percent, the data showed. Business investment was more robust, expanding 1 percent \u2014 a sign that companies expect Japan\u2019s growth streak to last awhile longer.Consumer prices have been declining in Japan since the 1990s, a debilitating cycle known as deflation that can lead consumers and companies to put off purchases or investments, hitting economic growth and leading to a vicious cycle where prices continue to fall. That has squeezed companies\u2019 revenues, leaving them with less money to pay workers.Ending deflation is the ultimate goal of Abenomics. After lurching between rises and falls for about five years, consumer prices have been rising steadily, if modestly, this year. Though inflation \u2014 now at 0.7 percent by the Bank of Japan\u2019s preferred \u201ccore\u201d measure \u2014 remains at less than half the target of 2 percent, some analysts say they think the government may soon declare an official end to the two-decade deflationary scourge.In Monday\u2019s data, the G.D.P. deflator \u2014 one of several measures of price trends \u2014 turned positive in the third quarter, another sign that deflationary pressure in the economy has eased.Advertisement"}

But Sunday\u2019s attack took more lives in an American place of worship than any previous shooting, and resulted in the largest body count of children since the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012, in which 20 children died. Police now say that half the victims in Sutherland were children, the youngest a girl of 18 months.Our national reaction to mass shootings in general, and to those involving children in particular, is saturated with theological rhetoric. Politicians call for prayers and bemoan senseless evil; critics denounce their appeals as cynical and skewer them for hypocritical complicity. The children themselves are described as angels, wrenched from the world too soon, leaving behind a heavy burden for those who loved them to bear. The suffering of children has long been seen as a litmus for how individuals and cultures stake their values \u2014 consider the poems of William Blake, or Dostoyevsky\u2019s Grand Inquisitor in \u201cThe Brothers Karamazov\u201d \u2014 and these brutal deaths are no exception. The dead children in Sutherland, like the dead in Sandy Hook, are framed as paradigmatically innocent; the society in which they died, as fallen, as corrupted.Sacrifice is, strictly speaking, a transactional concept. Something is given up in exchange for something else. The implicit paradigm here is of a loss that leads to redemption, a forfeiture that purifies. But there is nothing redeeming, or that could ever redeem, a dozen dead children.Not surprisingly, mass shootings are overwhelmingly committed by men, and by men who, more than any other defining characteristic, have histories of domestic abuse and of harming those closest to them. Rather than just \u201csnapping,\u201d these are wrathful men who nurse grudges and who are plagued by a sense of insufficiency and of having been slighted and exploited. In other words, they are men who see their own lives as wasted, and who then set out to lay waste to the lives of others around them in a self-destructive conflagration. This is the opposite of sacrifice, of any logic of exchange: It is a desire to simply annihilate self, other, and one\u2019s entire world in a single grand gesture of destruction. It is waste, all the way down, to the bitter end.What do we gain by seeing this slow-motion national nightmare as so much waste? Among other things, we can see it as an organic continuation of some of the most basic and foundational American dreams. As the historian Nancy Isenberg documents, the architects of the early American colonial enterprise saw the \u201cnew\u201d continent as a \u201cwasteland\u201d \u2014 an under-exploited landscape to be populated by the labor of \u201cwaste people,\u201d the social detritus of the early modern British economy.These marginalized individuals were understood quite literally as disposable human fertilizer for pastoralizing the American wilderness, only one facet of a settler-colonial regime\u2019s ruthless exploitation and extinguishing of human lives, which extended from indentured labor to chattel slavery to ethnic cleansing and beyond. So, too, the realization of our Manifest Destiny was so much laying waste, and our rise to the status of world\u2019s most powerful military nation, an achievement built, with no exaggeration, on the deaths of millions.To speak of this history as having a \u201clegacy\u201d is to relegate to the past tense a reality that still operates within the present moment. It is also to foster the na\u00efve dream that, since it is something separate from us, in the past, it is now something we can cleanly redeem in the present. But our American logic of waste unfolds in the grinding operations of a brutish society in which no wasted lives, no matter how nominally innocent nor how violently destroyed, seem able to galvanize change in our murderous status quo.No transaction could ever redeem this, and to the extent that we remain wedded to the logic of sacrifice, we remain trapped in an endless cycle of waiting for a transaction that could. Only by truly seeing what we truly are can we hope to become something different.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "10 of Our Best Reads on Zimbabwe", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Mugabe is the only leader Zimbabwe has known since it achieved independence in 1980. Formerly known as Southern Rhodesia, the country was ruled by Britain and later by a white-minority government that was shunned by the international community.But under Mr. Mugabe\u2019s party, ZANU-PF, a once-wealthy nation saw its economy steadily deteriorate, and the governing party became consumed by infighting.Here is a selection of in-depth articles about the country since 2010:Mr. Mugabe had finally come down against the military and its political allies in a long-running feud within the governing party.Her political maneuvering with allies in the G-40 faction \u2014 so called because many of its members were in their 40s \u2014 angered veterans of Zimbabwe\u2019s war of liberation, many of whom remained loyal to Mr. Mnangagwa.Despite the spread of cheap smartphones in recent years, Zimbabwe remains low-tech. Blackouts are part of everyday life.But the country is hurtling toward a plastic future for a simple reason: It is running out of cash, specifically the American dollars it adopted in 2009 before abandoning its own troubled currency.Zimbabwe made international headlines when it started seizing white-owned farms in 2000. The latest people to have their farms seized are not white farmers, but dozens of political figures who have fallen out of favor by defecting from ZANU-PF.With the economy in peril, and the party split in a scramble for power, land is being used as a vital tool in the struggle for control.A veteran of Zimbabwe\u2019s war of independence, and the widow of an even more famous freedom fighter, Joice Mujuru once considered like a daughter to Mr. Mugabe. She rose to become vice president and was destined, it seemed, to succeed him.As Mr. Mugabe has grown visibly weaker, talk of his death has dominated the private conversations of the governing class, leading to some cutthroat maneuvering for the endgame.To many Zimbabweans, the president\u2019s decline has been obvious. The same man who unyieldingly defied the West, who outwitted or ruthlessly crushed his opponents for decades while leaders in other countries were felled in coups, has been caught on video stumbling or dozing off during public events.Morgan Tsvangirai\u2019s Movement for Democratic Change has been the major opposition party challenging Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ZANU-PF. But ahead of the 2013 elections, there was widespread disenchantment with Mr. Tsvangirai\u2019s movement.Four years of governing alongside Mr. Mugabe \u2014 and in some ways, analysts say, being co-opted by him and his allies \u2014 took a toll on its reputation.Before Zimbabwe\u2019s government began the violent and chaotic seizure of white-owned farms in 2000, fewer than 2,000 farmers were growing tobacco, the country\u2019s most lucrative crop, and most were white.Today, 60,000 farmers grow tobacco here, the vast majority of them black and many of them working small plots that were allotted to them in the land upheavals. Most had no tobacco farming experience yet managed to produce a hefty crop.The success of these small-scale farmers has led some experts to reassess the legacy of Zimbabwe\u2019s forced land redistribution, even as they condemn its violence and destruction.Government efforts to bury history instead provoked slumbering memories of the Gukurahundi, Zimbabwe\u2019s name for the slaying and torture of thousands of civilians in the Matabeleland region a quarter-century ago.Soldiers trained and equipped by North Korea killed at least 10,000 civilians in the Ndebele minority between 1983 and 1987.In 2010, Zimbabwe was poorer than any of the 183 countries the United Nations had income data for.It was also one of only three countries in the world to be worse off now on combined measures of health, education and income than it was 40 years ago, the United Nations found.For many rural Zimbabweans, cash remained so scarce that the 85-bed Chidamoyo Christian Hospital allowed its patients to barter. Studies found that fees were a major barrier to medical care in rural areas, where most Zimbabweans live.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Worldwide Size Up Palace Intrigue in Oil-Rich Kingdom", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust two weeks ago, Saudi Arabia gathered the global business elite in Riyadh, promising a new age for the oil-rich kingdom as it sought to court overseas money and investment.International investors and business executives are now trying to interpret the power play.To some, the arrests portend a quick consolidation of authority under the young, reformist Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who wants to vault the country to modernity. In that way, the arrests are viewed as a sign that the crown prince will be able to push through his ambitious economic agenda, including selling off shares in the giant state oil company.To others, the arrests point to the potential for political tumult that could lead to the collapse of his entire project. Overseas investors have been reluctant to plow money into a country where the rule of law is weak and the ruling family trumps all.\u201cIt might have good consequences for stability maybe, or just the opposite,\u201d said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, an oil service company that does business across the Middle East and North Africa. \u201cIt\u2019s questionable what is happening behind the scenes, it is a very secretive society.\u201dThe arrests came at an awkward time for the kingdom.Despite the goodwill, few had backed the effort with time and money. And the weekend\u2019s arrests could add to that reluctance. But they could also change some perceptions, if the crown prince can eventually show a broader commitment to shaking up an entrenched royal bureaucracy.\u201cI think this is going to slow things down, but if the gambit is successful it will help,\u201d said Charif Souki, chairman of Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas company now attempting to make energy deals with Saudi Arabia. Speaking of Crown Crown Prince Mohammed, he said, \u201cOnce he has consolidated power, he will do what he wants to do, which is to modernize the country and modernize Islam, which are all good things. But it might be very dangerous and it might not work.\u201dEven before the arrests, investors didn\u2019t quite know what to make of the kingdom.The crown prince and his father, King Salman, have also won praise from local and international business leaders for their promises to return the kingdom to the kind of religious moderation that was more prevalent before a period of religious and sectarian unrest in 1979, when the royal family began to rely on conservative Islamic clerics to guarantee stability. They have had the temerity to take on the religious police and begin rolling back some social policies.But Saudi Arabia has also faced unusual turbulence, complete with the sacking of two crown princes, a costly war in Yemen and a confrontation with Qatar. The weak price of oil has amplified the financial stress in the kingdom. The government has been forced to cut benefits for highly paid civil servants.There remains a great deal of skepticism that the economic re-engineering can be pulled off, in part because much of the royal family and old guard have been made rich from payments by Saudi Aramco, whose books are essentially closed to the public. That is one reason there is growing talk that the Saudis will eventually turn to China, rather than the London or New York stock exchanges, to get around Western regulators and raise capital for Saudi Aramco.\u201cI don\u2019t see them get investor interest unless they can produce a set of financial books that have been audited to Western accounting standards,\u201d said Nancy T. Schmitt, president of Taum Sauk Investments, a firm based in New York that specializes in energy. \u201cIf this is a step to getting to that, then this is a good thing. But I don\u2019t know that because I can\u2019t read the palace intrigue.\u201dThe arrests just make it harder to sort through the business climate.Some interpreted the arrests as being disturbingly arbitrary. One of the officials arrested was the former Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a Saudi Aramco board member. Another was Adel Fakieh, an early drafter of the crown prince\u2019s reforms, who was ousted from his post of economy minister earlier Saturday.\u201cI don\u2019t think it sends a particularly good signal to investors,\u201d said Rachel Ziemba, managing director for emerging markets at Roubini Global Economics, a research firm in New York.There is another school of thought among business leaders and analysts that the arrests were part of an effort to make the Saudi Aramco offering and other reforms unstoppable. In that way, it would be the sort of proof that the crown prince has the power to get his agenda done.\u201cThis is just the kind of determination and commitment that is called for,\u201d said Sadad al-Husseini, former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco.Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, who attended the Riyadh conference, was somewhat more circumspect. \u201cDoes this scare off a pension fund or can this be sold as creating the necessary conditions of success?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-stakes game.\u201dKate Kelly contributed reporting from New York and Stanley Reed from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is America Wasting So Much Energy?", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsPartisan fights in Washington can leave the impression that we\u2019re hopelessly divided. The truth is there are plenty of bipartisan solutions to the energy and environmental challenges we face, and energy efficiency is near the top of the list.We shouldn\u2019t accept that.Energy efficiency is one of the most powerful resources we have for meeting our energy and environmental goals. It is also an enormous economic opportunity.We\u2019re making progress. Federal programs like Energy Star (which identifies and clearly labels the most efficient products on the market) are saving American consumers and businesses billions of dollars per year while reducing power plant pollution. Also, America\u2019s utilities are doing their part, investing $7.5 billion annually in cost-effective electricity and natural gas efficiency programs.Yet many of the federal efficiency programs stimulating this progress are under threat in Washington. The Trump administration has proposed killing Energy Star and all but eliminating other efficiency programs, with cuts averaging nearly 80 percent. Congress wisely rejected these proposals initially for the short term, but legislation recently passed by the House isn\u2019t much better, proposing to cut many of these money-saving and job-creating programs nearly in half.Eliminating or weakening Energy Star and other efficiency programs is absolutely going in the wrong direction.Energy efficiency is not new \u2014 it was our grandparents\u2019 energy policy: Don\u2019t waste. Save as much as you can for later when you, or future generations, might need it.We need energy efficiency to accommodate emerging technologies and population growth, which are putting demands on our electricity grids that our grandparents never imagined. We can do so much more than shutting off our lights or keeping a close eye on the thermostat.That\u2019s where smart policy and programs come into play.Our federal agencies run some of the most innovative efficiency programs in the world. They work with American manufacturers on the latest efficiency technologies to improve productivity and competitiveness. They develop efficiency standards for household appliances, saving families an average of $500 per year. They provide testing and expertise to local and state governments trying to adopt the most effective building-efficiency codes for homes and commercial buildings.This is not federal bureaucracy run amok. It\u2019s good government that will save taxpayers money and drive our economy. To critics who say that \u201cgovernment intervention isn\u2019t needed to save energy\u201d or \u201cefficiency standards are intrusive federal mandates,\u201d the best response is simply to invoke a decades-long record of economic and environmental success across the nation, dating back at least 30 years, when the first legislation authorizing federal efficiency standards was signed by President Ronald Reagan.Among those who supported Donald Trump, the number was 90 percent.It\u2019s hard to beat those numbers. Congress should come together and deliver strong funding for federal efficiency programs. Energy efficiency presents both Republicans and Democrats with an opportunity to reach consensus on an issue that is good for their constituents and the environment. Taxpayers and customers win. It\u2019s a nonpartisan solution to a nonpartisan challenge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Tax Bill Would Look Like for 25,000 Middle-Class Families", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nEach dot represents one household in the middle class in 2018The tax bill being debated in the Senate this week would affect nearly every American. Numerous analyses have estimated the average impact of the bill on household finances, and advocates on both sides have produced examples of \u201ctypical\u201d families that would win or lose under the plan.Such analyses, however, tend to gloss over the remarkable diversity of Americans\u2019 financial situations. In truth, there is no \u201ctypical\u201d American household. Even families that look similar on the surface can differ in ways that radically alter their situation come tax season.A couple of things should jump out right away. First, there are more dots on the right side of the chart than the left \u2014 more households would get a tax cut than a tax increase. (The chart represents the impact in 2018; the situation looks considerably different in 2027, after many provisions of the bill are set to expire.)Second, the dots are all over the place. Look at the line of households earning about $100,000 a year. On the far left of the chart, there\u2019s a household that would pay more than $4,000 more in taxes under the Senate plan. On the far right is a household that earns almost the same amount but that would pay $4,000 less under the plan. (All figures are relative to what each household would pay under existing tax law.)If you want to understand the tax bill, it helps to understand what factors separate those two families, and all the other families in between.Households that take the standard deductionHouseholds that itemizeThe United States tax code is full of specialized deductions \u2014 for charitable donations, mortgage interest, medical expenses and lots more. But about three-quarters of middle-class taxpayers don\u2019t have to worry about any of that \u2014 they take the so-called standard deduction, which replaces most of those specialized tax breaks with a single lump sum.The Senate bill would roughly double the standard deduction: to $12,000 for an individual or $24,000 for married couples. As a result, most middle-class households that take the standard deduction now would get a tax cut under the bill in 2018, and almost none would get a tax increase.The story is very different for the roughly one-quarter of middle-class families that itemize deductions. The Senate bill would eliminate some popular tax breaks, including deductions for state and local taxes. As a result, households that take those deductions now could lose out. In total, about 40 percent of households that itemize their deductions would pay more in 2018 under the Senate bill \u2014 in some cases a lot more.Married with no childrenMarried with one childMarried with two childrenThe Senate bill would affect different types of families differently. It\u2019s easier to see how the various provisions would play out when we sort the data based on the number of children in each household.Start with the chart on the left, which shows just married couples with no children. There\u2019s still plenty of variation, but now some clear patterns emerge. For the roughly 70 percent of these couples that take the standard deduction, the G.O.P. bill has three main changes that matter: the doubling of the standard deduction (which helps them), the elimination of the personal exemption (which hurts them) and the revision of the income tax brackets (which would lower tax rates at many income levels).The heavy diagonal line on the chart reflects the most common situation for these couples. Those earning $40,000 \u2014 roughly the bottom of the middle class in our definition \u2014 get about a $300 tax cut. Higher earners get a bigger cut, in absolute terms, because they have more income that\u2019s subject to the reduced tax rate. (The fainter vertical line represents mostly older people. Much Social Security income isn\u2019t taxed, so they benefit from the higher standard deduction, but many aren\u2019t affected by the lower tax rate.)Pay little in state and local taxesPay a moderate amount of state and local taxesPay a lot in state and local taxesOne of the bill\u2019s most significant changes would be the elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes. More than 40 million households wrote off a combined $350 billion in state and local income and sales taxes in 2015, according to the I.R.S., and 38 million households deducted close to $200 billion in property taxes. Both deductions would disappear under the Senate bill. (The House version of the bill would get rid of the deduction for income and sales taxes but would cap \u2014 not eliminate \u2014 the property-tax deduction.)The charts above group households into three broad categories. The group on the left deducts little in state and local taxes; many deduct nothing at all and instead take the standard deduction. The group on the right deducts $4,400 or more in state and local taxes (including income, sales and property taxes), and as a result, many would pay more under the Senate bill.Many households most affected by the loss of the state and local tax deduction live in coastal states such as New York, California and Connecticut. Those states have high tax rates; they also tend to vote for Democrats. In Connecticut, for example, more than 40 percent of taxpayers deducted either income or sales taxes in 2015, compared with just 28 percent in the United States as a whole.As the charts show, households that take large state and local deductions also tend to be relatively wealthy. That\u2019s partly because richer households tend to take bigger deductions across the board. But it\u2019s also a reflection of the higher cost of living \u2014 and correspondingly higher incomes \u2014 in many coastal states.Excluding impact of corporate tax cutsIncluding impact of corporate tax cutsUntil now, we\u2019ve been focusing on the impact of the Senate bill on people\u2019s taxes in 2018, when most households would get at least a small tax cut. But the situation would look very different a decade from now. That\u2019s because in order to reduce the cost of the bill, its authors set essentially all of the individual tax cuts \u2014 the doubled standard deduction, the more generous child credit, the lower tax rates \u2014 to expire after 2025. But one provision that\u2019s bad for taxpayers \u2014 changing the measure of inflation used for many tax calculations \u2014 would not expire. As a result, two-thirds of middle-class households would get a tax increase in 2027, and none \u2014 zero percent \u2014 would get a tax cut. (That\u2019s what\u2019s shown in the left-hand chart above.)Those figures, however, consider only how the bill would affect personal income taxes. Starting in 2019, the bill would also cut taxes on businesses. Unlike the personal tax provisions, the business tax cuts would not expire.Congress\u2019s in-house tax analyst, the Joint Committee on Taxation, estimates that about 25 percent of the cuts to corporate taxes would go to workers in the form of higher incomes. Using that and some other assumptions from the committee, we can allocate the corporate tax cuts to individual households, which is what we show in the chart on the right above. A bit under half of middle-class households would get a tax cut \u2014 or, technically, an increase in after-tax income \u2014 under these assumptions, and a bit more than half would see their after-tax income go down compared with under existing law. Both the cuts and the increases would generally be small for middle-class households, although the gains could be significant for some wealthy households.Compared with the 2018 analysis, conclusions about the effects of the tax bill in 2027 are highly uncertain. On the one hand, Republicans argue that Congress is unlikely to allow tax cuts to expire in 2026 as planned, so the middle class might do better than this analysis suggests. On the other, many liberal economists argue that the Joint Committee on Taxation is too generous in its assumptions about how much workers would benefit from the corporate tax cuts. Our analysis makes no effort to account for the broader economic effects of either the tax cuts or of the extra debt that the government would have to take on to pay for them. It also doesn\u2019t account for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, a provision that would have a much bigger impact in 2027 than in 2018.The tax analysis is confined exclusively to middle-class households, defined as households that earn two-thirds to two times household-size adjusted median income. That\u2019s roughly $40,000 to $125,000 for a family of four, or about $30,000 to $90,000 for a couple. For singles, the middle class starts at about $20,000, although to make the charts more readable, we aren\u2019t showing households earning less than $40,000. (We\u2019re using what tax analysts call \u201cexpanded income,\u201d which includes cash income but also noncash items such as employer contributions to health insurance and the employer share of payroll taxes.)Advertisement"}

The drop in price, to the equivalent of about 6 cents a kilogram, would require further sacrifices.Since the 1990s, the world has shipped its waste paper, discarded plastic and unwanted metals to China, where they are destined to be used as raw materials to help power the country\u2019s export-driven manufacturing boom. In 2016, China imported about $18 billion worth of what the government calls solid waste.But China doesn\u2019t want to be the rest of the world\u2019s trash can. Over the summer, regulators in Beijing started an unusually intense crackdown on what they called \u201cforeign garbage,\u201d citing health and environmental concerns.As China revved up its manufacturing machine to power growth over the years, officials were willing to tolerate some of the downside of scrap, namely the pollution of local soil and rivers by low-end recycling practices. But China\u2019s economic might increasingly means that it no longer needs to make such environmental sacrifices.\u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s common challenge,\u201d he said.China\u2019s regulatory fight against imported garbage began in 2013, when a flurry of port inspections forced overseas recyclers to clean up their operations and invest in new waste-sorting technologies.\u201cI was angry, but I knew I was just a small businesswoman,\u201d Ms. Leung, 63, said of the wastepaper restrictions as she picked through cardboard, polystyrene and soda cans in a rat-infested alley in the Mong Kok district of Hong Kong on a recent morning.Ms. Leung and thousands of other small-time scrap collectors sell the waste to traders at bare-bones collection points in this semiautonomous Chinese territory. The waste is then processed at recycling depots and exported to mainland China or elsewhere.\u201cWithout China, there will be less recycling in the United States, and it will cost more,\u201d Mr. Minter said.Workers at Hong Kong\u2019s junkyards and scrap depots said that Beijing\u2019s new and pending restrictions on waste imports were already affecting their bottom lines.At a recycling depot on the city\u2019s outskirts that looks out onto the Chinese mainland, the manager, Ryan Cheung, said local scrap collectors were selling him more plastics than usual, apparently because the new rules were already limiting their options. As a result, chest-high pallets of off-white packaging film were piling up under the depot\u2019s corrugated-metal roof.\u201cI can\u2019t buy anymore,\u201d he said, standing near a pitching-mound-size heap of dismembered Barbie dolls as garbage trucks lumbered down a nearby road toward a landfill. \u201cI have too much.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

So in May 2010, the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund stepped in with what was characterized as a 110 billion euro ($146 billion at the time) bailout.\u201cFiscal waterboarding\u201d is the name that the University of Athens economist Yanis Varoufakis gave to this process, after the torture method that simulates near-drowning again and again. And just as intelligence experts generally don\u2019t think waterboarding is an effective way to extract information, it is hard to find an outside economic or financial expert who thinks the troika\u2019s Greece policy has been effective or sensible.So why has it continued? This is the most important question Varoufakis sets out to answer in this account of the six months he spent as Greece\u2019s finance minister in 2015. \u201cAdults in the Room\u201d is several things: a gripping tale of an outspoken intellectual\u2019s sudden immersion in high-stakes politics, an at times overwrought riposte to the many people in and outside Greece who derided his efforts and a solid work of explanatory economics. Most of all, though, it is an attempt to divine why smart, seemingly decent politicians and bureaucrats would continue pushing a pointlessly cruel approach long after its pointlessness had become clear. The book\u2019s subtitle (\u201cMy Battle With the European and American Deep Establishment\u201d) might lead a reader to expect all manner of sinister machinations. But while there are a few internal Greek political plots that can be fairly described as conspiracies, at the international level it\u2019s mainly what Varoufakis calls \u201can authentic drama \u2026 reminiscent of a play by Aeschylus or Shakespeare in which powerful schemers end up caught in a trap of their own making.\u201dAt the outset of the narrative, the former United States Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers asks Varoufakis in a dimly lit hotel bar in Washington, D.C., whether he is an \u201cinsider\u201d or \u201coutsider,\u201d warning that outsiders (those who \u201cprioritize their freedom to speak their version of the truth\u201d) tend to have a hard time getting anything accomplished in government.Varoufakis was and is obviously an outsider. He had made his name with colorful critiques of Greek and European economic policies. Even as he allied himself with Alexis Tsipras and his leftist Syriza Party to run for office in January 2015, he didn\u2019t actually join the party. And once in office he continued to behave in ways that finance ministers aren\u2019t supposed to, tooling around Athens on his Yamaha XJR motorcycle and famously showing up for a meeting on Downing Street in a too-tight, too-bright blue shirt and a leather overcoat described by one British fashion writer as a \u201cdrug dealer\u2019s coat.\u201dThat bold fashion statement, Varoufakis recounts, was unintentional \u2014 the result of leaving his suitcase in a cab in Athens two days before. Arriving in Paris on a Saturday evening after most stores had closed, he had to make do with a couple of shirts from Zara and a coat borrowed from the Greek ambassador to France.Varoufakis had hoped to engineer an orderly bankruptcy for Greece within the euro, with the country\u2019s debts significantly reduced and austerity scaled back. Failing that, though, he was willing to pull Greece out of the euro and go the sovereign-debt-crisis route.The German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the dominant figure in European financial affairs, openly favored the latter course. His harsh but not entirely unreasonable view was that it had been a mistake to let Greece into the eurozone, and that the only way forward was for Greece to leave. Chancellor Angela Merkel, on the other hand, was unwilling to contemplate a \u201cGrexit\u201d that might lead to an unraveling of the common currency. But she was also unwilling or unable to force Sch\u00e4uble to offer a better deal to Greece. The result, as Varoufakis writes: \u201cStalemate!\u201d Reinforcing the stalemate was what Varoufakis calls the \u201ceurozone runaround,\u201d the repeated protestations from officials at the E.C., E.C.B. and I.M.F. that, while they sympathized with Greece\u2019s plight and agreed with many of Varoufakis\u2019s recommendations, they alone couldn\u2019t change the troika\u2019s course. Jack Lew, then the United States Treasury secretary, similarly offered sympathetic words but made clear that he had no interest in crossing the Germans. The end finally came in July 2015, when \u2014 right after 61 percent of Greek voters decided to reject the latest \u201cbailout\u201d from the troika \u2014 a fearful Tsipras chose nonetheless to submit. Varoufakis resigned after that.Varoufakis does a magnificent job of evoking the absurdities and frustrations of his tenure. This is what it\u2019s like to go from meeting to interminable meeting for six months, trying and failing to negotiate your country\u2019s way out of a terrible impasse.At least, this is what Varoufakis says it was like. I did wonder on occasion how much I could trust his play-by-play. I\u2019m reviewing this book, not fact-checking it, but I couldn\u2019t resist asking Summers for his assessment of the opening scene in the hotel bar. \u201cSomewhat embellished,\u201d was the verdict. Leaving aside whether Varoufakis\u2019s recollections might be more accurate than those of a man who has met with so many embattled finance ministers over the past quarter century that he has probably lost count, I\u2019m good with that. A truth somewhat embellished is still pretty much the truth.An earlier version of this review misspelled the surname of the Greek prime minister. He is Alexis Tsipras, not Sipras.Justin Fox is a columnist for Bloomberg View and the author of \u201cThe Myth of the Rational Market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Environmentalist Is Iceland\u2019s New Prime Minister", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA pacifist environmentalist and expert on Icelandic crime thrillers emerged on Thursday as Iceland\u2019s new prime minister, its fourth in two years, after three parties signed a coalition agreement.Ms. Jakobsdottir will govern in coalition with parties of very different creeds: the conservative Independence Party and the center-right Progressive Party.\u201cIt is important that we try to change the way we work together,\u201d she said on Thursday at a news conference in Reykjavik, the capital, to announce the coalition. \u201cThis agreement strikes a new chord.\u201dAmong them are the Icelandic Pirate Party, which lost ground in the recent elections. Its maverick crew of hackers, anarchists and futurists proved unable, and unwilling, to find a way to join the governing coalition. Bright Future, a hipsterish coalition party from the previous government, failed to live up to its name, having lost all its seats. A year ago, both parties had been seen as fresh alternatives.At the news conference, the previous prime minister, Bjarni Benediktsson, struck an upbeat note. \u201cAll Icelanders will enjoy the benefits of this agreement, both with regards to social security and general prosperity,\u201d he said.Mr. Benediktsson, whose Independence Party has featured in nearly every government since Iceland broke away from Danish rule in 1944, joined the new government as finance minister.Her party also called for the adoption of a new Constitution partly crowdsourced through social media. She, like her party, opposed Iceland\u2019s continued membership in NATO.Politics in Iceland have been mired in scandal since the financial crisis that began in 2008. But some observers said they hoped that the broad-based coalition could bolster stability in the wake of a resounding economic recovery: A tourism boom has driven unemployment down to almost zero.\u201cShe is the party leader who can best unite voters from the left and right,\u201d said Eva H. Onnudottir, a political scientist at the University of Iceland. \u201cBecause this coalition includes parties from the left to the right, their work will be more about managing the system instead of making \u2018revolutionary\u2019 changes. This could work quite well as long as the economy is stable and prosperous.\u201dMs. Onnudottir said she doubted that the adoption of a social media-driven Constitution would occur under this government. Both the Progressives and the Independence Party have strongly resisted the notion of a new Constitution in the past.Ms. Jakobsdottir also stressed on Thursday the importance of gender equality, vowed further steps to counter climate change and expressed a willingness to have Iceland take in more refugees.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Key European Agencies Move to Continent, Signs of Brexit\u2019s Toll", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritical agencies that oversee Europe\u2019s banks and pharmaceutical sector will move from London to cities on the Continent, political leaders in Brussels decided Monday, potentially ominous harbingers of how Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union could diminish the country\u2019s economic clout.The departure of the European Medicines Agency, Europe\u2019s equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, is a blow to the prestige of Britain\u2019s pharmaceutical industry, an important pillar of the economy and an example of the country\u2019s bona fides in scientific research and development.The European Banking Authority has strong symbolic value among cities jostling to become Continental Europe\u2019s financial capital. Its departure serves as a warning of the consequences of Brexit for London, currently the banking capital of Europe, and illustrates the fierce competition from other capitals for the spoils.\u201cThere is no upside for the City of London\u201d from Brexit, said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cIt will lose business, not gain.\u201dIts departure also underscores continuing questions about how British pharmaceutical companies will be regulated after the country\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc, known as Brexit, a shift scheduled for March 2019.The sector is an important one, and enjoys substantially more public support among Britons than finance, the image of which has been tarnished in recent years.Charles Tannock, a Conservative Party lawmaker in the European Parliament, described the relocation of the medicines agency on Twitter as a \u201chuge loss to UK pharma,\u201d adding that he was \u201cheart broken\u201d to lose the organization.\u201cThe relocation of the E.M.A. away from London will be a bitter pill to swallow,\u201d added Rory Palmer, the health policy spokesman for the opposition Labour Party\u2019s lawmakers in the European Parliament. \u201cOur economy will suffer. Our health sector will suffer. Our successful pharmaceutical industry will suffer.\u201cBut most of all, patients will suffer, from delays and the potential loss of access to medicines and research, if we are to crash out of the E.U.,\u201d Mr. Palmer said in a statement, referring to the possibility that Britain might quit the bloc without an agreement to stay within European regulatory structures.Before the discussion on relocation, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, wished all the candidates to host the agencies luck but added on Twitter: \u201cWhatever the outcome, the real winner of today\u2019s vote is EU27. Organized and getting ready for #Brexit.\u201dCompared with the European Medicines Agency, the banking authority is a minnow in size, with only about 150 employees.The decision to move the European Banking Authority, though, underlines the risks facing London\u2019s lucrative financial industry from Brexit. The European Central Bank has suggested it might impose extra regulations on eurozone banks operating in London, in effect pressuring them to move to the Continent.After Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, for example, large numbers of transactions in euros would be taking place outside the reach of European regulators. London dominates currency and derivatives trading in Europe.The decision was a blow to Frankfurt, which is probably a more important financial center and is the home to the European Central Bank, but lacks Paris\u2019s charm or breadth of cultural and entertainment opportunities.Numerous big banks are already expanding on the Continent. Goldman Sachs will add employees in both Frankfurt and Paris, Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman of the investment bank, said in an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro published Sunday.Because of an editing error, a picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated where the European Medicines Agency is moving. The agency, currently based in London, is moving to Amsterdam, not Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece, Looking to Move Past Bailouts, Unveils Ambitious Budget", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 The Greek government on Tuesday unveiled an ambitious draft budget for next year, the latest sign the country is making progress in its economic recovery after years of painful austerity and international bailouts.The government projected that the economy will grow 2.5 percent next year, after a 1.6 percent anticipated increase this year, a further sign of Greece\u2019s confidence as it looks to wean itself off the financial assistance it has relied on for the last eight years. Athens has also tapped international debt markets in recent months, indicating it is able to command the confidence of overseas investors.The 2018 budget also forecast a primary surplus \u2014 cash in the Treasury after expenses and before debt payments \u2014 of 2.4 percent this year, higher than the country\u2019s creditors anticipate.The budget \u201cwill mark the country\u2019s exit from a long period of macroeconomic adjustment,\u201d Greece\u2019s Finance Ministry said in a statement accompanying the proposed budget.The details of the budget will be scrutinized when representatives of the country\u2019s international creditors return to Athens this month, before it goes to a vote in Parliament on Dec. 22.There are doubts, however, over how realistic the government\u2019s forecasts are. This year\u2019s growth forecast of 1.6 percent has been revised down twice, from an original 2.7 percent. And figures released by the European Union\u2019s statistics service in September pointed to a shy recovery in Greece, with growth of 0.8 percent in the second quarter.Still, the budget highlights the stark difference between the challenge facing Greece in recent years and the one it must grapple with today.Greeks have suffered through years of austerity, including cuts to pensions and tax increases, slashing incomes by a third. Unemployment has skyrocketed in that time, leaving more than a quarter of the population jobless at the peak of the crisis in 2013.In the latest budget, however, unemployment is estimated to slide below 20 percent, a marked decline, though still the highest in the 19-nation eurozone.And while the budget itself lays out a series of new austerity measures, from increases in social security contributions to cuts to subsidies for heating oil, there is some additional spending for Greeks. The Finance Ministry pledged a payout averaging 483 euros, or about $570, for 1.4 million Greek households, just days after the country\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, promised \u20ac1.4 billion would be dedicated to Greeks on low incomes.Mr. Tsipras first came to power in 2015 as a leftist firebrand on a pledge to roll back austerity. But he reversed course after the country reached the brink of crashing out of the eurozone and signed Greece\u2019s third international bailout. Since then, he has introduced a series of belt-tightening measures in exchange for loans, but has always insisted that his ultimate aim is to lighten the burden on Greeks.He has also demanded relief from Greece\u2019s crippling debt burden, which is expected to stand at just under 180 percent of gross domestic product next year, according to the budget. The rate remains the highest in the eurozone and has prompted calls by European leaders and the International Monetary Fund for a restructuring, with talks on relief expected to begin the second half of next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Nominates Conservative Economist for Fed Board", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump on Wednesday nominated Marvin Goodfriend, a leading critic of the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions since the 2008 financial crisis, to serve on the Fed\u2019s board of governors.The choice of Mr. Goodfriend, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, is a victory for conservatives who want to reshape the Fed\u2019s approach to monetary policy. Mr. Goodfriend has long argued that the Fed should focus on controlling inflation using a minimalist set of tools.In recent years, he has sharply criticized the Fed\u2019s methods and its goals. As Fed officials sought to revive the economy and drive down unemployment by mounting a large-scale stimulus campaign, Mr. Goodfriend repeatedly cautioned that the Fed was courting higher inflation.In a 2011 interview, he said the Fed should \u201ccommit to making low inflation your priority. That will yield the lowest unemployment rate on average over time and the lowest inflation rate.\u201dIn March, he warned that the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate was \u201ctoo low.\u201dWhile Fed officials, including Mr. Powell, have repeatedly described the Fed\u2019s inflation target of 2 percent as a midpoint, not a ceiling, Mr. Goodfriend has said the Fed should not exceed it.He is also a critic of the Fed\u2019s asset purchases in the wake of the financial crisis. The Fed amassed more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to help drive down borrowing costs. Mr. Goodfriend has said that the Fed should not have bought mortgage bonds, because that promoted economic growth in one sector, which he said was the kind of judgment that ought to be left in the hands of Congress.If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Goodfriend would join the Fed in the middle of an overhaul of its leadership. The top three Fed officials are all being replaced. Stanley Fischer stepped down as the Fed\u2019s vice chairman in October. If confirmed, Mr. Powell will succeed Janet L. Yellen, whose term ends in February. And William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, announced that he would resign next year.All three departing officials were trained economists, while Mr. Powell is a lawyer by training and an investment banker by trade. That increases the value of Mr. Goodfriend\u2019s academic expertise.The nomination could also help to avert a situation in which the Fed\u2019s seven-seat board is reduced to only three members, if Mr. Goodfriend is confirmed by the Senate before Ms. Yellen\u2019s expected departure in February. The Fed has never operated with fewer than four governors.Ms. Yellen described the empty seats on Wednesdayas \u201ca very rare and difficult situation,\u201d though she emphasized that the board would still be able to carry out its responsibilities.Even with four governors, most votes on the Fed\u2019s monetary policy committee will still held by presidents of the Fed\u2019s regional banks, who are Senate-confirmed political appointees. Five of those presidents hold votes each year, alongside all of the members of the Fed\u2019s board.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Upside of Being Ruled by the Five Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. But what if that\u2019s not so bad?For a year and a half \u2014 and more urgently for much of the last month \u2014 I have warned of the growing economic, social and political power held by the five largest American tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.That\u2019s not ridiculous. Over the last few weeks, several scholars said there are good reasons to be sanguine about our new tech overlords. Below, I compiled their best arguments about the bright side of the Five.Tech is inherently messy. The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them. This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow. The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo \u2014 and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides.One benefit of having five giant companies in charge of today\u2019s tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems.Consider Russian propaganda. People have worried about the internet\u2019s capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades \u2014 from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism \u2014 the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation. But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies \u2014 one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs \u2014 it was never conceivable to limit that era\u2019s equivalent of fake news.Today, it suddenly is. Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control.This does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates \u2014 and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression. But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms.\u201cThis is new stuff everybody is dealing with \u2014 it\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of \u201cBig Is Beautiful,\u201d a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies. (The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.) \u201cSo when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier. You\u2019ve got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor.\u201dOver the last few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome \u2014 so why was I including their company in that group?This dynamic \u2014 where each company competes mightily against the others \u2014 suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d with Mr. Atkinson. \u201cAs long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then what\u2019s to complain about?\u201dYou can see this in their product road maps. None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control \u2014 for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop.At the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies. And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways \u2014 with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics.\u201cSo, why pre-emptively say that maybe we\u2019ll be harmed in the future \u2014 that in 2030 they\u2019ll jack up their prices or something?\u201d Mr. Lind asked. \u201cWell, deal with that as it comes.\u201dThe Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale. Thanks to economic dynamics like network effects \u2014 where a product, like Facebook, gets more useful as more people use it \u2014 it was perhaps inevitable that we would see the rise of a handful of large companies take control of much of the modern tech business.I don\u2019t mean this list to get the Five off the hook. How we deal with their efforts to capture more power over the economy and our society is perhaps the next great question facing America. But this is a complex problem precisely because there are both advantages and disadvantages to their size.As I said, tech is messy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Soccer Push Puts a Storied Team Under Murky Ownership", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 When the Chinese businessman Li Yonghong bought A.C. Milan, the world-famous Italian soccer club, virtually nobody in Italy had heard of him.Virtually nobody in China had, either.Mr. Li had never been named to one of China\u2019s lists of the country\u2019s richest people. The mining empire he described to Italian soccer officials was hardly known even in mining circles.Nevertheless, Mr. Li seemed to have what mattered most: money. He bought the club in April for $860 million from Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister, to clinch China\u2019s biggest-ever soccer deal.The soccer club, bleeding money after a spending spree on star players, is seeking new investors or a refinancing of the high-interest loan that Mr. Li took to buy the club. That loan comes due in a year.Chinese corporate records show that \u2014 on paper, at least \u2014 someone else owns his mining empire. That company\u2019s offices were empty on a recent visit, and a sign on the door from the landlord cited unpaid rent. A spokesman for A.C. Milan said Mr. Li\u2019s control of the mining business had been verified by lawyers and banks involved in the transaction.Chinese records also show a series of business disputes and run-ins between Mr. Li and Chinese regulators.China\u2019s emergence as a world economic power came with a ready checkbook for major brand names. Chinese owners now control the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, AMC theaters, the Hollywood production company Legendary Entertainment and A.C. Milan.In the case of Mr. Li, the mines that he told A.C. Milan he controlled have been owned by four different people since last year, according to Chinese corporate records. The business changed hands twice for no money, the documents show.Mr. Li declined an interview request through A.C. Milan. The club spokesman defended Mr. Li on his business disputes, saying that sometimes he was a victim and that sometimes he was not aware of complicated rules. The spokesman also said the club was evaluating several refinancing proposals and was confident it could cover the loan.Chinese spending on soccer totaled $1.8 billion over the past five years, according to Dealogic, a data provider, but Chinese officials are putting a stop to the spree amid concerns about the flight of money abroad.An acquisition of A.C. Milan would be a marquee deal. A decade ago, the club was home to some of soccer\u2019s biggest talents, including Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite, who is known as Kak\u00e1, and Andrea Pirlo. It was a seven-time European champion.But it has not won an Italian championship for six years or a European title for 10. Fans welcomed Mr. Li\u2019s arrival as a potential catalyst. This summer, A.C. Milan began to spend on new players in a way that seemed to signal a desire to compete again.Mr. Li set up companies in the British Virgin Islands and Luxembourg that would put the club\u2019s legal ownership outside China, according to Marco Fassone, A.C. Milan\u2019s chief executive officer. Mr. Li also borrowed about $354 million from the hedge fund firm Elliott Management, a loan he must pay back by October 2018. A spokeswoman for Elliott declined to comment.A.C. Milan remains debt laden and unprofitable, and could have trouble repaying what it owes on its own. It spent about $274 million to sign 11 players this summer, according to the club spokesman, making it among the biggest spenders in European soccer.In August, A.C. Milan had to wait for the transfer of two players it had signed from other teams because it had not deposited the required bank bonds. The club blamed a timing issue for the delay, and the transfers were eventually completed. The team is in seventh place but, with more than two-thirds of the season left to play, must finish among the top four to earn a spot in European soccer\u2019s elite Champions League next season. The team could lose valuable television revenue if it fails to reach that level.It is unclear how much Mr. Li\u2019s wealth might help the club address its troubles.He was initially unknown to the deal makers trying to sell the club, the people involved in the transaction said. He was originally part of a group that included Sonny Wu, a well-known investor who is chairman of the private equity firm GSR Capital, these people said. But Mr. Wu pulled out of the deal.In an email, Mr. Wu said he had not talked to bankers about Mr. Li or his consortium. Rothschild & Company, the investment bank that advised Mr. Li, declined to comment.Mr. Li told A.C. Milan that his holdings included phosphate mining operations in the city of Fuquan in Guizhou Province.But Chinese corporate filings show that the mines are owned by another party: Guangdong Lion Asset Management, an investment company. And Guangdong Lion has had a complicated ownership record over the past two years, involving a number of people with similar family names. (One court proceeding suggests Mr. Li has a relationship with Guangdong Lion, although it is not clear what kind.)Originally, Guangdong Lion was ultimately owned by two investors, Li Shangbing and Li Shangsong, according to filings. Like Li Yonghong, the two men come from the same area of Maoming, a city on China\u2019s southern coast, according to the documents. But in a phone interview, Li Shangbing said he did not know Li Yonghong.Li Shangsong, who declined to comment, sold his interest in Guangdong Lion in 2015 to a person named Li Qianru, according to the documents. The documents did not include personal information about Li Qianru, who could not be reached for comment.In May 2016, according to the filings, Li Shangbing and Li Qianru, sold Guangdong Lion to yet another Li: Li Yalu. The sale price: $0. The filings do not provide personal information about Li Yalu.Three weeks later, Li Yalu sold a half stake in Guangdong Lion to a similarly obscure investor, Zhang Zhiling. The price: $0. Neither could be reached for comment.Li is a common surname in China, and the relationships among the various Lis are unclear. The A.C. Milan spokesman declined to comment.Li Yonghong, the A.C. Milan owner, and Li Shangbing have two things in common.The first is a relationship with Guangdong Lion. A Chinese court cited Li Yonghong and Guangdong Lion in April for failing to resolve a loan dispute with another Chinese company, saying both parties had disappeared. The court did not specify the relationship. The A.C. Milan spokesman said that Li Yonghong had merely guaranteed the loan and that \u201che is a victim in this case.\u201dThe second is an interest in investing in European sports.In May 2016, a day before Li Shangbing sold Guangdong Lion for no money, he started a company called Sino-Europe Sports Asset Management Changxing Company, according to China\u2019s corporate database.Two days after he registered the Sino-Europe firm, another person registered a new company with a strikingly similar name: Sino-Europe Sports Investment Management Changxing Company. The two companies\u2019 headquarters were in the same building in the city of Huzhou.Sino-Europe Sports Investment owns a stake in A.C. Milan as a result of its role as a shareholder in Rossoneri Sport Investment, a Chinese company that is part of the group led by Li Yonghong that owns the soccer club.In the phone interview, Li Shangbing denied setting up either Sino-Europe company and said he did not own any part of A.C. Milan. He declined to answer further questions. A.C. Milan declined to comment on Li Shangbing. The listed owner of the Sino-Europe Sports Investment Management Changxing Company, Chen Huashan, could not be reached for comment.Guangdong Lion\u2019s listed headquarters are in a fancy skyscraper in Guangzhou. In August, the offices were closed, with an eviction notice on the door. Inside, desks and chairs were in disarray, computers were missing hard drives, and maggots festered in a trash can.The phone number listed for Guangdong Lion connects to a woman who said she helped companies register with Chinese regulators.Li Yonghong has an extensive business history, but Chinese records show it includes disputes with regulators and others.In 2004, Mr. Li\u2019s family business, the Guangdong Green River Company, teamed up with two other companies to bilk more than 5,000 investors out of as much as $68.3 million, according to The Shanghai Securities News, the official newspaper of China\u2019s financial watchdogs. They had sold contracts for lychee and longan orchards and promised investors hefty returns, according to the report.Mr. Li\u2019s father and brother were sentenced to jail. Mr. Li was investigated but not accused of wrongdoing, the report said.A.C. Milan said the episode had nothing to do with Mr. Li, adding that \u201che was not aware of the situation until the investigation.\u201dAmid Chinese concerns about deals abroad, China\u2019s purchases of soccer teams with prestige names is likely to slow considerably for some time to come.\u201cIf outbound investment should have the purpose of \u2018strengthening the nation,\u2019 even within the broadest of definitions,\u201d Peter Fuhrman, chairman of the investment bank China First Capital, said in an email, \u201cbuying a soccer team in the U.K. or Italy would hardly seem to qualify.\u201dAn earlier photograph and picture caption with this article were published in error.

{"Headline": "Trumpism Without Trump: A Losing Formula in Swing-State Virginia", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 For Ed Gillespie, Trumpism was an ill-fitting suit.As the Republican candidate, Mr. Gillespie tried to run in a very narrow lane by embracing some of the most divisive elements of President Trump\u2019s agenda while treating him like Voldemort and mostly refusing to utter his name. It was enough to motivate Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in rural parts of the state, but fell far short in Northern Virginia, where the wealthy and well-educated voters who were once reliably Republican continued their march toward becoming solidly Democratic.Lessons from off-year elections can be overdrawn, but the Virginia race strongly suggests that Republicans running in swing states will have to choose a side rather than try to straddle an uncomfortable line. Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt force, all-or-nothing approach has worked in deeply conservative areas, but Republicans will have trouble replicating that in certain states in the midterms next year when faced with a diverse, highly educated electorate like the one in Virginia.\u201cWe now know what a lot of us in the party already knew: The Trump message is a big loser in swing states and he hurts the G.O.P. far more than helps in those states,\u201d Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and critic of the president, said in an email. \u201cSuburban voters don\u2019t like Trump and his antics energize Democrats. The myth of Trump electoral power will now start to melt. A wildly unpopular president is a big political problem for the G.O.P. in swing states.\u201dRalph S. Northam earned huge margins in metropolitan Virginia and the populous Washington suburbs.Another prominent Republican aligned with conservatives called the results, including a number of legislative races, a \u201cclear repudiation\u201d of the party.\u201cI usually resist the temptation to nationalize these races in Virginia, but Trump has been an overbearing presence in this election, and Ed Gillespie chose to run a campaign modeled after the kind of campaign Trump ran last year,\u201d said Mark J. Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. \u201cThis was the first big test in the Trump era of the appeal of Trump-style politics at the state level. The president injected himself in this campaign, so he owns some of it.\u201dIndeed, the president suggested that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s biggest problem was not embracing him enough. \u201cEd Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter Tuesday night.Democrats who were worried about low turnout and a lack of energy can breathe easier. The profile of the electorate in Virginia, where Democrats have started to dominate the counties across the Potomac from Washington, was heavily in their favor, and that advantage has been steadily growing with an influx of immigrants who were repelled by Mr. Gillespie\u2019s message, and by a durable foundation of black voters.In that sense, the pressure for Mr. Northam and the Democrats to win masked the frictions in the party between his more centrist posture and some liberals who criticized his campaign and refused to endorse him.Democrats showed that they could generate energy, even for a low-key candidate like Mr. Northam, but they can draw little from his campaign in terms of a message other than opposing the harshest edges of Trumpism.Mr. Gillespie tried at times to focus on the economy by talking down the state\u2019s prospects under Democrats, but that message did not break through. The state\u2019s unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, and the Northern Virginia region that helped propel Mr. Northam includes some of the wealthiest counties in the country. It did work in rural areas where voters, many without a four-year degree, who once worked in coal mines or in the tobacco industry have not shared in the state\u2019s prosperity.Though each candidate emphasized issues that played to their base supporters, Mr. Gillespie won the Republican nomination by defeating a far more pure Trumpian candidate, Corey Stewart, and Mr. Northam prevailed over the favorite of progressives, former Representative Tom Perriello. So neither party\u2019s voters were inclined toward the candidate who drew the brightest line distinctions.But during the campaign, Mr. Gillespie draped himself in Mr. Trump\u2019s clothes, particularly his tough talk on cracking down on illegal immigration. As a national party leader, Mr. Gillespie had been known for his efforts to expand the Republican tent and find a way to connect with immigrant voters, particularly Hispanics.\u201cI think Ed Gillespie did everything he thought he needed to do to fire up the Trump base, and if the Democrats are fired up and feel united around a cause \u2014 whether a good policy or the politics of Donald Trump and others as too anti-women \u2014 the Trump coalition is not big enough,\u201d said Steve Jarding, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and a Democratic campaign consultant.Democrats needed a victory in Virginia more than Republicans did. Mr. Northam pointed to at least one way. His election showed the limits of Trumpism, and now Republicans will have a choice about how clearly to embrace it.Advertisement"}

Which products contain palm oil?ActivityIn their groups, students should make a list of all the reasons for or against working with the palm oil company to make this orangutan refuge. Then they should try to come to a consensus as a group, and write an argument defending their position, using evidence from the article.If you have time, you can have groups present their positions to the whole class, and then debate or discuss the real-life case study._________Below, we present a range of choices consumers can make to try to protect the orangutan natural habitat \u2014 ranging from boycotting palm oil to pressuring the brands we buy to use only sustainable palm oil.Yet, even when we try to make a positive difference, the best course of action is not always clear. Have students work in small groups to research possible actions they can take as consumers, and then try to form a consensus on what they should do. The class can then hold a discussion on what decisions each group made, and why.Students can make a choice to actually follow through in their own lives on what they decided to do in class.As destructive as the oil palm is to the environment, it may be better than the alternatives. No other crop can yield even a third as much oil per acre planted. And along with using less land, the oil palm gobbles up significantly fewer pesticides and chemical fertilizers than coconut, corn or any other vegetable oil source.Option 2: Reduce your consumption of palm oil or buy only sustainable palm oil.We think that consumers should focus on cutting down unnecessary consumption in general, thus removing some palm oil and other vegetable oils from their lifestyle. With products that are unavoidable, individuals can find alternatives that are either palm oil-free and instead use vegetable oil from a sustainable source, or contain genuinely certified sustainable palm oil.Option 3: Voice your concerns to the brands you buy.Chances are, many of the brands you buy at the supermarket already have a publicized policy about how they use responsibly sourced palm oil.Contact one of the food brands you buy, either via social media, email or letter, and ask them about their palm oil sourcing policy and how they make sure they are purchasing only sustainable palm oil.Option 4: Educate your community about the dangers of irresponsibly produced palm oil.Taking inspiration from Ms. Allen\u2019s letter, students can create social media campaigns to spread the word about the dangers of unsustainable palm oil production.Option 5: Let Malaysia, Indonesia and the other nations where palm oil is produced regulate themselves. _________The rapid expansion of palm oil production in Southeast Asia doesn\u2019t only endanger orangutans, but it also causes health problems for thousands of people, destroys virgin rain forests and contributes to climate change.Have students choose one or more of these articles to read, and then summarize what they learn for the rest of the class. Students can actually use this research with any of the other activities included in this lesson plan._________Have students do research into the economic benefits of palm oil production in Indonesia, Malaysia and elsewhere, and then decide if the economic benefits outweigh the costs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Is Returning to Growth. (Just in Time for an Election.)", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s economy is on track for a full year of growth. Inflation is slowing. The central bank has been replenishing its reserves of hard currency.The country is finally emerging from a difficult recession, and the timing could not be better: President Vladimir V. Putin is running for re-election soon.Mr. Putin is widely expected to triumph in the March polls \u2014 there is no credible opposition, and he has levers of the state, from fiscal largess to official media outlets, at his disposal.Figures discussed on Friday at Mr. Putin\u2019s meeting with government and central bank officials showed strong consumer demand, a main driver of the growth. Retail sales for the month increased 3 percent compared with a year before, according to the state statistics service. The Finance Ministry projects the overall economy to grow 2.1 percent for the year. That would be Russia\u2019s first full year of economic growth since a recession began in 2014.Other economic indicators have been trending in the same direction. Inflation is expected to be about 4 percent for 2017, low by recent Russian standards. As recently as 2015, official figures showed consumer prices were rising more than 15 percent, and ordinary Russians were feeling the pinch. The cost of Russian staples was rising: The price of bread, an important product because of its mythologized status in the Soviet period as a symbol of well being, increased about 11 percent a year during the recession, according to the state statistics agency.But as the price of oil, a major export commodity, has recovered from multiyear lows in 2014, Russia\u2019s central bank has resumed purchases of hard currency. It has been replenishing the reserves its uses to maintain the long-term stability of the ruble.\u201cIt\u2019s a broad recovery, and it will continue,\u201d said Vladimir Osakovsky, chief Russia economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cThere is strong fundamental support.\u201dThe country certainly faces challenges, Mr. Osakovsky and other analysts say. It remains vulnerable to swings in the price of oil and natural gas, for example. The two commodities account for about 60 percent of export revenue and 50 percent of the federal government\u2019s tax base, and a sudden drop in prices could expose wider issues with the economy.Experts also worry that Russia\u2019s banking system is vulnerable. The central bank had to nationalize two midsize private lenders this year, and several banks lost money betting against the ruble in recent years, according to Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Global Markets, an investment bank.\u201cSo far, the central bank has managed to keep the banking system working,\u201d Mr. Tikhomirov said. But, he added, \u201cthe cost of saving these banks is growing.\u201dStill, positive news has been trickling in.In September, Fitch, the credit rating agency, revised its outlook for Russian sovereign debt to positive from stable. Through the year, foreign investors have piled into Russian government bonds, raising the share of Russian debt held by foreigners to more than 30 percent, up from 5 percent.Also helping the recovery was government spending on major infrastructure projects, including a bridge across the Kerch Strait to Crimea, a major gas pipeline to China called the Power of Siberia, and soccer stadiums for the World Cup, which Russia will host next year.That has helped the country overcome Western sanctions imposed during the Ukraine crisis and over meddling by Moscow in the 2016 election in the United States. These \u201csmart sanctions\u201d were in any case narrowly targeting companies and businessmen aligned with Mr. Putin, meant to affect Kremlin insiders and not to slow the overall economy or hasten political change.Mr. Putin now finds himself in a more favorable economic environment before next year\u2019s election. And even though Russians have taken a considerable hit to their pocketbooks in recent years \u2014 real income, or wages adjusted for inflation, declined through the recession \u2014 he remains the overwhelming favorite. In an October survey conducted by the Levada Center, an independent polling organization, two-thirds of likely voters said they would cast their ballots for Mr. Putin.Spurring growth beyond the 2 percent region forecast by the government will not be easy, though.The country will very likely have to agree a series of major economic overhauls in order to bolster its long-term growth potential. The retirement age \u2014 currently 55 years for women and 60 years for men \u2014 will have to be raised, economists say. Without such changes, expansion will remain capped at its current levels, Russia\u2019s central bank chairwoman, Elvira S. Nabiullina, warned this month.\u201cWithout reform,\u201d Mr. Tikhomirov said, \u201cthe future for Russia will be fairly bleak.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Raising Interest Rates, Bank of England Issues \u2018Brexit\u2019 Warning", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cUncertainties associated with Brexit are weighing on domestic activity, which has slowed even as global growth has risen significantly,\u201d the bank declared. \u201cMonetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves toward its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over the next few years.\u201dCentral banking is a mysterious enterprise, not unlike a conclave of seers communicating by smoke signals from a mountain redoubt. Yet this message was strikingly clear: Britain is bound toward trouble, with only the extent of the damage yet to be determined.The rate hike surprised no one, having been telegraphed for weeks. The increase of the bank\u2019s lending rate from 0.25 percent to 0.50 appeared small enough that few expected it to pack substantial economic consequences. The bank presented it as a requisite attack on rising prices. But analysts saw another motive, an eagerness from the central bank to secure room to act again should the economy weaken: It raised rates so it could lower them if Britain requires a fresh jolt of stimulus.Now, nearly a year and a half later, Mr. Carney was taking that easy money back.\u201cIt\u2019s signaling that the bank has a degree of confidence that that immediate post-referendum worry has been put to bed,\u201d said Lucy O\u2019Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, an asset management firm in London. \u201cBut there\u2019s a long game to be played, and Mr. Carney is not convinced that Brexit is going to be anything other than harmful for the U.K. economy.\u201dLifting interest rates tends to increase the value of a nation\u2019s money, as investors arrive seeking higher returns. But markets pushed down the value of the British pound against both the dollar and the euro following the central bank\u2019s action, an apparent reflection of worry about Britain\u2019s economy and its trade with Europe.The clock is ticking toward a March 2019 deadline for negotiations between Britain and the European Union over their future dealings. So far, talks have produced a surplus of bitter recrimination and meager sign of an agreement.Uncertainty is already exacting a price. Nearly half of Britain\u2019s exports are sold within the European Union, a stream of cars, liquor and pharmaceuticals that could confront tariffs absent a completed trade deal. As the markets factor in the prospect of diminished trade across the English Channel, they have pushed down the value of the pound by nearly 15 percent against the euro since last year\u2019s Brexit vote.As the possibility looms that Britain might crash out of the European Union absent an agreement with the bloc, multinational companies are reassessing the merits of centering operations here, imperiling investment.Global auto manufacturers have similarly concentrated factories in Britain while exporting their wares across Europe. But as the potential for an unruly Brexit increases, auto companies are also calculating the merits of shifting production to European locales.If December passes without sign of progress on a trade deal \u2014 an outcome that is more than thinkable \u2014 that will likely accelerate decisions by multinational companies to move pieces of their businesses to Europe.In that scenario, Britain risks a recession next year, said Peter Urwin, director of the Centre for Employment Research at Westminster Business School in London. \u201cAt the very least, the odds are 50-50,\u201d he said.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Central banks tend to lift rates when economies are strengthening. They make credit more expensive so as to guard against the side-effects of rapid expansion, such as rising prices and reckless investment. Yet the Bank of England, Mr. Urwin suggested, appears to be less concerned about inflation than positioning itself to step in with more help if the economy weakens.\u201cThey are trying to get a little ammunition back in the armory,\u201d Mr. Urwin said.Many analysts assumed the bank was essentially forced to deliver the rate hike. Had it held back, that would have surprised investors \u2014 a taboo in central banking \u2014 while resonating as evidence of deepening concern about the health of the British economy.Investors might well have intensified their unloading of the British pound, exacerbating inflation, and increasing the strains facing the economy.Skipping the rate hike also would have put Britain further out of step with policymakers in the rest of the global economy, and especially the United States. The Federal Reserve has been lifting rates to return credit to more normal levels, following years of injections of extraordinarily cheap money.Yet in lifting rates, the Bank of England has slightly added to the headwinds assailing Britain on its continued slog toward Brexit. Retail and auto sales have been weak, even with ultracheap finance. Now, credit terms are likely to tighten along with variable mortgage rates. The cost of capital will climb slightly for companies already reluctant to invest in uncertain times.Given the backdrop, investors concluded that another rate hike is unlikely anytime soon.\u201cToday\u2019s excitement is likely to prove only a short hiatus before the economy returns to another extended period of monetary policy inaction,\u201d declared Matthew Beck, lead U.K. economist with Oxford Economics in London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Russian City, a Time Capsule to Comrades of the Future", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCherepovets JournalFifty years ago, when the citizens of Cherepovets gathered in the same spot, it was to celebrate the achievements of a socioeconomic system they deemed eternal. Pride in its achievements, coupled with an unshakable belief in a future under socialism, infused a letter that they slipped inside a steel capsule and placed in a hollow monolith brought to the square.\u201cToday we are building Communism, and you will live under it,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOur message to your generation: Stay true to Communism\u2019s ideals, and fearless in the fight for the welfare of the working man.\u201dAt last week\u2019s ceremony, in a less ideological Russia but a resurgent one, 500 people congregated to hear those words. Camouflage-clad members of the Defense Ministry\u2019s \u201cYouth Army\u201d stood in perfect formation, staring steely-eyed ahead as veterans of the Communist youth league, the Komsomol, delivered speeches extolling the continuity of generations.The message from 1967, eventually removed from the monolith and preserved in a local museum, elicited not a single smirk. Neither did a new message meant for another audience 50 years from now listing major moments in the city\u2019s history and statistics about its regional clout.Digital SLR and iPhone cameras snapped as it was placed into a new steel capsule, forged, just like the one before, inside the searing blast furnaces of Severstal, the city\u2019s steel plant. From atop a stone plinth a hundred yards away, Lenin looked on.A century ago, the tsarist monarchy was toppled and the Russian Empire replaced with a revolutionary socialist system. The October Revolution (which is marked on Nov. 7 because Russia was on a different calendar when it took place), was celebrated as the Soviet Union\u2019s foundational myth. The Soviet collapse in 1991 ushered in political and economic turmoil that enabled a select few to become fabulously rich while the majority of people struggled, bringing staggering inequality to a country that until recently could by definition have none.President Vladimir V. Putin came to power promising stability, and since 2000 he has sought to merge the various periods of Russia\u2019s turbulent past into a 1,000-year linear narrative of progress, with a powerful state as its guarantor.And so on Tuesday, it is the Communists who will stage a march through Moscow\u2019s streets \u2014 the Kremlin has shunted off commemoration of the event into academia, funding a series of conferences and art exhibitions throughout the year.Valery Belyayev is one of them. Born in 1941 in a village 40 miles from Cherepovets, Mr. Belyayev grew up desperately poor. He was 2 months old when his father left to fight the Nazis in Stalingrad, in a battle that would claim two million lives.Throughout the postwar years, Mr. Belyayev watched life in Cherepovets improve, and it was as the 25-year-old deputy head of the city\u2019s Komsomol committee that he helped write the message that was placed in the monolith there back in 1967.He could not have known then that everything he believed in would fall apart.\u201cWe were convinced that if we could transform our lives at such speed, then of course in 50 years a new era would arrive \u2014 we had absolutely no doubt,\u201d Mr. Belyayev said the morning after the message was read aloud to a new generation, as he and other former Komsomol members reminisced, as they often do, inside their community center.In Cherepovets, a gritty factory town about 300 miles east of St. Petersburg, Komsomol veterans like Mr. Belyayev have their own disco nights, their own clubs and funding from the mayor\u2019s office for events that resurrect a bygone era. For them, the Soviet Union represented a noble idea, and the Komsomol \u2014 whose membership reached over 40 million by 1991 \u2014 was its social underpinning.For 17-year-old Andrei Tolokontsev, a member of the Youth Army who took part in the ceremony in Cherepovets, the Soviet Union was a bloc of brotherly nations. Mr. Tolokontsev has lived all his life under Mr. Putin\u2019s rule, and for him the letters U.S.S.R. conjure up images of the Soviet emblem and its hammer-and-sickle flag, and of the ruthless wartime leader \u2014 Stalin \u2014 whom the young man credits with the country\u2019s development.Standing in the ranks of the Youth Army, which was begun in 2016 by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, means keeping the Komsomol legacy alive, Mr. Tolokontsev said. He hopes to stand in the same spot in 50 years as an army veteran, in a powerful Russia at peace with the world.\u201cThey told us what we should and shouldn\u2019t do in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we wish the same for the generation to come. The situation in the world is tense now, but everything will be resolved.\u201dToday much in the city has changed. There are shiny shopping malls, and a refurbished bus station is opening. But on the outskirts, a creaky tram still courses at 15-minute intervals along a track that runs between crumbling Soviet-era housing blocks and the mighty smokestacks that dominate the skyline, shuttling workers across the plant\u2019s sprawling territory.With the speeches over and the new time capsule sealed, the crowd left to escape the cold. Mr. Belyayev made his way to the old movie theater across the square, joining fellow Komsomol veterans as they crowded into its auditorium.They donned commemorative medals and called each other \u201ccomrade,\u201d then sat bright-eyed and nostalgic as a choir sang songs about a Soviet youth: \u201cLet one misfortune after another threaten us, but my friendship with you will only die when I die myself \u2026\u201dAcross town, Marina Gorbunova showed visitors around the history museum. An exhibition on the revolution had opened, and Ms. Gorbunova told stories about young men from Cherepovets who left to fight in the civil war that followed the Bolsheviks\u2019 overthrow of the provisional government.\u201cThe dream was to abolish class differences, for us all to be equal,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s the way it used to be. There\u2019s a class of the poor, the middle class and the rich. What was all the blood, hunger and cold for?\u201dAsked about the enduring strength of Soviet nostalgia, she paused to reflect. \u201cYouth is always a source of joy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt always seems to us that things were better then.\u201dThe new time capsule will be kept in this museum, stowed away until a new generation, with a new set of ideals, gathers to hear its message.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Tax Bill Takes a Big Step Forward With Committee Vote", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 The Senate took a big step forward when the Budget Committee voted to pass the Republicans\u2019 $1.5 trillion tax package, clearing the way for the full Senate to vote on the bill later this week.\u2022 After a day of deal making, several senators who were on the fence now seem more receptive to voting for the bill.\u2022 Some hurdles still exist, including aligning the Senate version with the House bill and ensuring that the changes some senators want don\u2019t rankle other lawmakers.\u2022 On Wednesday, the full Senate will vote on whether to proceed with consideration of the bill.\u2022 The advancement of the bill came after a day of partisan sparring in which Congress\u2019s two top Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, pulled out of a White House meeting after President Trump attacked them in a tweet.A flurry of last-minute deal making helped garner the support of a few Republican lawmakers who had expressed concerns about the $1.5 trillion package, including its treatment of small businesses and its effect on the deficit.The rapid turnaround underlines the pressure Republicans face to pass a tax cut and notch a significant legislative victory in their first year controlling both Congress and the White House. To help push the effort forward, President Trump visited Capitol Hill for a lunch meeting with Republican senators, where he made promises to some and admonished others.\u201cI think we\u2019re going to get it passed,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House later in the day. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have lots of adjustments before it ends, but the end result will be a very, very massive \u2014 the largest in the history of our country \u2014 tax cut.\u201dRepublicans emerged from the lunch increasingly optimistic about the bill\u2019s fate and played down the concerns that had threatened to bedevil its passage.Three key Republican holdouts, Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, sounded positive about the bill on Tuesday after gaining assurances from Mr. Trump and Republican leadership that those worries would be addressed.Among those who voted the bill out of committee were Mr. Johnson and Mr. Corker, both of whom had said on Monday they would oppose the legislation without changes to address their individual concerns. Mr. Johnson wants more favorable treatment for pass-through businesses and Mr. Corker wants assurances the $1.5 trillion tax bill won\u2019t add to the deficit.We modeled taxes for 25,000 middle-class families. Here\u2019s how the Senate bill would affect each of them.But the meeting with Mr. Trump and discussions with Republican leaders seemed to have swayed them enough to vote to advance the plan.On Wednesday, the Senate will vote on a procedural motion to begin consideration of the bill on the Senate floor. If that passes, the Senate can begin offering and debating amendments to the bill, which is a precursor to a floor vote that could happen on Friday.But there are still hurdles ahead, including the need to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the legislation. And there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of receptivity to the change that Mr. Corker wants made, which would require some taxes to increase if the overall package adds to the deficit.So while the Senate took a big step forward, it still has several more paces to go before declaring victory.\u201cRather than going to the White House for a show meeting that won\u2019t result in an agreement, we\u2019ve asked Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan to meet this afternoon. We don\u2019t have any time to waste in addressing the issues that confront us, so we\u2019re going to continue to negotiate with Republican leaders who may be interested in reaching a bipartisan agreement.\u201dSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, accused Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer of \u201cpettiness\u201d in declining to attend Tuesday afternoon\u2019s meeting.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that Senator Schumer and Leader Pelosi are refusing to come to the table and discuss urgent issues,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe president\u2019s invitation to the Democrat leaders still stands and he encourages them to put aside their pettiness, stop the political grandstanding, show up and get to work. These issues are too important.\u201dThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said in a statement that Democrats need to show up at the meeting if they care about preventing a government shutdown.Senate Republicans\u2019 tax cut would not pay for itself, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.\u201cWe have important work to do, and Democratic leaders have continually found new excuses not to meet with the administration to discuss these issues,\u201d they said. \u201cDemocrats are putting government operations, particularly resources for our men and women on the battlefield, at great risk by pulling these antics. There is a meeting at the White House this afternoon, and if Democrats want to reach an agreement, they will be there.\u201dMr. Schumer, speaking on the Senate floor, pounded on Republicans and Mr. Trump for blocking Democrats from participating in the tax overhaul, saying it would help the rich and corporations instead of the middle class.\u201cIt\u2019s an issue crying out for a bipartisan solution,\u201d he said of the tax rewrite. \u201cThere are a lot of areas we agree. We have to work to find a middle ground that\u2019s acceptable to both parties.\u201d The bill as it stands, he said, would balloon the debt and help hedge funds and lobbyists but not average Americans.Democrats are also worried about a provision in the Senate bill that repeals the requirement that most Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. Dropping the so-called individual mandate would produce savings that would help pay for the tax cuts, since people would forgo health insurance and therefore the government would spend less on subsidized health coverage.Right now, about 4.5 percent of tax filers pay a penalty rather than get health insurance. Here\u2019s a look at who they are and where they live:The Senate Republican tax bill includes the repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, the requirement that all Americans purchase qualifying health insurance or pay a penalty.Senate Republicans have been speeding ahead toward a vote on their tax bill even without a \u201cdynamic\u201d score from the Joint Committee on Taxation that would show the effects of the proposed tax cuts on the economy. That score is important, since it will show the extent to which the tax cuts will boost growth and avoid adding to the deficit.The analysis could roil the tax debate at the 11th hour by giving pause to deficit hawks in the Senate. It would be the first attempt by the committee to project the economic effects of the Republican tax plans. The House passed its bill this month before the committee could complete a so-called dynamic score of the bill.Outside analysts expect the score will show that the Senate bill does not create nearly enough economic growth to generate revenues to offset those lost via tax cuts. Such a showing would undermine Republicans\u2019 claims that the bill would pay for itself.In a letter that was sent on Monday to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the J.C.T. said there is still a chance that such an analysis could be ready this week, perhaps as soon as late Wednesday.\u201cThe Joint Committee staff is currently involved in analyzing the macroeconomic effects of the bill, and is trying to complete the analysis for purposes of producing the estimate of the budget effects\u201d in time to inform debate on the Senate floor, Thomas Barthold, chief of staff of the J.C.T. wrote in a letter to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the finance committee.Thus far, dynamic analyses of the Republican tax bills have failed to match the promises of the party\u2019s lawmakers that the tax cuts would pay for themselves by creating a surge of economic growth and new revenues.Mr. Barthold could make no guarantees that the analysis would be ready in time and he warned that it would not account for any last minute changes that are made to the bill.\u201cWhen we produce these estimates, we subject them to a number of quality checks before releasing them, and cannot guarantee a specific release time until we have completed that process,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Zuma of South Africa told lawmakers in his own country that the situation \u201cvery shortly will be coming clear,\u201d as an array of activist groups and political opponents of Mr. Mugabe urged him to step aside peacefully.Many in this country of 16 million people have known no president other than the 93-year-old Mr. Mugabe, a onetime leader of the country\u2019s anticolonial struggle who traded the liberator\u2019s mantle for the iron fist as one of Africa\u2019s most enduring autocrats.His wife is not shown in any of the photos, leaving some to speculate where she might be.While the military denied that a coup was underway, its actions signaled clearly that Mr. Mugabe no longer exercised supreme power. However, it remained unclear who would replace Mr. Mugabe even if he agreed to step down \u2014 possibly at a congress in December of his ruling ZANU-PF party.The potential successor mentioned most frequently is Emmerson Mnangagwa, a close Mugabe ally for decades until Mr. Mugabe dismissed him as vice president. That action prompted Mr. Mnangagwa to flee to South Africa last week, and it was not clear whether he has since returned to Zimbabwe. Another issue is the future of Mrs. Mugabe, whom Mr. Mugabe had seemed to promote over Mr. Mnangagwa, precipitating the current crisis.One opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, who served as prime minister during a power-sharing government between 2009 and 2013, called on Mr. Mugabe to step down \u201cin the interest of the people.\u201dThe streets of the capital seemed calm on Thursday, but some residents said they detected muted anticipation of change. There were no signs of arrests or violence, but soldiers in camouflage lounged on armored personnel carriers mounted with machine guns, and a lone fighter jet roared above, its mission unclear.The military\u2019s action has sent shock waves around the region. The Southern African Development Community, a regional bloc that includes Zimbabwe, met on Thursday in Gaborone, Botswana, to discuss the seeming slow-motion coup and the apparent impasse that has flowed from it.As fevered speculation swept the capital, Reuters reported on Thursday that Mr. Mugabe was resisting pressure to join some kind of transitional arrangement that would embrace opposition leaders.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s trump card in negotiations is likely to be a broad reluctance among regional and Zimbabwean leaders to embark on a new era as a direct result of a coup.\u201cI think he will play hardball,\u201d Ibbo Mandaza, an author, academic and publisher, said in a telephone interview.Reuters also reported that Mr. Mugabe insisted on remaining in office until the completion of his term next year. Mr. Mandaza predicted that he would probably try to focus negotiations on the restoration of constitutional rule and on the military\u2019s return to its barracks.\u201cI think people are trying to get away from the coup situation,\u201d Mr. Mandaza said. \u201cMy own feeling is that these negotiations will be protracted,\u201d and that Zimbabwe\u2019s immediate future will be \u201cvery uneasy and very uncomfortable.\u201dJeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Alan Cowell from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Vancouver Limits Airbnb, in an Effort to Combat Its Housing Crisis", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 Trying to ease its severe housing shortage, Vancouver moved this week to limit short-term rentals, a measure particularly targeting Airbnb.The new regulations, passed by the City Council on Tuesday, bar businesses from offering short-term rentals through Airbnb and similar services; individuals will be allowed to rent only their principal residences. Suites in basements, above garages or in coach houses can no longer be offered as short-term rentals.The city is struggling with both exceptionally high housing prices and unusually low vacancy rates for apartments and houses. Officials hope the restrictions will free up more housing for long-term rentals.But an analysis of the regulations city officials prepared for the City Council offers no hard evidence that more apartments will become available but it characterized the measures as a way to protect further losses of rental units. And Airbnb said Wednesday that the company might challenge the new rules.Some members of the City Council voted against the regulations, saying they will not ease the city\u2019s housing situation.\u201cVancouver has become more and more unaffordable, we all know that,\u201d George Affleck, a council member, said during the debate. \u201cThis policy is not going to deal with that. It\u2019s going to create a bureaucracy.\u201dThe new regulations also require all people offering their homes for rent in Vancouver to be licensed and pay an annual fee of 49 Canadian dollars. Unlicensed property owners could face a 1,000 dollar fine.Enforcement of the system will rely mainly on officials plowing through Airbnb listings to search for unlicensed operators, although officials acknowledged in a policy document accompanying the regulations that \u201cthis is an imperfect approach\u201d as it may be difficult to coordinate the listings with license data.\u201cWe have 6,000 illegal short-term rentals in the city,\u201d said Vancouver\u2019s mayor, Gregor Robertson, during the City Council meeting on Tuesday. \u201cWe have to respond with these kinds of actions.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s lots of positives to the sharing economy but it is creating other complications and we need to figure out how to regulate that,\u201d he added.A booming economy, foreign investors and other factors have sent house prices soaring in Vancouver. The most recent Canadian Real Estate Association index price for a typical home in the Vancouver area was just over one million Canadian dollars in October.But slightly over half the city\u2019s households lived in rented accommodation, which developers have largely ignored in favor of condominiums. The city estimates its currency vacancy rate at 0.8 percent and Vancouver has some of the highest rents in Canada. That is increasingly making it difficult for people in lower-paying jobs to live within the city and for some employers to find workers.At the same time, the city\u2019s popularity as a tourist destination, and generally high prices for conventional hotel rooms, have made it a thriving market for short-term rentals, the overwhelming majority of which, the city believes, are offered through Airbnb.The city estimates that 27 to 39 percent of places being rented through Airbnb are not people\u2019s homes.Alex Dagg, the public policy manager for Airbnb in Canada, said the company would continue to push Vancouver to allow homeowners to rent secondary suites \u2014 separate units within an individual\u2019s primary residence.\u201cWe really think it\u2019s going too far,\u201d Ms. Dagg said from Toronto before making a presentation to a City Council committee.Ms. Dagg said the company\u2019s data indicated that most secondary suites listed through Airbnb were used by family members, like students returning from college in the summer, and would not end up on the long-term rental market anyway.While she said that the company preferred to negotiate with Vancouver, it would not rule out challenging the ban on suites in court.Toronto, which estimated that about 20,000 properties are were listed through Airbnb and other services last April, will make its final decision about new regulations early in December.Earlier this year, Quebec began requiring that property owners renting through Airbnb and similar services collect a lodging tax, which has long applied to hotels. Ms. Dagg said Airbnb was working with British Columbia to collect similar taxes there.Several American cities have also adopted regulations governing short-term rentals. The new measures in Vancouver will sit somewhere between those of New York City, which bans rentals in apartment buildings and other multiunit dwellings unless the host is present, and Austin, Tex., which requires little more than licensing and rules requiring operators not to create a nuisance.An earlier version of this article contained an incomplete description of the regulations regarding short-term rentals in New York City. They are permitted if the host is present.Follow Ian Austen on Twitter: @ianraustenAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Tough 2016, Many Pollsters Haven\u2019t Changed Anything", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA year after polls broadly overestimated Hillary Clinton\u2019s strength in the decisive Rust Belt battleground states, top pollsters and analysts across the survey industry have reached a broad near-consensus on many of the causes of error in the 2016 presidential election.But so far, public pollsters \u2014 typically run by news outlets and colleges \u2014 have not changed much about their approach. Few if any of the public pollsters that conducted surveys ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections for governor in Virginia and New Jersey appear to have adopted significant methodological changes intended to better represent the rural, less educated white voters who pollsters believe were underrepresented in pre-election surveys.On the other hand, private pollsters \u2014 typically employed by campaigns and parties \u2014 have already begun to make changes. This is especially true among Democrats stunned by Donald J. Trump\u2019s upset victory, but Republicans are making changes as well. The adjustments are already playing out in Virginia, where pollsters will have one of their first chances to put postelection shifts to the test.\u201cVirginia is an important test case for pollsters to try new methods, given some of the issues with 2016 state-level polling,\u201d said Nick Gourevitch, a Democratic pollster at Global Strategy Group, a firm working with the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association to use the Virginia election to calibrate postelection changes and experiment with new approaches.There are a few pollsters in Virginia \u2014 like The Washington Post and Quinnipiac \u2014 that do weight by education, and did so before the 2016 presidential election. Most others weren\u2019t weighting by education before 2016 and aren\u2019t weighting by it today.The disparity can be extreme. Sixty-six percent of likely voters were listed as college graduates in the latest Christopher Newport University survey of Virginia, well above the range of 49 percent to 52 percent in Upshot estimates. Mr. Northam led by six points in the Christopher Newport University poll. A Gravis poll, which showed Mr. Northam ahead by five points, had four-year college graduates at 60 percent of the electorate. A tied Roanoke poll had the college-educated share of the electorate at 57 percent.The relative lack of change among public pollsters doesn\u2019t mean that the pre-election polls in Virginia or elsewhere are doomed to miss by as much as they did in 2016. By most accounts, the 2016 polling error took a perfect storm: Just about everything that could break Mr. Trump\u2019s way appears to have done so. Next time, it could be the Democrats who beat turnout expectations and sway undecided voters. There\u2019s also no guarantee that the stark educational divide of the 2016 presidential election will be as prominent without Mr. Trump on the ballot, or as important with midterm voters, who tend to be more educated.But the lack of change hints at a bleak possibility: a mismatch between the scale of the challenge facing the survey research industry and the capacity of many individual public pollsters to respond.It might seem obvious that the 2016 election would drive public pollsters to adopt big changes. But many individual public pollsters were reasonably satisfied by their results, even though the industry as a whole seemed to get it wrong.It\u2019s not completely unreasonable. Last year\u2019s polling error was an odd one. It was almost perfectly distributed across the battleground states to maximize the electoral consequences. There were large errors in a small number of states where Mrs. Clinton had a big lead, like Wisconsin and Michigan. But elsewhere the errors were more typical, or even nonexistent. Virginia is one such state: Mrs. Clinton led by five or six points in all the final polling averages; in the end, she won by 5.3 points.If pollsters didn\u2019t take any surveys in the Midwest, most or all of their results were probably in the margin of error. Their result might have leaned toward Mrs. Clinton, like everyone else\u2019s, but they could explain that away: There is a lot of evidence that undecided voters broke toward Mr. Trump. And most public pollsters didn\u2019t conduct enough polls, late enough in the race, to be sure of just how well or poorly they really did.Some pollsters did take enough surveys late enough in the race to merit a re-examination, but they didn\u2019t think education was decisive. Patrick Murphy of Monmouth University, for instance, found that weighting by education would have explained only one percentage point of bias in his surveys.But perhaps the bigger issue is that education is a mystery: It\u2019s hard for pollsters to even know if they\u2019re getting it wrong, let alone to fix it.He\u2019s right. It\u2019s not easy to weight by education, and it\u2019s especially tough for pollsters who rely on voter registration files \u2014 the \u201cbig data\u201d that powers most campaigning polling and analytics. Many pollsters use voter file data, rather than dialing telephone numbers at random (known as random digit dialing, or R.D.D.), to conduct their surveys and estimate the composition of the electorate.But the voter file has a weakness: Education is not reliably included on public voter files. To weight by education, pollsters using the voter file have to look elsewhere \u2014 something pollsters who trust the voter file are generally reluctant to do. Not coincidentally, only two of the nonpartisan Virginia pollsters using a voter file appear to weight by education; all but one of the pollsters using random digit dialing in Virginia do, most likely using the census.What\u2019s the alternative? A pollster could ask voters how much education they have in order to match estimates for the likely electorate from some other source, but there isn\u2019t a definitive benchmark for weighting. There still isn\u2019t universal agreement about how many voters in 2016 had a college degree: There\u2019s a wide 10-point gap between the exit poll results and the census postelection survey.The combination of the uncertainty around the true educational composition of the electorate and the reluctance to weight voter-file surveys by self-reported measures has been enough to deter many public-voter-file-based surveys from weighting by education.These same factors pose a challenge to private partisan pollsters. But the pace of change among them has nonetheless been far greater.All but one of the 10 private partisan pollsters interviewed for this article have begun to do something about education, whether by weighting or by other means.For private pollsters, there is a lot more acceptance of the problem \u2014 and more acceptance that they just got it wrong, especially on the Democratic side. The big private polling firms conducted more than enough surveys, in enough states, late enough in the race, to have no illusions about whether their results were meaningfully biased.Some of them were already doing something about it before the election, but now they\u2019re generally doing more. There\u2019s still uncertainty about the exact way to do it, but most private pollsters are persuaded by the necessity of change \u2014 uncertainty is no longer an excuse to do nothing.The debate among private pollsters, especially on the Democratic side, has instead advanced to a different stage: whether weighting by education is enough.The cause for debate is simple. Even weighting by education wouldn\u2019t have been enough to give Mr. Trump the polling edge. One possibility, often advanced by more traditional firms, is that the residual error could be explained by turnout or shifts among undecided voters.Perhaps the polls missed less educated voters in the most rural areas. Maybe they missed those who don\u2019t work in office jobs, in old-economy sectors like manufacturing or agriculture. Or maybe they missed voters with low levels of social trust or a lower propensity to volunteer, who have long been less likely to respond to surveys and may have been more likely to support Mr. Trump in 2016.The possibility of a deeper kind of nonresponse bias is now broadly held in the Democratic analytics world, but it\u2019s nowhere near a consensus across the polling industry. That\u2019s in part because there\u2019s limited public evidence to support it at this stage. It\u2019s also because many traditional pollsters are skeptical of analytics firms with an economic incentive to argue that traditional polling is broken or even impossible. But traditional pollsters mentioned some of these issues as well.Research in this area seems poised to continue for the foreseeable future. But most of these efforts are occurring out of the view of public polling firms. If something is more profoundly wrong with public polling than weighting by education alone can address, it\u2019s hard to see how many public polling firms will be able to do anything about it.Advertisement"}

He said North Korea had traditionally conducted fewer missile tests in winter. The country also needed time to clear key technical hurdles to achieving full-fledged intercontinental ballistic missile technologies, he said.\u201cAlthough the North has not conducted any missile test since Sept. 15, it has continued to engage in missile-related activities, such as engine and fuel tests,\u201d Mr. Cho said at a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cWe have seen some noteworthy activities recently, but we need more monitoring before being able to tell whether they would lead to an actual missile test or provocation.\u201dOn Tuesday, the South Korean military also said it was closely watching missile-related activities in the North.North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, has focused on visiting factories and farms in recent weeks, instead of military-related events. But North Korea has made it clear that despite increasingly crippling sanctions, it remains determined to develop the ability to hit the United States, as well as its allies in the region, with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.The United States restored North Korea to its list of state sponsors of terrorism on Nov. 20, signaling that President Trump had no interest in easing his policy of applying \u201cmaximum\u201d pressure and sanctions until the North agreed to return to the negotiating table to discuss denuclearizing.But the North\u2019s missiles have never achieved a full ICBM range. Nor has the country demonstrated that its nuclear warheads could survive the intense heat and friction of re-entering the atmosphere after a long-range flight through space and hit their targets.Some analysts have said the recent hiatus in missile tests indicated that North Korean engineers still faced challenges such as the re-entry stage. In recent weeks, however, North Korea has repeatedly claimed to be in the \u201cfinal\u201d stage of acquiring full ICBM capability.\u201cThey still need to clear technical hurdles in long-range missile technologies, including the re-entry know-how,\u201d Mr. Cho said on Tuesday. \u201cSome experts have said it will take them two or three years, but we also need to note that the North has been developing its technologies faster than expected.\u201cI would not be surprised if the North declares it has completed its nuclear arms capabilities next year, which is a landmark year for the country, with its government set to turn 70,\u201d he added. North Korea has often celebrated its key anniversaries with major weapons tests.An earlier version of this article misquoted Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon. He said that North Korea\u2019s government, not its ruling Workers\u2019 Party, would turn 70 next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Disappearing American Grad Student", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are two very different pictures of the students roaming the hallways and labs at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering.At the undergraduate level, 80 percent are United States residents. At the graduate level, the number is reversed: About 80 percent hail from India, China, Korea, Turkey and other foreign countries.For graduate students far from home, the swirl of cultures is both reassuring and invigorating. \u201cYou\u2019re comfortable everyone is going through the same struggles and journeys as you are,\u201d said Vibhati Joshi of Mumbai, India, who\u2019s in her final semester for a master\u2019s degree in financial engineering. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201dIn arts and humanities, the figure was about 16 percent; in business, a little more than 18 percent.Many factors contribute to the gap, but a major one is the booming job market in technology. For the most part, Americans don\u2019t see the need for an advanced degree when there are so many professional opportunities waiting for them. For some, the price is just too high when they have so much student debt already.\u201cYou can believe that U.S. bachelor\u2019s students, if they\u2019re good, can go get a job at Microsoft or Google with a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d said Edward D. Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington.Universities and employers are eager to tap the pool of international talent that helps them stay competitive globally, and graduate programs have a financial incentive in attracting them: Demand from abroad is so high, administrators don\u2019t see a need to offer as much tuition assistance.The Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, for example, saw a 30 percent decrease in international applications to its professional master\u2019s program for this semester, according to the dean, Joseph J. Helble. Dr. Helble surveyed more than two dozen engineering deans earlier this year, and three quarters of them said they, too, had seen significant drops in international graduate applications. But enrollment, he said, was not off.Still, trends are not clear.\u201cIf there are one or two more years of comparable 20 to 30 percent decreases in international applications, we\u2019re very concerned about our ability to conduct research and spin off and start companies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned from a competitive perspective.\u201dDan Spaulding, who oversees human resources at Zillow Group, the online real estate company, said that in specialized areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence, his company favors graduate degrees, but for the vast majority of its technical jobs, a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science is adequate. He said he has heard concerns from students and managers about an international chill, but for now the supply of students with computer science skills hasn\u2019t been affected.\u201cA great many of them are coming in with programming skills first and looking to radiate out into other business disciplines, product management, product design,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think going deep academically is not a priority for as many computer science students today.\u201dIn 1994, only about 40 percent of students who were enrolled in computer science Ph.D. programs were from outside the country, according to the Computing Research Association survey.As the economy improved, the percentage of Americans in graduate programs dropped. \u201cGoing to grad school became less of a priority for so many students,\u201d said Stuart Zweben, co-author of the survey and professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University. \u201cYou had to really be interested in research or something special.\u201dThe balance of computer science graduate programs began to tilt toward so-called nonresident aliens in the late 1990s, when well-capitalized dot-coms began scouring for programmers, sometimes encouraging summer interns to drop out of school, Dr. Zweben said.Students from other countries have long seen graduate school as their best path to employment and residency in the United States, and for the industry connections they are not likely to find in their home countries.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to get access from here,\u201d said Ms. Joshi, who is president of the N.Y.U. finance club. She wanted to attend N.Y.U. so she could merge her background in information technology with her interest in the financial industry. She has regular exposure to industry speakers and recruiters.And he would like to see more of them enrolled in the graduate programs. \u201cI feel that\u2019s an imbalance,\u201d he said, \u201cthat absolutely needs to be corrected.\u201dNick Wingfield is a technology correspondent at The Times based in Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Existing Democratic Majority", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe\u2019re all familiar with a certain political geography. Democrats win the cities, Republicans win the rural areas, and the battlegrounds are in the suburbs. In general, Democrats win the denser inner-ring suburbs where there are lots of professionals \u2014 doctors, lawyers, teachers. Republicans win the sprawling outer-ring suburbs, where there are lots of office parks and midlevel corporate managers.Northern Virginia has always embodied this familiar suburban divide. Democrats have done well in inner-ring towns like Arlington. Republicans have done well in outer-ring boomburbs like Loudon County. In 2004, for example, George W. Bush trounced John Kerry in Loudoun County by 55.7 percent to 43.6 percent.But we\u2019re living in an age of global populism, a historic transition as profound as those in 1848, 1905 and 1968. Around the world, the old political divides are being replaced, and political geographies are being redrawn. One way to capture the emerging divide is by using the British writer David Goodhart\u2019s distinction between Somewheres and Anywheres.Somewheres are rooted in their towns and have \u201cascribed\u201d identities \u2014 Virginia farmer, West Virginia coal miner, Pennsylvania steelworker. Anywheres are at home in the global economy. They derive their identity from portable traits, like education or job skills, and are more likely to move to areas of opportunity.Somewheres value staying put; they feel uncomfortable with many aspects of cultural and economic change, like mass immigration. Anywheres make educational attainment the gold standard of status and are cheerleaders for restless change.The thing about this new set of battle lines is this: It redraws the political map. The cities are dominated by Anywheres. The rural areas are dominated by Somewheres. But the growing suburbs are no longer divided. They are Anywhere all the way through. Last Tuesday, exurban Loudoun County went Democratic 60 to 40 percent. That\u2019s nearly the same as inner-ring Fairfax County, which went Democratic 67 to 31 percent.These days, only a tiny percentage of Northern Virginia workers are government employees. Instead, the region is defined by the two big drivers of Anywhere culture: highly educated information age workers and fiercely energetic immigrants. In Bailey\u2019s Crossroads, there are Korean grocery stores near Persian, Indian and Salvadoran restaurants. The Dulles office corridor is a hub of the global economy.Trump\u2019s party is not at home on this ground and can\u2019t play on it. Trumpians just want to wall it off. \u201cDC should annex NOVA and return the governance of Virginia to Virginians!\u201d Jerry Fallwell Jr. tweeted, referring to Northern Virginia, after the election results.Populism has made the Republicans a rural party and given the Democrats everything else. In Virginia, Democrats won by a landslide among anybody who grew up in the age of globalization. Among voters 18-29, they won by an astounding 69 to 30 percent. Among voters 30-44, they won by 61 percent to 37 percent.We could be seeing the creation of a new Democratic heartland, exurbia, and this alignment could hang around for a while. The stain Trump leaves on the G.O.P. will take some time to wash away. But this is bigger than Trump; it\u2019s an alignment caused by the fundamental reality of the populist movement.But does this mean Democratic dominance is baked in the cake? Here I would say, not so fast. It\u2019s worth remembering that the Democrats don\u2019t quite deserve this victory. It didn\u2019t come about because of some masterly Democratic strategy. The Democrats won because the Republicans decided to shrink their coalition.And it\u2019s worth looking around the world and noting that center-left parties are in decline across Europe and beyond. These parties have lost touch with working class voters and are finding they can\u2019t simply replace them with a mixture of identity politics and faculty lounge populism. What we\u2019re seeing around the world is not the rise of left-wing dominance but the decline of major parties and the fragmentation of political parties across the board.The crucial question going forward is what will the Democrats do? Will they make places like Loudon County their heartland, or will they amputate themselves the way the Republicans did, and retreat back to the cities?Here\u2019s how you can tell which way the Democrats are going. If they talk mostly about oligarchy and rich financiers, they are retreating to their base. But if they talk about mobility \u2014 geographic mobility, economic and social mobility, intellectual and spiritual mobility, they are talking the language of the suburbs. And if they have practical plans to enhance universal mobility, the age of Democratic dominance will be at hand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Companies Like Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Love to Go Bust in Richmond, Va.", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Toys \u201cR\u201d Us world headquarters are on a sprawling wooded campus next to a reservoir in Wayne, N.J., on a street that bears the name of the company\u2019s iconic mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe.Instead, the toy company followed an increasing number of corporations \u2014 from Gymboree to a major coal company to a Pennsylvania fracking company \u2014 that are choosing to file for bankruptcy in Richmond, Va.In recent years, Richmond has become the destination wedding spot for failed companies. The United States Bankruptcy Court there offers several features attractive to the executives, bankers and lawyers trying to get an edge in the proceedings.First, Richmond\u2019s bankruptcy court offers a so-called rocket docket that moves cases along swiftly. Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings can be laborious proceedings that drag on for years. Gymboree\u2019s bankruptcy was completed in less than four months.Second, the legal record in that court district includes precedents favorable to companies, like making it easier to walk away from union contracts.But perhaps one of the biggest draws, according to bankruptcy lawyers and academics, is the hefty rates lawyers are able to charge there. The firm representing Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Kirkland & Ellis, told the judge that its lawyers were charging as much as $1,745 an hour. That is 25 percent more than the average highest rate in 10 of the largest bankruptcies this year, according to an analysis by The New York Times.\u201cThe numbers are stratospheric,\u201d said Kevin Barrett, a lawyer at the firm Bailey Glasser, who represented the State of West Virginia in two coal bankruptcy cases filed in Richmond.Companies can file for bankruptcy in a court district where they have an affiliate \u2014 a loophole that allows them to shop for the court they think will provide the best outcome.For an affiliate to be incorporated in Virginia, it can use a \u201cregistered agent\u201d with a local address, according to the state. For its bankruptcy filing, state records show, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us used a Richmond affiliate whose registered agent has an office in downtown Richmond.Representatives for Kirkland & Ellis and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us declined to comment for this article. So did a spokesman for the federal bankruptcy court in Richmond.It\u2019s not just the lawyers who stand to gain from the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy. The bankers and other professionals who helped arrange $3.1 billion in new debt to keep the company operating in bankruptcy will collect $96 million in fees, according to a court document filed by Toys \u201cR\u201d Us.Executives at bankrupt companies typically agree to the high fees, bankruptcy experts say, because they think the cost will have been worth it if the lawyers and bankers can save their business. Kirkland & Ellis, which has its headquarters in Chicago, has a long track record of getting companies back on their feet in bankruptcy.The two judges in Richmond are also known for their expertise. \u201cThe judges understand the complexities of large corporate bankruptcies and can handle cases expeditiously,\u201d said Dion Hayes, a local bankruptcy lawyer.Still, the huge fees can eat into the money that is left over for small creditors \u2014 typically vendors, suppliers and pensioners.In the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us case, dozens of suppliers of scooters, rubber duckies and teething rings could lose millions in the bankruptcy.Linda Parry Murphy, chief executive of Product Launchers, a distributor for several small toy suppliers, said her clients were owed about $1.2 million from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. She worries that they may recover as little as $120,000.\u201cFor some of these clients it was very devastating,\u201d she said.Nationally, professional fees for bankruptcies have been increasing about 9.5 percent a year, about four times the rate of inflation, according to Lynn LoPucki, a bankruptcy professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.Mr. LoPucki said the higher fees were fueled, in part, by court shopping. Lawyers advising troubled companies tend to gravitate to courts that approve their fees, he said. Judges who balk at high fees see far fewer cases.\u201cThey become pariah courts,\u201d Mr. LoPucki said.Down the road, creditors in the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy can challenge how many hours the lawyers bill at the high rates. Another check on the costs is the United States Trustee Program, which helps oversee the process and can object if the legal bill seems unreasonable.The vast majority of companies \u2014 more than 76 percent \u2014 now file for bankruptcy in a different state from where they are based, Mr. LoPucki said.Delaware and New York \u2014 which have long been popular bankruptcy destinations \u2014 still see the lion\u2019s share of the filings.Then in September, the court landed the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us started out in 1948 as a company that sold cribs and strollers out of the ground floor of a house in Washington, D.C.It expanded into the world\u2019s leading toy retailer with about 2,000 stores and an advertising jingle \u2014 \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Grow Up, I\u2019m a Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Kid\u201d \u2014 that could stick in its customers\u2019 heads like glue.Seeing opportunity in a consolidated toy industry, the private equity investors Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust bought the company in 2005 and loaded it up with debt that today stands at $5.3 billion. It was a burden that proved too much to overcome.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us has dozens of affiliates around the globe employing 64,000 people. But when it came time to file for bankruptcy, the company opted for Richmond, where its law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, had success in the past.The law firm had represented Patriot Coal, a coal miner based in West Virginia that filed for bankruptcy twice in four years, most recently in Richmond in 2015.In that case, the most profitable mines went to another coal company backed by Patriot\u2019s lenders, while the others were closed.Mr. Barrett, the lawyer who represented the State of West Virginia in that case, was stunned by the fees.\u201cI remember five lawyers in one meeting, and I joked that meeting cost $10,000,\u201d he said.This year, Kirkland worked on another bankruptcy case in Richmond \u2014 Gymboree, the children\u2019s clothing retailer, based in San Francisco.Like Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Gymboree was owned by private equity and was weighed down by debt.After emerging from bankruptcy in September, the company closed 350 of its stores across the country, but the retailer is still in business.The Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy case kicked off in September at a packed hearing. Kirkland & Ellis set the stage by playing the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us theme song for the judge.The toy company, the lawyer explained, had tried to turn around its business. But it couldn\u2019t afford to sufficiently spruce up its stores and compete with retailers like Walmart and Amazon because it had billions of dollars in debt. He emphasized how Toys \u201cR\u201d Us had brought joy to many children and how the bankruptcy process would help the company survive.\u201cWe are all Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us kids,\u201d he said.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the status of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us stores after the company filed for bankruptcy. The stores remain open. The company did not close 350 stores.An earlier version of this article misidentified the city where the law firm Kirkland & Ellis is based.

{"Headline": "Hunt for a Good Beginning. Then Write It.", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionFollowers of John McPhee, perhaps the most revered nonfiction narrative journalist of our time, will luxuriate in the shipshape prose of \u201cDraft No. 4: On the Writing Process,\u201d a collection of eight essays that first appeared in The New Yorker, his home for more than 50 years. Writers looking for the secrets of his stripped-bark style and painstaking structure will have to be patient with what is a discursive, though often delightful, short book. McPhee\u2019s publisher is presenting it as a \u201cmaster class,\u201d but it\u2019s really a memoir of writing during a time of editorial cosseting that now seems as remote as the court of the Romanovs. Readerly patience will be rewarded by plentiful examples of the author\u2019s sinewy prose and, toward the end, by advice and tips that will help writers looking to become better practitioners of the craft and to stay afloat in what has become a self-service economy.Virtually no part of McPhee\u2019s long career, full of months-long or years-long research trips and hours or days staring at a blank computer screen, resembles the churn-it-out grind of today\u2019s professional web writer. Except the earliest part, which he returns to often: the English class at Princeton High School whose teacher, Mrs. McKee, made him write three pieces a week (\u201cNot every single week. Some weeks had Thanksgiving in them\u201d) for three solid years and encouraged her students to critique one another, to the point of hissing and spitballs. Her constant deadlines led him to devise a crucial tactic: Force yourself to break from \u201cwallowing in all those notes\u201d and determine an ending, then go back to worrying about the beginning. Which leads to the first formal rule he provides, and then only a quarter of the way through the book: When you\u2019re getting nowhere and \u201cyou don\u2019t know what to do. Stop everything. Stop looking at the notes. Hunt through your mind for a good beginning. Then write it. Write a lead.\u201dThat leaves the knotty middle. And structure is where, quixotically, McPhee decides to begin this collection. Maybe he holds off on dispensing advice in adherence to The New Yorker\u2019s unspoken rule, notorious at rival publications though not one of the magazine\u2019s many quirks he lovingly details: Place the nut graf (vital establishing information) no higher than a third of the way into a story. His drawings of circles and spirals and arrows and parabolas that look like track lighting or a set of bottom teeth clearly make sense to him, and give him the navigational tools to row a long way upstream. And they do come interspersed with observations every writer should remember, like \u201cBlind leads ... range from slightly cheap to very cheap\u201d and, on abandoning puns when he ascends from Time magazine to The New Yorker, \u201cWords are too easy to play on.\u201d But the diagrams are likely to baffle many readers. They could have been condensed to one observation: \u201cWhat counts is a finished piece, and how you get there is idiosyncratic.\u201dNo matter. Everywhere you have McPhee\u2019s attentive company. And when he gets to the chapter titled \u201cEditors & Publisher,\u201d exactly one-third of the way through the book, he warms up and loosens up, and makes you hope he won\u2019t stop. Or perhaps I savored every word because my career as an editor at The Atlantic has been spent learning the same rules The New Yorker\u2019s phalanx of editors insist on observing: the exceptional \u201cwhich\u201d; \u201ca\u201d on first reference and \u201cthe\u201d on second; the distinction between \u201cfarther\u201d and \u201cfurther\u201d; sentence-by-sentence vigilance about what the reader will and will not follow. These are the rules I first learned from William K. Zinsser in the college classes on which he would base \u201cOn Writing Well,\u201d and then from my titanically influential boss at The Atlantic, William Whitworth. The precise rules, in fact: Whitworth was at one time the informally designated heir to William Shawn, the decades-long \u201cintimidating sovereign\u201d (and \u201ciron mouse\u201d) of The New Yorker, as were the two editors McPhee principally worked and argued with, Robert Bingham and Pat Crow. McPhee\u2019s reliance on and reverence for these benignly ruthless guides will ring true to anyone fortunate enough to have worked with meticulous, devoted editors like them, as will the desire to pass along to the next generations, medieval-guild fashion, the tradecraft he learned from their incisive comments \u2014 as Zinsser did with us undergraduates; as I do with Atlantic authors, trying to be at once relentless inquisitor and relentless champion, and with my own writing students; as McPhee has done, comma by comma, for more than four decades, with the \u201chalf a thousand Princeton students\u201d who are among the book\u2019s dedicatees.As he becomes more personal and freer with his stories, McPhee also becomes freer with advice: For a far richer and more specific list of alternative words, use a dictionary, not the \u201cscattershot wad\u201d in a thesaurus; every piece of writing can be improved by cutting, or \u201cgreening\u201d as it is known at Time, for which McPhee produced many kinds of articles including marvelous show-biz profiles likely to be unfamiliar to even his most ardent fans (a passage on trying to interview Jackie Gleason is particularly wonderful). He makes his students \u201cgreen\u201d their own articles and even the Gettysburg Address: still a necessary discipline in any kind of writing, even when in online writing the whims of art directors seldom result in the same irritating but useful space constraints as they do in print.In \u201cCheckpoints,\u201d McPhee\u2019s chapter on fact-checking, he demonstrates the bedrock respect for solid information that has guided his career and those of his colleagues. Along the way, he also tells of the three-month ordeal, while preparing a manuscript for his book publisher, involved in trying his hand at the sort of no-stone-unturned verification he relied on at The New Yorker \u2014 an essential skill for today\u2019s writers of non-fake news, however sweat-inducing.It\u2019s the last three chapters, \u201cCheckpoints,\u201d \u201cDraft No. 4\u201d and \u201cOmission,\u201d that will be assigned and reassigned by grateful writing teachers. Perhaps the most generous passages in this generous book are in these final chapters: letters to the student of a fellow writing teacher, Anne Fadiman (whose yearly seminar at Yale was endowed by a former student in honor of Zinsser), and to Martha and Jenny, two of his four daughters, now both professional writers: \u201cBlurt out, heave out, babble out something \u2014 anything \u2014 as a first draft.... As you work it over and alter it, you begin to shape sentences that score higher with the eye and ear. Edit it again \u2014 top to bottom.\u201d As they progress through their own early careers, he gives them the pep talks he needs himself: \u201cJust stay at it; perseverance will change things\u201d; \u201cTo feel such doubt is a part of the picture \u2014 important and inescapable.\u201dThis might be the greatest gift any writer can give another: the infinitely empathetic sense that it really will get easier the longer you stick with it. Or at least a little easier.Corby Kummer is a senior editor at The Atlantic and editor in chief of Ideas: The Magazine of the Aspen Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "OPEC Leader Cites \u2018New Optimism\u2019 With Oil Prices on the Rise", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySaudi AramcoVIENNA \u2014 As officials from some of the world\u2019s biggest oil producers arrive here in Vienna, they have plenty to be cheery about.Oil prices have risen unexpectedly fast of late, surging 20 percent since the beginning of September, providing much-needed money for the strained budgets of the 14 members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.That leaves OPEC members with a quandary: Do they again extend production cuts first announced a year ago? What had seemed to analysts to be a foregone conclusion now looks to be more complex.The group of oil exporters, along with some nonmembers like Russia, agreed to the production cuts to ease a glut in the market and bolster prices. To some extent, that appears to have worked. Brent crude oil, the main international benchmark, is trading at around $64 a barrel, even after falling slightly this week. Some analysts see prices topping $70 next year.While those figures are well below the heights of more than $100 in 2014, they are more than double the price early last year. In a speech welcoming delegates to Vienna on Monday, the cartel\u2019s secretary general, Mohammad Barkindo, spoke of \u201ca new optimism in the oil market not seen for a very long time.\u201dAccording to OPEC figures, the cartel has cut production by about 700,000 barrels a day from a year ago. Russia is holding back another 300,000 barrels a day. That trim, though, amounts to slightly more than 1 percent of global supply.The twin factors have recently helped make a dent in the substantial inventories of crude that had built up on tank farms, sprawling sites where enormous drums hold excess supplies of oil, around the world.\u201cAll these factors prop up a higher price,\u201d said Sadad I. Al-Husseini, a former executive vice president at Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s national oil company, who now runs a consulting firm.Political developments in Saudi Arabia and in other major oil producers like Venezuela are also affecting the market.\u201cI am not saying that Mohammed bin Salman is going to fail or be overthrown or whatever,\u201d said F. Gregory Gause, a Saudi expert and head of international affairs at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. \u201cBut what I always thought was a very stable system is now embarking on changes on numerous fronts simultaneously.\u201dPolitical turmoil in Venezuela, a leading OPEC member, has also raised the specter of a sudden drop in its supply of oil. Production has fallen by 500,000 barrels a day, equivalent to around 20 percent of its output, over the last year. That decline is expected to deepen with the government behind on debt payments and unable to pay service companies crucial to the energy industry.Elsewhere, production and exports have fallen in Iraq because of tensions in the northern part of the country between Iraqi and Kurdish forces.While these trends have helped push prices up, potential developments could send them lower again, from the impact of shale oil producers in the United States to a collapse of the agreement on production cuts.American shale companies, in particular, are seen as the swing producers in the market, able to ramp up output to meet rising demand and take advantage of rising prices. These operators, from small companies to behemoths like Chevron and ConocoPhillips, have streamlined operations and can make money at far lower prices than in previous years. Current prices could lead to a surge in drilling.Higher prices could also strain an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia to hold down production.Russia has been rapidly drilling recently and could add up to one million barrels to its daily output over the next five years. As Western sanctions \u2014 a response to Russia\u2019s military moves in Ukraine and Syria and its meddling in the United States presidential election \u2014 begin to bite, Moscow\u2019s calculation could change.\u201cRussia is the kingpin,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at IHS Markit. Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, he added, \u201cwould fall apart without Russian participation.\u201dStill, most analysts expect OPEC and Russia to extend their production cuts. While OPEC has often moved to stem price declines, it has less of a track record of constraining price increases. Exporters want to make as much revenue as they can, particularly to compensate for recent lean years.\u201cI don\u2019t think many of the OPEC countries think about the long-term aspects,\u201d said Bill Farren-Price, president of Petroleum Policy Intelligence, a market research firm. \u201cWhat they think about is how do we fulfill next year\u2019s budget.\u201d\u201cIf we can have a few months of higher prices,\u201d he added, \u201csurely that is a good thing.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War With Canada", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOTTAWA \u2014 Why is President Trump picking on Canada?Canada has long been the United States\u2019 best customer, buying more American-made goods and services than any other country \u2014 more than China, Japan or Britain. American trade with Canada totaled $627.8 billion in 2016; the United States had a $12.5 billion trade surplus.But trade relations have nose-dived since Mr. Trump took office. The president is throwing red meat to his base \u2014 much of which feels left behind by the modern economy \u2014 by attacking Canada and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada is an easy target.In the spring, the Trump administration imposed tariffs costing potentially hundreds of millions of dollars on Canadian softwood-lumber imports, escalating a decades-long dispute between American and Canadian lumber companies. This fall, following a complaint by Boeing, the Commerce Department announced it would recommend a 300 percent punitive tariff on Canadian-made Bombardier CSeries passenger aircraft, even though Boeing makes no equivalent product and receives indirect subsidies from the United States government.Mr. Trump also prompted renegotiations of Nafta, which he criticized relentlessly during his campaign as \u201cthe worst trade deal ever signed.\u201d Started in August and scheduled to run until March, the Nafta talks have been shocking to many Canadians as the United States has issued a series of unreasonable demands that no Canadian or Mexican government could accept.The Trump administration is reportedly asking that Nafta be renegotiated every five years, which would create a state of perpetual uncertainty for business and deter investment. Washington also wants to eliminate Nafta\u2019s binational dispute-settlement panels, a red line for Canada because Canadian businesses would have to rely on United States courts, which they don\u2019t necessarily trust.Further, Washington is apparently insisting on \u201crules of origin\u201d that would require Canadian and Mexican vehicles to contain no less than 50 percent American parts and services for duty-free entry into the United States, an onerous demand benefiting American producers. Washington is also asking that such vehicles contain at least 85 percent of parts and services from the three Nafta countries. The existing 62.5 percent has allowed for the use of cheaper supplies outside the trading group.The United States representatives are also reportedly demanding unlimited access for American businesses to all Canadian government procurement contracts while limiting Canadian access to United States government contracts.Nafta has its faults: Many American and Canadian companies moving production south to Mexico, causing job losses in the United States and Canada; salary stagnation caused by low-wage competition from Mexico; small farms in Mexico pushed out of business; and exploitation of Mexican factory workers. While these failures tend to be highly visible \u2014 notably, shuttered plants \u2014 the benefits of Nafta, including lower consumer prices, are less noticeable and are distributed across the entire economy.Since Nafta came into effect in 1994, trilateral trade has quadrupled and investment across the continent has surged. Supply chains created by relatively high-cost producers in the United States and Canada and lower-cost producers in Mexico have enhanced the competitiveness of North American companies. Nafta has enabled Mexico to export products, not only people, a major United States and Mexican objective.Nafta has been a net benefit for all three countries. Rapid technological change and significantly expanded trade with China have had a far greater impact on the working people of Mr. Trump\u2019s base than Nafta.Still, Nafta, which predates the smartphone era, needs modernizing. Electronic commerce is not covered by the agreement. Enhanced regulatory cooperation would improve productivity. And modern labor rights and environmental policies would update the agreement and enhance its appeal.The Trump administration has three choices: walk away from Nafta altogether, which is what many Canadians think is the administration\u2019s lightly disguised objective; insist on its onerous proposals in the hope that Canada or Mexico will accept the unacceptable or themselves abandon the talks; or negotiate in good faith for outcomes that benefit all parties.Washington\u2019s agreement last month to extend the negotiations until March is a hopeful sign. The Canadian government has made clear that it won\u2019t abandon the talks even if they have to be kicked down the road past the 2018 Mexican presidential election and the midterm congressional elections in the United States. Canada will not provoke the Trump administration, but it also won\u2019t fold under pressure.If Nafta were to be abrogated, it would be costly for the Americans. Resentment of the United States by its major trading partners would mount, and cooperation across the board would suffer. Tariffs would be reimposed on United States imports and exports. Manufacturing jobs would be jeopardized in many of the states that elected Mr. Trump president. Global supply chains would be disrupted, making American (and Canadian and Mexican) industry less competitive with European and Asian companies.Canada will take every opportunity to cooperate, but it will also adapt to life with a highly mercantilist neighbor. Canada will probably diversify trading partners, and double down on agreements with the European Union and the nascent 11-member Trans-Pacific Partnership. Further bilateral trade agreements will be forged with Japan and China, which is very interested in Canadian resources. Canada will partner with Mexico while waiting for the day that Washington is ready to rejoin its friends.Congress has the constitutional power to regulate commerce with foreign nations. Better for congressional leaders to exercise that power now to prevent harm than to use it later to pick up the pieces after an entirely avoidable collapse of Nafta.Paul Heinbecker, a former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations and to Germany, is a distinguished fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Unwanted New Title: \u2018President of the Rich\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 From the all-powerful president with the infallible touch, Emmanuel Macron has become the \u201cpresident of the rich,\u201d an elitist dispensing fiscal goodies to the wealthy. At least that is what parliamentarians, some economists, television interviewers and newspapers have been calling him in recent weeks.Barely six months into his presidency, Mr. Macron has been brought down from the heights to places many French are deeply suspicious of: the corporate suite and the banker\u2019s office. Over and over that unflattering label \u2014 \u201cpresident of the rich\u201d \u2014 has been affixed to the young leader.\u201cYou are committing violence with your policy. It\u2019s you that are going after the poor to give to the rich!\u201d thundered Fran\u00e7ois Ruffin, a firebrand of the leftist France Unbowed party.But he has also maintained the essence of what he wanted: more flexibility for individual firms in carving out agreements with workers. Mr. Macron\u2019s plans have sailed through a Parliament with a big presidential majority, against a fragmented right and left.\u201cFor now, he\u2019s winning the game, no point in hiding it,\u201d Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of France Unbowed, said in a television interview last weekend.Mr. Macron\u2019s encounters with workers are often tense. \u201cDo-nothings,\u201d he called critics in one recent speech; \u201cpeople who are nothing,\u201d he said in another, referring to those \u201cone passes\u201d in train stations.\u201cThis business of being the president of the rich,\u201d said Hugo Sevillia, 23, a student at Centrale Sup\u00e9lec in Saclay. \u201cIt makes people mad who aren\u2019t doing well, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair.\u201dMuch of the hue and cry is over Mr. Macron\u2019s proposal to reduce a tax on the rich known here as the \u201cSolidarity Tax on Wealth\u201d \u2014 in French, the Imp\u00f4t de Solidarit\u00e9 sur la Fortune, or I.S.F.The government\u2019s income from the tax is relatively modest. The tax\u2019s real value is its symbolism \u2014 an emotional, longstanding one \u2014 in a country where wealth is often perceived as synonymous with injustice.No president until Mr. Macron has dared go after the wealth tax since it was created, in a different form, under the first government of President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, a Socialist, in 1982.The tax aims at assets \u2014 financial, property and otherwise \u2014 above $1.52 million (1.3 million euros). Everybody with holdings above that sum has had to pay up, on a progressive scale: The more you own, the more you pay.This type of wealth tax has been eliminated almost everywhere else in the developed world. In Sweden, among other places, the elimination has had no effect on inequality, and there are signs it has actually spurred growth.Meanwhile, in France the wealth tax has accounted for less than 2 percent of the government\u2019s total tax revenues. Mr. Macron and his economists contend it is nonetheless important to reduce the tax because the tranche is sliced off those accumulating capital. Capital gains will now be taxed at a flat 30 percent under Mr. Macron\u2019s plan, nearly half the previous maximum rate.Mr. Macron argues that he is merely trying to free capital for much-needed investment in France\u2019s slow-growth, high-unemployment economy.His policies have nothing to do with setting one class off against another \u2014 far from it, he insists. It is all about overturning the fraying, much despised, but paradoxically cherished status quo.In a defiant recent television interview, Mr. Macron \u2014 a president who has by now shown himself unafraid of sacred cows \u2014 clenched his fists, waved his arms and showed no signs of retreating.Still, for all the criticism, some have defended his intentions. \u201cThe I.S.F. is purely a symbol,\u201d said the ex-Harvard economist Philippe Aghion, now at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, and one of Mr. Macron\u2019s principal economic advisers.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop being obsessed by the rich, and start being obsessed by poverty traps,\u201d Mr. Aghion said.\u201cPresident of the Rich\u201d is a \u201cthoroughly illegitimate charge against him,\u201d said Jean-Louis Bourlanges, a centrist deputy who is sympathetic to Mr. Macron, though not in his political movement.\u201cIt\u2019s explained by the deep hostility of the French toward the rich,\u201d Mr. Bourlanges said. \u201cAs soon as something is seen as favoring the rich, it\u2019s also seen as an attack on the poor.\u201dBut Mr. Bourlanges added that it was \u201cidiotic\u201d for Mr. Macron \u201cto present the suppression of the Solidarity Wealth Tax as the first thing you do. He should have said, we\u2019ll suppress it progressively.\u201dMr. Macron has now eliminated non-real-estate assets from the tax, cutting it by some $3.7 billion.\u201cIsn\u2019t this just a gift to the rich?\u201d Mr. Macron was asked during the lengthy television interview, in language that echoed the attacks in parliament.\u201cAre you not the \u2018President of the Rich?\u2019\u201d he was asked. Mr. Macron bristled.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in this French jealousy which says, \u2018There are rich people; let\u2019s tax them and we will all feel better,\u2019\u201d Mr. Macron said testily.He pointed to news reports showing that \u201cthe big French fortunes don\u2019t even pay the Solidarity Wealth Tax,\u201d because they simply leave the country. \u201cSo this is classic French hypocrisy,\u201d he said.\u201cIn order for our society to do better,\u201d Mr. Macron argued, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to have people who succeed, and people will then say, that\u2019s great.\u201dBut then he used a metaphor for the rich that left him open, again, to the elitist charge. He called them \u201cthe first in the rope line.\u201dMr. Macron, while vowing that \u201cthe others who are fragile, we will protect them,\u201d added that \u201cif we throw stones at the first in the rope line, it\u2019s the whole line that collapses.\u201dWhile Mr. Macron\u2019s phrase was \u201cclumsy\u201d and \u201ca bit arrogant,\u201d he was nonetheless on \u201cabsolutely the right path\u201d in policy terms, said Mr. Bourlanges, the lawmaker.\u201cMacron is like a test-tube baby,\u201d he said. \u201cHe came out of school and then it was a succession of bubbles. He lacks the popular touch.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a firebrand of France Unbowed, a leftist party. He is Fran\u00e7ois Ruffin, not Rufin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Busts a $3 Billion Underground Bank as It Tightens Its Grip on Money", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The money came from all over China \u2014 its wealthy southern and eastern coasts as well as the arid northwest \u2014 as thousands of people scrambled to circumvent the country\u2019s strict controls on wealth.In the end, more than 10,000 people had used an underground bank to effectively funnel $3 billion out of the country before the authorities put a stop to it, Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, reported on Thursday.The discovery of the underground bank in Shaoguan, in the southern province of Guangdong, demonstrates the furtive lengths that Chinese citizens go to in order to skirt government limits and get more of their money out of the country.The Chinese police have detained seven people believed to be involved in the bank, according to the Thursday reports. The authorities discovered 148 \u201cillegal and fraudulent accounts\u201d from the bank, involving more than 10,000 people, the Xinhua report said.Underground banks are illegal but common in China. According to China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security, underground banks handled more than $137 billion in transactions last year. There are also lawful ways of moving princely sums out of China without surpassing government limits: directing money to casinos in Macau \u2014 the only Chinese territory where casino gambling is legal \u2014 as well as using credit cards to buy luxury goods abroad and purchasing insurance policies that can be cashed out overseas.President Xi Jinping has made it a top priority to keep more money in China. His government has shut down platforms that trade cryptocurrencies; announced controls on outbound investment in property, entertainment and soccer; and imposed curbs on payments overseas.Much of China\u2019s underground banking activity is centered in cities that border Hong Kong and Macau, special administrative regions of China that are governed by their own laws.In Shaoguan, the police were alerted to a suspicious bank account that was opened in 2011 in the city by a Mr. Zhong, a resident from the southern city of Zhuhai that borders Macau, according to Guangzhou Daily, an official newspaper. It did not further identify Mr. Zhong. After almost no activity for years, there were 121 transactions involving $15 million in 2016, prompting the authorities to look more closely at who was involved.Ultimately, the Xinhua report said, the authorities discovered that the people running the underground bank had illegally bought and stole the identity documents of more than 200 people to open the fake accounts that underpinned the enterprise. News reports did not disclose detailed information about how the underground bank worked.The Shaoguan government and the police did not respond to requests for comment.The trail appeared to lead to Macau, according to the news reports. The suspicious bank account that prompted the investigation was opened specifically for a gambler in Macau called Mr. Peng to transfer money, Xinhua said. \u201cSeveral members of the criminal gang\u201d then converted the renminbi into Hong Kong dollars for Mr. Peng, according to the report. Hong Kong has its own currency, which tracks the value of the United States dollar.The Xinhua report did not offer details about Mr. Peng.Macau is under pressure to keep a tight rein on capital outflows. Most recently, it installed automated teller machines with facial recognition software to monitor transactions for people using Chinese bank cards, according to Macau Daily Times.The Xinhua report acknowledged that underground banks are \u201cseductive,\u201d especially for people who struggle to get financing, but warned that \u201cthe people will suffer tremendous loss\u201d if the banks abscond or cheat their clients.Zhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}

Come up with conjectures based on this graph. Probe whether they are possibly true, and if not, change your conjecture. We continue to welcome your responses to this graph._________Stat Nuggets for \u201cLabor-force Participation Rate\u201dTIME SERIES GRAPHA graph that shows how a numerical variable changes over time.In the Labor-force Participation Rate graph, the variable was labor-force participation percentage and the graph shows how it changes from 1980 - 2017 for seven selected O.E.C.D. countries.AXES SCALESTypically, the axes of a graph start at zero. But, if there is no data in the lower values, an axis could start at a greater value.In the Labor-force Participation Rate graph, the x-axis starts at 1980. We are given no reason 1980 is selected. This may be when labor-force participation percentages started to fall internationally. The y-axis starts at 88 percent. This was probably selected since no labor-force participation percentage is less than 88 percent. If the graph had started at zero percent, the countries\u2019 lines would have been at the top of the graph and the differences between countries would have looked less noticeable.NUMBER VS. PROPORTIONNumber is the count of some group. Proportion is the count of some characteristic of a group divided by the total number of members in the group. Proportions can be expressed as percentages, decimals or fractions.In the Labor-force Participation Rate graph, the y-axis displays the percentage of labor-force participation for men age 25 - 54. Those values are calculated by dividing the number of men who are either working or looking for work (members of a group) by the total number of men age 25 - 54 (the entire group). The members of the group not included in the percentage are those who are not working or not looking for work.We see that the percentage of men working or looking for work is decreasing over time. But, we do not know if the number of men who are working or looking for work is decreasing. Why is this so? Here\u2019s an example. If the labor-force participation percentage decreases from 90 percent to 80 percent, but the number of men increases from 100 million to 120 million, the number of men working or looking for work increases from 90 million to 96 million. The percentage decreases (90 percent to 80 percent), but the number increases (90 to 96 million). In this graph, because we only know the percentage of men participating in the labor force, we cannot compare the number of men participating in the labor force._________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Mugabe Under House Arrest as Rule Over Zimbabwe Teeters", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the capital, Harare, about half a dozen tanks were stationed around strategic government buildings and intersections. But shops and banks were open, and most people carried on business as usual, perhaps because the apparent coup had occurred without violence or resistance. Soldiers blocked the main road leading to the airport, which Mr. Mugabe, 93, had renamed after himself just last week.The military did not say whether Mr. Mugabe had been removed as president, leaving open the possibility that he may be kept on during a period of transition. But whatever happens to him, it appeared increasingly clear on Wednesday that an era was coming to a close in Africa.Power appeared to be slipping from Mr. Mugabe as outside forces were determining his fate.For nearly four decades, Mr. Mugabe exercised unrivaled authority by distributing healthy doses of power, land \u2014 and fear. He crushed dissent by overseeing the massacre of thousands of civilians in the 1980s and effortlessly outmaneuvered both rivals in his party and in the opposition. His dominance was so overwhelming that, even in his 90s and weakened by age, potential successors showed extreme deference, choosing to stay quiet until his eventual death.President Jacob Zuma of South Africa said that he spoke on the phone with Mr. Mugabe on Wednesday morning, and that the Zimbabwean leader had said he was fine but confined to his house in Harare.Negotiations were underway between Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s allies and opposition parties to possibly form an interim government that would soften international criticism of the military takeover.No resistance could be seen from forces that had long remained loyal to the president, including the presidential guard and the vast network of secret intelligence that had helped Mr. Mugabe keep a grip on the nation, despite a crumbling economy and diplomatic isolation.A soldier mounting a military tank at a major intersection said, \u201cWe are here to put things right in the country.\u201dThough a veteran of the governing ZANU-PF party, Mr. Mnangagwa was also known to be on good terms with Morgan Tsvangirai, the longtime leader of the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change.\u201cWe just changed the head of the train,\u201d Chris Mutsvangwa, a close ally of Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s who is also the leader of the war veterans association and a former minister under Mr. Mugabe, said in a phone interview.Mr. Mutsvangwa said that, in a possible interim government, Mr. Mnangagwa would serve as president and Mr. Tsvangirai as prime minister.\u201cIt\u2019s more of a coalition rather than a coup,\u201d Mr. Mutsvangwa said. \u201cMugabe was senile and incapacitated, and things were being run behind the scenes by a small coterie and his wife.\u201dOn Wednesday, opposition officials said that no decision had been made about a new coalition, adding that they remained wary of entering into any alliance with Mr. Mnangagwa.\u201cWe have to make sure we aren\u2019t being sold a dummy,\u201d Elias Mudzuri, a deputy president of the Movement for Democratic Change, said by phone. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sure of the endgame. They say this is not a coup, but, to us, it\u2019s a coup.\u201dAn aide to Mr. Tsvangirai \u2014 who has been in South Africa for medical treatment \u2014 said that the opposition leader was on his way back to Zimbabwe on Wednesday.Experts said that efforts to form a unity government were an attempt to blunt criticism of the coup and win the support of foreign governments and international creditors at a time when Zimbabwe\u2019s coffers are empty.\u201cMnangagwa\u2019s biggest challenge is legitimacy,\u201d Dewa Mavhinga, a researcher on Zimbabwe for Human Rights Watch, the advocacy group, said by phone from Harare. \u201cThat\u2019s why he is likely to try to accommodate Tsvangirai.\u201dThough now viewed as a pariah in the West, Mr. Mugabe is seen by many Africans as a freedom fighter and an elder statesman, having helped liberate his country from colonialism and white-minority rule.In 1965, the white leadership of what was then the British colony of Southern Rhodesia declared independence \u2014 setting off worldwide condemnation and a guerrilla uprising by rival factions, including Mr. Mugabe\u2019s.The strife ended with a negotiated settlement in 1979 before a new nation \u2014 Zimbabwe, under black-majority rule \u2014 achieved independence in 1980. Mr. Mugabe is the only leader Zimbabwe has had.Early Wednesday, after the military seized the state broadcaster, ZBC, two uniformed officers read a short statement in which they denied carrying out a coup.They also said that they had taken Mr. Mugabe in custody to protect him and that they were \u201conly targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country.\u201dThe message appeared intended to provide a palatable exit for Mr. Mugabe, or to keep him on during a period of transition. Despite his long, troubled rule and increasingly poor health, Mr. Mugabe, as one of Africa\u2019s last liberation leaders, commanded respect inside the ruling party and on the continent.On Wednesday, Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s allies reinforced their longtime message that Mr. Mugabe had been led astray by his wife and other members of a faction called the G-40. Leading figures of that faction were reportedly arrested in Harare on Wednesday.But Mr. Mnangagwa has a longstanding reputation as a sometimes brutal ally of Mr. Mugabe. He is believed to have played a key role in the Gukurahundi massacres of the Ndebele ethnic group in the 1980s.\u201cHe represents to many of us the very pathology of anti-democratic tendencies in ZANU-PF,\u201d said Ibbo Mandaza, an academic and businessman active in opposition politics. \u201cThere is a na\u00efve expectation that anybody other than Robert Mugabe will be better. But a military coup is bad news.\u201dIn central Harare, business went on as usual on Wednesday. Shops were open and long lines formed outside banks, which have been low on cash for two years. Some people openly praised the military while others feared speaking amid the uncertainty.Tendai Muganhu, 43, a street vendor, said, \u201cI am happy because I know whoever will come into power won\u2019t be like Mugabe, won\u2019t chase vendors from streets, but will certainly improve our lives.\u201dJeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Norimitsu Onishi from Johannesburg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Plan Burdens Blue-State Republicans and Their Districts", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Mr. Schwartz, 72, said he is deeply wary of the House bill. \u201cI\u2019m not happy,\u201d he said, \u201cif they take away New Jersey\u2019s deductions.\u201dIn the dense suburbs of northern New Jersey, where property values are high and local taxes keep climbing, Mr. Schwartz has ample company in his unease. It is in places like West Caldwell, in New Jersey\u2019s 11th Congressional District, where Republicans are facing the most furious internal resistance in their drive to overhauling the tax code \u2014 and the greatest political risks if they succeed.Indeed, Republican proposals to raise revenue by targeting high-tax states dominated by Democrats could endanger Republicans in districts like this one, particularly in states like New Jersey, New York and California, perhaps putting the party\u2019s majority in Congress in peril.Representative Lee M. Zeldin of New York, a Republican from a similar district on Long Island, said it would be impossible for him to vote for the bill in its current form. Mr. Zeldin said he would favor a \u201cbig, beautiful tax cut,\u201d but not one that took aim so directly at blue-state taxpayers.\u201cI view it as a geographic redistribution of wealth,\u201d Mr. Zeldin said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking more money from a state like New York, to pay for a deeper tax cut elsewhere.\u201dThe tax bill, pushed by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the House\u2019s chief tax writer, would cut tax rates for many individuals and businesses, but would void or sharply limit a range of popular deductions. Of particular concern in New Jersey are proposals to put a cap of $10,000 on the property taxes that can be deducted at the federal level; to eliminate the deduction for state and local income taxes; and to restrict the mortgage interest deduction to loans of $500,000 or less.The changes to deductions would raise more than $1 trillion in additional revenue over 10 years, to help offset the $2 trillion cost of lowering tax rates and doubling the standard deduction.The House Ways and Means Committee will begin considering and amending the bill on Monday, with the goal of passing it out to the House floor by the end of the week. The Senate is expected to introduce its own version of the bill in a few days.Most Republicans from New Jersey and New York have opposed the legislation in its earliest drafts, forcing congressional leaders to advance it with the narrowest of majority votes. Republican leaders in both states\u2019 legislatures denounced the bill, and Kim Guadagno, the Republican nominee for governor of New Jersey, said in an interview that she would push the state\u2019s congressional delegation to \u201ccondemn it.\u201dJon M. Bramnick, the Republican leader in the New Jersey State Assembly, said the party\u2019s polling consistently found taxes to be a singular and overwhelming issue for voters. The state\u2019s members of Congress, he said, had to fight fiercely for its fiscal interests.\u201cWhen you represent New Jersey, it\u2019s extremely important to stand up for New Jersey,\u201d said Mr. Bramnick.But key blue-state Republicans face an agonizing balancing act, weighing their ambition to deliver broad tax cuts with the narrower interests of their districts. Where most Republicans take it as an article of faith that passing a tax bill would buoy the party in 2018, lawmakers in these areas worry that a law burdening the suburbs would doom them.Outside her office in a development of high-end stores and condos in Livingston, N.J., Vicki Stout, 55, said she had voted for Mr. Frelinghuysen in the past, but might reconsider her support. Ms. Stout, a real estate agent who is not registered with a political party, said the tax bill would both snarl her own taxes and deter potential clients from purchasing homes.\u201cIt\u2019s going to have people move out of the state, if it passes,\u201d Ms. Stout said of the bill. \u201cIt makes absolutely no sense.\u201dEven voters who may support the legislation over all acknowledge that it will come at a cost to the district \u2014 and to them personally. Joe Giannotti, a contractor, estimated that he would pay several thousand dollars more in taxes if he lost the deductions that are currently under the knife.But Mr. Giannotti, who said he usually votes Republican and supports President Trump, said it would be worth it.\u201cIt would hurt this area, but it\u2019s important for the good of the country,\u201d Mr. Giannotti said, arguing that New Jersey Democrats should respond by cutting local taxes: \u201cLet\u2019s get the Democrats to get their policies in line.\u201dAn aide to Mr. Frelinghuysen did not respond to a request for an interview. But Mr. Frelinghuysen, who chairs the powerful Appropriations Committee, has emerged as something of a bellwether figure in New Jersey. Though he is viewed locally as a moderate, Mr. Frelinghuysen has taken a series of perilous votes to back the agenda of Republican leaders, supporting both the tax plan and an unpopular bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Mr. Frelinghuysen, who has served in Congress since 1994, is facing his first concerted challenge in years after his district split almost evenly between Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump in 2016. Democratic Party polling has found the tax issue to be a potent one in districts like his, with voters inclined to view it as a giveaway to the extremely wealthy, according to a strategist who advises House Democrats and was briefed on the polling.Mikie Sherrill, a lawyer and former helicopter pilot who has emerged as the most formidable of Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s potential Democratic opponents, quickly seized on the tax plan to brand the incumbent as out of touch.Describing the bill as a \u201cgut punch\u201d to the district, Ms. Sherrill stressed that New Jersey taxpayers would not benefit from the legislation in the same way as people in redder states, where local tax deductions are less valuable.\u201cI don\u2019t think we are going to feel it here in New Jersey as a tax-cut bill,\u201d she said of the House plan. \u201cBeing middle class in New Jersey is a little different from being middle class elsewhere, like Alabama.\u201dThat sense of regional grievance crosses party lines, with both Republicans and Democrats in prosperous coastal areas venting frustration at the possibility that their tax burden may rise as rates fall for corporations and taxpayers in redder states. Mr. Zeldin said that would exacerbate the existing indignity that New Yorkers pay more money in federal taxes than the state gets back from Washington.Representative Peter T. King of New York, a Republican whose district neighbors Mr. Zeldin\u2019s, said suburban voters would punish Republicans if the current bill becomes law. He said lawmakers had appealed to members of the Trump administration who hail from the area, like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, but so far to little avail.\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll strengthen them in other parts of the country, but it\u2019s going to create very real and justifiable political issues in New York and New Jersey,\u201d Mr. King said of Republican candidates. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about restructuring a large part of the economy of the Northeast.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the 2016 presidential election results in Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s district. The district split almost evenly between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, slightly favoring Mr. Trump. It is not the case that Mrs. Clinton won the district.Nick Corasaniti and Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Distaste for Honduran Leaders Who Linger Fuels Distrust in Election", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEGUCIGALPA, Honduras \u2014 There are two versions of President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez of Honduras, who is seeking a second term in a country where the idea of re-election is so toxic that another president was ousted in a coup just for talking about it.That stark difference in perceptions has turned Sunday\u2019s election into a referendum on how much control over the country\u2019s fragile institutions Honduran voters are willing to cede to Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, a conservative.\u201cRe-election means the strengthening of presidential rule and an increase in the concentration of power,\u201d said Victor Meza, a security analyst and former interior minister. The result, he said, \u201ccould unleash an unchecked authoritarianism.\u201dAlthough many Latin American countries now allow re-election, a deep distrust of leaders who maneuver to stay in power persists, a legacy of the region\u2019s history of dictatorship. That suspicion is at the heart of this election campaign, in which the opposition argues that Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s place on the ballot is illegitimate.What put him there was a ruling by the Supreme Court, which lifted the Constitution\u2019s ironclad ban on presidential re-elections in a circuitous ruling two years ago. The five judges who made the decision all owed their positions to Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, and their predecessors had been hurriedly dismissed or moved.The ruling went unopposed by the country\u2019s political and business leaders \u2014 who had a very different attitude in 2009, when they removed the leftist President Manuel Zelaya on the grounds that he was maneuvering to find a way around the re-election ban.The coup, and the widely criticized ruling of the handpicked Supreme Court, were blows to democracy, said Fernando Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, a lawyer who served as a minister in two governments.\u201cThere is no more real dialogue,\u201d he said.Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez is favored to win a second four-year term because the opposition is split, and he just needs to win the plurality of votes, which his party\u2019s base could give him, not a majority.The Libre Party led by Mr. Zelaya, and a smaller party, have formed what they are calling the \u201copposition alliance against the dictatorship,\u201d or the Alianza, to compete in this election, and have put forth the former sportscaster and game-show host Salvador Nasralla as the coalition\u2019s presidential candidate.The third main candidate is Luis Zelaya (not related to the former president), an academic who won the Liberal Party nomination and has broken his party\u2019s loose alliance with the Hern\u00e1ndez presidency to mount a confrontational campaign.Under pressure, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, who has said he did not know about the illegal financing, agreed to allow the formation of a panel of foreign prosecutors to help their Honduran counterparts and to propose anticorruption laws.But efforts at reform have been hampered by Congress, where the National Party has a working majority. Legislators have yet to pass proposals that would encourage suspects in corruption and other criminal cases to cooperate with prosecutors, and they have not rewritten a broad secrecy law that allows the government to withhold documents of state agencies.Instead, Congress passed a penal code that slashes prison sentences for corruption by almost two-thirds in some cases.\u201cIn politics, there are no coincidences,\u201d Mr. Jim\u00e9nez said.Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, 49, has refused to debate any his opponents during the campaign, and his allies have helped squash any discussion of corruption.A new antiterrorism law makes it a crime to march in a protest and opens journalists to the charge of aiding terrorists if they report on a demonstration.\u201cHondurans aren\u2019t allowed to express themselves as they want, and they feel that their votes don\u2019t count,\u201d said Juliette Handal, a prominent business executive who ran for office as a Libre candidate in 2013 but is now an independent. The effect spills beyond politics, she warned.\u201cNo country can have a strong economy if it doesn\u2019t have strong institutions,\u201d Ms. Handal said.Under Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s predecessor, violence spiked so drastically that Honduras became one of the world\u2019s most dangerous countries. Tens of thousands of Hondurans, including many children traveling alone, fled, seeking asylum in the United States.\u201cHonduras is an unconditional and obliging ally of the United States in security,\u201d Mr. Meza, the security analyst, said. \u201cBut it turns out to be uncomfortable,\u201d he added, \u201con the issue of corruption.\u201dThe homicide rate fell 28 percent from its peak in 2012 through 2016 and has continued to drop this year, the result of a combination of actions, including new investigative units, the dismantling of some drug cartels and better policing in high-crime neighborhoods.But Honduras remains one of the most deadly countries in the world, and more than 90 percent of homicides go unpunished.With money from a special tax on financial transactions, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez has built maximum security prisons and set up a military police force. He has also extradited more than a dozen drug traffickers to the United States.A commission set up to purge corruption in the police has dismissed thousands of officers and is replacing the old force with newly trained young recruits.The effort has convinced Norma Ortiz, 52, who runs a stall selling children\u2019s clothes at an outdoor market in Tegucigalpa, the capital. \u201cWe\u2019re happy. He has sent a bunch of the big bosses to el Pozo,\u201d Ms. Ortiz said, referring to one of the new prisons known as \u201cthe Well.\u201dShe used to pay a little over $4 a week in extortion money, but the gangs stopped coming around after the police and soldiers began regular patrols in the market, she said.As part of his anti-crime push, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez has built parks guarded by the military police. It is one of the measures that persuaded Karen Mart\u00ednez, 34, to switch her vote from the Liberal Party and support Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez.\u201cHe has put a bit of an iron fist on the situation of the country,\u201d said Ms. Mart\u00ednez, a saleswoman in a bridal store who had brought her 3- and 6-year-old boys to play in the park at the edge of a rough neighborhood.Luis Cruz, 33, and Fernando Torres, 21, had come to play soccer at the park, but they had no love for Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez. The military police harassed them constantly, they said, taking their money, their cellphones, even their soccer balls.Critics argue that many of Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s social programs are designed simply to buy votes \u2014 with a deliberate blurring between his National Party and the government.In the town of Santa Luc\u00eda, a National Party stronghold outside Tegucigalpa, many voters at a recent rally had received handouts, including wood-fueled stoves for baking bread. A party worker had showed up that morning at the home of Juliana Mart\u00ednez Avila, 51, a widow with six children, with a bag of food staples.Voters waiting for an Alianza rally in Talanga, a farming town outside the capital, also expected help from politicians. Mayeli L\u00f3pez, 25, said that a promise by Mr. Nasralla to cancel highway tolls would help her husband\u2019s small trucking business.Flags were waving as Mr. Nasralla and Mr. Zelaya rolled into the town.\u201cWe hope they keep all their promises,\u201d said Jonathan Urbina, 20, who drives a three-wheeled motor taxi when he can get work. \u201cWith deeds, not just with words.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft to Expand Campus, as Amazon Looks Elsewhere", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetThe project, which Microsoft plans to announce at its annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday, amounts to a major overhaul of the company\u2019s 500-acre campus in Redmond, Wash., the leafy Seattle suburb that it has called home since 1986.Amazon said it received 238 bids from across North America and is whittling down the list to a group of finalists, with a winner to be announced next year.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said the company did not intend for its hometown expansion \u2014 which he described as a multibillion-dollar investment \u2014 as a comment on Amazon. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re out to make a statement about what anyone else is doing or not doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is the right decision for us.\u201dStill, Mr. Smith could not resist a slight dig. \u201cWhen it comes to headquarters, one is enough, we feel,\u201d he said.Today Microsoft\u2019s Redmond campus has most of the trappings found at the sprawling headquarters of tech giants in Silicon Valley \u2014 the soccer fields, manicured lawns and oceans of parking lots. That will not change on its renovated campus, but Microsoft is taking a different approach in other respects.The new buildings will be clustered closer together. They will also be taller \u2014 four stories instead of the two or three that are common now. There will be a new underground parking facility, a 2-acre open plaza that will serve as a central gathering place and new walking and cycling trails.\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to build a somewhat denser campus and create a somewhat more urban feel,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The company\u2019s decision to stay put at its Redmond campus flies in the face of a trend among technology companies to gravitate closer to cities. The abundance of amenities, night life and public transportation in urban areas has led to thriving tech scenes in San Francisco, New York and other cities.\u201cMy gut reaction is, \u2018Wow, they seem kind of out of touch,\u2019\u201d said Dan Bertolet, a researcher at Sightline Institute, a nonprofit in Seattle focused on sustainability. \u201cAll the young people I know who work in the tech industry out there want to be in Seattle. They pooh-pooh places like Redmond.\u201dTech companies are also finding that the talent they are after increasingly wants to live in cities, not suburbs. That has led suburban giants like Google, Facebook and Apple to operate large private bus services to ferry workers to their headquarters. Microsoft\u2019s own bus service has more than 94 buses and over 4,000 daily riders.But those buses also frequently sit in soul-crushing traffic. Possible relief for Microsoft\u2019s commuters will come in the form of light-rail that will connect it to Seattle. A light-rail station on Microsoft\u2019s campus is scheduled to open by 2023.Had Microsoft decided to move to Seattle rather than remain in the suburbs, the company would likely have faced severe criticism from affordability advocates, who are worried about lower income residents getting pushed out of the city.Mr. Bertolet said suburban areas outside Seattle tend to restrict the density of housing so they\u2019re not likely to develop an urban atmosphere without significant change. \u201cMaybe in the long term,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s better to have a regional network of bigger cities, but getting there will be rough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Drives OPEC to Extend Oil Production Cuts", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIENNA \u2014 OPEC and other major oil producers wrapped up a deal on Thursday to extend output cuts through the end of 2018, part of efforts to bolster prices.Despite rising prices, Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil producer and the cartel\u2019s de facto leader, had insisted that extending the cuts, which were set to expire at the end of March, was necessary to further reduce what Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi oil minister, said were still high stockpiles of oil.Mr. Falih, speaking at a news conference with Russia\u2019s energy minister, Alexander Novak, said that he would be \u201cbreathing down the necks\u201d of the 24 countries who are now party to the agreement to ensure that they stuck to their commitments.Mr. Falih also pulled off a surprise by announcing that Libya and Nigeria, OPEC members that had been exempt from the production agreement because of hardship and had boosted output, had promised not to exceed their 2017 production levels next year.Helima Croft, an analyst at the investment bank RBC Capital Markets, gave Mr. Falih high marks. \u201cI think in some respects he exceeded expectations,\u201d she said.\u201cThis is a win for OPEC,\u201d said Abhishek Deshpande, head of oil market strategy at JPMorgan. An extension, he said, \u201cshould help put a floor under prices.\u201dSaudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest exporter of oil and OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, wanted the meeting\u2019s outcome to send a strong signal to the energy markets that the cartel\u2019s efforts to reduce supplies and push up prices would continue.Though the crown prince, 32, was not at the talks in Vienna, his plans for transforming Saudi Arabia were on participants\u2019 minds. In the short term, his ambitions depend on robust oil prices, and the Saudi oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, has spent the past year lobbying OPEC colleagues and other producers like Russia to agree to production cuts and stick to them.The cuts by OPEC members and other producers have amounted to more than 1 percent of global supplies, but they have taken on outsize significance in the markets. Mr. Falih appears to have been acutely aware of the danger that any disappointment might have undone at least some of his work.\u201cWe cannot afford to be complacent,\u201d Mr. Falih said on Wednesday, ahead of a meeting of oil officials to monitor compliance with the agreement. \u201cIn order to continue meeting our shared goals, a good deal more hard work and commitment is essential.\u201dHaving been badly burned in recent years by low prices \u2014 they fell to around $30 a barrel in early 2016 \u2014 most of the group seems inclined to at least verbally commit to going along with Saudi wishes.In a meeting with reporters on Wednesday, the Iraqi oil minister, Jabbar Ali Hussein al-Luiebi, said his country, now OPEC\u2019s second-largest producer, would continue to support the cuts. He added, however, that they were costing Iraq substantial revenue at a time of huge financial need. The country is looking to rebuild after retaking vast stretches of territory from the Islamic State militant group.Mr. Luiebi also nodded to a worry that has been on the minds of other OPEC members: that higher prices may, in the end, be self-defeating if they lead to a drilling boom by shale operators in the United States.He said Iraq was \u201chappy\u201d with the plan, so long as it did not encourage rivals to invest and impact the market. \u201cOne should really be very careful,\u201d he added, suggesting that OPEC may begin to discuss an \u201cexit strategy,\u201d relaxing the cuts without sinking the market.Even the Saudis, who are absorbing a greater share of the cuts, may not want to continue with restraints once the sale of the Saudi Aramco stake is finished. Riyadh has invested more than other OPEC members in developing its oil industry and may try to fully maximize those investments through high production levels.While the Saudis may want a higher price now, \u201cI think their long-term interests are with a greater market share,\u201d said Jim Krane, a fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Calls for Cutting Car Emissions by a Third. Not Enough, Critics Say.", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe proposals by the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, would force automakers to cut vehicle carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent by 2030 compared to 2021 levels, and to achieved half of the cuts by 2025.To the disappointment of environmental groups, the commission declined to set quotas for how many zero-emission electric vehicles carmakers must sell by 2030. Instead, the plan offers financial rewards to carmakers if they exceed certain benchmarks for electric-vehicle production.The emissions targets announced by the European Commission on Wednesday are \u201ca half-step into the future,\u201d Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen said. \u201cThey spared themselves the other half-step because they are afraid of the future.\u201dGerman car brands like Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche that emphasize big luxury cars have a harder time meeting tough carbon dioxide standards than companies like France\u2019s Renault or Italy\u2019s Fiat, which, in relative terms, sell more small cars.The European Commission acknowledged consulting car industry representatives as part of the normal legislative process, but denied abandoning quotas under pressure from the German government or industry lobbyists. Quotas were never under consideration, the commission press office said in a statement on Wednesday.\u201cAny claims that we ever aimed to introduce quotas for electric cars are simply untrue and have no foundation,\u201d the statement said.Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the top commission official responsible for climate action and energy, spoke by telephone on Friday with Matthias Wissmann, president of the German Association of the Auto Industry, a lobbying group, the commission said. Mr. Wissmann is a former German transportation minister with close ties to the German government.\u201cThe phone call took place as part of an inclusive, broader stakeholder engagement by the commission aimed at listening to the views of all interested parties,\u201d the commission press office said in its statement.Mr. Ca\u00f1ete said on Wednesday that the commission opposed quotas for electric vehicles because it did not think it should be choosing which technologies were best. \u201cInstead we let carmakers decide,\u201d he said at a news conference in Brussels.Mr. Wissmann also exchanged emails last month with Martin Selmayr, a top aide to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission\u2019s president. Copies of the emails, viewed by The New York Times, indicate that Mr. Wissmann got some, but not all, of what he sought.As Mr. Wissmann requested, the commission did not impose sanctions on carmakers that fall short of benchmarks for electric-vehicle production. But he failed to prevent the commission from establishing mandatory, interim goals for 2025.Those who support quotas said that setting such quotas would encourage suppliers and other companies to invest in electric-vehicle technology by ensuring that there would be a market.The plan also calls for Europe to spend 800 million euros, or $928 million, to build charging stations for electric vehicles, and \u20ac200 million to develop battery technologies.Volkswagen, which helped provoke the current debate by fraudulently concealing excess diesel emissions for a decade, is now trying to reposition itself as a leader in bringing electric cars to the mass market. The company was only mildly critical of the proposals, saying the European Union should do more to reduce emissions of the 250 million cars already on the road by, for example, promoting the use of synthetic fuels.In a statement, Volkswagen reiterated its goal of introducing 50 all-electric models by 2025 and called the proposed reductions in carbon dioxide emissions \u201cpositive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This became even more evident after the Oct. 1 referendum on independence, with rushed legislative actions to encourage firms to move out of Catalonia, as well as direct pressure on large companies to leave.This damage to Catalan society is part of a longstanding strategy of the Spanish government. It has handed down arbitrary and capricious policy decisions. The Constitutional Court has suspended every one of the initiatives of the Catalan government. Whether the issues involve gender equality, energy or the economy, everything has been cut down at the behest of the Popular Party government in Madrid.We believed that if we voted for independence peacefully, the Spanish government would listen to us.

Beating people up in the name of ideas now seems to be lawful.With the referendum\u2019s passing vote, the Catalan Republic was born, and it is supported by the legitimacy of the ballot boxes.

Today in Catalonia there is a clear dissociation between the democratic will of citizens and the central government, which has set out to take over the people\u2019s institutions and control them despotically.Spain\u2019s government has entered Catalonia with a determination to interfere in the educational curriculum, to control the media, to put our police force at its service, to convert the country into just one more province of a divided Spain that does not tolerate national plurality, to crush any dissidence, however democratic, and to kill any hope of dialogue.We cannot allow this. It is essential to weave solid alliances with all the social and economic actors that want to build a national state truly at the service of its citizens. In spite of the obstacles being placed in our way, we must move forward. We must never give up the vote as a means of validating the republic, and we must prepare future local elections that will be essential to the consolidation of this republic.In the face of this attack we must recompose our forces, persevere and have no doubt that with the civility and peaceful attitude we have always displayed, we will continue to advance as far as we decide to go.The courage this country has shown is so enlightening and so strong that sooner or later it will result in the consolidation of the full, truly just and democratic Republic of Catalonia.An earlier version of a biographical note with this essay included outdated information.

President Trump\u2019s vow to withdraw from the Paris agreement by 2020 was a troubling abdication of that leadership, and it threatened to send a dangerously wrong message: that we are abandoning the pledge we made in Paris to reduce emissions at least 26 percent by 2025.President Trump\u2019s action has had the effect of galvanizing these groups \u2014 and many have taken bold actions in recent months.California just extended its landmark cap-and-trade emissions program through 2030, and has adopted incentives that will help put 1.5 million electric and other zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2025. Chicago has proposed an energy rating system for its large buildings to drive down emissions substantially, with $70 million in projected annual savings on utility bills. Companies in a wide variety of industries \u2014 from Bloomberg to Wal-Mart \u2014 have pledged to procure 100 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2025 or sooner. And broader trends, including falling renewable energy costs and the retirement of additional coal-fired power plants, continue to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and accelerate the decarbonization of the American economy.Even Oklahoma and Texas \u2014 the home states of Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Rick Perry, the energy secretary, who both oppose the climate accord \u2014 are national leaders in wind power production. Coal is a fading energy source in both states.In the current political climate, however, there is a risk that nonfederal actions will go unrecognized by the global community. To ensure the world sees the continued commitment of the United States to tackling climate change, and the extent to which local governments and businesses are driving progress, we have introduced an initiative called America\u2019s Pledge, which will document the progress we are making \u2014 and the bolder actions we must still take \u2014 to meet our Paris commitments.Together, these actions will strengthen the economy and improve public health, while also helping the United States move faster toward its Paris commitment. Over the next year, we will aggregate and quantify these actions and continue pushing for new efforts to speed up decarbonization.The Paris agreement succeeded where previous attempts failed because it solicited nationally determined pledges from nations based on local actions already taking place. For the United States to reach its commitment, much more needs to be done. But the world should know: We are not waiting for Washington.Advertisement"}

Via an App, He Attended His Wedding.", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Neediest Cases FundFrom an empty hallway at one of his jobs in Manhattan, Abdulaziz Marwan Hussin Mohammed watched his own wedding celebration through a fuzzy WhatsApp connection.His family called from Khartoum, Sudan, so he could see his fianc\u00e9e, Hind Sirelkhatim Hamid Mukhtar, receive their marriage license.Relatives passed the phone around the banquet hall, congratulating him via the messaging app. Guests ate fried chicken and falafel. \u201cAnd I guess they had cake, but I didn\u2019t see it,\u201d Mr. Mohammed, 32, added recently with a laugh.Missing the ceremony in August was yet another in a series of challenges for the long-distance couple, who had struck up a romance after he moved to New York in 2014.They met in Khartoum while they both worked at a heavy equipment company. Mr. Mohammed, who is soft-spoken and describes himself as shy, was fixing a computer four years ago when Ms. Mukhtar, an accountant, introduced herself. She shook his hand with the warmth and confidence of friend, he said. \u201cShe\u2019s really outgoing,\u201d he added. \u201cThe opposite of me.\u201dMr. Mohammed did not want to start a relationship in Sudan only to leave soon after, he said, so he kept his love for Ms. Mukhtar a secret. He had long dreamed of moving to New York, thanks to movies and descriptions by friends. For him, the city represented an escape from problems at home.Mr. Mohammed was born in Saudi Arabia after his father, Marwan Hussin Mohammed Jabr, moved the family from Sudan to the port city of Jeddah to take a job at an import-export company. Although Mr. Mohammed and most of his five siblings were born in Saudi Arabia and practice Islam, as ethnic Sudanese, they were treated as second-class citizens, he said. When he was 10, his eldest brother, who was born in Sudan, returned there for college, and most of the family, discouraged by racial tensions, followed.In his early 20s, discouraged by the lack of opportunities in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Mohammed twice entered the visa lottery but was not selected. After his third application in 2012, he stared in disbelief at his name on the screen when he saw he was among the 50,000 successful candidates.\u201cI was like, Is this legit?\u201d he recalled. \u201cI thought, This is my escape; I\u2019m leaving Saudi Arabia.\u201dBut this was not a golden ticket into the United States. Mr. Mohammed still had to apply for a visa in Sudan, where he lived and worked while his paperwork was being processed. When he received an interview date, he told Ms. Mukhtar, a co-worker who had become a close friend, about his plans. They agreed to stay in touch.Mr. Mohammed had been excited for his future in New York, he said, but he worried that he was leaving behind the woman who might be his future wife. After he settled in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn in late 2014, he made it a priority to keep in contact with Ms. Mukhtar, despite the seven-hour time difference. Unable to hold in his feelings any longer, Mr. Mohammed soon broached the subject. \u201cAnd she said that she already knew,\u201d he recalled. Then the couple\u2019s romance began.After about a year and a half, they began talking about marriage. The official proposal came several months later, in September 2016, when, keeping with Sudanese tradition, Mr. Mohammed had his father ask Ms. Mukhtar\u2019s family for permission. At the wedding in August, following custom, his father and her uncle signed the marriage license.Now, as they wait to be reunited, the couple continue to talk regularly. \u201cEven four times a day is not enough,\u201d Mr. Mohammed said.Mr. Mohammed said he appreciated New York\u2019s many opportunities. In December, he earned several technology certifications that are not offered in Sudan, he said. But life in the city has been difficult financially. He works three jobs, as an on-call field computer technician at an information technology company and as a part-time instructor\u2019s assistant and lab technician at Borough of Manhattan Community College, where he is studying computer networking part-time. He makes about $25,000 a year.Mr. Mohammed returned to Sudan this month, seeing his wife in person for the first time since 2014. They will not see each other again until Ms. Mukhtar\u2019s visa application is processed. They hope to live together in the United States within the year, he said. In the meantime, he plans to get additional certifications in the networking field and then support Ms. Mukhtar, 30, who would like to earn a master\u2019s degree in accounting.So far, Mr. Mohammed has visited just two states, New York and Virginia. He plans to see all 50, he said, but is waiting on the other 48 until his wife arrives.\u201cI\u2019ll do those with her,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m purposefully withholding all the entertainment in my life until she comes. We\u2019ll see them together.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a man who received Neediest Cases funds. He is Abdulaziz Marwan Hussin Mohammed, not Andulaziz.

{"Headline": "Poised for West Coast Dominance, Democrats Eye Grand Agenda", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAMMAMISH, Wash. \u2014 It is the stuff of liberal fantasies: a vast, defiant territory, sweeping along the country\u2019s Pacific coastline, governed by Democrats and resisting President Trump at every turn.Sharon Nelson, the Democratic leader in the Washington State Senate, conveyed the party\u2019s grand aspirations in an almost Trump-like phrase: \u201cA blue wall,\u201d Ms. Nelson enthused, \u201cfrom the Canadian border to the Mexican border.\u201dLeading in the polls and anticipating victory, Democrats have sketched an aggressive agenda on issues where strong consensus appears to exist in the party, including new laws on gun control, contraception and environmental regulation. Ms. Nelson said she had met with the speaker of the Oregon Statehouse about enacting policy across state lines. The three states\u2019 Democratic governors have spoken regularly about policy collaboration, and over the summer began coordinated talks on climate change with foreign heads of state.\u201cWe intend to make a full-scale effort in the next session of the Legislature if we win,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a bell in the night, showing hope for the country, rejecting the Trump agenda of denying climate science.\u201d\u201cThe more we can have uniformity in a carbon pricing system or regulatory system, the better,\u201d he said.Both parties see Democrats as favored to win the district, which voted heavily for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Republicans held the area\u2019s State Senate seat largely because of the personal popularity of an incumbent lawmaker, Andy Hill, who died of lung cancer last fall.Despite their dominance at the federal level and in most state capitals, West Coast Republicans have been driven to the point of extinction as the party\u2019s standing has plummeted in prosperous cities and suburbs, from San Diego to Seattle. Their candidate in the State Senate race, Jinyoung Lee Englund, a polished former political operative, has strained to set herself apart from the national party, declaring that she did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 and pleading with voters to embrace divided government in Olympia.Ms. Englund, 33, has campaigned explicitly against the \u201cblue wall\u201d scenario, warning that voters should not let Washington \u201cgo the way of California\u201d and other one-party states. She expressed deep skepticism of Mr. Inslee\u2019s climate proposals and suggested Democrats were mainly focused on trying to raise general revenue by another name. Republican groups have aired commercials saying that \u201cSeattle liberals\u201d could wreak havoc on the state\u2019s finances if Democrats are allowed to govern unchecked.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go the way of Oregon,\u201d Ms. Englund said in an interview. \u201cWashingtonians are more independent.\u201dMs. Englund rebuked Democrats for what she characterized as using the state government as a partisan bludgeon. \u201cI think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThe role of a state senator is not to go and lambaste what\u2019s happening nationally.\u201dMs. Dhingra, 43, a gregarious career prosecutor, has pledged support for an array of Democratic wish-list policies \u2014 though in a nod to the district\u2019s moderate history, her campaign literature promises \u201cindependent leadership.\u201d She has endorsed a carbon tax and applauded the state\u2019s insistent litigation against the White House. Ms. Dhingra said in an interview that state government should take comprehensive action to check \u201cwhat\u2019s coming out of Washington, D.C.\u201d\u201cFrankly, I think all states are going to have to do that,\u201d Ms. Dhingra said. \u201cWe have to make sure immigrants feel safe. We have to make sure women\u2019s health care is protected.\u201dRepublican leaders in the state concede the national backdrop has made a tough race even harder. Rob McKenna, a former state attorney general who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Inslee in 2012, said an upset is possible but called the \u201cTrump factor\u201d a drag on Ms. Englund.Mr. McKenna cautioned that even a Democratic victory should not be overinterpreted as a political turning point. A setback for Republicans, he said, would not change the fundamental character of the state, which he described as more politically competitive and fiscally conservative than its coastal neighbors.\u201cThis is a state that is still, more or less, 50-50,\u201d Mr. McKenna said, predicting of Democrats: \u201cThey\u2019ll have difficulties, because they\u2019ll be reluctant to risk their majorities in the House and the Senate.\u201dOther local leaders are less sure, holding up the Seattle area as an illustrative example of an upwardly mobile metropolitan area shifting to the left. If Republicans have staked their message, in large part, on suburban distrust of the big city, the region is increasingly knitted together by a thriving tech economy at companies like Amazon and Microsoft, and an expanding rapid transit rail network that is tying people closer to Seattle.\u201cThe comical attempts to demonize Seattle in the 45th District race, I think, will be shown to have been a poor strategy,\u201d Mr. Constantine said.The area\u2019s shifting identity has been on vivid display in this election: As Ms. Dhingra went door to door on Wednesday in Duvall, a growing outer suburb built across rolling farmlands, some voters sounded eager to repudiate Republicans. Patty Andrus, a retired paraprofessional in the field of special education, described Ms. Dhingra\u2019s campaign as a corrective to Mr. Trump\u2019s election.With a Democratic takeover in Washington State, she said, \u201cI would stand up taller.\u201dEven some Republican-leaning voters who back Ms. Englund say they are uneasy about Mr. Trump. \u201cShe seems sensible and levelheaded,\u201d Ed Whitehead, the retired owner of a printing company, said of Ms. Englund after she stopped at his door in Sammamish.Mr. Whitehead, who said he voted for Mr. Trump, said these days he is \u201cnot so sure\u201d about the president.Ms. Dhingra suggested that the session might become mainly a chance for Democrats to prove themselves responsible, rather than as a lunge toward California-like status. The Democratic caucus, she noted, is not homogeneous: \u201cYou have rural-area Democrats who have different priorities.\u201dMr. Inslee, too, said Democrats should temper their expectations, even as he made plain his excitement about governing with a freer hand.\u201cThere\u2019s diversity of views in all caucuses, and so nothing\u2019s guaranteed in life,\u201d Mr. Inslee said. \u201cBut what this does is, it takes the shackles off the doors.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the name of a city in Washington where Manka Dhingra canvassed.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade Approach Diverges Sharply from Free Trade Republicans", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s isolationist approach to trade is rattling what little uneasy peace remains within the Republican Party as the White House pursues policies at odds with longstanding conservative orthodoxy about the benefits of free and open markets.Republicans have long championed free trade, believing that by allowing markets to operate unhindered, nations can boost domestic industries, lift their wages and improve living standards. That view is not shared by Mr. Trump, who has taken a much more critical approach to trade, sowing concern among many Republicans and business groups that the United States will wind up on the losing end of an integrated global economy.The divergence was on display last week, with Mr. Trump proclaiming during a trip to Asia that the United States will no longer enter into the type of multination trade agreements that America has long led the world in creating.\u201cI will make bilateral trade agreements with any Indo-Pacific nation that wants to be our partner and that will abide by the principles of fair and reciprocal trade,\u201d the president said in Vietnam on Nov. 10. \u201cWhat we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible.\u201dIn a speech at the White House on Wednesday, the president recounted the warning he had given to other leaders as he traveled across Asia about exploiting America\u2019s open trading system for their economic gain. He proclaimed that his tougher approach to trade had begun to take effect, and that nations around the world have renewed respect for the United States.\u201cThe days of the United States being taken advantage of are over,\u201d Mr. Trump said.But despite the president\u2019s declarations of progress and his promises to make one-on-one deals, he appeared to have returned from the trip empty-handed, without any new trade deals in process. At the same time, several of the nations he visited announced they were moving forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an 11-country trade deal that had support from Republicans but which Mr. Trump jettisoned during his first days in office.Republicans and business groups are now warily eyeing talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which resume again this week against the backdrop of Mr. Trump\u2019s get-tough talk. Mr. Trump has already repeatedly threatened to withdraw from Nafta if Canada and Mexico don\u2019t accede to the United States\u2019 demands. The White House could soon be forced to decide whether to accept minor changes to the accord in a face-saving gesture or withdraw entirely, since neither Canada nor Mexico shows signs of bending.Canadian and Mexican negotiators believe that renegotiating the pact to more heavily favor the United States would cost them politically at home \u2014 and that, even if they agreed to Mr. Trump\u2019s demands, the United States Congress would not approve them.The fissures over trade are a product of a surge in populism on both the political right and left.Growing anxieties about the unforeseen costs of globalization, the overhang of the financial crisis and the stagnation of the middle class have deeply damaged voters\u2019 faith in the ability of free markets to deliver prosperity \u2014 and fractured the Republican Party in the process. Conservative populism is in ascendance, while free market Republicans have been left increasingly marginalized.In a recent interview with The New York Times, Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House strategist who has declared war on the Republican establishment, mocked the party\u2019s views on trade.\u201cYeah, we\u2019re free traders, yeah, they passed a free trade deal,\u201d Mr. Bannon said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even questioned, O.K.? It was Holy Writ, never questioned. And in that, I said, \u2018No, this is what\u2019s destroyed the country.\u2019\u201dWhile free trade has been broadly beneficial to the United States, politicians and business leaders in past decades oversold its potential to benefit all, said Stefan Selig, a former trade official in the Obama administration.The benefit to the average American of being able to buy cheaper products was no match for the concentrated damage that global trade \u2014 in addition to forces like automation \u2014 has wrought in some American communities. Workers have suffered job losses across the United States as mills, factories and manufacturing plants either shuttered their doors completely or moved production overseas.\u201cThat is not a political cocktail that is a good one, especially in primary seasons,\u201d said Mr. Selig.Business leaders argue there is an ideological inconsistency between the administration\u2019s plans to cut and simplify taxes and regulation \u2014 and its measure on trade, which essentially would increase both.Matt Blunt, the former Republican governor of Missouri and the president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford, General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler, said the administration\u2019s proposal for the auto industry under Nafta would encourage more companies to pay a tariff to import their goods, essentially creating a new tax on the industry.Mr. Blunt said the proposals \u201cwould seem to be counterproductive to the goals and aspirations of the Trump administration, which has talked about how they can help industry be competitive through regulatory reform and hopefully a tax cut, not a massive tax increase.\u201dLance Fritz, the president and C.E.O. of Union Pacific Railroad, said pulling out of Nafta would harm trade, which would in turn weigh on his business. \u201cTariffs are taxes and empirically and theoretically, the more you tax something, the less you get of it,\u201d he said.Some Republicans, including those from farming and border-states, have protested the president\u2019s threats to withdraw from Nafta, arguing its loss would deeply harm their constituents.But the response from other quarters \u2014 including congressional leadership \u2014 has been surprisingly muted, given how deeply the president\u2019s actions contradict the Republican Party\u2019s longstanding faith in freer trade.\u201cIt\u2019s just one more item to oppose the White House on and a lot of people are not willing to do that,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. Mr. Flake, an outspoken critic of the president, said that Republicans had always \u201ccarried the water\u201d in fighting the sometimes politically unpopular fight for freer trade.\u201cI\u2019m really worried about where we are headed,\u201d Mr. Flake said.Trade advisers say congressional leaders are pressing the United States trade representative, who handles the negotiations, behind the scenes. But most have not been willing to create an open rift with the president on trade that could put at risk their current efforts of reforming taxes, said Phil Levy, a senior economist for trade during the Bush administration.\u201cThere is little enthusiasm among congressional Republicans for open conflict, but that doesn\u2019t make the tensions go away,\u201d Mr. Levy said.Gardiner Harris contributed to this report.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Nothing Against You\u2019: For a Black Man Covering Race, the Story Is Never Far From Home", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVALLEJO, Calif. \u2014 The question, I thought, was harmless enough.\u201cTell me how being in such a diverse community has influenced you in your life,\u201d I asked Fred Hatfield as we sat at the counter of a diner here.Most of the answers I got were the ones you might expect. Diversity introduced residents to new foods, for instance; it allowed them to look past the stereotypes they see on television and get to know people as they are.But I got a dimmer view from Mr. Hatfield. He said that most of the \u201cgangbangers\u201d in Vallejo were people of color, and he thought that I, a black man, was up to no good when he first saw me.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of negativity involved with it, I\u2019ll tell you right now,\u201d Mr. Hatfield said of Vallejo\u2019s diversity as he tucked into a $7.59 breakfast special of eggs over easy, toast, bacon and potatoes with chives.Mr. Hatfield\u2019s disparaging remarks about minorities and his quickness to stereotype me underscored a truth about covering race in America as a black man: The story is never far from home. That usually means white people are extra polite with me when giving their thoughts about black people, while black people tend toward frankness when we discuss race.Mr. Hatfield, to be clear, was very much an exception in Vallejo in terms of his blunt bias. But to an extreme degree, he represented a surprising paradox I found here. Diversity, it seemed, makes people feel comfortable using stereotypes and expressing biases. Making fun of how Asians speak? It\u2019s no problem, the thinking goes, because I have Asian friends.Mr. Hatfield explained that when the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, once the beating heart of Vallejo\u2019s economy, closed in the mid-1990s, \u201cthey encouraged Section 8 housing, and you know what that brings. And not the color of your skin; it just brings the type of people that take advantage of the situation and they deal drugs and they prostitute, that sort of thing.\u201dHe described Vallejo as having once been \u201ca hard-working, redneck kind of a blue-collar town,\u201d and he reiterated that race did not factor into his perceptions of the city. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I grew up in this town and I have a lot of friends that are all different nationalities. But bad is bad.\u201d\u201cAre the bad people usually a certain race?\u201d I asked.\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d he said. \u201cMostly, what makes the trouble is the gangbangers, and in this town you got blacks, you got Mexicans and you got Asians. You got all three of them. You look around, you see the gang tags. And you\u2019re a pretty hip cat, you know what\u2019s up. And those are the people that cause the problems generally \u2014 in every community, not just here.\u201dAs I pressed him further, Mr. Hatfield said he did believe most of the troublemakers in Vallejo were people of color, but he again wanted me to know that he was not a racist.\u201cSome of my oldest and dearest friends are black guys,\u201d he insisted.Still, he said later that growing up around a lot of nonwhite people here \u201cgave me a negative attitude toward certain individuals and certain racial groups.\u201dI found that most people in Vallejo interacted quite comfortably across racial lines and were accepting of one another, more so than in much of the rest of the United States. Several black people told me, for instance, that they did not feel profiled anywhere they went in town, something I certainly do not hear in most other parts of the country to which I travel.Yet some residents here openly throw around negative stereotypes of people of different races because their social circles include people of all races. They say this means that their sentiments do not come from a hateful place. Even though I am black and have dreadlocks, residents here did not shy away from honestly discussing with me racial issues that many people around the country might be uncomfortable addressing.When I was talking with a white woman one night, for instance, she caught herself before saying C.P.T., or colored people time. African-Americans sometimes use the term to joke that they lack punctuality. The woman said that her black friends use the term with her.Mr. Hatfield, however, had no problem telling me about his initial impression of me the morning we met. I had been inside the diner before it opened, talking to the owner, who is from Korea and has very diverse employees and customers.\u201cWhen I looked in here and the lights were off, I\u2019m going to tell you honestly, I saw a black man standing at the counter,\u201d Mr. Hatfield said. \u201cI, right away, thought something was wrong. Just because \u2014 nothing against you \u2014 the business isn\u2019t open yet, you got a black man standing at the counter.\u201dAgain, he hedged, chalking up his feelings not to race, but to a general pessimism about life. His wife of 20 years left him, taking their million-dollar house on a hill, he said. Wearing a red T-shirt, white pants and a black cap splotched with paint, he said he made a meager living as a painter, had no retirement savings and owed the government a lot of money. But, he proudly declared, he has never relied on public assistance.\u201cI\u2019m not going to say, \u2018Oh, I want government money,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI ain\u2019t taking it. I\u2019ve never been on unemployment. Ever.\u201dI thanked Mr. Hatfield for his time and honesty. Then, as I turned to walk away, he had a question for me.\u201cHey,\u201d he asked, \u201ccan you buy my meal for me?\u201dFollow John Eligon on Twitter @jeligonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Warn of Budget Crunch Under Republican Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Since getting crushed by the recession a decade ago, the state of Oregon has been on an economic upswing. The jobless rate has dipped below 4 percent from a high of 12 percent in 2009, home values are up and people are flocking to the state.But state officials worry that all the economic progress is about to be undercut by the $1.5 trillion Republican tax plan sailing through Congress. While lawmakers say the plan will boost growth and strengthen the economy, Oregon officials say the bill could have the opposite effect by making the state a less affordable place to live and putting a squeeze on state and local budgets.\u201cWhat I am concerned about is that this will impede our forward momentum,\u201d Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said in an interview. \u201cThis tax plan will basically burst the balloon that\u2019s happening here.\u201dOregon is not alone in its concerns. State and local officials in other high-tax, largely blue states like New York, New Jersey and California are warning the tax plan will strain budgets, shake real estate markets and prompt residents to flee expensive coastal states for places with lower taxes.Of primary concern is the Senate\u2019s plan to repeal the state and local tax deduction, which currently allows people who itemize their tax returns to deduct state and local income, sales and property taxes paid. The tax break is claimed by people across the nation, but is more heavily utilized in higher-tax states like Oregon, California, New Jersey and New York. Eliminating the deduction has long been a goal of many Republican lawmakers, who view the tax break as a subsidy that poorer red states provide to richer blue ones that spend heavily on government services.A report this month from Fitch, the credit rating firm, warned that repealing the state and local tax deduction would hit residents especially hard in states such as California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. That could put pressure on state governments to reduce taxes \u2014 an uncomfortable proposition for states that are just recovering from the deep fiscal strain they faced during and after the recession.\u201cMost states are not in a position to lower taxes in response to the federal tax increase due to tepid revenue growth and ongoing spending pressures,\u201d analysts at Fitch said.Ms. Brown, a Democrat, said repealing the deduction will put pressure on state officials to reduce taxes at a time when Oregon is already fiscally stretched in providing education, law enforcement and other services to its residents.\u201cWe are already struggling to pay for basic services,\u201d said Ms. Brown, who acknowledges that her team has not been able to fully analyze the scope of the legislation because it has been moving and changing so rapidly. \u201cFor Congress to move so quickly on a ginormous tax policy like this that has extremely far-reaching impact is just crazy.\u201dThe full repeal of the deduction, often referred to by its acronym, SALT, is not a foregone conclusion. Senate Republicans want to eliminate it completely, saving about $1.3 trillion over a decade, while House Republicans have agreed to maintain a deduction for up to $10,000 in property taxes. The two plans ultimately must be aligned before legislation can be passed and sent to President Trump\u2019s desk for signing.With a Trump administration that is filled with wealthy New Yorkers, the White House is keenly aware of these concerns, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has expressed openness to compromise on the issue. Noting that he has lived in both California and New York, which would be among the hardest hit by a repeal, Mr. Mnuchin has said he is sensitive to the broader impact on the nation of policies that might stunt the growth of state economies.Many leaders in New York hope that the members of the Trump administration who hail from the state will intervene. Some have even appealed to Mr. Trump\u2019s sense of self-interest, warning that getting rid of the deductibility of local taxes could be a big drag on the value of the president\u2019s condominium business in Manhattan if people can no longer afford to live in them.Thomas DiNapoli, New York State\u2019s comptroller, said that if the state and local deduction was completely eliminated, New York would come under pressure to make property or other taxes deductible at the state level. Another possible consequence is that people will just pick up and leave the state, eroding the tax base through attrition as they seek lower tax jurisdictions.\u201cIf you lose that deductibility, I worry about more middle class families leaving,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said. \u201dIf we lose the middle class and end up as a state of both ends, with those who can most afford to stay here and those who can\u2019t afford to move because they don\u2019t have the resources, that\u2019s not a very positive future.\u201dHe added: \u201cBut people may have to pick up and move somewhere else.\u201dBelt tightening at the state level may also trickle down to cities and towns.In New Jersey, state funding has been critical to assisting Atlantic City in its revival efforts after several casinos closed and its economy cratered three years ago. However, lawmakers in the state said last week that the incoming Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, would likely have to rethink the tax increase on the wealthy he has been considering if such taxes are no longer deductible on federal taxes.As they have in other states that would be punished by the repeal of the deduction, even Republicans in New Jersey are urging the House and Senate to think twice about the ramifications of repealing the state and local tax deduction.Mayor Don Guardian of Atlantic City, a Republican whose term concludes at the end of the year, said that repealing the deduction would primarily hurt middle class homeowners across the state who currently itemize their tax returns and benefit from writing off those taxes. He warned that such a move would deal a blow to the resort\u2019s comeback hopes that have been buoyed by the impending opening of a new casino and the arrival of Stockton University\u2019s new campus by the Boardwalk.\u201cAtlantic City has hit the bottom and is coming back up,\u201d Mr. Guardian said, expressing regret that federal tax policies pursued by his own party could derail that progress by forcing residents to essentially be taxed twice. \u201cEvery day is a new crisis, and this is certainly not good.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Ford Turn Itself Into a Tech Company?", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "Mcity, as the facility is known, was built by the University of Michigan as a testing ground for automakers, including Ford, which has been experimenting with self-driving cars here for about two years. I parked my rental and climbed into the back of a white Ford Fusion with four spinning Lidar sensors on the roof, each roughly the size of a water glass, and a rack of high-performance computers in the trunk. Next to me sat Randy Visintainer, Ford\u2019s director of autonomous vehicle development. Jakob Hoellerbauer, a young Ford engineer, took the driver\u2019s seat. Wayne Williams, a Ford research scientist, sat beside him in the passenger seat typing on a laptop. We put on our seatbelts, and Hoellerbauer hit the ignition and pulled into the road. A beep came from the dashboard, indicating that the car was ready to engage self-driving mode. Hoellerbauer pushed a button on the steering wheel and took his hands away.\u201cWe are now autonomous,\u201d Williams announced.The car glided along Main Street to a four-way stop, waited for another car (driven by a researcher) to clear the intersection, then made a gentle right turn. Autonomous cars are programmed to drive conservatively, and any time our Fusion sensed an approaching object \u2014 like a Ford employee, role-playing an oblivious pedestrian \u2014 it slowed down until it was sure the path was clear, then proceeded cautiously. It felt like being chauffeured by an elderly ghost.Two minutes into the drive, the car pulled around a traffic circle and up to a blinking red light at an empty intersection. It stopped. A few seconds passed. Perhaps, I thought, it was just being characteristically risk-averse. Then a few more seconds passed, and the engineers started to look nervous. Williams squinted at his laptop.\u201cSo right now, we\u2019re not sure if the intersection is clear, so we\u2019re being very cautious,\u201d Williams said, speaking for the car. \u201cIt\u2019s expecting ...\u201d He trailed off and turned to Hoellerbauer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just overtake it?\u201d Hoellerbauer grabbed the wheel and tapped the gas pedal, overriding the self-driving system and manually steering us through the intersection.\u201cWe didn\u2019t see that happen this morning,\u201d Williams explained, by way of an apology. We took another lap around Mcity, and when we reached the intersection again, the car did the exact same thing.Self-driving cars raise the specter of horrific malfunctions \u2014 a code glitch that sends a car careering off a cliff, a remote hack that disables the brakes \u2014 but perfectly innocuous problems like the one we experienced will be far more common, and no less an impediment to road-readiness. There are dozens of autonomous vehicles being tested all over the world \u2014 43 companies are testing 295 different self-driving vehicles in California alone \u2014 and not one of them has a clean record. A self-driving Uber vehicle zoomed through a red light in San Francisco last year. The sensors on cars used by Waymo, the self-driving-car division of Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent, have struggled in heavy rain and snow. I\u2019ve had half a dozen self-driving-car experiences in my life, including a white-knuckle trip down Manhattan\u2019s West Side Highway in a Tesla Model X whose owner had set it to \u201cautopilot\u201d mode, and I wouldn\u2019t describe any of them as relaxing.How quickly these rides will improve depends on whom you ask. Silicon Valley futurists, in typically sanguine fashion, predict that we are months, not years, away from a Cambrian explosion of autonomous cars. Waymo has a pilot program for its self-driving vehicles already underway in Arizona and says it\u2019s \u201creally close\u201d to being fully operational. Lyft, which has partnered with a start-up called Drive.ai, is aiming to have a fleet of self-driving cars operating in the Bay Area by the end of the year. And Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, which has offered semiautonomous features since 2015, has suggested that its cars could be fully autonomous as soon as 2019.But that\u2019s California, where optimism is the coin of the realm. In Detroit, the timeline looks slower and more incremental. Ford, in particular, believes that the first generation of driverless cars will be limited, capable of traveling only in commercial fleets inside carefully plotted urban areas. Other cars will simply get smarter without being autonomous, with features like collision prevention and self-parking becoming more common. Self-driving technology will eventually be more sophisticated and will one day be capable of full door-to-door autonomy in every possible area and condition, but as Ford sees it, that\u2019s not going to happen overnight, or even very soon.Despite its pragmatic restraint, Ford has invested hundreds of millions in self-driving cars and is making surprising progress. In a report earlier this year, Navigant Research placed Ford at the top of its leader board, ahead of tech companies like Waymo and Uber as well as auto rivals like GM and Toyota, based on Ford\u2019s advanced manufacturing capabilities coupled with its strides in software development. The report generated headlines like, \u201cDetroit Is Kicking Silicon Valley\u2019s Ass in the Race to Build Self-Driving Cars,\u201d and delivered a morale boost to Ford, which showed up late but finally felt as if it had a chance.Ford\u2019s big, blinking target is 2021 \u2014 the year it hopes to release a vehicle that meets the Society of Automotive Engineers International\u2019s definition of Level 4 autonomy (no human operator required in the area and conditions it\u2019s programmed for). It\u2019s a tough deadline for a company whose culture might be the exact opposite of Silicon Valley\u2019s, where companies release half-finished \u201cminimum viable products\u201d and abide by maxims like \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d Before Ford \u2014 or any conventional automaker \u2014 produces anything, each part has to pass a grueling battery of tests and certifications. There is a reason \u201cautomotive grade\u201d has become a synonym for \u201creliable.\u201d \u201cOur vehicles have to be a trusted product,\u201d Chris Brewer, Ford\u2019s chief engineer for autonomous vehicles, told me. \u201cThat is a little more important than \u2018Did my phone freeze or not?\u2019\u2009\u201dAmericans are wary of driverless cars \u2014 56 percent, according to the Pew Research Center, would prefer not to ride in one \u2014 and when I talked to Brewer, it occurred to me that some part of that hesitation might stem from who we assume will be producing them: Silicon Valley tech giants, the same stateless behemoths that have spent the last few decades barging into old-line industries like the Kool-Aid Man, destroying working-class jobs and leaving behind cold, modern efficiency. But maybe these skeptics could be persuaded to trust Detroit. After all, Brewer is right \u2014 self-driving cars aren\u2019t smartphones. They\u2019re two-ton projectiles that take your parents to the grocery store and your kids to soccer practice, that will need to make billions of computational decisions per second while moving at 65 miles per hour, that contain within them the power to extinguish human life. You kind of want them to take a while.Leading Ford into this weird new era is Jim Hackett, who was named chief executive in May. Hackett, 62, is an oddity by Detroit standards. A design-minded aesthete in an industry dominated by gearheads and number crunchers, he spent two decades running Steelcase, a Michigan-based office-furniture company whose designers are often credited with \u2014 or blamed for \u2014 popularizing the open-plan office trend.At a conference several years ago, Hackett struck up a conversation with Ford\u2019s executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., who goes by Bill. He is the great-grandson of Henry Ford, and another auto-world misfit \u2014 an outspoken environmentalist who once ruffled feathers at Ford by speaking at a Greenpeace event. The two bonded over their shared vision of \u201csmart mobility,\u201d a fuzzy term, more common among urbanists than businesspeople, for creating a sort of harmony among land use, technology and transportation of all forms. Hackett joined Ford\u2019s board of directors in 2013. In 2016, Bill Ford persuaded Hackett to lead Ford\u2019s newly created smart-mobility unit, and about a year later, he tapped him to run the entire company.Hackett\u2019s jockish C.V. \u2014 he played football at Michigan and briefly ran the school\u2019s athletic department \u2014 masks his high-minded streak, which can make talking to him feel like taking a college philosophy seminar after a few bong rips. In the early 2000s, he began traveling to the Santa Fe Institute, a research group started by prominent scientists who wanted to study \u201ccomplex adaptive systems\u201d \u2014 a branch of theoretical physics that imagines the world as a series of complicated networks that are governed by universal laws and patterns, the same way biology is guided by Darwinian evolution. The rules that explained how anthills formed, they believed, might also explain urbanization trends in Southeast Asia or predict economic cycles. It was a formative experience for Hackett, who began to believe that businesses were governed by universal laws, too.Hackett also became obsessed with \u201cdesign thinking,\u201d a new-agey management philosophy that has become trendy in recent years. Adherents believe that instead of optimizing for profit, organizations should put human emotion at the center of every strategy decision and begin by empathizing with their customers. \u201cNo technology ever evolves without the human interpreting and altering it,\u201d Hackett says. \u201cEvery new technology, the science and the engineering of it, has to give way to human understanding and use.\u201dHackett is only six months into the chief-executive job, but his mannerisms have already entered Ford\u2019s bloodstream. I arrived in Dearborn expecting to talk about drivetrains and crankshafts, but in a series of interviews with nearly a dozen executives, barely anyone mentioned cars or trucks at all. Instead, I heard the Ford Motor Company described as a \u201cmobility solutions provider\u201d that engages in \u201cmultimodal journey planning.\u201d People spoke about \u201cwhiteboarding\u201d and \u201cblue-skying\u201d big ideas. I watched a video that described Ford\u2019s efforts to build a \u201cholistic, organic, interconnected system powered by a transportation operating system.\u201dIt is bizarre to watch an all-American manufacturing company get brain-snatched like this. Even the company\u2019s new internal mission statement bears Hackett\u2019s woolly imprint: \u201cTo become the world\u2019s most trusted mobility company by designing smart vehicles for a smart world.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly \u201cBuilt Ford Tough.\u201d But it\u2019s very much in keeping with Hackett\u2019s worldview, in which everything exists in connection with everything else, and changing one piece of a system necessarily changes the whole. A car learns to drive itself, and a city\u2019s transportation grid shifts around it.This kind of big-picture futurism is necessary in Detroit today, where automakers are frantically reinventing themselves to stay ahead of what they fear might be coming. The average personal vehicle is driven less than an hour per day. But self-driving cars can, in theory, pick up and drop off passengers all day, which significantly reduces the number of cars a community needs. (Researchers at the University of Michigan estimate that autonomous vehicles could cause car ownership to drop by as much as 43 percent. Lyft, which has a horse in the race, cites research estimating that as many as 80 percent of cars could eventually be eliminated.) And because much of the value of self-driving cars lies in the software that runs them, companies that make only hardware \u2014 known in the business as \u201coriginal equipment manufacturers,\u201d or O.E.M.s \u2014 are likely to be squeezed, or worse.Faced with visions of a bleak future as low-margin widget-builders for Silicon Valley, automakers have spent the past several years trying to catch up. General Motors spent $581 million to buy Cruise Automation, a self-driving-technology start-up. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles struck a deal with Waymo, in addition to partnering with BMW and Intel. Daimler and Volvo each joined with Uber, and Toyota set up a whole research institute in Silicon Valley to build its own self-driving vehicles.Ford\u2019s plans might be the most ambitious. It wants to have a hand in every part of the self-driving-car industry, including the software that replaces the human driver, the platform that connects and controls the cars and the services that spring up around them. To that end, Ford has spent the past several years quietly snapping up tech talent. It struck a partnership with Lyft and acquired Chariot, a San Francisco-based start-up that runs group shuttles for commuters. It set up an office in Palo Alto that now has 205 employees and created Greenfield Labs, a business incubator. It invested in Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based artificial-intelligence start-up, and several other companies, including Velodyne, which makes Lidar sensors, and a connected-car software outfit called Autonomic.Most industry observers believe these are the right moves for Ford to be making. But it\u2019s still tough to reconcile today\u2019s Ford \u2014 which makes money by selling millions of combustion-engine trucks and S.U.V.s every year, along with a handful of sedans and hybrids \u2014 with the eco-tech-mobility conglomerate Hackett envisions it becoming. One lesson Hackett learned from his studies is that in order to stay competitive, businesses often have to give up the things that made them great in the first place. (He calls this the \u201cperversity law.\u201d) I asked him if this meant that Ford would need to stop manufacturing conventional, gas-powered vehicles to survive.\u201cWell, part of that statement might be right,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He clarified, sort of: \u201cI\u2019m really just trying to say the better form of problem solving is to abstract the problems.\u201dSo let\u2019s try abstracting Ford\u2019s problems, to see how they might be solved. First: Ford was born at the beginning of a now-outmoded era of industrial production, one that it arguably ushered in. Back then, companies like Ford simply manufactured goods, and customers bought them. Those transactions represented a change of ownership \u2014 a customer who bought a car from Ford was free to install 15-inch subwoofers in it, or paint it bright yellow, or use it in a demolition derby \u2014 and they were typically one-time sales. Ford\u2019s responsibility for the car, and its opportunity to make a profit, ended the minute the warranty ran out.The internet changed that, by allowing companies to wrap physical goods in digital services that can be sold again and again, at much higher margins. Instead of selling servers to corporate I.T. departments, Amazon sells them time shares on a centralized server farm; instead of buying pricey home solar panels, customers can lease them from a solar service, paying for only the power they use. Makers of thermostats, baby monitors and other household gadgets \u201cextend the value chain\u201d by charging customers a monthly fee for information about their home energy use or their babies\u2019 sleep patterns. Even the language these new enterprises use is different. Goods-based businesses spoke in terms of revenues and profits. Service-based businesses count metrics like \u201cchurn,\u201d \u201caverage revenue per user\u201d and \u201clifetime value\u201d \u2014 the total amount of money they can wring from a customer.This phenomenon \u2014 which is sometimes referred to as \u201ceverything as a service,\u201d abbreviated as XaaS and pronounced \u201czass,\u201d among the kinds of people who say these things out loud \u2014 has quietly reshaped the entire economy. Trucking companies that once bought Michelin tires now rent them through a pay-per-mile service. Airlines that buy $15 million jet engines from General Electric can subscribe to OnPoint, a \u201cpower by the hour\u201d program that includes maintenance costs and data-analysis tools. G.E. Aviation now makes the better part of its revenue from services like these.The auto industry was slow to come to grips with this new model \u2014 in part because it long ago gave away the entire service piece of its business to gas stations, body shops, Jiffy Lubes and a hundred other barnacle industries. Thanks to old and byzantine state laws, most carmakers aren\u2019t even allowed to sell or lease directly to their customers \u2014 every transaction has to go through an independent dealer. When it comes to data, automakers are flying blind. As Reilly P. Brennan, a venture capitalist who invests in self-driving technology, put it to me: \u201cThe urinal in the men\u2019s bathroom knows more about its users than most carmakers in 2017.\u201dWith self-driving cars, automakers see a chance to fix that. Ford\u2019s executives talk hopefully about one day offering their own suite of software inside their autonomous vehicles, and building interfaces that companies like Netflix and Skype could plug into. They don\u2019t see themselves usurping Silicon Valley, exactly, but they do see themselves playing in the same league. \u201cTwo to three years ago, the tech community was holding the auto industry at arm\u2019s length,\u201d said Ken Washington, Ford\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cThey thought we were sort of this curious industry that they could come into and disrupt.\u201d He went on: \u201cNow, when I go to Silicon Valley and I interact with tech companies, it\u2019s a dynamic of much more intense interest in collaborating with us.\u201dCollaboration takes many forms, of course, and not all tech companies seem interested in an equal partnership. John Krafcik, the chief executive of Waymo, told me that while traditional auto companies \u201cbring a lot to the party\u201d in terms of hardware expertise, they\u2019re not well equipped to solve the software-based problem of replacing a human driver, which requires huge teams of highly skilled engineers and tremendous amounts of technological infrastructure \u2014 the kinds of tools available to only a Google sibling company. \u201cThe self-driving aspect is really supercomplicated,\u201d Krafcik said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last nine years trying to solve that puzzle. It requires a lot of skills.\u201d It also requires focus, which is a problem for companies that still sell millions of conventional cars and trucks a year, that have thousands of employees to pay and quarterly results to deliver, that can\u2019t exactly drop everything and become software companies.In Detroit, cautious optimism prevails. But outside Detroit, there are real doubts that any auto company can transform itself quickly enough. \u201cAutonomous vehicles are not an incremental shift,\u201d said Carol Reiley, a founder of Drive.ai. \u201cIt\u2019s a very transformative shift, almost like moving from the horse and carriage to the car.\u201d Like many tech executives, Reiley saw Detroit\u2019s quest to control the self-driving-car industry as tactically sound but ultimately a long shot. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they can make it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of baggage.\u201dA week after my Detroit trip, I visited the Pittsburgh offices of Argo AI, the artificial-intelligence start-up that is creating the software brains for Ford\u2019s self-driving vehicles. Ford is investing $1 billion for a majority stake and controls two of Argo\u2019s five board seats. Which means that Argo is an independent company, but only barely \u2014 40 of its 230 employees are transfers from Ford, and Ford is its only corporate partner.Argo\u2019s headquarters is in Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District, a formerly industrial area just outside downtown that has become a center of driverless-car activity. (Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Group is down the street.) Its office is a high-ceilinged space in a modern office building with conference rooms named for famous scientists: Planck, Descartes, Hopper. When I arrived, engineers were eating catered lunch at their standing desks. Squint and ignore the smokestacks outside, and you could be in San Francisco \u2014 which is sort of the point. Ford wants Argo to look and feel like a nimble tech start-up, not a subsidiary of a century-old auto company.I was greeted by Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander, Argo AI\u2019s founders, both well-known figures in the small self-driving-car world. They had been special-faculty members at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s prestigious robotics-engineering program, and Salesky competed in the 2007 Darpa Urban Challenge, a storied self-driving-vehicle race whose alumni now populate the top ranks of the autonomous-vehicle industry. Salesky went to Google to build self-driving cars; Rander went to Uber. They quit their jobs and started Argo AI in November of last year, and in February, with no real product to speak of, and hardly any employees, they announced that they had raised huge sums of money from Ford.The day before my visit, Salesky made waves with a bombastic post on the company\u2019s blog, in which he accused the autonomous-vehicle industry of overselling its progress. \u201cThose who think fully self-driving vehicles will be ubiquitous on city streets months from now or even in a few years,\u201d he wrote, \u201care not well connected to the state of the art or committed to the safe deployment of the technology.\u201d It was a rare role reversal \u2014 the software engineer throwing up caution flags \u2014 and, perhaps, evidence that Ford is trying to stall for time. Officially, Argo is still aiming for Ford\u2019s 2021 target, but Salesky waffled on the firmness of that deadline, saying there\u2019s a chance a true Level 4 autonomous vehicle could be finished later, or possibly sooner. \u201cIt\u2019s ready when it\u2019s ready,\u201d he told me.Salesky freely admitted that he is playing catch-up. Ford won\u2019t share statistics about its self-driving test cars, but public records from California give some sense of what it\u2019s up against. Last year, Ford, which does most of its testing in Michigan and Arizona, logged just 590 autonomous miles in the state, while Waymo\u2019s vehicles logged 635,867 miles. Argo is also building its code from scratch and doesn\u2019t have access to the digital infrastructure that competitors like Waymo and Uber do. \u201cWe\u2019re not out there trying to tell everyone we\u2019re going to be first or beat X, Y or Z company,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cThe goal is to get to market with something that can scale up.\u201dIn order to work properly, a self-driving car also has to understand how humans behave. It needs to know the difference between a car that is idling in the right-hand lane (in which case the autonomous vehicle should steer around it) and one that is about to parallel park (in which case the vehicle should stay in its lane, giving the other car some room). It needs to predict that the jogger running toward the corner will stop for traffic, but that the kid running to chase a basketball might not. It needs to be able to navigate a four-way stop, which in polite parts of the country involves lots of eye contact and you-first hand gestures. \u201cThis goes beyond just seeing and understanding the world,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cIt means understanding what each of the actors in the world is going to do.\u201dIn other words, driving isn\u2019t just a mechanical task \u2014 it\u2019s a social act, and in order to coexist with human drivers, self-driving cars will need to develop a level of social awareness that approaches that of a full-fledged A.I. This is why some computer scientists think Waymo is going to be unbeatable. As an Alphabet company, Waymo has access to some of the best engineering talent in A.I., along with Google\u2019s enormous data troves and the machine-learning systems that have been trained using that data. In other words, the vast data-harvesting powers that make Google\u2019s consumer products so creepy could also make Waymo\u2019s vehicles better at navigating the physical world.But all this obsessive focus on tech elides a much more foundational question about our relationship to cars. Tech companies tend to view driving as a functional problem \u2014 get safely from Point A to Point B as quickly as possible \u2014 in which the vehicle itself is largely an extraneous variable. A car might begin its life as a Toyota or a Hyundai, but once it\u2019s autonomous and on a ride-sharing network, it\u2019s just an Uber. Silicon Valley believes that software, not hardware, is what matters to riders, and this will be especially true of self-driving cars \u2014 which, at least in early days, will most likely be shared among strangers.But Detroit has spent decades and billions of advertising dollars persuading us that its mass-produced cars are anything but homogeneous metal boxes \u2014 that they carry profound talismanic qualities that transfer to their owners. You can be an F-150 woman or a Mustang man, and those choices signal tribal affiliations that extend far past the act of driving. Ford\u2019s challenge, then, is keeping these storied brands alive for the consumers who still obsess over them, while Argo builds the software that will satisfy the car-agnostic city dwellers. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act, made even more complicated by the politics of a 114-year-old Detroit manufacturing company lashing its fate to a one-year-old Pittsburgh tech start-up, and vice versa. \u201cThey\u2019ve put a lot of trust in us,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also put a lot of trust in them.\u201dBill Ford has been working in the family business for 38 years and spent most of that time as an iconoclast. His interest in \u201csmart mobility\u201d \u2014 which amounts to an interest in reducing the number of cars on the road \u2014 was until recently considered heretical. But the past few years have vindicated his predictions. He thinks that the coming convergence of tech and transportation could turn Detroit and Silicon Valley into permanent collaborators. He started Fontinalis Partners, a venture-capital fund outside Ford, to invest in mobility start-ups, and flies regularly to San Francisco to meet with entrepreneurs working on transportation-related projects.\u201cThe narrative, probably even two years ago, would have been \u2018tech companies win, autos lose,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened, though, is there\u2019s been a realization that we have a lot more intellectual property than the world realized,\u201d by which he means celebrated lines like the F-150, along with some proprietary under-the-hood technology that I won\u2019t pretend to understand. \u201cSecond, we really know how to integrate a lot of what the tech companies have into our vehicles, and we know how to make vehicles as well.\u201dI was struck by how frequently this simple point is deployed at Ford: We know how to make stuff, and making stuff isn\u2019t easy. At first, I dismissed it as a na\u00efve attempt to steer a conversation about Detroit\u2019s shortcomings back toward its strengths. Apple taught suppliers halfway across the world how to make iPhones with micron-level precision \u2014 how hard could it be to slap some metal together and put it on wheels?But making cars isn\u2019t like making other things. It\u2019s a dizzying logistical ballet that involves heavy machinery, grueling labor and countless opportunities for error. It\u2019s wrangling union contracts while keeping the line moving. It\u2019s paying people enough to ensure that they won\u2019t miss a loose bolt and kill someone. It\u2019s designing objects that not only work well but also fill a psychological need for buyers. In the end, maybe the self-driving-car race will be decided not purely on technological achievement, but also on these much more prosaic questions \u2014 who can make good things and persuade people to use them? After all, the Model T wasn\u2019t the first car invented, or the best at the time.

{"Headline": "Senate Republicans Scramble to Find Revenue for Tax Bill With Vote Expected Friday", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 The Senate will not vote on its tax bill tonight. It will convene at 10 a.m. Friday to continue the debate on taxes.\u2022 Republicans are considering raising some taxes down the road to help offset the cost of their tax bill after the Senate parliamentarian rejected the idea of a trigger that would have automatically increased taxes if economic growth fell short of projections.\u2022 Congress\u2019s bipartisan tax referee said that economic growth induced by the tax cut would only offset $458 billion of its cost over the next decade. The analysis put the bill\u2019s total price at $1 trillion, contradicting the Republican argument that the measure would essentially pay for itself.\u2022 Earlier in the day, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who had been undecided about the bill, said he would vote yes, but Senator Susan Collins of Maine said she remained undecided.\u2022 Though Republicans sound optimistic, party leaders still do not have firm commitments from enough senators to ensure the bill will pass.Senate Republicans are scrambling to figure out how to offset the deficit effects of the bill after the Senate parliamentarian rejected a trigger mechanism that would have automatically increased taxes if economic growth projections were not met. Several Republican senators, including Bob Corker of Tennessee, have expressed concerns about piling up debt as a result of the tax overhaul.One idea being discussed is reinstating the alternative minimum tax on some corporations and individuals. There is also discussion about increasing the corporate tax rate above the 20 percent after a period of years. This could involve slowly raising the rate after some time, though it is unclear when it would take place.Senate Republicans\u2019 tax cut would not pay for itself, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.The committee, which serves as the nonpartisan scorekeeper for growth and revenue estimates in tax bills, estimated that the Senate bill would boost economic growth by 0.8 percent over a decade. Republicans have said they expect substantially stronger growth than that to result from the tax cuts.Throughout the tax debate over the last month, Republican leaders have frequently cited other analyses by the committee in order to make their case for the bill.The committee said economic growth generated by the tax cut will offset losses by about $458 billion over the next decade. Over that same period, an additional $51 billion would be needed for interest costs.\u201cOverall, the budgetary effects of changes in economic growth are projected to reduce the deficit by $407 billion during the budget window,\u201d the committee said.A spokeswoman for Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who leads the Finance Committee, said the joint committee\u2019s analysis understates the actual economic growth and is not based on the current version of the bill.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said the analysis \u201cends the fantasy about magical growth and claims that tax cuts pay for themselves.\u201d\u201cWhat it proves is that this bill offers very little other than a holiday bonanza to multinational corporations and special interests,\u201d he said.Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona who was the deciding vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act, said on Thursday that he will vote in favor of the Senate tax cut bill.\u201cI believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle class families,\u201d Mr. McCain said in a statement.Some Republicans were worried that Mr. McCain could vote against the bill because of his sour relationship with President Trump. But Mr. McCain said that he was satisfied that the tax overhaul went through \u201cregular order\u201d in the Senate, with sufficient public hearings and opportunities for amendments.While he said he remained concerned about the deficit and acknowledged that the tax bill is not perfect, Mr. McCain said that on balance it would be good for the country. \u201cIt\u2019s clear this bill\u2019s net effect on our economy would be positive,\u201d Mr. McCain said.Senator Susan Collins remains a key senator to watch, given she has yet to commit to the bill and could be the deciding vote between a tax bill that passes and one that fails. On Thursday, Ms. Collins outlined some of her priorities and concerns at a breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor.On her vote:Ms. Collins said she remained concerned about the effect of the Senate plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act mandate that most Americans buy insurance or pay a penalty and also wanted to ensure that taxpayers could continue to deduct some state and local taxes, a provision known as SALT.\u201cThe SALT amendment is extremely important to me. The health care agreement is extremely important for me. It would be very difficult for me to support the bill if I do not prevail on those two issues,\u201d she said.Ms. Collins said that as of Thursday morning she was optimistic about the measures after conversations with President Trump and Senate leaders.Still, \u201cI am not committed to vote for this bill because who knows what is going to happen on the Senate floor.\u201dOn the corporate tax rate:Ms. Collins said she was open to nudging the corporate tax rate above the 20 percent currently envisioned in the Senate bill.\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to go to 20 percent on the corporate tax side,\u201d she said. Senators have begun discussions about raising the rate to 22 percent, which would still be a big cut from the current 35 percent corporate tax rate.On automatic spending cuts that could be required by tax bill:\u201cI strongly oppose that. I have written a letter to Mitch McConnell asking what is the plan to avert that. I met with Senator McConnell just yesterday and he has assured me that will not be allowed to happen.\u201dMs. Collins said she expected that a waiver of the so-called Paygo requirements would be included in a year-end spending bill.On an amendment that would close the carried interest loophole:\u201cI would make refundable the tax credit for child or adult dependent care. I would pay for it by closing the loophole on carried interest.\u201dThe Senate tax bill has been marketed by Republicans as a tax cut for the middle class. How would people in your income group fare?The politically powerful Koch network warned Republican senators on Thursday not to adopt a last-minute change to their tax bill that helps low-income parents in exchange for a slightly smaller cut in the corporate tax rate.Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah have filed an amendment to the bill that would allow low-income workers to use an expanded child tax credit to offset payroll taxes, not just income taxes; the distinction matters for families that do not currently face income tax liability. The senators propose paying for the move by reducing the corporate rate to 22 percent instead of 20 percent from the current 35 percent rate.Mr. Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said he did not believe there was any willingness on the House side to increase the corporate rate above 20 percent.\u201cI think we believe that is a rate that makes us, America, much more competitive, and we know from studies that had we had that rate, we\u2019d have many more jobs and businesses and facilities here in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we continue to stay focused on the 20 percent.\u201dJust a reminder that if the Senate passes its tax bill, it will need to reconcile the differences with the House version before a final bill can be sent to Mr. Trump.The Senate cleared a procedural hurdle on Wednesday with its vote to begin debating the tax bill, and early remarks from lawmakers offered a preview of what that debate will probably center on.\u201cThis is an historic day as the Senate begins consideration of tax reform that will help boost America\u2019s economy, that will create more jobs and that will leave more money in people\u2019s paychecks,\u201d Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and the chairman of the Budget Committee, said on Wednesday.Mr. Enzi offered a warning about the coming debate.\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to hear a lot of screaming going on in speeches this week,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t confuse volume with veracity or truth.\u201dMr. Wyden offered another kind of warning.\u201cThe Senate is 20 hours of debate away from a broken promise of truly historic proportions,\u201d he said on Wednesday. This year, he said, was supposed to be when \u201cthe working people of America regained a powerful voice in Washington.\u201d\u201cInstead of a strong voice, what they got instead was a big con job,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cIf this Republican tax bill passes, Washington is going to reach into the pockets of working Americans and cut a big check to multinational corporations, to tax cheats and to the politically powerful and well-connected.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, criticized Republicans for how they had undertaken the tax overhaul, complaining that they had shut out Democrats as they put together their bill.Mr. Schumer said the Republican tax bill had made \u201ca mockery of the legislative process,\u201d and he pleaded for Republicans to work with Democrats on taxes instead of moving forward with the current tax plan.\u201cIf my Republican friends close the door on their partisan tax bill tonight,\u201d he said, \u201cthey will find an open door for bipartisan tax reform tomorrow.\u201dThe administration pledged official support on Thursday for the tax bill pending in the Senate, an unsurprising move that confirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to a Missouri crowd on Wednesday that he would sign the bill if it reached his desk.\u201cThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage\u201d of the bill, officials wrote in a statement of administrative policy, because it would reduce taxes for businesses and middle class families and simplify the tax code. The statement also praised provisions in the bill to repeal the individual health insurance mandate under the Affordable Care Act and to open part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling.If the bill were presented to Mr. Trump, the statement said, \u201chis advisers would recommend that he sign the bill into law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "ISIS, Squeezed on Two Sides, Loses Syrian City and Border Crossing", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT \u2014 Islamic State militants lost their last foothold in a major city and a strategic border crossing on Friday, as the Syrian and Iraqi militaries made significant advances, squeezing the militant group into a shrinking patch of territory near the border.Syrian government forces, supported by intense Russian airstrikes and Iranian-backed militias on the ground, drove the militants from the last few neighborhoods they controlled in the eastern provincial capital of Deir al-Zour, the Syrian army said.Across the border, the Iraqi army and allied Iranian-backed militias seized control of a crucial border crossing after taking most of the town of Qaim, Iraq, from the Islamic State, according to the Iraqi military chief of staff.The military advances dealt a severe blow to the militant group, leaving it with fragments of its self-declared caliphate that once stretched from the center of Syria to the outskirts of Baghdad. They also provided yet another indication that President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s fortunes have rebounded and that, with help from Russian and Iranian allies, the Syrian army can take back territory.The Islamic State now maintains just a few pockets of western Anbar Province in Iraq and somewhat larger patches in Syria, where it controls about a third of the desert province of Deir al-Zour, including a string of small towns and villages, and an oil field.The developments also set the stage for a battle for the Syrian border town of Bukamal, on the strategic highway from Baghdad to Damascus, and what appears to be the end game for the remaining Islamic State territory in Iraq and Syria.The seizing of Deir al-Zour punctuates the turnaround Mr. Assad has managed in more than six years of war. Just two years ago, the idea that the government would manage to take back the city seemed remote.When the Syrian war broke out in 2011, soldiers were defecting from the Syrian army and only a fraction of the troops could be counted on for loyalty in the field. But Mr. Assad hit hard at rebel-held neighborhoods, pummeling Syrian cities with airstrikes with the support of Iran and its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah.In 2015, Russia entered the war on Mr. Assad\u2019s behalf, carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic State and other insurgent factions. Russia\u2019s backing allowed Mr. Assad\u2019s forces to focus on one front at a time. Once the non-Islamic State insurgents were contained, the pro-government alliance turned its attention to the Islamic State, which it has now mostly routed.Still, Mr. Assad is faced with running a country that is still divided, politically and territorially, where major cities are devastated, the security forces deeply dependent on Russia and Iran, and the economy gutted.The militants never controlled the whole of the city of Deir al-Zour, although they held most of the surrounding province, an oil-rich region that provided an important source of revenue.For two and a half years, though, the Islamic State had surrounded and besieged 200,000 civilians in the government-held section of the city. Its population dwindled to 90,000, the United Nations estimates, as people escaped or were smuggled out.Now, the group\u2019s most important territory is the border town of Bukamal and the border crossing on the Syrian side. Iraqi forces claimed the other side of the border on Friday, along with most of Qaim, Bukamal\u2019s counterpart on the Iraqi side.That battle for the remaining Islamic State territory could inflame tensions among the competing forces fighting the militants as they converge on the region: the Russian and Iranian-backed alliance that supports the Syrian government; the rival American-backed group, Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F.; and the Iraqi forces that are pursuing Islamic State holdouts on their side of the border.The stakes are high, with the competing armies seeking not only to vanquish the Islamic State, but also racing against each other to win influence in the strategic border zone.Russia, which wants the Syrian government to reclaim all of its territory, and the United States, which wants to counter Iranian influence, have accused each other of firing at their respective allies on the ground.The S.D.F., a Kurdish and Arab alliance, wants to seize as much territory as possible, including oil fields. Those resources and points of leverage could increase its chances of staving off a government takeover of the areas it holds, including Raqqa and the areas to the northeast where Kurds have carved out a measure of autonomy.Iran wants the friendly Syrian government to control the area. With Iraq already a strong ally, Iran could establish a land route linking it with Lebanon, the base of its most powerful allied militia in the region, Hezbollah.Once the Islamic State is driven out, cities like Raqqa may be the next front. A top Iranian official said Friday that the Syrian government and its allies would soon take Raqqa from the American-backed S.D.F.A look at what the Islamic State controlled at different stages of its military dominance.According to IRNA, Iran\u2019s semiofficial news agency, Ali Akbar Velayati, a foreign affairs adviser to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, said that Raqqa and its surroundings \u201cwill be liberated\u201d and the Syrian government would take control. \u201cThe U.S. is planning to partition Syria,\u201d the agency quoted him as saying. \u201cIt will never achieve anything in the field.\u201dThe battle on the Iraqi side of the Iraqi-Syrian border on Friday involved Iraq\u2019s elite counterterrorism units, the Iraqi army, the federal police and Iraqi paramilitaries supported by Iran. American military advisers have been working with the Iraqi army and special forces, and the United States provided air support to the Iraqi ground forces on Friday, according to Gen. Yihya Rasool, the spokesman of the Iraqi joint operations command.The Iraqi chief of staff said the Iraqis\u2019 advance gave them and their American-led coalition allies a forward operating position to monitor any remaining Islamic State fighters fleeing the converging armies.An Iraqi Sunni tribal leader whose members also took part in the fighting said that the Islamic State\u2019s foreign fighters had fled Qaim before the final push by the Iraqi forces on Friday. The leader, Sheikh Qutri al-Ubaidi, said that the majority moved their families across the Syrian border in the direction of Bukamal.Sheikh Ubaidi said several Islamic State fighters remained in Iraqi territory, hidden along the banks of the Euphrates River that flows between the two countries. Several Islamic State supporters also fled Qaim in boats across the river toward Rumana, Iraq, he said.As of Friday night, at least two Iraqi towns \u2014 Rumana, northwest of Qaim, and Rawa, to the east \u2014 were still under Islamic State control.The news from Deir al-Zour cheered some of the tens of thousands of its residents who are displaced across Syria and the region, though, as with Raqqa, it did not mean they could go home any time soon, given the intense destruction and the danger of land mines and Islamic State sleeper cells that may remain there.\u201cWe fled from the intensive bombings because we could not stay there any more,\u201d said Alia Mohamed, 33, at a park in Damascus where she watched her 4-year-old daughter \u2014 one of her six children \u2014 run around as her husband tried to find a room for the family.At a school shelter in Qudsaya, a suburb northwest of Damascus, Hosna Quray\u2019a, who said that she had been displaced for two years, greeted the news with \u201cgreat joy.\u201d\u201cI want to return,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of my relatives left there, and I don\u2019t know what happened to them.\u201dIbrahim Haj Hussein, a 14-year-old from the government-controlled part of Deir al-Zour, traveled to the shelter eight months ago because his mother was sick. He left his father behind. The price of food was so high that his family had subsisted on a diet of bulgur wheat and rice, he said, adding, \u201cThe situation there was really tough.\u201dAnne Barnard reported from Beirut, and Margaret Coker from Dohuk, Iraq.

{"Headline": "Republicans Search for Proof Their Tax Plans Will Pay for Themselves", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican leaders keep insisting that their plans to cut taxes by $1.5 trillion over the next decade will not add to the national debt \u2014 yet economic analyses of the Senate and House proposals keep predicting that the plans will do just that.The disconnect is prompting House and Senate Republican leaders and the Trump administration to hunt down \u2014 and promote \u2014 more optimistic forecasts, even if they exclude large parts of the tax bills from their analyses or assume growth-boosting features that are not, in fact, in the bills.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a political organization, you\u2019re constantly model shopping,\u201d said Kent Smetters, a former economic adviser in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, who is now the faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania.In an interview on Friday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said that \u201cwe\u2019re confident that the $1.5 trillion gap would be filled\u201d by economic growth. Mr. McConnell said the tax bill would add 0.4 percentage points to annual economic growth, though he did not cite a specific analysis suggesting that assertion. \u201cSo we believe this is a responsible budget and a responsible tax reform,\u201d he said.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin insisted last week that the House bill would not add to the deficit, even after an analysis by the independent Tax Foundation, which uses a model that tends to find large growth effects from tax cuts, found that the bill would add $1 trillion to deficits over a decade.\u201cWe believe that we\u2019re going to be fine on that,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cWe believe that when you look at other analysis, whether it\u2019s going to be Treasury or the rest, that we\u2019re right there in the sweet spot, with economic growth that gives us more revenue with where we need to be.\u201dThe House is preparing to vote on a tax overhaul bill this week, while the Senate Finance Committee begins amending a companion version, as part of a whirlwind push to deliver tax legislation to President Trump\u2019s desk by Christmas.The Treasury Department has not yet released any economic analysis of the congressional plans. Economists at Goldman Sachs said last month that they expect tax cuts to generate enough additional growth to offset about a fifth of their revenue losses. That means $1 trillion of net tax cuts would lose $800 billion on a dynamic basis.Dynamic scoring is inexact in the best of circumstances. Under the compressed congressional schedule this fall, it is even more difficult, said Alan J. Auerbach, a University of California, Berkeley, economist who is widely considered a godfather of modern dynamic scoring models.As a result, only a few models have churned out consistent dynamic analyses that attempt to account for all the provisions of the House and Senate bills. The Tax Foundation has one. Mr. Smetters and his Penn Wharton team have another. Perhaps the most important scorekeeper on that front, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, is due to weigh in this week, with an analysis of the bill pending in the House.Ironically, the models that so far have produced the least optimistic forecasts for the Republican plan are the ones that most closely track the assumptions conservatives have long espoused about the economy: that racking up deficits and debt will hold back growth.That is the case with the Penn Wharton model, which finds that the House bill would lose between $1 trillion and $1.7 trillion over a decade in revenue, after accounting for growth, depending on various assumptions about the flow of investment dollars in the global economy and the growth-stoking power of tax cuts. The Tax Foundation\u2019s more optimistic model projects the Senate bill would lose $500 billion in revenue after growth effects.The one model so far to suggest that the bills could fully pay for themselves comes from a Boston University economist, Laurence J. Kotlikoff, who employs what he calls a more comprehensive view of the global economy\u2019s dynamics than other economists do. Mr. Kotlikoff\u2019s analysis finds large growth effects from the House and Senate\u2019s plans to cut top corporate tax rates to 20 percent from 35 percent today. It makes some growth-boosting assumptions that differ from the bills as drafted, and it essentially excludes the impacts of personal income tax changes on the economy; other models find those changes would affect growth and revenue.Mr. Kotlikoff\u2019s approach has been criticized by several liberal economists, including Jason Furman, a former top economist for President Barack Obama, who now gives slide-show presentations on what he calls the \u201cseven deadly sins of overly optimistic dynamic scoring.\u201dMr. Kotlikoff\u2019s model commits several of those sins, Mr. Furman said, including Sin No. 2: \u201cUse estimates from \u2018similar\u2019 tax plans that are not similar.\u201dLast week, Mr. Kotlikoff was on the phone with a reporter, explaining the intricacies of his model, when a call came in on the other line from a staff member of the House Ways and Means Committee.\u201cThey\u2019re interested because it supports their view, right?\u201d Mr. Kotlikoff said, referring to the Ways and Means staff member. He then resumed explaining why that should be the case \u2014 why his model was better than others at predicting the path of growth.Mr. Auerbach, who has teamed up with Mr. Kotlikoff on past tax studies, but not the current effort, said he was skeptical that the Republican plans would generate enough growth and revenue to pay for themselves. \u201cTo say that it might happen is one thing,\u201d he said. \u201cTo say you expect it to happen is quite different.\u201dMr. Auerbach cautioned that he was speaking from informed opinion \u2014 and not from the results of any modeling.Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retail Jobs Don\u2019t Need to Be Bad. Here\u2019s Proof.", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThis raises a fairly urgent question: If retail work sets the living standard for so many low-income families, why doesn\u2019t it get more attention?Perhaps policymakers believe that undesirable sales jobs are inevitable features of the economic landscape; that the lot of poorly paid cashiers results from powerful market forces like automation and globalization over which they have little control. The truth is that retail work doesn\u2019t have to be so unpleasant. A quick look around Europe underscores that retailers can profit, even thrive, and still provide their workers a better deal.They concluded that for all the power of market forces, from automation taking over routine tasks to globalization squeezing retailers\u2019 margins, there is nothing inevitable about low-quality retail jobs. Social norms and political institutions can make them better, or worse.In the United States, 42 percent of retail workers earn a low hourly wage \u2014 defined as less than two-thirds of the median wage across the economy. In Denmark, only 23 percent of retail workers earn so little; in France, only 18 percent. And labor turnover in the American retail industry is twice as high as it is in Britain and the Netherlands.European retailers employ part-time workers more often. But full-time workers in the United States sometimes fare no better: Retailers will cut their hours to avoid paying overtime. What\u2019s more, American retailers face few barriers to altering schedules to fit consumer demand, forcing employees to be available at any time even if they work few hours.Unions, of course, play a major role. Fewer than 5 percent of retail workers in the United States are represented by a union. In Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Germany, by contrast, multi-employer union agreements determine wages and working conditions across regions in the entire sector. Notably, retailers in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands have to negotiate scheduling with unions and often must post schedules weeks in advance.Other institutions matter. In the United States, part-time retail workers earn two-thirds of the hourly wage of full-timers. In the European Union, they must be paid the same. Premium pay for late-night and weekend shifts in Europe also improve pay. Universal child care \u2014 common in countries like France \u2014 also affects the labor supply, freeing mothers to seek full-time work. Germany\u2019s apprenticeship system provides retailers with workers who have more skills and can take on a greater variety of tasks.These things tend to come together. When I asked what change would most improve the lives of retail workers in the United States, Professor Carr\u00e9 said the minimum wage, mandated or subsidized health care and mandated sick days made a big difference. Still, she argued, \u201cyou don\u2019t get those things without a strong labor movement.\u201dThis is not to say that retail jobs are great in France or the Netherlands. Indeed, Professors Carr\u00e9 and Tilly find that these jobs are gradually getting worse everywhere, as European retailers seek workarounds to avoid labor regulations. But while wages and working conditions have steadily deteriorated in the United States, the decline in Europe hasn\u2019t been as general.\u201cNew regulatory initiatives, such as high minimum wages, have partially reversed trends toward falling compensation,\u201d the researchers wrote.And what is critical is that European retailers can afford this: the researchers found that large food stores in France sell about twice as much per hour as American stores. Value added per employee is about 12 percent higher. And French stores sell about three times as much per square foot, not least because of tight zoning regulations that limit their size.This is not to say that European culture is somehow more labor-friendly. Professors Carr\u00e9 and Tilly observe that when European retailers come to the United States, they tend to adopt American norms.Europe\u2019s choices do entail costs. Notably, American consumers benefit from the more intense competition among retailers in the United States. In areas with weak zoning regulations, where Walmart can easily enter and undercut other retailers\u2019 prices, this is particularly true. In France, where barriers to entry are high, competition is weaker and retailers are more profitable. They can afford to give workers a better deal.Still, it is important to understand that this is a choice. There is nothing inevitable about dead-end jobs. As the United States struggles with stagnating wages and widening inequality, giving bottom-end workers a better deal might not be a bad choice \u2014 and $13 an hour is one place to start.Advertisement"}

Henriques is an award-winning financial journalist and a best-selling chronicler of the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme. Her new book focuses on a 30-years-ago crisis \u2014 the Black Monday debacle of 1987 when the stock market turned in a one-day loss that, on a percentage basis, was almost twice as large as the steepest drop in 1929. In making her case for the importance of the 1987 crash, Henriques has produced a valuable and unfailingly interesting account of a crucial two-decade period in Wall Street history \u2014 when markets made a full-bore transition from serving individual investors to a system dominated by giant corporations, mostly trading for themselves, and competing by means of arcane computer algorithms and spectacular processing speeds.A portentous milestone was passed when the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or \u201cthe Merc,\u201d started trading financial futures on a host of instruments \u2014 Treasury note interest rates, government-issued mortgage bonds, foreign currencies and various stock index futures, like Value Line and the S & P 500 stock indexes.

When the insurance algorithms were triggered, computers would sell futures to lock in a pricing floor, and then reverse the process as markets recovered. The concept was simple, but its execution requirements were formidable.Skeptical customers asked what would happen if the markets didn\u2019t step up and buy futures at \u201crational\u201d prices. That was easily waved off. Yes, in panicky markets, the futures clearing prices might be lower than the rational price, but canny traders would soon recognize the bargains on offer. That glibly danced by a scarier issue, however \u2014 the sheer scale of portfolios that were protected by insurance. A truly serious downturn could trigger huge robotic futures sales that could overwhelm the capacities of the traders.And that duly happened on Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987. After several weeks of slipping markets, floods of computer-driven futures orders hit the Chicago markets, overwhelming their systems and driving a steep plunge in futures prices, many all the way to zero, which signaled no bids at all. As futures prices collapsed, the implacable insurance algorithms accelerated the selling. Henriques gives us a gripping, almost minute-by-minute account of the weeks that followed, including the posturings, the denials and the panics, as well as the \u201cweb of trust, pluck and improvisation\u201d that pulled the markets through.Summing up the crisis, Henriques places blame on \u201cdisparate, blindly competitive and increasingly automated markets \u2026 gigantic and increasingly like-minded institutional investors\u201d and \u201ca regulatory community that was poorly equipped, ridiculously fragmented, technologically na\u00efve and fatally focused on protecting turf.\u201dHenriques overstates her case, however, when she writes that \u201cmore than a trillion dollars in wealth had been lost.\u201d And she cites a comment from President Reagan at an impromptu news conference during the worst days of the crisis that \u201call the business indices are up. There is nothing wrong with the economy,\u201d which she compares to Herbert Hoover\u2019s complacency in 1930.Actually, Reagan was right. The economy was fine. From 1986 through 1989, real (inflation-adjusted) growth was 3.5 percent, 3.5 percent, 4.2 percent and 3.7 percent. The 1980s stock market was a roller coaster. It opened with historically low price-earnings ratios, which allowed canny leveraged buyout investors to snap up solid companies at bargain prices. As copycat investors flooded into the buyout markets, the quality of deals deteriorated \u2014 laughably, one major acquisition was insolvent on the day the deal closed. The trillion-dollar drop in market values was just a recognition of reality. The saps who took the losses were counterbalanced by the lucky investors who got their money out in time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morocco Food Stampede Leaves 15 Dead and a Country Shaken", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMARRAKESH, Morocco \u2014 At least 15 women died and five were wounded in a stampede during a food distribution operation on Sunday morning in rural Morocco, government officials said.The victims were crushed as hundreds of people, mostly women, gathered to collect baskets of food at the market of a small town, Sidi Boulaalam, according to news accounts. The town is about 40 miles from the coastal city of Essaouira.In the aftermath of the stampede, clothes and other personal items were left scattered across the ground.It is unclear what led to the stampede. The Moroccan Interior Ministry, which reported the death toll, said it had opened an investigation. The donor who organized the food distribution has not been publicly identified.And there are troubling signs nationwide. The government expects the economy to grow by 3.2 percent in 2018, down from 4.8 percent this year.During the Arab Spring, the government spent billions to calm protests, and amid pressure from international lenders in recent years it has cut spending on subsidies and public sector hiring. Unemployment is high \u2014 over 10 percent, according to the High Commission for Planning, a Moroccan state-run agency.Still, photos that emerged from the stampede left many taken aback on Sunday.\u201cThe image speaks loudly about the precariousness people live in,\u201d said Mehdi Lahlou, an economist and professor at the National Institute of Statistics and Applied Economics in Rabat.\u201cMany initiatives have failed because of the way projects were handled. Spending is not monitored,\u201d Mr. Lahlou said. \u201cIn this particular case, it seems that the event was badly organized and the local authorities did not take the necessary measures to prevent this from happening.\u201dThe Essaouira region, a popular tourism hub, is also known for producing argan oil, which is used in beauty products. In the last decades, many cooperatives have been created to help local women benefit from the production of the oil.Asma Chaabi, a member of Parliament from Essaouira, said the task of improving people\u2019s lives was daunting.\u201cThis is an area that is very rich in terms of natural resources,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is a lot of work that needs to be done in order to advance human development, especially when it concerns the youth and women.\u201dAt the market on Sunday, many who were injured were taken to hospitals in Essaouira and Marrakesh. A witness cited by local news reports said the donor had been distributing flour, cooking oil and sugar when the stampede broke out.King Mohammed has ordered the local authorities to take all necessary measures to provide support and assistance to the families of the dead and injured, the statement from the interior ministry said. The king also pledged to pay the burial and hospitalization expenses for all of the victims.Omar Arbib, a Marrakesh member of the Moroccan Association of Human Rights, said the Essaouira hospital was poorly equipped.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that people are dying for a little bit of food,\u201d he said.\u201cA huge amount of people died today, and the government is responsible for it,\u201d Mr. Arbib said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t even talking about human rights anymore but about the basic needs of the Moroccan people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just as in 1980, Zimbabwe\u2019s Celebration May Be Short-Lived", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy the thousands upon thousands, the people thronged the streets, waving banners, chanting slogans. A long-awaited future was fast approaching their land, Zimbabwe. One name was on all their lips: Robert Mugabe.His return came at the start of a roller-coaster transition from white minority rule in Britain\u2019s last African colony to an independent Zimbabwe.In the weeks that followed his return, Mr. Mugabe survived assassination attempts, threatened to walk away from the peace deal reached under British auspices in London in late 1979 and won a landslide victory in elections that paved the way for independence on April 18, 1980.The pageantry ended an era that began in 1890, when the first colonial settlers arrived in the so-called Pioneer Column to take over farmland and prospect for gold and other mineral riches. They gave the country new borders and a new name, Rhodesia, for Cecil John Rhodes, the British arch-colonialist. Some arrived in such expectation of riches that they called it Africa\u2019s El Dorado.In Rufaro Stadium, in April 1980, it seemed that colonialism\u2019s tenure had been brief indeed. A hint of tear gas wafted over a wall from some indistinct encounter outside the stadium. Inside, the Union flag of Britain was furled and a band played \u201cGod Save the Queen.\u201d The new Zimbabwean banner caught briefly on the flagpole, delaying freedom for a few seconds. But the moment of joy could not be denied.I recall driving with a colleague \u2014 both of us white \u2014 through poor areas populated mainly by Zimbabweans who had little to thank white people for beyond menial jobs. Yet everywhere we were welcomed, embraced and invited to quaff chibuku, a sorghum beer popular among the less affluent.The jubilation and the sense of renewal that suffused Zimbabwe in 1980 dissipated during the 37 years of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s uninterrupted and increasingly despotic rule. But those same ardent passions resurfaced powerfully over the weekend, inspired by the clamor for Mr. Mugabe to go \u2014 as if the country had drawn a parabola beginning and ending in hope but passing on its course through violence, oppression and impoverishment.Looking back, should the clues to what was to come have been visible as a subplot, at least, to the rejoicing? And what omens might they offer for a post-Mugabe era?As a white resident of Harare, the first months of independence were a honeymoon, offered by Mr. Mugabe in gestures of reconciliation from a leader who had not wanted the war to end until he could claim a military victory.But for the Ndebele people in the country\u2019s southwest, the moment of harmony was short-lived. One of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s first decisive political moves was to crush resistance among the Ndebele minority and to marginalize its leader, Joshua Nkomo, an erstwhile ally who had once seemed to be the patriarch of the struggle.I remember ducking for cover in November 1980 as former guerrillas from Mr. Nkomo\u2019s and Mr. Mugabe\u2019s liberation armies traded fire in Entumbane, a township outside Bulawayo. Infinitely worse was to come, when Mr. Mugabe sent the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade into Matabeleland, Mr. Nkomo\u2019s heartland, to crush dissent. At least 10,000 people died, most of them civilians.There were other omens that seemed to be recurring. Then, as it still is today, the seven-year guerrilla war against white minority rule was the font of legitimacy. On Jan. 27, 1980, when Mr. Mugabe returned from Mozambique in a tailored safari suit, he raised a clenched fist in victory. The crowd roared its approval.A few weeks later, I saw armored military vehicles in position at strategic intersections on my drive into work. There was much fevered speculation that the white-led Rhodesian Army, which did not consider itself to have lost the war in any military sense, was planning to intervene to reverse history. It never did. Last week, in an eerie reprise of those days, the Zimbabwean Army sent its troops and armored vehicles onto the same streets to begin Mr. Mugabe\u2019s slow-motion ouster.Yet, the bulk of Zimbabweans are \u201cborn-frees\u201d with no direct memory of a conflict that roiled the land. It was a brutal, sometimes dirty war, fought in skirmishes around white homesteads and in the remote bush, along dirt trails sown with land mines and in bloody raids by Rhodesian troops into neighboring countries where the guerrillas had their rear bases, notably Zambia and Mozambique.Small wonder then that the guerrillas\u2019 victory inspired such outpourings among those in whose name the war had been fought.At every step, as independence morphed into economic collapse, rigged elections and despotic rule, Mr. Mnangagwa was at Mr. Mugabe\u2019s shoulder. Some called him the president\u2019s enforcer.Both men had grown up in a rough neighborhood. Both understood the rules that bind loyalty to largess. When he won power in 1980, Mr. Mugabe promised inclusiveness and pragmatism \u2014 pledges likely to be repeated by Mr. Mnangagwa.Both men were part of the network of patronage that has cemented the ZANU-PF elite in power. When Mr. Mnangagwa was chosen on Sunday as the party\u2019s new leader, some outsiders may have been reminded of an old Sicilian adage coined by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa: Everything must change so that nothing will change.But there are differences. Mr. Mugabe took over a viable economy and infrastructure. White-owned farms produced crops that fed the region and tobacco that earned foreign currency. Smooth roads unfurled across the land.Mr. Mnangagwa, by contrast, will inherit a husk. And unlike the tens of thousands of Zimbabweans who greeted Mr. Mugabe in 1980, their descendants in the streets of Harare on Saturday may well feel that the last thing they want in a post-Mugabe era is for history to repeat itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Technology Ambitions Could Upset the Global Trade Order", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 When President Trump arrives in Beijing on Wednesday, he will most likely complain about traditional areas of dispute like steel and cars. But Washington officials and major global companies increasingly worry about a new generation of deals that could give China a firmer grip on the technology of tomorrow.Sometimes it demands partnerships or intellectual property as the price of admission to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Sometimes it woos foreign giants with money and market access in ways that elude American and global trade rules.When concerned officials in Washington began blocking China\u2019s ability to buy high-end technology last year, one American company found a way to help its Chinese partner around those limits. The company, Advanced Micro Devices, avoided scrutiny by licensing its exclusive microchip designs, rather than selling them.The Chinese partner got access to the technology to make its own products. Advanced Micro Devices got a big payout.The rules of global commerce are changing \u2014 and China and the United States are racing to create a future that aligns with their own distinct visions. The result could be an overhaul of 20th-century trade rules for a 21st-century global economic order, in which money, ideas and influence could become as closely watched and tightly regulated as hard goods packed on a ship and sent abroad.Even before the Communist Revolution, China obsessed about absorbing foreign technology as a way to end a century of humiliation and restore its national strength. But Made in China 2025 is more ambitious than anything the government has ever attempted, a national industrial policy that aims to project a new type of global might and influence.Such efforts have some American government officials and business leaders calling for a rethinking of how the United States approaches trade. Lawmakers are pushing for tougher rules on technology purchases, which do not usually cover the types of deals that China increasingly prefers. Officials are also investigating whether China is stealing intellectual property.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good idea. I think it\u2019s the ultimate short-termism to give up very valuable I.T. in order to get a few quarters or a few years of improved sales.\u201dThe government hopes to change that. It is backing the effort with money: $45 billion in cheap loans for its companies, $3 billion for advanced manufacturing efforts and billions more in other financial support, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German think tank.Made in China 2025 \u201cis going to have substantial resources and focus devoted to it, especially at the local government level,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent venture capitalist in Beijing.The goal is not simply to beat the United States. China is preparing for a day when cheap manufacturing no longer keeps its economy humming. It wants to embrace industries offering skilled jobs that do not blacken its skies and cloud its rivers.The plan itself has specific targets and quotas. By 2025 it envisions China meeting nearly three-quarters of its own demand for industrial robots and more than a third of its demand for smartphone chips. Other targets cover new-energy cars, like electric cars, and high-performance medical devices.\u201cOur partnership with Kuka is actually about whole factory solutions,\u201d said Irene Chen, a spokeswoman for Midea.Where technology cannot be purchased, the government wants Chinese companies to extract it from foreign firms through deals or tough new laws.Cybersecurity laws enacted this summer give the Ministry of State Security the power to conduct security reviews of technology sold or used in China, said James A. Lewis, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Such a step could require companies to expose some of their most valuable secrets.At some companies, Chinese security officials conduct the inspections in corporate \u201cclean rooms\u201d in the United States, with the Chinese officials traveling on business visas, Mr. Lewis said. The companies argue that the access takes place under controlled circumstances that limit what Chinese officials might learn.\u201cIf American companies have a big market in China, they say to the Ministry of State Security, \u2018Come in,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cEveryone fears retaliation. No one wants to lose the China market.\u201dA.M.D.\u2019s joint venture with its Chinese partner can be found in a gleaming industrial area of the city of Chengdu called Tianfu Software Park.The park represents Beijing\u2019s vision of the future. Trees and sidewalks jammed with ride-sharing bikes sit beneath a vast strip of office towers, hotels and apartment complexes. Offices of China\u2019s most innovative companies, like Huawei and Tencent, sit next to outposts of their foreign analogues, like SAP and Accenture.Inside one of its glass towers, A.M.D. works with its Chinese partner, a company called Sugon, to produce new chips.Under the nearly $300 million deal, A.M.D. agreed to license chip technology to a Chinese joint venture with Sugon to make chips for servers. Because A.M.D. controls that joint venture, the technology is considered to remain in American hands.But A.M.D. struck a second partnership that the Chinese company controls. That joint venture works on applications such as integrating the chips with servers. The two ventures are on the 11th and 12th floors of the same building.\u201cWe have worked closely with and been very clear with U.S. government officials on the strategy and specifics of the technology, which is classified as permitted for export,\u201d an A.M.D. spokesman said in an emailed statement. He added that the processors are also lower performing than other options that A.M.D. sells in America.Executives in Chengdu said there was a firewall between the two joint ventures, and the one outside of A.M.D.\u2019s control was not involved in chip development.\u201cWhen they first announced the partnership I was shocked,\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst with Sanford Bernstein.\u201cYou would think intellectual property and joint ventures would belong under Cfius review,\u201d Mr. Rasgon said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign deals. \u201cIt should. It\u2019s surprising it isn\u2019t.\u201dFor some in the Trump administration, an 18-year-old book by two Chinese Air Force colonels has become required reading.Called \u201cUnrestricted Warfare,\u201d the book argues that China does not need to match the United States militarily. Instead China can take advantage of the global economy and the internet to take down its main rival.Some American officials see in it a guide to China\u2019s plan. Some United States lawmakers are proposing to toughen American takeover laws to evaluate deals on an economic as well as a national security basis. They are also pressing for reviews of licensing agreements and joint ventures. The United States trade representative has also launched an investigation into whether Chinese companies are stealing intellectual property.\u201cThere\u2019s concern that U.S. firms are transacting away their competitive advantages,\u201d said Greg Levesque, managing director of Pointe Bello, a research firm in Washington, and a former executive at the US-China Business Council.Such changes could ripple through the tech world. Chinese investment often means more money with fewer strings attached. Some tech companies say that is good for innovation. China\u2019s spending on science and research is also growing at a time when the United States government and others are cutting back.At a recent dinner event in Washington, an American technology executive held up a dinner plate to illustrate the size of the China market, said a person who was there who asked not to be identified because the event was not public. Then the American executive held up a wine coaster that represented the size of his firm\u2019s business.The message was clear: American companies are at risk of being muscled out of the market.\u201cMade in China 2025 seems to reject all notions of comparative advantage and future opportunities for high-value-added manufactured exports from the rest of the world to China,\u201d said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\u201cIf Made in China 2025 achieves its goals,\u201d he said, \u201cthe U.S. and other countries would likely become just commodity exporters to China \u2014 selling oil, gas, beef and soybeans.\u201dJane Perlez reported from Beijing, Paul Mozur from Shanghai, and Jonathan Ansfield from Chengdu, China.

{"Headline": "Yellen Says Economic Expansion Has Gained Strength", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Wednesday that the country\u2019s economic expansion had broadened and strengthened, and that she expected the growth to continue.\u201cEconomic growth appears to have stepped up from its subdued pace early in the year,\u201d she told the Congressional committee. \u201cMoreover, the economic expansion is increasingly broad, based across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.\u201dMs. Yellen was careful to say that the economy could be doing better. She noted that the pace of economic growth remained slow by historical standards. The two major determinants of growth, the number of workers and the productivity of the average worker, are rising slowly.\u201c Congress might consider policies that encourage business investment and capital formation, improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure, raise the quality of our educational system, and support innovation and the adoption of new technologies,\u201d she said.In response to questions from members of both political parties, however, she declined to assess whether the Republican tax plan would achieve that goal. She said that it was up to Congress and the White House to evaluate the details of proposed changes.\u201cLooking at the likely impact of the particular proposals that may be under consideration is something that we haven\u2019t done carefully at the Federal Reserve,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.She also said changes in fiscal policy could affect how quickly the Fed raises rates.Fed officials have drawn a careful distinction between tax cuts that increase economic capacity \u2014 for example, by encouraging business investment \u2014 and tax cuts that provide a short-term sugar high, such as cuts in personal income taxes that would likely increase spending.The Fed estimates that the economy is already growing at something close to the maximum sustainable pace. A short-term stimulus, therefore, would likely raise inflation. In turn, the Fed could seek to offset faster inflation by raising interest rates more quickly.\u201cWe welcome strong growth,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cThe Fed is not trying to stifle growth. We\u2019re worried about trends that could push inflation above our 2 percent objective.\u201dLike Mr. Powell, Ms. Yellen defended stronger regulation of large banks. She said it would be \u201cvery dangerous\u201d to roll back the stringencies introduced after the 2008 crisis.She also reiterated Mr. Powell\u2019s view that the Fed supported legislation that would ease the regulatory burden on smaller banks. She even borrowed a phrase from Mr. Powell, endorsing the idea of \u201ctailoring\u201d regulations to the size of the bank.Ms. Yellen\u2019s assessment of economic conditions was perhaps the most upbeat in her four years as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, reflecting the improvement of economic conditions during her term. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.1 percent, while inflation remains below 2 percent.The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that the American economy expanded at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the third quarter, higher than its previous estimate of 3 percent.\u201cWith ongoing strengthening in labor market conditions and an outlook for inflation to return to 2 percent over the next couple of years, the F.O.M.C. has continued to gradually reduce policy accommodation,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cWe continue to expect that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation.\u201dInflation remains below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent annual target. Indeed, this is likely to be the sixth straight year the Fed falls short of that target. But Ms. Yellen said she expected inflation to rise as the labor market continues to tighten. She noted that businesspeople now uniformly tell the Fed that they are having trouble finding enough qualified workers. That suggests businesses are under pressure to offer high wages, leading to higher prices.Members of the committee took the opportunity to praise Ms. Yellen. Democrats were particularly effusive in applauding her performance at the Fed.\u201cI would say your tenure has been an unqualified success by every metric,\u201d said Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York.She described Ms. Yellen as \u201cone of the most successful Fed chairmen in history.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Myths of the 1 Percent: What Puts People at the Top", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDispelling misconceptions about what\u2019s driving income inequality in the U.S. Before looking into some of what\u2019s behind this, let\u2019s address common misconceptions.Unions are thought to redistribute income from owners to workers, but there is no correlation across countries between the change in labor\u2019s share of G.D.P. since 1980 and an increase in the income share of the top 1 percent. Britain saw an increase in the labor share of G.D.P. but also one of the sharpest increases in inequality. The Netherlands saw a large fall in labor\u2019s share but no rise in inequality.Nationalists attribute rising inequality to mass immigration and the supposedly low skills of immigrants.There is no correlation between changing immigration shares since 1990 and rising top-income shares. In fact, the countries that have absorbed the most immigrants \u2014 on a per-capita basis \u2014 have seen overall income inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) fall.An assumption implicit in this argument is that immigrants drag down earnings at the bottom of the distribution, making inequality worse. If this were an important factor, rising inequality should coincide with large gaps in income between foreign-born and native-born adults. It doesn\u2019t.Almost all of the growth in top American earners has come from just three economic sectors: professional services, finance and insurance, and health care, groups that tend to benefit from regulatory barriers that shelter them from competition.The groups that have contributed the most people to the 1 percent since 1980 are: physicians; executives, managers, sales supervisors, and analysts working in the financial sectors; and professional and legal service industry executives, managers, lawyers, consultants and sales representatives.Without changes in these largely domestic services industries \u2014 finance, health care, the law \u2014 the United States would look like Canada or Germany in terms of its top income shares.The United States also stands out in terms of how much money its elite professionals earn relative to the median worker. Workers at the 90th percentile of the income distribution for professionals make 3.5 times the earnings of the typical (median) worker in all occupations in the United States. Only Mexico and Israel, which have very high inequality, compensate professionals so disproportionately. In Switzerland, the Netherlands, Finland and Denmark, the ratio is about 2 to 1.This ratio, the elite professions premium, is very highly correlated with income inequality across countries.Problems cited by these analysts include subsidies for the financial sector\u2019s risk-taking; overprotection of software and pharmaceutical patents; the escalation of land-use controls that drive up rents in desirable metropolitan areas; favoritism toward market incumbents via state occupational licensing regulations (for example, associations representing lawyers, doctors and dentists that block efforts allowing paraprofessionals to provide routine services at a lower price without their supervision).These are just some of the causes contributing to the 1 percent\u2019s high and rising income share. Reforming relevant laws can make markets more efficient and egalitarian, and in contrast with trade, immigration and technology, the political causes of the 1 percent\u2019s rise are directly under the control of citizens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jet Pilot Might Not Seem Like a \u2018Gig,\u2019 but at Ryanair, It Is", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo contain the crisis, Ryanair might cut a week of vacation from the airline\u2019s 4,200 pilots \u2014 many of whom aren\u2019t full-time employees but independent contractors. If they \u201cmisbehaved\u201d by declining to help, he added, they would get no \u201cgoodies\u201d in the future.It wasn\u2019t the first provocative comment from Mr. O\u2019Leary, a pugnacious leader who transformed Europe\u2019s airline industry with an aggressive cost-cutting approach that extended to the work force.Employees have banded together to demand collective bargaining and more secure contracts, touching off a fresh clash with management. Last week, 59 pilots representing employees across Europe renewed those demands, adding that \u201cpilots have had enough.\u201dRyanair controls its expenses by using a mix of full-time employees and self-employed pilots recruited through outside agencies. It also issues Irish work contracts to cabin crew and senior pilots around Europe, arguing that they work in Irish-registered aircraft and not in the countries where they are based.The company\u2019s practices are also feeding employees\u2019 frustrations. In interviews, more than a dozen current and former pilots and crew members described demanding work conditions and atypical employment arrangements that made it difficult to voice complaints. Most agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, citing nondisclosure agreements in Ryanair contracts and concerns about jeopardizing their jobs.The president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association expressed support for Ryanair pilots.Ryanair has vowed not to meet with or recognize any union. Its concern is that rivals are capitalizing on the flight cancellation episode to organize Ryanair\u2019s pilots and crew members \u2014 a move that analysts say would hurt the company\u2019s advantage in low labor costs.Mr. O\u2019Leary declined requests for an interview. But in letters and public statements, he repeatedly blamed airline unions and competitors, saying they tried to \u201cdemean and disparage our collective success,\u201d a charge he has renewed in recent weeks.Brookfield handed Mr. Van Boekel, who was based in Belgium, a list of Irish accounting firms and told him to choose one, according to a 2013 lawsuit that Brookfield brought against Mr. Van Boekel when he resigned to work at another carrier. The accountants made him a shareholder and director of a Dublin-based \u201cservice company\u201d called Winged Foot Ltd. Brookfield then arranged for the company to supply Mr. Van Boekel\u2019s piloting services to Ryanair, the suit said.The labor setup is key to an elaborate cost-cutting strategy that Mr. O\u2019Leary pioneered in the mid-1990s, when the European air travel market was liberalized. Until then, big national carriers like Alitalia, Air France and Lufthansa had commanded the Continent, with a corps of unionized pilots.Mr. O\u2019Leary followed the low-cost model of Southwest Airlines in Dallas, now the world\u2019s biggest airline in terms of passengers. Southwest had minimized operating costs and lured fliers from legacy carriers by offering cheap, bare-bones flights.He honed the approach for Ryanair, putting hubs in inexpensive European locales that generated new tourism and jobs. Fuel costs were rigorously managed, and turnaround times for flights squeezed to the fastest in the industry. The company uses only Boeing jets to reduce engineering costs, and leases part of its fleet to recoup tax write-offs. And it avoided unionization, a strategy that some low-cost European rivals have copied, along with Ryanair\u2019s tactic of using contract pilots to cut costs.The chief executive of the biggest budget airline is Europe issued an impassioned plea to pilots, who are demanding more secure contracts.Ryanair is also a fast-track opportunity for young pilots and crew members to accumulate experience and jump to another airline. Those promoted to captain can earn a six-figure salary on a full-time contract.But employees were often blindsided by the labor setup once they were inside, according to the current and former Ryanair pilots and crew members.Thousands of new Ryanair pilots went through the same process as Mr. Van Boekel. Some were required to form limited liability companies in several countries with pilots they didn\u2019t know.As contractors, they didn\u2019t receive standard benefits for pensions or health insurance. Pilots and flight attendants on Ryanair\u2019s Irish contracts weren\u2019t always protected by labor laws in the countries where they worked. Ryanair said its contracts complied with labor laws in Ireland and the European Union.Pay has been another concern. Self-employed pilots and aircrew members are paid only for hours flown, but not for time spent preparing for a flight, or when they are delayed or canceled. Minimum monthly work hours were promised though not guaranteed.Contractor pilots paid their own transportation and costly hotel bills when assigned to fly from different airports. Like flight crews, they said they shelled out for uniforms, food and even drinking water on flights. Ryanair said that staff members received allowances to defray the costs of uniforms and other expenses. The company\u2019s go-to employment agencies required job seekers to pay for qualification training, starting at around \u20ac2,500 for flight attendants and about \u20ac30,000 for pilots.Pilots, in interviews, said they felt discouraged from raising workplace concerns, which could lead to being called into Dublin for tense meetings with managers. Others recounted being pressured to limit their fuel consumption and fearful of being reprimanded if they complained of fatigue. Flight attendants reported coming to work ill and scrambling to fulfill sales quotas on flights for lottery cards, perfumes and other items to avoid rebuke by managers. Ryanair said it did not limit fuel consumption and that its aircraft take off with fuel exceeding E.U. safety guidelines. The company disputed reprimanding staff for complaining of fatigue or illness.One former pilot recalled protesting after being told to pay for a costly taxi ride to another airport to fill in for a colleague. Managers suggested he could be demoted if he didn\u2019t comply. It created a culture of fear, he said.Robin Kiely, Ryanair\u2019s spokesman, said that claims of workplace pressures were \u201cfalse and invented,\u201d fomented by unions seeking to undermine Ryanair. \u201cThere is no pressure on people here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly work hard, but we work smart.\u201dMr. Kiely said employees enjoyed favorable conditions and unmatched job security. \u201cWe have 13,000 employees,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was so bad, they wouldn\u2019t be working here.\u201dRyanair employees have made various attempts to unionize. Each time, the effort has been rebuffed.James Atkinson, a pilot who flew with Ryanair for eight years, said that when he started in Rome in 2006, the company pressured crew members who tried to organize.People who participated in those organizing efforts were reassigned to other airports outside of Italy where Ryanair operates. Those who refused to relocate were fired; others eventually retracted their demands, he said.Later, Mr. Atkinson created his own website to try to organize Ryanair employees. Soon after, he said, Brookfield declined to renew his contract. \u201cI was pushing for organization and my contract was terminated,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said. Ryanair said he was dismissed for \u201cmisconduct,\u201d although it would not specify what that was. Today he is a pilot at a rapidly expanding airline in China.In 2011, Belgium-based Ryanair flight attendants on Irish contracts sued for the right to claim Belgian pay and entitlements in the nation\u2019s courts. Ryanair had claimed that disputes involving Irish contracts could be heard only in Ireland, where benefits like unemployment insurance and social security were less favorable than in Belgium.One attendant, Virginie Mauguit, who had been with the carrier for over two years, approached a local union for advice. She distributed union leaflets to crew members describing their rights under Belgian labor law. Two weeks later, Ms. Mauguit received notice that she was fired for previously missing work days, she said.\u201cPeople don\u2019t have the right to complain,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was dangerous for your job.\u201dMr. O\u2019Leary declared victory because the court didn\u2019t bar Ryanair from continuing to issue Irish contracts. But in his letter to employees, he said Ryanair might close gaps in benefits between Irish contracts and local labor laws.The autumn scheduling breakdown brought the issue to the forefront again, hitting not only morale but also the corporate suite.Staff members at Ryanair have continued to fight back, calling on Mr. O\u2019Leary to change the contractor model and improve working conditions. Growing numbers are pressing Ryanair to conduct collective bargaining and recognize a Europe-wide management committee that they organized, rather than negotiate through managers at each Ryanair site. Ryanair maintains that it will only recognize management committees at each of its bases.Pilots in London and in Madrid recently revolted against an offer for pay increases on the condition that they agree to continue negotiating with Ryanair directly. Many are now trying to spread the message more widely via WhatsApp and Facebook.\u201cPilots have said enough is enough: we like this company but we don\u2019t accept the terms and conditions any more,\u201d said Dirk Polloczek, president of the European Cockpit Association, representing more than 38,000 pilots across Europe.\u201cThey think Ryanair can be a good employer,\u201d he added. \u201cAll they have to do is have a dialogue with their pilots.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Walmart Buys Online Retailers, Their Health Benefits Suffer", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe steady growth of e-commerce has been a source of jobs and benefits as employment in traditional stores declines. But at online retailers taken over by Walmart, workers are finding one benefit in retreat: their company-sponsored health coverage.In little more than a year, Walmart has spent nearly $4 billion acquiring e-commerce companies with thousands of workers. Last month, many learned that their potential out-of-pocket costs for medical expenses would increase in 2018 at a rate far exceeding the overall rise in health care costs \u2014 reaching thousands of dollars in many cases.Walmart says the share of its employees eligible for company-sponsored coverage, and of those choosing it, is slightly above the industry norm. But the health benefits it offers in its online operations appear to be inferior to those of many e-commerce competitors.Some of the biggest changes appear to be occurring at another recent acquisition, ModCloth, an online retailer that made its name selling hip, vintage-inspired apparel to millennial women. To keep biweekly premiums for ModCloth\u2019s roughly 300 workers relatively close to what they pay now, their deductibles will rise from nothing to several thousand dollars per year.Some economists say that as Walmart amasses such properties, its practices could put pressure on benefits throughout the e-commerce sector, which had been a relative bright spot for low-wage workers.\u201cMy concern is they bring their model with them regardless of what was going on before they got there,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who served as chief economic adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Blake Jackson, a Walmart spokesman, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve put a lot of thought into creating a total package, including both compensation and benefits, that offers more than what we\u2019ve had in the past.\u201dMr. Jackson pointed out that as new employees of the retail giant, many of the workers had gained benefits like a 401(k) retirement plan with a company match and a stock purchase plan.Mr. Jackson said that the company would make sure its benefits largely kept up with those of competitors, and that the benefits that Walmart offered hourly e-commerce workers were essentially the same benefits it offered hourly workers in its traditional stores.The new Walmart options for hourly workers prominently feature what are known as consumer-driven plans, in which workers cover all their medical expenses out of pocket, up to a relatively high deductible. A medical-expense account to which the company contributes money helps defray these costs.One coverage option for a worker and a child, including dental and vision, has a biweekly premium of about $67 (assuming no use of tobacco products). Walmart would in turn contribute $600 to a health reimbursement account. Once that $600 is exhausted, however, the worker would have to shoulder the full amount of family medical expenses up to $5,500.At companies with 200 or more workers, only 10 percent of those enrolled in such plans face deductibles of $5,000 or higher for family coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s 2017 survey.Larry Levitt, a health insurance expert at the foundation, said that such high-deductible plans had increasingly become the cost-containment strategy of choice among many employers, but that the particulars of Walmart\u2019s plan made it especially ungenerous.At Walmart\u2019s archrival, Amazon, workers typically pay less for more coverage. A similar type of plan would cost an Amazon worker with a child about $60 in biweekly premiums, with Amazon contributing $1,000 into a reimbursement account, according to the company. (The plan includes dental and vision coverage.) After exhausting that account, the worker would pay all expenses out of pocket up to $3,000.If a ModCloth worker with a child wanted to lower the annual deductible to $3,500 \u2014 the lowest the company offers for this type of plan \u2014 and receive a $1,000 company contribution, the biweekly premium would be about $136, or just under $2,000 more per year than the Amazon plan.ModCloth workers were also given the option of sticking with a more conventional insurance plan, but those who do will face premiums that are roughly double their old premiums for family coverage, and their deductible will rise from nothing to $2,000.The average full-time hourly wage at ModCloth is $13.64. (Walmart put the average wage for its full-time store employees at $13.85 per hour.) But ModCloth employees say Susan Gregg Koger and Eric Koger, who started the company when they arrived in Pittsburgh to attend college in 2002 and later married, saw generous health insurance benefits as central to their feminist values. (Ms. Koger declined to comment.)\u201cThe health benefits were really, really good,\u201d said Alicia Faust Ogg, who worked in returns and customer service at ModCloth between 2012 and 2014.Ms. Ogg, who had a baby while at the company, said that she had paid nothing out of pocket for her prenatal visits and that her hospital bill for the delivery had been below $1,000.Under ModCloth\u2019s current insurance, workers pay biweekly premiums ranging from $6.65 for the employee alone to $144 to cover a spouse and children as well. They pay no deductible within the company\u2019s network and a modest co-payment for most doctor visits.But in a tough retail environment, online operations were under pressure even before Walmart\u2019s buying spree.In 2014, ModCloth imposed the first of several rounds of layoffs and, according to several current and former employees, gradually made its perks less generous. That included cutbacks in health coverage, they said, but it remained comprehensive and affordable before the company was sold.Reed Abelson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Competition Is Ruining Childhood. The Kids Should Fight Back.", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn CampusLike the crack of a starting pistol, November begins the official college application season. But for students, this race started long ago.Many of today\u2019s kids have lived their entire lives, from sunup until midnight, in a fierce tournament with their peers. (I was one of them. A decade after graduation, I still can\u2019t think of a period when I\u2019ve worked harder than in high school.) From kindergarten to 12th grade, schools brag about how \u201ccompetitive\u201d they are. That means it\u2019s not enough for students to do their best. Whether in the classroom, on the athletic field or at home on the computer, they must always be better. Youth has become a debilitating endurance test.The thing is, we don\u2019t even really know what we are racing for, much less how to tone down the competition. And most people don\u2019t seem to be benefiting from this frantic contest, either as students or as adult workers. Americans are improving themselves, but the rewards keep flowing uphill to the 1 percent.Everyone tells students that the harder they work to develop their job skills \u2014 their \u201chuman capital\u201d \u2014 the better off they will be. It\u2019s not true. In fact, the result is the opposite: more and better educated workers, earning less.Despite what we\u2019ve heard, money isn\u2019t a reward America hands out for hard work. Not only is more education not leading to higher wages, there isn\u2019t even a positive correlation between the two. If anything, the flood of human capital puts employers in a position to offer workers a shrinking slice of the pie and get more in return. Kids are getting conned. I got conned, too.As training left the factory and the office for the classroom, it also meant that work could be shifted to children, who are mostly not eligible for wage labor but can, it turns out, do a whole lot of school. If firms want workers who can speak Mandarin or code Python, why should they pay trainees to learn when they can scare kids into training themselves? Within this system, all an individual kid can do is try to put a sufficient number of their peers between themselves and poverty.There are some winners, but the real champions are the corporate owners: They get their pick from all the qualified applicants, and the oversupply of human capital keeps labor costs down. Competition between workers means lower wages for them and higher profits for their bosses: The more teenagers who learn to code, the cheaper one is.At the end of their journey into adulthood they aren\u2019t reimbursed for their efforts. And in this winner-take-all economy, most of them just lose. They can\u2019t increase the size of Harvard\u2019s freshman class just by working harder; all they can do is drive one another to anxiety, depression, paranoia and exhaustion. That, and save money for their future bosses.It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. The kids don\u2019t have to keep getting conned.This system may work for a small number of bosses and shareholders, but it\u2019s not in the interest of education in a broad, exploratory sense \u2014 and it\u2019s clearly not in the interests of young people themselves. But even though older adults are ostensibly worried about the kids, policymakers will never scale back academic competition, and most educators and parents are understandably loath to tell children, \u201cDon\u2019t work so hard.\u201dIf change is going to come, it should come from students, in the classroom.As individuals, students have no choice but to compete. But together, there\u2019s no telling what kind of power they could exercise. They face an age-old collective action problem, but they are smart. Schools can\u2019t run without students, and the economy can\u2019t run without schools; their work matters, and they can withdraw it.Unions aren\u2019t just good for wage workers. Students can use collective bargaining, too. The idea of organizing student labor when even auto factory workers are having trouble holding onto their unions may sound outlandish, but young people have been at the forefront of conflicts over police brutality, immigrant rights and sexual violence. In terms of politics, they are as tightly clustered as just about any demographic in America. They are an important social force in this country, one we need right now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After House Vote on Taxes, Spotlight Shifts to Undecided Senators", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The fast-moving Republican effort to overhaul the tax code now rests in the hands of a small number of fence-sitting senators with disparate concerns, like how small businesses are taxed and whether health insurance costs will spike after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement to have coverage or pay a penalty.Lawmakers face a challenge in navigating those competing priorities without rankling other members or running afoul of budget rules. For instance, dropping the repeal of the individual mandate from the bill would mollify the concerns of some but could alienate others who wish to see it included, while also upending the delicate fiscal math behind the Republican plan.Mr. Flake, an unapologetic Trump critic, seemed unmoved by the declaration. \u201cWhat the president says or does or feels has nothing whatsoever to do with how I will vote on that tax bill,\u201d Mr. Flake said during a radio interview on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s just not how I operate.\u201dSenator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, wants the full Senate to consider the tax bill next week. Because Republicans hold a narrow 52-to-48 majority, party leaders can afford only two defections, assuming Democrats are unified against the bill and Vice President Mike Pence provides the tiebreaking vote. The math would grow even tighter if Democrats gain a seat in the special election for Senate in Alabama next month.The concerns expressed by Republican senators are hardly monolithic, and Mr. McConnell will have to walk a delicate line to resolve the issues without setting off additional objections from other lawmakers.The deficit issue is a crucial one, given several senators have already expressed concerns about piling up more debt as a result of the tax overhaul. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee has said he will not vote for a tax plan that he determines will add to the deficit, after accounting for economic growth spurred by the legislation. Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma has also expressed deficit concerns.Mr. Flake, who has spoken positively in recent days about the effort to overhaul the tax code, repeated his deficit concerns on Monday.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to realize we have a $20 trillion debt and a deficit that\u2019s about $600 billion a year, and we can\u2019t do things that are simply going to explode that deficit,\u201d Mr. Flake said on KFYI, an Arizona radio station.\u201cI think we desperately need tax reform,\u201d Mr. Flake said. \u201cIt\u2019s been more than 30 years since we\u2019ve had significant tax reform. My concern is that it\u2019s really tax reform and not just tax cuts.\u201dAnother matter under scrutiny is how the Senate bill treats small businesses and other so-called pass-through entities, whose owners pay taxes on profits through the individual tax code.\u201cThat\u2019s not the best way to pass something that\u2019s going to affect so many people\u2019s lives and have such a dramatic impact on our economy,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.Then there is the contentious issue of health care, which Senate Republicans brought into the already difficult tax debate when they added to their bill the repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that most people have health coverage or pay a penalty. The Senate proposal would eliminate those penalties, effectively scrapping the coverage requirement, known as the individual mandate.The inclusion of the repeal immediately raised questions about how such a provision might influence the votes of the Republican senators who objected to previous efforts this year to repeal the Affordable Care Act, particularly Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.This time, Ms. Murkowski has a big reason to support the tax overhaul: The legislation is to be combined with a measure to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling, a goal she has championed.\u201cIf you do pull this piece of the Affordable Care Act out, for some middle-income families, the increased premium is going to cancel out the tax cut that they would get,\u201d Ms. Collins said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday.Beyond the issue of health care, for instance, she wants to keep the current top tax rate, 39.6 percent, for people making $1 million or more, rather than lower it to 38.5 percent as the Senate bill would do.But now that the repeal of the individual mandate has been added to the bill, taking it out to pacify someone like Ms. Collins would create its own problems. Getting rid of the mandate is projected to save the government more than $300 billion over a decade, and Senate Republicans are counting on those savings to offset some of the cost of their tax cuts.Still, the president\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said on Sunday that the administration would be open to dropping the repeal of the individual mandate from the tax overhaul if necessary.\u201cIf we can repeal part of Obamacare as part of a tax bill, and have a tax bill that is still a good tax bill that can pass, that\u2019s great,\u201d he said on CNN. \u201cIf it becomes an impediment to getting the best tax bill we can, then we\u2019re O.K. with taking it out.\u201dAt the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump expressed optimism about the tax effort, congratulating the House for passing its bill last week and expressing hope that the Senate would soon follow suit.\u201cWe\u2019re going to give the American people a huge tax cut for Christmas,\u201d the president said. \u201cHopefully that will be a great, big, beautiful Christmas present.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia Says It Will Ease Debt Burden on Venezuela", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith Venezuela on the edge of default, Russia has thrown it a life preserver.The Russian finance minister, Anton Siluanov, announced on Wednesday that the two countries had agreed to the restructuring of roughly $3 billion in Kremlin loans.The amount is tiny compared with Venezuela\u2019s crushing $120 billion debt, but it may help President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government make hundreds of millions of dollars in payments over the next few weeks to other creditors and help reassure bondholders that a default is not imminent.It has been a scramble for Venezuela to make a $1.2 billion payment on a national oil company bond due last Friday, mostly principal, which had no grace period. Early Wednesday, investors and financial analysts were beginning to fear that Venezuela would not come up with the money it had promised to pay.By midday, overdue transfers to bondholders began. Still, over the last month Venezuela has delayed payment of more than $350 million in interest on various bonds, with grace periods ending over the next few weeks.\u201cClearly the Venezuelans have been looking for relief anywhere they can get it, and at this point Russia is their most viable source of financing,\u201d said Risa Grais-Targow, director for Latin America at Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis firm. \u201cThe Venezuelans have been pushing very hard on the Russians.\u201dOver the past three years, Russia has provided Caracas with $10 billion in financial assistance, and last year Rosneft took a 49.9 percent stake in Citgo, the Venezuelan state oil company\u2019s refining subsidiary in the United States. That represented collateral for a $1.5 billion loan to the parent company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa. Rosneft is negotiating to swap the interest in Citgo for oil fields in Venezuela.Rosneft\u2019s investments have also been focused on Cuba, China, Egypt and Vietnam, and it has been seeking deals around the eastern Mediterranean and Africa, areas where it contends with American interests. Using its oil company as a geopolitical tool has given Russia more running room at a time when Western sanctions weigh heavily on its economy.The terms of the restructuring were not made public on Wednesday, and neither were details of the original loan. Ms. Grais-Targow said the Russian loan might go back several years, to a time when former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who died of cancer in 2013, bought Russian armaments.Since Venezuela customarily pays Russia back with oil, the renegotiation could mean that Venezuela will have more oil to sell on world markets for badly needed cash to make debt payments as well as import food and medicines that are in short supply.Stuart Culverhouse, head of sovereign and fixed-income research at Exotix Capital, an emerging-markets investment bank and broker that trades Venezuelan bonds, described the renegotiation as \u201cRussia trying to be reasonably friendly to prevent something worse.\u201dWashington\u2019s sanctions prohibit Americans from dealing with the man in charge of the renegotiation, Vice President Tareck El Aissam\u00ed, whom American officials have linked to drug trafficking. Sanctions put in place in August also restrict trading of Venezuelan bonds sold by the government in American financial markets.But the call for negotiations also makes an outright Venezuelan declaration of nonpayment of loans more unlikely, so a default would have to be declared by major bondholders themselves.For a default to occur, holders of 25 percent of the value of the bonds would first have to raise the issue with trustees or fiscal agents listed on the bonds. If the government does not satisfy the trustee or agent that it is prepared to make good on the obligations, the creditors can then seek a resolution in court.Mr. Culverhouse said he did not think that bondholders, a diverse group of Venezuelan and international individuals and financial institutions, would move precipitously.\u201cI don\u2019t think a majority would want to accelerate things and declare a default right now,\u201d he said, \u201cThey would want to see what the government\u2019s reaction would be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Edwidge Danticat: Dawn After the Tempests", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe people sitting on either side of me on the plane were not tourism experts either. They were tourists, two young American couples on their honeymoons. After listening to them exchange wedding stories, I turned to the poet and essayist Audre Lorde\u2019s \u201cGrenada Revisited: An Interim Report,\u201d an essay she wrote a few weeks after the 1983 United States\u2019 invasion of her parents\u2019 homeland.I had read Lorde\u2019s essay many times before \u2014 it\u2019s the last chapter of her seminal 1984 collection \u201cSister Outsider\u201d\u2014 but I wanted to read it again before seeing Grenada for the first time.That we landed at Maurice Bishop International Airport, which is named after the former Prime Minister of Grenada who was assassinated six days before the start of the U.S. invasion, might have intrigued Lorde. I felt her begin this journey with me as I walked down the airplane steps, the sun that is only this sparkling bright in the Caribbean, beaming down on my face.\u201cThe first time I came to Grenada I came seeking \u2018home,\u2019\u201d began Lorde\u2019s essay of her 1978 visit. She had flown into the now closed Pearl\u2019s Airport in Grenville on the northeastern coast of the island. Back then, there was one paved road, she reported. Now, there are many smooth and winding ones through lively neighborhoods as well as tree-covered hills.Among Lorde\u2019s most striking recollections was seeing Grand Anse Beach, not the hotel-lined miles of white sand that attract both locals and tourists, but the busy thoroughfare that runs alongside it.She saw: \u201cChildren in proper school uniforms carrying shoes, trying to decide between the lure of a coco palm adventure to one side and the delicious morning sea on the other.\u201dI, too, saw children, dozens of them on either side of the street one morning. Most of the children wore traditional uniforms, white shirts and blouses and plaid skirts or dark or khaki shorts or pants. They huddled together chatting and giggling, not paying attention to the dark blue sea on one side or the colorfully painted houses and buildings in the hills on the other. These children reminded me of children you would see heading to school in my native Haiti, or most other Caribbean islands, their range of black and brown skin glistening in the sun. The older ones kept their younger siblings at their side, even as they climbed into public transportation minivans and buses.I went in search of more of those \u201cvivid images\u201d in Lorde\u2019s essay and, besides the school children at Grand Anse Beach, there was Fat Woman-Who-Fries-Fish-In-The-Market. I did not see her inside the turquoise-and-white square building downtown. She was not standing near the massive fish laid out on slabs waiting to be gutted. Nor was she by the smaller ones piled into buckets out front.The fish market smelled predictably like the sea. The buzz of the customer and buyer exchanges was a lot more subdued than I expected. Not all the vendors had customers. The market\u2019s relative calm on a Friday afternoon reminded me how small Grenada is. The island is 120 square miles and has about 100,000 residents.Not all the graduates always travel to the Open Campus ceremonies, my hosts from the University of the West Indies told me. However, this year there were students who wanted to come to their graduation in Grenada but could not. Most of the graduates travel from other countries for the Open Campus ceremony, which takes place in a different location each year. Many had homes that were damaged or destroyed. Some lost loved ones along with everything they owned.I was told the story of one graduate from Trinidad who stayed home because she had donated her plane ticket money to relief efforts in Dominica, which has U.W.I.\u2019s most devastated campus. Some of the students from that campus are still unaccounted for.Hurricane Maria struck Dominica, the southernmost of the Leeward Islands as a Category 5 storm on Sept. 18. Dominica\u2019s Prime Minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, whose own roof collapsed during the storm, later told CNN: \u201cOur agriculture sector is 100 percent destroyed. Our tourism is, I would say, about 95 percent destroyed.\u201dI have never been to Dominica but now I wish I had. This is not just born out of a desire to see a place \u201cbefore.\u201d Before the devastation, before the storm. I am from a place, Haiti, that constantly evokes nostalgia in the people who have seen it, lived in it, and loved it \u201cbefore.\u201dThis longing for before always saddens me because it makes the present seem even worse. But I still wish I had seen Dominica before, in part because it is the birthplace of one of my favorite novelists, Jean Rhys. The places that Antoinette, Rhys\u2019 doomed narrator in \u201cWide Sargasso Sea,\u201d longs for have flaming sunsets and rivers so clear that you can see the pebbles at the bottom. They have moss-covered gardens filled with orchids, hibiscus and flamboyants, which are illuminated at night by fireflies.This is one of the ways I have imagined Dominica, along with what I have seen in travel guides: its high mountain peaks, forts, lush rain forests, reefs, gorges, lakes and water falls.Dominica is also home to Xuela Claudette Richardson, the narrator of Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s novel \u201cThe Autobiography of My Mother.\u201d At 15, Xuela was taken by her father to Roseau, the capital of Dominica. Roseau, Xuela finds \u2014 like a lot of places in the Caribbean \u2014 \u201chad a fragile foundation, and from time to time was destroyed by forces of nature, a hurricane or water coming from the sky as if suddenly the sea were above and the heavens below.\u201dLorde\u2019s second visit was in late 1983, after then U.S. president Ronald Reagan had deployed Marines to the island. Reagan declared that he wanted to prevent a \u201cSoviet-Cuban\u201d colony from taking root in Grenada and protect American citizens on the island, many of whom were students at St. George\u2019s University School of Medicine.I visited St. George\u2019s University, whose students and officials, Lorde pointed out, later denied that they were ever in danger. The school, which is no longer just a medical school, but also covers other disciplines, is an island unto itself, with its many salmon-colored buildings, massive water tanks, security personnel and buses. All over the campus are breathtaking views of True Blue Bay, the point where the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean meet.If Reagan was so interested in seeing democracy flourish in the Caribbean, Lorde wondered, why did the U.S. government support Haiti\u2019s Jean-Claude Duvalier and his repressive regime? She also mentioned Puerto Rico.In 1897, she wrote, \u201cU.S. Marines landed in Puerto Rico to fight the Spanish-American War. They never left.\u201dPuerto Rico was as devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria as Dominica, Barbuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands. I have not been to Puerto Rico either. I have only visited it in books, particularly through the eyes of young Esmeralda Santiago in her memoir, \u201cWhen I Was Puerto Rican.\u201dI imagined the guavas that she taught me and other readers to eat at the beginning of her book being no longer able to grow, the fields they came from deep in the countryside flattened, and the families that farmed them struggling to stay alive without food or clean water.\u201cThere is nothing that unites people more anywhere in the world than injustice,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWe have to get food, we have to get water or else we are being condemned to a slow death. It may be easy to try to disregard us. It may be easy because we are a U.S. territory and a colony of the United States. But we\u2019re a people, damn it.\u201dThe blessings of our islands are also our curse. Our geography gives us year-round sun and beautiful beaches, but more and more in the age of climate change, we are on the front line of destruction.\u201cWe are a people\u201d seems to be what we have been saying for generations to all our colonizers and invaders who seemed intent on destroying us. And now more than ever, Mother Nature, too.We are a people, the Arawaks and Ta\u00ednos might have said, even as they died trying to prove it. We have even inherited the word for hurricane, hurac\u00e1n, from them.\u201cMuch has been terribly lost in Grenada,\u201d Lorde wrote at the end of her 1983 visit, \u201cbut not all \u2014 not the spirit of the people.\u201dthat the lightning startles the tree \u2026\u201dThe people of the Caribbean speak, the poet wrote, because we \u201cwere not bornto be your vassals.\u201d________________________Edwidge Danticat\u2019s latest book is \u201cThe Art of Death: Writing the Final Story.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s \u2018Renaissance\u2019 to Gains for Renewables: Global Energy Trends", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 From the rise of renewable power to the transformation of the United States into a heavyweight producer of oil and gas, the global energy market, normally slow to evolve, is going through major upheaval.That is the assessment of Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, the organization based in Paris that is publishing its annual World Energy Outlook on Tuesday.The report does not make for easy bedtime reading: It is 763 pages long and stuffed with data-laden charts and tables.Still, the document tries to project current trends as far out as 2040, and sees an industry at the nexus of various powerful trends.The United States, for instance, has shifted from being an energy-dependent importer to a new role as one of the world\u2019s biggest producers of oil and gas, the report says. But concerns about greenhouse-gas emissions have clouded the future of fossil fuels. That has encouraged the development of alternatives like solar and wind power, which increasingly compete with traditional energy sources.Here are some of the most important themes to be found in the report.Energy production in the United States will continue to shake up the global oil and natural gas markets, and benefit the country\u2019s economy.By the 2030s, largely because of production from shale-rock formations, the United States is expected to produce more than 30 million barrels of oil and gas a day, the report says. That is 50 percent more than any other country has ever produced in a single year.That is a sharp shift from the country\u2019s position just a decade ago, when it was a major importer of oil.The shale industry has gone through a \u201ctrial by fire\u201d in recent years, the report says, referring to a sharp falloff in the price of oil from more than $100 a barrel to as low as around $30 a barrel. It is now above $60 a barrel.Changes in how gas is transported and traded are having a major effect, on the energy industry and the environment.As the United States increases its gas production \u2014 it is now on track to surpass traditional giants like Qatar and Russia and become the world\u2019s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G. \u2014 it is also exporting what the report calls a disruptive \u201cmind-set about how gas markets should operate.\u201dIndustrial emissions of greenhouse gases will likely rise in 2017 after a three-year plateau. It\u2019s a sign that the world is still far from achieving its goals to limit global warming.Gas has historically been sold through long-term contracts pegged to oil prices. That has particularly been the case in Asia, the key market for L.N.G., which is expected to eventually dominate the international gas trade.But as the United States becomes a bigger force in gas markets, it is also helping to break down the existing system. Over time, the report forecasts that gas will be traded more widely and freely, potentially pushing down prices and making it more attractive to developing countries like India and China.There is still work to be done, the report says. The gas industry needs to address emissions of methane that undermine that type of fuel\u2019s environmental claims. \u201cNatural gas is a viable exit ramp off of fossil fuels only if it cleans up its methane pollution, which now seriously undercuts its claimed climate advantages,\u201d said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, an American environmental group.One factor that may hamper the growth of gas: rapidly falling costs of renewable sources of energy like wind and solar installations.The average cost of electricity generated over the life of a solar power plant declined by a stunning 70 percent from 2010 to 2016, according to the agency\u2019s report. Wind costs declined by 25 percent in that period.The report forecasts that these technologies will only become less expensive over the next 25 years, squeezing fossil fuels, which are widely used to generate electric power.Already, power from new wind installations in India and China is cheaper than new gas-fired power plants. A similar situation is developing with solar power, the report says.Still, fossil fuels will not vanish anytime soon. It is much more difficult to reduce the use of coal, gas and oil in sectors like transportation and industry than it is in power generation, and the share of fossil fuels used to meet overall energy demand will be 75 percent in 2040, compared with 81 percent last year, according to the agency\u2019s main scenario.And, the report adds, greenhouse gas levels still appear to be climbing above the threshold required to meet international goals like those established in the 2015 Paris climate accords.Because of China\u2019s scale as a consumer of energy, the choices that the country makes will be felt globally, the report says.China could overtake the United States as the world\u2019s largest consumer of oil as soon as 2030. Of all the new solar and wind power installations to be added through 2040, a third could be in China. In that period, the country could also end up with 320 million electric vehicles, more than a third of the global total.\u201cChina\u2019s choices,\u201d the report says, \u201cwill play a huge role in determining global trends, and could spark a faster clean energy transition.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After \u2018Mad Men,\u2019 Matthew Weiner Turns to a Novel of Madmen", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.If television shows really have replaced the novel as the preferred mirror for our busy lives, then Matthew Weiner is surely one reason. As the creator of \u201cMad Men\u201d and a major contributor to \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d Weiner has done as much as anyone to prove that TV drama can be as emotionally rich and formally artful as any first-rate novel, while at the same time offering all the senses-saturating enchantment of great cinema. The combination is powerful enough to have put just about every novelist I know into a state of at least mild crisis. How can we possibly compete?It comes as a surprise, then, that Weiner has turned to the form he\u2019s helped speed toward redundancy, for his latest project, \u201cHeather, the Totality.\u201d Of course, with his gift for the steady disclosure of complicated characters and his keen ear for the subtexts of human interactions, he ought to be a natural. Still, it\u2019s an interestingly counterintuitive move.It\u2019s a brisk, undemanding read, with alternating sections on the family (rich, tame) and the Worker (poor, psychopathic) creating an efficient mechanism of suspense. The cogs don\u2019t actually mesh until over halfway through, which is a little late, but the question of who is going to do what to whom keeps you queasily engaged, especially after the Worker modifies his plan of rape and murder in favor of something more florid.And yet, it has to be said, the book also seems seriously at odds with itself, in all kinds of ways. Its extreme brevity (a mere 138 pages) suggests an ambition to join the company of those swift, spare thrillers that deploy a diagrammatic precision and economy of detail to uncannily powerful effect (Josephine Hart\u2019s \u201cDamage\u201d and Tim Krabb\u00e9\u2019s \u201cThe Vanishing\u201d come to mind). But a countervailing expansiveness \u2014 whereby Weiner crams a full chronicle of the 15-plus years of Mark and Karen Breakstone\u2019s marital ups and downs, career fluctuations and childhood memories into the book\u2019s tight confines \u2014 works against that minimizing impulse. The result is a strange mixture of curtness and bagginess, with far more information about Mark and Karen\u2019s unremarkable lives than the story needs, delivered in far denser chunks than the reader can digest with any pleasure. Here\u2019s a typical passage:\u201cHis Father found him lacking in aggression and eventually gave up bullying him, finding him best suited for supporting the real warriors, like a girl. Mark did eventually show some athletic ability in cross-country running, which required psychological discipline but was solitary and dismissive of the teamwork his Father thought most valuable. By junior year Mark knew that he preferred to be quietly competitive and that he didn\u2019t get along with men because he hated the anonymous place they assigned him when they were in groups.\u201dDespite this expository abundance, the characters remain oddly vague. Mark (whose corporate job is never fully described, making it hard to care deeply about his shifting financial fortunes) comes across as a dull milquetoast one minute, a conniving manipulator the next. Karen veers between snooty poise and mousy social neurosis. Heather, the daughter, is distinguished by a precocious empathy that prompts her, aged 5, to tell a woman (or rather a Woman) on the subway: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be sad even if your bags are heavy. I can carry one.\u201d But Weiner seems undecided whether to present this as a sympathetic trait (it\u2019s part of what draws Bobby, the Worker, to her) or an obnoxious one (which is how it actually reads), and so in between assuring us of the girl\u2019s miraculous radiance, he sends out what appear to be winking invitations to laugh at her. All three are strikingly bland, even in the middle-school pettiness of their preoccupations with looks, possessions and status. Bobby is more vivid, with some gruesome accomplishments in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but even he remains a generic figure, built from familiar components (poverty, drugs, abuse) all handled with a conspicuous lack of nuance and zero attempt at imaginative sympathy with the world he comes from: \u201cHaving Bobby did little to alter his Mother\u2019s belief that heroin was the best thing in her life.\u201d Why Weiner should have wanted to devote time to such a depleted, rudimentary collection of human beings is a mystery. This is the creator of Don Draper!None of it is helped by what seems a studied disregard for the one useful, if hoary, piece of received wisdom about fiction writing, that it is generally better to show than tell. There\u2019s almost no showing in the entire book; little real-time action or direct speech. You keep waiting for a fully imagined scene with the kind of immersive detail that persuades you of the reality (to borrow Nabokov\u2019s phrase) of what is going on. But even on the rare occasions when one arrives, or seems to, it quickly switches gear into a synopsis-like reporting of things: \u201cOne night, after a very expensive bottle of wine, while they lay spent in the after, Karen told Mark that other women had never used her as a measure because she easily receded in groups, most comfortable as an approving spectator.\u201d The effect is to give the events a muffled, offstage quality; the last thing you\u2019d expect from a world-class dramatist.It may be that the habits of mind of a writer accustomed to the luxury of accomplished actors and lavish sets to flesh out his ideas simply don\u2019t lend themselves to the novel, where words have to do it all. But I think the problem has more to with a fundamental uncertainty (again) on Weiner\u2019s part as to precisely what disturbed him about that scene he observed on the street. There are some pithy social observations that suggest an interest in using the encounter for purposes of class satire in the manner of Tom Wolfe, but aside from a running theme about coffee consumption, the book never commits to a sustained look at the specifics of contemporary life. Occasionally a deadpan drollness, reminiscent of George Saunders, flickers in the prose, hinting at a possible interest in doing gothicky Americana, but that\u2019s also fitful. It isn\u2019t that every suspense story has to have some higher purpose. Playing it for pure chills would have been fine by me, but even there the book seems undecided, offering titillating suggestions of incest and darker transgressions one moment, only to back off the next, as if finding itself too squeamish, after all, to go there. What you\u2019re left with is just that calibrated convergence of predator and prey. It holds your attention, but it doesn\u2019t leave you with much.James Lasdun is the author, most recently, of the novel \u201cThe Fall Guy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Phone Maker Bets Big With a Premium Price", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHENZHEN, China \u2014 The phone takes dazzling photos and sports advanced artificial intelligence. Its display stretches gloriously from edge to edge. And at nearly $1,000, it pushes into eye-watering territory on price.But the Mate 10 Pro isn\u2019t the latest high-end offering from Samsung or Apple. It comes from China \u2014 a country that, for all its growing sophistication in technology, has yet to produce a name like Lexus, Canon or Samsung that consumers around the globe associate with premium quality at premium prices.Huawei Technologies, the new smartphone\u2019s creator, thinks the world is ready to pay top dollar for a Chinese product. It is rolling out the Mate 10 Pro \u2014 plus two sibling devices, one less expensive and lower spec, the other pricier and sleeker \u2014 in Europe, in the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia. And it is in talks with AT&T to offer the phones in the United States, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions are not public.\u201cWe see good signs that people have seen the brand change to a large degree,\u201d to one that is \u201cstylish and innovative,\u201d said Glory Cheung, Huawei\u2019s marketing chief for consumer devices. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very good sign for us.\u201dStill, Ms. Cheung said, Huawei would rather spend on developing smarter features and better technology than on marketing, even as she acknowledged the importance of building an emotional bond with users. The challenge for the company on that last front is significant: Compared with Apple or Samsung, Huawei has much further to go in forging that elusive something that leads someone to commit to a brand.Even in China, many people still view Huawei devices as good value for the money and not much else.Li Haoran, a 24-year-old accountant in Beijing, is a longtime Apple user. Would she switch to Huawei?\u201cNot for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019d consider buying Huawei phones for my family, because they are relatively cheap.\u201dAs for the Mate 10 series, Li Weitao, a 40-year-old marketer in Shanghai who is no relation to Li Haoran, said that for more than $600, \u201cyou should probably get an iPhone.\u201dFounded in Shenzhen three decades ago, Huawei was already one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of telecommunications equipment when it released its first Android smartphone in 2009. Its earliest handsets were run-of-the-mill in looks and performance. But Huawei has since invested more in design and technology, opening a design center in London and a research and development facility in Finland.With the Mate 10 series, Huawei is debuting one of the fruits of its research: a processor dedicated to artificial-intelligence tasks such as identifying people in photos and translating text.Christophe Coutelle, vice president of software marketing for Huawei, said the new processor let the phones perform such tasks more quickly, with less power and \u2014 as no data needs to be sent to a faraway server \u2014 with better privacy protection.\u201cNot everyone is willing to share all of their information, pictures and everything with cloud-based services,\u201d he said.The emphasis on privacy could help Huawei crack its last big untapped market: the United States. The company\u2019s experience there has been fraught.Its network-equipment business has effectively been banned in the United States since a congressional report said in 2012 that Huawei gear could be used by Beijing to spy on Americans. The company\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei, was once an engineer in China\u2019s military. Huawei has said its products pose no threat to security.Huawei\u2019s international presence and diverse work force make it more of a global company than a Chinese one, Ms. Cheung said. Whether Huawei is a global name \u2014 and an appealing one \u2014 is another matter.\u201cThe brand still lacks personality,\u201d Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester, said in an email. \u201cThe focus is still too much on technical specifications and functionalities.\u201dFiguring out how to strike a chord with ordinary consumers was never going to be easy for Huawei, which has spent most of its existence selling back-end equipment to mobile carriers.It has enlisted Scarlett Johansson to star in ads, and teamed up with Porsche and Leica on design. Yet Huawei still has \u201cvery much of an engineering culture,\u201d Mr. Coutelle said. In conversation, employees rarely fail to mention how much the company spends on research and development (more than 10 percent of revenue) or the number of its workers involved in research (nearly half).The company\u2019s attitude, Mr. Coutelle said, had long been that its products spoke for themselves \u2014 that there was no need to hard-sell anyone on their superiority. \u201cBut I think this is changing.\u201dHuawei has been touring the world introducing users to its devices\u2019 clever but low-key features. To take a screenshot, for instance, you knock twice on the screen with your knuckle. Drawing an S with your knuckle takes a screenshot of the entire length of a website or app \u2014 the better to share paywalled newspaper articles like this one.Under-the-hood advancements may not drive sales unless Huawei brings them to the less expensive, midtier phones that will almost surely remain its biggest sellers, said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst at the research firm IDC.Mr. Jeronimo said he had laughed when he heard Huawei executives talk, years ago, about becoming a top-three phone maker. Today, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they become No. 1.\u201dOwen Guo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$1.5 Trillion Tax Cut Passed by House in Mostly Party-Line Vote", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Thirteen Republicans voted against the bill, and no Democrats voted for it.\u2022 A new analysis from Congress\u2019s bipartisan tax referee shows that under the Senate\u2019s version of the bill, lower-income Americans would see their taxes go up in 2021.\u2022 The analysis roiled the Senate Finance Committee, which is debating the bill ahead of a vote that could happen as soon as Thursday night.\u2022 Before the House vote, President Trump visited Capitol Hill to rally the Republican lawmakers behind the legislation.The Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress\u2019s bipartisan referee on tax policy, said on Thursday that the amended Senate\u2019s version of the tax bill will raise taxes on low-income Americans beginning in 2021, in what appears to be a side effect of the bill\u2019s decision to repeal the so-called individual mandate that requires most people buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.The committee also forecast that taxpayers earning $75,000 or less would see, as a group, large tax increases in 2027, if the individual tax cuts in the bill expire as scheduled at the end of 2025. Those tax increases would be relative to current law \u2014 meaning that those taxpayers would be worse off in 2027 than they would have been if the bill had not become law.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, called the joint committee analysis \u201castounding\u201d and warned that middle-class taxpayers would get \u201cclobbered\u201d under the latest Republican plan.\u201cWhen you\u2019re reaching for the cranberry sauce, Republicans are going be reaching for your pocketbooks to give handouts to multinational corporations,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said that the appearance of a tax increase was a mirage that is the result of arcane scoring rules. Because people will no longer have to purchase health insurance, they may no longer receive tax credit subsidies for insurance that they do not purchase.\u201cWithout those credits, they see an overall uptick in their tax liability,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.The debate then devolved into an argument over what really counts as an increase and the murkiness of government scorekeeping, which Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, called \u201cridiculous.\u201dUninterested in letting go of numbers that supported his argument that the Republican tax plan is bad for the middle class, Mr. Wyden dismissed Mr. Toomey\u2019s concerns.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard a senator try to psychoanalyze a Joint Committee on Taxation table,\u201d he said.Representatives voted along party lines, with the exception of 13 Republicans, many of whom fought to keep the deduction for state and local taxes.\u201cI just have too many constituents who are going to see their taxes go up,\u201d Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, who voted against the bill, said at a news conference. \u201cYou\u2019re taking more money from a place like New York in order to pay for deeper tax cuts elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Zeldin said.Of the 13 Republicans who voted against the bill, nine were from New York and New Jersey: Mr. Zeldin, Dan Donovan, John J. Faso, Peter T. King, Elise Stefanik, Rodney Frelinghuysen, Christopher H. Smith, Leonard Lance and Frank A. LoBiondo. Three California Republicans voted against the bill, Darrell Issa, Dana Rohrabacher and Tom McClintock, as did one North Carolina Republican, Walter B. Jones.Mr. Donovan, the lone House Republican from New York City, said he and his New York colleagues wanted to cut taxes. \u201cBut not on the backs of our constituents,\u201d he said.\u201cFor the first time in 31 years we are wiping the tax code clean and replacing it with one that is fairer and simpler for everyone,\u201d said Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California.\u201cFor almost a decade, Americans suffered under Obamanomics,\u201d said Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas. \u201cTheir savings remained decimated, their paychecks were stagnant, and their American dreams were diminished.\u201dNow, he declared, \u201ca new day has dawned.\u201d\u201cWe are on the precipice of passing a fairer, flatter, simpler, more competitive tax code, one built for three percent-plus economic growth,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called the legislation \u201chistoric\u201d and said it \u201crepresents a crucial step to fulfilling our tax reform promise to the American people. But it\u2019s not the final step. We\u2019re Republicans. We believe the tax code doesn\u2019t belong to Washington, it belongs to the American people. We\u2019ll continue to work to make it better and improve at every step of the way.\u201dPaul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the House speaker, took to the floor to loud applause, where he called the tax bill a \u201cgenerational-defining moment.\u201d He held up several charts that showed tax savings for typical households, along with the \u201cpostcard\u201d he said most Americans will be able to use to file their taxes. \u201cNot only do people get to keep more of their own money in their own pocket, but we dramatically simplify the tax system,\u201d he said.\u201cPassing this bill is the single biggest thing we can do to grow the economy, to restore opportunity, and help these middle-income families who are struggling.\u201d\u201cThis is a horror show today,\u201d Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. \u201cThis is a horror show debate. This is a horror show process. But it\u2019s a disaster for the American people. The bill we are debating today will abandon millions of American families.\u201d\u201cThis is a historic moment, but most importantly it\u2019s a missed opportunity,\u201d said Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cWhat we\u2019re being asked to do here today is to raise taxes on 36 million middle-class Americans.\u201dAnother Democrat, Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, began shouting from the lectern about the drawbacks of the bill.\u201cRepublicans and President Trump are doling out tax breaks for companies to move overseas but will take away benefits to hire American veterans right here at home.\u201d\u201cOn behalf of hard working Americans throughout this country I say vote no on H.R. 1. Vote no on H.R. 1 percent.\u201dRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said the package being voted on was not tax reform but \u201ca tax scam.\u201d\u201cWith straight faces and with the speed of light \u2014 I have to give them credit \u2014 they raced this thing through in the dark of night. They\u2019re trying to sell a bill of goods to the middle class that this is in their interest, that this is a middle income tax cut,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cRepublicans are raising taxes on 36 million middle-class families.\u201dThe Senate now has to take up its own version of the tax bill, which is still being debated in the Finance Committee.A vote by the panel could come as early as Thursday night, and the full Senate is planning to vote on the legislation after Thanksgiving. It remains to be seen how the Senate and House will resolve the differences in their bills if the tax cut does, indeed, pass the full Senate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zimbabwe\u2019s Military, in Apparent Takeover, Says It Has Custody of Mugabe", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 Zimbabwe\u2019s military said early Wednesday that it had taken custody of President Robert Mugabe, the world\u2019s oldest head of state and one of Africa\u2019s longest-serving leaders, in what increasingly appeared to be a military takeover in the southern African nation.After apparently seizing the state broadcaster, ZBC, two uniformed officers said in a short predawn announcement that \u201cthe situation in our country has moved to another level.\u201d While denying that the military had seized power, they said that Mr. Mugabe and his family \u201care safe and sound, and their security is guaranteed.\u201d\u201cWe are only targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country in order to bring them to justice,\u201d said the main speaker, who was identified as Maj. Gen. S. B. Moyo, the army\u2019s chief of staff.General Moyo \u2014 who was not widely known to the public but who was considered close to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces, Gen. Constantine Chiwenga \u2014 warned that \u201cany provocation will be met with an appropriate response.\u201dAround 6 a.m. on Wednesday, taxis were running on the main roads leading to central Harare and people seemed to be making their way to work. Some soldiers could be seen on the main roads but were not stopping commuters.After the short announcement, commercials on farming and corn seeds appeared on the state broadcaster. There was no further clarification of the whereabouts or status of Mr. Mugabe, 93, who is the only leader his nation has known since independence in 1980.Asked in a brief telephone interview about reports of a possible coup, Zimbabwe\u2019s information minister, Simon Khaya Moyo, said, \u201cWhat can I say? I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d He did not elaborate.The television announcement came after a long night of rumors and sketchy reports in Harare that a coup might be underway. The day before, in a remarkable act of defiance, General Chiwenga had warned that \u201cwhen it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in.\u201dGeneral Chiwenga visited China last week and met with top military officials there. Asked Wednesday whether he had informed them of plans for a military takeover, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said he was \u201cnot aware of the details\u201d but that the visit had been \u201ca normal military exchange,\u201d The Associated Press reported.China and Zimbabwe have long been allies, and Mr. Mugabe has been warmly welcomed on regular visits to Beijing. Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa went to China for military training in the 1960s, when China supported Mr. Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army.Since his removal, the whereabouts of Mr. Mnangagwa, who like Mr. Mugabe was a veteran of the country\u2019s struggle for independence, has been shrouded in mystery.The question of who will succeed Mr. Mugabe has long haunted Zimbabwe and its political class and led to conflicts among its members even as the country\u2019s once-promising economy shriveled.In Harare, as uncertainty over the political situation grew overnight, foreign embassies warned their citizens to stay indoors on Wednesday. The United States Embassy said on its website that \u201cas a result of the ongoing political uncertainty through the night, the ambassador has instructed all employees to remain home tomorrow.\u201dAmerican citizens, the embassy said, \u201care encouraged to shelter in place until further notice.\u201dOn Tuesday, neither the military nor Mr. Mugabe issued any public statements even as rumors of a possible coup surfaced on social media and in the streets. But Mr. Moyo asserted in a statement that \u201cthe ruling ZANU-PF reaffirms the primacy of politics over the gun.\u201dMr. Moyo, who is also the party\u2019s national secretary for information and publicity, said the statement by General Chiwenga \u201csuggests treasonable conduct on his part as this was meant to incite insurrection and violent challenge to constitutional order.\u201d\u201cPurporting to speak on behalf of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces,\u201d he said, \u201cwas not only surprising but was an outrageous vitiation of professional soldiership and his wartime record as high-ranking freedom fighter, entrusted with command responsibilities in a free and democratic Zimbabwe.\u201dMr. Moyo\u2019s statement, broadcast during the evening news hour on state television, came hours after a leader of the party\u2019s Youth League made similar remarks at the ZANU-PF headquarters in Harare.Kudzanayi Chipanga, the youth league\u2019s secretary, suggested that military officers unhappy with the government should first return to civilian life if they wanted to become politicians.\u201cGeneral Chiwenga and all those in the security sector who wish to engage in politics are free to throw their hats in the ring and not hide behind the barrel of the gun,\u201d said Mr. Chipanga, who became a favorite of Zimbabwe\u2019s first family after he helped organize a march last year in support of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s leadership.The youth league accused the general of siding with a faction loyal to Mr. Mnangagwa. The league has urged that Mrs. Mugabe be endorsed as the new vice president in a party conference scheduled for next month.Jeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, Zimbabwe and Norimitsu Onishi from Johannesburg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Cars Cooperate", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "Someday cars will drive themselves and coordinate with one another and smart cities and roadways to eliminate traffic jams and accidents \u2014 including the fatal one that happens in the United States every 15 minutes \u2014 while reducing fuel consumption and effectively giving back to Americans an annual per-capita average of 335 hours in which, for better or worse, they can use their hands and eyeballs in other ways. When and in what shape this utopian future will arrive, though, remains a persistent mystery. What is certain is that those who play the largest roles in solving it will be in a position to dictate \u2014 as those who control infrastructure always have been \u2014 which people and places they will empower and which they will upend.An intelligent automated future, however, depends on the maturation of two entirely separate sets of technologies. The first \u2014 and the one that has drawn most of the investment and media attention in the last five years \u2014 will allow vehicles to drive themselves without any input from their surroundings. The other set of technologies will connect vehicles to their surroundings and to one another, in order to optimize the functioning of the vehicular ecosystem as a whole. Ultimately, these two types of systems will have to complement each other, yet neither can be implemented all at once. In the meantime, the process of developing and deploying them often puts them at odds. Indeed, the two systems are, in a sense, philosophically opposed: libertarian self-reliance in a race with socialist collectivity to be the first to improve traffic flow.In Silicon Valley and elsewhere, where numerous start-ups are competing with software giants like Google and Uber in the \u201cself-driving\u201d category, Peloton has left high-level automation out of its immediate business plan. Rather, it has staked its early success \u2014 and the money of investors like UPS, Volvo and Intel \u2014 on a cooperative technology known as \u201cvehicle-to-vehicle communication,\u201d or V2V, which makes use of a shortwave portion of the radio spectrum that the Federal Communications Commission set aside in 1999 primarily for traffic-safety messaging. A signal can zip through this bandwidth thousands of times faster than the second or two it might typically take a driver to react. This valuable swath of ether (worth billions to the telecommunications industry, which is currently lobbying the F.C.C. to \u201cshare\u201d it) facilitates unlimited potential applications, not just for sending data among vehicles but also for syncing them with traffic lights and other features of the environment. Currently, vehicles using it \u2014 the vast majority belonging to research pilot projects \u2014 broadcast encrypted information 10 times per second to any receivers within 1,000 feet that can decode it. This means that, unlike vehicles that are automated but not connected, they can \u201csee\u201d beyond their actual field of view: an accident just over the crest of a hill, an oncoming car around the corner. \u201cIt will save lives, and everybody knows that,\u201d says Harry Lightsey, the executive director for emerging-technologies policy at General Motors, maker of the 2017 Cadillac CTS, the first commercially available car in the United States to carry the technology. \u201cA delay in rolling out V2V will cost lives, and that\u2019s a tragedy.\u201dPeloton believes that trucking companies are the natural place to start: They can outfit entire fleets at once and reap significant benefits from small improvements. Moreover, most of the 279 billion annual miles trucks travel are on highways, which are far more predictable than city streets and therefore an easier environment in which to usher in new driving features. Thus, the trucking industry is poised to be among the first to adopt both V2V and automated technologies on a grand scale, possibly becoming the arena in which they will compete with each other most ferociously for initial relevance and public acceptance.On the day I met Mercer, he and Jake Gregory, a veteran F.B.I. agent who drove trucks in college and directed safety operations for a small fleet after leaving the bureau, were demonstrating Peloton\u2019s first V2V application, called \u201cplatooning,\u201d in a pair of 18-wheelers. (\u201cPeloton,\u201d the French word for \u201cplatoon,\u201d also designates the main pack of cyclists in a road race.) They eased out onto I-280 with Mercer in the lead. I rode with Gregory, whose cab had been retrofitted with theater-style seats where a bunk bed used to be. These were occupied by Steve Boyd, a Peloton founder, who oversees external affairs; Oliver Bayley, the head of user experience design; and Rod McLane, the company\u2019s marketing manager.Gregory flipped a switch on the dash, and a screen \u2014 mounted where a car\u2019s rearview mirror usually is \u2014 blinked on. \u201cPlatooning not authorized in this area,\u201d it said. The system, Gregory said, was calculating the weight of Mercer\u2019s truck ahead: \u201cIt takes a few minutes for it to establish mass.\u201d The software also used a cellular signal to check with a cloud-based server run by Peloton engineers to see if Gregory was in an appropriate location: a divided highway accessible by only on-off ramps, more easily negotiated than crossings.The system chimed, and the message changed: \u201cReady to platoon.\u201d Gregory pressed a button that allowed Mercer\u2019s truck to take control of his throttle and braking systems over the V2V bandwidth. It began to reel Gregory\u2019s truck in until they were exactly 66 feet apart. By maintaining that gap, it created a slipstream that reduced carbon emissions and saved fuel by an average of 7 percent: 10 percent for the follower and 5 percent for the leader. (A team led by researchers at Purdue University, with a grant from the United States Department of Energy, believes it can help Peloton increase the average to 20 percent, which the team estimates would be worth up to $20 billion a year to the trucking industry.)While continuing to steer, Gregory removed both feet from the pedals and planted them on the floorboard. Mercer slowed at an exit ramp, and Gregory\u2019s truck automatically did, too, beeping at him to resume control. When I first heard about platooning, I imagined it would feel more death-defying, but though the size of the gap had initially unsettled Mercer and Gregory, it attracted little notice on the highway; oblivious passenger-car drivers frequently cut in, dissolving the platoon. In practice, the exercise felt more like an elaborate cruise-control upgrade than the opening bell in a transportation revolution. Bayley agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing!\u201dCritics of V2V, especially those who are solely invested in full automation, dismiss platooning as mere high-speed tailgating. The major added safety benefits, they point out, come from the fact that, in order to platoon, trucks must be equipped with advanced safety features. Peloton readily agrees that its application, whose requirements include air disc brakes and state-of-the-art collision-avoidance, is an incentive for fleets to upgrade. V2V proponents, on the other hand, hope to leverage renewed federal interest in their systems to expand projects that have been gestating for decades. The Department of Transportation, under the outgoing Obama administration, proposed requiring that all new passenger vehicles be equipped with V2V \u2014 at least symbolically moving toward the realization of those goals. Earlier this month, however, reports suggested that the Trump administration might be inclined to shelve the proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s important to get our government leaders to commit to this,\u201d says Larry Head, an engineering professor at the University of Arizona, who is collaborating on V2I applications with Peloton. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait five years. We\u2019re ready now.\u201dAs a society, we routinely make comparable decisions: when we let football players give one another brain damage in the interests of public entertainment; when a surgeon refrains from killing one terminal patient and transplanting his organs into five patients whom they might save. The trolley problem heightens individual culpability by bestowing absolute decision-making power on one person and demanding that she select not between actions but consequences, which in real life are rarely inevitable. Arguably, in doing so, the dilemma tends to reveal our natural inclination to accept fate over premeditation in situations with no happy outcomes, even if planning might partly mitigate an otherwise inevitable tragedy.In recent years, the trolley problem has frequently been adapted to discussions about entirely automated cars, which respond to contingencies with binary logic. Suppose a distracted mother pushes a stroller with her baby in it out in front of such a vehicle \u2014 should the car be programmed to hit them or swerve into a tree? Azim Shariff, the director of the Culture and Morality Lab at the University of California, Irvine, was an author of a 2016 report in Science that described a series of surveys he and colleagues conducted in which participants overwhelmingly approved of autonomous vehicles, as the study terms them, that would \u201csacrifice their passengers for the greater good\u201d and \u201cwould like others to buy them.\u201d Unsurprisingly, however, they expressed a preference to ride themselves in autonomous vehicles that protect their passengers \u201cat all costs.\u201dEngineers tend to scoff at the trolley exercise. (\u201cI think the vehicle\u2019s going to stop,\u201d Larry Head told me.) But Shariff says this response takes the problem too literally. \u201cThat particular scenario may never come up, but the fundamental ethical trade-off that it\u2019s revealing, apportioning risks among people on the road, is going to happen all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt already does.\u201d Inching closer to a cyclist in the right lane to move farther from a semi on the left, for instance, prioritizes your safety over the cyclist\u2019s. Leaving that \u201cdecision\u201d up to your subconscious becomes its own ethical choice, he added, once \u201cthe luxury of deliberation\u201d embodied by the preprogrammed car exists. Human error contributes to an estimated 95 percent of crashes; in theory, automated and connected cars can eliminate our mistakes. \u201cIf you recognize that one option is safer,\u201d Shariff says, \u201cand you choose the other option, that\u2019s a moral decision.\u201dAt the moment, V2V merely transfers information without dictating how it is used. But as its reach expands, potentially linking drivers, carmakers and telecommunications companies with state, city and local governments and other private and public interests in a vast network orchestrating the use of what are essentially lethal weapons, questions of responsibility become more complicated. V2V-enabled vehicles would broadcast their size, speed, acceleration and braking activity and location (down to the lane), according to the latest standards. Who will be allowed to access that data? Will it remain anonymous, as automakers currently intend? Who will defend the network against hackers and keep up-to-date the critical software that collects, analyzes and translates that data into best practices for each of its users? Do drivers have the ultimate right to control their cars \u2014 even if they want to speed, say \u2014 or should the network be programmed to prevent them from doing so? Should it matter whether they\u2019re flooring it because they\u2019re drunk or delivering a pregnant woman in labor to the hospital?Of course, governments and standards organizations already confront similar utilitarian questions. Early airbags were designed to protect men of average height and weight at the expense of those outside the bell curve; when ambulances run red lights to save a dying patient, they increase the risk of death for everyone around them; a turn-only lane might be safer for bicyclists but worsen vehicle congestion or put a store out of business. Still, each of these decisions can be modified on the micro level by human behavior. The ambulance driver\u2019s experience and his reactions to traffic conditions might mitigate his accident risk. An algorithm applies norms uniformly. Those presets would need to function nationwide, which would require countless entities with conflicting interests and values to submit to a single interpretation of what is best for most people. (Until a majority of cars are fully automated and connected, such a network would most likely behave as the Waze navigation app does, delivering information to human or automated drivers for them to interpret.)Unfortunately, as a species, humans are notoriously inept at acting in our own long-term interest. Imagine an algorithm for hurricane evacuation that moves cars faster than human drivers would \u2014 \u201cbalancing the risk of a more-damaging accident from the higher speed against the benefit of getting people out of the evacuation zone faster,\u201d William Whyte, a prominent automotive cybersecurity consultant, wrote to me in an email. \u201cThat would be an algorithm that on average worked better than current practice but, when it failed, would fail worse. I think that people would probably feel uncomfortable with that in the same way that they feel uncomfortable on planes \u2014 there\u2019s a combination of lack of control plus the fact that if things go wrong, they go very wrong, which triggers all the ways that people are very bad at risk assessment.\u201dWithout federal help, however, the upfront cost of connected infrastructure can be prohibitive for small towns and cities. Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and an affiliate scholar at Stanford\u2019s Center for Internet and Society, recently challenged a group of students to come up with ways to secure public funding for vehicle-to-infrastructure technology that would enable more governments to afford it. One idea was to use the technology at intersections to collect traffic data and sell it to the developers of automated systems to improve their algorithms; another was to use the dedicated bandwidth in cars to create a meshlike internet network for rural areas, eliminating the need to put down expensive fiber cable.Perhaps the most provocative idea, Smith told me, was a \u201ccrash bounty.\u201d He explained: \u201cWe\u2019ve posited that V2I can improve safety \u2014 what if you could come up with a scheme for monetizing that? If you could prove you had prevented a crash, you could bill the people who otherwise would have been injured or killed: \u2018Good news, we\u2019re 80 percent sure that we saved you from an injury that would have cost you tens of thousands of dollars, so, insurance company, pay up $40,000 and be happy with that.\u2019\u2009\u201dTo get a sense of how V2V stands to improve the system as a whole, it helps to understand how cities cope without it. To that end, on a recent Monday morning, just after rush hour, I joined Wilson Aleman and Al Vilar, who have been engineers at the Boston Transportation Department for a cumulative five decades, in the Traffic Management Center on the seventh floor of City Hall. Aleman wore a Red Sox cap. Vilar wore glasses with small eyepieces and thick lenses that gave him the look of a jeweler examining a precious stone.In front of them, a bank of screens displayed live video of various intersections: cars double-parking on narrow, curving roads; pedestrians disregarding stoplights. Aleman could remember when the video screens used to be a board with a real-time LED map on it \u2014 and when the department received postmarked letters of complaint instead of tweets, emails and phone calls. Over the last two decades, Boston has connected 68 percent of its lighted intersections to the Traffic Management Center, allowing engineers to adjust the signaling patterns in real time. The department estimates this has reduced travel times by about 15 percent and emissions and crashes by 8 percent each; it also yields economic benefits of approximately $14 million each year, compared with the $318,000 it cost to implement. Still, much of the traffic data \u2014 which helps to determine optimal signal timing as well as the city\u2019s future investments \u2014 comes from people logging car movements by hand. Widespread V2V would give traffic departments like Boston\u2019s a wealth of detailed information about key locations. (If all cars had V2V, they could blaze through complex intersections without stopping at all, modifying their speeds and headings to slide into gaps.) Maintenance, however, would be a significant challenge.Aleman showed me his computer monitor, where the connected lights were represented on a city map as red or green dots. The red dots were ones that weather, construction or local hardware issues had taken offline. He pointed to two reds very close together on Commonwealth Avenue that could strand cars between them and block cross-traffic. \u201cThose are the ones I like to attack,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are important to me.\u201d The phone rang. It was a communications specialist who was elbow-deep in a control box on one of Aleman\u2019s corners, working on a surge protector. \u201cMaybe if you unplug one at a time?\u201d Aleman suggested.On another phone, Vilar was patiently discussing the timing of a new light on Endicott Street at Keany Square with one of the street\u2019s residents. \u201cWe\u2019ll get it so it\u2019s working better; right now it\u2019s working safer because there\u2019s less cars coming at you.\u201d He paused. \u201cThey\u2019re ready to march on City Hall, I know.\u201d One-way, residential Endicott begins as an offshoot of I-93 North and ends where the causeway and the Charlestown Bridge converge as six lanes. The light makes it slower to turn left. But, Vilar explained once he\u2019d hung up, \u201cwe can\u2019t make it beautiful, because then it will siphon off cars from the causeway.\u201dHe pointed to the Endicott video feed where, sure enough, a line of cars was forming. \u201cSee, now it\u2019s like 14 cars deep, people honking \u2014 you want it to be more serene, especially when you\u2019re eating dinner,\u201d he said. But say those cars weren\u2019t there, and I-93 was backed up, and Google Maps began suggesting Endicott as a shortcut. \u201cSo now you\u2019ve got a guy who just got off there, maybe he\u2019s enraged, instead of going 30 he\u2019s going 40, a kid runs out into the street because he\u2019s not used to the traffic being there. ... \u201d Vilar said. \u201cYou want to make it so it\u2019s moving. You want him to think: I\u2019ll be O.K. I don\u2019t want to get off this street. I\u2019ll stay.\u201d A V2V network could make these sorts of intricate adjustments instantly and indefatigably, but it would do so without Vilar\u2019s empathy for the harried commuter or the family conversing over supper.\u201cSometimes people call,\u201d he said, \u201cand they just want to rant, and you\u2019re just a punching bag for those people, and that\u2019s part of the job.\u201d Vilar grew up in the North End; he, his wife and his children still live nearby. \u201cThe woman who just called, she\u2019s almost like an aunt to me,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has my number.\u201dMore than a century later, in the context of platooning, privacy seems to be able to foster community as much as disrupt it. The dedicated channel over which one truck controls others allows the drivers to converse exclusively with one another, as opposed to using their C.B. radio, which is rife with vulgar chatter. Dave Mercer used to keep his turned off unless he needed news about road conditions. But during the test run, he and Jake Gregory exchanged frequent notes on moves they planned to make or vehicles that the other couldn\u2019t see; Mercer described it as \u201cJake and I looking out for each other on the road.\u201dMight the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in this way reform the macho trucking culture, increasing the diversity of drivers, only 5.1 percent of whom are women? Or might including more varied perspectives in the design process result in even more innovative applications of V2V? The homogeneity at leading technology companies is well documented. Still, it seems notable, considering how infrastructure and power reinforce each other, that of the several dozen engineers, academics and standards developers I spoke with whose thinking is shaping the future of V2V, most were white and all but one was male.Artificial systems evolve \u2014 just as natural systems do \u2014 by applying strict rules to events that are often swayed by chance, and the results are frequently surprising. Relinquishing control of our vehicles to algorithms may ultimately transform us from drivers to passengers who tranquilly observe our surroundings from within our bubble or ignore them altogether in favor of watching a movie or checking email. Then again, by the time that sort of algorithm is ready, more and more of us may choose to depend on ride-sharing applications like Uber and Lyft for personal travel and delivery services, or even 3-D printing for goods we once needed a car to go get and pay for. \u201cI have three daughters; they\u2019re totally uninterested in driving,\u201d Jack Pokrzywa, director of global ground vehicle standards for SAE International, told me. \u201cWhen I got my license, I was 17. I was in seventh heaven.\u201dFor those of us for whom a visit to the D.M.V. was a rite of passage, it\u2019s easy to forget that, before Americans found freedom inside a motor vehicle, they found it on foot and astride horses, in covered wagons and trains, on ships, buses, planes, bicycles, roller skates. They found it in pure motion, on a journey to someplace beyond what they could imagine. Where it began and where it ended was still theirs to decide. Likewise, automated connected vehicles stand to make travel safer, maybe even boring, but somebody still has to get in and tell them where to go.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Joins Europe in Fighting China\u2019s Future in W.T.O.", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States has filed arguments to the World Trade Organization in a looming dispute over China\u2019s future in the international body, which could shape the global trading system for decades to come.Senior United States officials said on Wednesday that they had filed a brief to the W.T.O. as a third party in a case that China has brought against the European Union. The brief, which will be made public on Thursday, will lay out their legal arguments for why China does not deserve the designation of a \u201cmarket economy,\u201d a distinction that would entitle it to preferential economic treatment under the W.T.O.The move is likely to ratchet up trade tensions with China, which the White House has called one of the world\u2019s biggest trade offenders. And if China is awarded the designation against the wishes of the United States, it could test the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to remain in the W.T.O., an international body for establishing trade rules and settling disputes that President Trump previously called a \u201cdisaster.\u201dChina is classified as a nonmarket economy, which allows the United States and other countries to use a special framework under W.T.O. rules to decide whether it is \u201cdumping\u201d its products in other countries by selling them at unfairly low prices. Under this framework, the United States can add an extra duty on some Chinese products to help protect American producers.China maintains that the United States and other W.T.O. members promised to award it the market economy label on Dec. 11, 2016, the 15th anniversary of its accession to the W.T.O. But the United States and the European Union have opposed that, claiming that China has failed to hold up its end of the bargain by curtailing the state\u2019s role in the economy. United States officials say the Chinese government\u2019s heavy hand distorts costs and prices in the country and harms competitors abroad.Last December, China challenged both the European Union and the United States at the W.T.O., saying that it was merely protecting its lawful rights. The case with the E.U. is proceeding and could serve as precedent in China\u2019s challenge against the United States, which a W.T.O. panel will consider next.If China succeeds in this case, that would weaken the ability of European and American officials to levy anti-dumping duties against it. It could also strengthen the resolve among top Trump administration officials in their claims that the W.T.O. has been ineffective in defending the interests of Americans abroad \u2014 and perhaps lead to the organization\u2019s demise altogether.Those officials include Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who in his confirmation hearing before the Senate in June described China\u2019s challenge against Europe and the United States as \u201cthe most serious litigation matter we have at the W.T.O. right now.\u201dMr. Lighthizer said that he had \u201cmade it very clear that a bad decision\u201d on China\u2019s status \u201cwould be cataclysmic for the W.T.O.\u201dNicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s statements called into question whether the United States was looking for a reason to withdraw from the W.T.O.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the outcome is going to be, but I think there\u2019s a pretty good chance China is going to prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe this is going to be one of the nominal excuses to taking us out.\u201dOn Wednesday, senior United States officials said that the W.T.O. served a number of purposes, but that they would like to see it work the way members intended it to work.The W.T.O. and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, have been led for decades by the United States and other relatively developed and open economies. As other countries joined, the presumption was always that they were seeking to become more market-driven economies like the United States.But the rise of China has called this into question. Since beginning to open up to world trade in the 1980s, China has maintained an economy that melds market capitalism with state control. Some analysts argue that the state has taken a bigger role in the economy in the last few years, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping.The Trump administration argues that the W.T.O. is ill-equipped to deal with this challenge, and has advocated a more unilateral approach. It is preparing a range of trade actions that could affect China, including investigations into imports of steel and aluminum, as well as China\u2019s violations of intellectual property.On Wednesday, United States officials said that China\u2019s behavior violated the language of the agreement China signed when it joined the W.T.O. 15 years ago, as well as the text of the W.T.O.\u2019s precursor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which calls for using market-determined prices in calculations.The W.T.O. filing follows on another unusual step, in which the Department of Commerce initiated a trade case against Chinese aluminum producers on Tuesday. It was the first time that the United States had started an anti-dumping investigation without a request from the industry involved since 1985.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Adult Children as Partners, Taking an Entrepreneurial Leap", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringAfter Bert Weber retired from his three-decade teaching career, he occupied himself with consulting contracts, but kept hunting for more satisfying, full-time work. His son Christian was running a small environmental nonprofit; he, too, was unfulfilled.Christian had dreamed of owning a craft brewery, and father and son enjoyed home brewing together. On a long drive one weekend five years ago, they decided to take the plunge and go into the beer business. \u201cI liked the concept,\u201d Bert said. \u201cI loved the idea of my son for a business partner.\u201dSo despite having no experience running a brewery, they created a plan and secured a small-business loan. In 2014, they opened Common Roots Brewing Company in South Glens Falls, N.Y. Now, the brewery has 20 employees and is growing steadily, set to sell 5,000 barrels of beer this year.Setting up a multigenerational enterprise can be a smart way for retired baby boomers and their grown children to combine resources and abilities. The adult children bring hustle, and they\u2019re comfortable with the latest technologies. Parents often offer capital and work experience.That said, the financial risks associated with entrepreneurship are daunting, especially for those in their retirement years. The time to recover from a failed enterprise is short, and the consequences of financial losses may be considerably greater for an older person. On top of that, navigating the transition from parent and child to business partners isn\u2019t always easy. And starting a new business is always stressful.Looking back over the past three years, Christian sounds relieved. \u201cWe aren\u2019t living as much hand-to-mouth,\u201d he said. Bert added: \u201cI\u2019m sleeping better now.\u201dSmall-business researchers don\u2019t offer much in the way of data on how many new multigenerational start-ups there are like the Webers\u2019. Still, there are a few statistics: 25.4 percent of new businesses formed in 2016 were started by people age 55 to 64, according to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, up from 14.8 percent in 1996.Largely because of two major societal shifts, it\u2019s quite likely that rising numbers of retirement-age parents and their adult children will at least consider making the leap into entrepreneurship together.First, the combination of longer lives and inadequate retirement savings is pushing more older Americans to earn an income well past their early 60s. The search for meaning and money typically involves encore careers, bridge jobs, part-time employment and entrepreneurship.\u201cFrom what I see, the boomer generation gets to the retirement years, and they\u2019re choosing a different version of retirement than the World War II generation,\u201d said Dennis Ceru, adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. Multigenerational entrepreneurship is \u201cone such option,\u201d he said.The second factor is evidence that many boomer parents and their adult children get along well enough to at least entertain the prospect of starting a business.\u201cMost boomers have a much more friend-based, adult-to-adult relationship with their children than boomers did with their parents,\u201d says Steve King, partner at Emergent Research, a consulting firm in Lafayette, Calif., that concentrates on the small-business economy. \u201cIt\u2019s a big social shift.\u201dFor the first time since the 1960s, living with parents is the most common household arrangement for the 18-to-34-year-old age group, reports Pew Research Center. In 2014, more than 32 percent of young adults lived with their parents, up from 20 percent in 1960.Much of that reflects tough economic circumstances and delayed marriage, experts say, but the trend seems broad enough that it may also involve lifestyle choices and good relationships.Comparing intergenerational survey data from the 2000s with data from the 1980s, the authors of the academic study \u201cThe baby boomers Intergenerational Relationships\u201d note that in 1988 less than half of parents surveyed offered advice to their grown child in the past month, compared with 89 percent in 2008. In addition, 31 percent provided practical assistance in 1988, compared with 69 percent two decades later.These results echo the key finding from a 2012 survey commissioned by AARP: that young adults \u201ccommunicate more, interact more, and are comfortable sharing more with their parents compared to boomers when they were young adults.\u201dFor parents who go into business with their grown children, a foundation of mutual trust and ongoing communication should improve the odds of success, Mr. King said. Take the experience of the Burches of Hudson, Wis., who decided, over lunch one day, to open a retail store a decade ago.The lunch included Elizabeth, a part-time college professor, then 65; her husband Dan, a retired pastor, then 69; and two of their children, Sarah, 37; and Leah, 43. They debated how to lean against what they saw as increasing polarization in society, while also earning an income. Together, they came up with an idea: a gift shop selling sustainable, often handmade items with what they called bipartisan appeal. Six weeks later, they opened the Purple Tree in Hudson, with the parents putting up some $10,000. (The name plays off purple as a mix of red and blue.)\u201cWe don\u2019t always agree,\u201d says Sarah, the only family member working full-time at Purple Tree. \u201cBut we have managed to successfully agree to disagree and we have been able to reach compromises. We always find a way to talk things out.\u201d The rest of the family shares income from the shop.Less benign factors can play a role in the embrace of multigenerational entrepreneurship. Age discrimination can be a major hurdle to employment for those 50 years and over. At the same time, young people can find it tough to land a job that\u2019s engaging and offers a career path. For both age cohorts, starting a business can often be a better alternative.Those were the realities that Rick Harris and his son Tim faced a few years ago.Rick had worked for years on factory floors in California before building a small business in the Bay Area that specialized in setting up office interiors for start-ups. But business fell off during the financial crisis of 2008.In 2009, the family moved to Minneapolis, where Rick\u2019s wife, Donna, took a job as head of a private high school in Minneapolis. At age 62, Rick started a new commercial interior venture in the Twin Cities, but the market proved tough for an outsider to break into.He said he soon began to ask himself, \u201cHow long do I want to work?\u201dAt this stage, his son, Tim, was still a student. Tim started college in California but transferred to Concordia College in St. Paul, near his family, and graduated in 2015 with a degree in communication studies.Tim pursued jobs with advertising and public relations agencies in the Twin Cities. He had plenty of interviews, but they went nowhere.After the unsuccessful job hunt, Tim asked his father if he could join him in his still young business, Ideal Commercial Interiors \u2014 which was essentially a one-man operation. Rick said yes.\u201cWhat got me rejuvenated is my son wanting to come into the business,\u201d Rick said. \u201cTim wants to grow the business. He can be a lot more successful than I ever was.\u201dThey have their moments, usually sparring over technology \u2014 but the partnership is working out. Ideal did between $300,000 to $400,000 in business two years ago, a figure that rose to about $1.3 million last year.For all the successes, entrepreneurship isn\u2019t for everyone. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that about 20 percent of small businesses fail in their first year, and by year five, half close. Those are discouraging odds, especially for older Americans contemplating retirement. In addition, not all families get along. Even for family members who do like one another, dealing with blurred boundaries can be trying.\u201cIt gets back to the relationship challenge,\u201d Mr. King said.Most important, starting a business typically means putting in long hours, including weekends. Many people of retirement age look forward to more flexible schedules, even if they keep earning an income.\u201cMost people choose to scale back and pursue other interests,\u201d Mr. Ceru said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.P.A. Heads to Coal Country to Hear Views on an Obama Climate Rule", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 The Environmental Protection Agency convened a public hearing on Tuesday on its plan to roll back the signature climate change rule of the Obama administration. More than 270 people signed up to speak.The proposal sparked a bitter fight from coal interests and from many conservative state officials. The former Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, was one of the officials in 29 states who filed a lawsuit to fight the plan. President Trump named Mr. Pruitt head of the E.P.A., where he has made it a top priority to reverse what he has called the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cwar on coal.\u201dAs part of a broad effort to uproot the environmental policies of the Obama administration, Mr. Pruitt announced in October that he would kill the Clean Power Plan, which he said did not follow regulatory norms and imposed undue burdens on states and energy producers. Tuesday\u2019s public hearing was a required part of undoing the regulation.Mr. Pruitt did not attend.Before the hearing began, Mr. Murray warmly greeted dozens of miners whom his company brought in by bus for the event. \u201cYou all know you have to work the afternoon shift now,\u201d he joked.Several groups are also holding an alternate hearing across the Kanawha River, at the University of Charleston, to discuss the environmental, health and climate benefits of reducing coal consumption. \u201cThe Clean Power Plan has a lot of support,\u201d said Bill Price, a local organizer for the Sierra Club who grew up in the area and whose father worked in the coal mines. Since the shift to power sources like solar and wind create jobs and clean the environment, he said, the Clean Power Plan is \u201cpro-worker, pro-economy and it\u2019s pro-environment.\u201dThis is the sole hearing scheduled on repealing the plan; the Obama administration held four such hearings in creating it. A spokesman for the E.P.A. said, \u201cWe continue to assess the needs for additional hearings, and in the meantime encourage all stakeholders to submit their comments to the public docket, which will be open until January 16, 2018.\u201dFollow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reza Zarrab Testifies That He Bribed Turkish Minister", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA gaunt man in tan jail clothes took the witness stand Wednesday and began testifying about how he had bribed a Turkish economy minister as part of a billion-dollar scheme to smuggle gold for oil in violation of United States sanctions on Iran.The witness, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, had been charged with conspiring to violate the sanctions and had faced a trial with Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an official with Halkbank, a Turkish state bank that prosecutors say was involved in the scheme.But last month, Mr. Zarrab secretly pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the authorities, a development revealed when Mr. Atilla\u2019s trial opened in Federal District Court in Manhattan this week.As Mr. Zarrab testified against Mr. Atilla, he was asked by a prosecutor why he had decided to help the American authorities. He offered a pragmatic reason.\u201cCooperation was the fastest way to accept responsibility and to get out of jail at once,\u201d he said.Mr. Zarrab is currently being held at an undisclosed location \u2014 in F.B.I. custody and not in a hotel, he told the court.\u201cAre you free to come and go as you please?\u201d the prosecutor, Sidhardha Kamaraju, asked.\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d he said.The prosecution of Mr. Zarrab, Mr. Atilla and seven other people who remain at large \u2014 including the former economy minister, Zafer Caglayan \u2014 has sent tremors through Turkish political circles.Allegations that Mr. Caglayan had taken bribes surfaced in a 2013 Turkish police investigation, when Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was prime minister. A prosecutor told the jury on Tuesday that corrupt Turkish officials had shut down that inquiry, but that the F.B.I.\u2019s own investigation \u201ctells the same story\u201d as the Turkish police found.Mr. Erdogan has bitterly condemned the new prosecution and sought to persuade American officials to drop it.Mr. Zarrab\u2019s first day of testimony was focused on his decision to cooperate and on how he carried out the scheme. He said he had paid Mr. Caglayan tens of millions of dollars in bribes, and took the jury through accounting records that were displayed on a screen and listed the amounts and dates of the payments.Mr. Zarrab, 34, usually has a thick black beard but had shaved it for the trial. During the questioning, he appeared calm. He looked directly at the prosecutor, answering his questions through an interpreter in a polite tone and with an earnest manner.He became more animated when describing the methods he had used to get around the sanctions, gesturing and blinking rapidly as he explained how he had transferred gold and money.When Mr. Kamaraju asked him to step down from the witness stand and draw diagrams on white poster board to show how his scheme worked, Mr. Zarrab almost resembled a business-school lecturer, sketching lines and boxes with colored markers and explaining as he went.\u201cIn other words, the blue and the red lines would merge here,\u201d he told the jury.After he had finished, the judge, Richard M. Berman, asked him approximately how many separate transactions he had drawn on his last diagram \u201cto get the money from where it couldn\u2019t leave to where it could leave.\u201dAfter counting, Mr. Zarrab declared, \u201cA minimum of 10.\u201dOnly occasionally did he appear slightly uncomfortable, shuffling in his chair and taking a sip of water as he identified the defendant, Mr. Atilla, 47, who was seated at the defense table.Mr. Kamaraju also asked whether Mr. Zarrab had hired lawyers to explore whether he could be released as part of a prisoner exchange.\u201cWithin the legal limits, yes, of course,\u201d Mr. Zarrab said.The reference was apparently to Mr. Zarrab\u2019s decision to retain Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and an informal adviser to President Trump, and Michael B. Mukasey, a former United States attorney general, to try to negotiate a diplomatic resolution to his case.The lawyers met with President Erdogan and talked with senior Trump administration officials.\u201cWere they successful?\u201d Mr. Kamaraju asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Zarrab replied.By the end of the day in Turkey, and more than four hours after Mr. Zarrab testified about bribing Mr. Caglayan, neither the Turkish state broadcaster nor the news agency had reported on the testimony.Yet Twitter was abuzz with tens of thousands of Turks following live feeds from other news outlets, such as BBC Turkish and other independent news sites, causing \u201cZafer Caglayan\u201d to become a worldwide Twitter trending topic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Xi Jinping\u2019s (Airbrushed) Face Is Plastered All Over China", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "Advertisement\nMao Zedong, c. 1950Xi Jinping, 2017Mao Zedong, c. 1950Xi Jinping, 2017President Xi Jinping is China\u2019s most powerful leader in decades. Not since the days of Mao Zedong has one figure so dominated Chinese life. Mr. Xi, who welcomed President Trump to China on Wednesday, cannot yet match Mao\u2019s grandeur. But he has inspired a devout following that some critics describe as the early stages of a personality cult.Here\u2019s how Mr. Xi has used the tried-and-true strategies of autocrats to present himself as a transformative figure.Perhaps the most telling sign of Mr. Xi\u2019s dominance came last month, when he was awarded a second five-year term as China\u2019s leader.The layouts of Communist Party newspapers are carefully designed to signal the relative power of top officials after leadership reshuffles every five years. For decades, the front page of People\u2019s Daily embodied a \u201ccollective leadership\u201d model as the party sought to spread power more evenly after Mao's death in 1976.197719821987199219972002200720121977198219871992199720022007201219771982198719921997200220072012But Mr. Xi was awarded a different layout. His beaming face evoked the days of one-man rule and unmistakably placed him on a pedestal with Mao.2017The faces of the other six members of China\u2019s most powerful body are barely visible.2017The faces of the other six members of China\u2019s most powerful body are barely visible.2017The faces of the other six members of China\u2019s most powerful body are barely visible.During his decades in power, Mao exerted virtually unchecked authority over the government. Even as Mao\u2019s decisions led to violence across China during the Cultural Revolution, splitting families and engulfing the country in chaos, the media depicted him as a generous leader motivated only by his love of country.Mr. Xi is far from cultivating Mao\u2019s sort of following. And historians said creating and maintaining the image of a cult figure is trickier than it was in the days of Mao, when the novelty of loudspeakers and television were able to reach a more receptive and captive audience.\u201cNowadays, there\u2019s a certain cynicism,\u201d said Daniel Leese, a professor of Chinese history at the University of Freiburg. \u201cAt the time, it was brand new.\u201dBut Mr. Xi has consolidated power at a remarkable pace for a man who was virtually unknown outside China when he rose to power in 2012.In the front-page version of Mr. Xi\u2019s portrait, the color and saturation were adjusted, hiding gray hairs and skin imperfections and giving the photo the feel of a painting, said Hany Farid, a professor at Dartmouth College and an expert on photo forensics.The processed image evokes the same visual style as portraits of Mao, said Jan Plamper, professor of history at Goldsmiths, University of London. \u201cIt\u2019d be like depicting Trump more like George Washington.\u201dAt the height of the Mao era, people displayed his image in their homes and wore it as a badge on their clothing. The ubiquity of the image in the most private spaces of Chinese life helped to give him a deified status, said Pang Laikwan, a professor of cultural studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\u201cLoving Mao was in the air and part of people\u2019s everyday life,\u201d Ms. Pang said. \u201cThere was no alternative.\u201dMr. Xi\u2019s slogans are splashed across front pages, and his speeches dominate the evening news. His voice booms from giant television screens in busy plazas and his image hangs inside homes, restaurants and taxi cabs \u2013 often alongside Mao\u2019s.Mr. Xi, the son of revolutionaries, has tapped into Communist Party lore in a way that hearkens back to the era of Mao. By becoming a symbol of the Communist cause, Mr. Xi has sought to bring the party and its values back to the center of everyday life at a time when many Chinese are focused on material wealth.Mr. Xi\u2019s predecessors were criticized as wooden and aloof. Former President Hu Jintao, for example, appeared rigid while visiting the countryside in the eastern province of Anhui in 2008.By contrast, the current president has cultivated a warm, paternalistic image. During a 2016 visit to the southern province of Jiangxi, Mr. Xi came across as personable and down to earth.Mr. Xi\u2019s fatherly persona helps maintain unity behind the Communist Party by crafting a narrative that everyone can understand. \u201cImages have to be legible by the entire society,\u201d said Mr. Plamper.The state-run media has experimented with other strategies for playing up Mr. Xi\u2019s lighter side as well, sometimes portraying him as an animated character. Here is his avatar in a People\u2019s Daily feature promoting China\u2019s dream of developing a leading soccer team by vanquishing corruption in the sports industry. (The ball is labeled \u201cfake.\u201d)Mr. Xi\u2019s writings are mostly aimed at a domestic audience, helping to create a heroic aura and to place him in the same revered ranks of Mao and Deng Xiaoping. His books are often featured in lavish displays with stars and ribbons, a break with the more restrained exhibits afforded many of his predecessors.Increasingly, party officials see Mr. Xi\u2019s writings as a tool to introduce Mr. Xi on the global stage, and his books have been translated into dozens of languages.As the United States enters a period of retreat, many Chinese see Mr. Xi as their best chance at getting ahead globally and weathering storms of the economy and corruption at home. And the party is making sure that everyone in China and abroad knows it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plugging Into the Gig Economy, From Home With a Headset", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "A company called Liveops has become the Uber of call centers by doting on its agents. But is the work liberating, or dehumanizing?Supported byDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 The gathering in a private dining room at a Mexican restaurant had the fervent energy of a megachurch service, or maybe an above-average \u201cOprah\u201d episode \u2014 a mix of revival-style confession and extravagant empathy. There were souls to be won.\u201cBy the end of the day, Kelly\u2019s going to be an agent,\u201d the group\u2019s square-jawed leader said. \u201cKelly went through the process a while ago, then life happens, now she\u2019s back. Her commitment to me that she made earlier, she looked me right in the eyes and told me she\u2019s going to be an agent.\u201dParadise, for these pilgrims, lies at one end of a phone line.The company behind this spectacle, Liveops, had invited several dozen freelance call-center agents to a so-called road show. Some of them may have answered your customer-service calls to Home Depot or AAA. All were among the more than 100,000 agents who work as independent contractors through on-demand platforms like the one Liveops operates, which uses big data, algorithms and gamelike techniques to match its agents to clients. What Uber is to cars, Liveops is to call centers.While critics of the arrangement cite rising insecurity, some of Liveops\u2019 star agents \u2014 like Emmett Jones in Chicago, who knows of his rivals primarily as numbers on a leader board \u2014 say the opportunity has been transformative.The earnest gratitude of the agents assembled here, not far from the Raleigh-Durham Airport, affirmed that. To them, Liveops is a sustaining force, a way to earn a living while being present at home. A few had driven hours to attend. Many brought friends and family members who were considering joining \u201cLiveops Nation,\u201d too.There were icebreakers (\u201cLiveops Nation Bingo\u201d). Gift-card raffles (\u201c$150?\u201d the chief executive quipped. \u201cWho approved these things?\u201d). Free enchiladas. Everyone was invited to schmooze.\u201cJohn, I heard your story about how you got to us is pretty great,\u201d said the master of ceremonies, an impossibly sunny woman named Tara. \u201cWould you mind telling all these people?\u201dWhen the mic came to John, a former insurance claims adjuster with a gray beard and several earrings, there was a sense of imminent revelation.\u201cI was working in another glass box over near here for six years,\u201d he began. \u201cI reached the point where it was either jump off the roof or walk out the front door.\u201d The other agents laughed knowingly.He continued: \u201cMy commute now is I walk down the hall, close the bedroom door behind me.\u201d More laughter.Then John\u2019s voice softened: \u201cThis is good, this is good. I get paid for when I\u2019m working, instead of souring when you get paid for 40 hours and work some more. So, I\u2019m here.\u201d\u201cAwesome,\u201d Tara said, applause drowning her out. \u201cI feel like John\u2019s story mimics a lot of what we hear from people.\u201dAccording to Greg Hanover, a longtime Liveops official who became chief executive this summer, the company\u2019s goal is to make agents feel as if they\u2019re part of a movement, not just earning a wage.\u201cWhere we want to be with this is what Mary Kay has done, multilevel marketing companies,\u201d Mr. Hanover said, referring to the cosmetics distributor and its independent sales force. \u201cThe direction we need to head in for the community within Liveops Nation is that the agents are so happy, so satisfied with the purpose and meaning there, that they\u2019re telling their story.\u201dIt\u2019s an ambition that feels almost radical compared with Uber, whose best-known exercise in worker outreach is a video of its former chief executive berating a driver. It was heartening to discover that on-demand work could be both financially viable and emotionally fulfilling.That is, until I began to speak with Mr. Jones and some of his Liveops competitors. The more you talk with them, the more you detect a kind of Darwinian struggle behind the facade of community and self-actualization. You start to wonder: Is there really such a thing as a righteous gig-economy job, even if the company is as apparently well intentioned as Liveops? Or is there something about the nature of gig work that\u2019s inescapably dehumanizing?Mr. Jones, who lives in Chicago, was the top rated Liveops agent for an insurer called TruStage for much of this year.An AT&T technician for decades, he decided that he needed to be at home not long after his wife was diagnosed with vertigo in 2008. \u201cI can\u2019t work and be worried about how she\u2019s doing,\u201d he said.A few years later, when his daughter told him of a friend who worked with Liveops, he was eager to sign up \u2014 but refused to send in his required voice test until it was close to perfect. \u201cI must have did the voice test four or five times,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to make sure I gave the right tone that they were looking for.\u201dAs a Liveops agent, Mr. Jones sells life policies to callers, often those who have just seen a television commercial for TruStage insurance. He estimates that he works roughly 40 hours each week, beginning around 8 most mornings, and that he makes about $20 an hour. He is such a valued worker that TruStage invited him to its headquarters earlier this year for a two-day visit by an elite group of agents, in which executives pumped them for insights about how to increase sales.Roughly two decades ago, Liveops and its competitors typically connected callers to psychic hotlines, and in some cases less reputable services. Such businesses had frequent spikes in call volume, making it helpful to have an on-demand work force that could be abruptly ramped up.\u201cThe only thing people were interested in was the abandonment rate\u201d \u2014 that is, the number of people who would hang up in frustration from being kept on hold \u2014 said Kim Houlne, the chief executive of a Liveops rival called Working Solutions, which she founded in 1996.The call center industry took a hit during the 2001 recession, when cost consciousness unleashed a wave of outsourcing to India. But within 10 years, many companies decided that the practice, known as offshoring, had been oversold. The savings on wages were often wiped out by lost business from enraged customers, who preferred to communicate with native English speakers.\u201cPeople don\u2019t feel comfortable,\u201d Ms. Houlne said, alluding to the overseas agents.By the early part of this decade, quality was in fashion. The enormous amounts of data that companies like Liveops and Working Solutions collect allowed them to connect callers to the best possible agent with remarkable precision, while allowing big clients to avoid the overhead of a physical call center and full-time workers.Today, in addition to sales calls, Liveops agents handle calls from people trying to file insurance claims, those in need of roadside assistance, even those with medical or financial issues relating to prescription drugs. The agents must obtain a certification before they can handle such calls, which sometimes takes weeks of online coursework.Liveops goes to great lengths to attend to their needs, addressing technical-support issues, even answering agents\u2019 emails to the chief executive within 24 hours.The start-up has undertaken an extraordinary experiment in behavioral science to subtly entice an independent work force to maximize company revenue.Mr. Jones, like many of his fellow agents, thinks of himself as helping others in need. He said that many families will gather around a table after a loved one has died to discuss the burial. If the deceased relative had no insurance, he said, \u201cA lot of times that table is going to clear.\u201d If, on the other hand, he had even $2,000 in life insurance \u2014 the minimum that TruStage sells \u2014 \u201cthe family members are more inclined to say, \u2018He did what he could, let me see what I could do to help out.\u2019 You end up with $5,000 to $6,000. You can do a decent burial rather than none at all.\u201dStill, there is undeniably a brass-tacks quality to the work. Shortly after we hung up, I turned my attention to an assignment due that afternoon, only to receive more calls from Mr. Jones\u2019s number. When I finally answered, he apologized for interrupting me, then came to the point. \u201cI have a question for you,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you have life insurance?\u201dLike Uber, Liveops expends considerable effort calculating demand for its agents. For example, if an auto insurance company is running a commercial on ESPN, Liveops will ask the company\u2019s media buyer \u2014 that is, the intermediary that placed the ad \u2014 to predict how many calls such an ad is likely to generate. Liveops will adjust that prediction, using its own data showing how many calls similar ads have produced from similar audiences during a comparable time of year.And like Uber, the Liveops focuses on \u201cutilization\u201d \u2014 in the Liveops case, the percentage of working agents actually on a call. Depending on the client, Liveops strives for rates of 65 percent to 75 percent. Lower than that and the agents, who make money only when they\u2019re on a call, will complain that they\u2019re not busy enough. Significantly higher and the system is vulnerable to a sudden increase in demand that could tie up the phone lines and keep callers waiting.Liveops asks agents to schedule themselves in half-hour blocks, known as \u201ccommits,\u201d for the upcoming week. If the company expects demand to be higher than the number of commits, it sends agents a message urging them to sign up. (Uber does something similar, except without formal scheduling.) Sometimes it will even offer financial incentives, like a bump in the rate earned for each minute they\u2019re on a call, or a raffle-type scheme in which people accumulate tickets for the giveaway of an iPad or a cruise.Again like Uber, Liveops relentlessly tests the effectiveness of these tools. Referring to financial incentives, Jon Brown, the Liveops senior director of client services, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve zeroed in on exactly what we need for an agent to go from 10 to 15 commits, from 15 commits to 20 commits. We know where the price point is, what drives behavior.\u201dAnd then there are the performance metrics. Liveops agents are rated according to what are called key performance indicators, which, depending on the customer, can include the number of sales they make, their success at upselling customers, and whether a caller would recommend the service based on their interaction.Liveops makes clear that its agents\u2019 ability to earn more money is closely tied to performance. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard the term meritocracy?\u201d said a Liveops official named Aimee Matolka at the North Carolina event. \u201cWhen a call comes in, it routes in to that best agent. Yes, our router is that smart. You guys want to be that agent, I know you do. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201dIt allows the agents to track their rankings obsessively through internal leader boards. (Liveops officials say that while the pressures of the job can preoccupy agents, it is up to them how much time to invest.)\u201cI lost the No. 1 spot, now I\u2019m No. 2,\u201d Mr. Jones said in early August, acknowledging that he checks his ranking frequently. \u201cI thought about researching to find out who it is \u2014 you always want to know who\u2019s the competition \u2014 but I said leave it.\u201dHe added: \u201cI\u2019m a competitive person. We just toggle back and forth. If they see me jump back in, they work harder. They want that spot back.\u201dMy flight to Bangor, Me., was due after 9 p.m., and apparently sensing my unease with the North Country, the firefighter seated next to me asked if I had far to drive when we landed. \u201cAbout three hours north,\u201d I confessed. \u201cWatch out for moose,\u201d he said. I assured him I\u2019d driven around deer before. He stopped me short: If you hit a deer, you\u2019ll kill them, he said. If you hit a moose, they\u2019ll kill you.I found Troy Carter, the agent who had recently surpassed Emmett Jones, at his home in Fort Fairfield the next day, wearing jeans, a button-down short-sleeve shirt, and a New England Patriots hat. There were no shoes on his feet, only white socks.Like Mr. Jones, Mr. Carter said Liveops had been a blessing, allowing him to earn a living in a part of Maine so remote that my cellphone carrier welcomed me to Canada shortly after I pulled into his driveway.\u201cThe real thing is the paid application rate \u2014 they want it around 95 percent,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cHe has 87 sales, but only 65 percent paid, compared to my 94 percent.\u201d This, he explained, was why he enjoyed the right to call himself the top agent for the month.Mr. Carter is what you might call a serial entrepreneur. He once started an art supply website that folded within a few months, and a penny auction site called Bid Tree that foundered for lack of a marketing budget.He sees Liveops, on which he spends 40 to 50 hours per week, as of a piece with these entrepreneurial efforts. In fact, it is something of a family business. His wife, Lori, handles incoming calls while he\u2019s busy with customers. \u201cI\u2019m a housewife/secretary/receptionist,\u201d she said. Even Mr. Carter\u2019s 9-year-old son, Logan, plays a role. \u201cAt nighttime, he says the last part of his prayer based on how many sales I did today,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cIf it was a lot of sales, he\u2019ll pray, \u2018Dear Lord, help my dad get the same amount of sales tomorrow.\u2019\u201dThough Liveops agents work from a script, Mr. Carter, like Mr. Jones, adds his own flourishes. Before asking a caller\u2019s gender, as he is required to do, he will say, \u201cNow I already know the answer to this question, but please confirm if you\u2019re male or female.\u201d Upon receiving the answer, he will pause momentarily before saying, \u201cI told you I already knew the answer,\u201d and break into a laugh.He might make this identical joke, with identical timing, dozens of times in a workday. \u201cIt\u2019s like a comedian has a little pause before a joke,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt relaxes them right off.\u201dEven with these touches, results can vary widely. Two days earlier, Mr. Carter had made seven sales, only a few shy of his record. The day I turned up, he managed only one. He said some callers had the impression they could receive $25,000 of insurance for $9.95 per month \u2014 the commercial mentions both figures \u2014 and begged off when Mr. Carter told them that their premiums would be substantially higher.But on this day he repeatedly ran up against the limits of his powers. Even those who remained interested after 10 or 15 minutes of painstaking back-and-forth often demurred when Mr. Carter asked them for payment information. \u201cThis one guy was outside in a wheelchair,\u201d Mr. Carter said of a caller who couldn\u2019t produce his credit card. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to go in and get it. I said, \u2018I\u2019m fine waiting,\u2019 but I can\u2019t push him.\u201dThese setbacks only seem to make Mr. Carter focus more. At one point, he made a swiping motion between his face and his headset with his index finger and middle finger. \u201cThey recommend that you keep the microphone two fingers away,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always doing that \u2014 checking that it\u2019s two fingers. I\u2019ll do that for the rest of my life.\u201dIt seemed, all in all, like a grueling way to make the slightly more than $30,000 that Mr. Carter estimates he takes in before taxes. \u201cThe good thing is he can take hours off,\u201d Lori told me. \u201cBut then he can lose his spot. It\u2019s always a fight for the top.\u201dI was reminded of the Alec Baldwin monologue from the movie \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross,\u201d except that the prize for having the most sales wouldn\u2019t be a Cadillac, it would be a set of steak knives, because the Liveops analytics team had calculated that agents would give nearly as much effort for a prize worth a small fraction of the cost.Of course, unlike the salesmen in that movie, the Liveops agents can\u2019t really be fired \u2014 the third prize \u2014 because they weren\u2019t employees to begin with.A while later, Mr. Carter described a recent initiative in which agents were promised a bonus if 95 percent of their collective sales were paid up front. \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t going to work as soon as they said it,\u201d he told me, because a handful of agents with low paid rates could ruin everyone else\u2019s chances.\u201cThey did do a pullover sweatshirt for the top two,\u201d he added, brightening. \u201cI was second, so that\u2019s coming.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Requests More Disaster Aid but Also Seeks Cuts as Deficits Rise", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House asked Congress on Friday for $44 billion in additional relief in response to this year\u2019s devastating hurricanes, but facing rising budget deficits and pushing a tax cut that could cost $1.5 trillion, the administration also suggested that lawmakers make spending cuts to offset disaster costs.Disaster relief costs are now approaching $100 billion, with more likely to come. And congressional leaders are eyeing a deal that would allow nondefense and military spending to burst through strict caps put in place in 2011, when Republican leaders made fiscal rectitude a central organizing principle.The latest disaster request seemed to indicate that deficit concerns may be rising, at least in the White House. Administration officials laid out a menu of options for budget cutting, totaling $59 billion, from small nicks like $8 million from a rural energy program to far larger options, such as $3.9 billion from student financial aid and $1 billion from transportation infrastructure funds.Some of those proposals were sure to raise eyebrows. To pay for hurricane reconstruction, the White House suggested cutting nearly $520 million from the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 flood control and coastal emergencies account, which the White House identified as excess money from Hurricane Sandy relief.But those suggestions were hardly strenuous: The president\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, wrote that \u201cthe administration believes it is prudent to offset new spending.\u201dIt was not lost on Democrats that the administration suggested offsetting the cost of disaster relief but has offered no such concern for the far larger cost of the proposed tax cuts.\u201cJust one day after pushing the House to pass a massive tax cut for corporations and the wealthy that would add $1.5 trillion to the debt, it is galling that the administration is requesting offsets in exchange for helping Americans rebuild their lives,\u201d said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cHolding vital recovery funding hostage to unrelated and often divisive spending debates is wrong, and only delays fulfillment of our obligation to help disaster victims.\u201dThe latest relief request was swiftly dismissed as inadequate. Even before the request had been officially released, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said his staff had advised him that it was \u201cwholly inadequate.\u201d\u201cAfter the outpouring of sympathy and the expressions of concern that we\u2019ve heard from the highest levels here in Washington, D.C., we\u2019ve continually been told to wait, wait, wait,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said.Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said on Friday that the Trump administration \u201cmust keep its repeated commitments\u201d to provide the necessary funding to help Texas recover from Harvey.He then offered a reminder: \u201cThe constitutional responsibility to appropriate funding resides with Congress.\u201dRepresentative John Culberson, Republican of Texas, deemed the request \u201cvery disappointing\u201d and \u201ccompletely inadequate,\u201d and said it showed a \u201ccomplete lack of understanding of the fundamental needs of Texans\u201d by the White House Office of Management and Budget.\u201cThankfully, Congress funds the government \u2014 not O.M.B.,\u201d Mr. Culberson said.Democrats, too, insisted that the White House request fell far short of what was needed.\u201cThis is a new low for this administration,\u201d the lawmakers said in a joint statement. \u201cEither they have forgotten about the thousands of American citizens who\u2019ve lost everything in the California fires, or they just don\u2019t care.\u201dSenator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, called the funding request \u201cwholly inadequate and downright insulting,\u201d saying it was particularly insufficient for Puerto Rico.Mr. Leahy said he had received requests for more than $180 billion in federal aid in response to Harvey, Irma and Maria.\u201cThis request doesn\u2019t come even close to meeting those needs,\u201d he said.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, defended the size of the request on Friday.\u201cI don\u2019t think $44 billion is a low amount,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did a thorough assessment, and that was completed, and this was the number that we put forward.\u201dLawmakers are already facing a swirl of issues when they return to the Capitol after Thanksgiving, on top of the tax effort.They will need to find a way to avoid a government shutdown in December. The current short-term spending measure expires Dec. 8, and they will need to pass a spending package by then \u2014 or another stopgap measure \u2014 to keep the government open.Before a spending package can be hammered out, congressional leaders are seeking a deal to raise the caps on the spending at their annual discretion that were imposed in 2011. Democrats are pushing to increase nondefense spending by as much as military spending is increased. Defense hawks are seeking a sizable increase in military spending, a position reiterated on Friday by the leaders of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, Senator John McCain of Arizona and Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, both Republicans.\u201cThis era of forcing our troops to do more with less must come to end,\u201d they said in a joint statement.Then there is the tax overhaul, which Republicans hope will become the first marquee legislative achievement of the Trump presidency.The overhaul could add as much as $1.5 trillion to federal budget deficits over a decade.Just before the House\u2019s tax bill passed on Thursday, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, practically taunted the fiscal conservatives who were about to vote for it.\u201cOh where oh where are the deficit hawks? Have you become extinct?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs there not one among you who understands what this does to the national debt?\u201dIn the Senate, the deficit looms as a major issue \u2014 not because many Republicans are talking about it, but because Republican leaders can afford to lose no more than two of their members, and a handful have expressed concerns about how the overhaul could pile up more debt.Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, is one.\u201cI remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy,\u201d he said last week.\u201cWe\u2019re $20 trillion in debt,\u201d Mr. Corker wrote, \u201cand it\u2019s party like there\u2019s no tomorrow time in Washington.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vary the Minimum Wage by Region?", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Jonathan Cowan and Jim Kessler\u2019s argument for a regionally tiered minimum wage is poor policy that would leave too many workers behind. The minimum wage rates they recommend \u2014 an average of $10.90 initially for most regions of the United States and just $9.25 in lower-cost parts of rural America \u2014 are far too low and would not reach $15 an hour until about 2032 for most of the United States, and 2041 in rural America (assuming 2 percent annual inflation).Our national economy therefore needs a strong and uniform national wage floor to lift workers across the country \u2014 and prevent a race to the bottom.PAUL K. SONN, NEW YORKThe writer is general counsel at the National Employment Law Project.To the Editor:Jonathan Cowan and Jim Kessler correctly identify a serious problem with the national minimum wage: The cost of living varies greatly depending on where you live. However, their proposal for different minimum wages in a country with \u201chundreds of different micro-economies\u201d is not only exceedingly complex but also avoids the fundamental question: Why have a minimum wage at all?ANDREW TERHUNE, PHILADELPHIATo the Editor:The interesting proposal by Jonathan Cowan and Jim Kessler misses an important point. Even in Oklahoma City, where a simple breakfast at a diner costs only $5.79, and in Fargo, N.D., where a dozen eggs costs only 93 cents, a wage of $15 an hour doesn\u2019t go very far. The system we have now is not very different from the reasonable but complicated system that Mr. Cowan and Mr. Kessler propose.We now have a national minimum wage, and cities and regions where costs are higher are free to set their minimums higher. We need a $15 federal minimum wage because $15 is the minimum that a worker anywhere in the country should be paid. Cities and regions where the cost of living is more expensive will still be free to set higher minimums.The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is a national disgrace. It was not sufficient when that rate was set in 2009. Doubling the minimum is right. And high-cost cities like New York and Seattle will want to go higher.RICHARD NOCHIMSON, BRONXAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Republican Tax on the Future", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialOf all the lies Republican lawmakers and President Trump tell about their tax bills, the biggest whopper is that these windfall tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy would generate so much growth that they would pay for themselves.The House and Senate tax bills probably would provide a tiny lift to the economy for a couple years \u2014 enough, supporters no doubt hope, for them to cynically claim success. It\u2019s what comes next that the G.O.P. glosses over: the addition of more than a trillion dollars to the federal debt in just 10 years. Far from paying for themselves, these cuts would leave a bill for several future generations to pay off.In other words, Republican leaders aren\u2019t just trying to transfer money from current middle-class and poor Americans to corporations and the very wealthy. They are also trying to transfer money from future middle-class and poor Americans to corporations and the very wealthy.In addition, these bills would create new incentives for businesses to move production offshore and increase the trade deficit, which will benefit foreign economies and hurt the very factory workers Mr. Trump claims to fight for.This expert consensus refutes the already thoroughly discredited arguments of supposed deficit hawks, like the House speaker, Paul Ryan, that the bills would energize the economy and make it more competitive globally.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fate of Stateless Rohingya Muslims Is in Antagonistic Hands", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHAH PORIR DWIP, Bangladesh \u2014 A skinny finger of water separates Bangladesh from Myanmar, and the other night a group of men sat on the Bangladeshi side, peering into the darkness, wondering what was left for them.The muddy camps just inside Bangladesh, where more than 600,000 Rohingya have since fled, provide no solution, either.Officials from Bangladesh, a very crowded country, insist that Myanmar must take the Rohingya back. But Myanmar\u2019s Buddhist majority drove them out in the first place, creating a climate of hate that vilified the Rohingya as subhuman. Many people in Myanmar insist the Rohingya are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, even though Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for hundreds of years.Few ethnic groups on earth have been locked into such hopeless logic, marooned on an international border, unwanted by either side, weary, traumatized, desperately stateless, their very origins in dispute.Many Rohingya now worry that without any input from them, their fate is being sealed. It is clear where most would stand if they were consulted.\u201cI will never go back to Myanmar,\u201d said an older Rohingya woman named Morjan who spends her days under a plastic sheet in a camp. After her husband and son were slaughtered in front of her, she fled to Bangladesh. \u201cBetter you kill us here,\u201d she said.Bangladeshi officials have circulated a draft repatriation agreement, specifying how to verify that Rohingya refugees, many of whom are illiterate and do not have a piece of paper to their name, are from Myanmar. The proposal talks of a \u201cfirst batch\u201d of returnees and even mentions logistics and transport.But Western aid officials said privately that this was a charade. The Rohingya would not be returning to Myanmar anytime soon, the aid officials said. But nobody was allowed to come out and say that, because it could alienate Bangladesh, which clearly does not want to host the refugees indefinitely but whose good will is needed right now.The violence is not even over. One Rohingya advocacy group said this week that Rohingya homes were still being burned to the ground.Each night here on the border, hundreds of Rohingya keep arriving in fleets of wooden boats that float silently across the mouth of the Naf River, the brackish waterway that separates the two countries.A group of New York Times journalists waited in the darkness alongside worried family members as a searchlight on the Myanmar side swung back and forth, back and forth, an eerie metronome moving across the gloom.Bangladesh now finds itself in an impossible situation. One of Asia\u2019s poorest countries, it is home to 160 million people \u2014 half the population of the United States \u2014 squeezed into a space the size of Iowa. The Rohingya refugees have taken over hillsides, chopped down countless trees to build their shelters and put such a stress on the economy of Bangladeshi border villages that prices have shot up threefold, angering longstanding residents.Facing international pressure to host the refugees and some domestic pressure to push them out, Bangladesh\u2019s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, has said that her country would continue to help the refugees on humanitarian grounds but that Myanmar must \u201ctake their nationals back.\u201dShe has ordered the army to seal off roads around the camps to make sure Rohingya do not start migrating to towns. Her government has also decreed that Rohingya were not allowed to work or register for local cellphone service.With no way to support themselves, the Rohingya refugees are completely dependent on aid. United Nations agencies such as the World Food Program have been feeding them, while international and Bangladeshi charities have provided medical care, plastic tarps, cooking pots and other basics.How long the Rohingya are expected to stay will affect the next set of issues, including questions like whether Bangladesh or outside groups should begin building schools for them.\u201cIf they stay where they are living now,\u201d said Anup Kumar Chakma, a retired Bangladeshi Army officer, \u201cthe entire area will become a fertile breeding ground.\u201dAnd not only fertile for terrorist recruiters, but also for human traffickers, criminal gangs, prostitution rings \u2014 anyone who preys on the vulnerable.For decades, the Rohingya have been pushed around this shoulder area of Asia where the Indian subcontinent and the Southeast Asian peninsula meet. Their lowly status and history of being demonized allowed this latest crisis to happen, analysts say.If the British had drawn the colonial border between what is now Myanmar and Bangladesh a little farther east and south, as Rohingya leaders had pleaded for after World War II, the biggest Rohingya areas would have been become part of Bangladesh. That would have made sense in several ways: the Rohingya are Muslim, like the vast majority of Bangladesh, and their language and culture are very similar.But scholars say that to appease the majority Buddhists and get out of Myanmar as quickly as possible, the British decided to follow the old borders of an extinct Buddhist kingdom. This kept the Rohingya inside Myanmar, where most people are very different ethnically and religiously from them.Myanmar\u2019s leaders steadily stripped away their rights, making it extremely difficult for Rohingya to get a government job or a passport, go to school or even be legally married. Government soldiers preyed upon them; revered Buddhist monks openly called them insects and snakes.All this, looking back on it, seems to have been building up to August, when the Rohingya suffered the most comprehensive assault on their existence.Many poured into Shah Porir Dwip, a border crossing and notorious smuggling den somewhat disguised by a collection of scruffy tea shops. It lies just across the water from Myanmar. The air smells heavy here, the odor of rotting fruit cutting through the salty breeze.Each evening, Rohingya men sit on a crumbled walkway near the beach, waiting for family members still trying to get out. By 9 p.m., the boats usually start arriving. Without a sound, they materialize from the murk, rowing in from the Myanmar side, engines off, for stealth.On a recent night, one of the heaviest, hundreds of Rohingya refugees splashed out. Many were quiet, and some wept as they waded ashore.It was difficult to tell which men had reunited with their families and which had to return to the camps alone.In the darkness, walking slowly up the beach, the group moved as one.Sergey Ponomarev contributed reporting from Shah Porir Dwip, and Julfikar Ali Manik and AKM Moinuddin from Dhaka, Bangladesh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Craves Electric Cars, While U.S. Flirts With Ending Tax Credit", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVolkswagen announced on Thursday that it planned to introduce to the Chinese market 25 models of electric cars between 2020 and 2025, in addition to the 15 electric models it already had planned to bring to the country by 2020. The company and its joint venture partners will invest almost $12 billion in the effort, said Jochem Heizmann, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group China.Mr. Heizmann said that most of the electric car models in VW\u2019s short-term product pipeline for China are based on existing designs for internal combustion engines. But a majority of the 25 additional electric car models will be created from the ground up as electric cars, he said, an approach that allows engineers to make very different design decisions to maximize energy efficiency and passenger comfort.Other foreign carmakers are also betting heavily on the electric vehicle market in China.G.M. said on Monday that it was weighing when to start a broader rollout of its Baojun E100 electric car after selling more than 4,000 in just one midsize city in southern China since July. Nissan is preparing to announce on Friday, at the opening of the Guangzhou auto show, that China will be one of the first markets in which it sells the new, battery-powered electric Leaf with a big nationwide sales push.\u201cIf you look at Detroit in the early 20th century, there were 250 carmakers, and that is pretty much what China has in electric vehicles now,\u201d said Tony Seba, the founder of Rethink X, an American energy and transportation consulting firm. \u201cThey are far ahead.\u201dAnd while the eventual ban on the traditional internal combustion engine is a longer-term goal, China is taking interim steps to promote electric vehicles.But Mr. Heizmann said on Thursday that even if China had not issued the regulations, its stringent fuel economy targets for 2020 could not be met without selling a lot of electric cars or halting the sale of all but the smallest gasoline-powered cars. The country will require each carmaker that year to sell cars with an overall average fuel economy of 47 miles per gallon.The contrast with the United States is stark.If the House and Senate measures both pass, a House-Senate committee would then decide whether to include a repeal of the tax credit in the final legislation.There are some differences between the American and Chinese fuel economy tests that make them not strictly comparable, however: The Chinese tests tend to show a slightly higher fuel economy for the same cars.Automakers are also moving the production of parts to China for electric cars. Reliant on very large batteries from South Korea for its electric cars, G.M. is now moving to buy many of its batteries from Chinese suppliers, said Matthew Tsien, the executive vice president who oversees G.M.\u2019s extensive China operations. That helps the company qualify for Chinese electric car subsidies that require considerable domestic content.\u201cWe do see China being, in the near and medium term at least, by far the largest market for electric vehicles in the world,\u201d Dan Ammann, G.M.\u2019s president, said in an interview in New York this week. \u201cBut we believe ultimately that the whole world will go that direction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

An industry has grown up around courting public-school decision makers, and tech companies are using a sophisticated playbook to reach them, The New York Times has found in a review of thousands of pages of Baltimore County school documents and in interviews with dozens of school officials, researchers, teachers, tech executives and parents.School leaders have become so central to sales that a few private firms will now, for fees that can climb into the tens of thousands of dollars, arrange meetings for vendors with school officials, on some occasions paying superintendents as consultants. Tech-backed organizations have also flown superintendents to conferences at resorts. And school leaders have evangelized company products to other districts.Tech companies have not gone as far as drug companies, which have regularly paid doctors to give speeches. But industry practices, like flying school officials to speak at events and taking school leaders to steak and sushi restaurants, merit examination, some experts say.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be paid by Big Pharma, or Big Ed Tech, to be influenced,\u201d Dr. Boyd said. She has raised concerns about the tech initiative at school board meetings.In a district riven by disparities, Dallas Dance, the superintendent from 2012 through this past summer, made an appealing argument for a tech makeover. To help students develop new-economy skills, he said, every school must provide an equitable digital learning environment \u2014 including giving every student the same device.\u201cWhy does a first grader need to have it?\u201d Mr. Dance said in an interview last year. \u201cIn order to break the silos of equity, you\u2019ve got to say that everyone gets it.\u201dThe district wanted a device that would work both for youngsters who couldn\u2019t yet type and for high schoolers. In early 2014, it chose a particularly complex machine, an HP laptop that converts to a tablet. That device ranked third out of four devices the district considered, according to the district\u2019s hardware evaluation forms, which The Times obtained. Over all, the HP device scored 27 on a 46-point scale. A Dell device ranked first at 34.The district's hardware evaluations for HP, Dell, Apple and Lenovo devices. The winning device: HP.Mychael Dickerson, a school district spokesman, said, \u201cThe device chosen was the one that was closely aligned to what was recommended by stakeholders.\u201d Daly did not respond to inquiries.With the laptop deal sealed, Silicon Valley kicked into gear.In September 2014, shortly after the first schools received laptops, HP invited the superintendent to give a keynote speech at a major education conference in New York City. Soon after, Gus Schmedlen, HP\u2019s vice president for worldwide education, described the event at a school board meeting.\u201cWe had to pick one group, one group to present what was the best education technology plan in the world for the last academic year,\u201d Mr. Schmedlen said. \u201cAnd guess whose it was? Baltimore County Public Schools!\u201dAn HP spokesman said the company did not pay for the trip. He said the company does not provide \u201ccompensation, meals, travel or other perks to school administrators or any other public sector officials.\u201dRecently, parents and teachers have reported problems with the HP devices, including batteries falling out and keyboard tiles becoming detached. HP has discontinued the Elitebook Revolve.Mr. Dickerson, the district spokesman, said there was not \u201ca widespread issue with damaged devices.\u201dAn HP spokesman said: \u201cWhile the Revolve is no longer on the market, it would be factually inaccurate to suggest that\u2019s related to product quality.\u201dAsked what device would eventually replace the Revolve in the schools, the district said it was asking vendors for proposals.A Baltimore County school board member, David Uhlfelder, said a representative from the Office of the Maryland State Prosecutor had interviewed him in September about Mr. Dance\u2019s relationship with a former school vendor (a company not in the tech industry).The prosecutor\u2019s office declined to confirm or deny its interest in Mr. Dance.Mr. Dance, who discussed the district\u2019s tech initiatives with a Times reporter last year, did not respond to repeated emails and phone calls this week seeking comment.Mr. Dance\u2019s travel schedule sheds light on that world.Between March 2014, when the laptop contract was announced, and April 2017, when he announced his resignation, Mr. Dance took at least 65 out-of-state trips related to the district\u2019s tech initiatives or involving industry-funded groups, according to a Times analysis of travel documents obtained under public records laws \u2014 nearly two trips per month on average. Those trips cost more than $33,000. The Times counted only trips with local receipts, indicating Mr. Dance set foot in the cities.At least $13,000 of Mr. Dance\u2019s airline tickets, hotel bills, meals and other fees were paid for by organizations sponsored by tech companies, some of which were school vendors, The Times found. The $13,000 is an incomplete number, because some groups cover superintendents\u2019 costs directly, which means school records may not include them.Another way tech companies reach superintendents is to pay private businesses that set up conferences or small-group meetings with them. Superintendents nationwide have attended these events.ERDI offered several service levels this year, according to a membership rate card obtained by The Times. A $13,000 fee for Bronze membership entitles a company to one confidential meeting, where executives can meet with five school leaders to discuss products and school needs. Diamond members could pay $66,000 for six such meetings.The Education Research and Development Institute, known as ERDI, charges membership fees to school vendors to arrange small-group meetings with superintendents who can provide product feedback.\u201cBecause we are asking for their time and expertise, we commonly offer to pay the cost of their food, transportation and lodging during their participation,\u201d ERDI\u2019s president, David M. Sundstrom, said in an email.Mr. Dance\u2019s calendar indicated that he had attended at least five ERDI events.Mr. Dance received payment last year as an adviser for ERDI, according to his most recent district financial disclosure. It lists Dulle Enterprises, a company that owned ERDI in the past, as an employer from which he earned income.Last February, at an ERDI conference in New Orleans, Mr. Dance met with Curriculum Associates, which makes reading software, as well as DreamBox Learning, a math platform.A DreamBox spokeswoman said there was no connection between the meeting and its contract. \u201cEven the appearance of impropriety is something we take very seriously and take steps to avoid,\u201d she said.A Curriculum Associates spokeswoman said: \u201cThese panels are not sales presentations, but rather focus-group opportunities to solicit feedback on products under development.\u201dMs. White, the interim superintendent, has been involved with ERDI since 2013, according to Mr. Dickerson. He said Ms. White used vacation time to attend events, where she \u201cprovided guidance to education-related companies on goods, services and products that are in development to benefit student performance.\u201dAsked whether Ms. White had received ERDI payments, Mr. Dickerson said, \u201cParticipation in ERDI is done independently of the school system.\u201d In an email, Ms. White said she found ERDI to be a \u201cbeneficial professional learning experience.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond to a question about ERDI compensation.She added, \u201cI do not believe there are any conflicts of interests\u201d related to the district\u2019s tech initiative.Mr. Sundstrom, ERDI\u2019s president, said education companies pay a fee to attend events \u201cnot to meet school leaders or make a sale,\u201d but to get meaningful feedback on their education products from knowledgeable school leaders. He added that school officials do not make purchases at ERDI sessions and that it is their school boards that approve district purchases.Baltimore County\u2019s travel rules say, \u201cNo travel expenses will be paid by those seeking to do business with the Baltimore County Public Schools prior to obtaining a contract.\u201d Mr. Dickerson explained that applied to companies currently bidding for contracts.\u201cYou have these huge contracts, and then you donate all this money, and the foundation puts up a banner advertising your company\u2019s name,\u201d said Michael J. Collins, a former Maryland state senator and former school board member. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think that passed the smell test.\u201dDiscovery Education said it trained employees to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Microsoft said its policies followed government gift and ethics rules. Pearson said its donation had been nominal and vetted to prevent conflict of interest. McGraw-Hill said it was committed to integrity and transparency.When asked if the foundation had policies governing donations from vendors or potential vendors, Ms. Phelps said no. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s not necessarily a policy,\u201d she said. There is also no policy prohibiting foundation board members who are vendors from reviewing grants involving their or competitors\u2019 products, she said.Mr. Dickerson said the focus of Baltimore County Public Schools was on \u201csupporting students, teachers and their learning environments.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are unapologetic for engaging with our Education Foundation, business partners and community stakeholders in an effort to close known achievement gaps.\u201dMr. Reich of Stanford suggested school districts establish clearer rules governing their relationships with vendors, particularly with tech companies racing to win over the gatekeepers to America\u2019s classrooms. Otherwise, parents could lose trust in the system.\u201cSchool leaders should be just as concerned about the perception of corruption as actual corruption,\u201d he said.Lilia Chang contributed reporting from Washington, and Jeremy Merrill from New York.

{"Headline": "A Strongman Nicknamed \u2018Crocodile\u2019 Is Poised to Replace Mugabe", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn firing Mr. Mnangagwa, Mr. Mugabe \u2014 Zimbabwe\u2019s leader since independence in 1980 and, at 93, the world\u2019s oldest head of state \u2014 might have finally overreached, singling out an erstwhile ally with liberation-war credentials and a deep power base of his own.By the time of Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s dismissal, the enmity between the vice president and Mrs. Mugabe had spilled into the open. He accused her of trying to kill him with poisoned ice cream from her dairy farm, an allegation she denied.But many see the takeover as a symptom of the infighting and generational divide roiling the governing party, ZANU-PF, rather than a genuine chance at multiparty democracy and economic reform.There is also fear about his association with some of the Mugabe era\u2019s low points: Mr. Mnangagwa was accused of orchestrating a crackdown in the 1980s in which thousands of members of the Ndebele ethnic group were killed. He was an avid supporter of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s most controversial economic policy \u2014 the expropriation and redistribution of land that had been controlled by white farmers since the era of colonialism. He was also accused of being behind deadly violence in 2008 a bid to rig polls in favor of Mr. Mugabe, a claim he denies.Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa was born on Sept. 15, 1942, in Zvishavane, a mining town, the child of politically active farmers.His father was steeped in the resistance movement against white settlers, and his political activism forced the family to flee to present-day Zambia. \u201cHe was born into politics,\u201d said Victor Matemadanda, secretary general of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Association, who served under Mr. Mnangagwa in the military.Expelled from school for his activism, Mr. Mnangagwa joined the movement to liberate what was then Rhodesia, a British colony, from white rule. He received military training in China and Egypt.At 16, he was part of a plot to blow up a railway line. His accomplices were summarily executed, but a priest appealed to the British to spare him on account of his age. He was instead given a 10-year sentence in prison, where he devoted himself to study. After his release, earned a law degree from the University of Zambia.He soon left the legal practice to join the liberation movement in Mozambique, then a Portuguese colony, where he met Mr. Mugabe and became his personal assistant and bodyguard. He was a commander during the war for independence in the 1970s. He was at Mr. Mugabe\u2019s side when the white-led government entered into political negotiations that resulted in the birth of Zimbabwe in 1980.Mr. Mugabe rewarded Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s loyalty by elevating him to different posts. At various points of his career, he was minister of justice and defense, minister for rural housing and speaker of Parliament, among other positions.In recent years, Mr. Mnangagwa has tried to reform his checkered past, styling himself an advocate of agricultural reform and a proponent of efforts to restore Zimbabwe\u2019s relationship with outside investors and international institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\u201cIt is not for nothing that he is known as Ngwenya,\u201d said Mr. Fabricius, the journalist, using the Xhosa word for crocodile.\u201cHe didn\u2019t ride off into the sunset to launch yet another opposition party, or just retire from politics to make even more money, as many had expected,\u201d Mr. Fabricius said.The relationship with the Mugabes began to sour this year, after Mrs. Mugabe began to make an increasingly open bid to succeed her husband. She accused him of plotting a coup, and he accused her of trying to kill him.Although the latest military action was set off by his firing, reports are emerging that it had been planned several weeks earlier, with senior military officers consulting South African and Chinese officials.The origins of the nickname Crocodile are not clear. Some say it was Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s nom de guerre during the liberation struggle; others say it is derived from his family name.In a phone interview, Mr. Matemadanda, the military veteran, elaborated on the nickname.\u201cA crocodile patiently waits for his target, pretending to be a rock,\u201d he said. \u201cAt times you think he doesn\u2019t react, or doesn\u2019t have any solution to what is happening. He doesn\u2019t show irritation until the optimal moment and then he strikes. And when he does, he doesn\u2019t miss his target.\u201d\u201cEveryone who gets into politics knows that the moment you join you don\u2019t join to be the last name, you join with the hope that you\u2019ll come out first,\u201d he added. Regarding the latest developments, after a long career, Mr. Mnangagwa \u201chas been patient for a very long time.\u201dAs his commander, Mr. Matemadanda said Mr. Mnangagwa was \u201cone of the most polite, tolerant, very down-to-earth persons that I have ever met.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re watching how the Justice Department might be trying to negotiate some sort of concession from AT&T and Time Warner. More on that in a moment.Now that the House has released its tax overhaul bill, the plainly named \u201cTax Cut and Jobs Act,\u201d expect more and more opposition from groups that stand to lose. That includes businesses from across the spectrum.Here are some groups that would be disadvantaged by provisions of the legislation, at least in its current form:Expect no small amount of lobbying from those businesses \u2014 and from lawmakers in high-tax states, who continue to demand more favorable deductions for state and local taxes.Behind the Broadcom moveOne of the few surprises from yesterday was the announcement that Broadcom \u2014 the chip maker built from a series of acquisitions over the past decade \u2014 plans to relocate its legal headquarters to Delaware from Singapore. While the move isn\u2019t dependent on the tax bill going through, Hock Tan, Broadcom\u2019s famously reticent C.E.O., publicly told President Trump at a news conference: \u201cThanks to you, Mr. President, business conditions have steadily improved.\u201dAT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner is a vertical merger that doesn\u2019t lead to consolidation within one particular industry, leaving few legal options. Mr. Trump has publicly opposed the merger, but the Justice Department\u2019s new antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has said that he won\u2019t let politics sway his decision-making.But other than Andrew Liveris of DowDuPont, it appears that none of the corporate leaders who served on any of the now-disbanded presidential councils is going. G.E., which had a seat on the president\u2019s manufacturing council when Jeff Immelt was C.E.O., is sending a lower-level executive.Mr. Trump is bringing 29 chief executives to Beijing, where the administration hopes to announce billions of dollars of new deals for American industry. But officials are playing down expectations that China will agree to any meaningful opening of its markets.But as social media has become increasingly connected to unpleasant bickering, race-baiting and Russian propaganda, the must-have \u201csocial\u201d label has become an albatross, said Joseph Bayer, an assistant professor at Ohio State University who focuses on social networks.Part of the reason is that, by spreading untruth and outrage, corroding voters\u2019 judgment and aggravating partisanship, social media erode the conditions for the horse-trading that Crick thought fosters liberty.More on Russian meddlingElsewhere in techThe planned departure of Mr. Mercer as Renaissance Technologies\u2019 co-chief executive has come amid protests aimed at university endowments, foundations and pension funds with money invested in the hedge fund.[David] Randall of the Baltimore retirement fund compared the decision to redeem money from Renaissance to the decision of whether to invest in a tobacco company or gun manufacturer. He said Renaissance is one of the fund\u2019s best performing investments.Others are staying put with Renaissance. Michigan State University\u2019s endowment has no plans to withdraw its $50 million, for example.Don\u2019t expect Mr. Mercer to withdraw from conservative politicsDespite trying to distance himself from Steve Bannon (by selling his investment in Breitbart to his daughters) and its former technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos, Mr. Mercer will remain a big financier for conservative causes, The NYT added.\u201cThis seems to me much more like Robert Mercer separating \u2026 his image from his moneymaking capacity than an actual disassociation with the people he funded for so long,\u201d said Ben Shapiro, the former editor-at-large at Breitbart who broke with the site in 2016. \u201cYou hear about this and you have to wonder what else they were spending money on.

Her son, however, kept losing weight \u2014 first a little, then a lot. \u201cIt was a dark time for me,\u201d she said.After getting conflicting advice from experts, Ms. Halsall, a Chicago native who was living in San Francisco with her fianc\u00e9e, then did what many frustrated new mothers do these days. She turned to Google.\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized I was a second-class citizen in the eyes of the internet,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to download an app for breast-feeding, and they were all clearly made by men, and they were all horrible.\u201dEighty-two percent of children born each year are born to millennial mothers. That\u2019s five out of every six babies. And their parents \u2014 let\u2019s call them \u201cparennials\u201d \u2014 are challenging all sorts of commonly held beliefs about the American family.Let\u2019s examine their innovations one at a time.\u201cThe good news is that parents know more about child development than ever before,\u201d she said. \u201cGoogle is the new grandparent, the new neighbor, the new nanny.\u201dThe bad news is that parents feel overwhelmed by the volume of information, confused about the \u201cright way\u201d to do things and harshly judged by friends and relatives.Kate Flynn, 32, lives in Brooklyn with her 11-month-old daughter, Isla, and her college sweetheart, Michael. Like many new parents, she felt unprepared for the responsibility. \u201cWe feel like kids who aren\u2019t old enough to have kids,\u201d she said.\u201cI\u2019ll be on the phone with my mom and say, \u2018The app is telling me that she is starting her 9-month sleep progression,\u2019\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cI just found out that Wonder Weeks only goes to when the child is one. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s liberating or scary.\u201dMany parennials, accustomed to chronicling every fab appetizer and every failed job interview, give their children YouTube channels from the first sonogram and hashtags when they\u2019re born.\u201cI knew I wanted to name her Bryn, but when considering middle names, there were a couple of \u2018A\u2019 names we were thinking about. We chose Bryn Avery because I could get the Twitter handle @BrynAvery,\u201d Ms. Mauskopf said.Others, like Kassandra Ortiz, 26, a stay-at-home mother of two in Brooklyn, are warier. After being stalked online by a classmate who posted her photo along with comments about what he wanted to do to her, Ms. Ortiz considers herself \u201coverly protective\u201d of her children.\u201cI like taking pictures of my kids walking away, so I avoid showing their faces,\u201d Ms. Ortiz said. \u201cI have this fear that if I post a picture on Instagram, then my child will become a meme.\u201d\u201cFor 30 years we\u2019ve been asking, \u2018Can women have it all?\u2019\u201d Mr. Harrington said. \u201cNow we\u2019re asking if men can have it all.\u201dGabe Wells, 33, a loan officer, was born in Iowa and moved to Portland, Ore., with his wife, Caitlin, who was his girlfriend at the time. When she became pregnant, the two went through a \u201crough patch,\u201d he said, and went into counseling.\u201cThe No. 1 thing I learned is that my language changed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t say \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018father\u2019 anymore. I say \u2018co-parent.\u2019 It sounds odd to people in the Midwest, but it\u2019s more reflective of what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201dThey realize 50-50 is \u201ca pipe dream,\u201d he said. \u201cBut If we can trade off going 60-40, that\u2019s great.\u201dCo-parenting does come with downsides. Ms. Parlakian of Zero to Three said she\u2019s begun to detect a new theme in her annual surveys of parents. She calls it \u201cgate-keeping,\u201d when the less-involved parent tries to step up but the primary parent slaps the partner down, saying \u201cYou did it the wrong way\u201d or \u201cWhy did you put the baby in that?\u201d\u201cGiven the statement \u2018I would like to be more involved with raising my child but my parenting partner interferes with my involvement,\u2019 nearly half the dads agree,\u201d Ms. Parlakian said, \u201cwhile only 16 percent of moms do.\u201dFrom her experience running Winnie, Ms. Halsall has concluded that \u201cmillennial dads are different than their elders, in that they see it as a positive masculine trait to be involved with their children,\u201d she said.\u201cThe idea that women are more proactively issuing feedback to their co-parents that are male to me sounds very encouraging. It\u2019s an indication that they see each other as partners.\u201dNew parents of all ages often face money woes, but with parennials these challenges can feel particularly acute because they reached childbearing age during the Great Recession, are saddled with college debt and are perhaps job-hopping or part of the gig economy.As a result, many parennials rely on their own baby boomer parents for financial support. Ms. Ortiz has started a photography business on the side while her husband, who hopes to get into real estate, drives for Uber. To make ends meet, they get financial help with rent from her mother-in-law.\u201cMoney has always been an issue, but we do our best and hope God will provide,\u201d Ms. Ortiz said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a millennial thing, but we spend so much money eating out. We\u2019d be better off if we didn\u2019t.\u201dJess Laird, 31, grew up in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan with parents who were \u201cbroke actors,\u201d she said, so she\u2019s used to money struggles. She was working full-time when she had her first child at 29, but wanted to spend more time with her daughter. Since then, she has worked at a start-up that went out of business and now freelances remotely. She is still paying off her undergraduate loans, and her husband, Morgan, is doing the same with his law school debt.With so much financial pressure, they rely on her mother for child care.\u201cOther moms I talk to who are 35 or 40 seem to be more settled financially,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels weird when I say, \u2018My mom is taking care of my kid.\u2019 I even use the word \u2018mother\u2019 because it sounds more adult.\u201dGender roles are not the only thing being challenged by parennials; other social norms are experiencing upheaval as well. Pew has found that almost four in 10 Americans married since 2010 have a spouse who is a different religious group, double the number from 1960. Nine in 10 millennials approve of interracial marriage or cross-cultural marriage.The disdain of Andrew Moore, 33, and his wife, Rachel, 31, for religion has caused friction with his family, who were missionaries. \u201cMy mom just doesn\u2019t talk about it,\u201d said Mr. Moore, a physical scientist who is the father of Harrison, 2. \u201cMy father asked me, not long after I told him I was nonreligious, whether I would raise my children Christian. I was, like, \u2018No, man, I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019\u201dThe one thing they\u2019re teaching him, he said, is \u201cSome people get value from religion, and he might, too, as long as he realizes that what\u2019s good for him might not be great for another.\u201dThis sense of fluidity, of improvisation, of \u201cmaking it work\u201d in the words of one couple, or \u201cgetting by\u201d in the words of another, appears to be an early, unifying theme of millennial parents. Maybe it\u2019s their uncertain economic status, their sense of experimentation, or simply the times they grew up in, but many parennials seem less rigid than their elders.\u201cI thought we were supposed to do things a certain way,\u201d said Ms. Flynn of Brooklyn, who had multiple jobs and multiple apartments when she was in her 20s. \u201cHave the career, the house, the green grass, and then the kid. But that didn\u2019t happen. My life has a different plan.\u201cHaving a kid when things are unstable like this,\u201d she said, \u201cfeels like a start-up. We kind of know where we are going with this, but we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to turn out.\u201dA previous version of this article misspelled the given name of Sara Mauskopf\u2019s daughter.

{"Headline": "The Clash of Social Visions", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery tax plan is a social vision and a statement of values. The social vision embedded in the House Republican tax plan is straightforward: to take money away from affluent professionals in blue states and to pump up corporations as the engine for broad economic growth.Or to put it more bluntly, Republicans think the whole country would be better off if we take money away from the Democrats\u2019 rich people and give it to their own (more productive) rich people.Second, the Republican plan cuts the deduction for state and local taxes. In 2014, according to The Economist, nearly 90 percent of the benefit from this deduction flowed to those making more than $100,000 a year. Once again, this tax hike hits mostly those in high-tax blue states.Third, the bill taxes investment income earned by private universities with at least 500 students and assets not directly tied to educational objectives of more than $100,000 per student. It imposes a 20 percent excise tax on nonprofit executives who make more than $1 million.This is the beginning of the full-bore Republican assault on the private universities, which are seen as the power centers of blue America \u2014 rich, money-hoarding institutions that widen inequality and house radical left-wing ideologies.Fourth, the bill preserves high top marginal tax rates on individual income and even raises rates in some cases on the very rich. Over the past few decades when Republicans have talked about tax reform, they have generally talked about sharply cutting the top marginal rate to 25 percent or even 15 percent. But this plan keeps the top rate at 39.6 percent. And then it throws in some peculiarities. As The Wall Street Journal noted, under the plan a married couple would face a 45.6 percent top rate on earnings between $1.2 million and $1.6 million.Republicans would take the revenue from these tax hikes (and much more) and they would use it to lighten the load borne by corporations.None of this is to say that the Republican plan is worth supporting. I personally oppose it because of the way it explodes the deficits. Second, the level of largess to corporate shareholders is frankly ridiculous. It piles one corporate tax cut on top of another like piling a chocolate sundae on top of chocolate cake on top of a Toblerone bar.This is not a column about the workability or advisability of this or that plan. This is a column about the sort of social vision that serves as a predicate for that plan.The Republicans have a social vision. The Republican vision is that the corporate sector is more important to a healthy America than the professional and nonprofit sector. The Republican vision is that companies that thrive in the red states, like manufacturing and agriculture, are more important for the country than the industries that thrive in blue states, like finance, media, the academy and the movies.What, by contrast, is the Democratic vision? Are Democrats going to spend the next few months defending the mortgage interest deduction and other tax breaks for their own rich?It could be that economic policy is becoming tribal just like everything else in our politics. In that world, parties use their time in power to nakedly shift the tax code for the benefit of their own donors.It would be nice if our tax code wasn\u2019t red or blue but distinguished between social goods and social bads. I\u2019d love to see a tax code that rewarded investment and discouraged consumption. That would mean cutting taxes on earnings but raising revenue through a progressive consumption tax. I\u2019d love to see a tax code that punished pollution but encouraged social cohesion. That would mean taxing carbon but increasing tax credits for working people and families with children.You may or may not like my vision, but it\u2019s more elevated than the visions that are now emerging, which are a dressed-up version of the spoils system: more money for my political friends and less for my political foes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is Wealth?", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGivingInterviews have been edited and condensed.Wealth is about community, good health and service to others for Rachel Talton. Ms. Talton, 52, is founder of the Flourish Conference for Women in Leadership, and chief executive of Synergy Marketing Strategy & Research in Akron, Ohio.\u201cI know we are blessed financially because we have the freedom to do the things that we want not only today but tomorrow,\u201d said Ms. Talton, who lives with her husband in the suburb of Richfield.As a little girl, Ms. Talton knew she wanted to help people, and yearned to be a psychiatrist. In college, she realized she \u201cmight not become the scientist I wanted to be\u201d but had a way with words, and switched to marketing. She ultimately earned a doctorate at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.Financial success doesn\u2019t guarantee happiness, she said, but it provides a kind of freedom.\u201cWealth means loving what you do and the contributions that you make,\u201d Ms. Talton said. \u201cIt means being able to be financially free to do the things you love, to live the way you want to live. But it also means being healthy, and to know that your family and the ones you care about are healthy and spiritually whole, and that they\u2019re contributing.For Kyle Webb, 32, wealth is about opportunity and access. His financial and business success came from two places: One was luck and the other was being born to entrepreneurially minded parents.Mr. Webb is the chief financial officer of his family\u2019s business, Webb Family Enterprises, which operates 16 McDonald\u2019s franchises in Southern California.He said that his parents set him up with his first McDonald\u2019s franchise and that, along with a good education \u2014 a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration from Morehouse College and an M.B.A. from the University of Southern California \u2014 set him on his track. Webb says he is not quite what he would call wealthy yet, but he has a clear view of what that will be.\u201cHaving the financial freedom to contribute to the things that you want to contribute,\u201d Mr. Webb said. \u201cThat\u2019s measured by earning twice the income that is required to sustain your cost of living via passive income.\u201dHe said that wealth \u201cprovides access to more,\u201d and that it should extend for \u201cfuture generations to be able to have, again, more access and more opportunities and to be able to extend it to other people whether they are in your familial line or if there are opportunities for other people in your community that you feel warrant opportunity.\u201dWealth has enabled Daniel Buss, 69, an orthopedic surgeon in Minneapolis, to adopt five children, which cost more than $250,000 in total, and address their special needs, including a string of out-of-state cleft lip and palate operations and specialized tutoring for dyslexia.It allows him to take off work for extended family vacations and for most of the children\u2019s school breaks. \u201cTaking more time off puts us in a position where we can get them up to speed on life,\u201d Dr. Buss said.\u201cHaving excess income allows me to be more involved with my family and more involved in my community,\u201d he added.With that comes a sense of perspective. \u201cI probably make 10 times a year what my dad made as a small farmer in southern Minnesota,\u201d Dr. Buss said. \u201cEvery time I look around, it sort of hits you: Boy, am I fortunate to have had the education I got and then the opportunities after that.\u201dMeanwhile, wealth mutes the late-night worries that nag many parents, he said. \u201cIt gives me some peace of mind that I\u2019m going to have resources \u2014 next week, next month, next year.\u201dStill, Dr. Buss said he did not consider affluence to be paramount. Rather, it sweetens a life that is already rich.When Nedim Ramic thinks of wealth, the first thing that comes to mind is health.\u201cIf you\u2019re a healthy person, you are already wealthy,\u201d said Mr. Ramic, 35, at his home in St. Louis\u2019 southern suburbs. \u201cThe reason I say this is, as you can see with a lot of these refugees, a lot of them were really, really wealthy. They had a lot of money and had a lot of material things, and it just all gets wiped away. And all of them had to start from scratch somewhere else.\u201dIt\u2019s a story that resonates with Mr. Ramic, a Bosnian Muslim whose family fled genocide in his native Bosnia and Herzegovina when he was 10. His hometown, home to 12,000 people when war broke out, sits on the border with Serbia. The family escaped to Germany in 1992 and resettled in St. Louis in 1999 \u2014 starting over from nothing.\u201cIf you have your health, if you have your life, you can accomplish pretty much anything if you get the right mind-set,\u201d he said.Mr. Ramic went on to finish law school at St. Louis University and became an American citizen. In 2008, he passed the Missouri Bar Exam and the United States citizenship test the same week. He is now a personal injury attorney and maintains several investment properties.\u201cMaterial aspect of wealth is very important, because everything else is much easier to plan around if you are financially stable,\u201d he said.Mr. Ramic and his wife had their firstborn \u2014 a son \u2014 just last year.Wealth is many different things, said Darrin Williams, 49, chief executive of Southern Bancorp Inc.\u201cFor me it is an accumulation of assets, and when I use the term assets they don\u2019t necessarily have to be financial,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people can be wealthy in a number of ways. I am wealthy in that I have a loving family and that makes me happy, more happy than money.\u201d\u201cWhen I think of wealth I really go back to my family,\u201d said Mr. Williams, a lawyer and former state legislator. \u201cI think of what my wife and I will be able to leave our children and our grandchildren, and that\u2019s much further beyond just income and money and possessions, but that\u2019s also wisdom, that\u2019s also advice and a strong faith foundation. I think all of those things make you wealthy. You can be very wealthy and not have a lot of money.\u201dMr. Williams said Southern Bancorp, a Community Development Financial Institution, worked in some of the most impoverished regions of the country to help people break the cycle of generational poverty through employment, homeownership and savings. \u201cWe believe that wealth building isn\u2019t just for the wealthy,\u201d he said.After an impoverished childhood, Hattie Hill, a consultant, author and women\u2019s professional group leader, had to learn the lessons of wealth.\u201cWe were in survival mode,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cThe transition from scarce resources to financial security was and continues to be a challenge. It\u2019s always about choices.\u201dMs. Hill is president and chief executive of the Women\u2019s Foodservice Forum, which promotes women\u2019s advancement in the food industry. She also writes books and maintains a global speaking and consulting schedule.\u201cWealth covers the necessities of life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt covers the wholeness of families. It\u2019s also about making a difference in the community, whether it\u2019s supporting faith-based organizations or women and girls.\u201dShe is drawn to initiatives with values. \u201cThat\u2019s important as a woman trying to make a difference in the world \u2014 to promote women and girls, sustaining and developing your community,\u201d she said.Jen Kimmich was waiting tables and managing at a Burlington, Vt., pub when she fell in love with its young, blue-eyed brewmaster. She and John Kimmich married and started saving for their own brewpub.Those were lean times. The experience of struggling on service wages stuck with them even as their Alchemist Pub and Brewery in Waterbury, Vt., started to make money.\u201cJohn and I lived with our son in an 1,100-square-foot condominium until 2013,\u201d said Ms. Kimmich, who is now 45. \u201cWe always had used cars, always bought clothing from the sale rack. We still live well within our means. We like to go out to eat and take nice trips. We know what\u2019s important to us and what we value.\u201dTropical Storm Irene destroyed the pub in 2011, just as the Kimmiches started a small production plant nearby.\u201cThe reality is, while money doesn\u2019t make you happy, it does give you freedom to not worry about those financial stresses,\u201d Ms. Kimmich said.Last year, they opened an $11 million second brewing plant and tasting room in Stowe, and they now employ a total of 45 people at both breweries. They installed a wastewater capturing system to minimize pollution and set up a charitable arm that supports educational and work-force development programs.The week before Zach Strief was born, his father was fired from his job as an electrical engineer. His father immediately started his own company, Control Works Inc., which he built and eventually employed 49 people.Mr. Strief, 34 \u2014 an offensive tackle for the New Orleans Saints and a partner in Port Orleans Brewery in the Irish Channel neighborhood of New Orleans \u2014 said he was raised upper class in Milford, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati, and \u201chad no wants as a kid.\u201d\u201cMy dad worked 16 hours a day building his company,\u201d he said. \u201cI watched him a lot and learned the value of hard work.\u201dHe said he had learned over time \u201cthat wealth is an advantage that gives you an opportunity to provide for your family. It does not eliminate problems. It does not create eternal peace of mind. It creates other stresses. But if you don\u2019t have money \u2014 it\u2019s an immediate stress.\u201dHe was a union representative for four years, and one of the things he saw a lot was that people can\u2019t understand how a player can make so much money and lose it all. \u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d he said.\u201cSpending and taking care of money is a skill \u2014 not everybody has that skill,\u201d he said. He added that when you hand $500,000 to a 22-year-old who has grown up in a family without much money, there is no comprehension of how to deal with it.Sabina Teshler was born in Russia and lived in Israel, Italy, New Zealand and Brooklyn before moving to Portland, Ore., and starting her own company there. She now lives just across the Columbia River in Vancouver, Wash.\u201cGrowing up, we didn\u2019t have a lot of money,\u201d Ms. Teshler said. \u201cMy father taught us hard working ethics and to always put family first. I never went to college; I started my career working for my brother in advertising and learned everything through my different clients, working at different agencies and self-teaching. Coming from that background, wealth is something you share with people.\u201dShe said wealth had done two things for her. \u201cOn the business side, it created an opportunity,\u201d she said, \u201callowing me to bring in great talent to my company and help the economy in Portland. When you start a company, it\u2019s because you\u2019re passionate about it and you see an opportunity- the wealth comes after.\u201dOn the personal side, she said, it is about having more security and giving more to those you love.Anuj Peddada and his family immigrated to the United States from India when he was 6, and he remembers the sparseness of those early years. \u201cWe really had nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in poverty.\u201dMr. Peddada, 53, works as a radiation oncologist at the Penrose Cancer Center in Colorado Springs. With more than 22 years of practice under his belt, he is at the top of his field.\u201cIt\u2019s the freedom to have some choices,\u201d he said, explaining what wealth has meant to him. \u201cIt means you have the luxury of being able to provide for your family and determine how much work you want to do.\u201dMr. Peddada works a lot. On his days off, he pores over medical journals for hours, breaking in the afternoon for a mountain-biking venture with his son \u2013 a hobby Mr. Peddada says his wife and daughter are too smart to pursue.But, added Mr. Peddada, who treats cancers and brain tumors, the reading doesn\u2019t feel like work. \u201cMy job is a calling.

{"Headline": "\u2018Mugabe Must Go\u2019: Thousands in Zimbabwe Rally Against Leader", "Date": "2017-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans gathered in the capital on Saturday, hooting, whistling and hugging soldiers as they called for President Robert Mugabe to give up power, days after the military placed him under house arrest.In scenes perhaps unthinkable only weeks ago, people marched side by side with members of the military \u2014 who rode in armed tanks \u2014 and the protesters hailed the army as setting them free from Mr. Mugabe\u2019s 37-year autocratic rule.\u201cMugabe must go, and his goons must leave. We have been victimized by Mugabe for too long,\u201d said Nigel Mukwena, a 24-year-old student of political science at the University of Zimbabwe.Others took selfies of the military at the rally, which converged on Zimbabwe Grounds, known as the site of addresses by Mr. Mugabe and other icons of the nation\u2019s liberation. The scenes, and the celebratory air, were a seminal shift for the country\u2019s 93-year-old leader \u2014 Africa\u2019s oldest.For some Africans, Mr. Mugabe remains a nationalist hero, a symbol of the struggle to throw off the legacy of colonial rule. But he was also reviled as a dictator who resorted to violence to retain power and ran a once-robust economy into the ground.On Friday evening, a majority of the leaders of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s governing ZANU-PF party, which he had controlled with an iron grip since independence in 1980, recommended his expulsion, according to ZBC, the state broadcaster.\u201cMany of us had watched with pain as the party and government were being reduced to the personal property of a few infiltrators with traitorous histories and questionable commitment to the people of Zimbabwe,\u201d the party leaders said in a resolution. \u201cClearly, the country was going down the wrong path.\u201dA nephew of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s, Patrick Zhuwao, told Reuters on Saturday that the president and his wife were \u201cready to die for what is correct\u201d and had no intention of stepping down. Speaking from South Africa, Mr. Zhuwao was quoted as saying that Mr. Mugabe had hardly slept since the military seized power, but that his health was otherwise \u201cgood.\u201dOn Saturday morning, Zimbabweans \u2014 some chanting, \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d and carrying signs emblazoned with \u201cMugabe must go\u201d \u2014 marched alongside soldiers in tanks mounted with machine guns.For many Zimbabweans, the atmosphere was electric and filled with hope. Marchers swarmed to the grounds, and drivers honked their horns. At one point, military aircraft streaked above the crowds. Later, demonstrators marched toward Mr. Mugabe\u2019s residence in the exclusive Borrowdale suburb of Harare, where he was believed to be held in military custody.Benita Mudondo, 57, came to the rally from the Nyanga District, more than 180 miles to the east, near the border with Mozambique. \u201cSurely Zimbabwe, our country, is back \u2014 the one country we fought for,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had given up, but had become worried about the future of our children and grandchildren.\u201dHer husband, Ernst Mudondo, 67, a war veteran, said, \u201cOur joy only starts today, and we are so happy.\u201dTheir daughter, Michelle Mudondo, 17, added: \u201cWe want to see our country on a path back to recovery; I look forward to a stable government with a stable economy without shortages of cash.\u201dEconomic opportunity was cited by others. \u201cI am here because I want a job, and Mugabe couldn\u2019t deliver,\u201d said Simbarashe Sakuona, 23, who said he had a degree in marketing from Midlands State University. \u201cWe were witnessing a bedroom coup as Grace now called the shots. Grace can\u2019t be a leader.\u201dMr. Zuma said on Saturday that his country was committed to supporting \u201cthe people of Zimbabwe,\u201d according to Reuters. He added that he was cautiously optimistic that the situation could be resolved amicably.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Open Thread: This Week in Style News", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpen ThreadGreetings from rainy Belgium, where I have spent the last week, first at the New York Times International Luxury Conference in Brussels, and then at the Fashion Talks lecture series in Antwerp.People don\u2019t generally think of Belgium as a fashion center, but the country has produced some of the most influential designers in modern fashion: Martin Margiela, Ann Demeulemeester, Dries Van Noten, Raf Simons, Olivier Theyskens, Haider Ackermann. Given that Belgium is roughly the size of Maryland, that\u2019s pretty striking.Maybe there\u2019s something in the waffles?Certainly the physical aspects of the country \u2014 the art nouveau buildings, the sepia tones, the lush gardens \u2014 have their own aesthetic. We tend to undervalue the importance of geography for designers, but it matters.I once asked Dries why he stayed in Antwerp, since he shows in Paris, and he said the distance from the fashion world, with all its neuroses, provided invaluable perspective.And speaking of a different perspective, here\u2019s a tidbit from the NYT conference that changed mine. Bill McDonough, an architect and the co-author of Cradle to Cradle, a book about the circular economy, was talking about the word \u201csustainability,\u201d and pointed out that it was a weirdly unexciting term to use for a hugely positive initiative. What would you think, he observed, if you asked someone how their marriage was, and they answered, \u201csustainable\u201d?Bet you\u2019d think what I thought: We need a new word.(He also pointed out that we put a man on the moon before we figured out that wheels on suitcases were a good idea, but that\u2019s a whole other discussion.)So, in no particular order, my top five items to which one should Just Say No:1. Bloomers. Amelia Bloomer was indubitably a great pioneer, but at this stage these blouson shorts generally call to mind children\u2019s wear or Shakespearian costume, and neither is good for everyday adult dressing. Indeed, I generally stay away from all kinds of shorts unless used for athletic endeavors or hiking on the weekend in hot places.2. Onesies. Similar reason. These are for babies. Let the babies have them.3. Hobble skirts. You know: the straight cuts that angle inward at the knee or ankle and trap the legs so the only way to walk is with mincing, tiny steps. No woman should be hampered in her stride by these (see Amelia Bloomer).4. Kitten heels. The name says it all.5. Mules. Ditto. Also, if your shoes flap, it is very hard to be taken seriously. And the naked heel is maybe everyone\u2019s worst body part.Finally, an extra tip: stay away from anything with an obvious temporal association: Michael Jackson gloves, \u201cDesperately Seeking Susan\u201d lace, Elvis glitter. It\u2019s the fashion equivalent of carbon dating. \u2014 VANESSA FRIEDMANAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Navigating a Breathtaking Level of Global Economic Change", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cConfidence\u201d is a curious word. It is derived, in part, from the Latin word \u201cfides\u201d which translates to \u201cfaith.\u201d It is a feeling, an inner voice.Just reading the headlines over the past year of what has seemed like a steady parade of crises and potential crises \u2014 North Korea, Russian interference in elections in the United States, post-Brexit Europe, hurricane damage \u2014 you\u2019d think that any sense of \u201cfaith\u201d in the global economy might be shaken, or at least, uncertain.Not so.In conversation after conversation with some of the nation\u2019s top business leaders and chief executives last week, there is a stunning amount of genuine \u201cconfidence\u201d in our economy here and, yes, even globally.\u201cI\u2019m very surprised,\u201d Laurence D. Fink, the founder of BlackRock, the largest money manager in the world overseeing some $6 trillion, said at The New York Times DealBook conference last Thursday, describing his new sense of optimism.\u201cIf you\u2019d asked me a year ago how would you feel, I would\u2019ve told you I\u2019ve got concerns in this region and that region,\u201d he said, making a list. \u201cA year-and-a-half ago we were worried about China,\u201d he added. \u201cA year ago I would\u2019ve said I\u2019m very worried about the eurozone stability,\u201d both of which are now outperforming. \u201cAnd then the other surprise is how robust the U.S. economy is \u2014 how strong corporate profits are. I would say that\u2019s my biggest surprise, how robust corporate profitability is, even with a quite dysfunctional Washington.\u201dPresident Trump, of course, has made a habit of taking credit for the growing economy and stock market returns. \u201cThe reason our stock market is so successful is because of me,\u201d the president said aboard Air Force One last week. \u201cI\u2019ve always been great with money, I\u2019ve always been great with jobs, that\u2019s what I do.\u201dWhether he deserves credit is, being charitable to him, up for debate. But what\u2019s absolutely true is that if the global economy \u2014 and stock market \u2014 is a confidence game, confidence is clearly winning.Mark Cuban, whose disdain for President Trump is so acute that he is considering running for president himself in 2020 as a Republican because it \u201cmeans you get to go head-on with Trump right in the primaries \u2014 and so there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d have more fun doing.\u201d Still, though, he said he believes the economy is in good enough shape that when it comes to investing in the stock market, \u201cI just, you know, I just let it ride.\u201dMr. Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said he keeps a small amount of cash on hand as a precaution. \u201cI keep a little bit, you know, as a hedge. I call it my \u2018Trump hedge\u2019 because you just never know. Now 280 characters can change the market in a heartbeat,\u201d he said, not-so-jokingly alluding to the new character limit on Twitter, Mr. Trump\u2019s communication tool of choice.Still, merger activity, which this column has long argued is the purest measure of confidence \u2014 since most executives only do deals when they are genuinely confident in their own business and the economic environment \u2014 has reached a record high. It bolted in the past several months after what seemed like a surprisingly lackluster beginning of the year as executives appeared to be paralyzed by a sense of uncertainty, trying to gauge the first steps of a new president.It appears that chief executives have found themselves certain that whatever \u201cuncertainty\u201d exists isn\u2019t that uncertain after all.Still, there are pockets of the economy that are causing anxiety. \u201cThe last two or three years have not been fun whatsoever,\u201d Mickey Drexler, the chairman of J. Crew, said at the conference about the traditional retail business, which has been upended by Amazon and changes in consumer behavior. \u201cIt\u2019s been miserable.\u201d Those challenges are extending to mall owners and commercial real estate, too.The question is whether all the enthusiastic talk from chief executives is reflective of a truly robust economy or whether we are missing something.\u201cThere\u2019s so many people talking about the record level of the stock market. The stock market is not a proxy for the economy of America,\u201d said Howard Schultz, executive chairman of Starbucks. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about the millions of Americans who are not participating in the economy.\u201dThat may be worth remembering. If there is a lesson in having confidence, especially when everyone else is feeling that way, it is that it can quickly reverse.\u201cIn the aftermath of corporate and public-sector disasters, it often emerges that participants fell prey to a collective form of willful blindness and overconfidence: mounting warning signals were systematically cast aside or met with denial, evidence avoided or selectively reinterpreted, dissenters shunned,\u201d Roland B\u00e9nabou a professor at Princeton University wrote in a seminal work on confidence and groupthink. \u201cMarket bubbles and manias exhibit the same pattern of investors acting \u2019colorblind in a sea of red flags,\u2019 followed by a crash.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retailers\u2019 Recipe for the Holidays: Big Sales; Fewer Seasonal Workers", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter 14 years of staying home to raise her family, Melanie Colon landed a job for the holidays at a Target store in Queens, selling toys, bedsheets and linens. She hopes it will lead to a full-time position.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about getting back into the work force,\u201d she said.Ms. Colon, 36, is part of an army of temporary retail workers who are hired every year to help with the holiday shopping crush.Holiday hiring gives the economy an annual jolt, raising the incomes of hundreds of thousands of families at Christmas time and offering people like Ms. Colon a chance to make some income, even if only for a few months.But like so much about the retail industry, holiday hiring is in flux, even as stores are poised for a big shopping season. While some large retailers like Target are making a big push, others are hiring fewer temporary workers \u2014 or almost none at all.Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer and private employer, has no plans for a hiring spree this holiday season. Instead, the company said it was giving \u201cmillions more\u201d hours to its thousands of part-time employees, many of whom rely on Walmart as their only job.Across the country, retailers are expected to hire from 500,000 to 550,000 seasonal workers this holiday, down from the roughly 575,000 who were hired last year, according to the National Retail Federation.The decline reflects the forces buffeting the retail industry and the broader economy.With more sales moving to the internet, many brick-and-mortar stores are seeing less foot traffic, which means they need fewer workers manning the aisles. Retailers are also on pace to close thousands of stores this year.\u201cThe industry is going through a transformation,\u201d said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation.The sharp decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has created a tight job market, so fewer Americans need temporary work. With profits under pressure, the last thing that retailers want to do is to get into a bidding war for workers by substantially raising wages.The shifts are evident at Macy\u2019s. The retailer is synonymous with the holiday season, but there is little to cheer about on 34th Street this year.Nearly a quarter of those temporary workers, about 18,000, will be working in fulfillment centers across the country, in places like Goodyear, Ariz., and Martinsburg, W.Va.Macy\u2019s is trying to stem the flow of sales to Amazon by pushing an \u201comni-channel\u201d strategy meant to be all things to all shoppers: a helpful and engaging shopping experience in stores, an alluring website and quick home delivery.It is a tall order that requires big investments. And, as if sensing weakness, Amazon is ratcheting up the pressure.The online-retail giant is hiring 120,000 seasonal workers, many of whom will pick, pack and ship boxes this Christmas. That is on top of the roughly 50,000 permanent workers it added at its fulfillment centers this fall.Conditions suggest that this will be a robust shopping season. Unemployment is low, consumer confidence is high and the stock market has been booming.As a result, holiday sales are projected to increase by as much as 4 percent from a year ago, to $682 billion, according to the National Retail Federation.\u201cThis is as good as it gets,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cIf they can\u2019t survive in this environment, it is hard to imagine they will be around for very long.\u201dHoliday hiring will be an important factor for retailers trying to impress, or, in some cases, win back shoppers.Bringing on too few workers could produce disheveled shelves and long lines \u2014 and sour shoppers even further on brick-and-mortar stores.Executives at Walmart said the decision to forgo adding thousands of seasonal workers was made partly because so many store employees, including those working part time, having been trained in how to navigate new technologies, like hand-held devices for pricing goods and tracking inventory. Training temporary workers on these systems, only to let them go after a few months, would be inefficient.\u201cThis is the same approach we took last year, and we heard great feedback from our customers and associates,\u201d Walmart\u2019s chief operating officer, Judith McKenna, said in a statement.In the end, it is unclear how many additional hours Walmart workers can expect. The company is known as an industry leader in managing costs.Cynthia Murray, a founder of Our Walmart, a labor group, said she had heard from workers who had had their hours reduced in recent weeks, a move she thought was designed to lower costs before the holiday crunch.Staffing in the retail industry is often elastic and tends to mirror consumers\u2019 shopping habits. Many retailers cut back workers\u2019 hours when traffic to stores dies down, including in the fall, before the holidays arrive.\u201cDuring the holiday season, we have millions more hours available than we do during any other time of the year,\u201d a Walmart spokesman said in a statement. \u201cAnd for the second year in a row, we\u2019ve made the decision to give as many of those hours as possible to current full- and part-time associates.\u2019\u2019Among large retailers, Target is making perhaps the biggest holiday hiring splash.The company plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers, up from 70,000 last year, as it makes a push to improve the shopping experience in its stores and grab market share from some of its struggling rivals.In addition to hiring so many seasonal workers, the company said it was raising its starting wage to at least $11 an hour.Ms. Colon, the seasonal worker at the Target in Queens, said she saw an ad seeking holiday help on the retailer\u2019s website. Personally, she does much of her shopping online, but she thinks the stores are important.\u201cI have people come in and say \u2018I am buying this for my sister or I am buying this for my girlfriend,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey want my opinion. You don\u2019t get that online.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Sun Never Set on the British Empire, or Its Food", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionRecently in our household it was stir-up Sunday, the invariably chilly late autumn afternoon when all gather in the kitchen to give the last ritual touches to the making of this year\u2019s Christmas pudding. The fragrant, brandy-soaked mess of fruits will have been readied in its great earthenware bowl, to be steamed in the Aga\u2019s lower oven for 12 full hours. But before then everyone will place a firm hand on the big wooden spoon and together give the mixture a ceremonial last turn, always east to west in honor of the wise men coming to Bethlehem, to add a final dash of quite another kind of spirituality to the booze-sodden ingredients.The old cookbooks \u2014 as Lizzie Collingham reminds us in her joyously delicious account of Britain\u2019s gastronomic influence on the world \u2014 employed Christmas recipes like this to offer children a geography lesson. The currants, we were told, were Australian, the raisins from South Africa, the suet from New Zealand. Demerara sugar was shipped in from Barbados, the eggs came from chickens in the Irish Free State. The cinnamon was from Ceylon, the cloves from Zanzibar. There was Malayan nutmeg, Cypriot brandy, Jamaican rum. Only the bread crumbs, the flour and the porter came from home, from England.My mother would buy all these ingredients each Christmas season, invariably at the closest thing to a supermarket in the London suburb where I grew up \u2014 which was called, appropriately, The Home and Colonial. It was one of a chain of grocery stores so familiarly central to English life of the 1950s that it came to be memorialized in poetry. John Betjeman, known for his sentimental odes to the ordinary, wrote of his Welsh sylph Myfanwy with a still-remembered stanza: \u201cSmooth down the Avenue glitters the bicycle,/ Black-stockinged legs under navy blue serge/ Home and Colonial, Star, International,/ Balancing bicycle leant on the verge.\u201d Few here in America could imagine the Safeway or the Piggly Wiggly to be deserving of such verse or such sentiment.Neither do many see romance in the origins of these foods, nor of their passage across the ocean. Except for Kipling, of course: \u201cOh, where are you going to, all you Big Steamers, / With England\u2019s own coal, up and down the salt seas?\u201d / \u201cWe are going to fetch you your bread and your butter, / Your beef, pork, and mutton, eggs, apples, and cheese.\u201d / \u201cAnd where will you fetch it from, all you Big Steamers? / And where shall I write you when you are away?\u201d / \u201cWe fetch it from Melbourne, Quebec, and Vancouver \u2014 / Address us at Hobart, Hong-Kong, and Bombay.\u201dAnd so we learn much from such matters as the 17th-century churning of butter between the thighs of a half-naked Irishwoman in Connaught; from the weekly budget of a 19th-century New Zealand farm laborer; from a tea party in a Manchester slum as described in an Elizabeth Gaskell novel; and from a British infantryman\u2019s diet in the North African desert during World War II \u2014 gooseberry jam preferred to strawberry, Egyptian sweet potatoes cordially loathed, as were the bully beef from the Fray Bentos canning factory in Argentina and the hardtack from Carr\u2019s of Carlisle. From such lavish depictions we derive with infinite pleasure a pointilliste picture of the world\u2019s food economy in all its magical complexity.Many of the book\u2019s portraits are charming, and some are especially important in their reach. \u201cFreshly bathed, Kamala set about preparing her family\u2019s evening meal,\u201d Collingham writes of an Indian family living near Patna in 1811. \u201cFirst she smoothed fresh cow dung in a circle to define a purified cooking space and sprinkled it with a few drops of water. Then she took some of the chillies she had plucked from the plants that grew near the family\u2019s hut and cast them on the grinding stone with a few drops of safflower oil, made from the seeds of the thistle-like plants that formed a picturesque hedge surrounding their plot of land.\u201d As is characteristic of the book, there is rather more to this particular sojourn in India than one might initially suppose, and as the context will eventually make clear.For it has been a conceit of some historians to make a connection between seemingly unconnected phenomena, like the consumption of tea and the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan. The linkage goes like this: So beloved was tea back in Britain that the East India Company ran out of silver bars to pay the currency-suspicious Cantonese and instead plied them with India-made opium; the Chinese Empire went to war to stop this grubby trade in what they called \u201cforeign mud\u201d; it lost and was forced to cede Hong Kong to Britain; a thus-weakened China was then first nibbled at, then serially gnawed into further humiliating submission by Russia, France, Germany, America \u2014 and Japan, newly open to the outside world. Japan acquired a liking for easy imperial adventure, decided unwisely to attack Pearl Harbor, whereupon America responded with sustained might \u2014 and lo!, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were eventually and cruelly laid waste.There are precious few Kamalas \u2014 indeed, precious few quotidian details of ordinary life \u2014 in Erika Rappaport\u2019s sturdy \u201cA Thirst for Empire,\u201d in which she tells with authority how tea and the culture of tea drinking has influenced the greater history of the British Empire and the British-influenced world beyond. Despite being a somewhat drier work than Collingham\u2019s, it is nonetheless fascinating: Rappaport\u2019s description of the ways in which tea has been marketed over the years is entirely absorbing, especially for an academic audience.When news like that accumulates, only one thing can soothe the English soul \u2014 and that is to reach for \u201cthe cup that cheers.\u201d But in making it, be sure to bring the pot to the kettle and not the kettle to the pot. I suspect even the Netherlanders who run Unilever know how to make a decent cuppa these days. Which is rather more, I regret to say to my new-made compatriots, than they do here in America.Simon Winchester\u2019s \u201cThe Perfectionists: A Brief History of Precision\u201d will be published in May.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The \u2018Lion King\u2019 Effect: How a Broadway Smash Changed South African Lives", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "Over 20 years, hundreds of performers have joined the show in cities around the globe. These are some of their stories \u2014 laced with hope, tragedy, homesickness and triumph.Supported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Fumane Moeketsi bent her knees into a crouch, threw her hands up in the air, and tore into the opening notes of a musical she has never seen.It was the fourth time in five years that Ms. Moeketsi, the deep-voiced 23-year-old daughter of a platinum miner from a tiny village in South Africa\u2019s Eastern Cape, had tried out to play Rafiki, the oracular mandrill, in \u201cThe Lion King.\u201dFinally, on the last day of May, Ms. Moeketsi found herself in front of a row of folding tables occupied by \u201cThe Lion King\u201d global brain trust, including the show\u2019s award-winning director, Julie Taymor, and, hovering anxiously along a wall, Duma Ndlovu, the South African casting consultant.\u201cNants\u2019 ngonyama,\u201d she belted out, silencing the room with the Zulu lyric that has become the show\u2019s signature sound. \u201cBakithi baba.\u201dOver the last two decades, 263 South Africans, many with little formal training in singing or acting, have been dispatched all over the planet to \u201cLion King\u201d productions staged in Dutch, English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese and Spanish. Ms. Moeketsi was determined to be next.According to Disney, the musical \u2014 about Simba, a lion cub finding his way after the death of his father \u2014 has earned more money than any other title in entertainment history. Since opening on Broadway in 1997, it has been seen by 90 million people in 24 productions that have collectively grossed $7.9 billion.Adapted from a hit animated film set in the fictional Pride Lands, the stage adaptation is rooted in South Africa by its music, much of it by the composer Lebo M., using South African languages and choral stylings. Almost every cast \u2014 and there have been many \u2014 has included eight to 12 South Africans among approximately 50 performers.\u201cI felt very strongly that we had to have South Africans in it from the beginning,\u201d Ms. Taymor said in Durban in June. She was there for a round of auditions, which continued through the summer, to assemble a largely South African-cast tour that will begin in Manila next March and then set out across Asia.This month the show celebrated its 20th anniversary. When Ms. Taymor and Thomas Schumacher, the president of Disney\u2019s theatrical division, were developing it two decades ago, they helped persuade Actors\u2019 Equity to allow for a contingent of South African performers; now every year Disney teams visit Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town to cast more. \u201cIt\u2019s like the spiritual foundation of \u2018The Lion King\u2019,\u201d Ms. Taymor said.The life is hard \u2014 performers, generally young adults, leave their parents, and often their children, behind, often relocating to countries where they don\u2019t speak the language. But there is adventure to be had, art to be made, money to be earned.That\u2019s why Ms. Moeketsi, who grew up in a home without electricity, listening to news on a battery-powered radio and hoping to one day become an announcer, started auditioning.She had moved from her village to Johannesburg for college, and, as she wrapped up her studies at the University of the Witwatersrand, she saw \u201cThe Lion King\u201d as her best hope, professionally and financially.She was seeking to join a generation of South African performers who have landed jobs in the musical. Some have found new homes, new families, new careers. Others have struggled to translate the opportunity into sustained success.All have been changed.The gangster\u2019s wife is worried.Brenda Mhlongo is seated on a plush couch in a television studio, rehearsing her reproachful stare while a makeup artist touches up her face. At the same time she and a language adviser on headset are quibbling about how best to phrase \u201cWhere is your shirt?\u201d in Zulu.It\u2019s a long way from Pride Rock.Ms. Mhlongo, 38, is a \u201cLion King\u201d success story \u2014 a grateful alumna who parlayed a stint with Disney into a significant television career back home. She now stars on \u201cGenerations: The Legacy,\u201d South Africa\u2019s second-most popular soap opera, or soapie, playing a nurse married to a mobster.Along the way she faced years of unemployment and a spiritual crisis. But her journey illustrates the possibilities for \u201cLion King\u201d performers who spend years on stage overseas and then try to continue working in the arts back home.\u201cI knew I would come back, because I wanted to make my name in South Africa,\u201d Ms. Mhlongo said. Filming was over; breathless after a quick wig-and-costume change, she apologized that her typically fashionable character had been dressed casually for the late-night living room scene.While there she had another stroke of good fortune: She was spotted by a vacationing Disney executive who recruited her to join the \u201cLion King\u201d production that has been running in Germany for 16 years.But Ms. Mhlongo only lasted three months in Hamburg, before she left the show, citing \u201cspiritual sickness.\u201dRafiki is the one principal part regularly played by a South African woman. Inspired by a sangoma, a type of South African faith healer who, according to belief, can channel ancestral spirits, the character was troublesome for Ms. Mhlongo, as it has been for other South African women, because she felt at times unable to manage dark feelings she believed the ancestors were surfacing. (Some productions keep sage and other herbs on hand as antidotes.)She recovered \u2014 \u201cI had to fast and pray, and at home they had to do a lot of ceremonies\u201d \u2014 and her career resumed. She performed in the ensemble, while understudying Rafiki, in Johannesburg and on Broadway, and then played the role on tour in North America.The show spoke to her, and to other performers, in inspirational ways \u2014 in particular, its story of a dispossessed leader spending years in exile before returning to reclaim his kingdom strikes many as having thematic echoes of Nelson Mandela.The show also resonates personally and painfully. As the lionesses ululated in mourning over the death of Simba\u2019s father, Mufasa, Ms. Mhlongo would think of her own father, who was stabbed to death in Johannesburg when she was 13. \u201cWhen I listen to the eulogy, it\u2019s like I\u2019m talking to my ancestors. I\u2019m saying, \u2018Why, why did you take him?\u2019 \u2019\u2019The peak, she said, was originating Rafiki in Spain when that production opened in 2011. The transition was jarring: there was the night her brain froze and she accidentally began a song in German. But the gig went well, and she even won some awards for the yearlong engagement. \u201cAfter that I told them, I\u2019ve reached the ceiling,\u201d she said.She returned to South Africa in 2012, and, other than a brief 2013 fill-in stint in a North American tour, has been here since. \u201cI struggled to find work when I came back,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was hard to crack.\u201dShe now encourages other \u201cLion King\u201d hopefuls, in part by helping her husband, Edmund Mhlongo, whose K-Cap program, independent from Disney, prepares high school graduates to audition for \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d as well as more generally for careers in the arts.Students there all know whether their vocal range and body type make them more likely to be a Nala or a Rafiki, a Simba or a Mufasa, and each year they learn the audition songs, which they perform a cappella, in English, although Zulu is their primary language.Over the years, about 20 alumni have landed roles in the musical. For Ms. Mhlongo, whose face is painted on the side of the center alongside those of others trained there, the show offers a rare chance to explore the world, and the arts.\u201c\u2018Lion King\u2019 is a university,\u201d she said.The house \u201cThe Lion King\u201d built is gone.Thandazile Soni, the first Rafiki in Chicago, now lives in a wooden shack on a former sugar cane field southwest of Durban, down a rutted dirt path that descends as the houses become ever more ramshackle.Hers is the shabbiest \u2014 a makeshift three-room shed, with a corrugated metal roof held in place by stones, curtains to keep out critters and climate, cocks crowing and children playing in the dirt yard.There are no beds for the kids, and only a hot plate for cooking. When it rains, the structure floods; when the wind blows, everyone shivers; and when the sun beats down on that roof, they sweat.This is not the life Ms. Soni dreamed of. Not the life she worked for. Not the life she had.She has been in \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d off and on, since she was 25. Now she\u2019s 43.Ms. Soni, who goes by the nickname Thandi, was, in effect, a migrant worker in the global economy. She traveled around the world to work for Disney, moving so often she can\u2019t remember all the cities, leaving behind children to be raised by relatives, wiring money back to support as many family members as she can.She struggled, physically and psychologically. But now she wants back in, for a simple reason \u2014 her family needs the money.\u201cI just want to save like there\u2019s no tomorrow and then come back home and build for my kids,\u201d she said.She was seated on a twin bed in the tiny room she shares with her 10-year-old son; a jaunty straw hat sat atop her head. Pausing repeatedly to look away, catch her breath and wipe her eyes, she described herself as humbled and humiliated: \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to see how on earth did everything get to this point, but trying to look back is not going to fix it.\u201dShe left the show in the summer of 2016, hoping to take care of a college-age son who had had some kind of psychotic break while she was away. But she quickly lost a house she had purchased with her early earnings, and they wound up moving into the shack.Most of her belongings are now in storage, but just below her journal, she keeps a copy of the script and the score. Just in case.Her life story, as she tells it, is one of unrelenting woe.Raped at 10 by a neighbor, she gave birth to a child who was given to another family. A runaway at 14, she led a life she doesn\u2019t like to detail. \u201cIt was bad for a girl child,\u201d she said, rolling up her pants to show scars on her legs from a South African bullwhip called a sjambok.She was raised during the height of the struggle against apartheid, as repression and protest convulsed the country and severely limited the rights and opportunities for black South Africans. But she always had one escape \u2014 music \u2014 and she perked up as she recalled discovering that people admired her voice.\u201cI would find every chance I got to run away from home, go sing somewhere,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I would come back, they would beat me up a little bit, but then I\u2019d be fine, cause I did my thing.\u201dThe casting directors kept her for hours. Could she sing higher? Lower? Be Rafiki? Nala?Then her life changed. \u201cDo you have a passport?\u201d Lebo M., the composer, asked her. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what a passport was,\u201d she recalled.She was off to Denver, in the ensemble of a new national tour, and then a year later to Chicago, as Rafiki. She told her mother to buy that new house, and paid tuition for her siblings.But she also struggled, with depression, and with vocal issues. She worked in London, Hong Kong, and back on the North American tour. She had a baby (her fourth, cared for by her mother when Ms. Soni is away). She lost her voice again. She cycled in and out of the show.\u201cAt night I tell myself, this is our waiting area, this is where we are waiting to go to our Canaan,\u201d she said, waving her hand around the home she likens to a tomato box. \u201cI want to get out so bad.\u201dSo last spring she was back in a rehearsal room near Durban, auditioning again.The Disney team had a whispered conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive turnaround, given what she\u2019s been through,\u201d said Anthony Lyn, a supervising resident director for the show.Ms. Taymor was obviously moved. \u201cI love her,\u201d she told her team. \u201cI think she is amazing.\u201dAnd now, unable to make ends meet without \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d Ms. Soni is going back out on the road. She didn\u2019t get a role in the new international tour, but she did get an offer to join the ensemble in Scheveningen, a North Sea resort in the Netherlands.She is studying \u201cCircle of Life\u201d once again \u2014 this time in Dutch.Mduduzi Madela has been two kinds of antelope, an ostrich, half a wildebeest, half a rhino, and one leg of an elephant. He has sung bass, baritone and tenor. He has played a menacing hyena, and a leonine prince.For 14 years, since he was a scrawny 21-year-old, he has been crisscrossing America and Europe in \u201cThe Lion King.\u201dNow he\u2019s on Broadway, covering the role of Simba, which means that he periodically gets to perform a leading role. He is one of 36 South Africans who have made it to the Broadway cast over the last two decades; one ensemble member, Lindiwe Dlamini, has been with the show from the beginning.But what lies ahead for a South African artist who has spent his entire adult life on Pride Rock? Ms. Mhlongo found fame. Ms. Soni found hardship. Mr. Madela, who uses the nickname Mdu, is wondering what he\u2019ll find.\u201cAlready, I\u2019m itching,\u201d he said in June in Umlazi, the Durban-area township where he grew up, during a two-month leave from Broadway. \u201cWhat next?\u201dHe has a dream: he wants to be a music producer. He also has Ananelwe, his 2-year-old daughter \u2014 an American citizen, born of his relationship with another \u201cLion King\u201d ensemble member, Nteliseng Nkhela \u2014 and he knows the child\u2019s life will be affected by where they choose to live.Early this month, he found himself talking about constructing a post-show life with a group of \u201cLion King\u201d alumni after a boisterous 20th anniversary performance that brought Elton John, one of the show\u2019s composers, back to its stage.This spring, Mr. Madela brought Ananelwe with him to Umlazi, and arranged for a Zulu ceremony, introducing her to her extended family and, symbolically, to her ancestors; she received a goatskin bracelet, called an isiphandla, that she wears around her wrist.\u201cThis is what I wanted her to experience \u2014 being barefoot, somewhere in Umlazi, without being in an apartment in West New York, N. J., where there\u2019s no yard to play at, and we have to say, \u2018No, don\u2019t jump that much, because there\u2019s a neighbor underneath who\u2019s going to complain about the noise\u2019,\u201d he said.He imagines dividing his time between the two countries, aware that many alumni of the show don\u2019t return to South Africa, but also mindful of opportunities in the United States.\u201cWhen it comes to stability, and earnings, you get to do things that normal people do \u2014 you purchase a house, you take your kids to good schools \u2014 the very things that people aspire to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut \u2018The Lion King\u2019 gets the cream of the crop when it comes to singing, and many people wind up staying where they are.\u201dMr. Madela took to music early. His father, a production manager for a French electronics company, had a guitar, which he taught himself to play. His aunt gave him a keyboard; he learned that too. He wrote his first song at 12 \u2014 a love song, in Zulu \u2014 and then, under the tutelage of a high school teacher, he began reading about the songwriters Diane Warren and David Foster, and writing his own pop songs, now in English.\u201cThe only thing I knew about \u2018The Lion King\u2019 was the movie,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a musical.\u201dBut he was young, and adventurous, so when he saw an ad in a local newspaper, he auditioned, and then when a woman with a thick Dutch accent who could not pronounce his name called to offer him a job in Scheveningen, he said yes. His studies could wait.Paris, Las Vegas, the North American tour, the British tour. He saw the world. He learned to dance. He became fluent in a language he thought he would never learn \u2014 French.Finally, New York called. Broadway.\u201cI thought, \u2018You know what? You have to be a fool to say no,\u2019 \u201d he said.That was four years ago. To fend off restlessness, he takes classes and writes pop, gospel and R&B songs, and he has registered a company in the United States to publish and license his material, mostly in South Africa.\u201cIt\u2019s been such a beautiful, beautiful ride, and I\u2019m grateful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I look at my daughter, and I think, I need to do more.\u201dFumane Moeketsi, the 23-year-old university student who auditioned this spring, grew up on folk tales, filled with songs about hunters and giants and bears, told by relatives gathered in her family\u2019s rural home.So when she first heard Mr. Ndlovu, the South Africa-based casting consultant, explaining the story of a lion cub exiled after his father is killed by his uncle, she was smitten: \u201cI want to do it,\u201d she said.So she auditioned. And auditioned. And auditioned. This year, her fourth, was the first time she met Ms. Taymor, and she had 12 minutes to make an impression, to sell herself as a possible Rafiki.She was nervous \u2014 sweat beading on her forehead \u2014 but ready, beaming and forceful as she began. When she sang in African languages \u2014 the show\u2019s lyrics include words in Congolese, Sotho, Swahili, Tswana, Xhosa and Zulu \u2014 her voice was clear and sharp. But in English, her voice seemed to tremble. She rolled her R\u2019s. Her enunciation seemed effortful.\u201cTry and eliminate some of the vibrato,\u201d said Clem Ishmael, the show\u2019s global music supervisor.\u201cIt\u2019s very classical sounding,\u201d Ms. Taymor added. She did not mean that as a compliment.But they asked her to read a scene \u2014 the first time she had ever progressed that far \u2014 in which Rafiki tries, literally, to knock some sense into Simba.Again, Ms. Taymor heard something in Ms. Moeketsi\u2019s tone she didn\u2019t like. \u201cYou sound like the most luxurious sex doll,\u201d she cautioned. \u201cRafiki is an old baboon.\u201dThis was progress, and Ms. Moeketsi knew it. The team was now training her. \u201cFind the rhythm and percussion \u2014 play with the musicality, and enunciate on the consonants,\u201d Ms. Taymor said. \u201cYou understand what we\u2019re talking about.\u201dAnd then, as Fumane turned to leave, Ms. Taymor added one more word. \u201cBeautiful.\u201dTwo callbacks followed, and then the phone call Ms. Moeketsi had been craving for five years. Did she want to join the new international tour, in the ensemble and understudying Rafiki?\u201cMy mother was in tears when I told her,\u201d Ms. Moeketsi recalled. \u201cShe said, \u2018I know you\u2019re going to work hard to make sure everyone at home is taken care of.\u2019\u201dShe plans to return to her village one more time before departing, when she expects a sheep or a chicken to be slaughtered for a family feast, thanking the ancestors and asking for their help with a safe journey.And in Johannesburg, she is planning a party at which she will photograph advice her friends write on a whiteboard, \u201cso if I feel things are becoming tough, or I\u2019m struggling, I can read the messages to encourage myself, and remind myself where I come from.\u201dLater this month, she will fly to Manila for a costume fitting, and then in January, she will begin rehearsing there. She expects to be in the show through 2020. That\u2019s when the tour is due to reach South Africa.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s not about affordable coverage; it\u2019s about access: For too many rural areas, doctors and hospitals are scarce.If closings continue at this rate, 25 percent of America\u2019s rural hospitals will have disappeared in the decade after Obamacare\u2019s passage. This does not take into account facility deterioration, doctor departures or department closures.Medicaid expansion is a welcome source of new revenue to rural hospitals in Maine because more insured patients mean fewer uncompensated treatments. Still, it comes nowhere close to fixing the problem or, politically, putting any meaningful points on the Democratic scoreboard.It still doesn\u2019t solve the heart of the rural problem. Democrats can\u2019t just lower premiums and expand Medicaid. We must strengthen rural communities by making access to high-quality health care services a priority of any proposal. In any future legislation, we should demand grants for new hospitals, funds to modernize crumbling ones and financial incentives for top doctors to work in these areas.

But in the realm of public opinion, climate change isn\u2019t really a scientific issue. It\u2019s a political one.Even though better-educated Republicans may have more exposure to information about the science around climate change, they also have more exposure to partisan messages about it. And communications research says that matters more.On many other issues \u2013 social issues in particular, including abortion, gay marriage and divorce \u2013 more  education is associated with higher rates of acceptance, regardless of party. Gaps between Democrats and Republicans persisted, but the relationships moved more or less in tandem:On most other issues, education had little effect. Americans\u2019 views on terrorism, immigration, taxes on the wealthiest, and the state of health care in the United States did not change appreciably by education for Democrats and Republicans.Only a handful of issues had a shape like the one for climate change, in which higher education corresponded with higher agreement among Democrats and lower agreement among Republicans.So what distinguishes these issues, climate change in particular?It may be easier to think about in terms of simple partisanship. Most Americans know what party they belong to, but they can\u2019t be expected to know the details of every issue, so they tend to adopt the views of the leaders of the party they already identify with.Climate change is not a social issue like gay marriage, divorce, racism or abortion \u2013 issues where Democrats\u2019 and Republicans\u2019 views move in tandem with education. On those kinds of issues, college-educated Americans of both parties tend to be more progressive.But Americans do not treat climate change like a scientific issue either.

{"Headline": "A Middle-Class Tax Cut? It Depends Who and Where You Are", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisRepublicans promised a middle-class tax cut. So far, they have created mostly middle-class confusion.Both the evolving House bill and the emerging Senate plan would slash taxes for businesses and many wealthy individuals. What they would mean for the middle class, however, is less clear. The plans feature a spider web of intersecting and offsetting changes to the tax code that many taxpayers \u2014 and even many tax accountants \u2014 are struggling to untangle.This much is clear: Either version of the bill would be bad news for residents of high-tax, high-cost states, most of which tend to elect Democrats. Both bills would eliminate the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes \u2014 not a big deal in low-tax states such as Florida and Texas, but a potentially huge difference for many taxpayers in high-tax California and New York.The Senate bill would go further by also eliminating the deduction for state and local property taxes. That would be especially hard on states such as New Jersey that have high housing costs and that rely heavily on property taxes to fund their governments. (States won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 accounted for two-thirds of state and local tax deductions in 2015. They accounted for half of total income.)Michael Gottlieb, a 32-year-old health care lawyer who lives with his wife and two children in Fair Lawn, N.J., said he believed that his family would pay more in taxes based on the proposals being floated.\u201cYou add all of this up and I am taking a hit,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is a drastic hit, but I am coming out behind, not ahead.\u201dHis property tax and mortgage interest combined total $24,000 a year, while he estimates his state income tax would total another $10,000, for a total of $34,000 in itemized deductions. But under the new tax system, he would probably take only the standard deduction, which is $24,000 for a married couple filing jointly.That conclusion posed a political problem for Republicans, who have repeatedly promised a middle-class tax cut. Some Republicans, including Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, criticized the House bill for doing too little to benefit families. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, promised over the weekend that \u201cnobody in the middle class is going to pay more\u201d under the Senate plan.The Senate bill \u2014 the full text of which was released Thursday \u2014 probably falls short of that promise. But some economists said the bill would most likely be better for the middle class on average than the House bill.The Senate version keeps most of the provisions of the House bill that would have helped middle-class families, such as the doubling of the standard deduction, and would make others, such as the child tax credit, more generous. It would also preserve some tax breaks that the House bill initially would have eliminated, including a deduction for medical expenses and a tax credit for families who adopt children. Some of those provisions, including the adoption credit, had been restored by the House Ways and Means Committee, which approved a revised version of the bill on Thursday.Still, the tax cuts in the Senate bill would probably be modest for most middle-class families, especially compared with the far larger tax breaks for businesses and some high-income individuals.\u201cThe tax cut will still be a large windfall for very high-income people and a very small tax cut for low- and middle-income families,\u201d said Elaine Maag, who studies tax and spending policy for the Urban Institute.Tax preparers across the country said they were fielding nervous calls from clients wondering how the changes would affect them. Caitlin Campbell, president of Tower Financial Partners in Colorado Springs, said many of her clients had been excited about the prospect of tax cuts \u2014 until they began to hear details. The House bill would increase the tax credits given to families with children, but also eliminate the personal exemption given to every taxpayer. Those offsetting provisions would leave some larger families worse off.\u201cThey are surprised,\u201d Ms. Campbell said. \u201cThey thought it was going to be a good deal. They thought it was going to reduce their taxes, and they are surprised that they might not do as well.\u201dThat kind of uncertainty could pose political challenges for Republicans as they try to round up the 50 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate. Vanessa Williamson, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution who has studied public opinion on taxation, said the recent Republican approach to tax overhaul differed sharply from the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. The Bush tax cuts were simple to explain, easy to quantify and lowered taxes for just about everybody, she noted. This time, the Republican approach is much less simple.\u201cPeople are relatively risk-averse,\u201d Ms. Williamson said. \u201cSo if there\u2019s uncertainty about the benefits that you would receive, that\u2019s problematic.\u201dDeana L. Parsick, who runs a tax preparation company in Springfield, Mo., said clients had been calling her, too, but less out of anxiety than anticipation. Most of her clients have incomes of $25,000 to $35,000 a year, she said. They would benefit from the higher standard deduction and increased child tax credits.\u201cSo for my clientele, I haven\u2019t seen anything that would affect them negatively,\u201d Ms. Parsick said. \u201cThey\u2019re excited about the possibility, very excited.\u201dFor many, the offsetting provisions in the bill are difficult to figure out. Amy and Ben Powell, who live in Louisville, Ky., with their toddler son, collectively earn roughly $80,000. Mr. Powell is a choir teacher at a local middle school, while Ms. Powell works part time at a local coffee shop. They both work on the weekend, in their church, for extra cash: He is the music director and she leads the choir\u2019s altos to make sure they are on key.The couple generally prepare their tax return together through TurboTax, which she said makes it pretty clear which tax breaks help them the most: the child tax credit, their mortgage deduction, student loan interest, the credit for teachers who buy supplies for their classroom, and charitable giving.\u201cLast year was our first year of claiming a dependent, which gave us a nice chunk back on our return,\u201d Ms. Powell said.Most of those deductions would stay in place or grow under the Republican plan. But the Powells would lose the personal exemption \u2014 more than $12,000 this year \u2014 and they would no longer be able to deduct their student loan interest or Mr. Powell\u2019s classroom expenses. That made them nervous, they said.Ms. Powell said friends also had concerns about prospective changes, including the dependent care tax credit, which was eliminated in the first iteration of the House tax proposal. \u201cWe are both fortunate that we don\u2019t pay for child care,\u201d said Ms. Powell, who said her parents help watch their son. \u201cBut I have heard from friends who are worried that what you pay into child care is being tampered with in some way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "James Madison\u2019s Zigzag Path", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In April 1789, James Madison, a member of the House of Representatives and a trusted friend of George Washington, ghostwrote the new president\u2019s opening message to Congress. Then he drafted the House\u2019s official response to the president. As if that wasn\u2019t head-spinning enough, Washington then asked him to compose his response to the response. Madison was truly \u201cin dialogue with himself,\u201d as the editors of the Madison Papers put it.But the congressman was also in conflict with himself. Engaging in that dialogue violated his own carefully crafted blueprint for the separation of powers.As the Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman demonstrates in his illuminating and absorbing political biography, \u201cThe Three Lives of James Madison,\u201d Madison would remain in ongoing dialogue and conflict with himself for the rest of his life. Feldman explores Madison\u2019s reactive and improvisational thinking as it played out in the three uniquely consequential roles, or \u201clives,\u201d he had \u2014 as constitutional architect and co-author with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay of the \u201cFederalist Papers,\u201d political partisan and wartime president. The new nation, an idea still in progress, would inevitably call for reassessment, flexibility and innovation, and Feldman skillfully navigates the zigzag path of Madison\u2019s recalibrations. Except for his position on the issue of slavery, which Madison\u2019s allegiance to his planter class would cause him to consistently blur in a fog of words, he adjusted his theoretical ideas and practice of politics to the continuous flux of events.Madison\u2019s first life was as a proponent of an enduring constitution for a consolidated, centralized republic to replace the loose and dysfunctional alliance of states created under the Articles of Confederation. The Virginia Plan he brought to Philadelphia in 1787 became the basis for the convention\u2019s agenda. The delegates, however, would not always go as far as he wanted, especially when it came to his wish to clearly establish the sovereignty of the national government over the states. His proposal for a congressional veto over state laws in order to control, as he argued, \u201cthe centrifugal tendency of the states\u201d was overwhelmingly rejected, leaving him fearful that the Constitution might codify a constant tension and conflict between the national government and the states.Madison\u2019s adaptive genius was on full display with the Bill of Rights. Much of the opposition to the Constitution turned on its lack of a guarantee of individual rights. Thomas Jefferson also lamented this absence, but Madison initially failed to see the need for such assurances, which he described as mere \u201cparchment barriers,\u201d easy for \u201coverbearing majorities\u201d to override.But less than a year later, Madison, now a representative fulfilling a campaign promise to his constituents, introduced a series of such amendments in the House. \u201cWithout Madison, the bill of rights would not have been enacted,\u201d Feldman writes. \u201cThe entire episode showcased Madison\u2019s unique combination of theoretical brilliance and practical political flexibility. Although theory had told him a bill of rights was not necessary, political controversy and the need to get elected had shown that it was.\u201dThe sharp differences between Madison\u2019s vision of the new republic and Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton\u2019s triggered Madison\u2019s second life as a partisan politician. He was taken aback by Hamilton\u2019s Federalist blueprint for transforming the new United States into an economic powerhouse. The first phase was to be financial centralization through the national government\u2019s assumption of state debts. At a dinner in June 1790, Madison and Jefferson negotiated a compromise with Hamilton, and the mostly satisfied Virginians came away with their own concession, an agreement to locate the new national capital along the Potomac. But a few months later Hamilton raised the stakes once more with a proposal to create a national bank.Once the full scope of Hamilton\u2019s ambitions was revealed, Madison accused him, as he wrote in a newspaper article in 1792, of trying \u201cto pervert the limited government of the Union, into a government of unlimited discretion.\u201d In a move to halt the Federalists and their Hamiltonian agenda, Madison and Jefferson organized the nation\u2019s first political party, the Republicans \u2014 even though the notion of party politics ran against Madison\u2019s constitutional design to dampen the effect of factions.His shift away from total national sovereignty over states\u2019 rights became complete in 1798 after Congress passed and President John Adams signed the Sedition Act, targeting Republicans and their newspapers by restricting First Amendment rights. In reaction, an incensed Jefferson wrote his Kentucky Resolutions, arguing fatefully that the states had the power to nullify federal laws and even threatening \u201crevolution and blood.\u201dTroubled by Jefferson\u2019s intemperate radicalism, Madison offered a moderate alternative in his Virginia Resolutions, contending that the states had the right \u201cto interpose\u201d against federal legislation they viewed as unconstitutional. Although the man who had once championed a national veto over state laws now seemed to assert the right of states to reject acts of Congress, Madison insisted that interposition meant only an appeal to public opinion. How exactly that was to happen remained conveniently obscure.In Madison\u2019s third life as secretary of state under President Jefferson and then as president himself, he was forced to reassess repeatedly his own foreign policy positions. As secretary of state, he had preferred to maintain neutrality with regard to the burgeoning conflict between Britain and France. Britain, however, was determined to bring its former colonies to heel by harassing American commercial shipping and impressing American seamen. Madison turned to the tactic of economic coercion with a ban on trade with Britain. \u201cThe efficacy of an embargo,\u201d he confidently remarked to President Jefferson in 1805, \u201ccannot be doubted.\u201d But while it crippled the American economy, the embargo did virtually nothing to curb the British, and in June 1812, President Madison backed into war. The nation, he declared, could not remain \u201cpassive under these progressive usurpations, and these accumulating wrongs.\u201dAfter two years of fruitless conflict, both parties were ready for compromise. The signing of the Treaty of Ghent at the end of 1814 re-established the prewar status quo. By claiming that the American effort \u201ccannot fail to command the respect\u201d of all other nations, Madison \u201cset an influential precedent,\u201d Feldman astutely comments, \u201cfor subsequent American unwillingness to shine harsh light on wars that produced mixed results,\u201d a precedent that resonates today in Iraq and Afghanistan.Feldman does not discuss the elder statesman\u2019s role in the fraught nullification crisis of the late 1820s and early 1830s, but it\u2019s only a further example of Madison\u2019s political flexibility. South Carolina, furious about federal tariffs, cited Madison\u2019s Virginia Resolutions to argue that every state had the constitutional right to nullify federal laws and even withdraw from the union. For the rest of his life Madison rejected such an extreme interpretation of his Resolutions. The last of the founding fathers beseeched Americans to cherish and perpetuate their union, but the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions along with Madison\u2019s unwillingness to call for the abolition of slavery would continue to imperil the republic he so treasured.By the time of his death in 1836, the political order that Madison the dazzling political theorist had helped to design had been transformed by the partisan co-founder of the Republican Party, and had then barely survived a war under the executive leadership of the same man. Feldman\u2019s deeply thoughtful study shows that the three identities of James Madison constituted one exceptional life, which effectively mirrored the evolving identity of the American republic in its most formative phase. In Feldman\u2019s capable hands, Madison becomes the original embodiment of our \u201cliving Constitution.\u201dSusan Dunn is the Massachusetts professor of humanities at Williams College and the author of \u201cDominion of Memories: Jefferson, Madison and the Decline of Virginia.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Stocks were soaring and they swapped market tips and touted apps that allowed them to buy Bitcoin on the golf course.But the full stomachs and fat portfolios couldn\u2019t mask a sense of unease that pervaded the gathering: that the good times could suddenly end, derailed by nuclear war, political upheaval, a sudden rise in inflation or simply from stratospheric stocks crashing down to earth.\u201cInvestors have never felt less secure, even though we are eight years into a bull market,\u201d Mark H.

This year, not only is the index up 15 percent, but it also seems to have stopped going down at all: October was the 12th straight month that the S.&P. has logged a positive return, the first time that has happened since 1935.Yet in most conversations about the ever-rising stock market, brokers and investment advisers say, are dominated by the question of when it will all come to an end.With the exception of President Trump, of course. On Saturday, in an interview on Air Force One, he once again took credit for the market\u2019s most recent record close on Friday.Generally, this far into a bull market, euphoria kicks in. In 1929, shoeshine boys were doling out stock tips. In 1999, people were quitting their jobs to trade technology stocks from their living rooms.\u201cThe VIX is too low, valuations are too high, the recovery is too old and the Fed is tightening,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, a veteran market strategist for the Leuthold Group in Minnesota. \u201cFor an old market dude like me, that is a scary list.\u201dFor several years now, Mr. Paulsen has been pleading with his clients to embrace the bull market. He has touted the breadth of the surge, in which no single sector has dramatically outrun another on the way up. And he has argued that worldwide growth with little inflation represents an unusual buying opportunity.When he meets with clients or presents his views at conferences, though, the vast majority of the questions he receives are about what will ultimately bring the market crashing down.\u201cNo one ever asks me when the S.&P. is going to blow past 3,000,\u201d he said of the benchmark stock index which ended trading on Friday at 2,587.84.In fact, many analysts say that this so-called wall of worry is a positive sign. Investors may be piling into stocks and bonds, the thinking goes, but they are doing it with a measure of hesitation, which prevents some of the excesses that preceded previous market corrections.That is not to say the market is without froth.Since early 2009, the market capitalizations of Amazon and Apple, have soared from $26 billion and $74 billion to $532 billion and $872 billion.The surge in the price of Bitcoin strikes many observers, including the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, as a classic portent of a bubble ready to pop.These are not exactly the hallmarks of a restrained market.To a large extent, the main drivers of the bull market have been sophisticated investors. Cash holdings by institutions and high-net-worth investors are at record low levels, which means they have been plowing money into the markets, according to numerous surveys.Many retail investors, though, have remained on the sidelines \u2014 a sharp contrast to the activity that preceded the bursting of previous bubbles.According to Charles Schwab, which oversees $3.1 trillion in retail investments, the cash portion of client accounts was 11.1 percent as of September. That is down from 13 percent at the end of last year, but it is still a sizable ratio, which suggests that investors are not dumping their entire savings into the stock market, at least for now.Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist for Schwab, said that until just recently, investors have been highly skeptical that the market\u2019s bull run was justified. However, in the last month or so, she has noticed a change in sentiment at client meetings and investor events.\u201cSome investors are conceding it\u2019s a bull market,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are looking for approval to jump on the bandwagon.\u201dStill, she points out, retail investors have nowhere near the commitment to stocks that characterized past stock market booms.Richard Bernstein, a former equity strategist at Merrill Lynch who now runs his own investment firm, has been bullish on stocks since 2009. He said that by this point of a strong equity run, buying stocks traditionally becomes widely accepted by all investor classes \u2014 the consequence of one outstanding stock market year following another. Nobody wants to hear their neighbors boasting about their sizzling portfolios without having their own good news to share.That is not the case this time. According to Mr. Bernstein, Wall Street experts on average advise investors to put 55 percent of their portfolios into stocks, as opposed to other assets such as bonds. That is considerably more conservative than the traditional recommendation that investors have up to 65 percent in stocks.And many pension funds, instead of investing in the stock market, are putting money into private-equity investments, even though they incur hefty fees and their money generally gets locked up for 10 years.\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cSo when people say there is euphoria in the market and people are getting carried away, I say, \u2018who are we talking about?\u2019\u201dLate last month, at an investor panel sponsored by the fund company Eaton Vance, Mr. Bernstein cited the rising South Korean stock market in arguing that fears of nuclear war were overblown and should not be used as an excuse for investors to avoid putting their money into stocks.As usual, the pushback was quick in coming.What happens if war breaks out in the Korean Peninsula, a member of the audience asked him. Wasn\u2019t he ignoring that possibility?Mr. Bernstein argued that investors should care the economic and corporate fundamentals \u2014 not the remote chance that a calamity will strike.\u201cYou cannot invest successfully,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you are crouched under your desk in a fetal position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where the STEM Jobs Are (and Where They Aren\u2019t)", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe national priority in education can be summed up in a four-letter acronym: STEM. And that\u2019s understandable. A country\u2019s proficiency in science, technology, engineering and mathematics is vital in generating economic growth, advancing scientific innovation and creating good jobs.The STEM campaign has been underway for years, championed by policymakers across the ideological spectrum, embraced in schools everywhere and by organizations ranging from the YWCA to the Boy Scouts. By now, the term \u2014 first popularized and promoted by the National Science Foundation \u2014 is used as a descriptive identifier. \u201cShe\u2019s a STEM,\u201d usually meant as a compliment, suggests someone who has a leg up in the college admissions sweepstakes.Much of the public enthusiasm for STEM education rests on the assumption that these fields are rich in job opportunity. Some are, some aren\u2019t. STEM is an expansive category, spanning many disciplines and occupations, from software engineers and data scientists to geologists, astronomers and physicists.What recent studies have made increasingly apparent is that the greatest number of high-paying STEM jobs are in the \u201cT\u201d (specifically, computing).\u201cThere is a huge divide between the computing technology roles and the traditional sciences,\u201d said Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor\u2019s chief economist.In a recent analysis, Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, focused on the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment forecasts in STEM categories. In the decade ending in 2024, 73 percent of STEM job growth will be in computer occupations, but only 3 percent will be in the physical sciences and 3 percent in the life sciences.A working grasp of the principles of science and math should be essential knowledge for all Americans, said Michael S. Teitelbaum, an expert on science education and policy. But he believes that STEM advocates, often executives and lobbyists for technology companies, do a disservice when they raise the alarm that America is facing a worrying shortfall of STEM workers, based on shortages in a relative handful of fast-growing fields like data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and computer security.\u201cWhen it gets generalized to all of STEM, it\u2019s misleading,\u201d said Mr. Teitelbaum, a senior research associate in the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School. \u201cWe\u2019re misleading a lot of young people.\u201dIf physicists and biologists want to enjoy the boom times in the digital economy, a few specialist start-ups will train them and find them jobs as data scientists and artificial intelligence programmers.Carlos Faham made that passage. He had an impressive academic career, with a string of grant awards and fellowships. His Ph.D. from Brown University was in dark-matter physics. After Brown, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.Dr. Faham loved the research, but after nearly two years he was feeling the strain of that life. By then, he had spent 12 years in college, graduate school and postgraduate research. His next step would be to compete for a handful of tenure-track teaching openings across the country. For the pricey Bay Area, he wasn\u2019t making enough. A postdoc researcher typically makes $40,000 to $60,000 a year.Dr. Faham had done serious programming for his physics research. He applied to tech companies, figuring they would be eager to hire someone with his intellectual firepower. He couldn\u2019t get an in-person interview. He was told his background was too academic. He fumbled a couple of phone screening interviews because the statistical and machine-learning problems were unfamiliar to him.\u201cIt was like hitting a wall running at full speed, really humbling,\u201d he recalled.Dr. Faham joined the seven-week Insight Data Science Fellows program in 2015. There was no formal course work. Other than a few tutorials by industry people, the time was spent creating a product \u2014 his was software for recognizing and tracking faces in video \u2014 and training for interviews. That involved solving a programming problem on a white board and explaining his thinking. \u201cInterviewing is a muscle and you have to exercise it again and again,\u201d he said. After the program, he received six job offers. He accepted the offer from LinkedIn. (Insight is free for participants; hiring companies pay an undisclosed fee.)Today, Dr. Faham, 33, is a senior data scientist, working on a team that uses machine learning and statistical models to detect illicit activity on the social network, including fake job listings, ad fraud, spam and bot attacks.The range of data-intensive detective work, he said, is \u201cextremely rich\u201d and \u201cit moves so much faster than my previous world.\u201d He makes a \u201cpretty good six-figure salary,\u201d about five times what he did as a postdoctoral researcher.About 90 percent of those who enter the Insight program have landed jobs as data analysts, the company says, with a dropout rate of about 3 percent.Anasuya Das made a similar career move, but not one as far from her academic training. After the program, Dr. Das, whose Ph.D. is in neuroscience, joined the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she is now a senior data scientist. She works on a team that creates software tools for the center\u2019s doctors, nurses and researchers. One current project is a program to recommend the most promising clinical trials for individual cancer patients, based on their medical histories, age, gender and genetics.Data science is distinctly different from neuroscience, Dr. Das said, but some of the tools she employs, like a machine-learning technique called artificial neural networks, do take their inspiration from the brain. Her experience points to the larger trend that digital technologies like data science and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in nearly every discipline. So technology and the other STEM fields merge.That is the thinking behind a new division of data sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, that started in July. The division is a response to student demand and advancing technology. Berkeley\u2019s \u201cFoundations of Data Science\u201d course attracted 1,200 students from more than 50 majors in the last academic year.The choice of the term \u201cdivision\u201d rather than \u201cinstitute,\u201d explained David Culler, the interim dean for data sciences, underlines its approach. \u201cWe want this to be something foundational across the university, innovating with other disciplines, not differentiating from them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the academic world mirroring what is happening in the larger economy.\u201dSteve Lohr is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ivanka Trump, a Media Darling in Japan, Draws Light Turnout in Tokyo", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 As the president might say, the room was half full.Josh Raffel, a White House spokesman, said Ms. Trump\u2019s speech \u201cwas the most registered event\u201d at the conference \u201cbut security delayed everyone from being able to get into the room on time.\u201dKyoko Hokugo, director of the gender mainstreaming division at Japan\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said that registration for the event was high, but \u201cit was unfortunate that there were several people who could not enter the room during the speeches of Prime Minister Abe and Ms. Ivanka Trump. We needed to shut the door during their speeches for our security reasons.\u201dCommentators in Japan have suggested Ms. Trump played an instrumental role in planting the seeds of that relationship, which has since blossomed with the leaders\u2019 shared love of golf, which they are scheduled to play during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit.\u201cMr. Trump didn\u2019t like Japan at first,\u201d Katsuya Konishi, a journalist, said on a morning news show on TV Asahi on Friday. \u201cBut he gradually changed his mind. I think it was the influence of Ivanka. She said Prime Minister Abe is smart and advised Mr. Trump to listen to him.\u201dMs. Trump\u2019s appearance at the World Assembly for Women added a touch of celebrity glamour to the event, and was consistent with Mr. Abe\u2019s approach to female empowerment, in which public gestures have outstripped genuine change.And while Mr. Abe said that 1.5 million more women have joined the work force since he became prime minister five years ago, making women about 45 percent of the total in Japan, more than half of them work in part-time jobs with lower benefits and fewer hopes of career advancement.\u201cWhat is Ivanka Trump going to be to Japan more than a celebrity figure?\u201d said Nancy Snow, a professor of diplomacy at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies who attended the speech. \u201cIs she really going to up the ante here or move the needle? It\u2019s sort of window dressing and making Japan maybe feel better about itself, despite these statistics.\u201dAmong Japanese, reaction to Ms. Trump\u2019s visit reflected some entrenched attitudes toward women. Several commentators on TV Asahi noted the salmon-colored, miniskirted suit that Ms. Trump wore to her speech, and one suggested that her skirt was \u201crather short\u201d for a presidential adviser.Several women who attended Ms. Trump\u2019s speech commented on her appearance in explaining why they admired her.\u201cShe is a beautiful female leader,\u201d Rena Hayakawa, 21, a political science major at Meiji University in Tokyo, said before the speech. \u201cHer fashion is great. She is a role model for women.\u201d Maina Tanaka, 33, a financial trade dealer, said that she appreciated Ms. Trump\u2019s \u201cfair views on politics and economy\u201d and that she respected how Ms. Trump \u201cstays positive and gorgeous.\u201dMieko Nakabayashi, a professor of politics at Waseda University, said Ms. Trump\u2019s glamour would draw attention to the cause of women.\u201cShe\u2019s not just an official, but also a princess of the president,\u201d said Ms. Nakabayashi, who spent a decade working as a budget staff member in the United States Senate. \u201cSo that kind of celebrity is really liked in Japan.\u201dMs. Nakabayashi added that many Japanese women were not yet conscious about the large pay gap between men and women. \u201cTherefore, for the Japanese government, getting attention is really an important step.\u201dIn her speech, Ms. Trump focused on initiatives in the United States, citing the president\u2019s budget plan for paid family leave and his administration\u2019s proposed tax changes, which she said would \u201cput more money back in the pockets of hard-working Americans.\u201dShe also called for countries like the United States and Japan to \u201cempower women who live in countries that prevent them from leading.\u201dHisako Ueno and Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Future of Flying? You Can See It Now", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the not-too-distant future, a traveler\u2019s face will replace a boarding pass, and recognition software will replace the gate agent scanning each traveler\u2019s ticket. Airline executives separated by distance will be able to use virtual reality eyewear to walk together through an airplane cabin and solve design problems.In this same future, autonomous vehicles could help passengers check in and airplanes push back.The future is now as the aviation industry embraces new technology as enthusiastically as it does jumbo jets packed with well-behaved, premium-fare paying passengers.\u201cThey\u2019ve got expectations from shopping on Amazon,\u201d said Jim Peters, chief technology officer for the airline-owned technology company SITA. \u201cThey get information when they want it. They collaborate with friends and they expect that will be a natural way for them to be interacting as they travel.\u201dOne of the newest developments in aviation evolved from consumer video games. As the visual product improved, virtual reality products using fine-tuned, realistic 3-D environments were incorporated for design, training and marketing in the air travel industry.It would take \u201ccrazy-man money\u201d to actually build a prototype and inspect it this way, said David Balfour, a visualization specialist with the company. Virtual reality allows airlines to \u201cput a virtual-reality headset on and stand up and view an entire cabin.\u201dIn the virtual-reality environment, to err is actually a good thing, said Glenn Johnson, director of the design studio at Rockwell Collins.Designs \u201cfail quicker and cheaper,\u201d he said, which means improvements can come faster.This ability to create large and complex environments also makes virtual reality promising for training airfield staff members who work in hazardous environments, servicing airliners in all kinds of weather and light conditions.\u201cYou are living the training because you are active in the training,\u201d Mr. Leger said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a game where you have a score at the end, so it goes to the emotional part of your brain.\u201dConsidering that airline pilots do recurrent training in a simulator on a regular basis, bringing a simulated setting to other areas of the industry is not a new concept. It is only recently, however, that the improved quality and lower cost of virtual reality have made its widespread use practical.With all the showy advantages of virtual reality, some airlines are trying to turn the \u201cwow\u201d into revenue. At a pop-up cafe in London earlier this month, Air Canada invited visitors to watch a Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight in virtual reality. The German airline Lufthansa prepared a 360 video of the interior of its long-haul aircraft, and its employees presented viewing goggles to ticketed passengers waiting at boarding gates in Newark and Frankfurt last year. After watching the show, Lufthansa, asked if they wanted to purchase an upgrade to a premium economy seat.\u201cHow can you communicate a travel product? This is the problem in the industry,\u201d said Torsten Wingenter, Lufthansa\u2019s senior director of digital innovations. Virtual reality gave the company the \u201cfirst chance to show the product in an emotional way.\u201dAfter the test, the emotion at the airline can be described as happy. A number of economy passengers paid $299 more to fly in premium economy after viewing the cabin in virtual reality. Mr. Wingenter would not say how many, but that it was \u201ca significant number.\u201dIn December, Lufthansa passengers flying out of Los Angeles will be able to use what JetBlue customers in Boston are already using \u2014 boarding gates that let passengers onto the airplane with no paper ticket or electronic boarding pass, just a face that matches their passport photo.On two JetBlue routes, from Boston to Aruba and the Dominican Republic, passengers stand in front of a camera that takes their picture and compares it to the traveler\u2019s image in the passport database of Customs and Border Protection.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing about three seconds for the photograph to be taken, transmitted and a positive response back,\u201d said Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue\u2019s executive vice president of customer experience.Facial recognition will be expanded. Ms. Geraghty said this was the beginning of a new era for travelers.\u201cYou can go into an airport and you won\u2019t need to show a boarding card, you won\u2019t need to pull out a passport,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be no bag tag, no lines, you almost walk right onto an aircraft. That\u2019s the world I look forward to.\u201dMs. Geraghty is like many aviation technology specialists who look at developments in other industries and think about how they could improve air travel.In a workshop in Geneva, SITA has several robots that travel to industry conferences around the world to start conversations about how autonomous vehicles might be used in aviation.Whether Kate or Leo end up at your local airport is not the point, said Mr. Peters, SITA\u2019s technology chief.\u201cThe robots are also demonstrators to get people talking about what is the future of autonomous vehicles in the airport,\u201d Mr. Peters said. But for all that technology has to offer, one of the most important tests is how well the next new gadget plays with people.\u201cSome things can be prototyped and some things can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cSome things you have to have a physical interaction with to figure out what works.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Coast Guard\u2019s \u2018Floating Guant\u00e1namos\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "FeatureIn an expansion of the war on drugs, the U.S. Coast Guard is targeting low-level smugglers in international waters \u2014 shackling them on ships for weeks or even months before arraignment in American courts.Supported byBy day Arcentales would stand against the wall and stare out at the water, his mind blank one moment, the next racing with thoughts of his wife and their newborn son. He had not spoken to his family, though he asked each day to call home. He increasingly felt panicked, fearing his wife would believe he was dead.Arcentales has wide muscular shoulders from his 25 years hauling fishing nets from the sea. But his meals now consisted of a handful of rice and beans, and he could feel his body shrinking from the undernourishment and immobility. \u201cThe moment we would stand up, we would get nauseated, our heads would spin,\u201d he recalled. The 20-some prisoners aboard the vessel \u2014 Ecuadorians, Guatemalans and Colombians \u2014 would often stand through the night, their backs aching, their bodies frigid from the wind and rain, waiting for the morning sun to rise and dry them.In the first weeks, Arcentales had turned to his friend Carlos Quijije, another fisherman from the small town of Jaramij\u00f3, to calm him. They were chained side by side, and the 26-year-old would offer some perspective. \u201cRelax brother, everything is going to work out,\u201d Arcentales remembered Quijije saying. \u201cThey\u2019ll take us to Ecuador, and we will see our families.\u201d But after two months of being shackled aboard the ship, Quijije seemed just as despondent. They often thought they would simply disappear.By this time it was November 2014, and in the brick box of a house where Arcentales lived in Ecuador, Lorena Mendoza, Arcentales\u2019s wife, and their children were praying together for his return. In Jaramij\u00f3, it is not unheard-of for fishermen to vanish, stranded by a broken motor, shot by a pirate or shipwrecked in a storm. \u201cI was always worried that we would never see him again,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut he always came home.\u201d This time Mendoza was certain she would receive a call to collect Arcentales\u2019s waterlogged body from the docks.Mendoza had no way of knowing that her husband was still alive. He had departed Jaramij\u00f3 because his family needed money so desperately that he had accepted a job smuggling cocaine off the coast of Ecuador. But deep in the Pacific, Arcentales and the other fishermen he traveled with were stopped not by pirates or vigilantes but by the United States Coast Guard, deployed more than 2,000 miles from U.S. shores to trawl for Andean cocaine. Over the past six years, more than 2,700 men like Arcentales have been taken from boats suspected of smuggling Colombian cocaine to Central America, to be carried around the ocean for weeks or months as the American ships continue their patrols. These fishermen-turned-smugglers are caught in international waters, or in foreign seas, and often have little or no understanding of where the drugs aboard their boats are ultimately bound. Yet nearly all of these boatmen are now carted from the Pacific and delivered to the United States to face criminal charges here, in what amounts to a vast extraterritorial exertion of American legal might.Congress responded by passing a set of laws, including the 1986 Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, that defined drug smuggling in international waters as a crime against the United States, even when there was no proof that the drugs, often carried on foreign boats, were bound for the United States. The Coast Guard was conscripted as the agency empowered to seek out suspected smugglers and bring them to American courts.In the 1990s and through the 2000s, maritime detentions averaged around 200 a year. Then in 2012, the Department of Defense\u2019s Southern Command, tasked with leading the war on drugs in the Americas, launched a multinational military campaign called Operation Martillo, or \u201chammer.\u201d The goal was to shut down smuggling routes in the waters between South and Central America, stopping large shipments of cocaine carried on speedboats thousands of miles from the United States, long before they could be broken down and carried over land into Mexico and then into the United States. In 2016, under the Southern Command\u2019s strategy, the Coast Guard, with intermittent help from the U.S. Navy and international partners, detained 585 suspected drug smugglers, mostly in international waters. That year, 80 percent of these men were taken to the United States to face criminal charges, up from a third of detainees in 2012. In the 12 months that ended in September 2017, the Coast Guard captured more than 700 suspects and chained them aboard American ships.Over the last year, I\u2019ve interviewed seven former Coast Guard detainees, some of whom are still in American federal prison, and received detailed letters, some with pencil renderings of the detention ships, from a dozen others. Most of these men remain confounded by their capture by the Americans, dubious that U.S. officials had the authority to arrest them and to lock them in prison. But it is the memory of their surreal imprisonment at sea that these men say most torments them. Together with thousands of pages of court records and interviews with current and former Coast Guard officers, these detainees paint a grim picture of the conditions of their extended capture on ships deployed in the extraterritorial war on drugs.Their protracted detention is justified by Coast Guard officials and federal prosecutors alike, who argue that suspects like Arcentales are not formally under arrest when the Coast Guard detains them. While on board, they\u2019re not read Miranda rights, not appointed lawyers, not allowed to contact their consulate or their families. They don\u2019t appear to benefit from federal rules of criminal procedure that require that criminal suspects arrested outside the United States be presented before a judge \u201cwithout unnecessary delay.\u201d It is as if their rights are in suspension during their capture at sea. \u201cIt\u2019s hard-wired into the Coast Guard\u2019s minds,\u201d says Eugene R. Fidell, a former Coast Guard lawyer who teaches at Yale Law School, \u201cthat usual law enforcement constraints don\u2019t apply.\u201dThe increased detentions and the domestic prosecutions of extraterritorial activity were ushered in largely under the watch of Gen. John Kelly, who from 2012 to 2016 served as the head of the Southern Command and is now the White House chief of staff. He has long championed the idea that drug smuggling and the drug-related violence in Central America poses what he has called an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to the United States and that to protect the homeland, American law enforcement must reach beyond U.S. borders. This April, during his brief tenure as Trump\u2019s secretary of Homeland Security, which now oversees the Coast Guard, Kelly gave a lecture at George Washington University. \u201cWe are a nation under attack\u201d from transnational criminal networks, he told the audience. \u201cThe more we push our borders out, the safer our homeland will be,\u201d he said. \u201cThat includes Coast Guard drug interdictions at sea.\u201d Asked about the detainments, a White House spokesperson said, \u201cUnder General Kelly\u2019s command, U.S. personnel treated detainees humanely and followed applicable laws.\u201d The spokesperson declined to comment further.Arcentales never had much money. The $6,000 he could hope to make a year, on the skiff and working on tuna ships for a month or two at a time, does not stretch far in Ecuador\u2019s economy. The house where he and Mendoza lived was just a single room for their family of nine: their teenage son, Enrique; Mendoza\u2019s two older daughters from a previous marriage, Nelly and Juliana, who have three children between them; and Nelly\u2019s husband, Wladimir Jaramillo. They all slept on fraying mattresses, sharing a single toilet. When it rained, the roof leaked and muddy water trickled through the door.The thrum of anxiety about money became an alarm in 2014 when Mendoza unexpectedly became pregnant at 43. A doctor prescribed bed rest. Too worried to be out at sea for long, Arcentales worked less. That July, Mendoza gave birth to a boy they named Ismael. The household had grown to 10. It would be more than two months before his next fishing trip, and Arcentales could not escape the nagging sense of failure. \u201cI would lie some nights in bed, asking myself, \u2018Am I going to live my entire life in a hut that is close to falling apart?\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201c\u2009\u2018What will I leave my children?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe next evening, he and Quijije met another man in San Lorenzo, near the Colombian border. The man led them to a skiff, gave Arcentales a GPS tracker and instructed the pair to meet another boat at a location 50 nautical miles away. There, he said, they would collect 100 kilos of cocaine, split in four packages, and the coordinates for another vessel less than a day\u2019s trip away where they would drop off the drugs and then be done. But when they arrived at the location to retrieve the drugs, they were instead given 440 kilos of cocaine and joined by a baby-faced Colombian in his early 20s named Jair Guevara Payan, paid to watch the drugs. Payan led Arcentales and Quijije on a five-day voyage, 1,100 miles to the north, farther than either man had ever ventured. Arcentales considered refusing to go, but he knew there was no real choice now that they were at sea. \u201cWe had been screwed,\u201d he told me.When Arcentales, Quijije and Payan finally arrived at their final coordinates, 145 miles off the coast of Guatemala, a small white speedboat motored toward them, then another, each manned by two Guatemalan men. Together, the men offloaded the drugs onto one of the boats, and Payan motored away on it with a pair of Guatemalan brothers. Arcentales and Quijije were told to step into the second boat, a skiff called the Yeny Arg, manned by the two other Guatemalans, Giezi Zamora, a mechanic, and Hector Castillo, a fisherman. The four of them headed for shore, and Arcentales let his senses dull for the first time since he had set out. \u201cWe are free,\u201d he thought to himself, and nearly fell asleep.But a U.S. Navy patrol airplane had been tracking the Guatemalan boats since the morning. The plane\u2019s crew had watched the men step into the arriving boats and the Southern Command had contacted the Coast Guard. Soon, Arcentales spotted a white military ship, then a speedboat with five officers aboard racing toward them. The officers ordered Arcentales and the others not to move, and the men raised their hands in the air.When boats are not registered to a country or flying a country\u2019s flag, they are considered stateless, and maritime laws allow U.S. officials to board. Hundreds of these unmarked boats depart from Ecuador and Colombia each year. But the Yeny Arg was registered in Guatemala, so federal officials contacted their Guatemalan counterparts to gain permission, under a bilateral agreement, to board and conduct a search. U.S. authorities have some 40 agreements with countries around the world to gain access to foreign vessels. For some countries, U.S. prosecution removes a burden from their own legal systems; with other countries, the U.S. has exerted pressure on governments to forge such agreements. Countries in the Americas and the Caribbean have generally allowed U.S. officials to board and search ships that bear their flags.For several hours, the Coast Guard officers searched the Yeny Arg. By midafternoon, Arcentales, Quijije and the two Guatamalans were moved to the Coast Guard speedboat, and were delivered to the Coast Guard ship. On board, they had mug shots taken. Less than 12 hours later, the men were moved to a Coast Guard ship called the Boutwell, a 378-foot, 46-year-old cutter with a crew of 160. Payan and the Guatemalan brothers were already onboard.The men were not told where they would be taken nor allowed to call their families. Officials told them to strip down and change into papery white Tyvek jump suits, and then guards led them up a flight of stairs above the deck and into a hangar. Arcentales felt a cuff close around his ankle. He and Quijije looked at each other, and then at their ankles, which, he said, were now attached to the floor by short chains. Thin rubber mats would serve as their beds. \u201cA deep sadness came over me,\u201d Arcentales said. \u201cRight there my life changed.\u201dBut as they approached land, a guard showed up with a plastic bucket to use as a toilet. An officer closed the doors of the hangar where they were held. Through small holes in the wall, they could see people walking on the docks. The Guatemalans recognized a port called Acajutla. An hour passed, then four, then eight. When the narrow beams of light that had shone through the holes in the hangar wall faded, they felt the Boutwell move. The boat\u2019s engines roared, and a guard threw open the doors: The sun was setting, and the men were back at sea. For 30 minutes, an hour maybe, they sat in silence, watching the water and the sky become dark, their minds turning to their families. That night, Arcentales and Castillo, the Guatemalan fisherman, both cried, their chests heaving as the other men looked out at the sea.Coast Guard and Southern Command officials, including John Kelly, have argued that if the agency had more ships to deploy, it could interdict four times as much cocaine. \u201cBecause of asset shortfalls, we\u2019re unable to get after 74 percent of suspected maritime drug smuggling,\u201d Kelly said at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in 2014. \u201cI simply sit and watch it go by.\u201d Colombian cocaine production is again on the rise, and while the Coast Guard says it has seized nearly half a million pounds of cocaine over the past year, agency officials have warned as recently as this September that they need more resources to stop the flow.Government officials say intelligence gained from small-time boatmen is key to investigating and dismantling larger transnational criminal networks. The Coast Guard has claimed that between 2002 and 2011, cases against these maritime smugglers helped the government secure three-quarters of its extraditions of Colombian drug kingpins. Affidavits filed more recently in criminal cases against three Mexican and Central American drug leaders, including the notorious cartel leader El Chapo, have noted boat interdictions as small points in larger constellations of evidence. By linking kingpins to boats, prosecutors can add maritime smuggling to the list of charges against them. But the fishermen caught aboard these small smuggling boats, many detained on their first or second run, often have access to mere fragments of information about the people they\u2019re working for. For the most part, men like Arcentales barely know the identity of their recruiter, sometimes just a first name or moniker, and nothing more. \u201cThey are not key widgets in this process,\u201d said Bruce Bagley, a leading scholar on drug smuggling and a professor of political science at the University of Miami. By prosecuting them, he added, \u201cyou don\u2019t slow down the broader operations.\u201dThe cocaine made land long before the detainees. For 44 more days, Arcentales, Quijije, Payan and the Guatemalans were transferred from one ship to the next, passing a week or 10 days on one, a few days on another, always chained to the decks. \u201cI remember one time I asked the nurse officer if he could do me a favor,\u201d Payan wrote later in a letter, \u201cjust shoot me and kill me, I would appreciate, because I cannot take this anymore.\u201d As day after mind-numbing day dragged on, hunger began to rival their families as their central preoccupation. Food logs from Coast Guard ships and testimony from Coast Guard officers show that on some ships, detainees\u2019 meals consisted of only small portions of black beans and rice, on occasion with a bit of spinach or chicken. Arcentales says that he learned to eat slowly, to fool his mind into thinking the plate contained more than it did. The men watched the guards discard their unfinished meals into trash bags hanging nearby and devised a plan. \u201cSomeone would ask to be taken to the restroom so that we could try to reach the trash and take the food,\u201d Quijije said in testimony. They would pass a piece of leftover chicken down the line, each detainee taking a bite and handing it to the next, until the bone was picked clean. After more than two months of detention, Arcentales says, he had lost 20 pounds; Payan says he lost 50. Time began to warp for them. \u201cWe could no longer endure living in such conditions for that prolonged period of time,\u201d Arcentales wrote later in a letter. \u201cIt did not matter to us where they would leave us; we were desperate to communicate with our family.\u201d The Coast Guard and the Department of Justice maintain that all detainees are treated humanely and with accordance to the law. The Coast Guard adds that it shackles detainees and conceals them while in port for their own safety and the safety of the crew.The Coast Guard does not have discretion over where and when to transfer drug-interdiction detainees. Those decisions are made by the Department of Justice, the D.E.A. and federal prosecutors with information from the Coast Guard. Coast Guard officers I spoke to, one of whom was disturbed enough to call the vessels \u201cboat prisons,\u201d say they want detainees removed far more rapidly from their ships, which they acknowledge were never designed to serve as detention centers. Drug Enforcement Administration agents say in court filings that rapid transfers to U.S. soil are logistically impossible, with few countries allowing airport transfers and a shortage of available D.E.A. flights. The Coast Guard says the agency patrols six million square miles, which creates \u201clogistical and transportation challenges.\u201dBut there\u2019s evidence in those court filings that budgetary considerations may also add to the delays. In 2015, a Southern Command official suggested in an email to a D.E.A. agent who was handling a Coast Guard detainee transfer that the agency \u201cmay save costs to the taxpayers\u201d when weighing the benefits of one route back versus another. In an April 2017 brief in a separate case, the government argued that pulling a cutter from normal drug-smuggling patrol to hasten a detainee transfer would be a \u201cconsiderable waste of government resources and time.\u201dCoast Guard ships and frigates on loan from the Navy instead slowly fill up their hangars or decks, waiting to unload detainees when port calls can be arranged with foreign officials and flights arranged with the D.E.A. Other detainees are simply kept aboard cutters as they make trips back to San Diego or through the Panama Canal on the way to East Coast ports. No matter the route, federal judges have repeatedly waived normal protections against extended prearraignment detention, accepting the government\u2019s claims that transferring detainees from the Pacific is too logistically complex to allow for a speedy appearance before a judge. And so over the years federal judges have allowed for progressively longer periods of detainment: five days in the Caribbean in 1985; then 11 in 2006; in 2012, 19 days in the Pacific. Average detention time is now 18 days. An official told me that men have been held up to 90 days.Maritime- and human-rights-law scholars caution that the delayed periods of detention employed by the United States in its antidrug campaign run counter to international human rights norms. \u201cIn a European context, what the U.S. does would not meet the standard,\u201d says Efthymios Papastavridis, a maritime-law scholar at Oxford University. \u201cIt would have to be measured against human rights and due-process law and this would be unlikely to pass the test.\u201dBut Melanie Reid, a former federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice\u2019s Dangerous Narcotics division, said the department\u2019s position was that \u201cthe clock does not start ticking, in the procedural sense, until these people get to the United States and are arrested.\u201d A senior Coast Guard lawyer wrote in a 2016 paper on maritime enforcement and human rights that \u201cno remedy for these delays is generally available to defendants.\u201dWhen she returned home, Mendoza saw that she had missed a series of phone calls from the United States. At 11 the next morning the phone rang again. \u201cI am here,\u201d Arcentales said. \u201cI am alive.\u201d Mendoza cried, overcome by a great swell of relief. \u201cThank God I can hear my family again, thank God you are all O.K.,\u201d Arcentales said.Several days before, the American ship had taken yet another trip to port, this time on the coast of Panama. This time the detainees were told to stand up. Guards unlocked their ankle cuffs and led them off the ship. He would see his family soon, Arcentales thought. Then he heard a guard announce: \u201cGentlemen, D.E.A. agents are waiting for you outside. You are going to the United States.\u201dUnlike domestic arrests, which stipulate that defendants be charged in the jurisdiction of their crime, maritime smugglers can be prosecuted anywhere, as long as it\u2019s the first place they land or in the District of Columbia. American law-enforcement officials have developed a clear preference for prosecuting maritime smuggling cases in Florida, where federal agencies have set up interagency drug-task forces and prosecutors have expertise on maritime drug cases. Trying these cases in Florida may have made practical sense in the 1980s and even the 1990s, when the bulk of maritime interdictions took place in the Caribbean. But now that sea smuggling has shifted significantly to the Pacific, the desire to prosecute defendants in Florida\u2019s federal courts has arguably played a role in the increasingly prolonged maritime detentions.One reason few trials have moved to the West Coast may be that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California, has placed a significant limit on the reach of the U.S. Coast Guard. Unlike courts on the East Coast, the Ninth Circuit requires federal prosecutors to prove that drugs discovered on foreign-registered boats were actually bound for the United States. That decision, in 1994, returned the legal framework in California to something more like the one that existed nationally in the 1980s. Prosecuting smugglers found aboard a foreign-flagged ship without proving their cargo was intended for U.S. markets, the court found, violates Fifth Amendment due-process protections. \u201cWe try not to bring these cases to the Ninth Circuit,\u201d said Aaron Casavant, a Coast Guard lawyer who until 2014 provided legal guidance to the service\u2019s law-enforcement operations and recently wrote a law-review article defending the legal basis of extraterritorial drug enforcement. Casavant points to the fact that there are more lawyers and judges with maritime experience in Florida. But the Justice Department would likely lose a case like Arcentales\u2019s in the Ninth Circuit, where there is a burden of proof. The majority of these cases are tried in the 11th Circuit in Florida, where no such burden exists.Orlando do Campo, a private defense lawyer in Miami, has been assigned by the courts to handle 23 cases of maritime smuggling. \u201cIt\u2019s like a nature documentary where you see the hawk grab the fish out of water, and the fish is there saying, \u2018What the hell am I doing in the air?\u2019\u2009\u201d do Campo said. \u201cFor them that\u2019s Florida. \u2018A few weeks ago, I was in Ecuador, then I went into the middle of the Pacific and now I\u2019m here?\u2019 It\u2019s entirely surreal.\u201dSuch motions, in the rare instances when defense lawyers file them, have little effect. Lawyers for three men whose detention overlapped on a cutter with Arcentales petitioned a federal court to throw out their indictments for \u201coutrageous government conduct.\u201d The judge said he was troubled by detainees\u2019 accounts of \u201cinadequate nutrition, weight loss, lack of privacy for toilet use and lack of sufficient protection from the elements.\u201d Even so, he said, the \u201cinhumane treatment\u201d had not been used \u201cin an effort to secure an indictment,\u201d so he could not dismiss this indictment. \u201cThis is not to say that such treatment of detainees is condoned by this court,\u201d he added. \u201cFar from it.\u201dOn July 2, 2015, Arcentales and Castillo were taken to court for a sentencing hearing. In testimony before Congress this year, John Kelly attested that \u201csuspects from these cases divulge information during prosecution and sentencing that is critical to indicting, extraditing and convicting drug-cartel leadership and dismantling their sophisticated networks.\u201d But the judge presiding in the Arcentales case, Virginia Hernandez Covington, made it clear that the two men were of little use. \u201cThey are just trying to do it to make some money for their family,\u201d Covington said in court. \u201cThe higher up you are, the more information you have. You\u2019re more culpable. But you have more information.\u201d She continued, \u201cThe lower level folks have less information to bargain with.\u201d But defendants charged under the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, even mules like Arcentales, are rarely provided reduced sentences on mandatory minimums, as a suspect caught on U.S. shores with the same quantities of drugs might be. Covington sentenced Arcentales to 10 years in federal prison and Castillo to just over 11.\u201cI had a terrible nightmare about the chains,\u201d Arcentales told me in the visitation room. \u201cI would wake up feeling the chains digging into my ankle and jerk my leg thinking I was shackled, and feel my leg free and be relieved that I was not chained there on the boat. I would wake up sweating; almost crying, thinking I was still chained. Over time it passes. But a thing like this, it never leaves you.\u201dIn the home that Arcentales had left behind, life is no less destitute than when he departed. Two weeks after Arcentales arrived in Florida, Mendoza opened a store in what was once their small sitting area, but it was a good day if it brought in $15. When I met her in Jaramij\u00f3, Mendoza welcomed me warmly into her home, which is crowded with her children and grandchildren and a flow of customers who step inside to buy diapers, plantains or cheese.Wladimir\u2019s court-appointed lawyer, Joaquin Mendez, argued in a federal court in Florida that the 31-day delay between his interdiction and his delivery to court in the United States was a violation of federal statutes requiring that defendants be arraigned within 30 days. \u201cThe Coast Guard made a calculated determination to continue on with their interdiction, to keep these individuals in the conditions that they were, while they\u2019re going about doing their business,\u201d Mendez told Judge James I. Cohn.For what may have been the first time in federal court, Cohn dismissed the indictment against Wladimir because of the delay. \u201cIf government\u2019s argument is taken to its logical extreme, an individual could be detained indefinitely for a federal crime as long as the government did not file a formal complaint,\u201d Cohn said in court. But he threw the case out \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d \u2014 a small embarrassment for federal attorneys, yet one that allowed them to file a new complaint. In late August, Wladimir was sentenced to 10 years.Seth Freed Wessler is an investigative journalist and a Puffin reporting fellow at the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute.Advertisement"}

Its tensions with its northern neighbor, China, have persisted for thousands of years \u2014 from a millennium of direct Chinese rule and a bloody border war in 1979 to more recent confrontations in the South China Sea.If geography is destiny, then the fate of Vietnam is to be an expert in bargaining with Beijing and balancing between superpowers.\u201cI would like to give advice to the whole world, and especially to the United States, that you must be careful with China,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Le Van Cuong, the retired director of the Institute of Strategic Studies at the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security.\u201cXi Jinping\u2019s ambitions are dangerous for the whole world,\u201d General Cuong said. \u201cChina uses its money to buy off many leaders, but none of the countries that are its close allies, like North Korea, Pakistan or Cambodia, have done well. Countries that are close to America have done much better. We must ask: Why is this?\u201dAs with other Southeast Asian nations acutely aware that they are positioned in China\u2019s backyard, Vietnam is worried about American inattention.In the name of halting Communism, the United States once sent troops to Indochina and propped up dictators elsewhere in Asia. But the American-devised security landscape also created a stable environment in which regional economies expanded.Now, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to take the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, which would have given 11 other economies an alternative to a Chinese-led economic order, has left the Vietnamese feeling vulnerable.\u201cAs Vietnamese, we are always trying to find a way to balance China\u2019s power,\u201d said Nguyen Ngoc Anh, a professor at the Foreign Trade University in Hanoi. \u201cFor us, TPP isn\u2019t just an economic issue. It\u2019s also about geopolitics and social issues.\u201d\u201cWe are both Communist countries, but people like me in Vietnam don\u2019t want to develop the same way that China has,\u201d said Ms. Anh, who studied economics in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia. \u201cWe want to follow the Western-oriented way.\u201dWhile the United States is the largest market for Vietnamese exports, Vietnam\u2019s biggest trading partner is China. Yet Vietnam runs a significant trade deficit with its populous neighbor, and Vietnamese economists worry that China doesn\u2019t play fairly.\u201cChina is one of the few countries in the world that doesn\u2019t observe international law in many areas,\u201d said Le Dang Doanh, an influential economist who has advised members of the Vietnamese Politburo on trade.But this national aversion puts Vietnam\u2019s leadership in a bind. It cannot ignore China\u2019s growing economic magnetism. For many members of APEC, China now ranks as their No. 1 trading partner.In return for investment and project financing \u2014 roads, railways, dams, airports and colossal government buildings \u2014 leaders of regional economies are increasingly doing Beijing\u2019s bidding.Cambodia and Laos have given crucial support for Beijing\u2019s South China Sea claims. Thailand has complied with Beijing\u2019s demand that it return Chinese dissidents who once counted on it as a haven.Since taking office last year, Mr. Duterte has deemed the era of American military and economic pre-eminence over, and has called China his country\u2019s best and faithful friend. He has been rewarded with billions of dollars in infrastructure investment from Beijing.\u201cThe U.S. has been playing catch-up to China\u2019s charm offensive since the turn of the new century,\u201d said Tang Siew Mun, who heads the Southeast Asia center at the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore.Vietnam, more than any other country, has grown practiced at divining when not to challenge the two Pacific powers \u2014 both of which it fought within the last half-century.In the 1970s and 1980s, China seized spits of land in the South China Sea that Vietnam had controlled or that were unoccupied but claimed by Hanoi.Yet perhaps sensing an American reluctance to confront China in the South China Sea, Vietnam has declined to take China to international court, as the Philippines did, even as the Chinese have turned disputed reefs and sandbars into militarized islands.Chinese pressure continues, despite the United States\u2019 supplying the Vietnamese Coast Guard with a cutter and new patrol boats.\u201cLiving next to China, which has ambitions to become the most powerful country in the world, is not easy,\u201d said Vo Van Tao, a popular political blogger. \u201cTo lower the heat, Vietnam needs to withdraw from areas that belong to Vietnam.\u201dGrand strategy is beyond the worldview of Vietnamese like Do Van Duc. In 1979, he was stationed on the border with China, as part of an antiaircraft artillery unit, when hundreds of thousands of People\u2019s Liberation Army soldiers from China flooded south.The Vietnamese, while outmanned, put up an unexpectedly robust defense. Within a month, the Chinese, professing that they had taught the Vietnamese a lesson for interfering in regional geopolitics, withdrew.During the war with China, Mr. Duc was only 17 years old, but he came to understand one thing then that today, as a security guard living in Hanoi, he said he still clings to.\u201cWe cannot trust the Chinese,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are our ancient enemy, and that will not change.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified two ships shown in the South China Sea.

{"Headline": "Self-Driving Trucks May Be Closer Than They Appear", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "With fewer cultural hurdles and more financial incentives than car owners, big-rig operators are charting the route to an autonomous future.Supported byTrucks will someday drive themselves out of warehouses and cruise down freeways without the aid of humans or even a driver\u2019s cab \u2014 about that there seems little disagreement. The question is how soon that day gets here.And while the answers vary \u2014 technologists, not surprisingly, are more bullish than truckers \u2014 billions of dollars and a growing parade of companies, from tiny start-ups to the country\u2019s biggest trucking operations, are betting it will be here sooner than most people think.This year, companies and investors are on pace to put just over $1 billion into self-driving and other trucking technologies, 10 times the level of three years ago, according to CB Insights, which tracks the venture capital industry.Tesla is widely expected this week to showcase an electric truck that will have some self-driving capabilities. And Embark, a Silicon Valley start-up, is set to announce on Monday that it has been testing its self-driving technology as part of a three-way partnership with the truck-leasing company Ryder and the appliance giant Electrolux.\u201cWe are trying to get self-driving technology out on the road as fast as possible,\u201d said Alex Rodrigues, Embark\u2019s chief executive. \u201cTrucking needs self-driving and self-driving needs trucking.\u201dUnlike autonomous cars, which face questions about navigating chaotic urban streets, trucks spend a lot of time heading straight on desolate highways. And while the advent of the self-driving car will rest on the decisions of individual consumers, logistics companies are unemotional operators that will upgrade their fleets the moment it makes financial sense.Trucking is a $700 billion industry that touches every corner of the economy. Trucks haul natural resources from mines and forests. They transport industrial building blocks from manufacturers and deliver goods to stores and homes. Virtually every physical product from food to paper towels and furniture has touched a truck several times by the time it gets to a consumer\u2019s hands.The industry\u2019s size makes it a fat target for automation. Autonomous technology will help trucking companies reduce labor costs in the long run, first by extending the number of hours trucks are in operation, and later, by reducing the number of drivers. The industry spends billions of dollars a year on accidents that are largely caused by human error, and billions more on insurance premiums that should go down if and when self-driving technology is proven to be safer than human drivers.Even companies not explicitly chasing the goal of self-driving trucks are moving steadily toward a more automated future. The 7,000-plus trucks owned by US Xpress, one of the nation\u2019s largest trucking companies, have been updated with autonomous braking and collision-avoidance systems. Max Fuller, the company\u2019s co-founder and executive chairman, plans to upgrade them to have automated lane steering in three years.\u201cI\u2019m putting building blocks into my trucks that each year gets us closer and closer,\u201d he said.Companies have a lot to get through before they can start legally operating trucks without drivers. Beyond technical and regulatory hurdles, the industry is sure to be challenged by wild cards like how human drivers react to seeing a unmanned truck gliding down the highway and how regulators respond when the inevitable first deadly autonomous-trucking accident occurs. If such a backlash were to happen before the technology has been widely adopted, it could slow things for years.But whenever self-driving trucks arrive, there will be economic ripples, affecting insurance premiums, truck stops, vocational schools and the roads themselves. \u201cThis is the most powerful thing to hit us since the building of the superhighways in the 1950s,\u201d said No\u00ebl Perry, an economist at FTR Research, which tracks the logistics industry.One afternoon in Florida, a 59-year-old career truck driver named Jeff Runions sat alertly in the cab of an 18-wheeler watching the road while his 11-ton cargo of stone tile made its way up the Ronald Reagan Turnpike. He was watching his steering wheel, too, but his hands were at his side: A computer was in control.Mr. Runions works for Starsky Robotics, a San Francisco start-up that for the past two years has been testing its self-driving technology by running freight up and down Florida. The runs help collect data and hone the technology, in hopes of convincing regulators and the company itself that self-driving trucks are ready for business.There are still plenty of kinks. Sitting next to Mr. Runions was an Irish engineer named Rebecca Feeney Barry. As the vehicle spent hours driving past swamps and billboards for accident lawyers, Ms. Feeney Barry balanced a laptop on her knees and watched how the truck\u2019s sensors interpreted the road and nearby cars.At one point the computer\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d briefly lost sight of the freeway because an overpass shaded the road. Later, the truck didn\u2019t take a turn hard enough, prompting Mr. Runions to grab the wheel. Ms. Feeney Barry logged all of it. Later, after some computer code had been altered to tell the truck to tug the wheel a bit harder, it made a similar turn more smoothly.\u201cSometimes it kind of messes me up when I go back to driving because now I\u2019m used to the truck driving,\u201d Mr. Runions said.Starsky\u2019s ultimate plan, of course, is to eliminate Mr. Runions\u2019s job. But they do not want him to be out of one. Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Starsky\u2019s 27-year-old chief executive, foresees using self-driving technology to replace long-haul drivers on freeways, but having people like Mr. Runions navigate at either end of the trip with remote control consoles that look like an arcade racing game.Drivers would go off to work in offices and might spend their day driving trucks through the last few miles of several different routes in several different cities before heading home for dinner.\u201cOne driver can drive 10 to 30 trucks per day,\u201d Mr. Seltz-Axmacher said.Starsky\u2019s vision of a remote operation is unique. But the basic idea \u2014 having trucks drive themselves on highways and letting human drivers take over in complicated city environments \u2014 is something of an industry consensus.\u201cOne of the big misconceptions about self-driving technology is that it is going to emerge and be able to drive all the time in all circumstances,\u201d said Alden Woodrow, the product manager for Uber\u2019s self-driving truck unit.As part of their partnership, Embark, Ryder and Electrolux are conducting what amounts to elaborate dry runs to imagine what self-driving-truck routes will look like. The runs start with human drivers leaving an Electrolux warehouse in El Paso and driving to the edge of the city, where they hitch the trailer to one of Embark\u2019s autonomous trucks.From there the truck drives itself for 650 highway miles (with a safety driver in tow) to Ontario, Calif., where the Embark drivers transfer their trailer to another Ryder driver, who drives the final few miles to one of Electrolux\u2019s California warehouses.\u201cIt\u2019s a mirror of what we would do if there weren\u2019t a driver inside,\u201d said Mr. Rodrigues, the Embark chief.A few miles from Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., a company called Peloton Technology is betting that there is a business to be built in a less radical version of automation. Peloton is on the cusp of rolling out a system that will make it easier and safer for trucks to travel one after the other on the highway, in a formation called platooning, helping them save gas by reducing wind drag.Trucks with drivers already do this. But Peloton\u2019s technology aims to make platooning safer with a mix of cameras, sensors and networking equipment, allowing the trucks to talk to each other and helping to prevent the second driver from ramming into the first truck after a sudden stop.Josh Switkes, the company\u2019s chief executive, said that because Peloton\u2019s technology helps drivers get better at doing something they are familiar with, he thinks it can be quickly commercialized.\u201cOur basic approach is let\u2019s bring real value to the fleet and society now,\u201d Mr. Switkes said.Given that trucks are likely to need drivers for some time, it\u2019s no wonder that self-driving companies are almost universally pitching themselves as a friendly partner instead of a job killer. \u201cYou increase productivity, but also make the job more attractive,\u201d Mr. Rodrigues said.And it\u2019s true: Trucking is a brutal job. Drivers endure long, tedious stretches where they are inactive but have to stay focused, and they spend weeks at a time away from home. For those and other reasons, the industry\u2019s biggest problem has been the scarcity and turnover of drivers, making it hard to keep up with shipping demand.\u201cWe see this as a solution to the driver shortage and being able to redeploy them to the jobs they actually want,\u201d said Chris Nordh, senior director of advanced vehicle technologies at Ryder.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that trucking will shed about 300,000 jobs per year \u2014 starting in 25 years. Clearly, that estimate is based on so many ifs that the precise number is not worth fretting over. The bigger point is that as technology gets better, it will start replacing jobs.When Amazon went public in 1997, there wasn\u2019t much worry about huge job losses. Today, online retail companies require about one employee per $1 million of annual sales, versus 3.5 employees per $1 million at physical stores \u2014 a big reason that retail employment is falling by about 100,000 jobs per year, according to the Goldman report.As the saying goes, predictions are hard \u2014 especially about the future. But you can learn a lot by looking at today\u2019s bets. Mr. Fuller, from US Xpress, has a 38-year-old son named Craig.Last year Craig Fuller founded a company called TransRisk, which recently announced a $3.4 million venture capital investment. TransRisk logs millions of transactions and other market data to help trucking companies predict prices along with future supply and demand. Craig Fuller\u2019s bet is that as trucking becomes more automated, trucks will be in motion longer and routed by artificial-intelligence systems.As that happens, he said, the business will be reshuffled. Companies like his father\u2019s \u2014 which exist, more or less, to manage armies of drivers \u2014 will compete with data companies that specialize in managing computers.\u201cWhen you take away the driver and have a business that is completely based on analytics, very few fleets will be able to survive that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m betting on data and information services. He\u2019s betting on owning equipment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ex-General Says U.A.E. Blocks His Return to Egypt to Run for President", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 The former Air Force general who narrowly lost Egypt\u2019s only free presidential election said Wednesday that the leaders of the United Arab Emirates were preventing him from leaving their country, seeking to block him from running again against President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\u201cI was surprised to find myself prevented from leaving our sister country,\u201d the former general, Ahmed Shafik, said in a videotaped statement from Dubai, where he has lived in exile with the support of the Emiratis since he lost the 2012 Egyptian presidential election. \u201cI reject interventions into the affairs of my country by preventing me from participating in a constitutional process and a sacred national mission.\u201dSuch restrictions on Mr. Shafik\u2019s travel would underscore the determination of the Emiratis to forestall any possible challenge to Mr. Sisi, another former general whose military takeover in 2013 the Emiratis strongly supported.Mr. Shafik could not be reached for comment on Wednesday night, and the limitations on his travel could not be confirmed. Dina Adly, a lawyer for Mr. Shafik, said that intermediaries for the Emirati authorities had told him to cancel a trip abroad because \u201crunning for president was a bad idea.\u201dMs. Adly said Mr. Shafik had been detained under house arrest since 3 a.m. on Friday. \u201cNow they will have to let him go,\u201d Ms. Adly said, as a result of the publicity generated by his video. \u201cSo this is good.\u201dAnwar Gargash, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 minister of state for foreign affairs, posted in a message on Twitter that there was \u201cno obstacle\u201d stopping Mr. Shafik from leaving and that the Emirates were \u201csad\u201d to learn that Mr. Shafik was ungrateful. \u201cWe facilitated matters for him and we have generously welcomed him, despite our strong reservations about some of his stances,\u201d Mr. Gargash wrote.Mr. Shafik, 76, had released an earlier video statement on Wednesday declaring his intention to enter the Egyptian presidential election expected next spring. That announcement introduced the first element of suspense into what had appeared would be an easy election victory for Mr. Sisi. The prospect of a contest between two military men would be the first public indication since Mr. Sisi took power of internal divisions within the ruling elite of officers, businessmen and security chiefs.\u201cA change of blood might be what is called for,\u201d Mr. Shafik said in the first video statement, citing the deep downturn in the Egyptian economy, the deterioration of public services and the accumulation of public debt.The Egyptian government might find other ways to thwart a Shafik candidacy. When he left Egypt after losing the 2012 presidential race, prosecutors were investigating corruption charges against him related to his tenure as the minister of civil aviation, a post he held for a decade beginning in 2001. Those charges might be revived to deter him from returning to Egypt or competing in the race.If he is able to return and run, Mr. Shafik\u2019s military record and well-known name may make him a strong candidate. He fought in Egypt\u2019s two wars with Israel, in 1967 and 1973, and rose to command the Air Force. As minister of civil aviation, he oversaw the successful modernization and development of both the national airline and the Cairo airport.He developed strong connections among the business elite, and he was widely discussed as a possible successor to former President Hosni Mubarak. In a bid to bolster his support during his last days in power in 2011, Mr. Mubarak had promoted Mr. Shafik to prime minister in the hope that he could resolve the crisis brought about by a popular uprising.Mr. Shafik lost the presidential election the next year by only about 2 percent of the vote. The winner was Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, whom Mr. Sisi removed from office in 2013.\u201cA true democracy and basic human rights are not grants from anyone,\u201d Mr. Shafik said in his video. \u201cIt is also not something that is granted or given gradually at all. You either have a democracy or you have no democracy.\u201d\u201cI know very well they will fix all the ballot boxes,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThis is going to be a comedy show.\u201dHe confirmed the authenticity of the recording but said he had meant only to criticize the military\u2019s open endorsement of Mr. Sisi, then the defense minister. Election officials said Mr. Sisi received more than 97 percent of the votes.Mr. Shafik stuttered or faltered at times during his video statement on Wednesday, which may remind Egyptians that he has had a reputation for absent-mindedness. His tenure as prime minister ended after just a few months in 2011 when he was forced to resign after losing his temper on a television talk show in a debate with a novelist, Alaa Al Aswany.\u201cI fought in the war!\u201d Mr. Shafik blustered. \u201cI killed and was killed!\u201dNour Youssef reported from Cairo, and David D.

{"Headline": "An Embattled North Carolina Seeks to Outrun a Law\u2019s Bitter Legacy", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina wanted its reputation back.Worn down by about a year of battles and boycotts, its leaders cut a deal in March to repeal a law that had restricted restroom access for transgender people. But North Carolina is finding that it is easier to plunge into a culture war than it is to leave one behind.\u201cThis isn\u2019t like the Cold War where it came, it went, it was over and people didn\u2019t worry about it anymore,\u201d a longtime Republican strategist, Carter Wrenn, said.The day-to-day debate, Democrats and Republicans often note, has receded, and the national uproar that buffeted North Carolina beginning in March 2016 has largely abated. Still, a battered and weary state is slogging through a landscape of residual damage that some observers warn will not fade quickly.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like one of those hangovers you get in college that lasts for a few days,\u201d said Matt Hirschy, the interim executive director of Equality North Carolina, an advocacy group. \u201cUnfortunately for us, it\u2019s going to last for a few years, at least.\u201dIn a state where partisan rancor is a bipartisan pastime, people still marvel at how quickly and broadly H.B. 2, which required people in publicly owned buildings to use the restroom that corresponded with the gender listed on their birth certificate, reshaped perceptions of North Carolina.The law was championed by Republicans, who argued that it was crucial to public safety and a rebuff to an overreaching city government in Charlotte, and attracted some Democratic support.The national outrage ebbed anyway, business groups and convention planners appeared mostly satisfied, and the N.C.A.A. relented.But, in a signal of how North Carolina has so far been unable to outrun the law\u2019s legacy, political tensions flared again last month when Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, proposed a settlement in related litigation. As part of the deal, Mr. Cooper agreed to declare that \u201ctransgender people are not prevented from the use of public facilities in accordance with their gender identity.\u201dThe General Assembly\u2019s leading Republicans, who either declined to comment or did not respond to interview requests, swiftly condemned the proposal as \u201ca stunt\u201d that proved that Mr. Cooper \u201cacted in bad faith and lied about wanting to end the focus on H.B. 2.\u201d (A federal judge in Winston-Salem is considering the proposed settlement.)Indeed, Republicans contend that any lingering discussion about the law and its repercussions is driven only by transgender rights activists, their elected allies and the news media.\u201cMost of us, including me, would just as soon move on,\u201d Mr. McCrory added.Mr. Cooper, who said in March that the repeal legislation \u201ccannot be the only step,\u201d defended his decisions and said, \u201cThey set the fire, and I\u2019m working to put it out.\u201d\u201cI think most North Carolinians believe we are moving in the right direction, but many of them know we still have more work to do,\u201d said Mr. Cooper, whose actions last month were timed for the day before the deadline for proposals for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. \u201cBut I believe that North Carolina is a welcoming place and a great state to do business. We have taken enough important steps to signal to the world that we\u2019re open for business, and it\u2019s pretty clear that businesses are responding in a positive way.\u201dStrategists on both sides of the debate agree that voters have tired of talk about H.B. 2, but there is no consensus on how much the law will influence next year\u2019s elections.\u201cI find it highly unlikely that you will find the national money trying to make North Carolina a cultural battleground state at the legislative level,\u201d said Art Pope, a conservative financier who served in Mr. McCrory\u2019s administration.\u201cI think the volume has been turned down,\u201d Mr. Hirschy of Equality North Carolina said. \u201cThe fervor is still there in our community, and if you ask our opponents, their fervor is still there.\u201dPerhaps so, to the possible political benefit of both sides. An influential group of religious conservatives recently produced an advertisement complaining that a candidate for mayor of Charlotte \u201cendorsed a radical, national L.G.B.T. agenda allowing men in women\u2019s locker rooms and bathrooms.\u201d The election is Tuesday.But for many of the state\u2019s transgender residents, estimated at nearly 45,000 by a research institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, H.B. 2\u2019s repercussions do not play out on television screens. They are reflected, transgender people said, in quick decisions about whether to have a second cup of coffee and in choices about how much to share about themselves in conversation.\u201cBefore, whether or not you identified yourself as being transgender to someone was based on whether or not you perceived them as an ally or someone who would be O.K. with it,\u201d said Candis Cox, an activist who is a transgender woman. \u201cNow, what we have is a climate in which you really have a lot of trepidation about trusting people because we have now seen that people can seem to have all of the support in the world for you but have ulterior motives.\u201dAnd there is a measured sense that the fury of the H.B. 2 debate could someday be rekindled. On this matter, at least, there is some agreement.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a kind of holding of the breath,\u201d Ms. Cox said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now because we were dealt this awful blow, and it\u2019s waiting for the other shoe to drop. We don\u2019t know where we are. The people who supported H.B. 2 \u2014 the citizens, the politicians \u2014 we know that they\u2019re still there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Trade, Trump Puts Corporate America First", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe latest round of North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations came to an end last week without a deal. It\u2019s not clear whether a compromise will be reached or President Trump will make good on his threat of pulling out. But we have seen enough of his approach to trade to know it is fundamentally mistaken and counterproductive.Mr. Trump is not wrong to think that trade agreements have shortchanged America as a whole while enriching corporate and financial interests. He was right to walk away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that was less about free trade and more about special privileges for investors, large companies and pharmaceutical businesses.Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on the bilateral trade deficit with Mexico is also a red herring. The overall trade deficit of the United States is determined primarily by macroeconomic factors \u2014 American consumers\u2019 saving propensities, domestic corporations\u2019 investment behavior and the federal government\u2019s fiscal and monetary policies. Trade policies with Mexico can do very little to alter this picture.But the biggest flaw of this administration\u2019s trade policy is that it falls squarely within the pervasive established mercantilist tradition. For mercantilists, the purpose of trade agreements is to open up other countries\u2019 economies to our companies to the maximum extent possible while minimizing how much we open up ours. Everybody else must adjust how their economy works, while we maintain our own ways. Under the guise of fairness to workers as a whole, this approach equates national interest with the profit-seeking behavior of United States corporations or protectionist groups.When trade agreements focused mostly on tariff and non-tariff barriers at the border, mercantilism produced some salutary consequences. Reaching agreement would require the United States to reduce its tariffs in return for other countries reducing theirs. International trade would be freer as a result.But today\u2019s trade deals are largely about domestic regulations and standards \u2014 the behind-the-border rules that purportedly stifle international commerce and investment. Mercantilism no longer has much of a silver lining. It now translates simply into investors and corporations getting their wish list fulfilled with the removal of any and all impediments to their cross-border activities.Of all the special interests that have shaped recent trade agreements, none has been as energetic in its lobbying, or more successful, than the pharmaceutical sector. A result has been the inclusion of ever stringent patent rules in trade agreements since the 1990s. Historically, patent laws have been enacted as an inducement to innovation, yet economists are increasingly skeptical that strong patents are necessary for that purpose. Euphemistically called \u201ctrade-related intellectual property rights,\u201d these protections serve mainly to transfer monopoly profits from global consumers to patent holders in the United States.Mr. Trump does pay lip service to upholding labor and environmental standards, which were shifted to side agreements in the original Nafta negotiations. But he has little interest in domestic policies that would really help those hurt by trade.A truly fairer globalization would start at home, with a reconstruction of the social compact that binds the corporate elite and the wealthy to labor and the middle class. Every society that opens itself up to the world economy needs social transfers, labor-training programs and regional policies that take care of the adversely affected workers and communities. Our domestic approach, over-reliant on underfunded and ineffective trade-adjustment assistance policies, has not worked and needs to be replaced by more extensive safety nets.These must be complemented with more progressive income taxation, employment-generating policies such as infrastructure investment and political reforms that reduce the role of money in politics. Mr. Trump and the Republicans want to take us in exactly the opposite direction, with a tax reform that will benefit the wealthy first and foremost.The problem with Mr. Trump\u2019s economic nationalism is not his avowed belief that trade should serve the national interest. When we economists teach the theory of trade, we emphasize that free trade is desirable because it expands the domestic economic pie \u2014 not because it confers gains to other nations. The problem is that he is deeply averse to the domestic policies that would allow American workers a piece of the added pie.International fairness in turn would require us to recognize that all countries have legitimate reasons to value their national sovereignty. Rules for finance or intellectual property that, for good or ill, prevail in the United States will frequently be unsuited to other countries. Our trade policy should not be driven by big banks and pharma companies that show very little concern for such considerations.Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to distance himself from special-interest globalization is perhaps not surprising. But it exposes the vacuity of his brand of populism. Despite all his talk about fairness and the need to stand up for ordinary working people, he has little to offer his core constituency. He will exacerbate, rather than mend, the grievances that made his presidency possible.Dani Rodrik is a professor of international political economy at the Harvard Kennedy School and the author of \u201cStraight Talk on Trade: Ideas for a Sane World Economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Votes to Proceed to Debate as Tax Overhaul Gains Steam", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 The spotlight now turns to the floor debate, which is limited to 20 hours.\u2022 President Trump gave a speech in Missouri touting his tax plan.\u2022 Some Republicans now say a \u201ctrigger\u201d mechanism under discussion should require automatic spending cuts, not tax increases.\u2022 Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah want to expand the child tax credit and proposed a corporate tax rate of 22 percent, not 20 percent as in Senate bill.\u2022 Republicans are now discussing allowing pass-through owners to deduct 20 percent of business income, up from 17.4 percent.The Senate will now begin a period of debate before a final vote on the plan.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, had urged his colleagues to move forward with the bill.\u201cThis is our chance to deliver relief for the people who\u2019ve sent us here, and the way we can do that is by voting to proceed to the bill,\u201d he said.In a sign of things to come, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Lee, both Republicans, said on Wednesday they would propose an amendment to expand the child tax credit while providing a slightly smaller corporate tax cut than currently proposed.\u201cWe have a chance to do better by working families in this tax bill,\u201d they said in a joint statement.While the Senate bill calls for dropping the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, from 35 percent, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Lee would set a rate of 22 percent.A spokesman for the White House, Raj Shah, said the president would not support the change that Mr. Rubio and Mr. Lee want.\u201cWe do support the child tax credit,\u201d Mr. Shah told reporters ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s speech in Missouri. \u201cWe also think that it\u2019s important to make businesses more competitive. We would not support raising the corporate rate as outlined in that amendment.\u201dThe current Senate plan allows pass-through owners to deduct 17.4 percent of business income as a way of lowering their tax rates. But Republicans now plan to boost the deduction to 20 percent, people familiar with the matter said.Before Wednesday\u2019s vote, Mr. Daines said that he had \u201cseen enough progress to vote yes to move the debate forward,\u201d alluding to the larger deduction.\u201cThere has been some good progress for Main Street businesses in the tax cut bill,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was able to secure more than $60 billion in tax cuts for Main Street businesses.\u201dNow the goal is a tax overhaul, and Mr. Moran cautioned against adding to the debt as a result of the legislation.But Mr. Moran said on Tuesday night that he supported the Senate plan.\u201cI expect to vote for the tax reform bill, but will continue to talk with my colleagues on ways to improve the legislation,\u201d he said in a statement.The latest idea among deficit-conscious Republicans is to install a \u201ctrigger\u201d in the bill that would cause taxes to rise if the anticipated revenue falls short.Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a deficit hawk who threatened to vote against the bill, said he had gotten assurances that such a provision would be inserted.This is shaping up to be the next big fight that Senate Republicans will face as some have bemoaned the concept as an automatic tax increase that ties their hands. The trigger is already proving to be a turnoff to conservative groups that have been pushing hard for tax cuts.\u201cA trigger that threatens tax hikes is a self-fulfilling threat to kill jobs,\u201d said Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, an anti-tax group.And Brent Gardner, the chief government affairs officer at the conservative activist group Americans for Prosperity, said such a plan would add complexity and uncertainty to the tax code that would stifle the economy.The debate over a proposed \u201ctrigger\u201d that would roll back tax cuts if revenues fall short of projections has shifted among Republican senators to a discussion over whether automatic discretionary spending cuts are the better way to go.On Wednesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said that some of his colleagues saw cuts to nonmilitary programs as preferable to rolling back the tax cuts if they do not bring sufficient economic growth. He said that Republicans are divided on the idea of a trigger and what it would affect, but acknowledged that lawmakers were wrestling with the idea hours before an important procedural vote.Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, opposes the concept of a trigger but prefers one that cuts spending to one that increases taxes.\u201cI would much prefer the idea of an automatic spending cut on the discretionary side,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said.Senator Bill Cassidy, the other Louisiana Republican, also appeared fond of the idea of using spending cuts as a safeguard in the bill.\u201cIt\u2019s intriguing isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.This is why overhauling taxes is so difficult: solving one problem often creates another.Mr. Trump went to Missouri today to tout his tax plan at a rally in St. Charles.Mr. Trump said United States has \u201c a once in a lifetime opportunity to restore American prosperity and reclaim America\u2019s destiny\u201d but that \u201c in order to achieve this bright and glowing future, the Senate must pass tax cuts and bring Main Street roaring back to life.\u201d\u201cOur focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and machine shops of America \u2014 the plumbers and the carpenters, the cops and the teachers, the truck drivers and the pipe fitters \u2014 all of the people who give their best each and every day to take care of their family and the country they love. It is not enough for the middle class to keep getting by \u2014 we want them to start getting ahead.\u201dSenate Republicans\u2019 tax cut would not pay for itself, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.After months of claiming that they believe in dynamic scoring, Senate Republicans may get such an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation on Wednesday.The committee said that it was working to release an assessment by late Wednesday that would show the economic effects of the proposed tax cuts and the additional revenue that could be generated from accelerated economic growth.The analysis could be a last obstacle for Republican deficit hawks if it shows that the tax cuts would not, in fact, pay for themselves even with economic growth. Several Republicans dismissed that possibility on Tuesday, suggesting that they were confident that the plan would be revenue neutral or insisting that they did not want to get into hypotheticals before the release of the report.President Trump said on Tuesday that the tax bill will prompt trillions of dollars currently held offshore to come flooding back to the United States since it will allow companies to bring profits home, at greatly reduced tax rates.American companies would no longer owe full taxes on overseas profits. Instead, they would pay taxes at a minimum rate of at least 10 percent on some types of foreign profits \u2014 compared with a new, lower rate on domestic earnings of 20 percent down from 35 percent.Mr. Trump predicts \u201clots of good things are going to happen, including the bringing back to our country of \u2014 probably will end up being over $4 trillion \u2014 money offshore that\u2019s stagnant that companies \u2014 they\u2019re just not able to bring it back. So I think it\u2019s going to be a number over $4 trillion.\u201dThe American Jobs Creation Act provided a one-time tax break for companies that wanted to repatriate their offshore profits. Companies brought home $312 billion at a rate of just 5.25 percent. Although the break was intended to spur investment and hiring, a plethora of studies showed that companies responded by spending billions buying back their shares, lifting their stock prices, and didn\u2019t expand their American work forces.Pfizer, for example, brought home $37 billion at the reduced rates \u2014 and shed 10,000 workers. Hewlett-Packard repatriated more than $14 billion, while eliminating more than 14,000 jobs.Economists agree a lower tax rate will incentivize companies to return money to the United States but it remains to be seen whether that translates into economic benefits.Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, declined on Wednesday to assess the Republican tax plan.Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee, Ms. Yellen said the Fed would welcome changes in fiscal policy that increased the capacity of the American economy, for example by encouraging increased business investment.But she said that it was up to Congress and the White House to evaluate the details of proposed changes.\u201cLooking at the likely impact of the particular proposals that may be under consideration is something that we haven\u2019t done carefully at the Federal Reserve,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen also said that the Fed would evaluate changes in fiscal policy in deciding how quickly to raise interest rates. The Fed could seek to dampen the effects of tax cuts by raising rates more quickly.Fed officials have drawn a careful distinction between changes that increase economic capacity, for example by encouraging business investment, and changes that provide a short-term sugar high, for example cuts in personal income taxes that are likely to increase spending.The Fed estimates that the economy is already growing at something close to the maximum sustainable pace, so a short-term boost might simply drive up inflation.\u201cWe welcome strong growth,\u201d Ms. Yellen told Congress. \u201cThe Fed is not trying to stifle growth. We\u2019re worried about trends that could push inflation above our 2 percent objective.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Simple Fix for Our Massive Inequality Problem", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEveryone knows that we are again living in a Gilded Age.More controversial is the question of what should be done about it. We seem stuck in the same policy equilibrium we have been in for decades, with conservatives denying that there is a problem and pushing policies that would make it even worse, liberals emphasizing the need for education and skills development, and leftists pushing for a unionized labor market and social-democratic welfare state.Some of these ideas are good ones, which would make life better for vulnerable people. But they\u2019d do little to directly target inequality in our society or to capture all the benefits that economic fairness brings.The solution is simpler than it seems. There\u2019s a tried and tested way, within the system we have now, of giving everyone a share in the investment returns now hoarded by the wealthy. It\u2019s called a social wealth fund, a pool of investment assets in some ways like the giant index or mutual funds already popular with retirement savings accounts or pension funds, but one owned collectively by society as a whole. One that paid dividends not to the few, or even just to the shrinking middle class lucky enough to have their savings invested, but to everyone.Here\u2019s how it could work. The federal government would create and run a new investment fund, and issue every adult citizen one share of ownership. The fund would gradually come to own a substantial and diverse portfolio of stocks, bonds and real estate. The investment return that the fund generates would be paid out to each citizen in the form of a universal basic dividend, and the shares would be nontransferable to preserve the institution\u2019s egalitarian purpose.The key challenge in building a social wealth fund is not how to run it once it has been created, but how to bring assets into the fund in the first place. Alaska and Norway were able to dedicate the proceeds from natural resource exploitation to that purpose, but most governments seeking to duplicate their efforts would need to look elsewhere for the money.Wouldn\u2019t the enormous wealth that our increasingly productive society is generating, which now flows into just a few pockets, be a fair source? Some of the concrete ways this could happen are through the transfer of existing federal assets like land, buildings and portions of the wireless spectrum into the new fund. Other measures could include increases in taxes on capital that affect mostly the wealthy such as estate, dividend and financial transaction taxes and the creation of a new type of corporate tax that requires companies to directly issue new shares to the social wealth fund on an annual basis and during certain corporate moves such as initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions.Creating a social wealth fund in which we all own an equal part is certainly not the only way to tackle wealth inequality directly, but it is one of the few ways that we know works well and is able to work within the system we now have. If policymakers want to get serious about trimming wealth concentration, and not just use these shocking statistics to promote the same old half-measures, then this would be a fair, effective and practical way to start.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Offers Bond Swap in a Charge Toward Financial Freedom", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreece, long the problem child of the eurozone, took a major step on Wednesday toward securing financial independence as it prepares to wean itself off the international bailouts that have kept it afloat for the last eight years.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras yearns for the day he is able to regularly sell Greek bonds to foreign investors, thus cutting the country\u2019s ties to financial lifelines. That would also have the effect of helping persuade the European Central Bank to buy Greek bonds as part of its huge regional stimulus program \u2014 something the bank has refused to do for years \u2014 and further improve Greece\u2019s finances.\u201cThe return to capital markets is part of the belated success story narrative that the Greek government together with the European Central Bank and the European Commission are trying to create,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economics consultant based in Athens and a former member of the European Commission\u2019s task force on Greece.The initial bonds were issued after a 2012 restructuring of Greek debt that forced private investors to take significant losses. The new bonds will most likely be more liquid \u2014 and easier to buy and sell \u2014 creating more incentive for big Wall Street investors like Pimco and Franklin Templeton to buy them.The swap will only work, however, if the existing bondholders agree to sell. The Greek government set a deadline of Nov. 28 for offers.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Still, the offer has already had an effect. As news of the swap seeped into financial markets, Greece\u2019s bond yields have come down sharply, to around 5 percent \u2014 a long way from the 22-plus percent rates that investors required the government to pay out because of the risk of buying its bonds at the height of the crisis. As a result, the country may be able to borrow at relatively low interest rates in the future.At present, a calmer climate has returned to Greece after years of financial drama, attracting the attention of investors. American companies and financial firms in particular have intensified their searching for deals as the Greek economy has shown signs of stabilizing.Yet despite interest by international investors in the possibility of reaping rich rewards from investing in Greek debt, the country\u2019s economy continues to struggle, Mr. Bastian said, adding that the success story narrative is \u201coverstated.\u201dLast week, the Greek finance ministry lowered its economic growth projection for this year from 1.8 percent to 1.6 percent. Unemployment has declined \u2014 from 27 percent at the height of the crisis to 21 percent today \u2014 but it is still the worst in the 19-nation eurozone.Banks are still loath to lend, and nonperforming loans on banks\u2019 balance sheets continue to block a recovery, Mr. Bastian said. That has had an outsize impact on small- and medium-sized businesses, which are the motor of the Greek economy.And for average Greeks still struggling to recover from years of hardship, this latest maneuver to please Greece\u2019s foreign creditors held little meaning.Mania Kouvari, 46, a teacher at a Greek state school, saw the bond issue as an attempt to distract public opinion from the fact that Greeks remain largely under foreign supervision \u2014 recent tranches of bailout funds have required, as a condition, painful austerity to be passed by Parliament \u2014 and indebted to international powers.\u201cThey are trying to show a positive image so that people invest in Greece and everything looks normal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut under the surface things aren\u2019t normal. People are struggling.\u201dMs. Kouvari said her own salary had been cut three times over the past seven years and that one of her two children was unemployed. \u201cIs that a success story?\u201d she said.Stelios Arvanitis, 68, a retiree, said his grandchildren were \u201cworking for peanuts.\u201d\u201cThey have no real future here,\u201d he said \u201cAnd then the government tells us about bonds. It has no bearing on our lives. And we\u2019re still going to be in debt for years to come.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis and Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Crown Prince\u2019s Mass Purge Upends a Longstanding System", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe arrests, ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman without formal charges or any legal process, were presented as a crackdown on corruption. They caught both the kingdom\u2019s richest investor, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, and the most potent remaining rival to the crown prince\u2019s power: Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, a favored son of the late King Abdullah.Prince Mutaib had been removed from his post as chief of a major security service just hours before the arrests announced late Saturday night.All members of the royal family were barred from leaving the country, American officials tracking the developments said on Sunday.With the new detentions, Crown Prince Mohammed, King Salman\u2019s favored son and key adviser, now appears to have established control over all three Saudi security services \u2014 the military, internal security services and national guard. For decades they had been distributed among branches of the House of Saud clan to preserve a balance of power in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East\u2019s biggest oil producer and an important American ally.In the same stroke, the crown prince has cowed businessmen and royals across the kingdom by taking down the undisputed giant of Saudi finance. And over the last several weeks he has ordered enough high-profile arrests of intellectuals and clerics to frighten the remainder of the academic and religious establishment into acceding to his will as well.Apolitical scholars who used to speak freely in cafes now look nervously over their shoulders, as Crown Prince Mohammed has achieved a degree of dominance that no ruler has attained for generations.\u201cIt is the coup de gr\u00e2ce of the old system,\u201d said Chas W. Freeman, a former United States ambassador. \u201cGone. All power has now been concentrated in the hands of Mohammed bin Salman.\u201dWhy the crown prince acted now \u2014 whether to eliminate future opposition or perhaps to crush some threat he saw brewing \u2014 was not immediately clear.Saudi Arabian businessmen and royals anxious about the crown prince\u2019s plans were quietly moving assets out of the country even before the arrests.\u201cSome of these are businessmen with international status, and if they are caught in this web then it could happen to anyone,\u201d said James M. Dorsey, who studies Saudi Arabia at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \u201cHow is that going to inspire confidence and attract foreign investment?\u201dThe Saudi Arabian news media, however, celebrated the arrests as a long-awaited cleanup, appealing to populist resentment of self-enrichment enjoyed by the sprawling royal family and its closest allies.Almost everyone in the capital, Riyadh, and other big cities like Jidda has heard stories about princes absconding with vast sums that had been allocated for a public project.The arrests are \u201ca frontal assault on some members of the royal family and the impunity with which they have operated in the past,\u201d said Bernard Haykel, a professor at Princeton University who studies Saudi Arabia.\u201cIt was something that had to be done,\u201d he said, even though the absence of a judicial process \u201csends a chill down the spine of foreign investors.\u201dThree White House advisers, including the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, returned just days ago from the latest in at least three high-level Trump administration visits to Saudi Arabia this year.Nearly 24 hours after the arrests were announced, no Saudi authority or spokesman had identified those arrested or the charges against them.The Saudi-owned satellite network Al Arabiya reported only that a large number of arrests, including 11 princes, had been ordered by an \u201canticorruption committee\u201d that just hours earlier had been formed under the direction of Crown Prince Mohammed. A royal decree granted the committee powers to detain individuals or seize assets without any trial, process or disclosure.A list of those arrested began circulating over social media shortly after midnight Sunday, and by Sunday evening senior government officials were reposting the list. News organizations around the region were reporting its contents without contradiction by either the Saudi government or individuals.In the case of the most politically potent of the detainees, the former security chief Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the Saudi government appeared on Sunday to have started a social media campaign seeking to make him the new face of public corruption.Analysts said the list appeared to reflect individuals with a reputation for self-enrichment and those representing rival power centers within the kingdom. Others included the power broker who once ran the royal court under King Abdullah, and the owner of one of the biggest private media companies in the region.But another was a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed himself \u2014 Adel Fakeih \u2014 who had been considered a driving force behind the ambitious program of economic reform, leaving analysts puzzled about the motives.The history of the House of Saud was sometimes punctuated by violent intrafamily strife in the decades before the founding of the modern dynasty, in 1932. Since then, the family has maintained its unity in part by spreading its top government roles and vast oil wealth among different branches of the sprawling clan. Most important was the division of the three main security services, which constitute the hard power on the ground.Michael Stephens, who studies Saudi Arabia at the Royal United Services Institute in London, recalled the bloody purges other leaders in the region have sometimes used to eliminate rivals. What Crown Prince Mohammed was doing, Mr. Stephens said, \u201cis a more genteel way of making sure there are no challenges to your power.\u201dTime will tell, Mr. Stephens said, whether the arrests signal a slide into despotism or \u201cwhether we will look back and say Mohammed bin Salman is the one guy who saw the wall coming and managed to hurdle it.\u201dReporting was contributed by Declan Walsh from Cairo, Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow, Ben Hubbard from Marib, Yemen, Nicholas Kulish from New York, Eric Schmitt from Washington and Mark Landler from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mugabe Ignores Resignation Deadline, Putting Pressure on Parliament", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 Former loyalists of President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe vowed on Monday to begin impeachment proceedings against him, after he ignored their ultimatum demanding that he step down.The protracted negotiations between military leaders who seized power on Wednesday and Mr. Mugabe have frustrated Zimbabweans who had hoped for a quick resolution to the standoff, most likely involving Mr. Mugabe\u2019s resignation and, perhaps, exile. If the military was hoping that the party\u2019s intervention might end the standoff, such hopes appeared to be dashed on Monday.\u201cThe Zimbabwe Defense Forces and security services are encouraged by new developments, which include contact between the president and former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is expected in the country shortly,\u201d the army commander, Gen. Constantino Chiwenga, told journalists. \u201cThe nation will be advised on the outcome of talks between the two.\u201dCritics of Mr. Mugabe, including onetime allies who have quickly turned against him, expressed impatience with the delay.\u201cWe want him out of office immediately,\u201d Christopher Mutsvangwa, the powerful head of the war veterans association, said at a news conference on Monday, urging governing party lawmakers to work with the opposition to remove the president.Despite such calls, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s swift removal is running into obstacles.For one, the impeachment process has never been tested in Zimbabwe, as Mr. Mugabe is the only president the country has known since becoming an independent nation in 1980. Under the Constitution, removing the president from office requires the assent of two-thirds of lawmakers in both the Senate and the National Assembly. ZANU-PF holds such a supermajority in both chambers, though a number of its members remain loyal to Mr. Mugabe.Military officers have insisted their takeover was not a coup, and have tried to give their intervention a veneer of legality \u2014 portraying it as an attempt to save the ailing Mr. Mugabe from a faction led by his wife, Grace, that had effectively seized control of the government.But to complete this picture of legality, they need Mr. Mugabe\u2019s cooperation \u2014 a fact that the president clearly understands and is exploiting as he reportedly negotiates his future and that of his family.The quandary also helps explain the continued absence of Mr. Mnangagwa, who had been engaged in a long-running feud with the president\u2019s wife. Mr. Mugabe had taken his wife\u2019s side by firing Mr. Mnangagwa and then trying to have the nation\u2019s top military commander, General Chiwenga, arrested. That led to the military intervention.Military leaders have taken great pains to remove any trace of Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s involvement in the intervention itself, clearly believing that it would damage him politically as he moves to succeed Mr. Mugabe.His absence has become conspicuous, leaving some allies struggling to explain.Tshinga Dube, a former war veterans minister and an ally of Mr. Mnangagwa, said the former vice president was still in South Africa on Monday. Asked why he had not returned after being named the new head of ZANU-PF, Mr. Dube said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s only yesterday.\u201dQuestioned as to whether Mr. Mnangagwa would return soon, Mr. Dube said: \u201cYes, yes, very soon. Maybe even this week, maybe.\u201dSimon Khaya Moyo, ZANU-PF\u2019s spokesman, said he had \u201cno idea\u201d when Mr. Mnangagwa would return. Asked why the party\u2019s new leader had not returned already, Mr. Moyo replied testily, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dOn Nov. 6, some hours after he was fired, Mr. Mnangagwa decided to flee Zimbabwe, fearing arrest or worse, according to allies. In an escape worthy of his background as a liberation war veteran and his nickname, the Crocodile, he apparently outmaneuvered Mr. Mugabe\u2019s security forces, though he came very close to being caught.Mr. Mnangagwa had private planes belonging to friends ready to take off at the airport, creating the impression that he would fly out of Zimbabwe, said Mr. Mutsvangwa, the head of the war veterans association. Instead, Mr. Mnangagwa drove in a single vehicle toward neighboring Mozambique, where he has strong military ties, accompanied by a son and a young assistant.Wearing a cap, Mr. Mnangagwa, 75, had his passport stamped at the border, but was then recognized by a police officer, Mr. Mutsvangwa said. Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s son, a soldier, disarmed the officer, and their vehicle made a U-turn, speeding back into Zimbabwe. After a while, they stopped by the roadside. The young assistant drove the car back to Harare as Mr. Mnangagwa and his son left Zimbabwe on foot.\u201cIt\u2019s a land border, there\u2019s no river, so they just used a bush path,\u201d Mr. Mutsvangwa said. \u201cSo he walked into Mozambique, and, of course, Mozambican friends were waiting for him on the other side.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy, he\u2019s not young anymore,\u201d Mr. Mutsvangwa said.\u201cThe way Mugabe has been running this country is the same way Mnangagwa is going to do it,\u201d said Catherine Mukwapati, 34, who was walking in central Harare with her 3-year-old daughter.Claris Madhuku, 38, who was sitting on a bench in Africa Unity Square, said he was skeptical of Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s close ties to the military. The former vice president, he added, had emerged victorious over a rival faction because his own \u201cjust fortunately won the backing of the army.\u201dStill, Mr. Madhuku was hopeful that the economy would improve under Mr. Mnangagwa, who has a reputation for pragmatism and for being open to outside investors.\u201cHe will likely be a reformist in as far as the economy is concerned,\u201d Mr. Madhuku said. \u201cI just hope he will not continue with Mugabe\u2019s destructive policies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.I. Will Transform the Economy. But How Much, and How Soon?", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are basically three big questions about artificial intelligence and its impact on the economy: What can it do? Where is it headed? And how fast will it spread?Three new reports combine to suggest these answers: It can probably do less right now than you think. But it will eventually do more than you probably think, in more places than you probably think, and will probably evolve faster than powerful technologies have in the past.This bundle of research is itself a sign of the A.I. boom. Researchers across disciplines are scrambling to understand the likely trajectory, reach and influence of the technology \u2014 already finding its way into things like self-driving cars and image recognition online \u2014 in all its dimensions. Doing so raises a host of challenges of definition and measurement, because the field is moving quickly \u2014 and because companies are branding things A.I. for marketing purposes.Each of the three research initiatives has a somewhat different focus. But two common themes emerge from the reports and interviews with their authors.\u25a0 Technology itself is only one ingredient in determining the trajectory of A.I. and its influence. Economics, government policy and social attitudes will play major roles as well.\u25a0 Historical patterns of adoption of major technologies, from electricity to computers, are likely to hold true for A.I. But if the pattern is similar, the pace may not be. And if it is much faster, as many researchers predict, the social consequences could be far more wrenching than in past transitions.The group was initially going to publish major studies every five years. But given the speed of progress and investment, the five-year interval \u201cseemed way too slow,\u201d said Yoav Shoham, a professor emeritus at Stanford and chair of the steering committee for the \u201cAI Index.\u201dThe new index is not a single number, but a series of charts and graphs that track A.I.-related trends over time. They include measures like the rate of improvement in image identification and speech recognition, as well as start-up activity and job openings. There are also short essays by artificial intelligence experts.Some of the charts showing the progress of technology are telling. Image and speech recognition programs, for example, have matched or surpassed human capabilities in just the past year or two.But A.I. experts warn that gains in specific tasks or game-playing proficiency are still a far cry from general intelligence. A child, for example, knows that a water glass tipping on the edge of a table will most likely fall to the floor and spill the water. He or she understands the physics of everyday life in a way artificial intelligence programs do not yet.\u201cThe public thinks we know how to do far more than we do now,\u201d said Raymond Perrault, a scientist at SRI International, who worked on the index.The current \u201cAI Index,\u201d Mr. Shoham said, is \u201cvery much a first step.\u201d The group is seeking contributions of data and comments from academic and corporate researchers around the world. The idea, he said, is to create \u201ca living index\u201d that details as many measurable dimensions of the field as possible, including social impact.The McKinsey automation-and-jobs report captures the uncertainty surrounding A.I. and its coming effect on labor markets. Its projection of the number of Americans who will have to find new occupations by 2030 ranges from 16 million to 54 million \u2014 depending on the pace of technology adoption.The faster A.I. advances, the greater the challenge. McKinsey\u2019s upper-range projection of 54 million suggests a more rapid transformation than in previous waves of change in the work force, when employment migrated from farms to factories and later from manufacturing to services.\u201cThat\u2019s where the conversation has to go \u2014 how to manage this transition,\u201d said Susan Lund, an economist at McKinsey. \u201cWe need a major change in how we provide midcareer retraining and how we help displaced workers find new employment.\u201dStill, the rise of A.I. has not yet shown up in the economy as a whole, at least not in the numbers. In their recent paper, Erik Brynjolfsson and Daniel Rock of the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and Chad Syverson of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business call it \u201ca clash of expectations and statistics.\u201dThey offer a few possible explanations, including false hopes and poor measurements of the new technology. But the one they settle on is a lag in the adoption and effective use of A.I.A.I. will follow a similar path, but faster, predicts Mr. Brynjolfsson, who also worked in the \u201cAI Index.\u201d And the index, he said, should help accelerate adoption by giving people needed information to make better decisions.There are A.I. skeptics, but Mr. Brynjolfsson is not one of them. \u201cHistory shows it takes years, even with a powerful technology in place,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to me, it\u2019s dead certain it\u2019s going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robbing Blue States to Pay Red", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsMuch of the debate over the Republican House and Senate tax plans has centered on how they will shift income toward the affluent. But there is a second kind of redistribution in the plans \u2014 from Democratic blue states to Republican red states.The other major tax break in the cross hairs of House Republicans is the home mortgage interest deduction. As with local taxes, all the states that have an above-average number of homes that would be affected by the deduction cap in the House bill voted for Mrs. Clinton. (The Senate version doesn\u2019t include this provision.)Some of the pay-fors aimed at blue states look even more gratuitous. The House bill would phase out certain deductions for personal casualty losses \u2014 but \u201cgrandfathers\u201d victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, though not the horrific California fires.In sum, Republicans have put the majority of their tax cuts on the nation\u2019s credit card, but they\u2019ve handed most of the rest of the bill to blue states.To see just how unusual that approach is, think back to 2009, when President Barack Obama briefly had a filibuster-proof Democratic majority in the Senate. Did he use it to shift spending away from red states? Hardly. His signature accomplishment, the Affordable Care Act, was most generous to poorer states, where more people lacked insurance \u2014 that is, red states.This effect was of course blunted by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that states could refuse the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion and blunted further by the unwillingness of many red states to accept the expansion\u2019s extremely generous terms. Even so, struggling parts of red America have come to depend heavily on Medicaid and other safety-net programs expanded by Democrats in 2009 and 2010.The A.C.A.\u2019s universalistic approach has been the norm for a simple reason: National parties represent coalitions of local representatives that cut across state lines. Despite distinctive regional bases, the two major parties have generally featured a significant degree of geographic diversity, so partisan majorities had no political reason to systematically extract resources from some regions to the benefit of others.As with other lines of division in American politics, however, the geographic lines have been hardening. Today, blue-state Republicans and red-state Democrats are much less common. As the political scientist David Hopkins has pointed out, the 15 coastal and Northeastern states that now form the Democrats\u2019 geographic stronghold send only two Republicans to the Senate. The trends in the House are similar, with the Republican majority containing fewer and fewer seats in solidly blue states.But Democrats haven\u2019t sought big transfers toward \u201ctheir\u201d states. Why are Republicans distinctive? Because of a second crucial feature of our federal system: Parties get rewarded not just for winning over specific people but also for winning in specific places. Because Republicans are stronger in the most sparsely populated areas, they possess a growing structural advantage. This, in turn, increases their incentive and capacity to favor red over blue states.The Republicans\u2019 advantage stems from two main sources. First, the overrepresentation of less-populous states in the Senate has become more consequential as the population gap between crowded and rural states grows and as rural states become more solidly Republican. Second, the increasing concentration of Democratic voters in urban areas \u2014 and Republican gerrymandering to exploit this \u2014 means more and more Democratic votes are \u201cwasted\u201d on easy wins. As a consequence, Republicans in both the House and the Senate can lose the national popular vote and still control a majority of seats. Democrats, by contrast, still need to win some red regions of the country.Republican leaders are betting that enough blue-state Republicans will put loyalty to party ahead of the prosperity of their state \u2014 or at least recognize that the first part of the Republican two-step (big tax cuts for rich people in blue as well as red states) may redound to their benefit even if the second (pay-fors aimed at blue states) doesn\u2019t.But if their bet pays off, it isn\u2019t just blue states that will suffer. Red America may hold the key to Republicans\u2019 control of government, but blue America holds many of the keys to our nation\u2019s economic future. Indeed, among the blue-state pay-fors, the most troubling may be those that will bleed institutions of higher education, particularly in the House bill. In their zeal to extract revenues from blue states, Republicans are threatening our nation\u2019s ability to excel in a global knowledge economy.The moral of Civil War pensions is cautionary. Pensions for Union veterans devolved into a spectacularly corrupt system that undermined political support for much-needed universal social policies. High tariffs outlived their utility and helped incite a global trade war in the 1930s. It took the Great Depression to unleash new social programs and major federal investment in the South. Republicans should think twice before succumbing to the dangerous appeal of territorial tribalism again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trumpification of Ed Gillespie", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEd Gillespie has emerged as a one-stop power broker. He advises top White House officials, works for GOP campaigns, lobbies for major corporations and opines on political talk shows.a bipartisan culture shift in Washington, in which influence-peddlers don\u2019t have to limit themselves to one, two or even three high-profile roles.With that background in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the current Virginia gubernatorial campaign.Before the Republican primary last June, Gillespie was running as the leader of the Republican establishment in Virginia, aloof from the turmoil in the Trump wing of the party.But just like the polls that called the presidential election for Hillary Clinton, the pre-primary polls in Virginia underestimated the pro-Trump vote and failed to anticipate the populist groundswell in the state.are sick and tired of the wishy-washy, weak-kneed, establishment Republicans who don\u2019t stand for anything.Gillespie got the message loud and clear: The populist right-wing was much stronger than he had thought. If a substantial number of the 155,466 voters for Stewart stayed home on Nov. 7, the Gillespie campaign was dead.it would be a shame \u2014 that I put in all the time I did, and all of you folks put in all the time you did, and we all across America worked as hard as we could to send Donald Trump to Washington, D.C., to drain the swamp, and send a lobbyist to Richmond.Northam cast the deciding vote in favor of sanctuary cities that let illegal immigrants who commit crimes back on the street, increasing the threat of MS-13.In fact, there are no sanctuary cities in Virginia.Last year, Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam instituted the automatic restoration of rights for violent felons and sex offenders, making it easier for them to obtain firearms and allowing them to serve on juries. One of these felons, John Bowen, had his rights restored two months after being found with one of the largest child pornography collections in Virginia\u2019s history.Technically, it is true that Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s policy, which Mr. Northam backs, made it easier for Mr. Bowen to obtain firearms, serve on juries and vote. In fact, there were no elections in the 41-day window during which he regained his rights, and as a former felon he would have needed a judge\u2019s approval to obtain a gun. Nor was there time for him to be summoned and serve on a jury. Mr. Gillespie, determined to inflame and distract voters, could not be bothered with such details. Once known as a pragmatist and a centrist, Mr. Gillespie increasingly has been turning in his political advertising to President Trump\u2019s brand of divisive, scaremongering politics.Ralph Northam, who is running for Governor of Virginia, is fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs & sanctuary cities. Vote Ed Gillespie!Ed Gillespie will turn the really bad Virginia economy #\u2019s around, and fast. Strong on crime, he might even save our great statues/heritage!John Feehery, a lobbyist who worked at Quinn Gillespie, wrote in an email that Trump\u2019s support may hurt Gillespie in the suburbs around Washington, D.C., but ithelps immeasurably in the rest of the State. Thanks to Trump\u2019s endorsement, the places that Ed most needs to get excited will get excited. So this works out well for Gillespie.Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, was more emphatic:Let\u2019s put it this way: If Trump weren\u2019t supportive of Gillespie, it would drive a stake into the heart of Gillespie\u2019s candidacy. It\u2019s a fine line. Gillespie needs to be acceptable enough to the Trump voters so that they\u2019ll actually show up to vote. Few will back Northam, so just getting them excited enough to cast a ballot is enough. Gillespie\u2019s TV ad emphasis on immigration, crime, and commutations appears to have tipped the Trump base into Gillespie\u2019s column \u2014 assisted by Trump\u2019s supportive tweets. They\u2019re not running to the polls like last year, but walking gets them there too.Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by \u201cthe American dream\u201d?This attack is not just an attack on my supporters, who are good, decent, hardworking Virginians who love their neighbors, it is an attack on all Virginians.David Turner, communications director for the Northam campaign, countered:Ed Gillespie has spent upwards of $9 million making obvious racial appeals. Ed Gillespie has stoked fear among Hispanic immigrants. He turned on the stove and now the water is boiling over.But, Turner added,Ralph Northam would not have run this ad and believes Virginians deserve civility, not escalation. Dr. Northam is committed to unifying Virginians to appeal to their hopes, rather than dividing them through fear.The ad was pulled late in the day on Oct. 31.If painting Northam as a friend to violent Salvadoran gangs and pedophiles seems like a stretch, that\u2019s American politics in 2017. We used to think that however grotesque they were, there was still a difference between overt declarations and explicit racial politics on one hand and dog whistles and implicit racial politics on the other. That distinction seems to be fading, if it is not gone altogether. Whether the Gillespie-Trump brand of Republicanism sells to the Virginia electorate this year will tell us a lot about where American politics stand a year after the election of President Trump \u2014 and the outcome will also offer tantalizing hints about where we are headed in 2018 and 2020.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocratic leaders in Washington have been criticized for lacking a message that voters can embrace. They have been disparaged as too old and too wedded to the zero sum politics of this polarized era. So we looked outside the nation\u2019s capital to ask leaders in states and cities to offer their vision for reconnecting with voters who have left the party and propelled Republicans into control of the White House and Congress.All of them agreed that the party needed to focus on matters that are urgent and relevant in the lives of ordinary Americans, rather than engaging in daily firefights with Republicans and President Trump.Here is what they had to say. Some of the interviews were edited for brevity and clarity.Gov. Jay Inslee of WashingtonThere are three pillars of our future success. One, we have found that a very consistent first step is talking about jobs and economic growth. Consistently focusing on jobs with a capital \u201cJ\u201d and a plan to deliver jobs will serve us well. Second, you cannot overstate the appetite, desire and thirst for some sense of unity, and just rationality, as opposed to the divisiveness and chaos that this president has brought.There is such a strong distaste for the madness coming out of the White House that simply showing a sense of rationality is very appealing to people right now.The third issue is that the states are the place where Donald Trump cannot stop us. He cannot stop our clean energy jobs programs. He cannot stop our ways to finance college for the middle class. He cannot stop us, because the American system is based on the united states.It\u2019s true in clean energy in my state, where those jobs are growing 17 times faster than the overall economy right now.And we need to demonstrate job creation in small and rural communities across the country.We need a national policy that will focus on those areas that have been de-industrialized. We are going to be able to show job creation across the state in urban and rural areas.The Democratic Party can and should be the party to offer those solutions. You can\u2019t go back and just say we are going to bring back the jobs that disappeared when the tech revolution occurred. You\u2019ve got to focus on the jobs of today and tomorrow. Policy matters.Mayor Rahm Emanuel of ChicagoDemocrats need to channel our anger, not be defined by it. We need to be clear about what we stand for, not just rail against what we oppose.Our message must make a connection with the challenges Americans are facing, including making debt-free college a reality, expanding access to affordable health care and creating good-paying jobs. Democrats must present a credible plan to address America\u2019s problems that meets voters where they are.The laws of political gravity already ensure that the 2018 election will be a referendum on President Trump and the Republicans in Congress. Thus far, that record has been abysmal, with one high-profile failure on top of another.As bad as the policies Republicans are pursuing would be for middle-class Americans, their inability to pass them and actually govern the country \u2014 despite unified control \u2014 only exacerbates their vulnerability and opens the door for Democrats.It is up to us, then, to walk through that door by doing what our most effective leaders have always done: articulating an aspirational, attainable agenda for the future while presenting a clear contrast with the other side.Attorney General Xavier Becerra of CaliforniaI don\u2019t think our message should be any different than it was when F.D.R. was president or J.F.K. was president. If you work hard and play by the rules, we\u2019ve got your back.I think F.D.R. made it very clear when he established Social Security: He went after the banks, he created the unemployment insurance system. L.B.J. created Medicare. J.F.K. created the Peace Corps. Democrats created the G.I. Bill of Rights. All of those things demonstrated if you just do it the right way, we will have your back.It\u2019s focused squarely on the folks in the middle, folks who aspire to be in the middle. It reminds me of how so much of what F.D.R., J.F.K. and L.B.J. did really focused on my parents, on how a construction worker and a clerical worker in my mom and dad\u2019s time could go on to buy a house and send four kids to college and live in retirement in dignity.But I think most people will tell you, they don\u2019t believe it, they don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve got your back as leaders. And that\u2019s where Democratic leaders need to come forward and say, no, we do have your back.I try to explain to folks the pain and the anxiety that a lot of formerly middle-class families in the Rust Belt states, for example, are feeling these days \u2014 and that explains why so many of them voted for Donald Trump for president. That\u2019s the same pain and anxiety my parents went through. They are Latino immigrants. They had that working-class sense of optimism that they will do better for their kids, and their kids will do better. In my case, there was no doubt.A lot of folks in the Rust Belt states are saying, \u2018Hey, we don\u2019t see our kids and grandkids exceeding our expectations \u2014 or their own expectations.\u2019\u201dAs a son of immigrants, I am an optimist because it runs in my DNA. But if you\u2019ve got two or three generations now, where before you used to have that union job at G.M., or even that coal mining job, you do start to get skeptical.Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode IslandThe economy is changing, and Americans are worried about keeping up and getting ahead. Not long ago, if you had a high school diploma, you could get a good job. Generations of families worked in factories building things.Today, it\u2019s nearly impossible to find a good job out of high school, and the cost of a college education is on the rise. People who don\u2019t have a college degree know it\u2019s harder than ever to get the skills needed to get good work. And a lot of people have decided we don\u2019t understand their struggles.Democrats are committed to making sure everyone who is willing to work hard has a fair shot at a good job. The economy is changing, yes. We can\u2019t turn back the clock. But we can make sure there\u2019s a place for everyone in the new economy.Not as many people will work in the type of factory my father worked in when I was a kid, but we have a real opportunity to expand advanced manufacturing in America.There\u2019s still a crucial role for people who have skills. Elected leaders must focus on getting our people trained for the new, advanced manufacturing jobs we\u2019re creating. These jobs require the same work ethic and determination that made America the most powerful economy in the world. This is our promise to Americans: We will create more jobs, and give everyone the training and education they need to get the good jobs we\u2019re creating. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in Rhode Island.Mayor Kasim Reed of AtlantaWe find ourselves on different ground today \u2014 but it\u2019s not entirely new ground. History shows there have been many times in our country when there was a struggle over who will have the influence to define the future.The Democratic Party needs to demonstrate, once again, that we\u2019re fighting for a future where we can be the best version of ourselves. We need to regain the energy, the unity and the confidence that have carried us in the past, because our passion never fails. The best version of America is worth the effort. A big, bold, inclusive vision for America is the key.As President John F. Kennedy once said, things don\u2019t just happen. They are made to happen. I believe the Democratic Party needs to say loudly and clearly that the future we will make is one where you can be who you are, love who you love and pursue your dreams \u2014 where you can have a fair shot and a fair shake \u2014 regardless of your place of birth, your parents\u2019 income, the color of your skin, your gender or your religion. We envision a future where every American can achieve their highest potential without limits.These ideals are under attack at this very moment, but there are some fights which must be fought \u2014 and the Democratic Party will be at the forefront.Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, IND.To me, we are making this way too complicated. The message to me is that we are the party that is out to support and protect ordinary people going about their lives.So I think as a party, we\u2019ve got to return the center of gravity to lived experience, and there are some indications that it is happening. If you look at the most important policy, which is holding off A.C.A. repeal, what really turned the tide there wasn\u2019t the cleverness of Democratic office holders, it was ordinary people telling their stories in town halls.The beauty of that was it was an antidote to alternative facts. You can\u2019t lie to somebody about the circumstances of their own life.We have the message: that we are sticking up for ordinary people as they go through their lives. The challenge is to convey that message in a way that gets through some of the false choices. Do we maintain our commitment to racial justice or do we appeal to the white working class? I think that\u2019s a terrible question. Who wouldn\u2019t want to do both?Democrats\u2019 policy goals should be to make sure that everybody continues to have access to health care by whatever it takes. Making sure that large institutions, especially banks and corporations, can\u2019t rip you off. We have a responsibility to make sure everybody has a shot and has a way to fit in.I talk about it a lot in terms of freedom because Democrats have to get back in the habit of talking about freedom.Your freedom very much depends on whether you can start a business and know you have access to health care, whether you can marry someone you love or sue a bank that is cheating you. That\u2019s our freedom agenda.In Washington, all the protagonists are political characters. It\u2019s gotten to be as if the only people who matter are politicians. It\u2019s all about the individual as characters. What\u2019s going on with Roy Moore? What\u2019s going on with Nancy Pelosi? What\u2019s going on with Steve Bannon? And there\u2019s all these people in places like Indiana who say: What about me? I\u2019ve never met Steve Bannon.And we\u2019ve allowed the conversation because it\u2019s mesmerizing, it\u2019s fascinating, it\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d but people need to see themselves as the main characters in the story we are telling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Unexamined Brutality of the Male Libido", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionAfter weeks of continuously unfolding abuse scandals, men have become, quite literally, unbelievable. What any given man might say about gender politics and how he treats women are separate and unrelated phenomena. Liberal or conservative, feminist or chauvinist, woke or benighted, young or old, found on Fox News or in The New Republic, a man\u2019s stated opinions have next to no relationship to behavior.Through sheer bulk, the string of revelations about men from Bill Cosby to Roger Ailes to Harvey Weinstein to Louis C.K. to Al Franken and, this week, to Charlie Rose and John Lasseter, have forced men to confront what they hate to think about most: the nature of men in general. This time the accusations aren\u2019t against some freak geography teacher, some frat running amok in a Southern college town. They\u2019re against men of all different varieties, in different industries, with different sensibilities, bound together, solely, by the grotesquerie of their sexuality.Men arrive at this moment of reckoning woefully unprepared. Most are shocked by the reality of women\u2019s lived experience. Almost all are uninterested or unwilling to grapple with the problem at the heart of all this: the often ugly and dangerous nature of the male libido.For most of history, we\u2019ve taken for granted the implicit brutality of male sexuality. In 1976, the radical feminist and pornography opponent Andrea Dworkin said that the only sex between a man and a woman that could be undertaken without violence was sex with a flaccid penis: \u201cI think that men will have to give up their precious erections,\u201d she wrote. In the third century A.D., it is widely believed, the great Catholic theologian Origen, working on roughly the same principle, castrated himself.Fear of the male libido has been the subject of myth and of fairy tale from the beginning of literature: What else were the stories of Little Red Riding Hood or Bluebeard\u2019s Castle about? A vampire is an ancient and powerful man with an insatiable hunger for young flesh. Werewolves are men who regularly lose control of their bestial nature. Get the point? There is a line, obviously, between desire and realization, and some cross it and some don\u2019t. But a line is there for every man. And until we collectively confront this reality, the post-Weinstein public discussion \u2014 where men and women go from here \u2014 will begin from a place of silence and dishonesty.The masculine libido and its accompanying forces and pathologies drive so much of culture and politics and the economy, while remaining more or less unexamined, both in intellectual circles and in private life. I live in Toronto, a liberal city in a liberal country, with Justin Trudeau for prime minister, a half-female cabinet and an explicitly feminist foreign policy.The men I know don\u2019t actively discuss changing sexual norms. We gossip and surmise: Who is a criminal and who isn\u2019t? Which of the creeps whom we know are out there will fall this week? Beyond the gossip, there is a fog of the past that is better not to penetrate. Aside from the sorts of clear criminal acts that have always been wrong, changing social norms and the imprecision of memory are dark hallways to navigate. Be careful when you go down them; you might not like what you find.So much easier to turn aside. Professionally, too, I have seen just how profoundly men don\u2019t want to talk about their own gendered nature. In the spring, I published a male take on the fluctuations of gender and power in advanced economies; I was interviewed over 70 times by reporters from all over the world, but only three of them were men. Men just aren\u2019t interested; they don\u2019t know where to start. I\u2019m working on a podcast on modern fatherhood, dealing with issues like pornography and sex after childbirth. Very often, when I interview men, it is the first time they have ever discussed intimate questions seriously with another man.A healthy sexual existence requires a continuing education, and men have the opposite. There is sex education for boys, but once you leave school the traditional demands on masculinity return: show no vulnerability, solve your own problems. Men deal with their nature alone, and apart. Ignorance and misprision are the norms.Acknowledging the brutality of male libido is not, of course, some kind of excuse. Sigmund Freud recognized the id, and knew it as \u201ca chaos, a caldron full of seething excitations.\u201d But the point of Freud was not that boys will be boys. Rather the opposite: The idea of the Oedipus complex contained an implicit case for the requirements of strenuous repression: If you let boys be boys, they will murder their fathers and sleep with their mothers.Freud also understood that repression, any repression, is inherently fluid and complicated and requires humility and self-searching to navigate. Women are calling for their pain to be recognized. Many men are quite willing to offer this recognition; it means they don\u2019t have to talk about who they are, which means they don\u2019t have to think about what they are. Much easier to retreat, into ever more shocked and prurient silence, or into the sort of reflection that seems less intended as honesty, and more aimed to please.Sex is an impediment to any idealism, which is why the post-Weinstein era will be an era of gender pessimism. What if there is no possible reconciliation between the bright clean ideals of gender equality and the mechanisms of human desire? Meanwhile, sexual morality, so long resisted by liberals, has returned with a vengeance, albeit under progressive terms. The sensation of righteousness, which social media doles out in ever-diminishing dopamine hits, drives the discussion, but also limits it. Unable to find justice, or even to imagine it, we are returning to shame as our primary social form of sexual control.The crisis we are approaching is fundamental: How can healthy sexuality ever occur in conditions in which men and women are not equal? How are we supposed to create an equal world when male mechanisms of desire are inherently brutal? We cannot answer these questions unless we face them.I\u2019m not asking for male consciousness-raising groups; let\u2019s start with a basic understanding that masculinity is a subject worth thinking about. That alone would be an immense step forward. If you want to be a civilized man, you have to consider what you are. Pretending to be something else, some fiction you would prefer to be, cannot help. It is not morality but culture \u2014 accepting our monstrosity, reckoning with it \u2014 that can save us. If anything can.Stephen Marche is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Unmade Bed: The Messy Truth About Men and Women in the 21st Century.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They have piled on subsidies, halfhearted jobs programs and forbidding public housing projects, then forgotten about them until eruptions of violence and discontent.Unemployment in many suburbs is more than twice the national average of just under 10 percent, and some suburbs are also breeding grounds for homegrown jihadists, a point Mr. Macron mentioned on Tuesday.This French president\u2019s approach appears to be somewhat different as it evolves in the face of criticism that Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, favors the rich.Among the critics, Martine Aubry, the Socialist mayor of Lille and the author of the 35-hour workweek when she was in the government in the 1990s, tore into Mr. Macron on Monday for reducing state support for a government-subsidized jobs program.On Tuesday in Tourcoing, Mr. Macron derided the program as ineffectual. His answer was long-term training for the chronically out-of-work and one-time cash incentives to employers offering jobs to suburban youths.\u201cAssisted job contracts, that\u2019s not the solution,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cYou wind up unqualified at the end. Those who are advocating them should try taking one. They don\u2019t even want them for themselves. There\u2019s no future in it.\u201dInstead, he promised some $17 billion for job training that \u201ctakes a year or two,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a policy of subsidies, it\u2019s a policy of investment in people.\u201dBut he also proposed cash incentives for companies hiring in depressed zones \u2014 $17,000 for a long-term hire and $6,000 for a short-term contract.He veered between the lofty and the down to earth, as he often does. On the one hand, he called for a \u201cgeneral mobilization\u201d on behalf of struggling France, and vowed to \u201crestore the Republic\u201d in poorer neighborhoods to fight Islamization.On the other, he offered frank recognition that the odds were often stacked against young people with immigrant backgrounds in the country\u2019s suburban areas.During his presidential campaign, Mr. Macron had called for a modest affirmative action program to integrate young immigrants \u2014 a radical notion in a country where the idea is generally scorned.Surveys have shown though that France is one of the rare countries where first-generation immigrants have had higher unemployment rates than the national average.On Tuesday, Mr. Macron called for a \u201cfight against discrimination in hiring,\u201d saying the \u201cmost efficient response is a toe-to-toe fight, penalize discrimination.\u201d\u201cNaming them is very efficient,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cStigmatize companies that act this way.\u201dIt remains to be seen whether Mr. Macron\u2019s excursions this week to \u201cleft-behind France,\u201d as it is often called, will be enough to quiet critics who deride him as favoring the rich.In three months, he has slashed France\u2019s wealth tax, cut the tax on capital gains and reformed the rigid labor code to give more leeway to individual companies negotiating work contracts with employees.All of it has earned him a sobriquet that visibly irritates Mr. Macron: President of the Rich. So far, though, the usual forum in which popular discontent plays out \u2014 the French street \u2014 has failed to react.This suggests, as an opposition leader ruefully acknowledged recently, that the new president has won the first round.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Six Myths About Choosing a College Major", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany colleges ask you to choose a major as early as your senior year of high school, on your admissions application. Yet there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll change your mind. The Education Department says that about 30 percent of students switch majors at least once.It\u2019s true that computer science and engineering top all the pay rankings, but salaries within specific majors vary greatly.But what if you never make it to the top of the pay scale? Even English or history graduates who make just above the median lifetime earnings for their major do pretty well when compared to typical graduates in business or a STEM field.Take the median lifetime earnings of business majors, the most popular undergraduate degree. The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you\u2019ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).\u201cWomen can\u2019t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,\u201d said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.Dr. Carnevale wouldn\u2019t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.Not so. In seven states \u2014 Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington \u2014 students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.\u201cStudents at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,\u201d Dr. Carnevale said.They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. \u201cIt increases your breadth of knowledge,\u201d he said.The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of \u201cYou Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a \u2018Useless\u2019 Liberal Arts Education.\u201d In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.\u201cOnce C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,\u201d Mr. Anders said, \u201cthey come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.\u201dWhy settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created \u201cmeta-majors,\u201d which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.\u201cWe have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,\u201d said Timothy Renick, Georgia State\u2019s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.\u201cStudents in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,\u201d Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana \u2014 enigmatology.\u201cMajors are artificial and restrictive,\u201d said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.\u201cMajors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don\u2019t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.\u201dMajors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today\u2019s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.\u201cI would argue against majoring in accounting,\u201d he said, \u201cor anything that a computer can be programmed to do.\u201dJeffrey J.

It\u2019s a sign that the world is still far from achieving its goals to limit global warming.Global emissions from fossil fuels and industry are on track to increase roughly 2 percent over last year\u2019s levels, driven in part by a rebound in coal use in China, the world\u2019s largest emitter. While dozens of nations, including the United States, have been reducing their emissions in recent years, those declines have so far been offset by rising pollution from developing countries.For much of the 21st century, global carbon dioxide emissions increased at a rate of more than 2 percent per year, as rapidly industrializing countries like China and India built hundreds of coal plants and put millions of new cars on the road. The link between economic development and emissions growth seemed inextricable.This year\u2019s rebound in emissions suggests that it\u2019s too soon to celebrate.Emissions increasingEmissions decreasing\u20132%0+2%+4%WorldChinaU.S.E.U.IndiaProjected emissions growth rate for 2017Uncertainty rangeEmissions increasingEmissions decreasing\u20132%0+2%+4%WorldChinaU.S.E.U.IndiaProjected emissionsgrowth rate for 2017Uncertainty rangeOn the flip side, the Global Carbon Project found, at least 21 countries have managed to cut their emissions significantly while growing their economies over the past decade, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Sweden. These countries have steadily transitioned away from energy-intensive industries \u2014 or have outsourced manufacturing to countries like China \u2014 while increasing investments in efficiency and cleaner energy.But there are signs that emissions reductions in these wealthier countries have decelerated of late. In the United States, fossil-fuel emissions are projected to fall by approximately 0.4 percent this year, compared to an average decline of 1.2 percent per year over the past decade.Similarly, the European Union\u2019s emissions are expected to fall just 0.2 percent this year, a smaller decrease than the 2.2 percent average annual decline of the previous decade.\u201cEvery year that goes by without an emissions peak,\u201d Mr. Peters said, makes the job of cutting greenhouse gases quickly enough to stabilize global warming this century \u201cthat much harder.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Sells Tax Plan With False Claims", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact CheckWASHINGTON \u2014 At a Wednesday afternoon rally in Missouri, President Trump played up what he called the \u201cbiggest tax cuts in history\u201d and boasted about economic growth \u201cin a nonbraggadocious way.\u201d\u201cIn fact, they\u2019re going to say Trump is the opposite of an exaggerator,\u201d he said of his rosy projections, in a speech full of exaggerations and falsehoods. Here\u2019s an assessment.President Ronald Reagan, who enacted a major tax cut in 1981 and lowered tax rates again in 1986, was hardly the last president to have done so. President Bill Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. President George W. Bush enacted two major tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. The stimulus passed under President Barack Obama included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, and Mr. Obama later extended the Bush tax cuts with the American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012.Mr. Trump insisted that the tax bill is \u201cnot good for me\u201d or the wealthy.

{"Headline": "White House Pressed Unsuccessfully to End Immigration Program", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House unsuccessfully tried to pressure the Homeland Security Department to end a program that allows hundreds of thousands of people from countries affected by natural disasters or violence to live in the United States without fear of being deported, according to people familiar with the discussions.John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, made an 11th-hour plea to Elaine Duke, the acting Homeland Security secretary, ahead of a deadline this past Monday to decide about the status of immigrants in the program from Honduras and Nicaragua.Accounts of her phone calls with Mr. Kelly laid bare the strains between Trump administration officials trying to reduce both legal and illegal immigration \u2014 a campaign promise of President Trump\u2019s \u2014 and career immigration officials who see those efforts as overly broad and harsh.The internal tensions over the administration\u2019s immigration agenda were on display in discrepancies among descriptions of the calls.A White House official said that Mr. Kelly had encouraged Ms. Duke to make a decision but did not pressure her to end the program.But two other people briefed on the exchange said Ms. Duke had informed the White House over the weekend of her decision to postpone ending the program for Hondurans. Soon afterward, the two people said, Mr. Kelly called Ms. Duke from Asia, where he was traveling with Mr. Trump, to tell her she had made the wrong decision and to reconsider.Mr. Kelly\u2019s message to Ms. Duke was that she needed to reverse course and end the program immediately, according to one of the people briefed on the call, who, like the others, asked for anonymity to describe a private discussion.Mr. Kelly raised none of the issues about conditions in Honduras, the person said. Mr. Kelly\u2019s focus was on a smooth confirmation process for Mr. Trump\u2019s pick to run the department, Kirstjen M. Nielsen, and avoiding any steps that would jeopardize the administration\u2019s immigration policies.A Homeland Security spokesman denied that account.\u201cIt is perfectly normal for members of the White House team to weigh in on major decisions,\u201d Tyler Q. Houlton, the spokesman, said on Thursday.And the White House official said that neither Ms. Nielsen\u2019s name nor the subject of her confirmation hearing came up during Mr. Kelly\u2019s call with Ms. Duke.The Trump administration will have to make similar decisions about Haitian immigrants later this month and El Salvadorans in March. The Nicaraguans who were protected under the program have until January 2019 to leave the United States.A memo written by the department\u2019s Office of International Affairs division suggested extending the temporary protective status for another 18 months, saying it made no sense to send citizens of Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador who were covered back to their countries of origin.The memo suggested that economies in those countries were still incapable of creating sufficient job opportunities for their young and growing populations and could not handle an influx of thousands of returning people.\u201cWe are still years away from a Central America in which people see their futures at home and not in the United States,\u201d the memo read, according to people who saw the document.Over all, the decision to end the program received pushback from other officials at the department, Homeland Security employees said.In response to questions about pressure to end the program, they said, White House officials and Mr. Kelly were making the argument to Ms. Duke that conditions had improved enough in Honduras to allow the protected immigrants to return home.Michael D.

(It Looks Beautiful in the Rain.)", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySkipton JournalSKIPTON, England \u2014 Britain\u2019s economy is slowing. Talks on quitting the European Union have stalled. And the government is in disarray, troubled by cabinet resignations and embroiled in a series of sex and sleaze accusations.Yet the national gloom seems to have bypassed Craven, an area of Yorkshire, in the north of England, that has startled Britons by emerging from national statistics as the happiest place in the country.In Craven\u2019s biggest town, Skipton, population around 15,000, even the local mayor, Andrew Rankine, admitted he was surprised. \u201cWe just go with the flow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are who we are.\u201dThat is because the north of England is considered by many southerners to be colder, poorer and less sophisticated than the south.Yet Yorkshire folk, it must be said, often revel in their reputation for being blunt and taciturn. One joke goes, \u201cYou can always tell a Yorkshireman \u2014 but you can\u2019t tell him much.\u201d Paul Routledge, a journalist and author who lives in Craven, sums up the Yorkshire ethos as: \u201cWhy call a spade a spade, when you can call it an effing shovel?\u201dOn a tour of the fortifications, which are among the best preserved in Britain, Mr. Fattorini pointed to what he calls the \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cmodern\u201d parts of the structure. They were added in the 16th century.Mr. Fattorini, who has an official title of Lord of the Honor of Skipton, has to think hard before he can say how many rooms there are in the castle\u2019s private area. He eventually counts 11. But he does know that only a couple are heated, and that to warm the rest, \u201cyou\u2019d need a nuclear power station.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say that living in Skipton was easy to start with for Mr. Fattorini, who moved from London in 1998.\u201cPeople are a lot straighter, more blunt,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not quite sure whether they are being friendly, then you realize they are being extremely friendly.\u201d Now he loves the place, noting that people have time for one another, and that \u201cif you died in your flat someone would notice.\u201dThe area has some gang activity, serious felonies and occasional cases of sheep rustling and poaching. But with about 20 crimes per 1,000 people per year, it is among the safest in England. Inspector Crocker said his force spent about 20 percent of its time on criminal behavior \u2014 less than it spent on traffic accidents.The local magistrates court, which handles less-serious offenses, is under threat because it hears too few cases. The police station has room to hold the few people who are arrested locally, but it\u2019s more cost-effective to drive them elsewhere.But most of those who live here (those who came from elsewhere are known as \u201coffcumdens\u201d) agree that the sense of community is what stands out.Danielle Daglan, venue and program manager at the town hall, moved to Skipton in 2002. She said it was the best decision she ever made.\u201cI feel that Yorkshire has allowed me \u2014 without being too cheesy \u2014 to become the person I wanted to be,\u201d she said, adding that the people \u201care genuinely friendlier than they are down south.\u201dNo one lives here for the weather, however. Mr. Rankine, the mayor, said a sunny day \u201chas been known to happen occasionally.\u201dFortunately, he added, \u201cSkipton is one of those places which is absolutely beautiful in the rain \u2014 as long as you are dressed appropriately.\u201dCraven is an affluent pocket of the north, though not the richest place in the country. To Mr. Myers, that illustrates that wealth and happiness are not synonymous.\u201cI think it\u2019s about being self-sufficient, valuing your communities, and doing your bit and mucking in together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t because we can afford fancy cars.\u201dThis being Yorkshire, not everyone is buying the notion of Craven as Shangri-La.\u201cIt\u2019s not as wonderful as those who make these claims for it say,\u201d said Mr. Routledge, sipping a pint of local beer, which, incidentally, is roughly half the price of a pint in London.\u201cThe traffic is appalling, there are not enough places to park and it\u2019s too expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bus services have been cut back, and it\u2019s a honey pot for commuters into Leeds and Bradford, so a lot of local people can\u2019t afford to live here.\u201dBut the inhabitants of Craven seem to be happy with the way they are even if, to some outsiders, that can appear glum.Dave Parker, chief officer for Skipton Town Council, said the mistake was to equate happiness with people \u201cdancing around the streets clapping their hands.\u201d\u201cYou will find the old bloke who has been a farmer for years, who is very, very, happy sitting at the side of his log fire, in his pub, having his pint \u2014 but he won\u2019t look as though he is the happiest person in the world,\u201d Mr. Parker said.After performing several numbers, including the \u201cRawhide\u201d theme, one band member asked the fatal question: \u201cWhat do you think of it so far?\u201d\u201cRubbish!\u201d came the shouted reply from the audience, to cheers and gales of laughter.No one left early.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Everything Is Bad. Blame the Tax Code.", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWASHINGTON \u2014 If there\u2019s one thing Americans of all political parties can agree on, it\u2019s that taxes stink. But if there\u2019s another thing they can agree on, it\u2019s that they hate those jerks who don\u2019t pay their fair share of taxes.All of this glorious dysfunction is made possible by the complexity of the tax code. The United States has one of the highest corporate tax rates among the world\u2019s major economies, and a relatively high effective individual tax rate. But where things get dicey is the enormous number of incentives, credits, thresholds and exceptions. Benefits go to corporations (what exactly is accelerated depreciation?), the rich (enjoying the low tax rate on those long-term capital gains?), the middle class (hello, mortgage interest rate deduction!) and the poor (nice to see you, earned-income tax credit). They favor the fertile (child tax credit) and the dead (trusts and estates). They go to the urban and suburban (state and local income tax deduction) and the rural (farm fuel tax credit).Taxes are the viscera of American politics, the bleeding guts of nearly every policy proposal. \u201cSimplifying the tax code\u201d has served as State of the Union boilerplate for presidents of both parties, yet somehow it doesn\u2019t get done even in times of unified government. That\u2019s because loopholes are the most underrated locus of political power. Politicians use the tax code to reward their friends, punish their enemies and cut deals with their colleagues. The complexity of the tax code gives them cover to do that without most Americans noticing what\u2019s going on. This creates a silent, extremely potent constituency for opacity, complexity and an ever-growing body of highly specific rules.When Congress opens loopholes, it\u2019s typically with the intention of shoving Americans right through them. The generous mortgage deduction is intended to increase homeownership. Bumping up the child tax credit is supposed to make more American babies. Cutting the capital gains tax shoves money into the stock market. Anytime you do something to minimize your tax bill, you\u2019re doing what a politician wanted.This is not entirely Donald Trump\u2019s fault (for once). The Republican Party\u2019s allergy to closing loopholes predates his presidency. Since 1986 \u2014 the last serious, successful effort to simplify the tax code \u2014 being a signatory to Grover Norquist\u2019s Taxpayer Protection Pledge has been the cost of admission into civilized Republican society. The pledge binds signatories to oppose all increases in marginal income tax rates for individuals and businesses. It also requires that they oppose the elimination of deductions and other loopholes unless increased revenue is offset by reductions elsewhere. What the pledge very carefully does not ask signatories to do is to cut spending.In other words, nearly all Republican members of Congress have signed a deal that makes it politically unappealing (though not impossible) to eliminate loopholes. It allows them to wear the badge of fiscal conservatism without cutting spending. At the end of all those decades of distortion: the new Republican tax plan, with its cuts in the corporate tax rate, an increase of the standard deduction, some fiddling with income tax rates in different brackets and absolutely nothing in the way of simplification, rationalization or believable revenue neutrality.There are quite a few Republicans who have made no secret of the fact that they\u2019re holding their noses and working with Mr. Trump in order to get tax reform. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, as sincere a fiscal reformer as one can hope to see in leadership, was described as saying last week that he and the House Ways and Means Committee were \u201cturning the dials\u201d on the plan. By strategically phasing out certain provisions and plugging in optimistic growth estimates, the Republicans might get the math to work on paper. But in reality, no one seemed to know where the offsetting hundreds of billions in revenue will come from, and for every door the plan closes, it opens a window.Everyone lies to the tax man, knowingly or unknowingly. That\u2019s why howling for the president\u2019s tax returns is an ever-present background noise in the nation\u2019s capital: Reporters know there are likely to be exaggerations, bold deductions and envelope-pushing maneuvers aplenty in there, because they\u2019ve done the same on their own returns.People hate taxes because they hate to be pushed around. But politicians love taxes because it\u2019s their job to push people around, and taxes are a powerful tool to do just that. A \u201ctax return you can fill out on the back of a postcard\u201d \u2014 long promised by the Republican Party \u2014 would essentially be a decision by the political class to unilaterally disarm itself. And that\u2019s not going to happen.Katherine Mangu-Ward is the editor in chief of Reason magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Myanmar Is Not a Simple Morality Tale", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAYPYIDAW, Myanmar \u2014 As world capitals go, this is one of the weirdest. Six-lane highways with scarcely a car on them could serve as runways. The roads connect concealed ministries and vast convention centers. A white heat glares over the emptiness. There is no hub, gathering place or public square \u2014 and that is the point.Military leaders in Myanmar wanted a capital secure in its remoteness, and they unveiled this city in 2005. Yangon, the bustling former capital, was treacherous; over the decades of suffocating rule by generals, protests would erupt. So it is in this undemocratic fortress, of all places, that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, long the world\u2019s champion of democracy, spends her days, contemplating a spectacular fall from grace: the dishonored icon in her ghostly labyrinth.Perhaps because she sees something else above all: that Myanmar is not a democracy. It\u2019s a quasi democracy at best, in delicate transition from military rule, a nation at war with itself and yet to be forged. If she cannot walk the fine line set by the army, all could be lost, her life\u2019s work for freedom squandered. This is no small thing. Not to recognize her dilemma \u2014 as the West has largely failed to do so since August \u2014 amounts to irresponsible grandstanding.The problem is with what the West wants her to be. Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general who delivered a report on the situation in Rakhine State, in western Myanmar, just as the violence erupted there, told me that people in the West were incensed about Aung San Suu Kyi because, \u201cWe created a saint and the saint has become a politician, and we don\u2019t like that.\u201dCertainly Aung San Suu Kyi has appeared unmoved. She has avoided condemning the military for what the United Nations has called a \u201chuman rights nightmare.\u201d She shuns the word \u201cRohingya,\u201d a term reviled by many in Myanmar\u2019s Buddhist majority as an invented identity. Her communications team has proved hapless, and opacity has become a hallmark of her administration as she has shunned interviews. At a rare appearance with Tillerson at the Foreign Ministry here, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why people say that I\u2019ve been silent.\u201d It\u2019s untrue, she insisted. \u201cI think what people mean is that what I say is not interesting enough. But what I say is not meant to be exciting, it\u2019s meant to be accurate. And it\u2019s aimed at creating more harmony.\u201d\u201cHarmony\u201d is a favorite expression of hers, as is \u201crule of law.\u201d Both lie at a fantastic distance from the reality in Myanmar. It is a fragmented country still confronting multiple ethnic insurgencies and \u201calways held together by force,\u201d as Derek Mitchell, a former American ambassador, told me. Since independence from British imperial rule in 1948, the army, known as the Tatmadaw, has ruled most of the time, with ruinous consequences.In many respects, the military continues to rule. When her National League for Democracy won the 2015 election, Aung San Suu Kyi did not become president. The world rejoiced \u2014 and glossed over this detail. The 2008 Constitution, crafted by the military, bars her from the presidency because she has children who are British citizens. So she labors under the contrived honorific of state counselor. The Ministries of Defense, Home Affairs and Border Affairs \u2014 all the guns \u2014 remain under military control, as do the National Defense and Security Council and 25 percent of all seats in Parliament.This was not a handover of power. It was a highly controlled, and easily reversible, cession of partial authority.Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s decisions must be seen in this context. She is playing a long game for real democratic change. \u201cShe is walking one step by one step in a very careful way, standing delicately between the military and the people,\u201d said U Chit Khaing, a prominent businessman in Yangon. Perhaps she is playing the game too cautiously, but there is nothing in her history to suggest she\u2019s anything but resolute.The problem is she\u2019s a novice in her current role. As a politician, not a saint, it must be said that Aung San Suu Kyi has proved inept. This is scarcely surprising. She lived most of her life abroad, was confined on her return, and has no prior experience of governing or administering.You don\u2019t endure a decade and a half of house arrest, opt not to see your dying husband in England and endure separation from your children without a steely patriotic conviction. This is her force, a magnetic field. It can also be blinding. \u201cMother Suu knows best,\u201d said David Scott Mathieson, an analyst based in Yangon. \u201cExcept that she\u2019s in denial of the dimensions of what happened.\u201dThe hard grind of politics is foreign to her. Empathy is not her thing. Take her to a refugee camp; she won\u2019t throw her arms around children. She sees herself as incarnating the inner spirit of her country, a straight-backed Buddhist woman with a mission to complete what her father, whom she lost when she was 2, set out to do: unify the nation. Yet the road to that end remains vague. Even Myanmar\u2019s ultimate identity \u2014 a Buddhist state dominated by her own ethnic Bamar majority or a genuinely federalist, multireligious union \u2014 remains unclear. Her voice is absent.Could she, short of the military red lines that surround her, have expressed her indignation at the immense suffering of Rohingya civilians, and condemned the arson and killing that sent hundreds of thousands of terrified human beings on their way? Perhaps. But that would demand that she believes this is the essence of the story. It\u2019s unclear that she does; she\u2019s suspicious of the Rohingya claims and what she sees as manipulation of the media. It would also demand that she deem the political risk tolerable in a country that overwhelmingly supports her in her stance. Certainly she did not order the slaughter. Nor did she have the constitutional powers to stop it.In Rakhine State, where all hell broke loose last August, the poverty is etched in drawn faces with staring eyes. The streets of its capital, Sittwe, a little over an hour\u2019s flight from Yangon, are dusty and depleted. Its beach is overrun with stray dogs and crows feeding on garbage. As the town goes, so goes all of Rakhine, now one of the poorest parts of Myanmar, itself a very poor country. The violence that ripped through the northern part of the state was a disaster foretold.There was an earlier eruption, in 2012, when intercommunal violence between Rakhine Buddhists and Muslims left close to 200 people dead and about 120,000 people marooned in camps. There they have rotted for five years. Government promises have yielded nothing. The camps are closed off. Former Rohingya districts in town have been emptied, a shocking exercise in ghettoization.I spoke by phone with Saed Mohamed, a 31-year-old teacher confined since 2012 in a camp. \u201cThe government has cheated us so many times,\u201d he told me. \u201cI have lost my trust in Aung San Suu Kyi. She is still lying. She never talks about our Rohingya suffering. She talks of peace and community, but her government has done nothing for reconciliation.\u201dRakhine, also called Arakan, was an independent kingdom before falling under Burmese control in the late 18th century. Long neglect from the central government, the fruit of mutual suspicion, has spawned a Rakhine Buddhist independence movement, whose military wing is the Arakan Army. \u201cWe are suffering from 70 years of oppression from the government,\u201d Htun Aung Kyaw, the general secretary of the Arakan National Party, whose objective is self-determination for the region, told me.The steady influx over a long period of Bengali Muslims, encouraged by the British Empire to provide cheap labor, exacerbated Rakhine Buddhist resentments. The Muslim community has grown to about one-third of Rakhine\u2019s population of more than 3.1 million and, over time, its self-identification as \u201cRohingya\u201d has become steadily more universal.Within Myanmar, this single word, \u201cRohingya,\u201d resembles a fuse to a bomb. It sets people off. I could find hardly anybody, outside the community itself, even prepared to use it; if they did they generally accompanied it with a racist slur. The general view is that there are no Rohingya. They are all \u201cBengalis.\u201dU Nyar Na, a Buddhist monk, seemed a picture of serenity, seated at the window of a Sittwe monastery beside magenta robes hanging on a line. But when our conversation turned to the Rohingya, he bristled.\u201cThe whole problem lies in that word; there are no Rohingya among the 135 ethnic groups in Myanmar,\u201d he told me, alluding to the indigenous peoples listed in connection with the country\u2019s 1982 citizenship law. \u201cThis is not an existing ethnic group \u2014 they just created it. So if they believe it, the belief is false.\u201dHe reached down for his smartphone, and found an internet image supposedly representing the secessionist plans of the \u201cBengali Muslims.\u201d It showed Rakhine, shaded green, under the words: \u201cSovereign State of Rahamaland, an independent state of Rohingya people.\u201d He looked at me as if to say, there, you see, empirical proof of their diabolical intent.Such fears run deep. Aung San Suu Kyi is inevitably sensitive to them. A combination of more than a century of British colonial subjugation, the looming presence of China to the east and India to the west, with their 2.7 billion people (Myanmar has 54 million), and its own unresolved internal ethnic conflicts have marked the national psyche with a deep angst over sovereignty. U Ko Ko Gyi, a politician long imprisoned by the military but now in full support of the army\u2019s actions in Rakhine, told me, \u201cOur in-bone conviction from our ancestors is to resist outside pressure and fight until the last breath to survive.\u201dMyanmar, with its bell-shaped golden pagodas dotting the landscape, shimmering in the liquid light, often seems gripped these days by a fevered view of itself as the last bastion of Buddhism, facing down the global advance of Islam in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and elsewhere. The Rohingya have come to personify these fears.Many conversations here reminded me of my time covering the Balkan wars of the 1990s when Serbs, in the grip of a nationalist paroxysm, often dismissed the enemy \u2014 Bosnian Muslims, Kosovo Albanians \u2014 as nonexistent peoples. But as Benedict Anderson observed, all nations are \u201cimagined communities.\u201d The Rohingya exist because they believe they exist.It does not matter when exactly the name was coined \u2014 dispute rages on this question \u2014 or when exactly the Muslims of Rakhine embraced it in their overwhelming majority. Nothing is more certain to forge ethno-national identity than oppression. By making Rakhine Muslims stateless \u2014 by granting them identity cards of various hues that at various times seemed to confer citizenship or its promise only to withdraw them \u2014 and by subjecting them to intermittent violence, the military of Myanmar and its Rakhine Buddhist militia sidekicks have done more than anyone to forge a distinct Rohingya identity.Out of such desperation emerged the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, or ARSA, the Rohingya insurgent group whose attacks on several police outposts close to the Bangladeshi border on Aug. 25 ignited a devastating military response. A persecuted people will take up arms. When you attempt to destroy a people you don\u2019t believe exists, fury may get the upper hand.In September, with hundreds of thousands of Rohingya already displaced in camps in Bangladesh, Aung San Suu Kyi told The Nikkei Asian Review she was puzzled as to why the exodus had continued after military operations slowed. She speculated: \u201cIt could be they were afraid there might be reprisals. It could be for other reasons. I am genuinely interested because if we want to remedy the situation, we\u2019ve got to find out why \u2014 why all the problems started in the first place.\u201dHer tone, weirdly academic, seemed almost plaintive. The problems started because of an abject failure over decades. Military governments failed Rakhine Buddists; they failed Rakhine Rohingya even more, their policy laced through with racism. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s own government has prolonged that failure. The arson, killing and rape followed. This should be clear.It\u2019s less clear what should be done now. More than half a million terrorized people find themselves homeless. Bangladesh and Myanmar announced an agreement last week to begin returning displaced people within two months, but details were murky. Repatriation is urgent, but contentious, and will be meaningless unless Myanmar lays out an unambiguous and consistent path to citizenship, or at least legal residency, for the Rohingya, who today constitute some 10 percent of all the world\u2019s stateless people. Denying the possibility of citizenship to people resident in Myanmar for a long time is unworthy of the democracy Aung San Suu Kyi wants to forge as her last legacy.This Burmese transition to democracy stands on a knife-edge. Its ultimate success is of critical importance, with forms of authoritarianism ascendant the world over. Criminal actions should be punished under the \u201crule of law\u201d Aung San Suu Kyi cites so often. But the sanctions being called for by more than 20 senators and by groups including Human Rights Watch, and even the targeted individual sanctions envisaged by the State Department, would undermine an already parlous economy, entrench the Burmese in their sense of being alone against the world and render any passage to full democracy even harder.The country is now in the sights of jihadist groups enraged by the treatment of the Rohingya. Already there is an ugly and significant movement of extremist Buddhist monks. Pope Francis, who plans to visit Myanmar this week, faces a delicate task in trying to advance conciliation. His first quandary will be whether to use the word \u201cRohingya,\u201d which the Annan report avoided, in line with the request of Aung San Suu Kyi. (She believes that both \u201cRohingya\u201d and \u201cBengali\u201d are needlessly provocative.) He should. The Rohingya exist, have suffered, and through suffering have arrived at an identity that is unshakable.Now in her 70s, Aung San Suu Kyi has to find her voice. Harmony is all very well, but meaningless without creative, energetic politicking. She knows she can\u2019t throw the military under the bus if she wants to complete what she began through her brave defiance of the army in 1988. The world should understand this, too. It might better focus on Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief who presided over a ludicrous military report on the atrocities that exonerated the army. Tillerson rightly demanded an independent inquiry. Taking down Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s portrait is easy for people in comfortable places who have never faced challenges resembling hers.In her book \u201cLetters from Burma,\u201d Aung San Suu Kyi wrote of the suffering of Burmese children: \u201cThey know that there will be no security for their families as long as freedom of thought and freedom of political action are not guaranteed by the law of the land.\u201dThe work of removing, once and for all, that anxiety from all the inhabitants of Myanmar and establishing the rule of law is far from done, as the devastating violence in Rakhine has amply illustrated. But Aung San Suu Kyi, a woman who faced down guns, remains the best hope of completing the task. Turning saints into ogres is easy. Completing an unfinished nation, clawing it from the military that has devastated it, is far more arduous \u2014 the longest of long games.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Victory May Rest Once Again With McCain, This Time on Taxes", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOnce again, it could all come down to Senator John McCain.After sinking his party\u2019s hopes of repealing the Affordable Care Act this year with a dramatic thumbs-down, the fate of a tax overhaul may now sit in the hands of the Republican from Arizona. In recent days, Mr. McCain has been fairly tight-lipped about his views on the tax proposal speeding through the Senate, saying he sees some problems with the existing bill but is waiting for a final plan before making a decision.Asked about what concerned him about the Senate tax bill this week, Mr. McCain replied tersely: \u201cA lot of things.\u201dEven those who know Mr. McCain best are unsure how he will vote, but if history is any guide, Republicans have reason to worry.Mr. McCain has voted against big tax cuts before, including two that passed under another Republican president: George W. Bush. In that case, he bucked the majority of his party on the grounds that the 2001 and 2003 cuts overwhelmingly benefited the rich \u2014 a widespread criticism of the current Senate legislation and the bill that has already passed the House. Mr. McCain is also a deficit hawk and could find it hard to swallow a tax cut that will add around $1.5 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years.With their slim majority in the Senate, Republicans can lose no more than two votes, and several others are on the fence.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Douglas Holtz-Eakin, policy adviser to Mr. McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, said when asked how his former boss would vote on the tax overhaul. \u201cFor most people there are going to be things in there they don\u2019t like and the question is what is preferable, the status quo or the bill.\u201dIn 2001, as Republicans forged ahead with a $1.35 trillion tax cut, Mr. McCain became one of two Republican senators to vote against the bill\u2019s passage. He said he could not accept that changes to the bill lowered the top individual tax rate to 35 percent and delayed tax relief for married couples.Two years later, Mr. McCain voted against another round of tax cuts. In his remarks in 2003, Mr. McCain again cast doubt on the need to use \u201cbillions of federal dollars to cut taxes for our nation\u2019s wealthiest.\u201d The deal breaker that time was that his fellow lawmakers would pass such cuts while rejecting legislation that would have allowed members of the military to get tax breaks on profits from selling their homes.\u201cPolitics ruled the day,\u201d he said ruefully.But Mr. McCain had been a tax cut skeptic well before those votes. After Republicans swept control of Congress in 1994, he was fretting about being fiscally responsible and urged his fellow lawmakers to heed the lessons of President Ronald Reagan.During his first run for president, Mr. McCain was the candidate of fiscal responsibility rather than tax relief. When debating George W. Bush during the 2000 Republican primary, it was clear that Mr. McCain did not think that the budget surplus should be spent on tax cuts.Senate leaders would need to win over several Republican senators to pass a tax overhaul.More recently, Mr. McCain has been toeing the party line on taxes.In 2006, Mr. McCain supported extending the Bush tax cuts on the basis that letting them expire would represent a tax increase.The current Senate version has some similar strands, though it goes much further in giving tax breaks to businesses. The Senate bill cuts the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent, phases out the alternative minimum tax for both individuals and businesses, and creates more favorable tax treatment for so-called pass-through businesses. On the individual side, it roughly doubles the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly to $24,000 from $12,700 and increases the value of some other tax breaks, such as the child tax credit.These days Mr. McCain seems far more concerned with the virtues of bipartisanship and \u201cregular order,\u201d insisting that both parties should have the chance to debate tax legislation and offer changes to any bill. His biggest priority remains robust military spending, and some have speculated that Mr. McCain could be wary that tax cuts would mean less revenue for the military and more debt for the nation.Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist and longtime adviser to Mr. McCain, said that if lawmakers mean what they have said over the years about fiscal restraint, they should oppose this tax bill.\u201cWe\u2019re about to find out the degree to which that viewpoint about fiscal discipline was political rhetoric or fundamental principle,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cIf it was political rhetoric, then this bill will pass. If those statements were principle based, then this bill will fail.\u201dThere have been some signals that Mr. McCain could be on board despite his public reluctance to embrace the bill. A spokeswoman for Mr. McCain pointed to his recent comments praising the process.Still, some supporters of the tax bill have been concerned that Mr. McCain, along with Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, could vote against the legislation, possibly to spite President Trump, whom they have all been critical of, and criticized by.Grover Norquist, the head of the anti-tax Americans for Tax Reform, said that he is hopeful that Mr. McCain will put his differences with Mr. Trump aside and get behind a tax bill that he thinks would be good for the party and the economy.\u201cYou want to be the guy who is bigger than any personal fight,\u201d said Mr. Norquist, who suggested that Mr. McCain voted against the 2001 tax cuts because he disliked Mr. Bush.As for Mr. McCain\u2019s penchant for going his own way, Mr. Norquist said he thought the senator had already proved himself.\u201cI think McCain did the maverick thing on health care, so if there are dues for the maverick club, he paid them this year big time,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Hits a Nerve, Eliciting Intense Reactions", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It usually doesn\u2019t take much to get people on the internet worked up. To get them really worked up, make the topic internet regulation.In some cases, views on the sweeping change, which would repeal landmark regulations meant to ensure an open internet, have turned into personal attacks. The agency\u2019s chairman, Ajit Pai, said threatening calls and emails had poured into his home and his wife\u2019s work. An image of a protest poster with his children\u2019s names was posted online and spread widely. Ethnic slurs aimed at Mr. Pai, whose parents immigrated from India, littered his Twitter feed.And at least 400,000 comments about the issue since April on the F.C.C. site appear to have originated from an apartment in St. Petersburg, Russia, the agency said. It is unclear whether the emails did originate from there, or were made to look as if they did.But none of that has overshadowed the heated reaction to the agency\u2019s proposal.\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be middle ground on this issue,\u201d said John Beahn, a lawyer at Skadden Arps who specializes in regulation.But Mr. Pai, a Republican nominated for the chairmanship by President Trump, said the regulations were heavy-handed and prevented telecom companies from pursuing new business models. His proposal, by stripping away the existing rules, would allow telecom companies to charge websites to deliver their data at higher speeds.\u201cI\u2019d like to cut through hysteria and hot air and speak in plain terms about the plan,\u201d Mr. Pai said, adding that the plan would bring back the regulation-free policy that helped the internet thrive. He said big tech companies might be a bigger threat to online speech than telecom companies.The proposal is expected to be approved at a meeting of the five F.C.C. commissioners on Dec. 14. The two other Republican commissioners have already expressed their support for Mr. Pai.Big web companies like Google and Netflix played activist roles as well, supporting the stronger rules. They argued that telecom companies should not be able to split sites into fast lanes and slow lanes, because that would allow them to become a sort of gatekeeper for information and entertainment. In addition, they say, it would hurt start-ups without the money to pay for the faster lanes.Mr. Pai, who opposed the rules as a commissioner in 2015, gave broad outlines of his plans early this year. For months, comments to the F.C.C. website piled up, to more than 20 million. President Barack Obama\u2019s clean power plan, perhaps his biggest policy change at the Environmental Protection Agency, attracted 4.3 million comments over six months.But the intensity has increased even more since Mr. Pai released the details of the proposal \u2014 perhaps in part because few people expected him to try to strip all of the existing rules.\u201cWhat the tech bloggers and the left don\u2019t like is that there are options and that there is a freedom in the marketplace and that people can choose superior service if they\u2019re willing to pay for it,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said. \u201cAnd if somebody\u2019s willing to pay for superior service, the providers had better provide it.\u201dPublic interest groups like Free Press and organizations like Mozilla, the nonprofit behind the popular Firefox browser, said they were prepared to file suit against the plan as soon as the vote on Dec. 14.\u201cThe action hit a nerve because the internet is central to the vast majority of people\u2019s daily lives, and so people were very eager to understand what was happening over the weekend,\u201d said Denelle Dixon, chief legal officer for Mozilla.The reaction from the biggest tech companies, however, has been noticeably subdued. Instead of forceful pleas from their executives, like those in years past on this issue, they are largely speaking through their trade group, the Internet Association, which has expressed disappointment over Mr. Pai\u2019s plan.\u201cInternet companies are firm supporters of the 2015 Open Internet Order and will continue our push for strong, enforceable net neutrality rules going forward,\u201d said Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association. \u201cWe are reviewing the draft order and weighing our legal options.\u201dTaking their place are start-ups such as Airbnb, Twitter and Reddit, which joined dozens of smaller start-ups on Monday warning Mr. Pai that the rules would hurt innovation and the economy.Sorting out the real individual commenters from fake or automated accounts is far more tricky. The F.C.C. said it did not have the resources to investigate every comment on its site.Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said that after a six-month investigation, his office had found that the identities of tens of thousands of state residents were fraudulently used to post comments to the F.C.C.\u201cIf law enforcement can\u2019t investigate and (where appropriate) prosecute when it happens on this scale,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said, \u201cthe door is open for it to happen again and again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The religious right will become, in effect, a conservative religious PAC that will be able to accept large donations from millionaires and large corporations to push its agenda, leaving secular political activists at a distinct disadvantage.MARK KERNES, LOS ANGELESYou rightly question whether any of the proposed tax cuts for corporations will, as Republicans claim, end up benefiting employees instead of shareholders and executives. While Democrats have been defensively voicing the same doubts, they should instead go on offense and call the Republicans\u2019 bluff by proposing a long overdue raise in the minimum wage.After all, Republicans have argued for years that corporations can\u2019t afford to pay higher wages and remain competitive, but since they are proposing to give corporations a huge tax break, that argument no longer holds water. Now is the time for Democrats to force this issue, and if Republicans balk at the idea of increasing the minimum wage, they will surely be recognized as the party that favors showering corporations with tax breaks while denying working people a decent wage.PETER HANAUER, BERKELEY, CALIF.The fortunes of billionaires are often based on unrealized capital gains on stock or real estate. Therefore, taxes have never been paid on these assets. The pending tax bill keeps the \u201cstep-up in basis\u201d at death, which wipes out the need for heirs to pay capital gains taxes on the appreciated value. The phasing out of the estate tax, along with a \u201cstep-up in basis,\u201d is a double gift for the children of the 1 percent.How is this a benefit for the middle class? Shame on Republicans for this giveaway.STUART L. STEIN, SANTA FE, N.M.The writer is a retired tax attorney.There are many problems with the tax bill currently being considered by Congress. However, a particularly onerous provision is often ignored: the proposal to eliminate the medical expense deduction. This deduction is crucial to middle-class families and cannot be used by the very rich since it is only for medical expenses in excess of 10 percent of income.However, it is crucial for families that incur significant medical expenses. The most obvious is nursing care for the elderly, the cost of which can exceed $100,000 a year. The poor can get Medicaid to pay such expenses. However, the middle class cannot. Medicare does not cover long-term care. Families should not have to bankrupt themselves to care for the elderly.Moreover, if people are forced to spend themselves into bankruptcy, they then become eligible for Medicaid, costing the government even more. Thus, removing this deduction, aside from being unfair, would not save as much as expected.The writer is a retired tax attorney.The Republican tax bill, favoring corporate polluters and the oil industry, would have detrimental effects on our environment. Tax incentives for electric vehicles are being targeted, with House Republicans proposing to scrap the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles.This cut will deter Americans from choosing a greener option when buying their next vehicle, causing air pollution to go up. The only profit in this situation is for oil and gas companies. A greener future is within reach, but not if a tax bill targeting electric vehicles passes.It\u2019s time to put the health and needs of Americans and our Earth ahead of corporate polluters.EVA ENDAHL, WASHINGTONThe writer is an environmental defense intern at Environment America.The question that needs to be asked is: At a time when the economy has been on a sustained recovery for eight years, and the unemployment rate is down to 4.1 percent, why do we need a tax cut at all? Basic economic theory would suggest that it would be more appropriate, under these economic conditions, to try to create a budget surplus and pay down the long-term deficit.JAY MALL, SAN FRANCISCOKatherine Mangu-Ward\u2019s trenchant piece on how Congress promotes its agenda through tax policy fails to touch on one action that could result in a significant increase in revenue without any politician\u2019s ox being gored: beefing up the I.R.S.\u2019s enforcement budget. One recent I.R.S. estimate is that for every additional dollar spent on enforcing compliance, four more dollars would be returned to the Treasury.Politicians on both sides of the aisle should be promoting an enhanced enforcement budget as a way of achieving the holy grail of revenue neutrality without offending any special interest group except, perhaps, tax scofflaws.CRAIG SHAW, TALLAHASSEE, FLA.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Coasts to Re-election, as Second-Term Challenges Await", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow comes the hard part.Gliding to his second landslide victory, Bill de Blasio was re-elected on Tuesday as the mayor of New York City, overwhelming his Republican challenger, Nicole Malliotakis, and a handful of independent candidates in what he declared a persuasive affirmation of his progressive agenda.\u201cIt\u2019s a good night for progressives,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at a victory party at the Brooklyn Museum, with his wife, Chirlane McCray, and his son, Dante, at his side. \u201cFor the first time in 32 years, a Democratic mayor was re-elected in New York City. But let\u2019s promise each other: This is the beginning of a new era of progressive Democratic leadership in New York City for years and years to come.\u201dYet Mr. de Blasio\u2019s ability to deliver on his agenda may have far more to do with the winds blowing out of Washington and Albany than with circumstances in the five boroughs.Federal budget cuts \u2014 threatened by President Trump and the Republican-led Congress, especially to social programs, health care and public housing \u2014 could cause serious problems and exacerbate social ills, forcing Mr. de Blasio to do financial triage. That could potentially drain money from signature programs, like his promise to accelerate and expand a push to build and preserve affordable housing.He has said that he would crusade in Albany to make the city\u2019s arcane property tax system fairer across neighborhoods. He said that he would appeal to Albany to improve the state\u2019s voting system to increase participation by making it easier to register to vote and to vote early.He wants money from Albany to make free schooling available to all 3-year-olds. And he wants the state to approve a tax on wealthy New Yorkers to pay for subway improvements.Mr. de Blasio is counting on his decisive victory to propel those changes. He received 66 percent of the vote, with more than 97 percent of electronic ballot scanners counted.Ms. Malliotakis, a state assemblywoman from Staten Island, received more than 27 percent of the vote.Also on Tuesday, Democratic incumbents breezed in the two other citywide races: Public Advocate Letitia James and Comptroller Scott M. Stringer both dispatched poorly financed Republican opponents.He withstood the sort of last-minute twists and events that could have made an incumbent vulnerable in a different, more closely fought campaign: a former donor testifying in a federal trial that he made contributions in exchange for access to City Hall; a deadly terrorist attack near the World Trade Center days before the vote.And he benefited from national politics, holding himself up as the city\u2019s bulwark against Mr. Trump, who was roundly rejected by New York City voters in 2016. Mr. de Blasio rarely skipped a chance to point out that Ms. Malliotakis voted for Mr. Trump last November.Mr. de Blasio called out Mr. Trump Tuesday night. He cheered Democratic victories for governor in key races in Virginia and New Jersey, and added, \u201cTonight, New York City sent a message to the White House as well.\u201dHe also sounded a note of urgency: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to become a fairer city and we\u2019ve got to do it soon, we\u2019ve got to do it fast,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw some important changes in the last four years, but you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201dSal Albanese, who lost to Mr. de Blasio in the Democratic primary and ran in the general election on the Reform Party line, received about 2 percent of votes.Bo Dietl, a retired police detective who ran as an independent on his own \u201cDump the Mayor\u201d line, received only about 1 percent, despite having appeared in two televised debates with Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Malliotakis and spending more than $1 million. He received fewer votes than the Green Party candidate, Akeem Browder, and was slightly trailing Michael Tolkin, the independent candidate.9 PhotosMr. de Blasio dismissed the testimony as the lies of a felon \u2014 Mr. Rechnitz pleaded guilty to a conspiracy count relating to bribery and influence buying \u2014 and he seemed to skate past it.Still, the testimony reminded voters of the state and federal investigations into the mayor\u2019s campaign finance practices that hobbled his administration throughout 2016 and into the first part of this year.In the end, the campaign could not escape the paradox of the mayor\u2019s personality: The \u201ctale of two cities\u201d of his campaign four years earlier had become a tale of two ways of seeing the mayor \u2014 a man who had made good on many of his promises and yet elicited little enthusiasm.The race was violently punctuated a week before the election when a man drove a rented pickup truck down the Hudson River Park bike lane, killing eight people and injuring a dozen, in what Mr. de Blasio quickly characterized as an act of terrorism. The carnage echoed the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, which occurred on the day of the mayoral primary that year, and helped create the conditions for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, to be elected mayor.But Mr. de Blasio\u2019s reassuring response to the tragedy provided no opening for his rivals to criticize his leadership under crisis.Ms. Malliotakis, 36, was not well known when she announced in April that she would seek the Republican nomination. Even after months of running, in what was her first citywide race, polls showed that most voters in the city \u2014 where Democrats outnumber Republicans among registered voters by more than six to one \u2014 did not know enough about her to form an opinion. She struggled to get voters\u2019 attention and to articulate a strong positive case for her candidacy, aside from criticism of Mr. de Blasio.\u201cI entered this race with eyes wide open, knowing that the odds were stacked against me,\u201d Ms. Malliotakis said after the race had been declared. \u201cWe may not have won this race, but we have made our voices heard.\u201dIn 2013, Mr. de Blasio received 795,679 votes, 72 percent of the ballots cast. On Tuesday night it appeared likely that he might not reach the same vote threshold. With 97 percent of scanners counted, Mr. de Blasio had about 706,000 votes.Shane Goldmacher, Luis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurn\u00ed and Jeffery C. Mays contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Some conservatives contend that the Fed should focus solely on inflation and not worry about unemployment.Mr. Powell also reiterated his support for the Fed\u2019s efforts to increase the strength of financial regulation in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, creating some distance from the Trump administration, which has described those regulations as an ineffective impediment to growth.\u201cOur financial system is without doubt far stronger and more resilient than it was a decade ago,\u201d he said. \u201cOur banks have much higher levels of capital and liquid assets, are more aware of the risks they run, and are better able to manage those risks.\u201dMr. Powell added, however, that he was open to changes that improved the current system.\u201cWe will continue to consider appropriate ways to ease regulatory burdens while preserving core reforms \u2014 strong levels of capital and liquidity, stress testing, and resolution planning \u2014 so that banks can provide the credit to families and businesses necessary to sustain a prosperous economy,\u201d he said.Mr. Powell, 64, joined the Fed in 2012. He is a lawyer by training and an investment banker by trade, with deep roots in the financial industry and the Republican Party. Since joining the Fed, he has voted consistently in support of the policies proposed by the current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke. But Mr. Powell has sometimes expressed reservations about the extent of the Fed\u2019s efforts to revive economic growth and to restrain the financial industry, suggesting he would seek to moderate the central bank\u2019s current approach.In his testimony, Mr. Powell praised both Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke and added that he would resist political pressure.\u201cI am committed to making decisions objectively and based on the best available evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cIn doing so, I would be guided solely by our mandate from the Congress and the long-run interests of the American public.\u201dAdvertisement"}

China\u2019s push to become a major player in electric cars is already shaking up the global auto industry. California\u2019s governor is hoping it will also give the state an advantage in its continuing showdown with Detroit over battery-powered vehicles.Gov. Jerry Brown said on Wednesday evening at an event in San Francisco that China\u2019s electric-car effort would help California withstand demands from American automakers that the state ease back on its effort to put more clean-burning vehicles on the road. California mandates that manufacturers sell a small but growing percentage of electric cars or plug-in hybrid vehicles, which run on both gasoline and electricity.Detroit says the mandate is technologically infeasible.\u201cEven now, some of the automobile companies are trying to come out and say \u2018Gee, the standards in a few years will be too tough,\u2019\u201d Governor Brown said. \u201c\u2018Will you let us off the hook?\u2019\u201dBut speaking at the The New York Times\u2019s Climate Tech conference, Governor Brown said China\u2019s push puts pressure on Detroit\u2019s automakers to more quickly embrace electric cars or be overwhelmed by the competition.\u201cWe have an ace card called China\u201d in the dispute, he said.California is the largest market for electric cars in the United States, and the world\u2019s second-largest after China.The Trump administration has begun moving to weaken overall fuel-economy standards in the United States. Still, Governor Brown said, California and China together are such an important part of global car sales that they represent \u201ctwo formidable domains that even Mr. Trump can\u2019t overcome.\u201dThe Chinese government said in September that it would phase out the sale of cars with internal combustion engines, a goal that Britain, France, India and Norway have already announced. Li Junfeng, a key architect of China\u2019s energy policies and senior adviser, said on the conference sidelines that China had not yet picked a year for the phaseout to be completed.Still, he added, \u201cI think China will be earlier than other countries.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)There is good news and bad news for California homeowners, says Ken Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business.Home prices, he predicts as part of his annual forecast, are not due for a crash.One wild card is the Republican tax plan.Professor Rosen calculates that if state and local income tax deductions are eliminated California taxpayers could be paying $38 billion more, a 2 percent to 3 percent reduction in the state\u2019s economy.\u201cOne-third of people in California are going to face a tax increase that\u2019s going to be quite substantial,\u201d Professor Rosen said.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "The Parasites Feeding on North Koreans", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEarlier this month at the National Assembly in Seoul, President Trump highlighted the tragic tale of the \u201ctwo Koreas\u201d \u2014 one free, just and peaceful, the other tyrannical, oppressive and dangerous. This contrast is at the root of America\u2019s most urgent national security challenge. It is also now on vivid display in a South Korean hospital, where doctors are working to save a wounded and malnourished North Korean soldier who defected last week from Kim Jong-un\u2019s slave state.The defector, whose full name is still not publicly known, risked his life by speeding across the Demilitarized Zone in a jeep, then dashing across the heavily guarded border at Panmunjon. He knew that North Korean troops have shoot-to-kill orders against anyone trying to flee. By the time he made it across, some six bullets had pierced his arms and torso.South Korean guards rescued him 55 yards south of the border, and doctors soon discovered just how grave his condition was: Along with the bullet wounds, he also had hepatitis B, pneumonia and \u201can enormous number\u201d of parasitic worms in his intestines, some up to 11 inches long. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my 20 years as a physician,\u201d said his South Korean surgeon. The worms can burrow into fresh wounds, with potentially devastating effects.This defector\u2019s plight is a window onto North Korean life. For all the regime\u2019s spending on sophisticated weapons, monuments to the Kim family and bribes for elites in Pyongyang, even trusted soldiers suffer terrible malnourishment. A vast majority of other North Koreans endure still worse. Such is the cruelty of North Korea\u2019s regime \u2014 and such is the responsibility of those foreign governments that enable it.Every one of North Korea\u2019s 23 million people is subject to the brutal state-imposed caste system known as songbun. The word \u201csongbun\u201d should be notorious around the world. From birth, every North Korean is marked by the government as a member of a loyal \u201ccore\u201d caste, a \u201cwavering\u201d middle caste or a \u201chostile\u201d caste, and this designation determines access to food, housing, education, jobs \u2014 everything. During the famine of the 1990s, when more than two million North Koreans perished, the songbun system often determined who ate and who starved.North Korea once had relatively productive heavy industry, in addition to minerals and other natural resources. But while South Korea boomed after the Korean War and became one of the world\u2019s great economies, the Communist North immiserated its people. Malnutrition makes children in North Korea significantly shorter and thinner than children in South Korea.Some 30,000 North Koreans have defected, mostly in the past two decades, and mostly by traveling a highly dangerous route through China and eventually to South Korea. Part of the danger comes from the North Korean border guards who shoot to kill. Part of the danger comes from vicious human traffickers who lure defectors into forced labor or prostitution. And part of the danger comes from Chinese authorities who send defectors back to North Korea, where they face imprisonment and execution. Such repatriations violate China\u2019s clear legal obligations under the International Refugee Convention.North Korea also goes after those defectors who manage to make it to freedom. The Trump administration this week designated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, partly because of assassinations of North Korean defectors and dissidents abroad, including Kim Jong-un\u2019s half brother, killed recently with VX nerve agent in Malaysia. The United States will not sit idly by as a rogue regime lawlessly pursues those who have made the life-or-death choice to run to freedom.Kim Jong-un also sends North Koreans overseas to earn money for his regime through slave labor at mines, logging camps, construction sites and the like, especially in China. Russia also uses North Korean forced laborers, some of whom are believed to have worked on soccer stadiums for the 2018 World Cup. United Nations officials estimated that Pyongyang earns some $230 million a year this way. The Trump administration has called on China, Russia and all other countries exploiting North Korean forced labor to cease immediately.It is important to detail North Korea\u2019s human rights horrors because they lend insight into the nuclear menace we face, and into those other countries still willing to trade with and cover for the Pyongyang regime. The North is as threatening to peace in Asia as it is cruel to its own people. It is past time for all civilized nations \u2014 and certainly for all nations seeking greater respect on the international stage \u2014 to work together fully for North Korean denuclearization, belatedly but finally.As for last week\u2019s defector, when he woke up from surgery this week, he is reported to have asked to listen to South Korean songs and watch American movies \u2014 a small taste of freedom long denied. As Americans take time this week to be thankful, may we all regard our freedom as so precious.Brian H. Hook is the director of policy planning and senior policy adviser at the State Department.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Subway Ridership Falls as M.T.A. Scrambles to Improve Service", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHave some New York City subway riders had enough?The increase in ridership was so dramatic that officials often blamed overcrowding for contributing to the rising number of delays in a century-old system that is ill equipped to deal with the demand.But recently, those ridership numbers have been heading in the other direction: down.Despite an increase in the population and in the number of new jobs, average weekday subway ridership dropped to 5.712 million this September from 5.817 million in September 2016, according to figures released this week by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\u201cHistorically, ridership numbers rise and fall with employment: when more people are working, more people ride public transit,\u201d said John Raskin, the executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group. \u201cA drop in ridership during a booming economy is an indicator of a transit system in crisis. People need to get to work and they are finding that public transit isn\u2019t getting them there. As a result, New Yorkers are voting with their MetroCards: they are starting to abandon an unreliable transit system and look for steadier, more comfortable alternatives.\u201dStill, other factors may have contributed to the decline, including changing work habits and transportation alternatives like ride-hailing apps and CitiBike, the shared biking service.Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, told reporters on Wednesday, that ridership had not declined during the morning and afternoon rush, leading him to believe that the drop was more related to lifestyle, rather than poor service.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t working for the man anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are working for themselves.\u201dJon Weinstein, a spokesman for the authority, said that an emergency repair plan that was started earlier this year was meant to improve subway service.\u201cAt roughly 5.7 million rides a day, New York City subway ridership is still near historic highs \u2014 and we are stabilizing the system through Subway Action Plan so riders have the reliability they deserve,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said.Above ground, the decline in ridership has been even steeper. The number of people riding the bus this September fell to 1.946 million from 2.087 in September of last year.Transit officials said that decline was driven in part by a generational shift, with younger New Yorkers less likely to ride the bus. But increased traffic on the city\u2019s streets was also to blame, often slowing bus service to a crawl.Average vehicle speeds in Manhattan below 60th Street have declined 12 percent from 2010 to 2015, according to the city\u2019s Department of Transportation.Robert E. Foran, the authority\u2019s chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that if the city did not kick in its share, \u201cthe plan will be scaled back.\u201dThe decline in ridership will only add to the transportation authority\u2019s financial burden.At the authority\u2019s board meeting on Wednesday, the agency said that declines in bus and subway ridership, along with lower toll fare collections than forecast, will result in a $281 million shortfall in its budget projections for 2018 to 2021.\u201cThese numbers show there is a clear need to implement some form of congestion pricing to help make buses faster and for a radical overhaul of the subway system to bring it into the 21st century,\u201d said Dani Simons, a spokeswoman for the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy organization. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019ll see riders shifting to other modes that provide the speed, reliability and modern experience they are looking for.\u201dEven if the authority is able to reduce costs and find a new source of funding, officials said that they might still need to increase fares and tolls.Mr. Lhota said that nothing had been decided on fares.\u201cRight now, we are still looking at a less than the rate of inflation increase in 2019,\u201d he said, referring to fares. \u201cIf the revenues come in sooner rather than later and we don\u2019t need the increase, that is a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers Lured to Australia Find Low Pay and Tough Conditions", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIDCOMBE, Australia \u2014 Like many young South Koreans, Gabi Cho moved to Australia for the chance to learn English, breathe its famously clean air and make some money.Two years ago, she found a job cutting hair in the Lidcombe area of Sydney. It paid about $9 an hour. To get the job, she put down about $380, refundable if she was never late or absent from work.At the time, she said, she did not know all of that was illegal.Ms. Cho, who now contends that the salon underpaid her by up to $30,000, is one of thousands of temporary foreign workers in Australia who are chronically underpaid by their employers, according to a survey released on Tuesday. It adds to growing evidence that Australia is home to a large but silent underclass of migrant workers, many of them international students or simply adventurous backpackers, who are rarely heard from despite widespread labor abuses.\u201cThe owner exploited my lack of English, lack of knowledge of the law and work rights,\u201d Ms. Cho said through a translator. \u201cI want people to know what happened to me so it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else.\u201dThe survey comes amid a rising awareness of labor abuses among temporary workers in Australia. With its developed economy, healthy environment and tight job markets in many places, Australia looks appealing to those looking for a foothold to live there and to those who simply want to make some money while visiting.The survey released Tuesday, called Wage Theft in Australia, covers an estimated 900,000 migrants with the right to work here. It found that roughly a quarter of international students made less than 12 Australian dollars, or $9, per hour, and almost half made 15 Australian dollars or less.In Australia, the national minimum wage is 18.29 Australian dollars, or $13.84, per hour. Casual employees, who are not entitled to vacation or sick leave, typically make more.The worst paid jobs were in fruit and vegetable picking and farm work, according to the survey.Many of the workers knew they were being underpaid, the survey found. Because of their visa status, the authors said, they probably did not expect to receive the legal minimum wage.The authors, who worked with local migrant and worker groups, acknowledged flaws in the survey, which included about 4,300 workers and was translated into 12 languages other than English. It was conducted online, which could exclude some groups, and because it was anonymous it could be completed more than once. Participants were invited to apply for a drawing for a total of about $1,000 in Amazon gift cards.Still, its conclusions roughly match those of some Australian government officials. Young people and people from migrant backgrounds may be more susceptible to exploitation in the workplace, said Mark Lee, a spokesman from the Fair Work Ombudsman, an independent government agency that investigates workplace complaints and enforces labor law.He added that this was because of a variety of factors, including \u201clanguage barriers, lack of understanding of their workplace rights, limited knowledge of where to go for help and concerns over their visa status.\u201d\u201cThis is a big issue in Korea,\u201d said Ms. Cho\u2019s husband, Andy Rim, a South Korean national who works as a warehouse supervisor. \u201cThey\u2019re sending people overseas to work as slaves.\u201dMr. Rim said he and his wife came to Australia through an employment program supported by the South Korean government.Workers from Asian countries appeared particularly susceptible to tough labor conditions, the study suggested. Workers from Asian countries including China, Taiwan and Vietnam received lower wage rates than those from North America, Ireland and Britain, the survey found.Working in construction in the central business district in the city of Brisbane, Mr. Song said he was paid 15 Australian dollars per hour. More than a third of workers at his site are Chinese or Taiwanese and on working holiday or tourist visas.\u201cThe salary difference doesn\u2019t seem fair,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it makes sense, and I don\u2019t feel I have a choice.\u201dXiuzhong Xu contributed reporting from Melbourne, Australia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Washington Drama: Treasury Secretary Versus Treasury Secretary", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It is an unwritten rule that if a former Treasury secretary has nothing nice to say about one of his successors he does not say anything at all. But in the nation\u2019s capital these days, the rules of political comity are meant to be broken.Raising eyebrows in economic circles, Lawrence H. Summers, the mercurial Treasury secretary for President Bill Clinton, has leveled a barrage of increasingly personal criticism at the current Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin.In podcasts, blog posts, op-eds and on Twitter, Mr. Summers, the former president of Harvard and a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, has accused Mr. Mnuchin of damaging the credibility of Treasury by making \u201cirresponsible\u201d economic assessments of the administration\u2019s tax plan and acting as a \u201csycophant\u201d to President Trump.The attacks have alternately amused and angered those who run in economic circles, with some saying it is Mr. Summers who is damaging the credibility of the office by leveling public attacks on a sitting Treasury secretary.\u201cFor me we have a tradition for people who have been in the position not to criticize current secretaries,\u201d said Paul H. O\u2019Neill, who served as President George W. Bush\u2019s first Treasury secretary. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have an opinion, but we don\u2019t tell people what we think.\u201dBut, he added: \u201cLarry is his own guy.\u201dWhile Treasury secretaries have all had varying degrees of success and influence, those who have held the job generally agree that heckles from predecessors are not helpful.\u201cFrom what I can remember, no one really talked badly about others,\u201d Franklin Noll, president of the Treasury Historical Association, said of former Treasury secretaries. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pop into my head because it didn\u2019t happen.\u201dSome have been taken aback by the personal nature of Mr. Summers\u2019 criticism of Mr. Mnuchin.\u201cI think criticism is best when it\u2019s specific \u2014 if there\u2019s a particular statement or policy that you disagree with, say why,\u201d said Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School and a former deputy assistant Treasury secretary. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need to be ad hominem.\u201dLarry Kudlow, an economist who calls himself a friend of Mr. Mnuchin and who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, said that he finds the tenor of the barbs thrown by Mr. Summers to be unwarranted.\u201cIt\u2019s unseemly for him,\u201d said Mr. Kudlow, who considers himself an admirer of Mr. Summers\u2019 work. \u201cHe\u2019s like name calling, he\u2019s making it personal, it\u2019s very vitriolic.\u201dCollegiality is the norm among Treasury secretaries, who have a tradition of meeting in Washington with new secretaries to welcome them into the fold and offer advice. This year, Mr. Mnuchin was feted at the Metropolitan Club at a dinner arranged by Henry Paulson, who served as Treasury secretary during Mr. Bush\u2019s second term. Mr. Summers attended, along with other former secretaries including Timothy F. Geithner, Robert Rubin and Mr. O\u2019Neill. Mr. Summers advised Mr. Mnuchin to protect the credibility of the office, according to a person who attended and another person familiar with the conversation.Mr. Summers, who declined to comment for this article, has defended his outspokenness about Mr. Mnuchin as an effort to protect the credibility and trustworthiness of the nation\u2019s top economic post.On Wednesday, Mr. Summers was back at it, criticizing Mr. Mnuchin in a Politico podcast for suggesting that the tax plan currently being debated by Congress would not add to the federal deficit.He added: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of so irresponsible an estimate coming from a Treasury secretary in the last 50 years.\u201dFor Mr. Summers, that criticism of Mr. Mnuchin was relatively measured compared to his previous salvos.In August, Mr. Summers again laced into Mr. Mnuchin over the one-page tax plan unveiled by Treasury in the spring. He said that such a skimpy outline must be demoralizing to the staff at Treasury and that the secretary\u2019s claims that slashing the corporate and individual income tax rates would not benefit the rich was eroding the credibility of the department.The Treasury Department had no comment about Mr. Summers\u2019 treatment of Mr. Mnuchin.For Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s part, he has tried to avoid the fray. Asked at a CNBC investor conference this fall about Mr. Summers\u2019 suggestion that the Trump administration\u2019s tax plan was a \u201cludicrous supply side fantasy,\u201d the secretary demurred.\u201cWell, I would never say anything bad about another Treasury secretary,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said before adding, \u201calthough there\u2019s lots and lots of economists that will line up on the other side of that argument.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A London Meeting of an Unlikely Group: How a Trump Adviser Came to Learn of Clinton \u2018Dirt\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 At midday on March 24, 2016, an improbable group gathered in a London cafe to discuss setting up a meeting between Donald J. Trump, then a candidate, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.There was George Papadopoulos, a 28-year-old from Chicago with an inflated r\u00e9sum\u00e9 who just days earlier had been publicly named as a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. There was Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese academic in his mid-50s with a faltering career who boasted of having high-level contacts in the Russian government.And, perhaps most mysteriously, there was Olga Polonskaya, a 30-year-old Russian from St. Petersburg and the former manager of a wine distribution company. Mr. Mifsud introduced her to Mr. Papadopoulos as Mr. Putin\u2019s niece, according to court papers. Mr. Putin has no niece.The interactions between the three players and a fourth man with contacts inside Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry have become a central part of the inquiry by the special prosecutor, Robert S. Mueller III, into the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to interfere with the presidential election. Recently released court documents suggest that the F.B.I. suspected that some of the people who showed interest in Mr. Papadopoulos were participants in a Russian intelligence operation.The revelations about Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s activities are part of a series of disclosures in the past two weeks about communications between Trump campaign advisers and Russian officials or self-described intermediaries for the Russian government. Taken together, they show not only that the contacts were more extensive than previously known, but also that senior campaign officials were aware of them.But records and interviews show that in spring 2016, Mr. Papadopoulos was welcomed into the thinly-staffed campaign as a \u201csurrogate\u201d who could articulate the candidate\u2019s views. He even helped edit a major foreign policy speech that Mr. Trump gave in Washington in late April, records indicate.The day before he learned about the hacked emails, Mr. Papadopoulos emailed Mr. Miller, then a senior policy adviser to the campaign, saying Mr. Trump had an \u201copen invitation\u201d from Mr. Putin to visit Russia. The day after, he wrote Mr. Miller that he had \u201csome interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right.\u201dThose emails were described in court papers unsealed Oct. 30 disclosing that Mr. Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts to the F.B.I. But the documents did not identify Mr. Miller by name, citing only a \u201csenior policy adviser.\u201d Neither he nor his lawyer responded on Friday to requests for comment.During interviews with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators, former campaign officials now working at the White House have denied having advance knowledge of the stolen emails, according to an official familiar with those discussions. Mr. Miller was among those recently interviewed.Mr. Mifsud\u2019s interest in Mr. Papadopoulos began only after Mr. Papadopoulos had joined the Trump campaign, according to documents released by Mr. Mueller. Mr. Papadopoulos was living in London at the time, hoping to land a full-time job with the campaign, and possibly in a future Trump administration.\u201cI remember him as a snake-oil salesman,\u201d recalled Manuel Delia, a former Maltese government official who first encountered him in the late 1990s when Mr. Mifsud was administering a scholarship program. Later, Mr. Mifsud styled himself as an expert in international relations, landing a job in 2012 as director of the London Academy of Diplomacy, a for-profit continuing education program. By early 2016, that academy had shut down.He did not exhibit any special interest or expertise in Russia until 2014, when his academy was beginning to stumble financially. It was at that time a 24-year-old Russian intern, Natalia Kutepova-Jamrom, turned up in his office with an improbably impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9.Fluent in Russian, English, German and Chinese, Ms. Kutepova-Jamrom had worked in the Russian government as a legislative aide and would move on to a Russian state newspaper. Both Mr. Mifsud\u2019s lawyer and Ms. Kutepova-Jamrom declined to comment. Mr. Mifsud did not respond to messages.Ms. Kutepova-Jamrom introduced Mr. Mifsud to senior Russian officials, diplomats and scholars. Despite Mr. Mifsud\u2019s lack of qualifications, she managed to arrange an invitation for him to join the prestigious Valdai Discussion Club, an elite gathering of Western and Russian academics that meets each year with Mr. Putin.Mr. Mifsud\u2019s inclusion in the group was \u201cvery, very strange,\u201d said James Sherr, the former head of the Russian studies program at Chatham House in London and a member of Valdai for nearly a decade. It \u201cmight suggest he does have connections,\u201d Mr. Sherr said.Mr. Mifsud suddenly became a popular pundit with state-run news outlets in Russia, praising the country and Mr. Putin. At his first Valdai conference in 2014, he argued against Western sanctions that punished Russia for its annexation of Crimea that year.\u201cGlobal security and economy needs partners, and who is better in this than the Russian Federation,\u201d he said.Among Mr. Mifsud\u2019s most important new contacts was Ivan Timofeev, a graduate of the elite Moscow State Institute of International Relations and a program director for the Valdai conference. Mr. Mifsud would eventually introduce Mr. Timofeev to Mr. Papadopoulos by email in April 2016, and the two men communicated for months about possible meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials.During those exchanges, Mr. Timofeev referred repeatedly to his contacts in Russia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, court records show.\u201cAt some point, he started asking whether it would be possible to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin or some other high-ranking Russian politicians,\u201d Mr. Timofeev said at the time. \u201cOur conversations made it clear that George was not well acquainted with the Russian foreign political landscape. You obviously can\u2019t just go and set up a meeting with the president, for instance. Things just aren\u2019t done that way.\u201dExactly how Mr. Mifsud first met Ms. Polonskaya, the Russian woman who attended the London cafe meeting in March 2016, is unclear.Mr. Mifsud did not reveal her name in that interview \u2014 and court records do not identify her \u2014 but The Times identified her through emails, interviews and other records.He said she was in London discussing a possible internship with Mr. Mifsud, a friend of hers, the morning before the meeting with Mr. Papadopoulos. He insisted that she had no connections to the Russian government and never portrayed herself as Mr. Putin\u2019s niece, despite the court records unsealed by Mr. Mueller.He said that she only exchanged pleasantries with Mr. Papadopoulos, and that she understood only about half of the discussion between Mr. Mifsud and Mr. Papadopoulos. He shared a text message from her in which she explained to him the reason: \u201cBecause my English was bad,\u201d it read.\u201cIt\u2019s totally ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Vinogradov said. \u201cShe\u2019s not interested in politics. She can barely tell the difference between Lenin and Stalin.\u201dSharon LaFraniere reported from Washington, David D.

Some of them wore high-tech prostheses that made them look superhuman.I wanted to throw my arms around them. I wanted to bake them pizzas. Instead, I told myself my silence was a form of respect. But it was really that I just didn\u2019t have the words.These vets would tell you they\u2019re not superhuman. \u201cI don\u2019t think the challenges in my life are any greater than anyone else\u2019s,\u201d Travis Mills says. \u201cI\u2019m just thankful I was able to serve my country.\u201dBut Mr. Mills, who served with the 82nd Airborne Division, was the reason the wounded veterans were here in my hometown, Belgrade, Me., in the first place.On April 10, 2012, during his third tour of duty in Afghanistan, Mr. Mills placed his backpack on the ground. A mine lay just below the surface. \u201cThe backpack touching the dirt was all it took,\u201d he says. \u201cSuch a simple act of war. My world erupted. I saw a flash of flame and heard a huge ka-boom.\u201dOnly five soldiers in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have survived the loss of both arms and legs. Mr. Mills is one of them.His journey back from that day tells the story not only of one man returning to life. It\u2019s also a story of how a small town has been transformed, and with it, given new hope to wounded soldiers and their families.Maybe Mr. Mills is already on your radar. His autobiography, \u201cAs Tough as They Come,\u201d was a best seller. A movie is in the works, with Adam Driver as Mr. Mills and Sylvester Stallone as his unsinkable father-in-law. A documentary, \u201cTravis: A Soldier\u2019s Story,\u201d is available on Netflix.I first met Mr. Mills at, of all places, a writers\u2019 conference in California. Even though we come from the same small town, and we\u2019re both authors, we\u2019d never met before.He told me about his project to transform an old estate into a place where wounded veterans and their families can gather, free of charge, for a week of community and conversation on the shores of a lake in Maine. Once, he said with a luminous grin, it had been owned by Elizabeth Arden.Everyone in town knows about the old Arden estate. From the 1930s to the 1970s it was called the Maine Chance resort, not only the glamorous home of the cosmetics magnate but a kind of Betty Ford Center of its day, a place where society ladies and Hollywood celebrities, among others, could escape to for the summer to dry out. Judy Garland stayed there. So did Mamie Eisenhower. The elegant mansion on the hill over the lake was once an essential part of the town\u2019s economy, not to mention an essential part of its mythology.But the Maine Chance fell into disrepair. Its tattered shell overlooked Arden Cove on Long Pond. A dirt path leading into the woods was still marked \u201cElizabeth Arden Road\u201d on a few old maps, but it was virtually impassable except by mountain bike or A.T.V.On a sunny Saturday in October, the new Travis Mills Foundation center for wounded veterans held an open house, and the elegant old grounds were full of vets and their families.\u201cLook, the V.A. does the best it can,\u201d a Vietnam-era mess sergeant told me, as we waited in line to have our photographs taken with Mr. Mills. \u201cBut it stays with you forever, once you\u2019ve served. You\u2019re never the same. People need places like this, places where vets can feel like they\u2019re not alone.\u201dNow, in rooms once graced by celebrities of yesteryear like Lilian Gish and Ava Gardner and Edna Ferber, wounded veterans and their families have that place. It has been made possible because of the support from donors, including the Barbara Bush Foundation, Wayfair and New Balance \u2014 but most of all because of the charisma of Mr. Mills.I left the open house wearing a bracelet imprinted with Mr. Mills\u2019s mantra: \u201cNever Give Up, Never Quit.\u201d Later, I took a bike ride through the woods along the old Elizabeth Arden Road. As I headed deeper and deeper into the woods, the road deteriorated until it wasn\u2019t much more than a gnarled footpath over the shoulders of McGaffey Mountain.At one particularly difficult hill, I got off of my bike and began walking it. Until I met Mr. Mills, I hadn\u2019t given much thought to the fact that I have two arms and two legs, that no one has ever tried to kill me, that there are millions of Americans who have given their lives to make my life possible. But I was thinking about it now.And then, just off to one side of the path, I saw a single grave, surrounded by a beaten split-rail fence. I put my bike down and walked into the woods to look at it.\u201cJohn Rogers,\u201d it said. Sgt. Continental Line. Revolutionary War. 1756-1849.

{"Headline": "Considering the Cost of Lower Taxes", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneAmerican tax policy must stand as one of the great mysteries of the global political economy.Nearly 50 years later, the tax picture has changed little in the United States. By 2015, the last year for which the O.E.C.D. has comparable data, the figure was 26.4 percent of G.D.P. But across the market democracies of the O.E.C.D., the share had climbed by an average of more than seven percentage points.Citizens of many countries that were poorer and little taxed in the 1960s, like Spain and Japan, today pay a much larger share of their incomes in taxes than their American counterparts. In some rich countries like Denmark, where taxes were already high in the 1960s, taxpayers now contribute almost 20 percentage points of G.D.P. more to the public purse than Americans do.Wagner\u2019s Law, named for the 19th-century German economist Adolph Wagner, states that government spending as a share of the economy will increase as nations get richer and their citizens demand more and better public services. This may approximate public policy in other industrialized nations. In the United States, it fails.Americans are paying dearly as a result, as their comparatively small government has proved incapable of providing an adequate safety net to protect those most vulnerable to globalization and technological change.And whatever apologists for small government might argue, there is no credible evidence that countries with higher tax rates necessarily grow less.Over the last couple of weeks, Republicans have offered legislation to cut taxes by $1.5 trillion over the next decade \u2014 more than half a percentage point of G.D.P. They assert a dire need to stimulate growth by encouraging corporations to invest in the United States.Beyond this criticism, though, the debate offers an opportunity to look closely at the mechanics \u2014 and consider the motivations \u2014 behind the nation\u2019s great divergence with the other market democracies of the West.Many of these efforts are likely to reduce income-tax revenue, as the Republicans\u2019 plans would. But the larger goals are radically different; they are also meant to enhance equity.Of 15 O.E.C.D. countries that changed their top income-tax rates for 2016 and later years, nine increased them and only six reduced them, the O.E.C.D. found. Most of the tax cuts were aimed at those below the top tier of earners: over all, 19 countries cut marginal income-tax rates for those not in the highest bracket, aiming to increase the take-home pay of average workers.Belgium eliminated its 30 percent tax bracket, the second highest, and raised the income threshold of the lowest bracket of 25 percent. In Austria, rates were reduced for all but top earners, whose marginal rate rose to 55 percent, from 50 percent. Canada and Luxembourg also aimed tax-rate cuts at middle-income earners.At the bottom of the income distribution, Belgium, Britain, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands all increased the ranks of those owing no tax. Austria also expanded its tax credits, while Finland and the Netherlands increased the top payout of the earned-income tax credit, and Ireland introduced such a credit for the low-income self-employed.To be sure, many tax changes in other rich countries benefit the rich. Inheritance taxes have declined in several other O.E.C.D. nations. The Republican proposition to cut corporate tax rates is hardly out of line: Most other advanced nations are doing the same thing.Still, reforms around the O.E.C.D. do not look quite like the American giveaways. For instance, countries that have cut corporate tax rates have also raised taxes on dividends \u2014 shifting the tax burden from corporations to their shareholders, and collecting the tax revenue somewhere.It is hard to conclude that the Republican proposal is about anything but that narrow sliver. If it succeeds, it will transform the United States from a low-tax country to a lower-tax one. And the mystery will persist: In cutting taxes as babies die and adults waste away in addiction, what do Americans mean by nation?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Kenyatta is Inaugurated, Kenyans Are Feeling Economic Pain", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Florence Makau once made $10 a day selling used clothes from inside a former shipping container, enough to feed her three children, pay their school fees and cover the rent. That was during better times in Kibera, a crowded working-class Nairobi neighborhood.Times are no longer that good in Kibera \u2014 or elsewhere in Kenya. Government institutions blame drought and rising oil prices, but another reason has afflicted Kenyans across the socioeconomic spectrum: Politics.Kenya endured an unexpectedly long and volatile election period, capped on Tuesday when Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in for a second term as president. Many hope his inauguration will end the country\u2019s political uncertainty, but much economic damage has already been done.\u201cIt\u2019s a lost year. Completely,\u201d said Emma Gordon, a senior analyst for sub-Saharan Africa at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk assessment firm.Investors know election season means an economic slowdown, and that the slump usually starts well before voting day. But this year Kenya conducted two presidential elections, nearly three months apart, because of an unprecedented Supreme Court ruling.Throughout, Kenya\u2019s economy has taken a significant hit.Kenya welcomed 15 percent fewer visitors in August \u2014 the month of the first presidential vote, also the peak of the tourist season and a crucial driver of the country\u2019s economy \u2014 than in July. Figures compiled monthly by Kenya\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics show the country\u2019s other major industries suffering as well. Key manufacturing indicators fell an average of nearly 20 percent compared with the same period last year. The agriculture sector also suffered, although the statistics bureau attributed that to drought.Kenya\u2019s Finance Ministry now expects economic growth of 5 percent this year, almost a full percentage point lower than its initial forecast.Official figures, however, hardly tell the whole story.\u201cThose numbers mask how much this affected your average Joe in Kenya,\u201d said Ms. Gordon, the analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s not been a good period for the average working Kenyan.\u201dThat is partly because women like Ms. Makau, the clothing seller in Kibera, are ignored in the government\u2019s figures, which do not measure the \u201cinformal economy\u201d composed of people who work as street vendors, drivers and casual laborers.Ms. Makau, 60, is feeling the stress. Her onetime daily income of $10 is now $5, if she\u2019s lucky. She is paying her rent piecemeal so that she does not have to skimp even more on meals for her children. Finding trendy fashions to hawk is a thing of the past.\u201cThe good stuff is gone,\u201d she said, sitting in her shop, a repurposed shipping container filled with faded castoffs she cannot sell. With virtually no revenue, she lacks the cash to buy new stock in styles her customers want.Across Kibera, Kawangware and Mathare \u2014 Nairobi neighborhoods that are home to hundreds of thousands of the working poor \u2014 people say there\u2019s just no money. And when pockets are empty, fruit and vegetables, and the investment they represent, rot on vendors\u2019 stands.Ritchie Oudu, who makes the bulk of his income selling DVDs in Kibera, has been unable to get new movies in three months. His suppliers, based in downtown Nairobi, are too afraid to visit the slums. He\u2019s dipping into his dwindling savings to pay university fees.Things are not much better in Nairobi\u2019s central business district. Small- and medium-sized retailers there say the prolonged election and frequent and sometimes violent political demonstrations drove customers away and provoked fears of vandalism.The election violence is not limited to street fights between ordinary Kenyans, who are usually paid a dollar or less to show support for one side or another. One businesswoman said clients at her men\u2019s wear shop frequently argued over politics. In one case, she said, two customers with opposing views came to blows.There are some signs of change. As Mr. Kenyatta prepared for his inauguration, Mr. Odinga canceled plans by his party to hold a parallel swearing-in of its \u201cpeople\u2019s president.\u201d But he later turned the tables, promising supporters at a rally that he would take such an oath next month, on the anniversary of Kenya\u2019s independence.Mr. Odinga\u2019s speech was cut short by police firing tear gas and, witnesses say, bullets. Members of Mr. Odinga\u2019s party say five people were shot, and two killed, during the afternoon\u2019s chaos.The skirmish, and Mr. Odinga\u2019s promise of continued provocation, undid feelings of relief in a city where many people, whatever their politics, say they simply want normality.Ms. Makau, the clothes seller, said she has no idea when she\u2019ll have enough money to restock. Mr. Oudu, 27, is still single, in a country where men are often married by that age, but says he lacks enough cash to date girls. Anna Mwenda, who sells phone credit in downtown Nairobi, cannot afford Christmas gifts for her five-year-old son, or the traditional holiday visit to see her family in rural Kenya.Jeremy Maganga, a 45-year-old scrap dealer in Kibera, said it is unclear when family life will feel normal again. He and his wife have found new weekend routines to avoid guests \u2014 and the social expectation of sharing food. Mr. Maganga sits at work Saturdays, though there\u2019s little business, and on Sundays after church, he and his wife and children loiter away from home.\u201cNormally we need visitors,\u201d he said, expressing an appreciation for the drop-ins that are common here. \u201cBut now, we reduce food at home by cutting them out. We cannot welcome anyone.\u201dTo say such a thing in Kenya is to admit both shame and defeat. Those feelings follow Mr. Maganga everywhere these days; he\u2019s even taken to dodging his wife and children, spending extra-long hours at work and hoping they are asleep when he comes home.He spends a few Kenyan shillings \u2014 no more than a dime or two \u2014 on mandaazi, a popular fried dough snack, for the children, just in case they are awake. It is his attempt, these days, at not disappointing them.\u201cThey\u2019re angry at me,\u201d he said of his family, \u201cthat I cannot provide.\u201dLenny Ruvaga contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Newest Film Festival Tests the Limits of Independence", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPingyao JournalPINGYAO, China \u2014 It seemed odd to meet an aspiring director at a film festival who pleaded not to be quoted. He was afraid, he explained, after a discussion about cinema in China veered into censorship and how it affects filmmakers working here.It is \u201cprobably like this in every country,\u201d he added.By accident of timing, the festival seems to have become an early test of what is acceptable in what is now being called the Xi era.He said he wanted to present artistic films that might otherwise struggle to reach a wide audience, at home and beyond. Mr. Jia called it the Pingyao Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon International Film Festival in homage to the 2000 martial-arts film by the director Ang Lee.It is impossible, to say the least, to imagine the governor\u2019s office in Utah screening the films to be shown at the Sundance in Park City, though that is exactly what officials in Shanxi Province, where Pingyao is, did for all 52 films shown here.Mr. Jia said independent filmmaking could still flourish in China, despite such restrictions. \u201cNearly 800 movies are made in China every year, among which there are many by talented young directors,\u201d he said.Directors and producers in attendance, even those who spoke frankly of the limits, agreed. There is, for now, still space for creativity, they said.Even so, it was also evident that the festival could not escape the gravitational pull of the country\u2019s politics. It was originally scheduled to open a week earlier, but when the dates for the party congress were announced, only weeks before it began, the festival\u2019s schedule had to shift accordingly.The delay was, naturally, the first question at the festival\u2019s opening news conference, prompting an evasive answer from its producer, Ye Ning, the chief executive of Huayi Brothers Media. (Despite its premiere here, its national release remains unscheduled.)Agang Yargyi, a Tibetan filmmaker who traveled from the western province of Sichuan to attend, expressed admiration for Mr. Feng\u2019s choice of a historical subject, calling it \u201cvery daring.\u201dMr. Agang, 27, has made three short films, including one, \u201cDream,\u201d that played in film festivals in Finland and Washington. He described the challenges facing filmmakers, heightened in his case by his ethnic ties to a sometimes restive region. He cannot get a visa, for example, to accompany his films on the festival circuit.\u201cChina is a country that doesn\u2019t like to review its history,\u201d he said.And yet China\u2019s troubled history is inescapable.The only cinema in Pingyao\u2019s old city, ironically, was a modern addition, built in 1965, just before the Communist leader Mao Zedong set the Cultural Revolution in motion. The cinema closed in 2003, but reopened last year as a museum.

{"Headline": "William Dudley, New York Fed President, Is Expected to Retire", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a vocal proponent of improving the \u201cculture\u201d at big banks, was expected to announce his retirement as early as this week, according to two people familiar with the decision.Mr. Dudley, 64, became president of the New York Fed in January 2009 when he replaced Timothy F. Geithner, who left to become treasury secretary under President Barack Obama.After joining the regional Fed bank in 2007, Mr. Dudley took the reins in the midst of an economic recession, as Wall Street was still reeling from the 2008 financial crisis. He was a key player in the Fed\u2019s efforts to shore up the economy, including its bond-buying campaign known as quantitative easing.Mr. Dudley\u2019s successor will play a crucial role in policing Wall Street as policymakers in Washington take steps to loosen some of the regulations that had been imposed on banks after the crisis.The next president of the New York Fed will also take Mr. Dudley\u2019s place as the vice chairman and a permanent voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decisions about interest rates and the purchase and sale of securities on the open market. Mr. Dudley has voted in favor of the Fed\u2019s current approach to monetary policy.\u201cI expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the F.O.M.C.\u2019s 2 percent objective over the medium term,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, even though inflation is currently somewhat below our longer-run objective, I judge that it is still appropriate to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually.\u201dUnlike the Fed chairman, regional Fed bank presidents are not political appointees and are not chosen by the president. They are selected by a committee composed of members of the Fed\u2019s board of directors who are not affiliated with financial institutions, and the selection is subject to approval by the Fed board in Washington.On Thursday, President Trump nominated Jerome H. Powell as the next Fed chairman, bypassing the current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, for a second term, in part because of her forceful defense of the post-crisis banking rules.While Mr. Powell is not seen as someone who will dismantle Wall Street regulation, Mr. Trump has made clear his desire to roll back many of the rules imposed on banks in the wake of the financial crisis. Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for Fed vice chairman of supervision, Randal K. Quarles, has spoken about the need to revise or rescind some banking rules.Soon after the financial crisis, a report on the New York Fed\u2019s practices by a Columbia University professor, David Beim, found that the regulator must be \u201cwilling to stand up to banks and demand both information and action,\u201d and was \u201ctoo risk-averse to respond quickly and flexibly to new challenges.\u201dMr. Dudley has been among the most outspoken critics of \u201ccultural failures\u201d at large financial institutions and has criticized their leadership for not doing enough to impose a strong tone at the top. In 2014, Mr. Dudley warned bank executives that regulators would consider breaking up big firms if they did not do enough to prevent wrongdoing.Before joining the New York Fed in 2007, Mr. Dudley had spent two decades at Goldman Sachs, where he was most recently the bank\u2019s chief economist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No One Knows What Britain Is Anymore", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBRUSSELS \u2014 Many Britons see their country as a brave galleon, banners waving, cannons firing, trumpets blaring. That is how the country\u2019s voluble foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, likes to describe it.But Britain is now but a modest-size ship on the global ocean. Having voted to leave the European Union, it is unmoored, heading to nowhere, while on deck, fire has broken out and the captain \u2014 poor Theresa May \u2014 is lashed to the mast, without the authority to decide whether to turn to port or to starboard, let alone do what one imagines she knows would be best, which is to turn around and head back to shore.I\u2019ve lived and worked for nine years in Britain, first during the Thatcher years and then again for the last four politically chaotic ones. While much poorer in the 1980s, Britain mattered internationally. Now, with Brexit, it seems to be embracing an introverted irrelevance.Britain \u2014 renowned for its pragmatism, its common sense, its political stability and its unabashed devotion to small business (\u201ca nation of shopkeepers\u201d) \u2014 has become nearly unrecognizable to its European allies.\u201cPeople need to look again at Britain,\u201d said Daniel Br\u00f6ssler, a correspondent for the German daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer the country they understood it to be their whole lives.\u201dMrs. May\u2019s Conservative government is now so split that some Brexit supporters are calling on her to simply quit the bloc with no deal at all \u2014 probably the worst alternative for the country, but just the kind of populist, tub-thumping gesture favored by the Brexit elite and the right-wing tabloids.Meanwhile, with the Conservative government so riven and rudderless, the old hard lefty Jeremy Corbyn is leading the opposition Labour Party back into an equally fantastical socialist past.Britain is undergoing a full-blown identity crisis. It is a \u201chollowed-out country,\u201d \u201cill at ease with itself,\u201d \u201cdeeply provincial,\u201d engaged in a \u201ccontrolled suicide,\u201d say puzzled experts. And these are Britain\u2019s friends.\u201cThe sense in the rest of Europe is bewilderment; how much worse can it get?\u201d said Tomas Valasek, a former Slovak diplomat who lived in Britain for many years and now directs Carnegie Europe, a Brussels-based research institution. \u201cAfter Brexit, no one is trying to help now. They\u2019ve given up. Nobody on the Continent really cares that much about Britain anymore. Even worse, people feel the country will fall into the hands of Jeremy Corbyn and that will do more damage than Brexit itself.\u201dMore chilling, perhaps, is the impact on countries less rooted than Britain once appeared to be. \u201cBritain is an example for all of us, as a longstanding democracy, with centuries of the rule of law and traditional institutions,\u201d said Guntram Wolff, a German economist who runs the Bruegel research institution here. \u201cAnd if such a country has such difficulties, most of us wonder how our own countries would handle such political upheaval \u2014 whether we, too, are so vulnerable.\u201dSome make the comparison to that other great Anglo-Saxon country, the United States, under President Trump, who saw Brexit as a harbinger of his own election. But however politically divided the United States seems now, Europeans have never considered it a touchstone of stability the way they have Britain.Jan Techau, a German who has traveled extensively in England and ran Carnegie Europe, sees Britain as a tragedy. The European country considered the most outward-looking and globalized is fractured by the backlash against the very model that made Britain strong. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad, but Brexit is a controlled suicide,\u201d he said.There are many who see Britain as having suffered a sudden nervous breakdown, said Simon Tilford, an economist and deputy director of the Center for European Reform. But he believes that Britain\u2019s political culture and economic stability have been eroding for some time, hidden by the longstanding willingness of others to give it the benefit of the doubt as a pragmatic democracy with a strong civil society and civil service.He too blames the Conservatives and the right-wing tabloids that support them for much of the erosion. \u201cThe readiness of the political right in particular to lie and peddle obvious untruths, to place their party politics and party unity over and above the national interest, has been going on for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe harrumphing nationalism masks a country ill at ease with itself.\u201dRather than a vote for a global Britain and economic liberalism, Mr. Tilford said, Brexit was a vote for protectionism, and its political system now \u201cis deeply provincial and introverted at a time when Britain is supposed to be heading out into the world.\u201dThe divisions in the society \u2014 over Brexit, over politics \u2014 are both a function and a result of Britain\u2019s confusion about its identity and global importance. The 19th-century myth of Britain as the \u201cworkshop of the world,\u201d a doughty Protestant nation surrounded by Catholics with an empire on which the sun never set, confronted a post-World War II reality, when a lot of these tales stopped being true, suggests Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.Britain became a service economy, the empire disappeared and people stopped identifying with the Church of England. Then Margaret Thatcher arrived, and with her, Mr. Leonard said, \u201cthere was a last gasp of this old identity \u2014 an ethnic, exclusively white and backward-looking version of Englishness.\u201dHowever successful, it also excluded an increasingly large number of Britons \u2014 black, Asian and Muslim \u2014 who felt disenfranchised from \u201cthe national story.\u201d Tony Blair and New Labour moved toward more inclusiveness and cosmopolitanism and openness to Europe, too.But those validated by the old identity then felt like strangers in their own land, Mr. Leonard said. \u201cTheir revenge was Brexit.\u201dConfused and divided, Britain no longer has an agreed-upon national narrative, said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform. \u201cIn the 2012 Olympics we had one,\u201d he said. \u201cGlobal Britain, open Britain, generous Britain.\u201d But now there is a competition between that narrative and the nativist one.Mr. Grant, like others who have spent their careers watching British and European politics, predicts rough seas for Britain as it casts off nearly 45 years of intimate trade and legal ties with those annoying Europeans.\u201cEverywhere I go,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople are asking me, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with your country?\u2019 \u201dSteven Erlanger, the chief diplomatic correspondent for The New York Times, just completed four years as London bureau chief.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Form of Literary Alchemy That Resurrects the Past", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionFor those writers desiring to summon a lost past, especially as a way to re-enter childhood memory, the most pressing challenge is almost always one of resurrection: how to make what has already happened, that which can never happen again, feel as if it were still happening.In her entrancing fiction debut, \u201cSwallowing Mercury,\u201d the poet Wioletta Greg achieves a form of literary alchemy that mesmerizes for its ability to situate us inside a personal landscape where both the eternal past and the unfolding present feel as if they can exist simultaneously.Although set in a fictional village in rural Poland in the 1970s and 1980s, Greg\u2019s book \u2014 which was longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize and elegantly translated by Eliza Marciniak \u2014 very clearly lays its claim to the territory of autobiography, as we progress through a series of tightly drawn scenes that suggest with flip-book-like economy the narrator\u2019s progression from birth to adolescence. And yet it expands the potential of the personal by also asserting that this is a memoir of place, as Greg describes in loving detail a village she calls Hektary, and all that it contains: a world where pagan and Catholic tradition exist side by side, where \u201ca poultice of parboiled cabbage leaves\u201d and \u201ca greasing with mutton and dog tallow\u201d is trusted as much as any chemist\u2019s prescription, and where experience is defined not \u201cby field margins overgrown with thistles and goosefoot, by cobbled roads, fences or tracks trodden by humans, but instead by light, sound and the elements.\u201dAt the same time, as much as such idyll is celebrated, it is also beautifully complicated by Greg\u2019s precise, evocative and, at times, delightfully unsettling prose, the gritty never sacrificed for the sake of simply being pretty. The air of August smells of \u201crotting mattress straw, laundry starch, mildew and cat piss.\u201d At the family\u2019s kitchen table, \u201cthe blood of the weasel that my father had stuffed the previous week was still clotting in the cracks.\u201dGreg trains our gaze on the smallest things \u2014 the blood of the weasel, the straw of the mattress \u2014 and yet there is also a much larger historical concern that forms the book\u2019s whispered background: The narrator\u2019s coming-of-age coincides with the last troubled days of Soviet-style Communism, and so even the most simply stated memories can\u2019t help being laced with a strange, aching tension. Such as when the narrator is called into the headmistress\u2019s office after she submits an entry to a state-run art competition \u2014 \u201cMoscow through your eyes\u201d \u2014 upon which ink had been accidentally spilled so that \u201cit looked as if the capital of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was being engulfed by a viscous ocean of indigo.\u201d The suited man who meets her in the office, who identifies himself only as someone who has \u201cmade a special trip all the way from the provincial government to reward your work,\u201d offers first chocolate, then the following question: \u201cAnd who might have given you this \u2026 interesting idea?\u201dThe moment, full of quiet menace, is deliberately pointillistic, the reader left to infer what is not being said \u2014 which feels in keeping with a history that depended as much on silence as what was actually spoken, where so much had to be communicated through elision or omission as a matter of survival. Also ghosting the edges of this idea are the lasting repercussions of learning, from a very young age, what not to say when telling a story in order to spare lives.For even as the narrator learns the vulnerabilities of those around her \u2014 the combine driver who, in his drunkenness, blurts the name of a lost love; the village seamstress, and the succor she seeks in a locked room; the grandmother who loses her firstborn; the narrator\u2019s father, who loses his own mother far too young \u2014 the narrator, in the moment, keeps their secrets. At the same time, by remembering them as she does now, summoning them, in retrospect, through the most intimate details \u2014 she envisions her father, for example, calling for his lost mother under \u201ca horse blanket and fresh walnut leaves, so that bedbugs wouldn\u2019t bother him\u201d \u2014 she also finds a way to \u201ckeep\u201d these secrets in the sense that one also associates with, say, taxidermy, a ritual that runs through the book, and which is conducted by the narrator\u2019s father at the kitchen table with a surprising tenderness that the narrator regards as almost holy, his supplies \u201canointed with alum and dried Butapren glue.\u201dThe paradox of taxidermy, of course, is the way it both reanimates and stills \u2014 which is also perhaps the most poignant and complex achievement of Greg\u2019s particular resurrection: She makes us feel the enduring presence of what is already gone.Inara Verzemnieks teaches in the University of Iowa\u2019s nonfiction writing program and is the author of a memoir, \u201cAmong the Living and the Dead.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Lessons Seattle Can Teach Other Cities About Amazon", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon, the colossus of internet commerce that was founded here, is conducting the most dramatic sweepstakes of modern capitalism in throwing open a competition for a coequal second headquarters. The company has promised to create about 50,000 new jobs at HQ2, as Amazon is calling it, paralleling the similar number the company plans to employ here over the next couple of years.Six-figure salaries, real-estate investments and economic ripple effects \u2014 from health care for all those new workers to the hash browns being served for breakfast \u2014 could inject $50 billion or more into the winning town, economists say. Proposals from 43 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, as well as Canada and Mexico, are now being considered, with a decision scheduled for sometime next year.For Seattle, Amazon has become far more than a big employer and taxpayer. It reshaped how the city sees itself and, in turn, is seen by the world. It created a vast, gleaming new campus in a once derelict corner of the city, but also raised deep concerns about housing costs, traffic congestion and potential over-dependence on one corporation.In interviews with experts and residents, from tech company offices to chambers of commerce, here are the lessons from Seattle for all those cities now seeking the Amazon prize.The second Amazon headquarters will unquestionably have a major impact on whichever city gets the nod. But Amazon did not start from scratch.A collective corporate cultural ethos had been built as well by other companies that arose from a city of working waterfronts and gloomy skies. REI, Eddie Bauer, Starbucks, Nordstrom and Costco \u2014 not to mention Microsoft and Boeing \u2014 shaped the economic rootstock that Amazon grew from, and created an assumption by many Seattle residents that corporations should be involved in the community as civic leaders.\u201cThere isn\u2019t an obvious candidate where they\u2019re going to get the same confluence of features,\u201d said Fred H. Smith, a professor of urban economic history at Davidson College in North Carolina, who has evaluated the bid by his state\u2019s leading HQ2 contender, Charlotte.Seattle hit a sweet spot with the company\u2019s rise, Professor Smith said, as Amazon tapped into an existing rich pool of talent and resources, from the University of Washington\u2019s strengths in computer science, to cheap electricity from the Pacific Northwest\u2019s connections to hydropower dams in the Columbia River basin.\u201cFinding a city that has all of those things is a tough goal,\u201d he said.A company that started out selling books became one of the inventors of cloud computing as a business, selling not just goods but the invisible machinery of internet commerce itself. It has leapt into the grocery business with the recent acquisition of Whole Foods. It made a decision that employees could bring their dogs to work, and on any given day, about 1,200 pets are roaming the 33 buildings of the urban campus in the South Lake Union area.The message to HQ2 cities is clear: What you get now will probably not be what Amazon becomes.Change and churn have become part of the Amazon brand, and thus the Seattle brand, business people said. In the past seven years, coinciding with Amazon\u2019s biggest growth spurt, the number of Fortune 500 companies with an office in Seattle quadrupled, to 31 from seven, many of them hunkering down as closely as they can to Amazon.\u201cThere\u2019s an ecosystem that has been really enhanced because of Amazon,\u201d said Josh Simms, the chief executive of H5 Data Centers, a company based in Los Angeles that provides space for cloud-computing companies. \u201cAmazon brought a lot of young, smart people into Seattle, so now all the big tech companies feel they need to be there as well,\u201d he said.Critics still complain that Amazon is not involved enough as a corporate citizen. But one of the company\u2019s new office buildings will have a shelter for 200 homeless women, children and families built into the tower itself \u2014 the first such design in the world, company officials said.\u201cI still look at Amazon as a young company, a teenager,\u201d said Maud Daudon, the president of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThey\u2019re on a path.\u201dIn Seattle, the company\u2019s growth became the catalyst for forces of anti-growth as housing prices soared and traffic worsened. The nation\u2019s first big-city $15-an-hour wage was passed here as Amazon rose. Home prices have risen faster in recent years than in any place in America.\u201cAmazon is simultaneously one of the most loved and most hated of organizations. It\u2019s this incredibly schizophrenic relationship,\u201d said David Rolf, the president of the Service Employees International Union 775, which represents 45,000 health care workers.Defenders of the company\u2019s impact said the huge and expensive expansion of mass transit that is underway now might not have happened if a sudden worsening of traffic had not underscored the need; voters rejected transit expansions multiple times here in the past.Others, like Will Martin, an architect who was walking on a recent morning near his office downtown, worry that the city could become too much of a one-company town, the way it felt in the old days when Boeing would sneeze and the city would pull up the blankets and stay in bed.Brace for a transformation of housing, demography and consumer demand. Here in Seattle, a city still defined by neighborhoods of single-family homes, about 8,000 new apartments are under construction within walking distance of the Amazon campus and are expected to be taken, the company says, mostly by employees. About 20 percent of the company\u2019s 40,000 workers already do not take any motorized transportation at all \u2014 they walk or bike. And more than one in six live and work in the same ZIP code.\u201cAll of a sudden you\u2019re going to get 50,000 requests \u2014 why is the Wi-Fi not faster around here?\u201d said Mike Metzger, the chief executive at Payscale, a wage-analytics company that was founded in Seattle by three executives from Microsoft, and now has dozens of former Amazon workers in its 450-person work force.Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said the stresses and opportunities are combined.\u201cOther cities would kill to have the problems that Seattle has,\u201d he said. The priority, in his view, should be preserving the elements that allowed and encouraged Amazon to put down seeds and grow. \u201cWhat we want to do is maintain the culture that attracted Bezos in the first place,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The G.O.P.\u2019s 20th-Century Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWith this week\u2019s House floor vote and a Senate Finance Committee markup, the Republican tax plan is hurtling toward passage by year\u2019s end \u2014 a timeline that is frenzied compared to that of previous tax reform efforts, which took years and extensive debate. Many people in both parties believe the tax code needs to be modernized, especially regarding how businesses are taxed. Yet the policy choices Republicans have pursued in their grand reformation of business taxation reflect a pre-digital, pre-global economy. With their bill, they may well ensure that the United States economy is left behind once and for all.Republicans have promised simplification of the tax system. Instead, they have introduced even more complexity. This results, in part, from their choice to favor certain business activities over others, substituting congressional judgment for market pressures. And the privileged sectors are precisely those that are in decline.Take the bills\u2019 treatment of pass-through business income. In the House bill, such income is taxed at a maximum 25 percent rate, down from as high as 39.6 percent today, with a 9 percent rate for the first $75,000 of small-business income. As of Tuesday evening, the Senate plan would create a new deduction for a portion of such income, effectively capping the rate at around 32 percent. In both plans, these tax incentives are substantially smaller for businesses involving personal services \u2014 accountants, for example, or yoga instructors.In September, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin justified the exclusion of personal services from the tax cut by arguing that other industries, like manufacturing, created jobs. But manufacturing\u2019s share of the economy is only 13 percent, a share that is shrinking because of technology and outsourcing. Meanwhile, the service industry has grown significantly in the last several decades, and now employs about 10 times as many workers.What\u2019s more, under the House bill, the pass-through rate has a bias for owners of capital over laborers, a choice that is out of step in a world of rising inequality. Passive investors in active businesses would be able to obtain the low rate on all of their income from those businesses, whereas people who work for a living largely would get the low rate for only 30 percent of their business income.Even more perversely, taxpayers can raise this 30 percent threshold by making more capital investments \u2014 for example by purchasing robots and machinery to replace employees. This is apparently part of an overall scheme to punish workers: the evisceration of the estate tax, the reduction in the corporate rate and the increased tax burdens on education all allocate precious government resources to financial, rather than human, capital.Another pressing goal of tax reform is to reduce the incentives for companies to move their operations overseas. But again, the bill does the opposite.The House bill proposes an international tax system that would subject income of high-profit foreign subsidiaries to a 10 percent minimum tax. Senate Republicans have also proposed a minimum tax on foreign earnings, at a 12.5 percent rate on income from intangible assets, such as patents and copyrights.This new international tax system is a compromise between a territorial system, which would exempt foreign income altogether, and a worldwide system, which would tax all income, foreign or domestic, on basis at the same rate. This quasi-territorial approach would create a system unlike any other in the world today, applying different tax rates depending on where the income is earned.In fact, both plans largely maintain pressures for companies to locate corporate residency abroad, despite their claim to reduce taxes on corporate income. After all, a company that moves its residency to a tax haven can often achieve zero taxation, rather than being taxed at the American minimum rate, however low. Both plans have safeguards against this by increasing the tax burden on certain inbound investments, but these can be avoided by selling through independent distributors rather than related parties, among other strategies. And even then, business lobbying has already caused the House to scale back on its original proposal \u2014 a dynamic that does not bode well for the Senate\u2019s counterpart measure.Rather than revising the definition of corporate residency to account for factors such as the location of a company\u2019s headquarters or shareholders, the House and Senate plans retain the place of incorporation as the sole determinant of corporate residency, a notoriously artificial definition that has become disconnected from economic reality. They also largely subscribe to the fiction that one can identify a specific geographic locale where income is produced.Instead of modernizing the taxation of business income, Republicans have doubled down on outdated concepts like corporate residence and origin of income that have become meaningless in a global and digital economy, while also attempting to preserve dying industries. The result is a dizzyingly complex system that will interfere with market forces.Other countries have increasingly relied on consumption taxes as pro-growth alternatives to traditional business income taxes. The United States, however, remains wedded by politics and ideology to an inefficient, easily manipulated and antiquated tax policy. Rather than driving the United States to be a competitive force in the 21st century, the Republicans\u2019 plans hold the United States back in the last one.Rebecca M.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts Are Likely to Increase Trade Deficit", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has promised to cut federal taxes and reduce the nation\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of world \u2014 two economic priorities that are in direct conflict with each other.A wide range of experts agree that cutting taxes is likely to increase the trade deficit, which measures the difference between what the United States imports from other countries, like televisions and fruit, and what it exports, like cars and meat.In fact, a larger trade deficit is not a byproduct of the tax plan \u2014 it is the heart of the plan. The administration has said its $1.5 trillion tax cut will not balloon the federal budget deficit because the plan will generate enough economic growth to essentially pay for itself. The most optimistic projections of the likely economic benefits of the tax cuts are driven by increased trade deficits.The connection between tax cuts and trade deficits is not controversial. The mechanics are straightforward: Republicans are proposing to reduce federal revenue through a $1.5 trillion tax cut without a commensurate reduction in federal spending. To pay for the tax cuts, the government will need to borrow more dollars, some of which will come from foreign investors. Foreigners will get those dollars by selling more goods and services to Americans, which will widen the trade gap.\u201cThere may not be much that macroeconomists can predict with accuracy, but a large tax cut will lead to a budget deficit, which will lead to a trade deficit,\u201d said Jeffrey Frankel, a professor of economics at Harvard.\u201cWe are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible,\u201d he said.The inconsistency does not trouble the many economists and Republicans who do not share Mr. Trump\u2019s overarching view on the downsides of trade. From their perspective, the point of the tax plan is to increase investment in the United States, and there is no reason to shun foreign dollars.Gavin Ekins, a research economist at the conservative Tax Foundation, said Mr. Trump\u2019s objectives were still aligned in the longer term because increased investment would expand the nation\u2019s economic output over time, which could narrow the trade deficit.\u201cWe think that of course you\u2019re going to have to go through a period in which you have higher trade deficits,\u201d Mr. Ekins said. \u201cBut expanding capital investment means we\u2019ll produce more than we used to, and that is going to increase the exports that we have.\u201dWilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, offered a similar reconciliation of the administration\u2019s conflicting objectives this week.\u201cJob creation is the real purpose of reducing the trade deficit,\u201d Mr. Ross said during an interview at the Wall Street Journal C.E.O. Council. \u201cThe way we mainly wish to reduce the trade deficit is by increasing our exports as opposed to constricting imports.\u201dAnother option would be to fund government borrowing through the Federal Reserve, which could create money to buy federal debt, as it did on a large scale in the years after the 2008 financial crisis. But the Fed has embarked on a plan to reduce its holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. That leaves domestic and foreign investors as the potential buyers of the debt the United States will need to sell to pay for its tax cut.While economists agree that the tax cuts will widen the trade deficit, they part company on how much of the money that the federal government needs will come from foreigners.The answer will help to determine how much of a lift the cuts give the economy. When the government borrows from Americans, it is soaking up money that could have been used by the private sector. When it borrows from foreigners, more money is available for other uses.\u201cTo get bigger growth effects, you need more foreign capital coming in,\u201d said Kent Smetters, a professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania and the faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model. \u201cThat is the irony \u2014 tax cuts have the biggest effects if you\u2019re assuming that trade actually increases over time.\u201dForeigners hold about 40 percent of federal debt, and Mr. Smetters projects that they will continue to do so. His model projects that the government would need to issue $2 trillion in additional debt for the tax cuts over the next decade, and that foreigners would buy $800 billion.That would add $80 billion to the annual trade deficit \u2014 significantly more than, for example, America\u2019s $56 billion trade deficit with Mexico last year.The Trump administration regards the trade deficit as a drain on the economy. Mr. Trump has said other nations are stealing from the United States by selling goods and services to Americans without spending just as much money on American goods and services.Most economists, by contrast, see the trade deficit as a crude measuring stick that says little about the health of the domestic economy. This includes economists who think trade has imposed significant costs. The disruptions caused by trade are determined by the volume, not the balance. The workers at an Ohio factory that moves to Mexico do not benefit directly if a German company opens a comparable factory in Tennessee.But the biggest proponents of the tax cuts \u2014 excepting the Trump administration \u2014 also tend to be cheerleaders for increasing foreign trade.And it is their projections that the Trump administration has embraced in arguing that the tax plan moving through Congress will generate enough economic growth to let the government collect the same revenue at lower tax rates. Mr. Kotlikoff, for example, projects the tax cuts will not increase the federal debt over the long term \u2014 because of foreign investment.Mr. Kotlikoff regards this as a good thing. He said Americans were not saving enough money, so the best way to fund the investments necessary to increase economic growth was to import the money, expanding the nation\u2019s trade deficit.\u201cDoes that bother me?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201dHe said the administration appeared not to understand the mechanics of his analysis, or similar analyses \u2014 or the workings of its own plan.\u201cThis is a White House that does not know economics,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed a quotation about the Republican tax cuts and economic growth. The speaker was Gavin Ekins, not Scott Greenberg, of the Tax Foundation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "President Trump\u2019s Thing for Thugs", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAuthoritarian leaders exercise a strange and powerful attraction for President Trump. As his trip to Asia reminds us, a man who loves to bully people turns to mush \u2014 fawning smiles, effusive rhetoric \u2014 in the company of strongmen like Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines.Mr. Trump\u2019s obsessive investment in personal relations may work for a real estate dealmaker. But the degree to which he has chosen to curry favor with some of the world\u2019s most unsavory leaders, while lavishing far less attention on America\u2019s democratic allies, hurts America\u2019s credibility and, in the long run, may have dangerous repercussions.It\u2019s not uncommon for American presidents to foster relations with strongmen. Serving the national interest often means working with leaders who are undemocratic, corrupt, adversarial or all three, and for decades there was no alternative to dealing with whoever had the top job in the Kremlin. People still talk about how na\u00efve President George W. Bush was when he looked into Mr. Putin\u2019s eyes in 2001 and declared the Russian president \u201ctrustworthy.\u201d President Barack Obama stuck with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the democratically elected president of Turkey, long after Mr. Erdogan evolved into a dictator. The Chinese and Saudi leaders were favorites of President George H. W. Bush. President Richard Nixon assiduously cultivated China\u2019s Mao Zedong, the shah of Iran and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.Still, whatever their strengths and weaknesses, these past presidents worked within a structure of longstanding alliances and, in varying degrees, espoused support for democratic values, including the rule of law and human rights, all the while trying to nudge the autocrats along a similar path. President George H. W. Bush and others encouraged democracy in Russia; President Bill Clinton did likewise in China and Peru; President George W. Bush did in Iraq and Afghanistan.Mr. Trump chafes at sharing power with Congress and the courts and invokes the importance of human rights only against governments he despises, like North Korea, Iran and Cuba. Insecure, delusional and frustrated at his inability to act unilaterally, he sees himself as uniquely tough and the only person in his administration capable of achieving foreign policy goals.So what is his scorecard? Russia and China supported his push for tougher sanctions on North Korea. (They did so as well under Mr. Obama.) But there is no sign that China, whose support is vital, has enforced them in a way that will halt North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. China has not moved to open up its economy, as Mr. Trump has demanded. Russia has cooperated to some extent on Syria but not on Ukraine.At home, Mr. Trump\u2019s determination to arrogate power unto himself has seriously weakened the State Department and the cadre of professional diplomats that is central to successful international problem-solving. It has effectively sidelined people like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. It has left to other nations the important tasks of pursuing goals like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. In major ways, he is dealing America out of the game.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Opens Asia Trip Talking Tough in Campaign-Style Rally", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 President Trump kicked off an extensive swing through Asia with a campaign-style rally on Sunday with American troops in Japan, as he looked toward a lengthy trip likely to be dominated by talks on confronting the nuclear threat from North Korea.In a speech after Air Force One landed at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo on a crisp, sunny morning, Mr. Trump never mentioned Pyongyang by name. Sounding a militaristic tone, he sought to project toughness in the face of global challenges, saying the United States armed forces stood ready to defend itself and its allies and \u201cfight to overpower\u201d its adversaries.\u201cNo one \u2014 no dictator, no regime and no nation \u2014 should underestimate, ever, American resolve,\u201d Mr. Trump said, having shed his suit jacket for a leather bomber jacket as he addressed hundreds of fatigues-clad women and men. \u201cYou are the greatest threat to tyrants and dictators who seek to prey on the innocent.\u201dBreaking with tradition for American presidents on foreign soil, Mr. Trump used his speech to promote his domestic record with a distinct political edge, asserting that the economy and military were far better off since he became president.\u201cWe are back home starting to do, I will tell you \u2014 and you\u2019re reading, and you\u2019re seeing \u2014 really, really well,\u201d Mr. Trump told the troops, noting that the stock market has surged and unemployment has been low, with almost two million jobs added \u201csince a very, very special day \u2014 it\u2019s called Election Day.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve dealt ISIS one brutal defeat after another, and it\u2019s about time,\u201d he added, then noting that he had proposed increases in the defense budget. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot different than in the past.\u201dOn Monday morning, Mr. Trump spoke to Japanese and American business executives, striking familiar themes about the success of his economic polices and issuing a call for new a trade relationship with Japan.\u201cWe want fair and open trade,\u201d Mr. Trump declared, \u201cbut right now, our trade with is Japan is not fair and it\u2019s not open.\u201d He predicted the United States and Japan would be able to negotiate a new deal that would greatly expand trade.On his way to Japan, Mr. Trump told reporters he would probably meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia next week to discuss the North Korean threat, part of his 12-day, five-country tour through Asia that is also likely to focus heavily on trade.White House officials had said that a meeting by Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin \u2014 who last held face-to-face talks in Hamburg, Germany, in July \u2014 was a possibility on the sideline of the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Da Nang, Vietnam.\u201cWe want Putin\u2019s help on North Korea,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The White House also signaled that Mr. Trump could decide on this trip to designate North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism, a largely symbolic move since it is already among the world\u2019s most heavily sanctioned countries. Still, the gesture would reinforce the administration\u2019s efforts to cast the North as a global pariah.Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, and other administration officials are looking at the prospect \u201cvery closely,\u201d a senior White House official told reporters in Tokyo on Sunday, and a decision will come \u201cvery soon.\u201dThe president used his speech on Sunday to call for building a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific\u201d region, a new approach to Asia that is likely to be seen by China as a challenge. The idea, first proposed by the Japanese and adopted in recent days by Mr. Tillerson, envisions the United States strengthening ties with three other democracies in the region \u2014 Japan, Australia and India \u2014 to contain a rising China.\u201cWe will seek new opportunities for cooperation and commerce, and we will partner with friends and allies to pursue a free and open Indo-Pacific region,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe will seek free fair and reciprocal trade.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s trip to the continent will be the longest by an American president in more than 25 years, with additional stops in South Korea, China and the Philippines. Ahead of what his advisers called a grueling schedule of meetings and summits, the president got a chance to relax by playing golf on Sunday afternoon with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at Kasumigaseki Country Club.The outing was reciprocation for rounds that Mr. Trump hosted in Jupiter, Fla. and nearby West Palm Beach in February for Mr. Abe and Ernie Els, once the world\u2019s top golfer. For Sunday\u2019s round, Mr. Abe invited Hideki Matsuyama, a Japanese golfer ranked fourth in the world. Before the game, the Japanese prime minister presented Mr. Trump with white caps in the style of the president\u2019s trademark red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d trucker hats; Mr. Abe\u2019s were emblazoned in gold: \u201cDonald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.\u201d\u201cPrime Minister Abe is called a trainer of wild animals,\u201d said Fumio Hirai, a commentator on a morning news show on Fuji TV. \u201cAnd the world is watching how he does with President Trump.\u201dThe already extensive trip grew longer still on Friday when Mr. Trump abruptly announced to reporters that he would attend the East Asia Summit in Manila on Nov. 14, adding a day to his travels.\u201cIt is grueling, they tell me, but fortunately, historically that has not been a problem for me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t stay fresh, you\u2019ll be the first to tell me. I\u2019ll stay fresh.\u201dWhite House officials have framed the trip as a chance for Mr. Trump to showcase his warm relationships with world leaders including Mr. Abe and President Xi Jinping of China, as well as to demand trade deals more favorable to the United States after his decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But it will also highlight the uncertainty in the region and around the world about what to expect from the Trump administration, and the degree to which major powers are charting their own course in the absence of clear signals from the United States.Mr. Trump denied being at a disadvantage when reporters noted on Sunday that Mr. Xi was in a particularly powerful position.\u201cExcuse me, so am I,\u201d Mr. Trump said, citing stock market gains and low unemployment in the United States, and asserting that \u201cISIS is virtually defeated in the Middle East.\u201d\u201cWe are coming off some of the strongest numbers we\u2019ve ever had, and he knows that and he respects that,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Xi. \u201cWe\u2019re going in with tremendous strength.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s ability to stay on message during a lengthy and physically demanding trip will most likely be tested, with many opportunities for gaffes or intemperate language.On Sunday, North Korea\u2019s state media accused Mr. Trump of provoking the country with \u201cfoolish remarks\u201d and said \u201cthe only and one way for checking his rash act is to tame him with absolute physical power.\u201d The commentary in North Korea\u2019s state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun added: \u201cWe warn Trump\u2019s coteries once again. If they want to avoid ruin, do not make reckless remarks.\u201d\u201cThe president will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously,\u201d Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president really modulates his language \u2014 have you noticed him do that?\u201dEric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington, Motoko Rich from Tokyo and Choe Sang-hun from Seoul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany and the Age of Political Absolutism", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 It was the most preposterous mic drop in German history. On Sunday night, after 56 days of four-party talks on forming a coalition government, the pro-business Free Democratic Party abruptly pulled out of the negotiations, effectively ending them.Germany\u2019s parliamentary democracy is a system with compromise in its DNA \u2014 so when Germans awoke to the news Monday morning, they were shocked. Such a failure is a challenge to Germany\u2019s new role in the world. And it is yet another example of the dangerous political absolutism sweeping the world\u2019s democracies.In the national election of Sept. 24, six parties earned enough votes to get seated in the Bundestag \u2014 most notably, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany party, known as AfD. The Christian Democratic Union, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, is the largest, but with just over 34 percent of the seats, it needs a robust coalition to form a majority government.Since all parties reject joining a coalition with the AfD, there are only two possible combinations: another grand coalition between the center-left Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats \u2014 an option the Social Democrats have rejected after a major electoral defeat \u2014 or a four-party coalition of the Christian Democrats, its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union, the Greens and the Free Democrats (in Germany we call this the \u201cJamaica coalition,\u201d because the parties\u2019 colors mimic the green, yellow and black Jamaican flag).The decision by Christian Lindner, the head of the Free Democrats, to withdraw leaves Germany with the following bad options: The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, could still propose Ms. Merkel as chancellor to the Bundestag; he could then either ask her to form a minority government or to dissolve the Parliament and order new elections. Few people want new elections, which is why Mr. Steinmeier is urging the Free Democrats and Social Democrats to reconsider. \u201cAll parties involved should pause for a moment and reconsider their positions,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cWhoever runs in an election to claim political responsibility must not duck out when he holds it in his hands.\u201d (On Monday, Ms. Merkel said new elections may be a better option.)Germany\u2019s fear of political instability goes deep. For many, the AfD\u2019s entrance into the Bundestag brings to mind the dark shadow of the Weimar Republic, its disastrous collapse and all that followed. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has featured a series of German historians mining the parallels between the 1920s and \u201930s and today: Back then, a divided political spectrum and a splintered left, with extremism on both sides, created a run of minority governments and a perception of political chaos, all of which made Nazi authoritarianism look like an attractive alternative.Given all the obvious differences between then and now, one could shrug off the hand-wringing as historical trauma made obsolete by Germany\u2019s political and constitutional reality. The federal republic is not Weimar; it is one of the world\u2019s most stable political systems. There may be a few weeks of political chaos, but in the end, someone will be an adult and think twice. Or we will have new elections and deal out a new hand of cards. I am still convinced that the AfD, which won 12.6 percent of the votes in September, has pretty much exploited its electoral capacity.But \u201cwe\u2019re not Weimar\u201d is not exactly comforting. Germany\u2019s political system is based on the ability to compromise. All German governments since 1949 have been coalition governments and so far, they have always worked. The rise of populism has complicated all this, and not only in mathematical terms. Mr. Lindner\u2019s decision also shows that the AfD has corrupted the ability to compromise in a more fundamental way. It has managed to discredit compromise as a core value of democracy.On Monday, Germany was still speculating about Mr. Lindner\u2019s reasons for ending the talks. Strategic questions may have played an important role. Mr. Lindner rebuilt the Free Democrats from scratch after the party got so few votes in 2013 that it was kicked out of the Bundestag. Maybe he felt it was simply too early to join a complicated liaison \u00e0 quatre. But there\u2019s an all-too-familiar brutality in the decision that is not just the consequence of Mr. Lindner\u2019s cold, surgical intelligence.When asked during a news conference on Monday afternoon why he dropped out of the talks, Mr. Lindner listed areas where the negotiations didn\u2019t yield the results his party wanted. The other parties would agree only to a gradual elimination of the \u201cSoli,\u201d a tax used to help the economies of former East German regions. The Free Democrats had also sought limits on immigration, but the Greens insisted on exceptions for humanitarian reasons. These are completely normal and necessary compromises \u2014 but the Free Democrats apparently feared that their voters would be told by the AfD that the party had sold them out for a chance to rule.The sudden end of the talks is a huge blow to Germany\u2019s global image as a stable, responsible power. Compared to what is at stake on the global level, the discussion on when to end the Soli looks tiny. But then it is exactly this, the disdain for what seem like petty concerns in the name of compromise, that has fed the rise of populism in the first place.Mr. Lindner and others need the political courage not just to compromise, but to explain to the public why compromise is vital to German democracy.The next weeks will show which is stronger in Germany: the fear of new elections or a minority government and all its Weimar overtones, or the new disgust for political compromise.Anna Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Detroit: From Motor City to Housing Incubator", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "The 2008 financial crisis and 2013 city bankruptcy gutted Detroit\u2019s housing market. Now, Detroit is experimenting with unorthodox ways to get people to buy homes and renovate houses.Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, the country\u2019s two largest banks, trace their roots in Detroit back decades, when they helped finance the city\u2019s once-booming auto industry.These days, Detroit is still struggling to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, and the two banks have pledged to help resuscitate the city and its crippled housing market. So, guess how many home mortgage loans these two enormous banks made last year in this city of 637,000 people.Bank of America made 18. JPMorgan did just six.Detroit\u2019s hometown lender, Quicken Loans, made the most \u2014 170 mortgages.Midwestern cities like Detroit have long embodied the American can-do spirit. Over the course of a century, Motor City melded assembly-line prowess with freedom-of-the-road ideals to help define a nation. In the postwar years, Detroit became the epitome of the American dream, a place where factory workers without college degrees could make enough money to buy a house of their own.Yet as home prices soar across the United States \u2014 particularly on the coasts \u2014 Detroit remains a poster child for the economic crisis and housing collapse of a decade ago. Boarded up homes and rubble-strewn fields litter the landscape.Today, a house can be bought here for the price of a used Chevy Caprice.What is truly surprising about that, though, is how difficult it still is for buyers to actually buy. Basically, prices are too low for lenders (who see the deals as too small or risky) but too high for buyers (who may be cash-poor). There aren\u2019t enough houses in move-in-ready condition \u2014 and not enough money to fix them up.This strange situation has turned Detroit into an unlikely petri dish for experiments into how to kick-start a housing market that is, depending on your perspective, either slumbering or comatose.Will a neighborhood of \u201ctiny houses\u201d for the poor help fix things? Or how about rehabbing city-owned homes, and selling them at a loss, to jump-start the action? Other more conventional \u2014 if risky \u2014 ideas involve providing no-interest financing to fix up tumbledown properties. Or offering mortgages for homes that normally would be too small to be worth a banker\u2019s trouble.One local financier is even trying to beautify bulldozed neighborhoods by planting thousands of trees on 160 acres of vacant land his firm has gobbled up.And while Detroit is worse off than most big cities, housing-policy makers nationwide are keeping a close eye to see what lessons can be learned.To understand how far Detroit has fallen, consider the statistics. In the mid-2000s, banks were writing some 7,000 mortgages a year. Then, the financial crisis nearly destroyed the American automotive industry, Detroit\u2019s economic heart. Jobs disappeared; citizens fled. Last year, there were more than 700 mortgages made in Detroit, up from 200 at the depth of the crisis but barely 10 percent of the level a decade earlier.Those bleak numbers, however, do not tell the whole story. Behind the scenes, nonprofit groups, foundations, local officials and a dozen banks including JPMorgan, Bank of America and Quicken are trying to varying degrees to reanimate the mortgage market in Michigan\u2019s largest city.Success, however, often comes achingly slow.At 15455 Winthrop Street, on one of Detroit\u2019s better manicured blocks, there is a freshly rehabbed three-bedroom home. The bungalow-style house was fixed up by the city itself, through its land bank, which acquired the house a year ago after the county foreclosed on the owner for failing to pay taxes. The land bank did a gut renovation with money provided by a grant from Quicken.Since August, the land bank has been trying to sell the house, with a price tag of at least $79,900. More than 80 people have come to check it out. But so far there have been no takers.\u201cWe have never not sold one,\u201d said Craig Fahle, a former radio host who today is the communications director for the Detroit Land Bank Authority. \u201cDetroit likes to do everything kicking and screaming,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we get there eventually.\u201dEven happy stories are the product of a slog. Erica Wyatt struggled to pay down her debts and then searched for two years before she managed to get a mortgage from Fifth Third Bank to buy a four-bedroom home for $92,000. The transaction happened only because Ms. Wyatt, a single mother with four children, received $15,000 in down payment assistance.Ms. Wyatt, who grew up in Detroit, said she was determined to move back into the city after renting a home in a suburb. \u201cI wanted to make sure my children saw that not all of Detroit is bad and there are some beautiful neighborhoods,\u201d said Ms. Wyatt, 39, who works for an insurance company.The dollhouse-like structures \u2014 seven so far \u2014 are near the organization\u2019s main social services facility, in a rather desolate area of Detroit off Rosa Parks Boulevard. In all, Ms. Fowler hopes to build two dozen small homes, which will be rented for as little as $250 a month and eventually deeded over after seven years to a select group of homeless or poor individuals.Tiny-house living can take adjustment, even for people with no roof over their heads at all. Ms. Fowler said that one homeless veteran told her the homes were too small to compete with a traditional homeless shelter.Still, for some, the homes are perfect. One of the first tenants to move in this past summer is a former Methodist minister, David Leenhouts, who was forced to give up his ministry near Cleveland because of health issues that make it difficult for him to walk and talk.Mr. Leenhouts, who grew up in the Detroit area, said his college-age son told him the small home, with a steepled ceiling, was all he needed because everything is within just a few steps. Mr. Leenhouts, 59, said, \u201cI have no idea where I would be living if I was not chosen for a tiny house.\u201dThat said, a cluster of tiny homes hardly seems scalable in a city as big as Detroit. And almost by definition, a tiny home isn\u2019t a viable option for a family with children.It\u2019s also an example of why the long-term prognosis for Detroit\u2019s housing market remains uncertain at best. Much of the work underway is taking place block-by-block \u2014 much like the tiny-home homeless experiment \u2014 and there are a lot of blocks in this 139-square-mile city.\u201cThe pilot programs help some people, but they are on the margin,\u201d said Gregory Markus, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Michigan and executive director of Detroit Action Commonwealth, an advocacy group for low-income residents. \u201c\u2018The root problem is that Detroit is the poorest big city in America.\u201d\u2019The national poverty rate is 14 percent, and Detroit\u2019s is 36 percent. Mr. Markus said that, without more jobs, home buying will remain a largely unattainable goal.Detroit\u2019s population peaked in the 1950s at nearly 2 million and has been falling ever since. The financial crisis and the city\u2019s bankruptcy filing in 2013 hollowed out what was left of its once large, middle-class African-American community. Over the past decade there have been more than 150,000 home foreclosures here.Things are so difficult that simply finding a contractor to rehab a home can be an ordeal. \u201cWe had several contractors who didn\u2019t want to do work in the city,\u201d said Heather McKeon, 35, who along with her husband, Matthew, recently moved into a fixer-upper in Detroit\u2019s up-and-coming Corktown neighborhood. \u201cThey would say, \u2018I don\u2019t trust that I can keep my tools here.\u2019\u201dShe added: \u201cIt is still sort of flabbergasting to be laughed at.\u201dMs. McKeon, an interior designer, said many insurers wouldn\u2019t sell them a homeowner\u2019s policy on an unoccupied home under renovation. Ultimately, they got a policy from a subsidiary of Munich Re Group of Germany.Many of the efforts to resuscitate the housing market begin with the Detroit Land Bank Authority, a government agency that is the city\u2019s single largest property owner. The land bank owns some 25,000 vacant homes in various stages of disrepair, another 4,200 occupied homes and 65,000 grass-covered lots where homes once stood before the city tore them down in an effort to fight blight.Mr. Fahle, the land bank\u2019s communications director, likes to drive around and point out once-abandoned houses that his employer sold to people who then fixed them up.But on a rainy September day, he was particularly interested in showing off the refurbished three-bedroom house at 15455 Winthrop, which the land bank spent $98,000 to renovate. The asking price for the home \u2014 with its restored hardwood floors and a new granite kitchen countertop \u2014 was reduced by a few thousand dollars in early September from $83,000 to spur more interest.The program, though, is losing money \u2014 an average of $21,000 for every home sold.Mr. Fahle said the goal wasn\u2019t to turn a profit, but to get more move-in-ready homes into the marketplace and to boost property values in the process. In all, the land bank has sold more than 2,700 houses, many in online auctions.The land bank\u2019s operations are not without controversy. Housing advocates have complained it has focused too much attention on rehabbing homes in just a few neighborhoods, and on tearing down dilapidated homes elsewhere. A federal grand jury has been investigating the awarding of contracts to tear down more than 12,000 dilapidated homes as part of a war on blight led by Detroit\u2019s first-term mayor, Mike Duggan. The investigation is looking into why costs soared under the demolition program, with almost $140 million in mostly federal money being spent.Mr. Fahle said the land bank is cooperating with the investigation. He said criticism that the rehabbed and ready program has focused on a just a small part of the city is misguided. Mr. Fahle said a decision was made to select homes for renovation in four neighborhoods early on, but over time it is expanding to other parts of the city.Homes are certainly worth more in Detroit now than they were a few years ago. Citywide, the median value for a house here is $47,700, a 40 percent gain over the past two years, according to Zillow. Stately homes in the Villages, a group of neighborhoods with tree-lined streets, located not far from the posh suburb of Grosse Pointe, Mich., have sold for more than $400,000.But progress is largely limited to a small cluster of neighborhoods. About half of the mortgages written in Detroit last year were for homes purchased in just six ZIP codes, according to data from the real estate information firm RealtyTrac, part of Attom Data Solutions. There are 25 ZIP codes in Detroit.One question is whether the money that banks are providing \u2014 a combination of grants and loans \u2014 signifies a long-term commitment or an effort to score points with federal regulators. Banks are expected under the federal Community Reinvestment Act to make loans in communities with large numbers of poor- or moderate-income residents in order to spur economic activity.The downpayment-assistance program that helped Ms. Wyatt buy her home, for instance, was financed by a settlement Wells Fargo reached a few years ago in a housing class-action lawsuit. The settlement money is drying up, though, and the bank said it was not sure if it will renew the program. So far, it has provided assistance to 180 home buyers in the city.Bank of America said it was committed to working in Detroit and is providing up to $4 million to fund no-interest loans that have enabled 400 homeowners to fix up properties. The bank, working with two nonprofit groups, also has said it was willing to finance $55 million worth of mortgages in Detroit. So far this year, the bank has issued 23 mortgages in Detroit \u2014 up from 18 in 2016 \u2014 and has increased the number of loan officers in the city.JPMorgan said it, too, was here for the long haul. Jamie Dimon, the bank\u2019s chairman and chief executive, regularly promotes its Invested in Detroit program, which includes up to $150 million for housing and commercial development and funds for research by the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., to study ways to revive Detroit\u2019s economy and housing market.Quicken, which moved most of its operations in 2010 to downtown Detroit from nearby Livonia, Mich., recently committed $300,000 to a new government program that will give 80 tenants living in homes that face tax foreclosure a chance to buy the houses for as little as $2,500.The mayoral election on Nov. 7 is to some degree a referendum on Mr. Duggan\u2019s efforts at reviving both downtown and the city\u2019s housing market. Mr. Duggan is seeking a second term and is opposed by Senator Coleman Young II. Mr. Duggan said one of his top priorities as mayor was getting home prices up in Detroit.\u201cHome-sale prices have climbed far faster than anyone could have predicted,\u201d Mr. Duggan said.Perhaps the most vexing issue is the reluctance of banks to give loans to people to buy cheap homes. It\u2019s simple business: The costs of underwriting a $50,000 mortgage \u2014 doing all the paperwork, the credit checks and the inspections \u2014 are the same as for much larger mortgages that can generate more bank revenue. Plus, when homes are in such disrepair, often they are appraised for much less than the amount the borrower needs to fix it up.That means the collateral on the loan \u2014 the house itself \u2014 is worth less than the amount the bank is owed. In today\u2019s risk-averse banking culture, that\u2019s a big no-no.\u201cDHM wants to be an ambassador for lending in the city,\u201d said Alex DeCamp, the mortgage community development manager for Chemical Bank, a local lender that has funded 15 loans through the program. The program can take months to complete. Applicants go through a careful screening and most also complete three mortgage workshops to be eligible for a loan.So far, 54 home buyers have bought homes through the program, among them Ms. McKeon and her husband. So did Ashley and Damon Dickerson, who are about to move into a renovated two-family home.The Dickersons, both of whom are architectural designers, closed in March. But their search began months earlier when they submitted a $45,000 bid during one of the land bank\u2019s daily online property auctions.Winning the bidding for the 107-year-old home was just the start. The couple found it would cost at least $180,000 to fully renovate the six-bedroom, three-story brick structure with a large porch. They were attracted to the home\u2019s hardwood floors, bay windows and potential to reshape it by knocking down some walls.The Detroit Home Mortgage project is now looking to get banks to provide low-interest loans directly to local contractors, so they can renovate more homes and get them into move-in-ready condition.But for now, the lack of move-in ready homes means home buyers like the Dickersons and the McKeons need to be something of urban pioneers \u2014 fixing everything from broken water lines to antiquated electrical wiring.The prospect of people moving into Detroit from the suburbs or city residents getting mortgages is of course sweet music to local real estate agents. Until now, much of the business for them has been handling all-cash deals. But several said they are looking forward to getting local residents into homes with traditional financing.Dorian Harvey, a Detroit native and the incoming president of the Detroit Association of Realtors, said he would like for the city and land bank to move quicker to get vacant homes into the hands of local residents. Mr. Harvey, a Morehouse College graduate, said he came from the camp that the rebirth of Detroit is going to have to happen from the ground up with everyone taking part \u2014 contractors, real estate agents and local investors.But he isn\u2019t necessarily waiting on government largess. \u201cThere are untapped resources in the city and we need to tap them and the city needs to tap them,\u201d said Mr. Harvey, who added there\u2019s money to made in Detroit. \u201cMy heart is liberal but my money is conservative.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of mortgages written for housing purchases in Detroit last year by Quicken Loans. It was 170, not 90.Follow me on twitter @mattgoldstein26Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Construction Booms, Philadelphia Seeks to Preserve Its Past", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetPHILADELPHIA \u2014 At 40th and Chestnut Streets on the west side of this city, a block of six red brick Victorian rowhouses is interrupted by an incongruous stretch of new student housing with gray walls and beige metal window frames.The units were built over the last two years on land that was made available by the demolition of two historic houses, among the latest casualties of Philadelphia\u2019s boom in commercial real estate.As demand for commercial property surges with a strengthening downtown economy, preservationists and the city authorities are searching for ways to defend the fabric of this historic city from the wrecker\u2019s ball.The measures, though in their early stages, offer hope to Philadelphia\u2019s preservationists, who struggled for years to defend historic buildings from the decay that resulted from a stagnating economy and are now trying to counteract a threat to older buildings from a suddenly vigorous property market.But their hopes, like those in other cities, have been jolted by the proposed elimination of the federal historic building tax credit that has underpinned many reuse projects. The credit allows owners of income-producing historic properties to deduct 20 percent of renovation costs from taxable income. Losing that credit, as proposed in the Republican tax bill introduced in the House on Nov. 2, would be a major setback to building preservation throughout the country, advocates say. The Senate\u2019s tax bill, released last week, would cut the tax deduction to 10 percent.According to the National Trust, the credit enabled the rehabilitation of more than 300 historic buildings in Philadelphia from 2002 to 2016. Nationwide, 1,039 historic buildings were repurposed with $1.2 billion in tax credits during the 2016 fiscal year, a 20 percent increase over the previous year. The organization \u2014 which is operating similar programs in Detroit, Louisville, Ky., and Miami\u2019s Little Havana neighborhood \u2014 argues that historic buildings nurture economic and social benefits.In Philadelphia, losing the tax credit could have a devastating effect on efforts to defend the historic building stock, said Harris Steinberg, executive director of Drexel University\u2019s Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation and chairman of the new preservation task force. \u201cIt very well could lead to more demolition of unprotected historic fabric,\u201d he said.According to the National Trust, almost 70 percent of Philadelphia\u2019s buildings date from 1945 or earlier, but the city has so far given historic designation to only 2.2 percent of the total, about half the national average. Advocates attribute the low protection rate to the long-term underfunding of the Historical Commission, which has had only five staff members for the last 30 years, leaving it unable to evaluate many historic designation proposals that preservationists nominate.But two more members will join the staff in coming weeks, enabling the commission to address a backlog in historic designations, said the commission\u2019s executive director, Jon Farnham.\u201cI would imagine that we will be designating more than double the number that we designated this year or last year once we get these new staff members,\u201d Mr. Farnham said. He said the new staff would allow the commission to resume the historic designation process for whole districts, in addition to individual properties.Additional protection would help to counter a threat from surging development. Seventeen major construction projects, worth a total investment of $808 million, were completed in downtown Philadelphia by the end of 2016, according to Center City District, an economic development organization. An additional 42 projects, including residential, office and retail space, were under construction at a total investment of $5.4 billion by the end of last year, while 22 more, totaling $3.3 billion, have been proposed.Underpinning the jump in construction is a 19 percent increase in the downtown population since 2000, Center City District said, driven by an increase in job opportunities and cultural offerings downtown.The resulting demand for space is putting pressure on older properties like the demolished Chestnut Street rowhouses, which were built in the early 1870s and were functioning apartment buildings in good condition, said Paul Steinke, executive director of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia, a nonprofit organization that advocates the protection of historic buildings.With the expected influx of residents and shoppers from developments like Lincoln Square, the factory, which has been empty since 2006, could be more attractive to a developer for new construction than for adaptive reuse such as apartments, Mr. Steinke said.Preservationists have also been galvanized by plans by Toll Brothers City Living to demolish five buildings on Jewelers Row, a historic downtown hub for artisans and retailers of diamonds and other gems, to make way for a condominium tower.Adaptive reuse has had notable successes, Mr. Steinke said. He cited the Divine Lorraine Hotel, an abandoned 1894 apartment building that was a notorious \u201cbillboard of blight\u201d for years until the recent construction of 109 apartments and 20,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and restaurant space on a formerly shabby stretch of North Broad Street.But demolition and new construction is usually more financially compelling to developers, said Ken Weinstein, president of PhillyOfficeRetail, a developer that renovates vacant commercial and mixed-used properties.\u201cThe numbers right now point to making more money if you\u2019re willing to demolish and build from scratch, particularly in the hot neighborhoods,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said.For that reason, the city would have to provide incentives such as more permissive zoning or give developers the first opportunity to buy city-owned properties if it decides to require more adaptive reuse, Mr. Weinstein said. Without concessions from the city, there would be \u201ca lot of pushback\u201d from developers, especially if the federal historic building tax credit was eliminated, he said.How or whether the city can protect more of its historic buildings will be examined by the mayor\u2019s 29-member task force over the next year, said Mr. Steinberg, who is expected to release the panel\u2019s first report on Thursday.The task force might end up recommending changes to the city\u2019s 1985 historic protection ordinance, suggesting financial incentives for developers to preserve buildings or proposing a tiered system of historic designation, Mr. Steinberg said.\u201cOur job is not to advocate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s to really be informed policymakers around the larger goal of balancing preservation and growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Targeting China\u2019s Purchases, Congress Proposes Tougher Reviews of Foreign Investments", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 China has been a tricky economic partner for the United States, offering both lucrative opportunities for collaboration and a minefield of security risks.The dual approach highlights the challenge facing the Trump administration as it tries to articulate a clear strategy for dealing with China. Mr. Trump campaigned on a get-tough approach to China \u2014 a view that is shared by many Republican and Democratic lawmakers who see the country as a growing threat \u2014 but he must now balance that position with preserving the business ties that much of the United States economy depends on.On Wednesday, Senator John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, introduced legislation that could add thousands of companies with foreign ties to the list of those reviewed each year by Cfius and provide more funding to deal with that increase. A similar House bill was also introduced on Wednesday by Representative Robert Pittenger, a Republican from North Carolina.Chinese investment in the United States and elsewhere has surged in recent years as the Chinese government encouraged companies to acquire technology and know-how abroad, and as Chinese companies and wealthy individuals sought safer refuges for their money.In the United States, Chinese investment tripled from the previous year to reach $46 billion in 2016, according to the Rhodium Group, a research firm. This year, tighter Chinese controls on outbound capital appear to have cut that figure sharply.\u201cThey are looking at a lot more deals than they have traditionally, and a lot more politically sensitive deals,\u201d said Thad McBride, the chairman of the international trade group at the law firm Bass, Berry and Sims.That would only increase under the legislation introduced on Wednesday, which would expand reviews from focusing strictly on mergers and acquisitions to include joint ventures. Lawmakers said some Chinese companies had been bypassing the Cfius review by forming joint ventures with American companies or licensing their technology. The legislation would seek to close that loophole by requiring an automatic review of joint ventures that exceeded a certain threshold of foreign ownership and expand scrutiny of certain emerging technologies that could give countries like China an edge over the United States.\u201cThis bill takes a measured approach by providing long overdue reforms to better protect our country, while also working to ensure that beneficial foreign investment is not chilled,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said.China has already objected to reviews of its acquisitions, describing them as protectionism in disguise. Chinese companies have tried to highlight how their investments create jobs and support economic growth in the United States, and thus dovetail with the president\u2019s goals \u2014 including the administration\u2019s primary rationale for tax reform.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the chairman of the multiagency Cfius panel, said last month that the Trump administration was \u201cworking very proactively with the House and the Senate on areas where we think there could be legislative improvements.\u201d\u201cI would expect there will be a lot of bipartisan support for that,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin added.He said there was a clear need for reform that would prevent companies from doing \u201cthings indirectly that they\u2019re not allowed to do directly.\u201dIn the United States, companies are freely allowed to sell their assets to the highest bidder, unless the acquisition could pose a security threat. But some proposals to reform the Cfius process have called for expanding that criterion as well.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, proposed a plan in August that would have created an additional review mechanism to consider whether investments, mergers and acquisitions were economically harmful to the United States, either by costing jobs or the loss of technology to competitors.Lawyers and investment bankers say that the shadow of Cfius is looming larger than ever over corporate transactions. In Singapore, for example, officials with the government\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Temasek, say they perceive Cfius as increasingly looking at deals through the lens of what their long-term effect could be on the American economy and companies, rather than through a strictly national security prism.But the review process is especially daunting for Chinese companies. Ya-Qin Zhang, the president of Baidu, the giant Chinese internet company, said at a Silicon Valley deal-making conference in October that his company was looking to do more deals in the United States but \u201chas to be careful\u201d because of Cfius and the political climate.\u201cThe scrutiny that Cfius and Congress is now having on Chinese deals\u201d is probably at its highest level ever, Jerry Yang, the Yahoo co-founder, said at the Silicon Valley conference in October.Mr. Yang described the process of government authorities in the United States and China reviewing deals as \u201cthe invisible hand of the government \u2014 or maybe it isn\u2019t so invisible,\u201d he said.David Enrich and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tells Japan It Can Protect Itself by Buying U.S. Arms", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 President Trump said on Monday that Japan could protect itself from a nuclear-armed North Korea by buying billions of dollars of American military equipment, drawing an explicit link between trade and security as he began a complex, politically charged tour of Asia.\u201cHe will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said, standing alongside Mr. Abe at the Akasaka Palace in Tokyo. \u201cThe prime minister of Japan is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan,\u201d the president added.Mr. Trump steered clear of the inflammatory statements about North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong-un, that he has used in the past. But he defended his use of such confrontational language, suggesting that the reluctance of his predecessors to make such statements had emboldened Mr. Kim.\u201cSome people said that my rhetoric is very strong, but look what\u2019s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cLook where we are right now.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s remarks came on a day of high pomp and plain-spoken politics, which showcased both the president\u2019s fitful adjustment to the rituals of statecraft and his determination to keeping pounding at the hot-button issues that vaulted him into the White House.Before midday, Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko welcomed Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, at the Imperial residence. Afterward, the president was formally received by Mr. Abe on a red carpet at Akasaka Palace, a neo-Baroque building that resembles Buckingham Palace. The two men inspected an honor guard, glittering in gold braid, their rifles fixed with bayonets.Earlier, however, Mr. Trump used a breakfast meeting of Japanese and American business executives to deliver a scathing critique of the trade relationship between the two countries. Japan, he said, bought virtually no cars from the United States while exporting millions of vehicles into the American market.\u201cTry building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over,\u201d Mr. Trump said, disregarding the fact that Japanese carmakers have built huge assembly plants in the United States. \u201cThat\u2019s not too much to ask,\u201d he continued. \u201cIs that rude to ask?\u201dIn somewhat gentler terms, Mr. Trump told Mr. Abe that the United States was seeking a new kind of trade relationship. Though he praised the Japanese economy, the president added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s as good as ours. I think not, O.K.?\u201d he said, shooting Mr. Abe a gimlet-eyed glance. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to try to keep it that way, and you\u2019ll be second.\u201dWhether by design or otherwise, Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly rejected the idea of direct negotiations with North Korea over curbing its nuclear program, seemed to suggest his stance could change if Mr. Kim returned the Japanese people his regime had abducted. North Korea has acknowledged only some abductions, releasing five people in 2002 and saying the rest died long ago.\u201cNow the spotlight is on, and perhaps we could have some very good luck, and perhaps the regime itself would send them back,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong-un would send them back. If he would send them back that would be the start of something \u2014 I think it would be just something very special if they would do that.\u201dMr. Abe, for his part, played to his guest\u2019s appetite for ceremony \u2014 and spontaneity. As the two leaders strolled to lunch in a private dining room overlooking a koi pond, they were each given a wooden box of fish food and a spoon. After a few moments of delicately spooning the flakes into the pond, a restless Mr. Abe tossed in the remains of his box, leading Mr. Trump to dump his, too.Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe then took seats at a long, low table on a floor covered with straw tatami mats. At the news conference, the prime minister referred repeatedly to Mr. Trump by his first name, Donald, recounting their meetings at Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s Florida estate, and a dinner here on Sunday so enjoyable that he said they lost track of time.\u201cHow many hours of dialogue have we had?\u201d Mr. Abe asked. \u201cI believe there have been never been such close bonds.\u201dMr. Abe reacted mildly to reports in the Japanese media \u2014 which Mr. Trump implicitly confirmed during the news conference \u2014 that Mr. Trump was dismayed by Japan\u2019s decision not to shoot down missiles North Korea fired over Japanese territory in August and September. The missiles flew over the island of Hokkaido before landing harmlessly in the sea.In conversations with other Asian leaders, a senior American official said, Mr. Trump asked why a country of \u201csamurai warriors\u201d did not shoot down the missiles, which the North Koreans launched in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions.Mr. Trump did not directly address the issue on Monday, though he noted that over the weekend an American antimissile system had shot down a missile fired on Saudi Arabia by Houthi rebels in Yemen.Japan had tracked the missiles North Korea fired over Japan, Mr. Abe said, and would have shot them down if they had posed a threat to Japanese citizens.Japan\u2019s American-made missile defense systems would have enabled the country to shoot down the missile that flew over Hokkaido on Aug. 29, though not a subsequent one tested on Sept. 15. It is also possible Japan could have missed if it tried to shoot the missiles down, which would have been an acute embarrassment.Legally, the question is even more complicated. Japan can intercept a missile only if its citizens are in danger or if there is an attack on an allied country that could jeopardize Japan\u2019s security, said Noboru Yamaguchi, professor of international relations at the International University of Japan in Niigata.Since North Korea has so far only conducted missile tests \u2014 as opposed to launching missiles armed with live warheads \u2014 Japan does not have the legal right to intercept them. Moreover, said Mr. Yamaguchi, who is a retired lieutenant general in Japan\u2019s military, known as the Self-Defense Forces, the prime minister would need approval from Japan\u2019s Parliament for any such action.Mr. Yamaguchi dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s reference to samurai warriors as a caricature. \u201cSamurais are quiet up until the last moment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the last moment, samurais do things decisively.\u201dAt a dinner at the Akasaka Palace on Monday night, Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe showered praise on each other, reminiscing about how the Japanese prime minister was an early visitor to the newly elected American president before he took office.Mr. Trump laid responsibility for the episode squarely on Mr. Abe, saying in his toast that he tried to prevent the visit after aides said it would be inappropriate to meet with a foreign leader before the inauguration, but Mr. Abe was already on his way to New York.\u201cI said, \u2018There\u2019s no way he lands and I don\u2019t see him,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Abe. \u201cI saw him, and it worked out just fine.\u201dMotoko Rich contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He has his share of critics, who mock him as egoistical and erratic, and for fanning the war flames with North Korea. But he also has many ardent supporters, which is perhaps a surprising development for the leader of China\u2019s biggest geopolitical rival.They refer to him as \u201cUncle Trump,\u201d \u201cGrand Commander\u201d and \u201cDonald the Strong.\u201d After Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to the Forbidden City on Wednesday with President Xi Jinping, one fan wrote on social media, \u201cLong live Emperor Trump!\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s Chinese fans praise his irrepressible style, his skill as an entertainer and his willingness to say what he thinks. Many also like the fact that he seems less inhibited than previous American presidents about recognizing China as a superpower and as an equal on the global stage.And after years of American presidents lecturing China on issues like political prisoners and democracy, many also say they are relieved to see a leader who seems to care more about making deals than idealism.They say Mr. Trump has changed the tone of America\u2019s conversation with China.\u201cPeople are sort of tired of listening to that criticism,\u201d said Xu Qinduo, a political commentator for China Radio International in Beijing. \u201cNow we can talk to each other.\u201dIt helps that the government-run news media has encouraged a positive portrayal of Mr. Trump, focusing on his warm relationship with Mr. Xi and his praise for China. Even those who do know about Mr. Trump\u2019s troubles at home, including the investigation into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, say these don\u2019t detract from his admirable qualities.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in the Russian investigation or his North Korea strategy,\u201d said Zhang Changjiang, 43, an instructor at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. \u201cHis purpose is clear. He knows how to whet people\u2019s appetite, how to make a scene and how to leverage his abilities.\u201dFor many Chinese, Mr. Trump is a familiar type: the celebrity businessman. Successful, outspoken tycoons can win godlike status in China\u2019s get-rich society, and Mr. Trump is no exception. His books, including \u201cTrump Never Give Up,\u201d received glowing reviews on Chinese websites. He is presented as a role model, a billionaire with his own empire of golf courses and gilded hotels.Some believe his boardroom acumen will help him strike trade deals that will also benefit China\u2019s economy.\u201cAs a successful businessman, Trump definitely won\u2019t ignore the huge size of China\u2019s consumer base,\u201d said Li Yang, 25, a designer.\u201cTrump is a person of ambiguity,\u201d said Sun Caihong, 38, a resident of Beijing. \u201cHis policy is not clear.

Stanley Rosen, a political science professor at the University of Southern California, said that the Chinese respect unpredictable, confident personalities, which in their own history would include figures like modern China\u2019s founding father, Mao Zedong.Mr. Trump is showing that he is spontaneous and \u201cbeholden to no one,\u201d Mr. Rosen said.Mr. Trump\u2019s celebrity status also adds to his mystique. Before his election, he was already known in China as the star of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d which could be viewed online.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump showed Mr. Xi another video of his granddaughter singing in Chinese, which was shared widely after it was posted online, attracting tens of millions of views in less than 24 hours.Other Chinese take a more hard-nosed approach, embracing Mr. Trump because of the advantages that they see him offering to China. They regard an American retreat from global affairs as an opening for Beijing to extend its influence. They also say Mr. Trump has helped enhance China\u2019s stature by treating Mr. Xi as an equal partner.\u201cTrump is the first American president to do so,\u201d said the editorial, which appeared on Thursday.

{"Headline": "Real Estate Agents Mobilize to Shield Homeowners on Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, the real estate industry has benefited from generous tax deductions that raise home values by making it cheaper for people to own property and shoulder their local taxes. Now, as the Republican tax plan makes its way through Congress, the industry is worried that the fallout will harm its business by making homeownership less valuable.Last week, Ms. Jay and other agents congregated in front of the local office of Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, holding signs and chanting, \u201cSave homeownership.\u201d\u201cWe know he has a tough job to do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we certainly are not going to shy away from letting him know what our feelings are.\u201dAccording to some economists, real estate agents have plenty to fear. The Senate version of the tax bill would eliminate the deduction for local property taxes (the House bill caps it at $10,000), and both the House and Senate bills would effectively make the mortgage-interest deduction less valuable to many homeowners. Both provisions could raise the cost of owning a home, making homeownership less attractive for at least some families \u2014 and perhaps depressing property values.Like just about every aspect of the tax plan, these measures would fall hardest on people who lived in high-cost, high-tax areas. According to an analysis of the plans by Moody\u2019s Analytics, the nation\u2019s most expensive real estate markets could see significant declines in home values under both versions of the tax plan.\u201cThere really are big winners and losers here,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cIf you live in New York or New Jersey, you\u2019re going to get crushed. If you\u2019re in West Texas or Nebraska, no big deal, and you may even benefit.\u201dIn New York and New Jersey, which have expensive homes and high property taxes, home values could fall as much as 14 percent by 2019 under the Senate plan, according to the Moody\u2019s analysis. The suburbs around Chicago, Cleveland and Philadelphia are also near the top of the list.Those figures are estimates, so should be viewed with some degree of skepticism. Still, they reflect a fundamental truth: The tax code subsidizes homeownership, and that has raised the value of homes. All else being equal, removing those tax breaks should reduce home prices.Some economists are skeptical that the tax bills would have a major impact on the housing market. Matthew Pointon, a housing economist at Capital Economics in New York, said the bills could lead some well-to-do families to buy somewhat smaller homes than they otherwise would. But he noted that most households already chose not to itemize their deductions, and so didn\u2019t benefit directly from the housing-oriented tax breaks that the bill would eliminate.And to the extent that the bills would cut taxes for most families, Mr. Pointon said, that could stimulate the housing market by giving prospective home buyers more money to spend.Vishwanath Tirupattur, United States housing strategist for Morgan Stanley, said the bills would most likely have a modest negative impact on both home prices and sales activity. He said other forces, including rising demand for housing among millennials and a limited supply of single-family homes, should help counterbalance the effects of the bills.Neither the House nor the Senate tax bill would repeal the tax code\u2019s biggest gift to homeowners, the deductibility of interest for most mortgages. But they would make that deduction less valuable.Both bills would roughly double the standard deduction, which would lead fewer households to itemize their deductions; households that take the standard deduction don\u2019t directly benefit from the mortgage-interest deduction, which reduces the value of owning a home. The House bill would also cap the amount of mortgage debt eligible for the deduction at $500,000; the Senate bill would leave the cap at its present level of $1 million.The tax plans could also hurt the housing market in a less direct way. Most independent analyses estimate the bills could add $1 trillion or more to the federal deficit at a time when unemployment is low and the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates. With more demand in the debt market, standard economic theory suggests that mortgage rates would increase faster than they would have absent a higher deficit, raising the cost of financing a home.Economists, including Mr. Zandi, have never been particularly fond of the various tax subsidies for homeownership. They favor homeowners over renters and distort the housing market and even migration patterns by encouraging people to buy bigger homes in higher-tax suburbs.But now that those tax breaks are baked into the system, homeowners have come to count on them and in some cases could end up \u201cunderwater\u201d \u2014 that is, their home would be worth less than their mortgage \u2014 if their deductions were abruptly ripped away. Mr. Zandi said he favored some kind of phase-in period so that markets could adjust more gradually.\u201cIn some of these communities, it could be really damaging to the economy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Plan Delivers Permanent Corporate Tax Cut", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican lawmakers unveiled a sweeping rewrite of the tax code on Thursday, outlining a $1.5 trillion plan that will deliver a significant tax cut for corporations and more modest savings for middle-class families while tilting the United States closer, but not entirely, toward the kind of tax system long championed by businesses.The House plan, released after weeks of internal debate, conflict and delay, immediately ignited a legislative and lobbying fight as business groups, special interests and Democrats began tearing into the text ahead of a Republican sprint to get the legislation passed and to President Trump\u2019s desk by Christmas. Lawmakers appeared unfazed by the blowback and scheduled the first official \u201cmarkup\u201d of the bill for Monday.\u201cWith this plan, we are making pro-growth reforms, so that yes, America can compete with the rest of the world,\u201d said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.The bill is heavily weighted toward business, which would receive about $1 trillion in net cuts, or two-thirds of the total, according to calculations by the Joint Committee on Taxation. At its center is a proposal to permanently cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent \u2014 a change that is estimated to reduce federal revenues by $1.5 trillion over the next decade alone.For individuals, the plan establishes three tax brackets \u2014 12, 25 and 35 percent \u2014 instead of the seven that exist now and maintains a top rate of 39.6 percent for millionaires. The bill would also eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which is expected to hit 4.5 million families in 2017, and would roughly double the standard deduction for middle-class families. It would not, as many had feared, make any changes to the pretax treatment of 401(k) plans.Americans will still be able to make \u201cboth traditional, pretax contributions and \u2018Roth\u2019 contributions in the way that works best for them,\u201d Republican lawmakers said in their talking points.The bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.But the legislation includes several land mines that could complicate its passage, including limits on the popular mortgage interest deduction and caps on the state and local tax deduction, as well as its overall cost. Several Republicans from the high-tax states of New York and New Jersey said the bill would need to change to gain their support, while powerful trade groups representing the real estate industry and small businesses blasted the bill as ineffective and harmful to Americans.\u201cContrary to their assertions, the Republicans are picking winners and losers,\u201d Jerry Howard, the chief executive of the National Association of Homebuilders, said in an interview. \u201cThey are picking rich Americans and corporations over small businesses and the middle class.\u201dMeanwhile, Senate Republicans are working on their own tax bill, and on Thursday, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, lobbed a grenade into the House plan over its cost.\u201cAs I have made clear from the beginning of this debate, it is my hope that the final legislation \u2014 while allowing for current policy assumptions and reasonable dynamic scoring \u2014 will not add to the deficit, sets rates that are permanent in nature and closes a minimum of $4 trillion in loopholes and special interest deductions,\u201d Mr. Corker said.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that the House plan had the \u201cfull support\u201d of Mr. Trump and predicted that it would be on the president\u2019s desk this year. Anticipating the resistance from industry groups, Mr. Brady said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to prove them wrong once and for all.\u201dRepresentative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said he was bracing for the lobbyist onslaught but would not be deterred.\u201cWe\u2019ve just finished the opening ceremonies of the lobbyist Olympics. My phone has all kinds of messages and there are all kinds of criticisms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe notion of just defending the status quo is insufferable, and we\u2019re not going to do it.\u201dThe House Republicans on Thursday released policy highlights ahead of the rollout of their tax plan.The bill is estimated to cost $1.5 trillion over a decade, and lawmakers must keep it at that amount if they are to pass it along party lines and avoid a filibuster by Democrats. Lawmakers have been scrambling for days to find revenue to offset tax cuts that will cost trillions of dollars. That has prompted a host of changes on the individual side, including repealing tax breaks for things like medical expenses, moving expenses, student loan interest and adoption, as well as making some business tax breaks temporary.The benefits for individual taxpayers will be mixed and depend largely on where they fall on the income scale, where they live and the types of tax breaks they tend to claim.Those making up to $24,000 will pay no income tax. For married taxpayers filing jointly, earnings up to $90,000 would be taxed in the 12 percent bracket; earnings up to $260,000 would fall in the 25 percent bracket; and earnings up to $1 million would be taxed at the 35 percent rate. For unmarried individuals and those filing separately, the bracket thresholds would be half of these amounts, other than the 35 percent bracket, which would be $200,000 for unmarried individuals.The proposal roughly doubles the standard deduction for middle-class families, expanding it to $24,000 for married couples, from $12,700, and setting it at $12,000 for individuals, from $6,530 today. Republicans also plan to expand the child tax credit to $1,600 from $1,000 and add a $300 credit for each parent and nonchild dependent, such as older family members, though that credit would expire after five years.But it also tightens rules for claiming the child tax credit, a change that would hit immigrant parents whose children were born in the United States. Filers would need to provide a \u201cwork-eligible Social Security number\u201d rather than just a taxpayer identification number in order to claim the credit. The left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities said the bill would roll back eligibility for about three million children in working families, including about 80 percent of whom were born in the United States.The bill includes a host of other changes that will affect taxpayers in different ways. For instance, it repeals certain tax credits, including a 15 percent credit for individuals aged 65 or over or who are retired on disability. Right now, those individuals can claim up to $7,500 for a joint return, $5,000 for a single individual, or $3,750 for a married individual filing a joint return.The House bill would entirely repeal that tax credit. It would also repeal the adoption tax credit, no longer allow deductions for tax preparation and repeal credits for alimony payments. And deductions for moving expenses would no longer be allowed.One of the biggest flash points is a proposed change to the popular mortgage interest deduction. Under the Republican plan, existing homeowners can keep the deduction, but future purchases will be capped at $500,000, down from the current $1 million limit.The National Association of Realtors came out swinging against the bill, suggesting a huge fight awaits over how real estate is treated.\u201cEliminating or nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and middle-class homeowners at risk, and from a cursory examination this legislation appears to do just that,\u201d said William E. Brown, the president of the association. \u201cWe will have additional details upon a more thorough reading of the bill.\u201dMr. Howard of the homebuilders group said the bill was a broken promise.\u201cIt puts such severe limitations on homebuyers\u2019 ability to use the mortgage interest deduction that home values will fall,\u201d he said.Another area of contention is the bill\u2019s treatment of the state and local tax deduction, which is popular among many middle- and upper-middle-class taxpayers in high-cost states like New Jersey, New York and California. The House bill would limit the deduction to just property taxes, rather than state and local income taxes and general sales taxes, and cap the benefit at $10,000.Several Republican lawmakers said they would oppose the bill in its current form, including Representatives Leonard Lance and Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey.The proposal will double the estate tax exemption to roughly $11 million, from $5.49 million, meaning families can avoid paying taxes on large inheritance. And it eventually repeals the estate tax altogether, phasing it out entirely in six years.House Republicans on Thursday released their plan for the most sweeping rewrite of the tax code in decades.Business groups that include large multinationals praised the bill effusively for lowering corporate rates permanently and sharply, and for overhauling the international tax system.For the first time, the United States is proposing to effectively levy a global minimum tax of 10 percent, which would apply to income that high-profit subsidiaries of American companies earn anywhere in the world. The effort is aimed at preventing companies from shifting profits abroad and grabbing back some of the tax revenue on income earned overseas. Those profits are currently not taxed until they are returned to the United States, giving companies an incentive to keep that money offshore since they are taxed at the current corporate tax rate of 35 percent.The White House has said more than $2.5 trillion in American profits are held offshore.The bill would force companies to pay a one-time 12 percent tax on liquid assets held overseas, like cash. The tax, which is reduced from the current 35 percent tax rate, would be payable over eight years. For illiquid assets, like equipment or property, the tax rate would be 5 percent.It would also force American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies to pay a 20 percent excise tax on any payments sent back to foreign affiliates.Neil Bradley, the chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called the bill a \u201chome run\u201d for economic growth and warned other groups against blocking it. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to look at this and find something they don\u2019t like,\u201d Mr. Bradley said. \u201cSo they are going to have to decide? Am I going to help get this done?\u201dAmong those less sanguine about the bill are small businesses, which said the bill does not go far enough to help them reduce their tax burden. Republicans stuck to their promise of lowering the tax rate for \u201cpass through\u201d businesses to 25 percent. But to prevent the rate from becoming a loophole for all sorts of individuals, tax writers have created a formula they say will ensure that business owners will pay a higher individual tax rate on income that they receive as wages. The formula would be applied based on the circumstances of the business.That provision is not enough to satisfy the National Federation of Independent Business, which said in a statement it is \u201cunable to support the House tax reform plan in its current form.\u201dPlacing even more pressure on lawmakers, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation is planning to spend $6 million on a nationwide ad campaign, including a TV commercial, that warns against a tax plan that adds to the national debt.The message of the campaign is that overhauling the tax code \u201cshould grow the economy, not the debt,\u201d said Michael A. Peterson, the president and chief executive of the foundation, which advocates reining in federal budget deficits.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can the Singapore Model Save Zimbabwe?", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEmmerson Mnangagwa, the new president of Zimbabwe, will have a hard time digging his country out of the economic hole that it fell into during the 37 years it was led by Robert Mugabe. But it can be done.During Mr. Mugabe\u2019s reign, all economic activity was dependent on political decisions, which enhanced the prizes of political power and the stakes in the fight for it. State-owned enterprises, capital controls, price controls, import controls, one-time mining fees and a plethora of regulations wrapped Zimbabwe in a giant ball of red tape and destroyed the economy.Zimbabwe\u2019s economic decline has been punctuated by several notable events and episodes. One of these was the Fast-Track Land Reform Program of 2000, under which land was seized from white farmers.This confiscation had been happening since 1980, but under this program, the farms were taken without compensation. Zimbabwe\u2019s Supreme Court declared the program unconstitutional, but Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government ignored that ruling.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government then instituted a system in which the United States dollar became the coin of the realm. Government accounts became denominated in United States dollars in 2009. As a result of this dollarization and the installation of a national unity government in 2009, the economy rebounded.The end of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s rule raises the question: What is next for the economy? Zimbabwe could adopt the strategy of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u2019s first prime minister. That strategy was based on four principles: stable money, no foreign aid, first-world competitiveness and the protection of private property and the public\u2019s safety. With Mr. Lee\u2019s near perfect execution of the strategy, Singapore escaped its grinding poverty of 1965 to become one of the world\u2019s most affluent countries.Mr.Mnangagwa does not remind one of Mr. Lee. Indeed, he was a pillar of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s regime. Unlike the impoverished populace, Mr. Mnangagwa and his supporters in the military and party have done well under Mr. Mugabe\u2019s system of spoils.But the people are fed up with their poverty. Mr. Mnangagwa claims to be listening, even declaring that the \u201cvoice of the people is the voice of God.\u201dTo deliver, Mr. Mnangagwa must prohibit the issuance of New Zim dollars. The dollarization rules followed by the unity government should be restored. Mr. Mnangagwa should also announce that private enterprise is Zimbabwe\u2019s future.The World Bank has found that there is a strong positive relationship between a country\u2019s prosperity and how easy it is to do business there. At present, Zimbabwe ranks 159 out of 190 on the bank\u2019s ease of doing business metric, with a score of 48.47. If the country loosened the government\u2019s grip on the economy and reached the same score as neighboring Botswana (64.94), it would boom, as it did during the unity government years.Steve H.

{"Headline": "Saad Hariri Quits as Lebanon Prime Minister, Blaming Iran", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon said on Saturday that he had quit his post, blaming Iran for interference in Arab affairs and throwing his country, already awash with tensions and regional rivalries, into deeper uncertainty.Mr. Hariri, speaking in a televised address from the Saudi capital, Riyadh, issued a blistering condemnation of Iran and its growing power and influence in the region. He also assailed Iran\u2019s Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, the Shiite militia and political party that is part of the national unity cabinet he led.\u201cWherever Iran settles, it sows discord, devastation and destruction, proven by its interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries,\u201d Mr. Hariri said, adding that Iran\u2019s \u201chands\u201d in the region \u201cwill be cut off.\u201dThe surprise announcement \u2014 which shocked even his own staff \u2014 was an ominous sign of the escalating regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, analysts said, indicating the growing dominance of Iran and Hezbollah as well as the Saudis\u2019 increasingly assertive response.Lebanese and regional analysts, whether supporters or opponents of Hezbollah, said it appeared that Mr. Hariri had been pressured to resign by his patrons, the Saudis, as they and the United States ratchet up efforts to counter Iranian influence. The resignation came after weeks of sharp American and Saudi condemnations of Iran, including from President Trump, and new American sanctions against Hezbollah.By pushing out Mr. Hariri, analysts said, Saudi Arabia could deny Hezbollah a credible Sunni governing partner \u2014 an attempt to isolate it and deny it the fig leaf of a national unity government.\u201cThey concluded that Hariri was serving as more of a cover for Iranian and Hezbollah influence than as a counterweight to them,\u201d said Rob Malley, a former special Middle East adviser to President Barack Obama and the vice president of the International Crisis Group.Yet the resignation also shows how few options Iran\u2019s opponents have. Without Mr. Hariri in power, the United States and Saudi Arabia lose their main partner in the Lebanese government.Across the political spectrum, analysts and officials said the resignation ushered in new dangers. If the next government is more pro-Hezbollah, they said, that could lead to devastating sanctions. It could even increase the chances of a new war with Israel, which would see added justification for its argument that there is little distinction between Hezbollah and the Lebanese state.Mr. Hariri even raised the specter of internal violence. He compared the atmosphere in Lebanon now to the days before the 2005 assassination of his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying he believed his own life was in danger. \u201cI sensed what\u2019s being woven in secret to target my life,\u201d he said.Mr. Hariri\u2019s father was killed when his motorcade was bombed on Beirut\u2019s seafront. Several Hezbollah members are being tried in absentia in a special United Nations-backed tribunal in The Hague, although the militant group has denied involvement in the assassination.Saad Hariri became prime minister in late 2016, in a compromise deal after Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, became president, ending a two-and-a-half-year political deadlock.Lebanon, which is governed by a sect-based political system, has long been deeply divided between a bloc aligned with Shiite Hezbollah and Iran, and one aligned with Saudi Arabia, the dominant Sunni country in the region.Mr. Hariri headed a 30-member national unity cabinet that was crafted to protect the country from any spillover from the multisided war in neighboring Syria, where Iran backed the government and Saudi Arabia backed the insurgents.That mission has largely been successful, even though Hezbollah has sided with the Syrian government, Lebanese Sunni militants have joined insurgents there, and well over one million refugees flooded this small Mediterranean country.In Lebanon\u2019s political system, power is divided between a prime minister, who must be Sunni; a president, who must be Maronite Christian; and a speaker of Parliament, who must be Shiite.The exercise of real power in the country is a more complicated affair of alliances, rivalries and division of spoils between the leaders of sectarian groups, including former warlords from Lebanon\u2019s civil war.Hezbollah, which rose to prominence fighting the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, is the strongest because of its powerful militia, which can act independently of the state and in recent years has served as an expeditionary force across Syria.In recent years Lebanon\u2019s rival blocs have essentially agreed to confine their fight to Syria. But tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have only increased.In addition to Hezbollah\u2019s decisive role in helping President Bashar al-Assad of Syria hold on to power, Iran has supported several militias in Iraq that have managed to defeat Islamic State forces in that country and remain a fighting force.Iranian leaders say their interference is needed to stop terrorism, and to create a security zone for their country. The country\u2019s influence started to rise after the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq in 2011, leaving behind an incomplete army and a pro-Iranian government.Iran\u2019s filling of the vacuum created by the departure of the United States military has been an extremely worrying development for Saudi Arabia and some other Arab states, who have seen their efforts to fight proxy wars with Iran largely fail.And now that the Syrian war seems to be entering a new phase, with Mr. Assad still ruling a devastated country, there are fears that tensions that had been pushed to the back burner \u2014 inside Lebanon, between Hezbollah and Israel, and elsewhere \u2014 could re-emerge.The United States has stepped up sanctions on Hezbollah in recent weeks after President Trump criticized Iran and the landmark nuclear deal it reached under Mr. Obama.\u201cIt signals a new phase of escalation,\u201d said Ali Rizk, a pro-Hezbollah Lebanese analyst, adding that after the Islamic State is defeated, the United States will put new pressure on what it sees as Shiite extremists. \u201cLebanon is in for a hard time,\u201d Mr. Rizk said.The resignation brought sharp words from Israel and Iran. Bahram Ghasemi, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s foreign ministry, said Mr. Hariri\u2019s speech was driven by a Saudi, American and Israeli effort aimed at \u201ccreating tension in Lebanon and the region.\u201dAnd in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the resignation \u201ca wake-up call for the international community to take action against the Iranian aggression.\u201dThe pressure now is on the Lebanese president, Mr. Aoun, who will hold consultations with Parliament about appointing a caretaker government, said Imad Salamey, an analyst at the Lebanese American University in Beirut.\u201cIf he indeed is going to bring in a pro-Hezbollah government, then he has to face the consequences,\u201d such as new sanctions, Mr. Salamey said. \u201cIt will be a massive U.S. and Saudi response. The economy will collapse for sure.\u201dIn his speech, Mr. Hariri said he wanted to unite Lebanon and free it from outside influence. He pronounced himself \u201cfull of optimism and hope that Lebanon will be stronger, free, independent, with no authority over it except that of its own great people.\u201dBut in the streets of Tariq al-Jdeedeh, a mostly Sunni neighborhood of Beirut that is part of Mr. Hariri\u2019s political base, anger and confusion contrasted with the posters of Mr. Hariri that festooned the buildings.\u201cHariri didn\u2019t do this for Lebanon, he did this for Saudi against Iran,\u201d said Nabil Idriss, who was tending his son\u2019s fabric shop. \u201cNow with this move, the picture is more transparent than ever. Saad Hariri was never in control.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect affiliation for Imad Salamey. He is an analyst at the Lebanese American University in Beirut, not the American University of Beirut.Hwaida Saad, Nada Homsi and Somini Sengupta contributed reporting from Beirut, Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As U.S. Sheds Role as Climate Change Leader, Who Will Fill the Void?", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBONN, Germany \u2014 When President Trump announced in June that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement, America officially ceded its global leadership on climate change.It was a dramatic shift, and it was meant to be.Political analysts say it\u2019s not clear whether any of them can replace the United States and the immense diplomatic machinery it commands when engaged on an issue. Here\u2019s a look at some of the strengths those leaders bring and the challenges they face.Yet skepticism abounds. While the country is ahead of its Paris target, China still burns more coal than any other country. It also remains to be seen how eager the country will be to allow greater transparency of its own carbon reduction efforts, and many fear it will revert to old demands that it and other developing countries be treated with softer rules.For many years Canada was considered a laggard on climate change, leaving the Kyoto Protocol and rarely making an impression at United Nations negotiations.But the country is still struggling to deliver meaningful climate change policy at home, and Mr. Trudeau in recent months has approved bitumen pipelines and liquid natural gas projects. Activists in Canada say if Mr. Trudeau wants to be a true leader, he\u2019ll have to reject new fossil fuel infrastructure \u2014 something that will be a steep and perhaps unmeetable challenge.Two years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, the world remains far off course from preventing drastic global warming in the decades ahead.When the Trump administration opted not to have a United States pavilion at the Bonn climate talks to highlight American efforts on climate change, Mr. Bloomberg and others agreed to pay for it. Now the American pavilion is hosting a sort of shadow delegation of local leaders who say they are representing a different face of government. \u201cI feel very strongly America should be represented there,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said.Yet without participation from more states, particularly those that are fossil-fuel heavy, the United States as a whole will still fall short of the Paris pledge, several analyses have found.It\u2019s not clear how much those leaders\u2019 efforts will shift United States policy. As Frank V. Maisano, a partner at the law firm Bracewell who represents energy clients, said recently, \u201cTrump\u2019s supporters don\u2019t care that Macron is yelling at him. They like that.\u201dMr. Gutteres stepped into his new role in January, and those who work with him say the former prime minister of Portugal jumped in with both feet. Mr. Guterres made sure climate change was highlighted during the United Nations General Assembly, meeting with former Vice President Al Gore and Governor Brown of California to discuss ways the United Nations can promote solutions. He also opened a special session to discuss climate change and its impact on small islands after several devastating hurricanes battered the Caribbean.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Finance Minister Seeks to Placate Angry Young Voters", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith a potentially perilous exit from the European Union looming, many Britons face a squeeze on living standards, but for one group, it may prove particularly tough.That danger could also prove critical for Mr. Hammond\u2019s Conservative Party. The divide between generations, long debated in Britain, became a newly urgent topic for the Conservatives after a general election in June, in which they unexpectedly lost their majority in Parliament. Young voters turned out in force for the opposition Labour Party, led by the left-wing Jeremy Corbyn.The budget introduced on Wednesday abolished the stamp duty, a tax paid on home purchases, for first-time buyers of properties costing up to 300,000 pounds, or about $397,000, and on the first \u00a3300,000 of first-time home purchases up to \u00a3500,000.That measure, however, could result in higher home prices instead of more affordable real estate, according to Britain\u2019s independent fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. It warned that \u201cthe main gainers\u201d from the policy could be \u201cpeople who already own property\u201d and are able to sell for even higher prices.Mr. Hammond also promised \u00a315.3 billion over five years for measures to encourage construction, and an inquiry into claims that developers were hoarding land on which houses could be built. The government was ready to use compulsory purchase powers \u201cas necessary,\u201d Mr. Hammond said.\u201cThis is our plan to deliver on the pledge we have made to the next generation, that the dream of homeownership will become a reality in this country once again,\u201d he said.Responding to Mr. Hammond\u2019s speech, Mr. Corbyn, the Labour leader, described it as \u201ca record of failure with a forecast of more.\u201d\u201cEconomic growth has been revised down,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said. \u201cProductivity growth has been revised down. Business investment revised down. People\u2019s wages and living standards revised down.\u201dThe finance minister\u2019s own political position is acutely vulnerable, and his room for maneuver limited, as he deals with slower than expected growth in productivity in Britain and as he prepares for the possibility that Brexit will significantly damage the economy.They include Nigel Lawson, a former chancellor, who called for Mr. Hammond to be fired, saying that his unwillingness to prepare for life without a Brexit agreement was \u201cvery close to sabotage.\u201dIn his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Hammond promised \u00a33 billion for Brexit preparations, in addition to \u00a3700 million already committed, adding, \u201cNo one should doubt our resolve.\u201dOn the question of housing affordability in Britain, most analysts blame a lack of supply, a view Mr. Hammond appears to accept.\u201cWe will not allow the current young generation to be the first since the Black Death not to be more prosperous than its parents\u2019 generation,\u201d he added.Housing is just one area in which Mr. Hammond\u2019s own lawmakers have demanded more spending, as evidence increases that services like health care are overstretched, and that Britons are fed up with the wage restraint and the cuts to government spending since the financial crisis.On Wednesday, Mr. Hammond promised \u00a33.75 billion more for Britain\u2019s National Health Service over the next three years, with the possibility of extra to cover a potential pay raise for nurses. Other measures included decision to expand a rail-travel discount program for people under 25 to include those under 30.Over all, the budget contained \u00a325 billion of new spending in total.So far the British economy has defied the worst predictions made in the run-up to the 2016 referendum. Borrowing has been slightly lower than predicted, giving a little more wiggle room in the short term. But, already, what was recently the fastest-growing developed economy has dropped to the bottom of that league, as businesses fret about investment decisions amid uncertainty about Brexit.Inflation has risen, largely because of a drop in the value of the pound against other currencies. That, in turn, has produced a small increase in interest rates. And with wage growth being sluggish, living standards have been squeezed.On Wednesday, Mr. Hammond announced that the Office for Budget Responsibility had cut its forecasts for economic growth over the next five years, based on lower growth in productivity.Where once it predicted growth of 2 percent in 2017, with a slowdown to 1.6 percent in 2018 followed by a gradual recovery back to 2 percent growth in 2021, the office now foresees growth of 1.5 percent in 2017, falling slightly over subsequent years and recovering only to 1.6 percent in 2022.\u201cFor a medium-sized open economy whose fortunes are strongly linked to its close neighbors, such a large downgrade is highly unusual,\u201d Kallum Pickering, a senior economist at Berenberg Bank, wrote in a note to clients. This, he added, \u201creflects the seriousness of the economic challenges facing the Brexit-stricken U.K. and the uncertainty about what is around the corner.\u201dMr. Hammond\u2019s basket of policies, including measures to ease the housing crunch, cut some income taxes and provide modest help to increase research and development, \u201cfall short of what is needed\u201d to improve long-term prospects, Mr. Pickering wrote.Advertisement"}

The only difference now, he said, was that one faction of the governing party had \u201coutcompeted its rival, and now Mnangagwa\u2019s bootlickers will have their full turn to loot from the state coffers.\u201dIn his address, Mr. Mnangagwa (pronounced muh-nahn-GAHG-wah) said that the country\u2019s domestic politics had \u201cbecome poisoned and rancorous and polarizing,\u201d apparently referring to the factional fighting inside the governing party, ZANU-PF.\u201cWe should never remain hostages of our past,\u201d Mr. Mnangagwa said, adding that his compatriots should \u201clet bygones be bygones, readily embracing each other in defining a new destiny in our beloved Zimbabwe.\u201dThe tens of thousands present in the stadium \u2014 most of them ZANU-PF die-hards who had been bused into the capital, Harare, from distant towns and villages in the party\u2019s rural strongholds \u2014 loudly cheered Mr. Mnangagwa and hailed him as a \u201chero\u201d and \u201cliberator.\u201dEmerson Zinyera, 54, a retired police officer, said: \u201cToday is true independence day. The one that was there was false. Today is independence that everyone, every Zimbabwean, can enjoy, not independence enjoyed by two people, Mugabe and his wife, Grace.\u201d\u201cThis is a happy day,\u201d said Virginia Kamoto, 34, a ZANU-PF member who was bused in with other supporters from southern Zimbabwe. \u201cI was personally tired of Mugabe, who had stayed for far too long in power. I hope President Mnangagwa will not overstay in power. I hope he will not repress the people or tolerate corruption so that our country will be counted among the great nations of the world.\u201dMr. Mnangagwa\u2019s exact role in the military intervention that led to Mr. Mugabe\u2019s downfall is not yet known. But on Wednesday, just hours after returning to Zimbabwe from South Africa, Mr. Mnangagwa thanked the generals who had backed him, saying he had been \u201cin constant contact with the service chiefs throughout\u201d the recent events.The victory of Mr. Mnangagwa and the military \u2014 over a ZANU-PF faction led by Mr. Mugabe\u2019s 52-year-old wife, Grace, and younger politicians with no experience in the nation\u2019s war of liberation \u2014 underscored the old guard\u2019s enduring grip on power, not only in Zimbabwe but also in nations like Angola, Mozambique, Namibia and South Africa.Mr. Mnangagwa reached out to rivals, though only in general terms. He praised the man he had helped topple by saying that \u201chistory will grant him his proper place and accord him his deserved stature as one of the founding fathers and leaders of our nation.\u201d\u201cTo me personally, he remains a father, mentor, comrade in arms and my leader,\u201d he said of Mr. Mugabe, who did not attend the inauguration.But whether his conciliatory words translate to action remains to be seen. Local and international organizations have said that several leaders of the losing faction were arrested and detained by the army, which is not authorized to do so. Some are still missing, their homes have been ransacked and their relatives beaten, human rights groups say.For years, Mr. Mnangagwa, who served as Mr. Mugabe\u2019s personal assistant and bodyguard during the war of liberation, had seemed a natural heir. As one of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s top lieutenants, he has been accused of spearheading Mr. Mugabe\u2019s most ruthless policies \u2014 including the massacre of thousands of civilians in the early 1980s, the invasion of white-owned farms in 2000 and the violent rigging of polls during the 2008 election.But on Nov. 6, Mr. Mnangagwa was fired as vice president by Mr. Mugabe after losing a political battle against the faction led by Mrs. Mugabe, who had vowed to succeed her husband. Mr. Mnangagwa, who said he feared for his life, fled Zimbabwe, crossing the border into neighboring Mozambique on foot, and eventually arriving in South Africa.In Africa Unity Square, the capital\u2019s main public area, thousands celebrated Mr. Mugabe\u2019s resignation on Tuesday, partying late into the evening. On Friday, a few hours after the new president\u2019s address, the mood was subdued.Remind Mugumba, 36, a wedding photographer, had watched Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s address in a bar.\u201cI was at Africa Unity Square on Tuesday celebrating when news broke out that Mugabe had resigned,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure really there is nothing much to celebrate because this is just another ZANU-PF person coming to lead us, and really not much change will come from him.\u201dArtwell Mugari, 44, a security guard at a nearby hotel, said that on Tuesday he was caught up in the moment and found himself celebrating with the crowds pouring into the square.By Friday afternoon, though, his mood had changed. With a younger and stronger leader, ZANU-PF had now been reinvigorated, not replaced, he said.\u201cI\u2019m worried that the opposition may now never find another chance to rule,\u201d Mr. Mugari said. \u201cMnangagwa was Mugabe\u2019s right-hand man who did all the dirty work for him at every election.

{"Headline": "Republicans Are All In on Tax Plans, but Face Real Political Risk", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans who have struggled to accomplish much of anything are now fully invested in quickly pulling off one of the most difficult legislative feats of all \u2014 enacting a complicated rewrite of the federal tax code through a proposal littered with political land mines.With the Senate on Thursday unveiling its companion to the House tax overhaul, Republican leaders began carefully counting votes and calculating what it would take to secure a badly needed victory. Republicans in both the House and Senate believe they can ultimately prevail \u2014 though the end result might cost some Republicans their congressional seats next year. But they are not 100 percent certain, and are well aware that the slightest adjustment in the tax proposal to win one vote can just as easily drive off a few others.\u201cI think it will go through, but who knows?\u201d said Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who was around for the last major tax fight in 1986. \u201cWe will have to wait and see.\u201dThe two Republican plans \u2014 no Democrats are actively engaged in the negotiations \u2014 differ in substantial respects but share major elements, such as doubling of the standard deduction, increasing the child tax credit and trying to spur economic growth through a cut in the corporate tax rate.One difference presents a huge political problem. The Senate would eliminate the ability of individuals to deduct state and local taxes while the House includes a compromise that would allow taxpayers to take deductions of up to $10,000 in property taxes. That issue was already an obstacle in the House, and House Republicans say no final plan can survive the House if state and local tax deductions are fully prohibited.\u201cThere will have to be an accommodation on SALT,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, using the congressional acronym for state and local taxes.The tax push represents a determined \u2014 some would say desperate \u2014 effort by Republicans in charge of the governing apparatus to notch a meaningful achievement by the end of a year that started with promise for them because of their control of Congress and the White House. But a failure to follow through on their oft-repeated promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and their inability to get much traction on other major legislation has left them grasping for success \u2014 a need made even more urgent by the beating the party took around the country in Tuesday\u2019s off-year elections.Even if they are able to send a tax bill to the president\u2019s desk, it could be costly in the end for Republicans in higher tax states such as California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York if state and local tax deductions are barred.\u201cTax cuts sound great, but tax cuts for the rest of the country while my constituents are getting a tax increase is a loser and it is wrong,\u201d said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York.He said the middle-class and blue-collar voters in his Long Island district who supported Mr. Trump last year now felt betrayed at the prospect of losing deductions that many of them rely on to hold their federal taxes down in a region with stiff local property and income taxes.But some Republicans quietly say the loss of a few seats might be the price they have to pay for success to satisfy other constituents and business supporters hungry for a tax break.Most Republican senators are eager to vote for a tax bill, but there are enough question marks in the Senate ranks to leave the final outcome in doubt because of the narrow 52-48 divide and the fact that no Democrats are on board as yet.Senators James Lankford of Oklahoma, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona have all raised alarm about any explosion in the federal deficit driven by the bill. \u201cI remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy,\u201d said Mr. Flake, who has broken with the Trump administration and is retiring from the Senate.In addition, Senator John McCain of Arizona is a perpetual wild card and Senator Susan Collins of Maine has issues with repeal of the estate tax as well as elimination of state and local tax deductions.\u201cI am in favor of overhauling the tax code to provide tax cuts to working families and small businesses and to encourage the creation of jobs here in America rather than overseas, but I hope that further changes will be made in the Senate bill,\u201d Ms. Collins said.Senate tax writers did maintain some of the popular tax breaks eliminated in the House proposal and did not tinker with the mortgage interest deduction \u2014 another politically charged provision. But in the end the bills will have to be reconciled into a final consensus proposal that still fits within budget parameters to avoid a Democratic filibuster, and there will be some political pain in reaching that point.The tax fight is reminiscent of some previous congressional moments when majority parties pushed ahead with contentious proposals only to see their numbers drastically reduced in the next election \u2014 1994 in the Clinton era, 2006 under President George W. Bush and 2010 during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term as president following the health care debate.Speaker Paul D. Ryan said the tax bill situation is different from those past experiences.\u201cThis is not unpopular,\u201d Mr. Ryan said of his tax bill, adding: \u201cWe didn\u2019t do like some of the Democrat majorities of the past, and pass some big, huge thing on an unsuspecting country. We ran in 2016 on doing this tax reform.\u201dThe American public is only now learning the details of the tax plans and how the legislation will change their taxes and personal economic situation. If a plan passes, voters will have the final word on whether it is popular or not, and what it means for the political fortunes of Republicans.Advertisement"}

Mr. Ducey learned that a local regulator was planning a sting on Lyft and Uber drivers to shut down the ride-hailing services for operating illegally. Mr. Ducey, a Republican who was the former chief executive of the ice cream chain Cold Stone Creamery, was furious.\u201cIt was the exact opposite message we should have been sending,\u201d Mr. Ducey said in an interview. \u201cWe needed our message to Uber, Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas.\u201d If the state had a slogan, he added, it would include the words \u201copen for business.\u201dArizona has since built upon the governor\u2019s action to become a favored partner for the tech industry, turning itself into a live laboratory for self-driving vehicles. Over the past two years, Arizona deliberately cultivated a rules-free environment for driverless cars, unlike dozens of other states that have enacted autonomous vehicle regulations over safety, taxes and insurance.The payoff for Arizona has been a tech boom, with dozens of autonomous vehicle companies flocking here to set up operations. Every day, Waymo, the driverless car business owned by Google\u2019s corporate parent Alphabet, as well as Uber, Lyft, General Motors and Intel now deploy hundreds of cars that drive themselves on the streets of Phoenix, a sprawling metropolis of 1.4 million people.But Arizona\u2019s permissiveness has drawn criticism from safety advocates who said the companies have too much freedom to conduct their trials on public roads. They said car companies and state officials have not solved questions about the privacy of passengers, the prevention of cyberattacks on autonomous cars, and how to insure vehicles that don\u2019t have a driver.Arizona officials said the public is essentially protected by basic rules that require a licensed driver somewhere in the driverless car. They added that they planned to take a back seat to the experts when it comes to rule-making. The state insurance regulator, for example, said he would wait for the insurance industry to guide regulators on liability policies for driverless cars, amid questions about who is responsible in a crash if the car isn\u2019t driven by a human.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be getting in the way by prescribing regulations when we really don\u2019t know how the equipment will perform,\u201d said John Halikowski, director of the Arizona Department of Transportation.The state\u2019s hands-off approach has already been tested. In March, Arizona experienced its first crash involving a driverless car, when a human-driven vehicle collided with a self-driving Uber in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. The case was quickly resolved because police said Uber\u2019s car was not at fault, but some Arizona officials acknowledged they have not thought through all the legal scenarios with autonomous car accidents.\u201cWe embrace innovation,\u201d said Mark Mitchell, the mayor of Tempe. \u201cBut there are some things we\u2019ll have to look at moving forward.\u201d\u201cWe can beat California in every metric; lower taxes, less regulations, cost of living, quality of life,\u201d he said several months after he became governor.In early 2015, Mr. Ducey\u2019s shutdown of the sting operation that would have hit Uber and Lyft had an immediate effect. Days after his decision, which the companies were made aware of by his staff, Lyft and Uber executives called the governor to thank him.By August 2015, Mr. Ducey was taking his first steps into driverless vehicles. That month, he signed an executive order supporting autonomous cars. Under that order, any driverless car could be on Arizona roads as long as a passenger had a license and the car had a basic liability insurance plan.Mr. Ducey also set up a \u201cSelf-Driving Vehicle Oversight Committee\u201d comprised of transportation, public safety, insurance and other regulators to advise \u201chow best to advance the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles on public roads.\u201d The group was not intended to create any new rules.And Mr. Ducey became a pitchman.Early last year at a global economic forum on the Georgia coast, Mr. Ducey said he approached Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, with a business card and talking points on the state\u2019s embrace of self-driving automakers. Shortly thereafter, Waymo scoped out Chandler to begin autonomous car tests.Chandler\u2019s officials sealed the deal with further promises to stay out of the way. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s our role to be engaged in regulation,\u201d said Micah Miranda, Chandler\u2019s director of economic development.Waymo opened operations in Chandler in August 2016, hiring dozens of local test drivers. The company hosted a grand opening with Mr. Ducey and Chandler\u2019s mayor, and held several community events to win over the public.\u201cThe enthusiasm for new tech from the public and Governor Ducey makes Arizona a place where innovation can thrive and companies like ours can set up roots,\u201d said Waymo.Mr. Ducey also traveled to Silicon Valley to visit driverless car companies and investors. In late 2016, he stopped by Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that has invested in companies including Lyft, which is working on self-driving technology. There, Mr. Ducey found an inquisitive audience about the state\u2019s regulation-free policy for self-driving cars.\u201cAlthough Washington gets much of the attention, a lot of the real action on tech policy is taking place at the state and local level,\u201d said Ted Ullyot, an Andreessen Horowitz partner who attended the meeting. \u201cGovernor Ducey is a key pro-innovation leader, making Arizona a highly welcoming environment for autonomous vehicles and other emerging technologies.\u201dIn California, Google, Uber, GM, and Ford have fought lawmakers on self-driving rules. One rule required carmakers to report on the number of times a driverless car switched from autonomous mode to human-driven mode, which irked automakers who said those statistics give a misleading impression of safety.Uber\u2019s executives called Mr. Ducey.\u201cWe responded by saying we weren\u2019t going to hassle them,\u201d Mr. Ducey said of Uber. \u201cI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t thank my partner in growing the Arizona economy, Jerry Brown,\u201d the Democratic governor of California.\u201cGovernor Ducey\u2019s prioritization of the sharing economy has made the Grand Canyon State an ideal environment for our self-driving pilot,\u201d Uber said.Under Mr. Ducey, driverless car experiments in Arizona have multiplied over the last year.Uber\u2019s self-driving Volvo SUVs now pick up customers around Tempe on a daily basis. Waymo has dispatched more than 100 Chrysler self-driving minivans to chauffeur select families and other residents as part of a closely guarded trial; the company plans to expand to 600 vehicles by the end of the year, with the majority in Chandler. And dozens of vehicles for GM, Ford, Intel, and Lyft are also covering thousands of miles a day on the flat and sun-drenched roads around Phoenix.Some residents are ambivalent. Groups representing the blind are enthusiastic supporters of driverless cars, which could give their members more independence. Others like the idea of tech-related jobs coming to the state. But some are cautious.\u201cI\u2019m on the fence,\u201d said Jake Guadarrama, 22, a Phoenix area resident. \u201cWhat if the battery died on the car and it goes out of control? And will it take way from the work force?\u201dThose questions are not just academic. Already, the incorporation of driverless cars into human-driven traffic has run into problems.Around dusk on March 24, for example, Alexandra Cole, a Tempe resident, inched her 2008 Honda CRV into a busy suburban intersection in the city. With five seconds left on the pedestrian crossing signal and no cars coming toward her in the two closest lanes, she began a left turn.She did not see Uber\u2019s self-driving Volvo SUV darting through the yellow light in the furthest lane toward her. The cars collided. Uber\u2019s vehicle flipped onto its side and crashed into two more cars waiting in traffic.But what happened after the accident revealed a system that was unprepared for computer-operated vehicles. Mr. Ducey, Tempe officials and state transportation regulators did not get briefed on the collision. The self-driving task force set up by the governor, which has met twice in two years, also did not review the incident.Uber sent its wrecked vehicle to its Pittsburgh-based autonomous vehicle center, which the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration officials visited to investigate. N.H.T.S.A. said it could not comment because its investigation is still in progress. Ms. Cole and her insurance company declined to comment.Insurance would also have been a question, with debate over who takes responsibility in a driverless car crash \u2014 the company or the third-party software or parts makers or the passenger with a license \u2014 since there is no driver.\u201cThe insurance companies need to figure out how they will insure this,\u201d said Stephen Briggs, a spokesman for Arizona\u2019s Department of Insurance. Arizona hasn\u2019t changed its minimum insurance liability rules for self-driving car trials. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have the resources to do this.\u201dAngel Carbajal, Tempe\u2019s assistant chief of police, acknowledged there are many unknowns. \u201cThis is new, so there isn\u2019t a lot of legislation yet that explains how to respond to motor vehicle collisions involving autonomous vehicles,\u201d he said.For Mr. Ducey, none of this is a problem. He said the crash was handled properly and that even if driverless technology is not fully ready, the state\u2019s bet on autonomous vehicles will continue.\u201cThese are cultural opportunities for Arizona to be seen as a place to live, work and play,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s the Economic Cost of Brexit? Pineapples Tell a Tale", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySITTINGBOURNE, England \u2014 Britain is increasingly grappling with the bewildering economic consequences of its pending departure from the European Union. For one company, Nim\u2019s Fruit Crisps, the impact is measured in the soaring cost of pineapple.Nim\u2019s dries fruits into snacks served up like potato chips, operating out of a former metal shop in this industrial enclave east of London. One of its best-selling varieties uses pineapple from Costa Rica that is shipped in by an Amsterdam-based trading company.The pineapple is priced in euros. Since Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union \u2014 widely known as Brexit \u2014 the British pound has surrendered nearly 14 percent of its value against the euro on fears that trade will be disrupted.Confronting higher prices for pineapple, the company\u2019s founder, Nimisha Raja, recently brought in a machine to replace three workers who used to peel fruit by hand. \u201cI had to cut costs somewhere,\u201d she said.She could be speaking for all of Britain.In the 16 months since the referendum that set Brexit in motion, the British economy has weakened in the face of a confounding array of uncertainties. Thrift is the order of the day, along with worries about multinational companies\u2019 paring their investments in Britain.The drop in the pound has lifted prices on goods ranging from Italian olive oil to Chinese-made electronics. The rate of inflation reached 3 percent in September, the fastest pace in five years. Consumer spending has dipped over the past year while consumer credit is rising \u2014 a combination that often ends badly.The Brexit referendum prompted negotiations through which Britain and a jilted Europe are supposed to hash out their future dealings. But the talks have proved acrimonious and largely futile. This has heightened concerns that a two-year deadline on negotiations could pass without a deal, subjecting companies that trade across the English Channel with unsettling ambiguities about future rules. The Bank of England has been warning banks to prepare for that very eventuality as one possible outcome.With the boundaries of commerce unclear, some companies are reassessing the appeal of centering operations in Britain, the former seat of a global empire that increasingly looks like an island nation.\u201cClearly, growth has slowed quite sharply over the last several months,\u201d said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. \u201cThere is a sense that companies have been postponing investment.\u201dBritain now stands as one of the world\u2019s weakest major economies, even as Europe, Asia and North America enjoy relatively robust growth. Over the first nine months of the year, the British economy expanded at an annualized rate of only 1.3 percent.Absent a deal, global banks are confronting the prospect that they could no longer use their London office to serve customers across the Continent. Many have been scouting spaces in financial centers that are firmly within European Union territory.The chamber pinned the blame on \u201cuncertainty caused by the outcome of the E.U. referendum,\u201d which was \u201cdelaying investment decisions, a trend echoed in other areas of the U.K.\u201dChamber representatives have been turning their attention beyond the European Union in pursuit of fresh investment. A delegation recently returned from Turkey. In planning future visits, the chamber is especially focused on cultivating business with members of the British Commonwealth.\u201cIt\u2019s a rewinding of history, overtly looking for trade with Commonwealth countries, rather than with Europe,\u201d said John Lamb, a chamber spokesman. \u201cWe really are starting to look at markets in the post-Brexit world.\u201dAt the KimberMills International factory in the Black Country west of Birmingham, workers use tongs to pluck glowing orange blocks of steel from a caldron-like furnace, then pound the metal into desired shapes using a three-and-a-half-ton hammer hoisted by a pulley.Other workers guide lathes and drills to yield an assortment of industrial parts \u2014 rockers for marine engines, clamps for oil pipelines, components for gearboxes of construction machinery.The plunge in the pound has raised the price of steel the company imports from Sweden, the Czech Republic and Italy. The company has raised its prices to adjust.KimberMills taps a forge in Eastern Europe to produce large parts that are beyond its works in England. If Britain fails to strike a trade deal with Europe, these parts could face tariffs. The company has already begun seeking out alternative suppliers in Britain.\u201cDespite everything that happens, there\u2019s a resilience to the British market,\u201d said Larry Joyce, the company chairman. \u201cWe just get on with it.\u201dBut on a recent afternoon at the Great Western pub, a cozy, beer-scented den in Wolverhampton, people worried that such sentiments were being overwhelmed by the economic realities of Brexit.The pub has been doing a brisk business, owing to the success of the local soccer team, the Wolverhampton Wanderers, whose stadium is within walking distance. But customers were nursing woes.\u201cBrexit is a disaster,\u201d said Richard Lloyd, 48, the proprietor of a local construction company, as he hoisted a pint of Guinness. \u201cIt\u2019s thrown a lot of people into uncertainty. Companies are certainly delaying investment. They are being very cautious.\u201dTwo years ago, Mr. Lloyd employed as many as 20 people. These days, he has only four. \u201cIf things were going really swimmingly, I\u2019d hire more,\u201d he said.A local taxi driver, B. Maan, recalled how he used to take home 200 pounds, or about $266, in the course of a Saturday night, ferrying revelers to pubs. These days, he is fortunate to secure 120 pounds.\u201cPeople are spending less,\u201d he said.Time itself has become a threat. As negotiations yield headlines about sniping within Britain\u2019s governing Conservative party, each week that passes absent clarity amplifies pressure on companies to shift people and operations to Europe.\u201cWe can\u2019t see how investment particularly, but also consumption, will not be affected,\u201d said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. \u201cHow can you go ahead with big investments when you don\u2019t know what framework will result?\u201dFor Nim\u2019s Fruit Crisps, the variables of Brexit have advanced British self-sufficiency.Previously reliant on a supplier in Belgium for most of its fruits and vegetables, the company has in recent months found domestic suppliers for every needed variety except pineapple, limiting its exposure to the vagaries of exchange rates. Today, Nim\u2019s buys apples, parsnips, cucumbers and a range of other crops from British farmers.The fall in the pound has also made Nim\u2019s products cheaper outside Britain, bolstering its exports, which now make up more than half of total sales. Nim\u2019s snacks are sold in Germany, France, Italy, India, Israel and \u2014 soon \u2014 Saudi Arabia.\u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is that Europe isn\u2019t the only market for us,\u201d said Ms. Raja, whose Nim\u2019s business card identifies her as TheBoss.Yet as she seeks to complete a deal putting her crisps on the shelves of a major British supermarket chain, Ms. Raja worries that the needed volumes will exceed the capacities of Britain.\u201cI suddenly have to find 100 tons of apples,\u201d she said.She is scoping out farms in Poland, even as she worries about the value of British money in a world shaped by Brexit.\u201cI have to keep my margins tight,\u201d she said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a town in England, and an earlier correction misstated which company operated there. The town is Cradley Heath, not Sittingbourne, and the plant there is operated by KimberMills International, not Nim\u2019s Fruit Crisps.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair Nominee, Sees Continuity if Confirmed", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jerome H. Powell, nominated by President Trump to lead the Federal Reserve, presented himself as a pragmatic moderate who would largely continue the Fed\u2019s current policies at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.\u201cI think that the case for raising interest rates at our next meeting is coming together,\u201d he said.Mr. Powell, 64, is a lawyer by training and an investment banker by trade, with deep roots in the financial industry and the Republican Party. Since joining the Fed, he has voted in favor of every policy decision \u2014 both monetary policy and regulatory policy \u2014 under the current Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke.\u201cGovernor Powell has proved he is qualified to lead the Fed,\u201d Senator Mike Crapo, the Idaho Republican who chairs the committee, declared in the opening moments of Tuesday\u2019s hearing.Some Democrats have indicated they might oppose the nomination. But, importantly, Mr. Powell drew little opposition from conservative Republicans who opposed both his nomination as a Fed governor in 2012 and his reappointment in 2014. Senator Dean Heller, a Nevada Republican who voted against Mr. Powell both times, said he was trying to get to yes.He added that he had no reason to anticipate such pressure from the White House. \u201cNothing in my conversations with anyone in the administration has given me any concern on that front,\u201d he said. His plan, he said, is to make policy decisions \u201cwith a view solely to right answers.\u201dThe confirmation hearing was a relatively placid affair, with only a third of the seats in the hearing room occupied. Both Mr. Bernanke in 2010 and Ms. Yellen in 2014 were confirmed during periods of economic turmoil and sharp controversy about the conduct of monetary and regulatory policy. As economic growth has strengthened, public interest in those subjects has dissipated.Asked whether Congress should pursue tax cuts that would increase the federal debt, he said that such questions should be left to Congress. He said the Fed had no position on the legislation.\u201cDo you have a personal position?\u201d pressed Mr. Heller.\u201cNo, Senator, I don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Powell responded.Asked by Democrats whether he accepted the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office, which found that the legislation backed by Republicans would sharply increase the federal debt, Mr. Powell responded that he had not looked at it.Janet L. Yellen, the current Fed chairwoman, and her predecessors have often warned that the growth of the federal debt is a problem for the economy.Mr. Powell finally allowed that he shared concerns about borrowing too much, in the abstract.\u201cWithout commenting on any particular bill, like all of us I am concerned about the sustainability of our fiscal path in the long run,\u201d Mr. Powell said.On regulation, Mr. Powell said that postcrisis changes have made the financial system stronger, but that those regulations were unnecessarily uniform.He said he favored reduced regulation of smaller banks.\u201cTailoring of regulation is one of our most fundamental principles,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want it to decrease in intensity and stringency as we move down\u201d to smaller banks.He said the Fed was taking \u201ca fresh look\u201d at those rules.It also created some friction with Democrats, who see a continuing need for stronger regulations.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked Mr. Powell if there were rules that should be strengthened. Mr. Powell responded that he favored stronger enforcement in some areas, but that he did not see a need for stronger rules.\u201cI do think we\u2019ve had eight years now of writing new rules and honestly I can\u2019t think of a place now where we are lacking,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re tough enough.\u201dSome Republicans argue the Fed should have raised interest rates more quickly.Mr. Powell said he does not agree. \u201cWe\u2019ve been patient in removing accommodation and I think that patience has served us well,\u201d he told the committee.He emphasized that it was important to drive inflation back up to the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as optimal. Inflation is on pace to fall short of that target for the sixth straight year.Indeed, Mr. Powell sounded less impressed by the health of the economy than some of his colleagues. A number of Fed officials have said that the economy is back at full employment, meaning that further reductions in unemployment will tend to drive up wages and inflation.But Mr. Powell suggested that there might still be room for growth.\u201cThere is no indication in wages that the labor market is overheating or even hot,\u201d he said.Mr. Powell, who would become the first non-economist in several decades to lead the central bank, also sounded confident in his own abilities to steer policy.\u201cYou\u2019re about to become the most important economic policymaker in the world,\u201d Mr. Heller asked. \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201dResponded Mr. Powell, \u201cI feel fine.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Crisis, Angela Merkel Prefers Elections to Minority Rule", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany faced the greatest crisis of her career on Monday after negotiations to form a new government collapsed, shaking a country that is Europe\u2019s political and economic anchor.The breakdown abruptly raised the prospect of new elections in Germany. It came less than two months after the last elections seemed to assure that Ms. Merkel, an icon of Western democracy and values, would remain Germany\u2019s leader for a fourth term.The chancellor said she remained hopeful about forming a majority government. But if forced to choose, Ms. Merkel said, she would prefer to go through new elections rather than try to lead a minority government.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say never, but I am very skeptical, and believe that new elections would be the better way forward,\u201d the chancellor told the public broadcaster ARD.Calling new elections is not a straightforward procedure in Germany. Written with the unstable governments of the 1920s and 1930s and collapse of the Weimar Republic in mind, the German Constitution includes several procedural hurdles that would ensure a prolonged and difficult process.Some were quick to link Germany\u2019s disorder to a broader crisis of democracy in the West. \u201cThe unthinkable has happened,\u201d said Christiane Hoffmann, deputy head of the Berlin bureau of Der Spiegel, a German magazine. In that sense, she said, \u201cThis is Germany\u2019s Brexit moment, its Trump moment.\u201dOthers said Germany\u2019s troubles were in many ways just a sign that the country was becoming more normal, not less. Having had only four chancellors since 1982, the country has known only a string of centrist governments that governed by consensus.The crisis erupted seven weeks after the last election, which brought the right-wing Alternative for Germany, or AfD, into Parliament, and in some ways represented the return of politics to a country long deprived of debate and policy disagreements.\u201cIt\u2019s just another step in the long learning of democracy of Germany since World War II, going from a very stable proportional system to something more messy,\u201d said Henrik Enderlein, dean of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin.The bigger question, he said, was whether Ms. Merkel\u2019s pragmatic governing style had reached its limit in an era where people crave the clash of a wider spectrum of policies. \u201cHer \u00fcber-pragmatism is reaching its end,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a scenario where she returns to her previous position of power.\u201dMs. Merkel met in private on Monday with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who as head of state is charged with trying to break the deadlock in coalition talks. He could appoint a chancellor to lead a minority government or, failing that, set in motion the process for new elections.The potential for instability in Germany would be a major blow to the European Union. Ms. Merkel has been the region\u2019s dominant political figure of the past decade, credited with guiding the bloc through the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and, more recently, providing a powerful counterpoint to populists across the Continent and beyond.Financial markets reacted calmly to the turmoil in Berlin, calculating that the German economy could power through the uncertainty. After opening lower, the DAX index of major stocks closed the day higher. The euro fell slightly.But some economists warned that the longer-term effects could be more severe. A weak government might be unable to agree on needed improvements to infrastructure and the education system, for example.\u201cThe economic situation is very good,\u201d Christoph M. Schmidt, chairman of the German Council of Economic Experts, said in a statement. \u201cBut over the mid and long term there are big challenges, especially the demographic shift, digitalization, sensible development of the European Union, and climate change.\u201dEven so, political analysts had expected Ms. Merkel to form a new coalition government that would have allowed her to remain as chancellor. That may still happen, but it will be harder now, and it is unlikely to happen soon, experts say.Elsewhere in Europe, the possibility of a weakened Ms. Merkel and of an inward-looking Germany alarmed some leaders. The chancellor canceled a meeting in Berlin with Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands. In Paris, President Emmanuel Macron of France said that Ms. Merkel\u2019s difficulties were a serious hurdle to the partnership between their two countries.France has \u201cno interest in a worsening of the situation\u201d in Germany, Mr. Macron said in a statement on Monday. \u201cOur wish is that our main partner, for the sake of Germany and Europe, remains strong and stable, so that we can move forward together,\u201d he added.Mr. Macron will be aware that his agenda for the bloc, which includes a common defense force, a strengthened euro, and a joint finance minister, stands no chance without German backing.Ms. Merkel had originally set Friday as the deadline for reaching an agreement with the Free Democrats, the Greens, and the Christian Social Union, which forms a conservative bloc with the chancellor\u2019s Christian Democrats. From the outset, all of those parties had differed markedly on key issues, notably migration and climate policies, resulting in strained talks that led to open sniping.Ms. Merkel could try to approach the Social Democrats about forming another grand coalition. But the center-left party has served as the junior coalition partner to the Christian Democrats since 2013 and on Monday, the party\u2019s leader, Martin Schulz, said his group had no interest in another round.As for new elections, the president can set the process in motion by proposing Ms. Merkel as chancellor, which would be put to a vote in Parliament.If Ms. Merkel were to win a majority in the first round of voting, the president could then name her as chancellor. If not, lawmakers would vote again, within 14 days.If Ms. Merkel failed to win a majority in a second vote, then lawmakers would vote a third time and the candidate with the most votes would win. At that point, the president could name that person chancellor or simply dissolve the Parliament and order new elections, which would take place within 60 days.But there is no guarantee that elections would improve the situation: Recent opinion polls predict that a new vote would bring little change, compared to the result in September. A Forsa poll released last week showed Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives at 32 percent, the Social Democrats on 20 percent, the Free Democrats at 12 percent, the Greens 10 percent and the AfD 12 percent.Some worry that the AfD could benefit from the current chaos and increase its share of the vote. But even if it did, that share remains far below that of populist movements in other countries.\u201cGermany is not leaving the E.U. and it did not elect Donald Trump,\u201d said Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff. \u201cIt was unable to form a government on its first attempt. That\u2019s bad. It causes instability. But it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the right-wing party that won seats in the September parliamentary elections. It is Alternative for Germany, not Alliance for Democracy.Melissa Eddy reported from Berlin, and Katrin Bennhold from London.

{"Headline": "Tax Bill Thrown Into Uncertainty as First G.O.P. Senator Comes Out Against It", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Uncertainty gripped the Senate on Wednesday over efforts to pass a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax cut after a Wisconsin Republican became the first senator in his party to declare that he could not vote for the tax bill as written, and other senators expressed serious misgivings over the cost and effect on the middle class.The House is set on Thursday to pass its own version of the tax bill, which would cut taxes by more than $1.4 trillion over 10 years and broadly rewrite the business tax code. But as with the health care debate earlier this year, the Senate emerged as the inconstant ally in President Trump\u2019s pursuit of a major legislative accomplishment in his first year.Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, came out against both chambers\u2019 tax plans on Wednesday, saying that the bills favored corporations over small businesses and other so-called pass-through entities, whose owners pay taxes on profits through the tax code for individuals.\u201cThese businesses truly are the engines of innovation and job creation throughout our economy, and they should not be left behind,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current versions.\u201dSenators Susan Collins of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee have voiced their own concerns about the tax overhaul and have not committed to voting for the tax bill.\u201cI\u2019m still working with folks to see if there\u2019s some way to be assured as it relates to the deficit issue that we\u2019re not going to create harm,\u201d Mr. Corker said. \u201cThere\u2019s other senators who themselves want to ensure that we\u2019re doing something to strengthen our country relative to the deficits.\u201dHe added, \u201cI\u2019m not a yes, I\u2019m not a no.\u201dWith the House expected to pass its tax legislation, the fate of the overhaul fell into the hands of Republican senators, who grappled with the political prospects of passing a bill that critics said could undermine the health care system and favored companies over the middle class. The Senate has played the spoiler before: The House passed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act in May, only to see it fail in the Senate twice.Without the mandate, more people would be uninsured and premiums would rise.Senate Republicans, eager for a major legislative achievement after the Affordable Care Act debacle, have generally been enthusiastic about the tax overhaul. But given the party\u2019s slim 52-to-48 majority in the Senate, the reluctance of even a handful of Republican senators has left open the possibility that the tax bill will be further changed or face failure.Beyond Mr. Johnson, the support of several other Republican senators was not assured, including the three who killed the party\u2019s effort to repeal the health law this summer: Ms. Collins, John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\u201cI want to see the whole package before I make a decision,\u201d Mr. McCain said.On Wednesday, Ms. Collins expressed concern that middle-income consumers could see their tax cut erased by an increase in health insurance premiums caused by the repeal of the requirement that most people have insurance, known as the individual mandate.Other Republican senators, such as Mr. Corker and Jeff Flake of Arizona, are concerned about the national debt, which topped $20 trillion even before consideration of a tax plan that could add an additional $1.5 trillion over a decade.As the Senate Finance Committee continued its formal drafting of the bill, Democrats attacked Republicans for inserting the repeal of the individual mandate and for imposing a 2025 expiration date for individual tax cuts, even as they would make the corporate tax cut permanent.\u201cThis bill seems to get worse by the hour,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cThis is not just another garden variety attack on the Affordable Care Act; this is repeal of that law.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, played down the move to make the individual tax cuts temporary, not mentioning that change in an opening statement during \u201cmarkup\u201d of the bill on Wednesday in which he defended his party\u2019s right to undo the mandate. He later suggested that Republicans would be unlikely to resist if Democrats wanted to make those cuts permanent.The dozens of changes in the legislation would add more than $1.4 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years.Mr. Hatch and Mr. Wyden raised their voices and spoke over each other as they clashed over the injection of health care into the tax debate, with Mr. Hatch at one point demanding that his leadership of the committee be respected.\u201cLet me be in control of this committee, not you,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Another Senate panel, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, voted on Wednesday to approve legislation that would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling \u2014 an opening long sought by Republicans but ardently opposed by Democrats and environmentalists.That legislation is to be merged with the tax bill, which Republicans are planning to pass using special procedures that protect against a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Under that strategy, the drilling measure would share the protection from a filibuster.Allowing drilling in the wildlife refuge, known as ANWR, is a cherished goal of the energy committee\u2019s chairwoman, Ms. Murkowski. Given her vote this summer against repealing the Affordable Care Act, Ms. Murkowski is once again a closely watched figure as the Senate plunges back into a debate over health care. But this time, with the prospect of opening the wildlife refuge to drilling, Ms. Murkowski has a major reason to vote yes.\u201cMy whole focus this week, you\u2019re going to be shocked to know, has been ANWR,\u201d she told reporters on Wednesday, brushing aside a question about the individual mandate.In the House, the biggest threat comes from Republicans in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, who have fought to preserve the deduction for state and local taxes. The House bill allows the deduction of up to $10,000 in property taxes, but that provision has not been enough to win over a number of House Republicans.If all House members vote and every Democrat opposes the bill, Republican leaders can afford to lose no more than 22 of their members for it to pass.At least five Republicans from New York and three from New Jersey have come out against the House bill. Republican leaders could also lose votes from at least a few of their members from California, another high-tax state.\u201cIt\u2019s conceivable they could come up with some last-minute numbers that don\u2019t look so bad,\u201d said Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California. \u201cBut I did not go to my constituents and ask them to vote for me in order to increase their tax load, and the bill dramatically increases the tax load on a big chunk of my constituency.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Danang, Vietnam, Trump Makes a Friendlier American Landing", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet here in Vietnam, bitter memories of the war have dissipated \u2014 even if its poisonous inheritance has not.\u201cBoth Vietnam and America lost so many men and shared such terrible pain,\u201d said Do Tuan, who won a medal for his bravery in fighting American soldiers during the war and is now a businessman in Hanoi. \u201cThe America of the past and the America of the present are different.\u201dThe legacy of the Vietnam War \u2014 or the American War, as it is known here \u2014 is particularly resonant in Danang, the first stop on Mr. Trump\u2019s two-day tour of Vietnam. The central Vietnamese city is hosting the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, where Mr. Trump is expected to give a speech on the American vision for growth in the Asia-Pacific region.In 1965, the Ninth Marine Expeditionary Brigade, the first conventional American combat unit deployed in Vietnam, landed on a beach in Danang. Hundreds of thousands more troops would follow over the next few years alone.Danang\u2019s prettiest stretch of sand, known then as China Beach, gave American troops a sun and surf respite from the war, even as the Communist forces closed in.Today Danang\u2019s beaches once again lure visitors, and a building frenzy of resorts has brought five-star luxury to one of the world\u2019s five remaining Communist nations. Danang\u2019s city planners fought hard to win rights to host the APEC forum, which will see the leaders of 21 economies in attendance, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Xi Jinping of China.Signs of the warming relationship between the United States and Vietnam are in evidence down the coast from Danang, where an American aircraft carrier is scheduled to make a port call next year, most likely at Cam Ranh Bay, the naval base once used by the Americans.\u201cWhen we fight, we must use everything we have, the ancient jungle and the deep ocean, the rivers and the mountains and our bones and flesh,\u201d said Dao Kim Long, a veteran of the American War who also fought the French as a 14-year-old guerrilla. \u201cBut when we shake hands, we can begin a friendship with all our heart.\u201dVietnam\u2019s tilt toward the United States owes much to the looming shadow of a far more enduring and challenging antagonist: China. Like many countries in the region, Vietnam is keen for an American counterweight to balance against the growing heft of China.In May, the Vietnamese were given a United States Coast Guard cutter and six new patrol boats to defend the swath of the South China Sea that Hanoi considers its own. Beijing, which has more aggressively asserted that nearly the entire waterway is its own, has clashed repeatedly with Vietnam over competing claims.There are still notable policy differences. The United States ranks as the top destination for Vietnamese exports, and Hanoi was particularly disappointed when Mr. Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, which would have given Vietnam better access to its No. 1 market.Trade is expected to be a major topic during the meetings Mr. Trump will hold with Tran Dai Quang, his Vietnamese counterpart, on Saturday in Hanoi.\u201cVietnamese officials are waiting to see if, during Trump\u2019s bilateral meetings, he stays focused on America First or if he raises more substantive suggestions about how the two countries can engage economically,\u201d said Murray Hiebert, a senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.During his May meeting with Mr. Phuc, Mr. Trump refrained from censuring Vietnam for its mounting crackdown on dissent, which has resulted in the arrests of dozens of bloggers, religious leaders and activists.In a Nov. 7 letter, 20 members of the House of Representatives, from both parties, called for Mr. Trump to raise \u201cVietnam\u2019s dismal human rights record\u201d when he sees Mr. Quang on Saturday.Five decades ago, Mr. Trump was exempted from military service during the Vietnam War with a bone spur diagnosis. On Friday, in between events at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Mr. Trump met with American veterans of the Vietnam war and signed a proclamation commemorating the conflict\u2019s 50th anniversary.\u201cEach of you, under the most difficult conditions, did what you had to do, and you did it well,\u201d Mr. Trump told the veterans. \u201cThey\u2019re brave, they\u2019re strong, they\u2019re great patriots, and we just want to thank you and all of the thousands and thousands, and all of the people that served with you and in all of the other wars.\u201dHe said his administration was working to secure the return of 1,253 veterans still missing in Vietnam and that it \u201cwill not rest\u201d until they are brought home.The president\u2019s first contact with Vietnam was on land contaminated by the United States military half a century ago.Danang\u2019s airport is on the site of an old American air base where barrels of the defoliant Agent Orange were once stored and mixed. Dioxin, a toxic contaminant, seeped into the ground and nearby water sources.Since then, families living in the area have experienced higher rates of children with birth defects, most of which render them severely disabled. Nationwide, the Vietnamese Red Cross estimates that three million Vietnamese have been damaged by dioxin poisoning, either from their parents\u2019 exposure or from the polluted environments themselves.After decades of rejecting any link between dioxin and a multitude of cancers, birth defects and other physical ailments, the United States government in 2007 started to address the health and environmental consequences of the toxic compound in Vietnam.Five years later, the Americans began paying for the decontamination of the area around the Danang airport, where dioxin readings 365 times the safe level were found. By the middle of next year, the area should be entirely free of dioxin residue. (Efforts to fund further dioxin cleanups have caused budgetary wrangling between the State Department and the Pentagon.)\u201cOnly a few years ago a large portion of the Danang airport was a toxic waste site that posed grave risks to human health,\u201d said Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who has led the congressional effort to redress one of the world\u2019s most persistent chemical assaults on the environment.\u201cToday it is a fully functioning airport for a city of 1.3 million people,\u201d said Mr. Leahy, who visited Danang in 2014. \u201cThe fact that this very location is the site of the APEC summit, attended by the president of the United States, speaks volumes.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting from Danang, Vietnam, and Chau Doan from Hanoi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela Appoints General to Tighten Grip on Oil Industry", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 A day after President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro named a general to lead Venezuela\u2019s beleaguered state-owned oil company, analysts and opposition leaders on Monday described the appointment as a political move that threatened to worsen the country\u2019s misfortunes.Mr. Maduro announced on Sunday that Maj. Gen. Manuel Quevedo would assume control of Petroleos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, as well as of the oil ministry. As the government wrestles with declining production and crushing debt amid an unrelenting economic crisis, the president cast the appointment as an attack on rampant corruption that has bled Pdvsa of profits and undermined its operations.His opponents, however, described it as Mr. Maduro\u2019s latest effort to purge the company\u2019s leadership and consolidate control over the nation\u2019s vital oil industry. The Maduro administration has arrested about 50 people associated with Pdvsa in the past several months as it has pressed an anti-corruption campaign within the public oil sector.\u201cThe time for a new oil revolution has come,\u201d the president declared during a nationally televised broadcast.Opponents and some analysts said the appointment of General Quevedo, who was formerly the housing minister and has no known experience in the oil industry, appeared to be part of a strategy by the widely unpopular president to forestall dissatisfaction within his security forces. Left unchecked, that could threaten his grip on power.General Quevedo joins several current and retired military officials whom Mr. Maduro has named to leadership posts in his government, including a general who was put in charge of the Transportation Ministry on Sunday. General Quevedo replaces two civilians at the oil ministry.\u201cMaduro identifies the military as his security blanket, and his almost five years in office have been marked by the military progressively getting more and more goodies,\u201d said David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cHe\u2019s basically buying off the military.\u201dPutting General Quevedo in charge of Pdvsa, Mr. Smilde said, is \u201cthe maximum expression\u201d of this strategy, \u201cthe jewel in the crown.\u201dReuters reported on Monday that General Quevedo, who will be sworn in on Tuesday, planned to name more military officers to his senior management team.Jos\u00e9 Guerra, a member of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, said on Twitter that the appointment showed that the country \u201cis in bad hands, that there is no planning for important positions.\u201dThe state-owned company has lost some of its most experienced managers through firings, imprisonments and emigration in recent years, and some analysts said that the ceding of control to military officers might accelerate the flight of talent.The reshuffling at the top of Venezuela\u2019s energy sector came a week after Mr. Maduro\u2019s attorney general announced the arrest on corruption charges of the acting president and five senior executives at Citgo, the United States refining subsidiary of Pdvsa.The company has directed its employees to cut costs in half as it faces possible default on billions of dollars in bond debt.Shannon K. O\u2019Neil, a Latin America analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations, said, \u201cQuevedo\u2019s appointment can\u2019t be good for stopping the current production declines.\u201d\u201cWhat it does is ensure military loyalists are now in charge not just of food distribution but also now of oil \u2014 the two main levers of power in Venezuela\u2019s shrinking economy,\u201d she said. \u201cDespite Maduro\u2019s rhetoric, this choice was all about political power and control, not the revitalization of production.\u201dThe Maduro administration, seeking to ease Venezuela\u2019s dizzying economic crisis, is trying to restructure Venezuela\u2019s $63 billion in bonds, most of them issued by the government and Pdvsa. Debt payments have helped drain the government\u2019s coffers of foreign currency that might otherwise be used to import food, medicine and other critical imports.Once one of the leading oil producers in the world, Venezuela, despite having the largest oil reserves in the world, has seen its production levels plummet to 1.9 million barrels a day, down from 2.4 million barrels a year ago.Yet Pdvsa still accounts for nearly all of the country\u2019s export earnings and roughly half of government revenues.Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy Fails to Qualify for the World Cup, and a Nation Mourns", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Many tragedies have befallen Italy in the last 60 years. Dozens of governments have collapsed. Earthquakes and terrorism have shaken cities. The French started adding cream to carbonara.But the failure of the national soccer team on Monday night to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1958 seems to be taking a place in the pantheon of Italian disasters.Italy exited the last World Cup in the first round, a setback that had already prompted anxiety about the future of Italian soccer. But for a country that puts the game so central to its national identity, Monday night\u2019s humiliation prompted an existential crisis.Cultural commentators said the result at the San Siro stadium in Milan reflected the failure of Italian society to move forward into modernity. It resulted from the rot and corruption in the Italian Football Federation, they said. Some politicians blamed immigration.Most of the front pages used the anguished expression of the 39-year-old goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who looked up to the sky with Job-like woe as the final whistle blew, to illustrate the nation\u2019s pain. The legendary keeper, who played a central role in Italy\u2019s World Cup victory in 2006, retired from the national team after the match, his 175th appearance in 20 years.\u201cTime goes by, and it\u2019s cruel, but that\u2019s how it is,\u201d he said as he fought back tears in remarks after the game. In a subsequent interview to the Italian state broadcaster RAI, the Juventus captain said he had sought not to cry in front of Italian children watching at home because he wanted them to dream about playing for the national team.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe failed at something that also means something on a social level.\u201dThe coach of Italy, Gian Piero Ventura, whose job looks precarious with officials and most of the country already calling for his head, reflected what many see as a national allergy to accountability. \u201cThe apocalypse is not a child only of tonight,\u201d he said after the game, declining to resign.As Italian websites exploded with Ikea-inspired Sweden jokes, including step-by-step instructions for Italians on how to make a \u201cg\u00f6l,\u201d some politicians tried to exploit the frustration.Financial analysts projected a loss of revenue to the national team of 100 million euros, or about $116 million, because of the failure to qualify for the World Cup.\u201cThere will be economic consequences to this defeat,\u201d Elisa Simoni, a left-leaning member of Parliament, told the news channel Sky TG24. Others suggested that Italy\u2019s victory at the World Cup in 2006 had contributed to a spike in employment and in the country\u2019s gross domestic product.Those days now seem far away.He added, with a statement characteristic of the day, that \u201centire generations have never known this tragic experience.\u201dItalian television offered blanket coverage of the debacle, sending reporters to Bari, Milan, Palermo, Rome and elsewhere to measure the impact of the national disaster.On a masochistic loop, TV channels played the lowlights from the match, including Italy\u2019s many missed chances and the players falling to the ground at the end. One commentator called it \u201cthe saddest night in the history of Italian soccer.\u201dOn the radio, usually esoteric news programs dedicated time to Italy\u2019s failure. It was not just about sport, expert after expert made clear, but about culture, and how Italy paled in comparison to Germany, \u201cwhich follows the rules.\u201dAnalysts noted that the Italian talent pool, once an ocean, had shrunk to a puddle because of competition from other sports. Maurizio Crosetti, a sportswriter for La Repubblica, said that the soccer disaster mirrored a crisis in Italian society. \u201cThis shows us anthropologically, culturally, how we have become, how we have been reduced,\u201d he wrote.The Italian government announced on Tuesday more growth in the economy this year, but that glimmer of good news was eclipsed by the prospect of a World Cup without Italy.Luca Lotti, the Italian sports minister, was among those seeking a silver lining. \u201cWe need to exploit this obviously negative occasion as an opportunity to rebuild Italian soccer,\u201d he told reporters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Haste on Tax Measures May Leave a Trail of Loopholes", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the rush to \u201cget it done\u201d \u2014 particularly on the business side, where the most sweeping changes are planned \u2014 is alarming tax specialists who warn that new and unforeseen complexity, loopholes and glitches could come back to haunt tax collectors and taxpayers.\u25a0 Rules designed to prevent highly paid doctors, lawyers and other service providers from cashing in on new benefits aimed at small businesses can be easily circumvented.Even those who applaud the aim of reducing the corporate tax rate and transforming the way global profits are taxed worry that specific provisions will miss the mark.Republican leaders, responding to political pressure to move quickly, defend the process, saying Congress has held dozens of hearings on tax reform in recent years.Tax bills, by nature complex, are shaped by a galaxy of competing pressures. And withholding details until the final vote as a way of shielding the legislation from special interests is not a new strategy.We\u2019re asking for your help to identify loopholes, unintended consequences or errors in the Senate and House tax proposals.Yet several veterans of previous tax battles argue what is different this time is the mix of breakneck speed and enormous scope.The Congressional Budget Office said on Monday that Congress\u2019s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has not yet had enough time to analyze the full economic impact of the proposals.Because the switch could end up encouraging American companies to move even more profits offshore to avoid paying any domestic income tax, both the House and Senate versions of the bill impose rules to deter most multinationals with annual revenues of more than $100 million from exploiting such tactics.But the effort to catch the giants under the new territorial system sets a financial bar that small and medium-size businesses can limbo under. Mr. Shay said accounting firms were likely to start marketing off-the-shelf tax shelters allowing companies to set up foreign offices in low-tax countries like Bermuda or Luxembourg to shrink their tax bills.\u201cThey\u2019re just opening us up to the next round of tax shelters on the international side,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the I.R.S., underfunded as it is, isn\u2019t going to be able to check anything.\u201dMultinationals, though, could avoid some of the Gilti tax by shifting more tangible property like production and research facilities abroad.\u201cThere is not a single advantage this has, except for students of people like me, who will get paid more to figure out how to game the system,\u201d he said.Yet enacting a 20 percent corporate tax rate to take effect one year in advance while allowing investors to immediately deduct their expenses at 35 percent operates like a subsidy, and could encourage investing in money-losing projects simply for a tax gain.\u201cThat could lead to silly stuff where you have a loss before the tax, but a gain after the tax,\u201d Mr. Shaviro said.Other experts pointed to constantly shifting cost estimates of proposals that suddenly gained or lost tens of billions of dollars overnight.The shortcomings are fixable to some degree, critics say, but the Republican strategy of pushing through a bill without Democratic votes before the end of the year \u2014 on tax rules that take effect a few weeks later \u2014 will not leave sufficient time.To some supporters, though, that\u2019s the price of success.But there are always technical corrections to tax bills after they pass, Ms. Bernstein said, and retailers have been waiting so long for a corporate rate cut that they don\u2019t mind if it finally happens with an imperfect bill.\u201cIt\u2019s part of how the sausage is made, but it\u2019s better to make this sausage than cut it off,\u201d Ms. Bernstein said.An earlier version of this article described incorrectly a statement from the Congressional Budget Office. The office said that the Joint Committee on Taxation had not yet had enough time to analyze the full impact of the proposals, not that the office expected that it would be unable to analyze the bill before a vote.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTNatalie Kitroeff contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Dangerous Sprint Into the Future", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "To hear its executives tell it, Tesla is misunderstood because it is still perceived as a car manufacturer, when its goals are more complex and far-reaching. But at least some people have bought into these grand ambitions. This summer, Tesla\u2019s stock-market valuation at times rose above those of Ford and General Motors, and its worth exceeded $60 billion. It did not seem to matter to investors that the company had never made an annual profit, had missed its production targets repeatedly and had become enmeshed in controversy over its self-driving \u201cautopilot\u201d technologies, or that Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, had conceded that the value of his company, of which he owns about 22 percent, was \u201chigher than we have the right to deserve.\u201d Tesla was a headlong bet on the future, a huge wager on the idea of a better world. And its secretive Gigafactory was the arsenal for a full-fledged attack on the incumbent powers of the car and fossil-fuel industries. The factory would help validate Musk and his company\u2019s seriousness about leading humanity\u2019s turn to greener technologies, with a vision now encompassing solar roofing tiles and battery packs for home and industry. Most crucial, it involved producing millions of Tesla cars and trucks, all of which would be sleek, electric and self-driving.If ambitions were all it took, Tesla would be crowned the colossus of the global car industry. But rapidly accelerating new technologies have brought uncertainty as well. Automakers are encountering three destabilizing forces all at once: automation, electrification and sharing. And sizing up which companies will be the winners and losers in their wakes is in no way obvious. In terms of self-driving cars, it seems likely that long-established companies \u2014 General Motors and Ford, as well as BMW and Audi \u2014 will benefit from their substantial reserves of cash and deep manufacturing experience. Because these automakers can invest deeply in research (and spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy start-ups), they can remain competitive with companies less inherently cautious, like Tesla and Waymo, the spinoff of Google\u2019s self-driving projects.Tesla\u2019s goal has always been focused on going green, rather than creating the driverless future. (Its mission is emblazoned on its factory walls: \u201cTo accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.\u201d) Yet as the automobile industry settles on the consensus that self-driving cars are coming \u2014 their promise to improve safety and to help ride-sharing replace car ownership for many Americans propels their inevitability \u2014 Tesla finds itself in the midst of a contest to do both. This set of challenges should be enough for any company, especially one led by a chief executive whose time is compromised by other business commitments as a founder of a rocket company (SpaceX), a new tunneling operation (the Boring Company), a company planning a human-computer interface (Neuralink) and a nonprofit focused on the dangers of artificial intelligence (OpenAI). But Tesla has given itself a few others too. One is to essentially reinvent modern manufacturing processes at the Gigafactory. Yet another is to create the first mass-market electric car ever. In the meantime, a company that has never made much profit needs to somehow figure out how to do so \u2014 that is, to put itself in the black before financial losses and missed deadlines curdle any hope that Tesla inspires, among customers or stockholders, into skepticism.Still, the Gigafactory is considerably more than a battery factory: It\u2019s the physical embodiment of various technological breakthroughs the company \u2014 which just manufactured its 250,000th car \u2014 is trying to bring to its cars and energy-storage systems. Tesla makes motors here for its new Model 3 car, for instance, which are then trucked to its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., 240 miles away. When we went inside, after a labyrinthine walk through offices and up and down stairways, we reached a rapidly moving automated factory line, where batteries were being installed into Powerwalls and Powerpacks \u2014 the residential and industrial units that store energy collected from solar panels (or any electrical generator). Later in the month, devices like these would make their way to Puerto Rico, where Tesla rebuilt the power infrastructure for a children\u2019s hospital, and southern Australia, where the company is involved in a vast public project to shore up the country\u2019s electrical grid. \u201cWe think of this building as a product, because it is a product,\u201d my guide told me as we walked alongside a production line. Every machine had been scrutinized, every inch mapped out, every efficiency contemplated. Tesla had taken the highly unusual step of setting up a separate entity to take full control of the building\u2019s design, engineering and construction, reflecting Tesla\u2019s D.I.Y. ethos to achieve levels of vertical ownership and quality control that its executives believe are unreachable otherwise. The company had even concocted its own Tesla blend of coffee to serve near its cafeterias. \u201cIf we cannot get exactly what we want from the world,\u201d one executive told me, \u201cthen we have to go do it ourselves.\u201dTesla\u2019s grand plans in many respects depend on how much innovation the company can bring to the process of battery making. If the Gigafactory succeeds in reducing costs \u2014 one battery-industry analyst, Sam Jaffe, the director at Cairn Energy Research Advisors, told me he thinks the company should be able to drive down the price of its cells by 30 percent \u2014 multiple dividends will accrue to Tesla. Cheaper batteries mean more than cheaper cars. They mean Tesla can put larger battery packs into cars for the same cost, increasing the vehicles\u2019 range, power and appeal compared with the competition. At the same time, they could make its home energy-storage systems more efficient. Tesla could also gain an advantage in the race to produce autonomous vehicles, or A.V.s. The electric vehicles, or E.V.s, that Tesla wants to make autonomous have zero emissions. If self-driving cars go on rotation, say, in Uber and Lyft fleets, they could run 24-7, possibly leading to more cars on the road. \u201cOne of the concerns about automation is that it\u2019s going to drastically increase the miles we drive,\u201d Stephen Zoepf, the executive director at the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, told me. \u201cSo if we expect as a society that we\u2019re going to be driving a lot more, we obviously want to mitigate the environmental impact.\u201dAt the Gigafactory, J.B. Straubel, a Tesla founder and the company\u2019s chief technology officer, recounted the plant\u2019s origin story. In 2012, he did a back-of-the-envelope calculation and realized that if Tesla were to sell something on the order of 500,000 cars a year, it would require the world\u2019s entire output of lithium-ion batteries at the time. \u201cWe realized, holy crap, this means we need a huge factory,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause there was no way to do this just by putting in an order with some cell company and have them ship a few more.\u201d His projections were not far off. When we met in September, orders for the Model 3, which began production in midyear and has been billed as the company\u2019s first mass-market car, were around 455,000 through July, suggesting that the demand for E.V.s is far larger than any of the traditional automakers ever imagined. In the future, Straubel told me, Tesla plans to put up many more Gigafactories around the world, \u201cones that are actually quite a lot bigger than this one\u201d \u2014 and it would construct those itself too. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a big building that\u2019s full of equipment,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea here of the machine that builds the machine, and it\u2019s really true. This place is the embodiment of that.\u201dThe impression he wanted me to have, I think, was that Tesla, once it gets this prodigious machine humming, will become robotically unstoppable at cranking out smaller machines, a great big clean-energy perpetual-motion device. At the same time, the company\u2019s executives, from Straubel and Musk on down, were urging potential customers not to view each Tesla product in isolation but as parts of an ecosystem. The Tesla customer could soon use Tesla solar roof tiles during the day to charge up a Tesla Powerwall unit, filled with Gigafactory-made batteries \u2014 at night the Powerwall could in turn recharge the Tesla sedan. Perhaps the customer very much liked to drive? In that case, he or she might occasionally stop at one of the hundreds of Tesla \u201csupercharger\u201d stations in cities or along highways. Or maybe the owner didn\u2019t like to drive at all and preferred to be driven automatically. Tesla would soon straddle our peculiar moment, the transitional era where humans begin to take their hands off their machines. \u201cEvery car made since October of last year,\u201d Musk promised in early August, \u201cis capable of full autonomy, we believe.\u201dField quickly showed me the controls. There weren\u2019t many except for a few dials on the steering wheel. The screen to its right served as the car\u2019s dashboard. \u201cThis looks forward to an era of autonomy,\u201d Field explained, \u201cbut it\u2019s also simpler and easier to manufacture.\u201d That meant cheaper too, which was crucial: Tesla had concluded that every dollar saved on the cost of making the car would mean 100 more families could buy it in a year. As we drove through Palo Alto, the car was nimble and responsive, with the same kind of leaping acceleration that characterizes the Model S. But it took some time to get used to checking the screen to my right for my speed and autopilot settings. Field told me his team had concluded that it would be natural and intuitive for a younger generation. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting when you put young people in the car,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the way all kids navigate technology.\u201d It\u2019s also possible that the kids might do more navigating, or giving the car orders, than driving. Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla\u2019s design chief, later told me that in creating the car\u2019s interior, he faced the question of making a car that was affordable and stylish but also relevant for a future era. There was vigorous debate within the company about what to do if the Model 3 became truly autonomous. As time went on, von Holzhausen\u2019s group reasoned, this car would be driven less and would be driving more. Thus the decision to jettison dials and controls made sense, because the need for driver information would be reduced, and the central screen could mark routes and arrival times and double as an entertainment center. Those would be the essential tools. Or, as von Holzhausen put it, \u201cThe screen then became the hero of the vehicle.\u201dAll of Tesla\u2019s cars, including the Model 3, come with cameras and sensors; the sensors are small radar and ultrasonic devices situated around the car\u2019s exterior that could enable it, presuming the right software is eventually developed, to become self-driving. Because each Tesla car maintains a cellular connection, over-the-air improvements dispensed by the company are a regular feature \u2014 tweaking acceleration or braking capabilities through uploaded instructions, for instance. Sometimes the extent to which the company can improve or alter its cars\u2019 performance, even years after they left the factory, can be startling or unsettling, as was the case when Tesla temporarily extended the battery range for some drivers fleeing Hurricane Irma in Florida this summer. Self-driving, which Field assured me would ultimately come to pass with the right software and which Musk has repeatedly promoted to investors and customers, would allow Teslas to become something much more than they are. In the parlance of the Society of Automotive Engineers, which has quantified the capabilities a car must have to be considered self-driving, the vehicles will have nearly attained Level 5. This level denotes a safe and fully autonomous car that can operate in any place, and any conditions, without a driver.At the moment, Teslas are at Level 2. Their cameras, sensors and software support a more modest capability known as \u201cenhanced autopilot,\u201d which costs an additional $5,000 in a new Model S or Model 3. In certain road and weather conditions, the cars can regulate speed and braking in traffic, steer automatically, change lanes and parallel park autonomously. By some industry rankings, these features now help make Teslas among the safest cars on the road. But following the deadly crash of a Model S driver who was using autopilot in Florida in May 2016, the company reconfigured what the cars permit. When I tried the automated steering on my Model S during the drive from Reno to Palo Alto, for instance, the car chimed frequently in distress and warned me through a dashboard notice when I took my hands off the wheel for a few seconds. I\u2019d been informed that if this happened three times, the car would slow down, stop and rescind my autopilot privileges altogether. I didn\u2019t push it. Clearly, the car \u2014 and Tesla, too \u2014 still needed its driver.In the summer of 2016, Musk updated his vision for the company \u2014 \u201cMaster Plan, Part Deux.\u201d In the decade since Part 1, the acceptance of electric vehicles had grown to the point where some traditional carmakers, in a surprising turn, were beginning to speak of an inevitable transition to an era when all models were battery-powered. Entire countries (like China) and enormous markets (like California) were also considering eventual bans on internal-combustion engines. As E.V. technology seemed ascendant, a variety of factors outside the auto industry were creating real potential for self-driving vehicles: great gains in computer-processing power, cheaper hardware sensors, better mobile connectivity, advances in artificial intelligence and enhanced mapping software. In his updated master plan, Musk stated that every Tesla would now have self-driving capabilities and that the application of \u201cfleet learning\u201d \u2014 a variation on machine learning \u2014 would help the company someday deliver a car that was 10 times safer in self-driving mode than when controlled by a human.Musk also explained a new fundamental goal of the company. Tesla, he said, wanted to \u201cenable your car to make money for you when you aren\u2019t using it.\u201d In other words, any new Tesla could in due time be part of a sharing network, able to taxi strangers around while its owner worked, slept or did whatever. Most Americans\u2019 cars stay parked about 95 percent of the time. A Tesla would not. In the same way that Tesla\u2019s electric drive train made the American car more efficient, the Tesla network would make the total utilization of the vehicle more efficient, too.App-based sharing networks for cars already exist: These companies \u2014 Turo and Getaround, for instance \u2014 are different from, say, Zipcar, because they depend on peer-to-peer communications to arrange for rentals. In essence, they function like mobile Airbnbs, and in some cases have drawn the ire of users in the wake of driver crashes and insurance issues. A Tesla network would push this concept much further, involving perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of cars, all of them already connected to the internet. Yet such a business network, one Tesla executive told me, most likely wouldn\u2019t succeed unless Tesla\u2019s cars were fully autonomous. Any concerns about insurance and lending a car to a risky driver would disappear, he argued, if autonomous driving proves to be much safer than manual driving. Just as important, autonomy makes irrelevant the problem of getting the car to where it\u2019s needed next \u2014 it can be sent wherever it needs to go via mobile app. What\u2019s crucial here is that the Tesla network, if it becomes functional, can defray the cost of an electric car like the Model 3, which is billed as Tesla\u2019s affordable car but can easily surpass $50,000 with various options. If your car is making money for you when you\u2019re not using it, it effectively becomes a tool that uses the virtues of A.V.s to promote the market adoption of E.V.s.Over the course of several months, I often asked people at Tesla, as well as those working on autonomous technologies elsewhere, how far away the self-driving future might be. There was no solid consensus beyond somewhere between two and five years. I tended to believe that the timeline might extend much further and would depend on how tightly we regulate such vehicles and how we agree to define autonomy. Does it mean interstate driving on a sunny day? Or driving within a dedicated area on city streets? Is it a Level 5 overnight trip through heavy rain from Boston to Washington? A driverless taxi pickup on a crowded street under partial construction \u2014 orange cones, backhoes, chaos \u2014 as a nightclub lets out? Part of the debate concerns hardware and whether the collection of sensors that automotive engineers now build into their A.V.s can collect enough data to create a fully autonomous car. These sensors generally include radar, cameras and Lidar, the expensive laser-based technology that Tesla has so far declined to use. Many other A.V. researchers consider it essential. Lidar uses light waves, rather than radio waves, to map and \u201cread\u201d a car\u2019s environs.Musk has promised that before the end of this year, a Tesla vehicle will drive itself coast to coast completely on autopilot. A number of competitors \u2014 especially Waymo and General Motors \u2014 seem to be closing in on similarly ambitious goals. But it\u2019s worth noting that no Level 5 car has ever been publicly deployed, and it\u2019s doubtful one even exists; the coast-to-coast trip on autopilot, Musk suggested, wouldn\u2019t yet be an instance where a driver could, say, go to sleep at the wheel. What\u2019s more, no Level 4 car, where the vehicle is self-driving under certain weather and geographical conditions, has been put in regular service, either. In fact, while driver-assistance tools like autopilot can greatly reduce crash rates, no company or researcher has ever demonstrated that a robotic automobile can consistently operate in the everyday world more safely than a car with a human driver.An executive close to Musk told me that his boss believes that creating a true A.V. is a \u201csolvable\u201d problem, one probably less difficult than others he has encountered in various business endeavors \u2014 for instance, creating cheap, reusable rockets for SpaceX, his other major company, or pushing Tesla\u2019s Model S to such unlikely success. This may indeed prove true. But unlike other tech innovations, the development of driverless cars cannot count on something like Moore\u2019s Law, which has projected a doubling of computing power at regular intervals and has allowed Silicon Valley entrepreneurs a clear window into the future. Based on conversations with engineers on the A.V. front lines, the most difficult problem is rigging cars with sensors and software that can take a rich, clear, picture of every element in the surrounding environment \u2014 people, bikes, signs, obstacles \u2014 and then algorithmically choreograph the future.This challenge is as arduous for Tesla as it is for engineers everywhere working to solve it. And yet the exigencies of Tesla\u2019s business model add an additional layer of complexity. To reach its sustainability goals and become profitable, the company must make lots of cars that are electric and sporty and increasingly affordable; meanwhile, to prepare for the future, Tesla has to build cars that eventually won\u2019t need us. Some of the most experienced researchers working on A.V.s believe that these are two separate and possibly irreconcilable ambitions and that it makes more sense to focus on a pure driverless car, even if it proves to be a very expensive proposition at first, rather than follow Tesla\u2019s incrementalist policy, which would involve rolling out software on a regular basis until the driver does less and less and finally nothing at all. With the second approach, one Silicon Valley engineer said, \u201cthe market pressures that are going to be applied to those technologies mean that you\u2019re not going to climb up the safety and reliability curve\u201d to build a true A.V. Keeping the vehicle affordable is in constant tension with making the vehicle autonomous. Musk\u2019s optimism alone can\u2019t change that.Musk declined my interview requests over the course of several months. By early November, the number of Model 3 cars coming out of the factory had fallen far short of what Musk had promised, the company\u2019s stock price had taken a nose-dive and there appeared to be serious software and robotic glitches at the Gigafactory. Musk was said to be too busy to talk, which did not always square with his social-media postings: jokes, poems, photos of tunnels he was digging, links to stories about the dangers of artificial intelligence and, in one instance, footage of a camping excursion on the roof of the Gigafactory.The company\u2019s evasiveness and secrecy extended to self-driving cars, a subject it was unwilling to discuss in any detail. One Tesla engineer I spoke with, who works on autopilot systems, maintained that the company\u2019s camera and sensory hardware will prove good enough to get his team where it wants to go, which as a near-term goal means cars with a self-driving capability that is twice as good as a human driver (rather than 10 times as good, per the second master plan). By November, Musk was telling investors that the actual goal was to get the system simply on a par with a human driver and that that might require a more powerful computer in the cars, which Tesla would swap in free if necessary. Some customers have already paid $3,000 for a Tesla \u201cself-driving\u201d package (on top of the $5,000 for \u201cenhanced autopilot\u201d), based on Musk\u2019s assurances that the new cars have all the hardware necessary and will be autonomous once regulations and functional software are worked out.There\u2019s no clear indication of whether these efforts are on track, and in the past year, several engineers who ran Tesla\u2019s autopilot unit have left the company. In early October, Scott Miller, an executive involved with General Motors\u2019 self-driving efforts, charged publicly that Musk was \u201cfull of crap\u201d for claiming that his cars could offer self-driving capabilities with their current hardware. His assertions echo those of some other Tesla critics I spoke with: Without Lidar, or a more expensive hardware approach, Musk\u2019s cars may be at a significant disadvantage. Indeed, several people familiar with the company\u2019s A.V. work viewed its self-driving approach as a perilous one, given that there is no definitive way to predict how long it could take Tesla to satisfy the promises made to customers. In the best case, if A.I. and software breakthroughs ultimately transform cars like the Model 3 into self-driving vehicles, Musk will have pulled off something that perhaps seems impossible today. In the worst case, hundreds of thousands of owners will have cars that won\u2019t achieve the status of true A.V.s and can only hope that the sharing network of the master plan will someday become a reality.Tesla\u2019s setbacks, Musk noted in November, shouldn\u2019t eclipse the fact that the company has already grown faster by some measures than Ford when it rolled out the Model T in the early 1900s. He takes a longer view of his business than Wall Street analysts. In a recent TED interview, while discussing his plans for cities on Mars, he argued that it\u2019s a mistake to assume that technology gets better as time goes on. \u201cIt does not automatically improve,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade.\u201d He cited the Egyptian pyramids and Roman aqueducts and how the knowledge to build them was lost for hundreds, or even thousands, of years afterward. The relevance is striking in a time when the federal government would rather subsidize the growth of the coal and fossil-fuel industries than renewable energy and electric cars.Long before anyone saw Tesla as a legitimate player in the auto industry, Musk also appears to have understood that in taking chances that no established carmaker would, Tesla could be an innovative force to quicken our slow, plodding progress in transportation. Imagine Tesla didn\u2019t exist, Steve Jurvetson told me. \u201cWhat would the world look like? I have this sinking suspicion it wouldn\u2019t look that different than 10 years ago. A bunch of hybrid cars. A bunch of noise about hydrogen vehicles. You know, I don\u2019t think the world would look anything like today \u2014 where entire nations are saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to stop making gas cars.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe company\u2019s impact, real and potential, is all the more surprising considering that Musk has staked Tesla\u2019s success on the industrial equivalent of a shoestring, lacking the resources of established carmakers. He has used customer revenue, his own wealth, venture capital, bank and government loans, investments by other automakers and the American stock and debt markets to effectively fund a multibillion-dollar research-and-development project. In that way, he has led the industry to the start of a new era. And now his company, hindered by debilitating manufacturing bottlenecks and its extravagant promises of self-driving, is poised to find out whether, in laying the groundwork for an electric and autonomous future, he took one risk too many.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why \u2018Made in America\u2019 Is Stitched Into the Law, but Not the Uniforms", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s push to \u201cbuy American\u201d has been a key initiative of his administration, and Mr. Trump speaks frequently about ensuring that the federal government is buying American products.So it might come as a surprise that the uniforms of those Secret Service agents that protect and surround him every day are probably made outside the United States, most likely in Mexico.As a result, over roughly the past three years, more Secret Service uniforms have been made in Mexico than in any other country \u2014 including the United States. The same goes for uniforms procured for Transportation Security Administration workers. The majority of uniforms for Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are also made outside the United States, in countries like El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico and Cambodia.\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t have much impact at all,\u201d Kimberly Gianopoulos, the director of the Government Accountability Office\u2019s international affairs and trade team, said of the Kissell Amendment.The findings illustrate the difficulties of trying to bend trade rules to benefit domestic industries in a global economy where layers of international agreements can thwart those efforts.Many of the free trade agreements the United States entered into to gain access to markets abroad also prevent governments from discriminating against foreign products. And the global nature of supply chains also makes it difficult to find affordable products manufactured solely within the United States, since a product\u2019s components can cross borders multiple times before completion.According to the report, Homeland Security officials said that they probably could source most of their items from the United States, but that cutting out foreign countries could add 50 to 150 percent to the purchase price \u2014 an extra expense taxpayers may not want to bear.Channeling more business to domestic companies is a primary economic goal of the Trump administration. Yet while made-in-America provisions often garner political points, they can be hard to implement.The Trump administration is also pushing for stricter rules surrounding government contracts in its renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.The United States has proposed limiting the access Canadian and Mexican companies have to federal contracts under Nafta.Nafta partners have protested the proposal, with Canadian officials arguing that it would give Canada and Mexico less access to United States government procurement than much smaller nations, like Bahrain.Some economists and industry analysts question whether trade protections aimed at boosting American businesses, including tariffs on imported products, are effective in an age of global competition.Matt Priest, the president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, said that relatively high trade barriers on imported footwear, like the tariffs charged on imports, have not saved his industry from offshoring. The United States \u201ccontinues to charge these shoe taxes to protect an industry that isn\u2019t here, and consumers end up footing the bill,\u201d he said.But Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said that even though protections for American manufacturing might increase costs, taxpayers are typically willing to bear that burden.\u201cThere are a lot of places where we could substantially cut costs, but in a lot of cases when you cut costs, you\u2019re cutting jobs as well,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cThese companies are the last stand for footwear and apparel jobs in the United States.\u201dThe Kissell Amendment, the focus of the Government Accountability Office report, was passed in 2009 to help a domestic textile industry that was reeling. For decades, clothing and textile manufacturing had been slowly moving offshore, to take advantage of lower labor costs in Central America and Asia. The financial crisis accelerated that shift, tipping many factories with razor-thin profit margins into bankruptcy.American textile production plummeted to $46 billion in 2009 from $71 billion in 2006, according to the Government Accountability Office. Between 2005 and 2016, the American apparel, leather and textile manufacturing industry lost a quarter of its workers.Like a much older law, the Berry Amendment, which requires the Department of Defense to buy American food, clothing and other products, the Kissell Amendment tried to help domestic industry by directing the Department of Homeland Security to buy uniforms, body armor, tents and other fabric items from domestic sources.But according to the report, the amendment did not have its intended effect.It is a vivid demonstration of why some in the Trump administration criticize trade pacts and the World Trade Organization for staying the hand of the United States government. Of course, the United States entered into these agreements willingly, often at the behest of American companies who were pushing for access to foreign markets.In total, only about 42 percent of uniforms ordered by the Department of Homeland Security between October 2014 and June 2017 came from the United States, according to the report. About 30 percent came from Mexico, and an additional 16 percent came from Honduras and El Salvador.Advertisement"}

And hope, as we do, that efforts now underway by state and local governments and by private businesses to control emissions and move the United States to a cleaner energy future will make up for Mr. Trump\u2019s indifference.We\u2019ve been here before. In the George W. Bush administration, government officials doctored scientific reports, Vice President Dick Cheney stacked the top ranks of government with friends of the fossil fuel industry, and the president himself rejected a climate agreement adopted in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, as \u201cfatally flawed\u201d because, he said, it would damage the economy.Mr. Bush made many of the same flawed arguments that Mr. Trump is making.

{"Headline": "\u2018We Are Everywhere\u2019: How Ethiopia Became a Land of Prying Eyes", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFENDIKA, Ethiopia \u2014 When he is away from his fields, Takele Alene, a farmer in northern Ethiopia, spends a lot of his time prying into the personal and political affairs of his neighbors.He knows who pays taxes on time, who has debts and who is embroiled in a land dispute. He also keeps a sharp lookout for thieves, delinquents and indolent workers.But he isn\u2019t the village busybody, snooping of his own accord. Mr. Alene is a government official, whose job includes elements of both informant and enforcer. He is responsible for keeping the authorities briefed on potential rabble-rousers and cracking down on rule breakers.Even in a far-flung hamlet like Fendika, few of whose 400 or so residents venture to the nearest city, let alone ever travel hundreds of miles away to the capital, Addis Ababa, the government is omnipresent.In this case, its presence is felt in the form of Mr. Alene, a short, wiry man wearing a turquoise turban and plastic sandals. As a village leader, he said, his duties include serving as judge, tax collector, legal scribe for the illiterate and general keeper of the peace.But one of his most important roles is to watch who among the villagers opposes the government and its policies, including a top-priority program encouraging farmers to use fertilizer. When a neighbor refused to buy some, Mr. Alene pointed a gun at him until he gave in. He has had others jailed for a similar offense.This army of on-the-ground operatives, who push the government\u2019s policies, help purvey its propaganda and act as lookouts, is especially valuable at a time when the country is being rocked by protests over access to jobs and land, and a failure to advance democracy.Mr. Alene\u2019s loyalty to the governing party has earned him handsome rewards. He was given the title of \u201cmodel farmer\u201d and has been granted plots of land and other benefits like farm animals, a cellphone, the gun he turned on his neighbor and a radio, which he keeps under lock and key.\u201cI am No. 1,\u201d he exclaimed recently in the village pub, sitting against a wall stacked with sacks of fertilizer and drinking home-brewed beer poured into what used to be a can of chickpeas. \u201cI feel great happiness,\u201d he added.Ethiopia is unlike many countries in Africa, where the power of the state often reaches beyond the capital in name only. More organized, more ambitious and more centrally controlled than a lot of governments on the continent, the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front (a coalition of four regional parties), which controls this mountainous, semiarid but spectacularly beautiful land of just over 100 million people, intends to transform it into a middle-income country by 2025.Achieving that goal, in a country that 30 years ago was a byword for famine, means realizing a plan of rapid industrial and agricultural growth modeled on the success stories of Asia. Ethiopia is relying on state-driven development rather than the Western-style liberalization that in the 1980s and 1990s hurt many economies across Africa, like Ghana and the Ivory Coast.It also means, in the government\u2019s view, exercising control down to the level of neighborhoods in cities and villages in the countryside.Many Western donors have praised Ethiopia for its advances in health, education and development, all made in a single generation. The government recently opened Africa\u2019s largest industrial park, with plans for more, and is building what is expected to be the continent\u2019s biggest hydroelectric dam.But the government\u2019s economic agenda often goes hand in hand with control over people through party membership and surveillance, a strategy modeled on China, somewhere officials have gone regularly for how-to training, according to former government members.\u201cEveryone is suspicious of each other,\u201d said Ermias Legesse, an ex-government minister who left the country in 2011. He spent three weeks in the Chinese countryside in 2009, he said, learning about party indoctrination.\u201cYou can\u2019t trust your mother, brother, sister,\u201d he said about his homeland. \u201cYou can imagine what kind of social fabric is formed out of such a system.\u201dParty members across the country are assigned five people to monitor, whether in households, schools, universities, businesses or prisons. Called \u201cone-to-five,\u201d it is a system so pervasive, Mr. Legesse said, that it even existed in the Ministry of Communications, which he headed.\u201cThe one-to-five\u2019s major objective is to spy on people,\u201d Mr. Legesse said.Being a party member and a participant in those networks gives you jobs, promotions and even access to microfinance, some of which is funded by international institutions, Mr. Legesse said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re against the system, you\u2019ll likely be miserable.\u201dThe government network is so entrenched that many in the country, which suffered years of repression under the previous, Marxist government led by Mengistu Haile Mariam, which fell in 1991, are deeply suspicious of talking to strangers and avoid discussing politics for fear of who might be listening.\u201cThey are the person you least expect,\u201d a shopkeeper in Addis Ababa said in a low voice, his eyes darting around the store. Like many Ethiopians, he asked not to be identified because he was afraid of the consequences of talking openly to a foreign journalist. \u201cIt could be the shoeshine boy or the waiter serving you coffee.\u201dBecause most Ethiopians are struggling financially, they are easily brought into the network, said Tsedale Lemma, an Ethiopian journalist currently living in Germany, adding that teachers who joined got salary raises, businesspeople got easier access to loans and high-school students got pocket money. \u201cEthiopians think this is shameful,\u201d Ms. Lemma said, even though they found it difficult to resist. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral rock bottom.\u201dHabtamu Ayalew Teshome, a prominent opposition leader who was tortured for months and jailed for two years, discovered that even in prison, he was assigned to a group with a leader who watched his activities.Twice a day, this monitor would organize meetings, and Mr. Teshome said that when he refused to participate, he was denied communication with his lawyers and family. He was repeatedly beaten, mentally tortured and taken to solitary confinement for months, he said. \u201cWe are the police, we are the prosecutor, we are the judge,\u201d a prison commander told him. \u201cWe are everywhere.\u201dSpying is not the only purpose of the one-to-five system. It is also a way to recruit new members and push policy objectives.The ruling party has \u201ca great will and vision to transform the country and realizes that it needs to mobilize the grass roots in order to succeed,\u201d said Lovise Aalen, a political scientist and longtime observer of Ethiopia at Chr. Michelsen Institute, an independent research organization in Norway. \u201cIt\u2019s impressive, but it also exhibits a very authoritarian state present on the ground to an extent unseen in Ethiopian history.\u201dIn rural areas, \u201cone-to-fives\u201d allow a designated model farmer, like Mr. Alene, to teach best practices, including the merits of using fertilizer, and be rewarded when output increases.Village women also organize themselves into groups to prevent other women from falling into prostitution or to teach each other about health issues.Some of this has yielded positive results, government officials say. Ethiopia\u2019s economy has been growing at 10 percent for more than a decade, according to official figures. Agricultural output has risen dramatically, they say, although critics say that has not been enough to offset the food aid that Ethiopia continues to receive.Khalid Bomba, a former investment banker who leads the government\u2019s Agricultural Transformation Agency, said \u201cone-to-fives\u201d were all about empowerment. \u201cIt\u2019s participatory deep democracy,\u201d he said.The networks have played a significant role in expanding membership to about seven million, mostly in the countryside, in the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front, the ruling party that critics say is controlled by Tigrayans, an ethnic group that makes up just 6 percent of the population.Fendika, where Mr. Alene keeps watch, was largely insulated from riots last year, partly thanks to his diligent work of converting half the village, made up of ethnic Amharas, to the ruling party.\u201cEven in these violent times, this kebele has been peaceful,\u201d Mr. Alene said recently, referring to his village. When a person makes trouble, \u201cwe know who he is,\u201d he added. \u201cWe send the elders, the priest, to try to sort it out with him or the group and persuade them not to do anymore wrongdoing. If that doesn\u2019t work out, we report to the police.\u201dMr. Alene, who has been a member of the ruling party since it swept to power in 1991, recruits villagers to join. He even recruited the local priest, who in turn, has preached to his congregation about the party\u2019s virtues.\u201cWhen I\u2019m recruiting, I tell them, \u2018If you\u2019re a member, you can have different rights,\u2019\u201d Mr. Alene said. \u201cThe right to ask questions, the right to have whatever they want.\u201dFor his efforts, he owns three hectares of land (most farmers have less than one) and livestock.He has enough savings, unlike many other farmers, to send all nine of his children to university. Being a party member is \u201cvery good,\u201d he said, though he added with candor: \u201cYou have to stand with the government. There\u2019s no choice.\u201dMr. Alene had made amends with the neighbor he forced to buy fertilizer at gunpoint, and the two men recently sat next to each other at the village pub. The neighbor, who is missing a leg, clucked disapprovingly as Mr. Alene talked about serving the community.\u201cThe kebele is not good! It doesn\u2019t support the poor people. He\u2019s lying!\u201d the neighbor finally shouted, hobbling furiously out the door.Also in the pub was the village priest, Adugna Asema, draped in a traditional white cloak and wearing a white turban, who said he encouraged congregants to join the party.\u201cI preach peace,\u201d he said, as he periodically stood up to bless villagers wandering into the pub with a large wooden cross.\u201cYou\u2019ll benefit in heaven and on earth,\u201d he tells them, \u201cif you join the party.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "30 Vaquita Porpoises Are Left. One Died in a Rescue Mission.", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a windy afternoon last weekend, Cynthia Smith was on a boat in the Gulf of California, searching for one of the rarest marine mammals in the world.Never before had a vaquita porpoise been successfully captured and cared for by humans. But Dr. Smith, a veterinarian with a group known as Vaquita CPR, knew that the porpoises \u2014 whose black-rimmed eyes and dark noses have earned them the moniker \u201cpanda of the sea\u201d \u2014 were likely to disappear without human intervention. Scientists estimate there are fewer than 30 vaquitas left in the wild. It was a last resort.When Dr. Smith and her team spotted a pair of porpoises, and managed to haul in the female, they were hopeful: the vaquita was calm, her vital signs promising. But soon after they moved her into a sea pen she began swimming too rapidly, then abruptly slowed down. By the time the veterinarians released the vaquita back into the wild, it was too late. \u201cShe was no longer breathing,\u201d Dr. Smith said. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t bring her back.\u201dIn the past five years, the vaquita population \u2014 which lives in only a sliver of water between Mexico\u2019s mainland and Baja California \u2014 has plummeted by 90 percent. Humans are to blame, but they are not even hunting for the vaquitas themselves.Mexico banned totoaba fishing in 1993, but it was only in 2015 \u2014 when vaquita numbers dwindled to about 100 \u2014 that the government also banned most gill nets, including those used for catching shrimp and other kinds of fish. The gill nets catch the totoaba, and also trap the vaquitas.Fishermen are still allowed to use a different type of net, intended for catching corvina fish, that is not supposed to pose a threat to the vaquitas. But because the corvina and totoaba fishing seasons overlap, fishermen can hide the totoaba nets beneath the corvina nets on their boats, said Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho, the director of Vaquita CPR. \u201cYou can use a corvina as a cover-up, and that\u2019s what happened,\u201d he said.\u201cIf you\u2019re out here on the water, you\u2019re not risking jail time to catch shrimp,\u201d said Dave Bader, a spokesman for Vaquita CPR.After the death of the captured vaquita, the scientists agreed to shut down the program. \u201cThe evidence today is vaquita are not good candidates for being protected in this way,\u201d Dr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201dThe scientists had hoped to keep the animals in captivity temporarily, and possibly even breed them, until gill nets were eliminated from their habitat. While any wild animal is expected to experience some stress when captured, the group had hoped the vaquita could cope with being handled. (Last month, the scientists released a vaquita calf they had pulled from the waters when they determined it was too young to be separated from its mother.)Other conservationists had been critical of the plan. \u201cI was telling them that this was going to happen, you\u2019re going to stress out the animals,\u201d said Paul Watson, the founder of the Sea Shepherd conservation group, which also works to protect vaquitas. \u201cThey are very elusive, they are very shy; you\u2019re going to kill one of them.\u201dMr. Crosta said that while he admired the work of the biologists, they couldn\u2019t possibly solve a problem \u201cthat starts in San Felipe and ends in a shop in China.\u201d The fate of the vaquita, he said, was \u201centirely in the hands of law enforcement.\u201dIn the past two years, Sea Shepherd and local groups have recovered more than 25,000 yards of gill nets from the gulf, weighing about 50 tons. Now that efforts to capture the vaquitas have failed, conservationists say hauling in the poachers\u2019 nets is the best bet to save the species from extinction.The Mexican government, conservationists say, also needs to crack down on illegal fishing, while providing sustainable alternatives for the community. Financial compensation from the government often never makes it into the hands of the fishermen, diverted by corruption, Mr. Crosta said.Local economies are an important consideration in conservation biology, Dr. Rojas-Bracho said. \u201cYou cannot save vaquita, and drive fishers to extinction.\u201dFollow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Torches and Hate on the March in Poland", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPoland\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic remarks at the event, but the more salient point was the ministry\u2019s defense of the demonstration as an outpouring of patriotism. The only people arrested were some pro-democracy counterprotesters.Even more troubling for Americans, and perhaps for the world, was that the words from an old Polish nationalist song that were the march\u2019s slogan \u2014 \u201cWe want God\u201d \u2014 were cited by President Trump to huge applause on his visit to Warsaw in July.Neo-fascist and white-supremacist groups have become more visible and assertive in Europe and the United States as a sense of alienation in a globalized world has taken hold, and as Middle Eastern and North African refugees have flooded Europe. But these extremists appear to feel energized and legitimized by nationalist and populist political leaders. Mr. Trump\u2019s mild condemnation of the white-supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville, Va., in August \u2014 he said their ranks included some \u201cvery fine people\u201d \u2014 could have only heartened the racists.The right-wing ruling party in Poland, Law and Justice, has wantonly assailed the courts and the news media while railing against immigrants, Islam, the European Union and liberals.These far-right passions have little basis in reality. Poland\u2019s economy has made great strides since Communism\u2019s fall, and unemployment is at a record low, 5.3 percent. As for purported threats to Polish identity, the country of 38 million has taken in a total of 1,474 asylum-seekers this year \u2014 18 of them from Syria, the rest mostly from Russia or Ukraine.The ugly nationalism sweeping through the Western world, and especially Central Europe, may be a passing phase in a difficult transition and a confusing world. It can be countered by common sense, as France showed in the resounding defeat of the far right last spring. But the disgusting slogans on display in Warsaw and the fictions and paranoia behind them must be relentlessly exposed for what they are and condemned, and the right-wing, populist governments that condone them must be censured, not embraced.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nafta Round Closes With Talks Bogged Down by Conflict", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 United States officials have tried in recent weeks to cool tensions over the North American Free Trade Agreement by extending the timetable for renegotiating the pact and asking top officials to sit out the current round of talks in Mexico City.But as the fifth round of talks concluded in the Mexican capital on Tuesday, tensions were still simmering, with Canada and Mexico telling the United States that it would make little headway with its current approach and Mexico firing its first warning shot with a tough counterproposal.Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, took aim at his Canadian and Mexican counterparts on Tuesday, saying \u201cthus far, we have seen no evidence that Canada or Mexico are willing to seriously engage on provisions that will lead to a rebalanced agreement. Absent rebalancing, we will not reach a satisfactory result.\u201dMr. Lighthizer said while some progress has been made to modernize Nafta, \u201cI remain concerned about the lack of headway. Our teams will be meeting again next month in Washington. I hope our partners will come to the table in a serious way so we can see meaningful progress before the end of the year.\u201dIn an indication of how far the talks have to go, Mr. Lighthizer will not meet again with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts until late January in Montreal, while lower-level negotiators will continue to hash out details in Washington next month.During a week of meetings in Mexico City, negotiators hammered out more technical details of the sweeping trade agreement, including those that govern digital trade, telecommunications, anti-corruption, customs procedures and health and safety standards for food.But the parties continued to clash on the most contentious issues, including mechanisms to resolve trade disputes and award government contracts, as well as so-called rules of origin, which govern the amount of a good that needs to be manufactured in North America in order to qualify for zero tariffs under Nafta.The United States has called for raising that threshold for the automobile industry to 85 percent, up from 62.5 percent previously. And it has asked for a new requirement that half of a car be manufactured solely in the United States \u2014 a provision at odds with the wishes of American automakers, who fear it will drive up their costs and make them less competitive globally.Canadian and Mexican officials did not make specific counterproposals to these requests. Instead, they presented data showing the harm the proposition would inflict on the auto sector and pressed the United States to explain its reasoning.That response frustrated the United States. A senior American official pushed back against the idea that the United States proposals were unworkable, saying the failure of Canada and Mexico to offer counterproposals had halted progress.On the topic of government procurement, Mexico answered a tough American proposal with one of its own \u2014 the first tit-for-tat exchange in the talks so far.The United States had proposed limiting the amount of American government contracts it offers to Canadian and Mexican companies by capping the level dollar-for-dollar to the total size of Canada and Mexico\u2019s much smaller markets.In response, Mexico floated the possibility of linking its government contracts to the size of deals that Mexican companies win in the United States, people familiar with the negotiations said. Because Mexican companies win few American contracts, that would significantly restrict the goods and services American companies supply to the Mexican government.Mois\u00e9s Kalach, a textile executive who represents Mexico\u2019s private sector in the talks, said that while progress was made on some technical issues, including telecommunications, the controversial issues remain.Speaking to reporters in Mexico City, Mr. Kalach said Mexico did present a counterproposal to the American request for a \u201csunset clause,\u201d under which Nafta would expire every five years unless the three countries agree to renew it. Mexican negotiators, supported by Canada, suggested that Nafta be reviewed every five years, but not automatically expire.Mr. Kalach added that Mexico has also rejected an American demand that would allow new seasonal restrictions on imports of Mexican produce, like tomatoes and avocados.Negotiating partners and industries that depend on the pact have been hoping the mounting concern would shift the debate and encourage the administration to roll back some of its proposals.In comments before the Canadian Parliament Tuesday, the foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said she was \u201cheartened\u201d to see dozens of members of Congress sign a letter about the benefits of Nafta.\u201cThis is a trading relationship that works for both sides,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we\u2019re starting to see a recognition of that among many Americans.\u201dStill, Canada and Mexico are hedging against the potential collapse of Nafta by pushing for trade agreements with new partners, including China. And during the president\u2019s recent trip to Asia, both countries indicated their willingness to move forward with an 11-country trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which Mr. Trump withdrew the United States this year.A move by Mr. Trump to withdraw from Nafta would set off a six-month process to terminate America\u2019s membership in the pact. Mr. Trump has described this action as a potential negotiating tool for persuading Canada and Mexico to accede to American demands.But it\u2019s unclear whether that tactic would work. People close to the discussions say Mexican officials would instead use those months to conclude trade negotiations with Brazil and the European Union.While Mr. Trump has said that no deal is preferable to the current one, economists argue abandoning Nafta could damage the United States.Elisabeth Malkin reported from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

It was another maddening journey of 20 miles that took at least twice as long as it should have, one more last straw. \u201cYou can\u2019t call it an express train if it stops a dozen times in the tunnel,\u201d Mr. Gilberto wrote on Twitter.The opposite happened.The number of people taking the subways dropped last year, and through the first nine months of this year is down by nearly 17 million over the same period in 2015.\u201cThe correlation between employment and ridership has broken down,\u201d Tim Mulligan, a senior vice president at New York City Transit, told members of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board this week.Why?Among many proposed explanations \u2014 more people working from home, spells of bad weather, competition from ride-hailing apps like Uber \u2014 one likely factor looms over all.The mass transit system has been failing. Transit crises have been recurring episodes in the saga of New York for more than a century. This one stands out because of how bad things have gotten in extraordinarily good times. Why this brilliant, infuriating and essential infrastructure is not thriving will be explored in upcoming About New York columns.The sharp ends of this generation\u2019s crisis have been emerging for nearly a decade.As ridership was growing, service was being cut. Fewer trains are running today than in 2007, and those that are running break down more often. More than 2,000 jobs in critical areas like repairing signals, tracks and cars were unfilled. By last year, subway cars that were bought in the 2000s were failing more frequently than ones that had gone into service 25 years earlier.Even simple measures to keep the city moving \u2014 like positioning medical help at busy stations to escort sick passengers off trains, or assigning platform conductors to wrangle crowds, or having extra trains on standby \u2014 were, until recently, curtailed.That the subways were, in 2017, on starvation rations in need of emergency cash would seem to defy gravity. Employment in the city has increased for 90 consecutive months, back to April 2010, the longest streak since at least 1950, according to Martin Kohli, the chief regional economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The public has shelled out 45 percent more money to use and support New York\u2019s mass transit over the last decade in the form of higher fares, tolls, taxes and fees. What looks like a bounty, though, is an illusion. Less and less of that goes to actual transit operations.Absurd as it is that transit users are, in effect, paying mortgages on houses for fish, those bills are but a fraction of a swelling mass of transit debt.In a few years, debt service will be one dollar in every five spent by the M.T.A., the comptroller estimates.By law, in a competition for budget money, debt service always comes in first. No such law protects riders. To repay the loans, money has been siphoned from service and maintenance.\u201cIt\u2019s as if the system is having a nervous breakdown, putting at risk all our city\u2019s great advantages: our economy, our environment and our mobility,\u201d said Gene Russianoff, the staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign and the city\u2019s leading transit advocate for four decades. \u201cAnd what did we expect? That generations of indifference would not exact a toll on the subways?\u201dRich Gilberto has moved from the north Bronx to Harlem, closer to work. \u201cPeople miss meetings, auditions, dates \u2014 potentially life-changing opportunities, because of unknown problems trapping you underground,\u201d Mr. Gilberto said.He has another way of putting more time in his day: he avoids the subway altogether. \u201cLuckily, I\u2019m in a comfortable enough financial situation where I can spring for an Uber or taxi,\u201d he said.An exodus of the exasperated.An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of the chief regional economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

{"Headline": "Accounting \u2018Gimmicks\u2019 in G.O.P.\u2019s Tax Overhaul Mask Higher Cost, Deficit Hawks Say", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Republicans march forward with their $1.5 trillion tax bill, budget experts are warning about what they say are an alarming array of accounting gimmicks intended to mask the true cost of the tax cuts.The maneuvers come in many forms, like phasing in certain cuts over a period of years and making some cuts \u201ctemporary\u201d with the full expectation that they will never actually be allowed to expire.\u201cIn some ways, this whole bill is a gimmick,\u201d Stan Collender, a former staff member for Democrats on the House and Senate Budget Committees, said of the Senate tax bill. \u201cRather than just do a tax cut that costs $1.5 trillion, they decided to do a $2 trillion-plus tax cut and lie about it costing $1.5 trillion.\u201dSome experts say the cuts, if accurately accounted for, could translate into slower economic growth and bigger budget deficits in the long run. If the cuts are not temporary, they will have to be paid for with additional debt, which will add to the federal deficit and increase the interest costs the United States must pay when it borrows money.The budget maneuvers are meant to help Republicans stay within the $1.5 trillion box they created that allows them to pass a tax bill without Democratic votes. Under budget reconciliation rules that allow for a party-line vote, Republicans can add no more than $1.5 trillion to the budget deficit over 10 years and cannot add to the deficit at all beyond that period.Such sleights of hand in accounting are more prevalent in the Senate plan, which makes many of its cuts temporary or delays their enforcement. For instance, the Senate bill delays the corporate tax cut, which will fall to 20 percent from 35 percent, by one year for savings of about $100 billion. It also saves about $240 billion by making the individual income tax cuts \u201ctemporary\u201d and setting them to expire in 2025.Other tax breaks are phased in slowly or phased out. Businesses are allowed to fully expense only their capital investments, including equipment purchases, through 2022. And, beginning in 2024, the ability to carry net operating losses forward would be limited as a percent of taxable income. In 2026, research and experimental expenditures would have to be written off gradually, or amortized, rather than immediately deducted, which reduces the revenue hit to the federal budget.Republican leaders in Congress and the Trump administration have acknowledged the budget maneuvers, saying they expect the temporary tax cuts to stay in place.A comparison of tax rates under the current law vs. the Senate tax bill\u2019s proposed changes.\u201cAs a result of the reconciliation process and scoring and the Byrd Rule, there are certain parts of this that expire,\u201d the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on CNBC on Friday. \u201cBut we have every expectation that down the road that Congress will extend them.\u201d The Byrd rule refers to restrictions put in place by former Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia that prevent legislation that adds to the deficit in the long-term.To deficit hawks, underselling the true cost of tax cuts is counterproductive and potentially dangerous for the economy.\u201cThe gimmicks not only damage the bill\u2019s fiscal credibility but damage the bill\u2019s objectives at the same time,\u201d said Michael A. Peterson, the president and chief executive of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an organization that advocates fiscal responsibility.That could work against Republicans when the time comes that they do not control the House, Senate and White House, and it means that the corporate tax cuts that have been made permanent could be up for negotiation in the future.\u201cIf Democrats are in control, they may extend those tax benefits for individuals and pay for it by raising the corporate rate,\u201d said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute\u2019s Tax Policy Center. \u201cThis is an area where business supporters of this bill might want to be a little bit careful about where it\u2019s going to go.\u201dSome Republican lawmakers are playing down the use of such maneuvers, arguing that they are merely following arcane Congressional rules that require them to make hard choices.Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho, lamented that the rules did not allow Republicans to consider the \u201cdynamic\u201d effects that he believed tax cuts would have on economic growth when assessing his party\u2019s tax plan.\u201cI don\u2019t believe dynamic scoring is a gimmick,\u201d Mr. Crapo said, referring to an approach to analyzing the effects of tax cuts, which accounts for the possibility that lower tax rates will promote growth and therefore raise revenue. \u201cThe reality is that if we could get agreement to use a fair dynamic score, which I think would be supported by most economists, these issues would go away.\u201dBut others are not yet convinced that the tax plan as it stands is sufficiently fiscally responsible.\u201cWe\u2019re looking globally at the whole thing and trying to do what we can to make it more fiscally palatable,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. \u201cFor 11 years around here, my big concern has been fiscal issues and I\u2019d love to see us do something that\u2019s very progrowth but I don\u2019t want to throw the fiscal side out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit Cost Rises as Britain Retreats on Divorce Demands", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat Mr. Johnson was saying was that Britain could secure the economic benefits of membership in the European Union without paying a penalty or being subject to its rules, particularly on the free movement of labor within the bloc.For months, supporters of the withdrawal, known as Brexit, have rejected the idea of paying a substantial exit bill to honor commitments. Some, like the Euroskeptic lawmaker John Redwood has insisted that Britain owed nothing at all.Yet, with time running out for Britain before it departs in March 2019, such pledges have collided, brutally, with reality.In the meantime, other reversals are quietly underway. Lawmakers were initially told that European Union law would cease to apply to Britain in March 2019, when it leaves. Now, the government has accepted that during the sort of \u201cstandstill\u201d transition that Britain badly wants, European rules \u2014 including new ones \u2014 will apply to Britain, as will judgments of the European Court of Justice.During this standstill transition \u2014 which Mrs. May suggests could be two years \u2014 Britain will also have to accept the free movement of European citizens and will not be able to control migration from the Continent \u2014 even though immigration was perhaps the argument that proved decisive in the referendum.Britain\u2019s new pragmatism stands in contrast to some early remarks by Prime Minister Theresa May, who insisted that no deal with the European Union was better than a bad one, implying that she was ready to walk away from the table.But the reality, analysts and business leaders have been saying with increasing emphasis, is that Mrs. May desperately needs to show progress on a reasonable departure plan, not a \u201ccliff edge\u201d exit that would potentially throw the economy into chaos. Business leaders have warned repeatedly that they will be forced to begin shifting operations out of Britain in the new year if nothing further is accomplished.Supporters of the government argue that some of the European Union\u2019s initial demands for an exit payment were higher than those now being discussed, and that after it withdraws, Britain will not make its regular contributions of around $11 billion a year.In reality, Britain already had a weak hand, which has been made worse by the fact that Mrs. May, who argued tepidly to remain in the European Union during the 2016 referendum, has had to placate her more ideologically pro-Brexit colleagues. They fretted about any delay to Britain\u2019s departure, so in March Mrs. May triggered the exit procedure, before Britain was fully prepared, by invoking Article 50 of the European Union\u2019s treaty, which put negotiations under a two-year deadline.It hardly helped that Mrs. May then called a general election during which she lost valuable negotiating time and sacrificed her parliamentary majority, and with it her authority \u2014 allowing her cabinet to go to war over Brexit strategy.In the meantime, economic signals have grown increasingly alarming. Despite referendum promises of a rosy future, Britain\u2019s economy has sunk from being the fastest-growing among developed nations to the slowest. Investment in critical sectors like the auto industry has contracted sharply.Inflation has spiked due a significant fall in the value of the pound sterling since the referendum, putting a squeeze on living standards. Consumer spending is down, with car sales falling for seven consecutive months. According to some estimates, living standards will not return to their 2008 values until 2022 at the earliest.The gloom was compounded when Britain recently lost the right to host two European Union agencies, for medicine and finance, which will relocate to the Continent.Mrs. May needs to get agreement on starting talks future trade arrangements at a meeting of European leaders in mid-December. That may be possible given her new offer on the divorce, providing that a way forward can be found on the other tricky issue, the border with Ireland.Even then, Britain is unlikely to achieve the ambitious trade deal with the bloc that it wants, analysts say.\u201cAlthough the current focus is on the separation, the next phase of the talks could prove much harder and more acrimonious,\u201d wrote Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute, in an analysis. \u201cE.U. negotiators think the British government is deluded about the kind of future relationship it can achieve.\u201dSomewhat surprisingly, the growing cost of Brexit (\u00a33 billion has been allocated for preparations, to add to the \u00a3700 million already spent) has proved less problematic among Mrs. May\u2019s Conservatives, or Tories, than some expected.The small band of pro-European Tories want to keep good relations with the European Union, and therefore think that the exit bill is justified.By contrast, Brexit enthusiasts know that, however happy they would be to crash out of the bloc without a deal, that prospect would spook business and could prompt a damaging downturn. That, in turn, might provoke a shift in public opinion against Brexit, which could endanger support for the departure before it is completed.So, ardent supporters of Brexit on Wednesday were putting their best gloss on the multibillion euro divorce settlement they neglected to mention to voters in 2016.One of those, the former Conservative Party leader and prominent pro-Brexit campaigner, Iain Duncan Smith, told the BBC that Britain is, \u201cgetting a bargain just by leaving the E.U.\u201d That, analysts were quick to note, was a far cry from previous promises.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Don\u2019t Sanders Supporters Care About the Russia Investigation?", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNearly every day, new details emerge about the relationship between Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russian government. The extent of the alleged collusion, which may ultimately endanger Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, has yet to be determined, but the scandal has dominated news coverage and enthralled Washington.And yet to many observers on America\u2019s political left, questions about Russia\u2019s interference in last year\u2019s election are a frustrating distraction.But as the investigation led by Robert Mueller closes in on more Trump associates like Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, it seems clear that the Russia story is only going to get bigger. Rather than downplay or deny it, the left should embrace it. Mr. Trump\u2019s Russia ties illustrate the dangers of inequality and elite corruption \u2014 and point to the need for radical solutions.While Mr. Manafort crossed lines (he has confessed to making false statements and material omissions) and now faces legal consequences, his long career typifies the amorality, opulence and lack of accountability that successive American governments have enabled.Many establishment Democrats and Republicans in the self-proclaimed \u201cresistance\u201d to Mr. Trump say they are deeply concerned about the Russia scandal, but they have largely failed to consider its full implications.To \u201cNever Trump\u201d conservatives, the main takeaways are that the United States needs to step up its confrontation with Russia in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere, and that the Obama administration was insufficiently tough on Mr. Putin. Many Democrats, meanwhile, argue that Russian interference means that Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency is illegitimate and that Mrs. Clinton is not to blame for her loss.As a rising generation of leftists increasingly asserts itself within the Democratic Party \u2014 and may, eventually, have the opportunity to shape foreign policy \u2014 it must articulate a new approach to Russia consistent with its core values. This approach should be driven neither by the interests of the national security state nor by the energy sector. Instead, it should aim to block Russia\u2019s kleptocratic elite from safeguarding its assets in the United States, to clean up the influence of foreign lobbying on Washington and to shut down tax havens for billionaires everywhere. The investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s Russia ties provides an opportunity to focus on these issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reza Zarrab, Turk at Center of Iran Sanctions Case, Is Helping Prosecution", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Turkish-Iranian gold trader whose prosecution in Manhattan drew sharp criticism from Turkey\u2019s president has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with the American authorities, a federal prosecutor disclosed in court on Tuesday.The trader, Reza Zarrab, who is being held by the authorities at an undisclosed location, pleaded guilty on Oct. 26 to all seven counts against him, including conspiracy to violate the United States sanctions against Iran, newly unsealed court records show.Mr. Zarrab is expected to testify on Wednesday as a government witness in the trial of a Turkish banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, that began this week in Federal District Court. Mr. Zarrab, Mr. Atilla, and seven other defendants were charged with participating in a billion-dollar scheme to smuggle gold for oil in violation of the Iran sanctions.On Tuesday, in his opening statement to the jury, the prosecutor said the men had used front companies and false documentation, told lies to American officials and paid bribes at the highest levels of the Turkish government.\u201cThese are serious federal crimes that compromise our national security,\u201d the prosecutor, David W. Denton Jr., said. He indicated that Mr. Zarrab would testify against Mr. Atilla and \u201ctell you the story firsthand, as he lived it.\u201d\u201cThe evidence is going to pull back the curtain on a fraud of truly global proportions,\u201d Mr. Denton said, \u201cbillions of Iranian dollars moving in a scheme so large that it affected the economies of countries in the Middle East, and so large that it was protected by government ministers in Turkey and Iran.\u201dMr. Zarrab\u2019s decision to cooperate could further strain relations between the United States and Turkey, especially if Mr. Zarrab reveals evidence of corruption in Turkish government and banking circles.The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has already raised the case with American officials, including in a telephone call with President Trump in September. He has depicted the prosecution as a continuation of a 2016 coup attempt against him, which he has laid to followers of the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is living in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania.\u201cWhen that plot failed, they set up the same plot in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Erdogan told Parliament this month.The seven other defendants charged by the United States, who all remain at large, prosecutors have said, include a former Turkish economy minister, Zafer Caglayan, and Suleyman Aslan, a former general manager of Halkbank, a state-owned bank that prosecutors have depicted as playing a major role in the scheme.Mr. Zarrab, 34, had \u201ca direct line\u201d to both men, Mr. Denton said.Halkbank, in a statement in Turkey, dismissed news media speculation that it might be subject to prosecution in the case and said all its business had been conducted in accordance with national and international regulations.In 2013, the Turkish police said they had uncovered the bribery scheme and arrested Mr. Zarrab, Mr. Aslan and others. But, Mr. Denton told the jury, bribes \u201cbought a cover-up.\u201dTurkish officials, he said, organized a purge of the police and prosecutors who had run the case, sent many of them to jail and shut down the investigation. Mr. Zarrab and others were released.Mr. Denton said that \u201cthe same corrupt high-ranking Turkish officials instructed Zarrab to put up even more bribe money for the judges, millions and millions in bribes, so that everything could be made to go away.\u201d\u201cZarrab paid the money,\u201d Mr. Denton said, \u201cco-conspirators got out of jail, and the case the Turkish police had developed was dismissed.\u201dBut it turned out that the Turkish police were not the only ones watching, Mr. Denton said. Since 2013, he said, the F.B.I.\u2019s counterintelligence division had been running its own investigation.\u201cThe F.B.I. pieced together what was going on,\u201d Mr. Denton said, \u201cand the evidence they found tells the same story that the evidence collected by the Turkish police did.\u201dOn Tuesday, the Turkish authorities were again taking measures, this time in response to the case in New York.Mr. Erdemir is a Turkey expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based group that has strongly criticized Iran. The group\u2019s chief executive, Mark Dubowitz, testified for the prosecution in the Zarrab case on Tuesday about the history of the Iran sanctions.Mr. Erdemir, in a statement, called the Turkish charges against him false, defamatory and \u201centirely political in nature\u201d and said, \u201cThe Turkish government has a regrettable history of harassing and intimidating critics and experts.\u201dIn court on Tuesday, the government asked the judge, Richard M. Berman, to unseal court papers related to Mr. Zarrab\u2019s guilty plea. They show that he also pleaded guilty to money laundering, bank fraud and a bribery conspiracy charge.The bribery charge, which prosecutors had not previously made public, relates to payments Mr. Zarrab made to a corrections officer at the federal jail in New York where he was being held to induce officers to smuggle contraband in for him, including cellphones and alcohol.Mr. Atilla\u2019s lawyer, Victor J. Rocco, told the jury that Mr. Zarrab had also paid bribes in the jail to gain access to women.A spokesman for the jail declined to comment on the specifics of the incidents but said, \u201cAll cases of inmate misconduct are investigated accordingly and appropriate action is taken.\u201dMr. Rocco, in the defense\u2019s opening statement, said his client was not corrupt, had taken no bribes and was a \u201chard-working person,\u201d like the jurors themselves. Mr. Atilla, 47, was the bank\u2019s deputy general manager for international banking.Mr. Rocco signaled that the defense\u2019s strategy would be to attack the credibility of Mr. Zarrab\u2019s testimony. Mr. Rocco said Mr. Zarrab had paid \u201cfortunes in bribes\u201d to businessmen and government leaders in Russia, China, Iran and Turkey \u201cto get what he wanted.\u201d\u201cTo Zarrab, bribery was a way of life,\u201d Mr. Rocco said. \u201cTo Zarrab, everyone has a price.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ireland Edges Toward Snap Election as Government Teeters", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBLIN \u2014 Ireland\u2019s political turmoil deepened on Friday, pushing the minority government in Dublin toward collapse just weeks before it is set to play a central role in negotiations over Britain\u2019s planned departure from the European Union.The government of Prime Minister Leo Varadkar is able to remain in power in Ireland only with the support of the main opposition party that, on Friday, submitted a motion of no-confidence in his deputy prime minister \u2014 part an enduring dispute over her role in a policing scandal.The summit meeting is supposed to determine whether Britain has satisfied the other European Union members that negotiations have made sufficient progress to initiate parallel bargaining on a trade deal between London and the 27 remaining countries in the bloc.In Dublin, the parties seemed deadlocked on Friday. Micheal Martin, the leader of the opposition Fianna Fail, said an election \u201ccan be avoided\u201d if Mr. Varadkar fired his deputy, Frances Fitzgerald.Opposition leaders have questioned Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s role in a previous government that they accuse of failing to shield a whistle-blower who exposed police corruption.Ms. Fitzgerald could defuse the crisis herself by resigning. But she has shown no sign she will do so, and Mr. Varadkar\u2019s Fine Gael party has defended her strongly so far. Michael D\u2019Arcy, a finance minister, said Ms. Fitzgerald \u201ccannot resign and should not resign.\u201dHe told the news agency Reuters that a withdrawal of the no-confidence motion was the only way to defuse the crisis. T he motion is set to be debated by the Parliament in Dublin on Tuesday, possibly precipitating a snap election.\u201cI think we\u2019re heading for an election before Christmas,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Arcy said.An election campaign could influence how Mr. Varadkar approaches the summit meeting in December and whether he is seen by other European leaders as a weakened figure with few prospects of political survival.Some analysts suggested that he might use the meeting to drum up political support at home among Ireland\u2019s anti-Brexit voters by adopting a tough line against Britain.The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said his country \u201cdoes not need\u201d an election at this stage when there are \u201csome really, really serious issues for the government to manage in the national interest.\u201dHe also said on Thursday that the government wanted the British authorities to clarify their intentions on maintaining an open border with Northern Ireland. He said that was a prerequisite for Dublin to allow the broader Brexit discussions to move to trade talks.Apart from the Irish border arrangement, the European Union wants Britain to reach agreement on two other big issues: a financial settlement to leave the European Union, and legal protection for European Union citizens in Britain.Ed O\u2019Loughlin reported from Dublin, and Alan Cowell from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Clear Major Hurdle as Tax Bill Advances", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPassage of the tax overhaul, which seemed uncertain on Monday, strengthened considerably on Tuesday after the Senate Budget Committee voted along party lines to advance the plan. A flurry of last-minute deal making helped garner the support of a few Republican lawmakers who had expressed concerns about the $1.5 trillion package, including its treatment of small businesses and its effect on the deficit.\u201cI think we\u2019re going to get it passed,\u201d he said later at the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have lots of adjustments before it ends, but the end result will be a very, very massive \u2014 the largest in the history of our country \u2014 tax cut.\u201dRepublicans emerged from the lunch increasingly optimistic about the bill\u2019s fate and playing down the concerns that had threatened to bedevil its passage. Three key Republican holdouts, Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, sounded positive about the bill on Tuesday after gaining assurances from Mr. Trump and the Republican leadership that their worries would be addressed.The Senate bill would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from a top rate of 35 percent. For individuals, it would make tax cuts temporary and create seven income tax brackets, with a bottom rate of 10 percent and a top marginal rate of 38.5 percent, down from the current rate of 39.6 percent.Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said that he felt encouraged that the two chambers would be able to align their bills but that the House would not simply pass the Senate legislation.\u201cFor as much common ground as we have, there are some areas where we are taking different approaches that will be worked, and can only be worked out, in a conference,\u201d Mr. Brady said.Lawmakers are also awaiting a report from the Joint Committee on Taxation that would show the effects of the proposed tax cuts on the economy. That analysis is important, since it will indicate the extent to which the cuts will bolster growth and avoid adding to the deficit. Outside analysts expect the assessment to demonstrate that the Senate bill does not create nearly enough growth to generate revenues to offset those lost via tax cuts, essentially undermining Republicans\u2019 claims that the bill would pay for itself.Mr. Corker, who has voiced the loudest concerns about the bill\u2019s effect on the deficit, said on Tuesday that he received assurances that the final legislation would include a mechanism to avoid ballooning the debt, which has passed $20 trillion. While the exact details were not specified, the bill is expected to include some type of trigger that would require certain taxes to increase if the package does not generate as much revenue as projected.\u201cI think we\u2019ve come to a pretty acceptable place, from my standpoint,\u201d said Mr. Corker, who has stated that he would be unable to vote for the bill if it added to the federal deficit.That trigger, however, could complicate the bill\u2019s passage. Several other Republican lawmakers, including Mr. Brady and Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, are resistant to the idea of including a trigger that would increase taxes.\u201cI\u2019m not too keen on automatic tax increases,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cI\u2019m just not too excited about this idea of automatically tying our hands.\u201dAmericans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by Charles G. and David H. Koch, also blasted the idea, calling a trigger mechanism \u201cantithetical to the principles of the unified tax framework\u201d that lawmakers have proposed.Senate Republicans\u2019 tax cut would not pay for itself, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.During lunch with Mr. Trump, the president chastised Mr. Johnson over objections he raised in the meeting, telling the senator at one point, \u201cCome on, Ron,\u201d according to a person familiar with the discussion who declined to be identified because the event was not public.Mr. Johnson voted for the bill on Tuesday, telling reporters: \u201cThe good news is, everybody agrees it\u2019s a problem, it has to be fixed. I just keep getting assurances it\u2019s going to be fixed. I just want to see how.\u201dOther Republican senators who have been skeptical of the tax bill also appeared ready to back it.Ms. Collins, who has not yet thrown her support behind the bill, said that she felt more optimistic about the plan after meeting with the president.\u201cI believe that a lot of my concerns, it appears, are going to be addressed and that I\u2019m going to be getting the opportunity to offer amendments on the Senate floor,\u201d she said.Ms. Collins said that the president was supportive of her wishes that $10,000 of property taxes be deductible under the Senate plan, a change that would be similar to the compromise that House Republicans made on the repeal of the state and local tax deduction. She also said that Mr. Trump was supportive of backing legislation to help stabilize health insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act, which she said would help mitigate the effects of ending the law\u2019s requirement that most people have insurance, as the tax bill would do.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said that Senate Republicans were increasingly united about repealing the requirement that most people have health insurance or pay a penalty.He said that Mr. Trump was very involved in the details of the tax package on Tuesday and that he took several questions from senators.\u201cHe had a vigorous back-and-forth,\u201d Mr. Alexander said.Both Mr. Alexander and Ms. Collins demurred when asked whether they would be concerned if the Joint Committee on Taxation report showed that the bill would increase the deficit even with additional economic growth.\u201cI\u2019m not going to be hypothetical about that,\u201d Mr. Alexander said.Democrats on the Budget Committee assailed their Republican colleagues for shedding their deficit hawk feathers and backing a bill that they say is fiscally irresponsible. Many Republican senators left after protesters disrupted the meeting, chanting, \u201cKill the bill.\u201dAcknowledging that a final vote was most likely days away, Democratic leaders appeared to have few procedural maneuvers left to slow the progress of the tax bill.\u201cOur Republican colleagues, in their rush to get a bill done, are legislating in an irresponsible way, especially when it comes to something as important and complex as the tax code,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader.Nicholas Fandos and Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Arab Spring, at Last", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "OpinionThe crown prince has big plans for his society.Supported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 I never thought I\u2019d live long enough to write this sentence: The most significant reform process underway anywhere in the Middle East today is in Saudi Arabia. Yes, you read that right. Though I came here at the start of Saudi winter, I found the country going through its own Arab Spring, Saudi style.Unlike the other Arab Springs \u2014 all of which emerged bottom up and failed miserably, except in Tunisia \u2014 this one is led from the top down by the country\u2019s 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and, if it succeeds, it will not only change the character of Saudi Arabia but the tone and tenor of Islam across the globe. Only a fool would predict its success \u2014 but only a fool would not root for it.To better understand it I flew to Riyadh to interview the crown prince, known as \u201cM.B.S.,\u201d who had not spoken about the extraordinary events here of early November, when his government arrested scores of Saudi princes and businessmen on charges of corruption and threw them into a makeshift gilded jail \u2014 the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton \u2014 until they agreed to surrender their ill-gotten gains. You don\u2019t see that every day.We met at night at his family\u2019s ornate adobe-walled palace in Ouja, north of Riyadh. M.B.S. spoke in English, while his brother, Prince Khalid, the new Saudi ambassador to the U.S., and several senior ministers shared different lamb dishes and spiced the conversation. After nearly four hours together, I surrendered at 1:15 a.m. to M.B.S.\u2019s youth, pointing out that I was exactly twice his age. It\u2019s been a long, long time, though, since any Arab leader wore me out with a fire hose of new ideas about transforming his country.We started with the obvious question: What\u2019s happening at the Ritz? And was this his power play to eliminate his family and private sector rivals before his ailing father, King Salman, turns the keys of the kingdom over to him?It\u2019s \u201cludicrous,\u201d he said, to suggest that this anticorruption campaign was a power grab. He pointed out that many prominent members of the Ritz crowd had already publicly pledged allegiance to him and his reforms, and that \u201ca majority of the royal family\u201d is already behind him. This is what happened, he said: \u201cOur country has suffered a lot from corruption from the 1980s until today. The calculation of our experts is that roughly 10 percent of all government spending was siphoned off by corruption each year, from the top levels to the bottom. Over the years the government launched more than one \u2018war on corruption\u2019 and they all failed. Why? Because they all started from the bottom up.\u201dSo when his father, who has never been tainted by corruption charges during his nearly five decades as governor of Riyadh, ascended to the throne in 2015 (at a time of falling oil prices), he vowed to put a stop to it all, M.B.S. said:\u201cMy father saw that there is no way we can stay in the G-20 and grow with this level of corruption. In early 2015, one of his first orders to his team was to collect all the information about corruption \u2014 at the top. This team worked for two years until they collected the most accurate information, and then they came up with about 200 names.\u201dWhen all the data was ready, the public prosecutor, Saud al-Mojib, took action, M.B.S. said, explaining that each suspected billionaire or prince was arrested and given two choices: \u201cWe show them all the files that we have and as soon as they see those about 95 percent agree to a settlement,\u201d which means signing over cash or shares of their business to the Saudi state treasury.\u201cAbout 1 percent,\u201d he added, \u201care able to prove they are clean and their case is dropped right there. About 4 percent say they are not corrupt and with their lawyers want to go to court. Under Saudi law, the public prosecutor is independent. We cannot interfere with his job \u2014 the king can dismiss him, but he is driving the process \u2026 We have experts making sure no businesses are bankrupted in the process\u201d \u2014 to avoid causing unemployment.\u201cHow much money are they recovering?\u201d I asked.The public prosecutor says it could eventually \u201cbe around $100 billion in settlements,\u201d said M.B.S.There is no way, he added, to root out all corruption from top to the bottom, \u201cSo you have to send a signal, and the signal going forward now is, \u2018You will not escape.\u2019 And we are already seeing the impact,\u201d like people writing on social media, \u201cI called my middle man and he doesn\u2019t answer.\u201d Saudi business people who paid bribes to get services done by bureaucrats are not being prosecuted, explained M.B.S. \u201cIt\u2019s those who shook the money out of the government\u201d \u2014 by overcharging and getting kickbacks.The stakes are high for M.B.S. in this anticorruption drive. If the public feels that he is truly purging corruption that was sapping the system and doing so in a way that is transparent and makes clear to future Saudi and foreign investors that the rule of law will prevail, it will really instill a lot of new confidence in the system. But if the process ends up feeling arbitrary, bullying and opaque, aimed more at aggregating power for power\u2019s sake and unchecked by any rule of law, it will end up instilling fear that will unnerve Saudi and foreign investors in ways the country can\u2019t afford.But one thing I know for sure: Not a single Saudi I spoke to here over three days expressed anything other than effusive support for this anticorruption drive. The Saudi silent majority is clearly fed up with the injustice of so many princes and billionaires ripping off their country. While foreigners, like me, were inquiring about the legal framework for this operation, the mood among Saudis I spoke with was: \u201cJust turn them all upside down, shake the money out of their pockets and don\u2019t stop shaking them until it\u2019s all out!\u201dBut guess what? This anticorruption drive is only the second-most unusual and important initiative launched by M.B.S. The first is to bring Saudi Islam back to its more open and modern orientation \u2014 whence it diverted in 1979. That is, back to what M.B.S. described to a recent global investment conference here as a \u201cmoderate, balanced Islam that is open to the world and to all religions and all traditions and peoples.\u201dI know that year well. I started my career as a reporter in the Middle East in Beirut in 1979, and so much of the region that I have covered since was shaped by the three big events of that year: the takeover of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Saudi puritanical extremists \u2014 who denounced the Saudi ruling family as corrupt, impious sellouts to Western values; the Iranian Islamic revolution; and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.These three events together freaked out the Saudi ruling family at the time, and prompted it to try to shore up its legitimacy by allowing its Wahhabi clerics to impose a much more austere Islam on the society and by launching a worldwide competition with Iran\u2019s ayatollahs over who could export more fundamentalist Islam. It didn\u2019t help that the U.S. tried to leverage this trend by using Islamist fighters against Russia in Afghanistan. In all, it pushed Islam globally way to the right and helped nurture 9/11.A lawyer by training, who rose up in his family\u2019s education-social welfare foundation, M.B.S. is on a mission to bring Saudi Islam back to the center. He has not only curbed the authority of the once feared Saudi religious police to berate a woman for not covering every inch of her skin, he has also let women drive. And unlike any Saudi leader before him, he has taken the hard-liners on ideologically. As one U.S.-educated 28-year-old Saudi woman told me: M.B.S. \u201cuses a different language. He says, \u2018We are going to destroy extremism.\u2019 He\u2019s not sugar-coating. That is reassuring to me that the change is real.\u201dIndeed, M.B.S. instructed me: \u201cDo not write that we are \u2018reinterpreting\u2019 Islam \u2014 we are \u2018restoring\u2019 Islam to its origins \u2014 and our biggest tools are the Prophet\u2019s practices and [daily life in] Saudi Arabia before 1979.\u201d At the time of the Prophet Muhammad, he argued, there were musical theaters, there was mixing between men and women, there was respect for Christians and Jews in Arabia. \u201cThe first commercial judge in Medina was a woman!\u201d So if the Prophet embraced all of this, M.B.S. asked, \u201cDo you mean the Prophet was not a Muslim?\u201dThen one of his ministers got out his cellphone and shared with me pictures and YouTube videos of Saudi Arabia in the 1950s \u2014 women without heads covered, wearing skirts and walking with men in public, as well as concerts and cinemas. It was still a traditional and modest place, but not one where fun had been outlawed, which is what happened after 1979.If this virus of an antipluralistic, misogynistic Islam that came out of Saudi Arabia in 1979 can be reversed by Saudi Arabia, it would drive moderation across the Muslim world and surely be welcomed here where 65 percent of the population is under 30.One middle-age Saudi banker said to me: \u201cMy generation was held hostage by 1979. I know now that my kids will not be hostages.\u201d Added a 28-year-old Saudi woman social entrepreneur: \u201cTen years ago when we talked about music in Riyadh it meant buying a CD \u2014 now it is about the concert next month and what ticket are you buying and which of your friends will go with you.\u201dSaudi Arabia would have a very long way to go before it approached anything like Western standards for free speech and women\u2019s rights. But as someone who has been coming here for almost 30 years, it blew my mind to learn that you can hear Western classical music concerts in Riyadh now, that country singer Toby Keith held a men-only concert here in September, where he even sang with a Saudi, and that Lebanese soprano Hiba Tawaji will be among the first woman singers to perform a women-only concert here on Dec. 6. And M.B.S told me, it was just decided that women will be able to go to stadiums and attend soccer games. The Saudi clerics have completely acquiesced.The Saudi education minister chimed in that among a broad set of education reforms, he\u2019s redoing and digitizing all textbooks, sending 1,700 Saudi teachers each year to world-class schools in places like Finland to upgrade their skills, announcing that for the first time Saudi girls will have physical education classes in public schools and this year adding an hour to the Saudi school day for kids to explore their passions in science and social issues, under a teacher\u2019s supervision, with their own projects.So many of these reforms were so long overdue it\u2019s ridiculous. Better late than never, though.On foreign policy, M.B.S. would not discuss the strange goings on with Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon coming to Saudi Arabia and announcing his resignation, seemingly under Saudi pressure, and now returning to Beirut and rescinding that resignation. He simply insisted that the bottom line of the whole affair is that Hariri, a Sunni Muslim, is not going to continue providing political cover for a Lebanese government that is essentially controlled by the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah militia, which is essentially controlled by Tehran.He insisted that the Saudi-backed war in Yemen, which has been a humanitarian nightmare, was tilting in the direction of the pro-Saudi legitimate government there, which, he said is now in control of 85 percent of the country, but given the fact that pro-Iranian Houthi rebels, who hold the rest, launched a missile at Riyadh airport, anything less than 100 percent is still problematic.His general view seemed to be that with the backing of the Trump administration \u2014 he praised President Trump as \u201cthe right person at the right time\u201d \u2014 the Saudis and their Arab allies were slowly building a coalition to stand up to Iran. I am skeptical. The dysfunction and rivalries within the Sunni Arab world generally have prevented forming a unified front up to now, which is why Iran indirectly controls four Arab capitals today \u2014 Damascus, Sana, Baghdad and Beirut. That Iranian over-reach is one reason M.B.S. was scathing about Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Iran\u2019s \u201csupreme leader is the new Hitler of the Middle East,\u201d said M.B.S. \u201cBut we learned from Europe that appeasement doesn\u2019t work. We don\u2019t want the new Hitler in Iran to repeat what happened in Europe in the Middle East.\u201d What matters most, though, is what Saudi Arabia does at home to build its strength and economy.But can M.B.S. and his team see this through? Again, I make no predictions. He has his flaws that he will have to control, insiders here tell me. They include relying on a very tight circle of advisers who don\u2019t always challenge him sufficiently, and a tendency to start too many things that don\u2019t get finished. There\u2019s a whole list. But guess what? Perfect is not on the menu here. Someone had to do this job \u2014 wrench Saudi Arabia into the 21st century \u2014 and M.B.S. stepped up. I, for one, am rooting for him to succeed in his reform efforts.And so are a lot of young Saudis. There was something a 30-year-old Saudi woman social entrepreneur said to me that stuck in my ear. \u201cWe are privileged to be the generation that has seen the before and the after.\u201d The previous generation of Saudi women, she explained, could never imagine a day when a woman could drive and the coming generation will never be able to imagine a day when a woman couldn\u2019t.\u201cBut I will always remember not being able to drive,\u201d she told me. And the fact that starting in June that will never again be so \u201cgives me so much hope. It proves to me that anything is possible \u2014 that this is a time of opportunity. We have seen things change and we are young enough to make the transition.\u201dThis reform push is giving the youth here a new pride in their country, almost a new identity, which many of them clearly relish. Being a Saudi student in post-9/11 America, young Saudis confess, is to always feel you are being looked at as a potential terrorist or someone who comes from a country locked in the Stone Age.Now they have a young leader who is driving religious and economic reform, who talks the language of high tech, and whose biggest sin may be that he wants to go too fast. Most ministers are now in their 40s \u2014 and not 60s. And with the suffocating hand of a puritanical Islam being lifted, it\u2019s giving them a chance to think afresh about their country and their identity as Saudis.\u201cWe need to restore our culture to what it was before the [Islamic] radical culture took over,\u201d a Saudi woman friend who works with an N.G.O. said to me. \u201d`We have 13 regions in this country, and they each have a different cuisine. But nobody knows that. Did you know that? But I never saw one Saudi dish go global. It is time for us to embrace who we are and who we were.\u201dAlas, who Saudi Arabia is also includes a large cohort of older, more rural, more traditional Saudis, and pulling them into the 21st century will be a challenge. But that\u2019s in part why every senior bureaucrat is working crazy hours now. They know M.B.S. can call them on the phone at any of those hours to find out if something he wanted done is getting done. I told him his work habits reminded me of a line in the play \u201cHamilton,\u201d when the chorus asks: Why does he always work like \u201che\u2019s running out of time.\u201d\u201cBecause,\u201d said M.B.S., ``I fear that the day I die I am going to die without accomplishing what I have in my mind. Life is too short and a lot of things can happen, and I am really keen to see it with my own eyes \u2014 and that is why I am in a hurry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Latest in Graphic Novels", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoundupThe core of the book is a 44-part analysis of each individual element of that strip and the artistic considerations behind it, from the way Sluggo\u2019s cap interrupts the contour of his final word balloon to the precise number of droplets emerging from a water spigot (four): \u201cWhen these drips are taken together with the previous panel\u2019s spritzes, a mental image is constructed of Sluggo demolished in a fulsome blast of liquid comeuppance.\u201d Karasik and Newgarden augment their argument with extensive historical context for that August morning\u2019s \u201cNancy\u201d strip. The book features an illustrated biography of Bushmiller, explaining how he took over Larry Whittington\u2019s feature \u201cFritzi Ritz\u201d in 1925, and how Fritzi\u2019s frizzy-haired niece Nancy, introduced in 1933, got the strip renamed after her five years later. One of many appendixes is an extended history of the \u201cwater hose\u201d gag from its origins in belle epoque Parisian cartoons through its appearance in an early Louis Lumi\u00e8re film; another one catalogs other \u201cNancy\u201d strips with similar elements. And the late Jerry Lewis, of all people, supplies a four-sentence foreword \u2014 as in Bushmiller\u2019s art, the gesture alone makes it funny.\u201cSpinning\u201d gradually reveals itself as a coming-out story, too. \u201cA teacher\u2019s aide had shown me how to hold your sleeve when you put your jacket on,\u201d Walden writes. \u201cI still remember her hands on my shoulders. I didn\u2019t have a word to describe it yet, but in that moment I knew.\u201d When she meets her first girlfriend, we see them nervously watching a video on \u201chow to kiss a girl\u201d together. Walden evokes emotional states with elegantly composed panels: minimal, tentative lines, more delicate than a blade\u2019s, surrounded by bold swatches of negative space. (The entire book is printed in a chilly dark purple ink, except for a few passages in which a solid, pale yellow stands in for sunlight or electric light.) After a sexual assault, she finds herself drifting through life for a while, and the narrative shifts to disconnected, full-page images. Later, a crucial competition appears as a fusillade of little panels, with tiny drawings of Walden in motion alternating with transcriptions of her fragmented thoughts.All of that fun, though, is in the service of the sucker punch tonal shifts that arrive whenever \u201c4 Kids\u201d seems to be going in a predictable direction. This is a tragedy trying to avoid recognition by wearing a disposable comedy mask. Paige thinks she\u2019s in an I-love-it-when-a-plan-comes-together heist story, but she\u2019s actually in an everything-goes-horribly-wrong heist story. And her friends, having grown up on tales where plucky kids can play detective (or criminal) and save the day, aren\u2019t prepared for what happens when blood starts flowing.At first, the kids are desperate to figure out what, exactly, their role in this sugar-buzz \u201cMy Little Pony\u201d scenario is supposed to be, and to get back to the real world. As the months pass, though, they acclimate to the peaches\u2019 way of life, and find themselves beginning to forget their old reality, until an abrupt ending suggests that a future volume will bring them home, or at least give them a new perspective. (The story gently implies that this isn\u2019t the sort of paradise you can come back from.) Whyte draws the early \u201creal-world\u201d section as pencil sketches with a pale sepia tint behind them, and adopts different full-spectrum techniques for the sequences focusing on each of the human youths in the Forest of the Peaches: the flat-colored line drawings of animation cels, the crinkly 8-bit pixelations of old \u201cLegend of Zelda\u201d games, and finally blended paint-on-canvas tones.Karnau is fascinated with recording and studying human voices, and with collecting curious examples on reel-to-reel tapes and shellac discs: \u201cThis here, open vowels impinging on gutturals, is a youngster in his death throes losing all vocal control.\u201d His is a pseudoscientific curiosity untempered by any moral concerns; that makes him useful to Goebbels, whose inner circle he joins. (As we eventually learn, despite his constant bloviations about the meaning of voice, Karnau doesn\u2019t even understand the full range of sound all that well.) His young friend Helga, on the other hand, is too sheltered to grasp what\u2019s going on around her \u2014 although she\u2019s beginning to get a sense of it in the second half of the book, which largely takes place in the last 10 days of her life, in Hitler\u2019s bunker in the spring of 1945. Lust counterposes the children\u2019s genteel hiking trips and war games with the atrocities Karnau dispassionately documents, drawing both narrators\u2019 segments to emphasize visual details over their context. Bodies are seen so close up that they become abstract masses of lines, like Lust\u2019s renderings of acoustic phenomena; faces are flattened into grotesque caricatures; scenes are half-obscured by tints that change from section to section \u2014 rusty purple, rusty orange, rusty green.The elder Rizzo was, naturally, saved by his newly developed passion for literature, going on to become an enthusiastic if unpublished writer. The lengthy prison drama he narrates to Charlie builds to a climax with suspiciously tidy symbolism, involving a burning library and a ceiling that opens to reveal the sky. The chief pleasure of this book, though, is Blair\u2019s artwork, which slathers on patterns, scribbles and frantically detailed cross-hatching of various densities, with only a few flashes of light to breathe air into most pages. (A few entr\u2019actes superimpose silhouettes and blocks of Matt Rizzo\u2019s writing upon a background of Braille dots.) He crams every scene with visual metaphors and allusions: In a sequence where Leopold and Rizzo are discussing the story of Dante\u2019s damned lovers Paolo and Francesca, the killer\u2019s explanations are superimposed on images of fratricides and lovers in the style of Greek pottery, and overseen by the hulking, empty-eyed figures that represent the specters of Leopold and Loeb as Rizzo imagined them in his youth.Unferth is best known as a prose fiction writer, and her language is sly and bitterly funny, matched in mood by Haidle\u2019s monochromatic, inkwash-style artwork, which plays up the story\u2019s whimsy as well as its sadness. Its characters and settings are presented as something like layered cut-paper silhouettes, and the birds who populate the book are sometimes detailed, sometimes the simplest of abstractions. The stripes of a cage\u2019s bars perpetually appear in one guise or another. Everything about the birds\u2019 presence suggests freedom, and everything about taking care of them traps Daphne a little more.Douglas Wolk is the author of \u201cReading Comics: How Graphic Novels Work and What They Mean.\u201d He writes frequently about comics for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade Worries Led Wisconsin Mill Town to Trump. It\u2019s Still Uneasy.", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "NEENAH, Wis. \u2014 In Winnebago County, they\u2019ve seen the paper mills close, one by one.For many, the villain is trade.Take Neenah Foundry, a 145-year-old operation that employs nearly 1,000 workers here. Its employees have watched in frustration as cheap manhole covers and sewer grates flood into the country from India and elsewhere, where competitors are eligible for government subsidies and face fewer environmental regulations.\u201cFor a long time, trade hasn\u2019t been fair,\u201d said Jeff Lamia, who started work at the foundry earning $5.35 an hour, fresh out of high school nearly 40 years ago, and now makes $27 an hour.\u201cThey can build stuff for pennies in China with no environmental rules,\u201d he added. \u201cOur foundry has an ungodly amount of emissions controls and that costs big money. Overseas, they throw it out into the air and we have to compete. That\u2019s not a level playing field.\u201dFew places embody the underlying economic and political dynamics of that switch more than Winnebago County. Almost a third of Wisconsin\u2019s 72 counties flipped from blue to red, and like most of them, Winnebago is heavily dependent on manufacturing, whether in gritty blue-collar towns like Oshkosh and Menasha or in Neenah, which is home to both factories and corporate offices downtown.Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on free trade and promises to bring back good-paying jobs from overseas resonated deeply here \u2014 even with lifelong Democrats like Mr. Lamia. Those issues, along with a growing disdain for politicians in general and Hillary Clinton in particular, prompted Mr. Lamia to choose Mr. Trump after voting for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.Other foundry workers like Jeff Olejnik, a Democrat who couldn\u2019t bring himself to vote for Mr. Trump in November and reluctantly supported Mrs. Clinton, admits that his message on trade was compelling.WinnebagoCounty, Wis.WINNEBAGOU.S.Population169,900323 mil.Percentage white89%61%Median householdincome in 2015$52,000$52,9002.8%4.1%Unemployment rateManufacturing shareof employment20%7%ELECTION RESULTS2012201647%RomneyTrump50%Obama51%Clinton43%By The New York Times\u00a0|\u00a0 Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Bureau of Economic Analysis\u201cWe need to take care of our people here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are at least a dozen paper mills in this area that have closed. You are losing good-paying jobs.\u201d\u201cPeople in the Midwest don\u2019t ask for much,\u201d he added. \u201cThey want to take a vacation once a year, have decent health care and enough money to pay their bills and save for retirement. That\u2019s our life, but pretty soon there won\u2019t be no middle class.\u201dFor many who have made a life in Neenah, it has been a place where a worker without a college degree can secure the middle-class security and comfort that have slipped out of reach elsewhere.Mr. Lamia and his wife own a home 10 minutes from the foundry, have three cars between them, and a decade ago they purchased a summer place in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula.In many respects, economic data for the area still paints a sanguine picture. At 2.8 percent, the county\u2019s unemployment rate is more than a full percentage point below the national average. Help-wanted signs hang from local factories, and Neenah Foundry recently raised hourly wages for chippers and grinders, an entry-level job, to about $12.25 an hour from $11.25.But there is a creeping sense of having to work harder just to stay in place, as salaries and lifestyles erode amid pressure from globalization and the unceasing demand for ever-rising profits in corporate America.\u201cPeople are working similar jobs to what their parents did but are not able to maintain the same lifestyle,\u201d said Mark Harris, a former mayor of Oshkosh who is now the Winnebago County executive. \u201cThat\u2019s causing anxiety.\u201dAnd while unemployment may be low now, older residents have seen factories and mills close in town after town, with Wisconsin losing 120,000 factory jobs over all since 2000, including 20,000 in the paper industry alone. Not only has that kept wages in check, but it has also prompted doubts among blue-collar workers about whether they \u2014 or their children \u2014 have much of an economic future here.\u201cWe had eight kids in our family, and my mother didn\u2019t have to work,\u201d Mr. Olejnik said. \u201cGrocery stores weren\u2019t open on Sunday and you spent time with your family. Now, the mall is open on Christmas Eve. We\u2019ve lost a lot.\u201dFamilies are always rising and falling in America, Nathaniel Hawthorne observed around the time John Bergstrom\u2019s ancestors arrived in Neenah from Norway 150 years ago, and Mr. Bergstrom can vouch for that.The first Bergstroms made cast-iron stoves and carriages. When new technologies made those businesses obsolete, they turned to what would become the region\u2019s dominant industry by the mid-20th century: paper.They prospered, and the Bergstroms joined the other paper barons who built mansions along Lake Winnebago. That house is now a museum, and the Bergstroms\u2019 paper business faded as mills closed.John Bergstrom, now 71, had the foresight to diversify, moving into automobile sales and then real estate. From a single General Motors dealership that opened in 1982, the Bergstrom family now dominates auto sales throughout the region, selling everything from Chevys and Cadillacs to Hondas, Toyotas and BMWs.\u201cChange is hard for people,\u201d Mr. Bergstrom said. \u201cSo many of the communities in the middle part of America were based on a particular business or industry, and when that changed, the community didn\u2019t. They lost the ability to continue to be what they once were.\u201dIndeed, as a developer, he helped Neenah avoid the fate of other Midwestern towns that depended on a single smokestack industry.In 1993, Mr. Bergstrom and 11 other local businessmen each put in $100,000 to develop a decrepit site downtown with a new office building. It quickly filled up \u2014 and since then Mr. Bergstrom has helped build seven new office buildings, lifting the work force in downtown Neenah from 500 to more than 3,700.One of those sites was the former Bergstrom paper mill, which the town tore down about a decade ago. It is now home to the headquarters of Plexus, a rapidly growing maker of complex electronic equipment that also has two manufacturing facilities nearby, employing nearly 2,000 people in all.\u201cWhen you fly on a 747, there are likely Plexus parts in that plane that were made here,\u201d said Dean Kaufert, the mayor of Neenah.There is still a paper mill downtown as well \u2014 Neenah Paper, which traces its roots to the 1870s and was spun off from Kimberly-Clark in 2004. The company has thrived by making high-end stationery, labels and other products requiring production and service know-how not easily replicated overseas.But the closing of so many other mills has a way of obscuring success stories.Passing the ruins of the abandoned plant in downtown Kimberly as he drove to work at Appleton Coated every day, Chris Bogan would have the same thought: His mill could be next.So when that came to pass this fall, after five years of winding massive paper rolls, Mr. Bogan was scared, but not shocked. \u201cThree days after I was hired at Appleton Coated, we were warned about layoffs, so I worried about it all the time,\u201d he said.Two other local manufacturers did step up and make offers to Mr. Bogan and other laid-off workers, but the $14 to $17 an hour they offered didn\u2019t come close to the $28.66 he was earning at the paper plant.And with his wife at home taking care of two toddlers, including a 2-year-old son with cerebral palsy, there was no way to bridge that gap. \u201cIf my wife was working, that would be acceptable, but in my situation that won\u2019t work,\u201d he said.A Marine veteran, Mr. Bogan has enrolled at Fox Valley Technical College, and hopes to receive his commercial trucking certification in a few months.That could lift his salary back above $20 an hour, but in the meantime he and his family are without health insurance. His son\u2019s therapy is covered by Medicaid.\u201cIt\u2019s been a little over a month, and people are coming to terms with the fact that we won\u2019t be making the same wages that we were,\u201d he said. Mr. Bogan said his main concern now was making sure his wife would still be able to bring their son to his occupational, speech and physical-therapy sessions each week.Downtown Neenah is only a 15-minute drive from his home, but the craft beers on tap there and the farm-to-table restaurants that have opened up might as well be in Madison or Brooklyn.\u201cThe area is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up on the outskirts of town, and as a local guy, it\u2019s not for me. I\u2019d rather cook a steak at home than go out and pay $120 for a meal.\u201dWatching those changes heightens the anxiety at an old-school manufacturer like Neenah Foundry, but these companies and their workers are adapting. Mr. Lamia, the 57-year-old veteran employee who backed Mr. Trump after decades of always voting a straight Democratic ticket, is a case in point.Although he complains that \u201cit\u2019s so hard to compete against Mexico,\u201d he has reinvented himself more than once during his career at Neenah Foundry.After his first job as a laborer was eliminated, he got a commercial driving license and drove trucks there. Looking to rise and avoid another layoff from the foundry, Mr. Lamia then spent one day a week for five years at Fox Valley Technical College and eventually became certified as an electrician. With overtime, he earns roughly $70,000 a year, a solidly middle-class wage here.Indeed, for workers with two-year degrees in fields like automation, metal fabrication and advanced manufacturing, employers are offering $50,000 to $60,000 to start. \u201cWe call them gold-collar workers in the state,\u201d said Susan May, the president of Fox Valley Technical College.But even as salaries for skilled workers like Mr. Lamia have risen, the number of low-paid entry-level laborers at Neenah Foundry is shrinking.His boss, Tom Riordan, is about to invest $15 million in robots, automating part of the process in which cast metal parts are removed from sand molds by unskilled chippers and grinders.\u201cAmerican manufacturers need to take a tough-love approach,\u201d he said, sitting in Neenah Foundry\u2019s nondescript board room, not far from the noisy factory floor. \u201cSometimes you just have to suck it up, adapt, and serve your customers.\u201dMr. Lamia favors another sort of tough love: tariffs aimed at the countries he feels are \u201cfeeding off the U.S. and don\u2019t play by the same rules.\u201dTo comply with new government regulations, for example, Neenah Foundry will spend more than $1 million over the next six months to reduce silica particles by half, to 25 parts per billion. In China and India, workers simply make do with masks, and Mr. Lamia doesn\u2019t believe he and his colleagues should be at a disadvantage when environmental standards overseas lag behind those in the United States.\u201cIf Neenah Foundry has to pay millions for emissions controls and China doesn\u2019t have to, then they should have to pay more to export to the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a level playing field, and this should have been done a long time ago.\u201dMexico is a more complicated case, Mr. Lamia added, especially given the country\u2019s role as a major importer of American grain and other products. \u201cTrump\u2019s got a lot on his plate, but he should impose tariffs on China for sure,\u201d he said.Appealing as the tough talk on trade might be at times, it wasn\u2019t enough to persuade Mr. Riordan, a self-described moderate Republican, to vote for Mr. Trump. Instead, he cast a write-in ballot for a fellow Wisconsinite, Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker.Mr. Riordan doesn\u2019t discount the appeal of Mexico to manufacturing executives like himself. But he\u2019s not considering a wholesale move south of the border for Neenah Foundry \u2014 instead, he wants to find ways to supply American manufacturers who have relocated there. \u201cA lot of our customers are heading south, and you go where the fish are at,\u201d he said.As for the Nafta trade deal now being renegotiated, Mr. Riordan favors keeping changes to a minimum, rather than ripping up the 24-year old agreement, as President Trump has threatened to do.\u201cThere isn\u2019t an easy answer, but my personal bias would be against that,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s put some lipstick on this pig, and not make a whole lot of substantial changes.\u201dHe knows that axles made here will go into vehicles exported to Mexico and other countries that are trade targets of the White House. What\u2019s more, Mexico is a major importer of corn and soybeans from American farmers, who in turn buy tractors and combines from John Deere, a major customer.\u201cDo we really understand what we\u2019re doing?\u201d Mr. Riordan asked. \u201cWe have a big trade surplus with Mexico in terms of grain. If U.S. farmers are suddenly at a disadvantage, who is going to pay the price for that? American agricultural equipment manufacturers, which impacts us.\u201dAs the steward of a manufacturer that has survived world wars, the Great Depression, the Great Recession and a couple of trips to bankruptcy court, Mr. Riordan is much more optimistic about his company\u2019s ability to compete globally than many of his workers.The same goes for the country\u2019s ability to win in trade with the likes of Mexico or China.\u201cIf rational minds prevail in Washington, over time the country will get it right,\u201d Mr. Riordan said. \u201cBut Congress and the president need to get it right in the meantime.\u201dRobert Gebeloff contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

The arrests, he said, were based on three years of investigations that produced \u201cvery large\u201d evidence.It was unclear which body had carried out the investigations since the Supreme Anti-Corruption Committee that is leading the campaign was created only hours before the first arrests were made on Saturday.No charges have been publicly specified, and it is not clear what legal process would be used to prosecute the accused. Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy, whose judicial system follows Shariah law and has no notable record of trying corruption cases.The government has said the anti-corruption campaign was a necessary part of Prince Mohammed\u2019s efforts to clean up the economy to attract international investors. Analysts, however, have said that the arrests could scare investors and international companies.Sheikh Saud\u2019s statement sought to reassure investors that the kingdom\u2019s financial system was functioning normally despite the arrests, noting that the finances of those under arrest had been frozen but not those of their businesses.\u201cNormal commercial activity in the kingdom is not affected by these investigations,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly personal bank accounts have been suspended. Companies and banks are free to continue with transactions as usual.\u201dBut administration officials have been vague over what they know about the details of the Saudi prosecutions.Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters in Washington on Thursday that Secretary of State Rex W.

{"Headline": "Lower Corporate Taxes, Higher Wages? Voters Are Skeptical", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublicans argue that their plan to cut corporate taxes will increase wages for American workers. A new survey suggests even the party\u2019s strongest supporters aren\u2019t buying that argument.The House of Representatives could vote this week on a plan that would fulfill a longtime Republican promise to cut taxes on businesses and overhaul the corporate tax system more broadly. The Senate is considering its own plan, which differs in its details but would likewise reduce the tax rate on corporate earnings to 20 percent from 35 percent.The public appears to have similar doubts, and its skepticism stretches across the political spectrum.\u201cThere\u2019s this widespread disbelief among Republicans, as there is among Democrats and independents, that tax cuts for employers will redound to their pockets books,\u201d said Jon Cohen, vice president of survey research for SurveyMonkey.In general, opinions of the Republican plan split predictably along partisan lines. More than 80 percent of Republicans said they supported the plan, and more than 80 percent of Democrats said they opposed it. Most Republicans likewise said they believed that they would benefit personally from the plan, while few Democrats believed the same.Republicans still have time to win over skeptics. Only about a quarter of respondents to the Times survey said they were paying close attention to the tax plan. But in a potential sign of trouble for the bill, people who said they were watching the process closely were more likely to oppose it \u2014 and to oppose it strongly \u2014 than those paying less attention.\u201cA lot of voters still have only weak views, but the people who have formed strong opinions already are quite negative,\u201d said Guy Molyneux, a partner at Hart Research, a Democratic polling firm.Cutting corporate taxes could be a particularly tough sell for many voters. Polls have repeatedly found that Americans think corporations, and especially big corporations, already pay too little in taxes. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a prominent conservative economist who supports overhauling the corporate tax system, said it is easy to convince voters that they should support tax cuts for middle-class families. The case for cutting corporate tax rates is harder to explain.\u201cIf you have a complicated argument like that, you have to lay the groundwork months, years in advance,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. That work hasn\u2019t been done in this case, he added.The complexity of the argument for corporate taxes may help explain why backers of the Republican plan have leaned into a simple formulation of their argument case: Lower business taxes mean higher wages. But Vanessa Williamson, a researcher at the Brookings Institution who has studied public opinion on taxation, said voters were likely to be skeptical of that argument.In general, Ms. Williamson said, voters tend to fall back on their partisan positions when forming opinions on complex subjects such as taxation. But they might depart from those partisan views when they directly contradict their own experience. Experience, Ms. Williamson said, might lead Americans to doubt that their employers will respond to lower taxes by raising pay.\u201cOnce you get to people\u2019s actual paychecks, you\u2019re confronting them with a question where they actually have personal information,\u201d Ms. Williamson said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wind and Solar Power Advance, but Carbon Refuses to Retreat", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis statistic, alone, puts a big question mark over the strategies deployed around the world to replace fossil energy. In a nutshell: Perhaps renewables are not the answer.Still, except for very limited exceptions, all this wind and sun has not brought about much decarbonization. Indeed, it has not added much clean power to the grid.It is true that Germans would have made more progress in the battle against climate change had they kept their nuclear reactors running and shut plants burning lignite instead. Still, there are other reasons behind renewables\u2019 poor track record in decarbonizing electricity.Nuclear power faces hurdles beyond popular mistrust. Notably, reactors require a lot of capital up front. But renewables have a hard time producing power at a nuclear scale.Integrating renewable sources requires vast investments in electricity transmission \u2014 to move power from intermittently windy and sunny places to places where power is consumed. It requires maintaining a backstop of idle plants that burn fossil fuel, for the times when there is no wind or sun to be had. It requires investing in power-storage systems at a large scale.Another concern is that they will drive wholesale energy prices down too far. Because they produce the most energy when the sun is up and the wind is blowing, renewable generators can flood the grid at critical times of the day, slashing the price of power. This not only threatens the solvency of nuclear reactors, which cannot shut down on a dime and must therefore pay for the grid to accept their power, but also reduces the return on additional investment in renewables.The diplomats in Bonn may be tempted to wave away these concerns. Thomas Bruckner of the University of Leipzig argues that in the case of Germany, expanding renewables to supply 80 percent of power by 2050 is \u201cnot a significant burden.\u201d Heavy German investment in renewable energy technologies over the last decade succeeded in bringing prices down, he contends; it will be much cheaper to go the rest of the way.Two years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, the world remains far off course from preventing drastic global warming in the decades ahead.Perhaps. But there is some evidence that among investors, at least, the excitement may be waning. After half a decade of sustained increases, investment in solar and wind energy has been fairly flat since 2010, at around $250 billion per year. While that is a lot of money, it is nowhere near enough.\u201cWe will need twice as much investment over a sustained period of time to get anywhere close to achieving 2 degrees,\u201d said Ethan Zindler, head of Bloomberg New Energy Finance in the Americas, referring to the objective of the world\u2019s climate diplomats: keep the average world temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above its average in the late 19th century.I would suggest that the challenge is not just to raise more money. Building a zero-carbon energy system requires broader thinking about the technological mix.An earlier version of this column included an outdated affiliation for Lion Hirth, who conducted a study on the value of wind power.

{"Headline": "Republicans May Use Cuts in Entitlement Programs to Reduce Deficit", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican lawmakers have largely dismissed concerns about how their $1.5 trillion tax cut would add to the federal deficit. Now, some Democrats are warning that the tax rewrite would ultimately be financed by gutting entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.The possibility of cuts to safety net programs appeared more likely on Tuesday, as the Congressional Budget Office warned that the tax bill could set off an arcane budget rule that would make deep cuts to Medicare over the next decade.Republican lawmakers have turned a blind eye to the effect of the tax bill on the deficit, saying the tax cuts would essentially pay for themselves through increased economic growth.But the party of deficit hawks is beginning to once again complain about the ballooning federal deficit, suggesting that spending cuts must be enforced to reduce the national debt, which has surpassed $20 trillion.At a town hall-style event in Virginia on Tuesday night, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, said the most important steps that could be taken to reduce the national debt were spurring economic growth and making changes to entitlement programs.\u201cYou cannot get the national debt under control, you cannot get that deficit under control, if you don\u2019t do both: grow the economy, cut spending,\u201d said Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.The Republican tax plan, he said \u201cgrows the economy. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in cutting spending.\u201dDemocrats said the tax bill was opening the door to the kind of entitlement cuts that Republicans had long wanted to pursue.\u201cThis is a nasty, two-step strategy that has long been the holy grail for hard-right Republicans,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader. \u201cIf this bill passes, you can bet the Republicans will immediately sharpen the knives for middle-class benefits.\u201dThe Congressional Budget Office said on Tuesday that a law passed in 2010 would necessitate cuts to Medicare of as much as $25 billion next year. The pay-as-you-go law requires that legislation that adds to the federal deficit be paid for with spending cuts or other offsets. If that does not happen, automatic cuts to programs like Medicare kick in. The Medicare cuts, which are capped at 4 percent of the program\u2019s annual spending, could reach almost a half trillion dollars over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The cuts can be averted through bipartisan legislation, though it is unclear whether Republicans would go along with such workarounds.\u201cI can\u2019t believe how quickly the deficit hawks in the Republican Party flew away after they saw the $1.5 trillion,\u201d Mr. Wyden said of the lost revenues that Republicans have approved in their tax plan. \u201cWe\u2019re sure that they will start making their way back when we see the deficits.\u201dFiscal conservatives in the House and the Senate have long wanted to rein in spending on such programs but have had to temper those desires this year now that President Trump, who promised as a candidate not to touch entitlement programs, is in office.But Mr. Trump showed some flexibility on the matter this year when he supported a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act that would have cut Medicaid funding. And in recent weeks, Republican leaders have quietly started to indicate that if they succeed in passing tax cuts, they will, in fact, look to overhaul government welfare programs.The dozens of changes in the legislation would add more than $1.4 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said this month that tax overhaul \u201calone won\u2019t get us back to a balanced budget.\u201d He said that House Republicans would soon turn toward \u201cwelfare reform and tackling the entitlements.\u201dSome Republican senators have also expressed interest in turning to spending cuts afterward.\u201cYes, we waste an enormous amount of money in the federal budget,\u201d said Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho. He said that government personnel should be cut along with Medicare and Social Security.Top White House officials have also suggested that the administration is willing to get on board with entitlement changes. In an interview with CNBC last week, Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, said that the president was focused on taxes, deregulation and infrastructure and that changes to safety net programs would follow.\u201cI think when he gets done with those, I think welfare is going to come up,\u201d Mr. Cohn said.If Republicans pass their tax bill and their optimistic projections about economic growth do not come to pass, they will face pressure to address the deficit and cut spending.Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that he was concerned about the effect of the tax bill on deficits and that it added to the urgency to scale back programs like Medicare.\u201cTax reform is looking like it will make our long-term debt more problematic, and the long-term driver of our debt is increases in entitlement spending,\u201d said Mr. Strain, who argued that it was a better use of resources to cut corporate taxes than to increase funding for entitlements.If Republicans decide to try to circumvent the pay-as-you-go rule, it could be taken as a sign that they are not serious about deficit reduction. For Democrats, it could be enticing to show the public the consequences of Republican-driven tax cuts, but it would be difficult for them to essentially support cuts to a government program that provides health insurance for the elderly.\u201cAt the end of the day, it is somewhat akin to the debt limit that no one actually wants to let it happen,\u201d said Ed Lorenzen, a senior adviser for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, who noted that spending would eventually have to be addressed if Republicans used the deficit to finance tax cuts.For now, Republicans are playing down the likelihood that Medicare cuts will come to pass.\u201cNo such thing is going to be triggered automatically,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania.Advertisement"}

Powell to succeed Ms. Yellen as the Fed\u2019s chairman.On Tuesday, Ms. Yellen kept a longstanding engagement to be interviewed on a stage at the Stern School of Business by Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England.In one of her final public appearances as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Ms. Yellen answered questions about policy in her trademark clear and steady style that has eliminated much of the guesswork that was once required to divine the Fed\u2019s intentions.She said the Fed was still inclined to raise interest rates gradually as it sought to balance the risks of moving too fast and moving too slowly. The Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point at its final policy meeting of the year in mid-December. The rate now sits in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.Ms. Yellen noted the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.1 percent as of October, which the Fed regards as a little lower than the minimum level that can be sustained without spurring inflation.Some Fed officials also want to raise rates to discourage speculation in financial markets, and to increase the Fed\u2019s ability to respond to economic downturns.On the other hand, the Fed sees little reason to rush. The economy is not overheating, inflation is below 2 percent, and the Fed does not want to stall growth.As she approaches her last day at the Fed, Ms. Yellen recalled her first: Feb. 3, 2014. She described a small swearing-in ceremony \u2014 a larger public event was held a few weeks later \u2014 followed by a quick turn to work, beginning with recording a video message to her staff.Mr. King asked whether she paused for a little Champagne. Ms. Yellen laughed and responded, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a work day after all, Mervyn. We saved that for a family treat in the evening.\u201dShe said working at the Fed had been a \u201ctotal pleasure.\u201dMs. Yellen\u2019s tenure has been defined by her campaign to reduce unemployment. \u201cI\u2019m very interested in the job market, and a lot of my career has been spent studying unemployment and trying to understand how we can lower it,\u201d she said.Mr. King also noted that the Fed under Ms. Yellen had continued an evolution toward greater transparency. Central banks once adhered to a philosophy that Mr. King described as \u201ckeep the press out of the bank and keep the bank out of the press.\u201dBut in recent decades, banks have adopted the opposite view. It is now conventional wisdom that effective policy requires management of public expectations.Ms. Yellen said communication had been a central element of her job: explaining the Fed to lay audiences, defending its policies before Congress, calibrating expectations in financial markets.Much of the conversation was lighthearted. Mr. King, noting that Ms. Yellen is married to an economist and that her son is also an economist, asked what she did to get away from economics.Ms. Yellen responded, \u201cNow, why would you want to do that?\u201dShe said that her family not only discussed economics at the dinner table, they also sometimes carried the conversations \u2014 and academic papers \u2014 to the beach.Ms. Yellen\u2019s husband, George Akerlof, was a co-author on some of her early work, and she said that he had continued to play an important role in her career by supporting her turn toward public policy. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve been offered jobs in Washington, for example, his attitude has been, \u2018You want to do that? Absolutely we\u2019re going to make it work,\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen did, however, name Mr. Akerlof as the most interesting person she had ever met.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Lets Interest Rate Stand Ahead of Powell Nomination as Chairman", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday and signaled another rate increase is very likely to come in mid-December. But hanging over the meeting was the anticipation of a much bigger change: The nomination of Jerome H. Powell as the next Fed chairman.Mr. Powell, a Republican who joined the Fed in 2012, has steadily supported Ms. Yellen\u2019s approach to monetary policy and is expected to follow a similar trajectory if confirmed to lead the central bank. Mr. Powell has voted for every Fed policy decision since 2012, including its four interest rate increases and the gradual unwinding of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign.The Fed is approaching the process cautiously, and so far investors appear unfazed. The central bank is paring its $4.2 trillion in bond holdings by just $10 billion per month through the end of this year, then gradually increasing the pace until it reaches a monthly rate of $50 billion.At the conclusion of its two-day gathering in Washington, the Fed announced that it would leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1 and 1.25 percent, after lifting it twice so far this year. The vote was unanimous, and the central bank did not alter any of the careful wording in its statement about its expected rate of future increases \u2014 a sign that it is not trying to quell widely held expectations of a rate increase of a quarter point in December.\u201cThey\u2019re on track to raise rates in December,\u201d said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities.In its statement, the Fed said economic activity had been rising \u201cat a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions.\u201d It said that the hurricanes had caused a drop in payrolls in September and a pickup in inflation because of higher gasoline prices, but that it expected both effects to be temporary, and that the storms would be \u201cunlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term.\u201d\u201cMuch of the uncertainty that had existed at the September meetings because of the hurricanes has subsided and signs are that growth has been stronger,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.Still, at some point \u201ctemporary\u201d effects stop looking so temporary. The Fed will get several more reports on inflation before its December meeting, and it remains possible that weak data could give policymakers pause.But Ken Matheny, executive director of Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit, was less certain that a December rise was inevitable. He said that the Fed was struggling to reconcile strong growth with weak inflation, and that policymakers would be watching coming inflation data closely in making their interest-rate decisions.\u201cA December rate hike is not a foregone conclusion,\u201d Mr. Matheny said, adding that the market\u2019s overwhelming confidence in an increase was \u201ca puzzle.\u201dPolicymakers and investors have also been watching closely for any signs that the Fed\u2019s long-awaited process of drawing down on its $4.2 trillion balance sheet is disrupting financial markets. In 2013, interest rates spiked unexpectedly in response to the Fed\u2019s announcement that it would begin slowing its bond purchases, a reaction that came to be known as the \u201ctaper tantrum.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re very relieved at the reaction they got,\u201d said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.Investors said the nomination of Mr. Powell would mean that the Fed was likely to continue on its current course.A former Treasury Department official under President George H.W. Bush and a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, Mr. Powell emerged as the front-runner for the position in recent weeks from a diverse group of finalists. That group included Gary Cohn, a close economic adviser to the president; John B. Taylor, an economist who is a vocal critic of the Fed; and Ms. Yellen herself.Ana Swanson reported from Washington, and Ben Casselman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Remains on Track to Raise Interest Rates Next Month", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is preparing to raise its benchmark interest rate in December despite the concerns of some Fed officials about the persistent weakness of inflation, according to an account of the Fed\u2019s most recent policy meeting.At the two-day meeting that ended Nov. 1, those officials were \u201creasonably confident that the economy and inflation would evolve in coming months such that an additional firming would likely be appropriate in the near term,\u201d the Fed said.The group made no changes to monetary policy at the meeting; it had signaled in advance of the meeting that it would not act before December. It left its benchmark rate in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent, and did not alter the instructions for the gradual reduction of its $4 trillion portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds now underway.But the meeting account, released after a standard three-week delay, is likely to solidify investor expectations that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point at the December meeting.The continued debate about the weakness of inflation has divided officials into two broad camps. Most, including Ms. Yellen, regard slow inflation as somewhat mysterious but not a cause for great concern because they expect tightening labor market conditions to eventually drive up prices. As a result, they want to keep raising interest rates at a gradual pace.The unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent in October and the pace of job growth remains strong. The account described it as \u201cwell above the pace likely to be sustainable in the longer run.\u201dBy most conventional measures, Ms. Yellen\u2019s four years as the nation\u2019s top monetary policymaker have been a success.A minority of Fed officials, however, have become increasingly forceful in registering their concerns. Those officials are more worried about moving too fast than too slow. They fear that the persistence of sluggish inflation could damage the economy, for example, by permanently eroding public expectations about the future pace of inflation.The minutes said that some of those officials are reluctant to vote for additional rate increases until they are convinced that inflation is indeed gaining strength.The officials \u201cindicated that their decision about whether to increase the target range in the near term would depend importantly on whether the upcoming economic data boosted their confidence that inflation was headed toward the Committee\u2019s objective.\u201dSome Fed officials also want to raise rates because they are concerned that financial market conditions have not tightened adequately this year, meaning credit is easier and cheaper to get than the Fed would have anticipated. The Fed raises its benchmark rate to make it more difficult to borrow money. But the rates on consumer and business loans have not climbed in response, prompting worries that investors are taking excessive risks.Fed officials also want to stockpile ammunition against future economic downturns. The Fed\u2019s primary medicine for weak growth is cutting rates, which it can do only if it has a high enough rate to cut from.The Fed has said that it intended to stick to its schedule barring significant economic disruptions, and to underscore that the unwinding is on autopilot, it may stop providing updates in its post-meeting statements.Expectations about the course of monetary policy have held steady even as the Fed prepares for a change in leadership. President Trump announced earlier this month that he would nominate Jerome H. Powell as the next Fed chairman. If he is confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Powell would replace Ms. Yellen in early February.Mr. Powell, a Fed governor, has consistently supported the gradual unwinding the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign.

This is the new normal.\u201dFrancois Franceschini was able to claim a spot on one of the first ships to leave the island after the hurricane, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship being used for humanitarian runs. He described the \u201csurvivor\u2019s guilt\u201d he felt as he ate steak and mashed potatoes in an air-conditioned state room.Mr. Franceschini thought he would join his family in New York City for only a few weeks, gathering generators and supplies, and then head back. But those plans quickly changed: Now, he and his girlfriend, who have been staying in his aunt\u2019s apartment in the Bronx, are starting to look at colleges. Puerto Rico, he said, has been \u201ctaken back to the Dark Ages.\u201d\u201cIt got genuinely scary when it became less about comfort and more about safety and health,\u201d he said. \u201cI can work with not being comfortable for a while. I can\u2019t deal with not being safe. It hurt a lot, even though my parents had already come to New York. I love Puerto Rico too much.\u201dThose leaving after the hurricane join an exodus that began well before the storm. In recent years, the Puerto Rican population on the mainland (5.4 million people) has grown far larger than the one on the island itself (3.3 million). The territory\u2019s economy had been crippled by a decade-long recession and a debt crisis that pushed the island to declare a form of bankruptcy this year and forced many, faced with dwindling work prospects and a decreasing quality of life, to head north.\u201cThe minute we got into the law school, we knew there was a very minimal amount of jobs we could acquire as lawyers working in a firm there already,\u201d said Lourdes Carreras-Ortiz, a University of Puerto Rico law student.But before the storm, Ms. Alers-Ortiz said, many Puerto Ricans were able to maintain at least the facade of a middle-class life: They had cellphones, went to the movies, shopped for clothes at Plaza Las Am\u00e9ricas, a sprawling mall in San Juan. The storm washed that away. \u201cOur first-world mask has been ripped off,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re third world.\u201d\u201cThe feeling is life stopped,\u201d she added.Members of the diaspora, even recent arrivals, argue that they can contribute to Puerto Rico\u2019s recovery from afar. They point to a surge of money and supplies, and they said they can push elected officials to direct more aid to the island.Aja Nelson had been displaced twice: She fled St. Thomas, one of the United States Virgin Islands, for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma, only to be pushed out again by Maria. Now, Ms. Nelson is staying with relatives in Atlanta.\u201cI am just shellshocked,\u201d she said.Jose Manuel Ure\u00f1a, 24, had been a cook for the last two years at a restaurant in Condado, an upscale area of San Juan that had been popular with tourists, and also helped his brother take care of their mother. He said he had lost his job and a friend promised to help him find work in a kitchen in Newark, where he was heading.\u201cMy plan is to get to New Jersey and work until I can\u2019t anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to have a home again.\u201d\u201cThe Puerto Rican way of life is gone as we know it,\u201d Mr. Camacho-Vazquez said. \u201cThis is a fact.\u201dThe grim situation on the island has forced the students, who are mostly in their third year of law school, to reassess their plans after they graduate and whatever obligation they have to Puerto Rico.\u201cI don\u2019t owe the government anything, but I do owe my island something,\u201d Ms. Carreras-Ortiz said as she sat with her classmates on campus one recent afternoon. \u201cI lived there. I grew up there. The place \u2014 not only physically the island but the people, the life there \u2014 it gave me so much, and I\u2019m the person I am because I lived on the island.\u201d\u201cI do want to go back for Puerto Rico,\u201d she added. \u201cIf everybody who can do something just leaves, the island is gone. There\u2019s no progress.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d another student, Cesar Rivera, interjected. \u201cThat is very admirable, but those who leave, I cannot blame.\u201dSandra E.

And the other is a family man who spends his spare time building housing for the poor, who never even dated anybody before his wife of 35 years.But the hound dog is as close as a politician has ever come to supporting your exact hopes and dreams when it comes to both domestic policy and international affairs. And the man of honor is running on all the ideas you hate: say, a platform of doubling domestic spending and paying for it with new taxes on business. Plus he hangs out with every foreign leader who gives you nightmares. Which way would you go?By the way, imagine if Clinton had been removed from office. Al Gore (in his centrist political incarnation) would have become president, presiding over the same Goldilocks economy that served Clinton so well. As an incumbent he would probably have sailed to election in his own right in 2000. Later, John McCain (minus Sarah Palin) might have won the presidency instead of George W. Bush, Barack Obama might have succeeded him \u2014 and Trump would never have been president.Doesn\u2019t sound like such a bad counterfactual, doesn\u2019t it?Alabama is complicated because Roy Moore is so revolting both morally and politically \u2014 as Senator Jeff Flake said, way before the sex-assault arguments arose, you cannot support a person who talks about Muslims and gay people the way Moore does.But I\u2019m not giving up on my policy-versus-character quandary. In 1980, the Christian right happily elected the first divorced president over Jimmy Carter, the deeply religious, loyal family man \u2014 because Ronald Reagan was going to do the stuff they wanted. We had a much different system of electing presidents back in 1800, but a lot of the people who voted for Thomas Jefferson most definitely knew he had a slave for a mistress.If Republicans know what\u2019s good for them, they should be praying for Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, to win the special election next month by a landslide. Only that will teach them the lesson they\u2019ve so far refused to learn from Trump.And if that leaves Roy Moore at an unfair disadvantage, I\u2019d have to say it couldn\u2019t have happened to a better guy.In the meantime, the Virginia election in particular has shown that there\u2019s more than negativity to anti-Trumpism. Many people voted for the principle that we\u2019re all in this together, that nobody is unwelcome because of their race or religion or sexual orientation. And that victory for basic civility takes us a long way.You\u2019re in Germany right now, yes? Speaking of countries that are careening around, what the heck is going on there?The larger and more worrisome answer is that the political center in Germany is growing weaker while the fringes grow stronger. The big winner in the last election was the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which resembles France\u2019s National Front in its xenophobic and fascist impulses. The Left party, whose origins lie partly with the old East German Communists, is also gaining strength.In other words, the same centrifugal forces that are tearing at the politics of the United States and Britain are also being felt in Europe\u2019s most important country. It isn\u2019t a happy picture to contemplate on the eve of Thanksgiving.Speaking of which, what are you feeling thankful for this year?How about you?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the Saudi Crown Prince Transform the Kingdom?", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe House of Saud realized the volatility of the state religion. But instead of trying to de-radicalize the radicals, the regime chose to indulge them and submit to their uncompromising agenda.The Camp David agreement between Israel and Egypt in 1979 also troubled many Saudis. Consequently, Saudi Arabia together with other Arab countries boycotted Egypt under pressure from local groups.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 provided an opportunity for Saudi Arabia to outdo Iran\u2019s Islamic republic in displaying Islamic credentials.Saudi Arabia wanted to defuse the religious radicalism at home by letting its own jihadis seek martyrdom in Afghanistan. This eventually led to the emergence of global jihad under the leadership of Osama bin Laden.Notwithstanding Prince Mohammed\u2019s sweeping and inaccurate comments about Saudi religious moderation before 1979, it is not clear how moderate Islam is going to change the religious outlook. If he is serious about getting the country to embrace moderate Islam, he must allow Saudi clerics and thinkers of different denominations to debate foundational Islamic texts and norms in an open environment.Saudi religious education is still based on the Wahhabi heritage and judges follow the Hanbali jurisprudence, the foundation of Wahhabi literal interpretations of Islam. The founder of Wahhabism, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, is sacrosanct. When a scholar named Hijazi Hasan Farhan al-Maliki wrote a book suggesting that readers temper their unconditional endorsement of Wahhab, he was arrested.Saudi Arabia is still the only country in the Muslim world where non-Muslim places of worship are not allowed. Even in neighboring Gulf countries, Hindu temples and Christian churches exist. The crown prince did not hint whether that would change under the new moderate Islam he envisages.Moderate Islam will not emerge in Saudi Arabia under a repressive regime whose foundation is based on purging theological difference and criminalizing the Muslim other. The regime\u2019s main interest in religion is to gain legitimacy and pacify the Saudi population as Wahhabism justifies armed rebellion abroad against most Muslim leaders, but forbids Saudis from rising up against their own rulers.Only open debate will eventually lead to a kind of Islamic modernism and shrink the spaces where fundamentalism grows. But the regime will then be left without its raison d\u2019\u00eatre, as the protector of faith, defender of Muslims and the only truly Islamic state.Prince Mohammed will need a new legitimacy narrative to sell absolute rule to the populace. Economic development and employment opportunities may be key but since the new city he\u2019s promoting will rely more on robots than humans, there is little hope there for young Saudis in search of a livelihood.The recent announcements about moderate Islam, the pervasive arrests, and the illusory hypermodern economic projects frame him as a ruthless modernizer, who is struggling to achieve too many things in too little time. But his motive is more about the consolidation of power than about corruption.Madawi al-Rasheed, a visiting professor at London School of Economics, is the author, most recently, of \u201cMuted Modernists: The Struggle Over Divine Politics in Saudi Arabia.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Generation Grumpy: Why You May Be Unhappy if You\u2019re Around 50", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe generation of people born 1962 to 1971, now in what are typically peak earning years, are finding they are not doing as well as they might have expected.As people get older, they tend to become more at peace with their finances, survey research shows. But not the current crop of middle-aged Americans. Let\u2019s call them the Grumpy Middle.They are unhappier than previous generations. And they\u2019ve been this way for years.Typically, people 45 to 54 are more likely than others to say they are \u201cpretty well satisfied\u201d with their financial situation, according to NORC at the University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey. Then the generation born between 1962 and 1971 started to reach their current age range \u2014 and bring their longstanding economic dissatisfaction with them.By 2016, as middle-aged Americans, they were 12 percent less likely to say they were satisfied financially, and 18 percent more likely to say they were unhappy. (Respondents can also give a neutral answer.)Following the Grumpy Middle over time in the survey reveals that they have been less happy than other respondents as far back as the early 1990s, when most of them were in their 20s.Americans in their 20s and 30s have always expressed a higher degree of anxiety, but this is the first time in the survey that the dissatisfaction has crept so far up into middle age. The General Social Survey does not dig deeper on this and ask why. And other variables that touch on personal happiness don\u2019t suggest people born between these years are more unhappy over all.But when it comes to money, a look at economic data begins to yield some clues.Back in 1994, when the baby boom generation was filling in the 45-54 age group, a male full-time worker made $1.29 for every dollar made by other male full-time workers. Women in this age group were also the top earners, although female pay was not as disparate; they made $1.13 for every dollar made by other female colleagues.Today, women still face a big pay gap with men, but among female workers there\u2019s still less age disparity. For both genders, however, older workers \u2014 especially the rapidly growing pool of boomers over age 65 \u2014 are holding a growing share of the high-paying jobs.The Grumpy Middle got to college around the time the drinking age was raised to 21 and were too young to enjoy all of the benefits of the booming 1980s economy, but old enough to have worked with older colleagues who could regale them with tales of how great things were for white-collar workers in the 1980s.And now they\u2019ve reached their peak earning years, only to find they are no longer peak earning years.Put another way: America is getting older. But American wealth is aging even faster.As recently as 2010, Americans 65 and older made up about a fifth of the population but a third of the wealthy population (those ranking above the 95th percentile).And older Americans have grown wealthier since, with a net gain of 750,000 spots in the top 5 percent. The number of 5 percenters below age 55 dropped by about 440,000. Older people are staying in full-time, high-paying jobs a lot longer than in the past. About 1 in 7 Americans over 65 worked full time last year, compared with 1 in 12 in 2000.They are less likely to work in sales, or on an assembly line.So although older Americans have always been far more likely to be satisfied with their finances, they\u2019re also riding a wave of increasing dominance on the income scale and hanging onto high-paying work, keeping some of those slightly younger 45-to-54-year-olds from ascending to those jobs. Maybe that\u2019s part of why that younger group is grumpy.Advertisement"}

On Saturday, a line of people waited in the rain to hear Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, Gov. Jerry Brown of California and a handful of United States senators, all Democrats, declare that much of America remains committed to reducing planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions.\u201cWe\u2019re in,\u201d said Mr. Bloomberg, who put more than $1 million toward funding the pavilion, according to his office. \u201cJust because the federal government has chosen not to participate,\u201d he added in an interview, \u201cthe American public represented by its elected officials at other levels, by corporations, by universities, we understand that there\u2019s a problem and we have to help solve that problem if we\u2019re going to have a future in this world.\u201d\u201cWe have tremendous natural resources, from coal to natural gas to oil, to generate electricity in a very cost-effective way,\u201d Mr. Pruitt told the conference. \u201cWe should celebrate that and be good stewards.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a debate in the United States between the denialists who pooh-pooh any thought about climate change and the catastrophic dangers it portends, and those who agree with the scientific academies of every country in the world that we\u2019re facing an existential threat and we have to do something about it,\u201d Governor Brown said Saturday.Two years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, the world remains far off course from preventing drastic global warming in the decades ahead.He and Mr. Bloomberg announced that the states, cities and businesses that had pledged to abide by the Paris accord were on track to meet the Obama administration pledge to cut emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.Former Vice President Al Gore, a longtime champion of strong action on climate change, said Mr. Trump represented a minority view on the subject.\u201cPresident Trump does not speak for the country as a whole on the climate issue,\u201d Mr. Gore said. \u201cOf course he\u2019s our president, of course he has the authority that any president has. But on this issue he is very much out of sync with the country as a whole.\u201dThe official American negotiating team for now is laying low.

{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Finance Minister Says He\u2019ll Run for President", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s finance minister, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, stepped down Monday and announced his intention to run for president in next year\u2019s election, assuming the coveted candidacy of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.In recent months, speculation has been rampant about whom the president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and his party would select as the party\u2019s candidate.The president, who is limited to a single term of six years, has received some of the lowest approval ratings in the country\u2019s recent history amid corruption scandals, record-breaking violence and a sluggish economy \u2014 making the selection of a candidate to succeed him a delicate matter.Mr. Meade, 48, holds a doctorate in economics from Yale and is seen as a capable technocrat with a wide range of experience. He has held several cabinet-level positions in rival administrations, making him an attractive selection for the governing party, also known as the PRI, which wanted someone with a clean record.Under Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Mr. Meade oversaw the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Social Development Ministry. He also served under Felipe Calder\u00f3n, who preceded Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and was a member of the opposition National Action Party, or PAN, as both energy minister and finance minister.Mr. Meade is, in the eyes of most analysts, the safest bet for the party, which governed Mexico for some 70 years until 2000 and struggles with a reputation for corruption and for wielding a heavy hand when in power. He was not dogged by scandal or controversy during any of the administrations he served in, unlike some of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s other cabinet members.\u201cWe are talking about someone who is highly efficient in managing high-level bureaucracy, enjoys a good public image and has a steady dialogue with both the opposition conservative PAN party and the PRI, without being a militant of either,\u201d said Fernando Dworak, a political analyst.Mr. Meade has kept a low profile and is not officially affiliated with any political party. He has never run for public office, and his speeches are highly technical and, to some, highly boring.A big question for the candidate will be whether his stellar credentials and scandal-free record will be enough to overcome his relatively low-energy demeanor.Although Mr. Meade is not the most popular possible candidate among the party\u2019s base, analysts say, party officials hope he will ultimately attract voters from the PAN, which could help fend off the party\u2019s left-wing rival, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a top contender, who represents a third party.The decision by the PRI to put forth a candidate with a clean public record and credibility in the business community comes at a moment of increasing dissatisfaction and distrust with political leaders in Mexico.\u201cIt is yet another piece of evidence of the PRI\u2019s profound credibility crisis, so much that they had to turn to someone who is not even affiliated and yet will help calm down the markets, while guaranteeing the survival of the establishment,\u201d said Genaro Lozano a professor at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City.Still, having served the entire term under the current administration, Mr. Meade cannot entirely escape scrutiny. His critics accuse him of being opportunistic and accuse him of having taken part in covering up alleged fraud and the diversion of public funds during Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s administration.The announcement came only a day after the next most probable candidate, Secretary of Interior Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, was reported to have stepped aside from the presidential race despite leading in the polls.On Monday, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto publicly expressed his regard for Mr. Meade, praising his \u201coutstanding\u201d performance as the head of three different government agencies during his administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What If Our Current State of Affairs Is Actually \u2018Normal\u2019?", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsAmericans, we often say, cannot agree on anything. Though we enjoy astonishing access to information about the world and about one another, we\u2019ve elected to retreat into separate, contradictory universes. At the extremes, these beliefs approach a kind of comic-book absurdity \u2014 that the victims of mass shootings are actually paid actors, or that every political development of the past four years is part of a devious foreign plot. But there is at least one thing on which almost everyone, across the entire spectrum of realities we have chosen to inhabit, can apparently agree: None of this is \u201cnormal.\u201dIt\u2019s among the ranks of Trump-averse realists that this observation has become especially common. Every alarming, precedent-shattering move emanating from the White House is met by the same warning Michelle Obama issued in a speech last October: \u201cThis is not normal.\u201d (Often, periods or emoji handclaps are inserted for emphasis: \u201cThis. Is. Not. Normal.\u201d) The mantra functions as a snappy diagnosis of a grave illness: Things are happening to our system of governance that fall outside the bounds of health and order, things that represent dire breaches of longstanding principle.Maybe it\u2019s the onslaught of appalled handclapping; maybe it\u2019s the continuing insistence that Trump and his cabinet of the hyperwealthy are just workaday Americans. Whatever the cause, there is something about the mere concept of \u201cnormal\u201d that has become faintly hilarious. In some quarters, the word\u2019s use is more likely than not to be sarcastic. Take a recent tweet from Max Marin, a reporter at Philadelphia Weekly, accompanied by a screenshot of an email promoting New Jersey as the seventh-safest state for Black Friday shopping: \u201cA totally normal press release in a totally normal country.\u201d At some point \u2014 by the time of the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, at the latest \u2014 most everything about the public sphere began to seem like a hack television writer\u2019s parody of it. What could be funnier, more strange and outlandish, than something that managed to qualify as normal?The culture wars that followed in the next decades are often seen as conservative defenses of the supposedly normal versus liberal defenses of the supposedly deviant. Over time, though, both sides have wound up with the same resistance to normalcy: Each feels oppressed by the social standards of the other. One works to dismantle beliefs that things like homosexuality or disability are abnormal; the other screams about political correctness and pledges never to accept changing social mores. (Online, the young men of the alt-right now dismiss their mainstream millennial peers as \u201cnormies.\u201d) What they share, on some level, is a culture-wide, \u201960s-born focus on liberating the individual from the tyranny of the normal.And yet now, after decades of sustained attack \u2014 during which an astonishing range of Americans came to see themselves as somehow culturally dissident \u2014 normalcy is being treated as a positive state. What\u2019s more, the word\u2019s focus shifted: Instead of focusing on how individuals ought to behave in a society, we\u2019ve turned back to looking at the health of society as a whole. We have detected within it an aberration, an irritant, that may threaten its overall health.This unease is partly emotional. A core experience of becoming an adult is the gradual realization that there is no stable force in charge of things and no natural progression by which the unimpressive young people who have always surrounded you, eating paste and binge drinking and struggling at math, will be magically transmuted into credible authority figures. The responsibility for maintaining the world falls to you and your peers. This is why your elders pressured you to learn things; they were aware that they would die and that someone would need to be able to design power plants and do heart surgery. As with international law, we might enjoy the thought that there is some coherent structure holding everything together, but in the end the structure is only as stable as we\u2019re prepared to step forward and make it.This might explain the sense of comic plaintiveness that has accumulated around the word \u201cnormal.\u201d Every indignant handclap on Twitter seems to be calling out for the adult in the room. But the only adult available here is the American public, which has turned out to be a lot more comfortable with abnormality than previously imagined.It doesn\u2019t help that Americans of all political persuasions tend to get excited by promises of sweeping, revolutionary change \u2014 or that the first chorus of voices warning against the corrosion of the system will always come from its \u201cestablishment\u201d caretakers, easily accused of trying to preserve the status quo only because they\u2019re personally invested in it. This is the unrelenting attack on old-school conservatives by the far right. It\u2019s also prevalent on the left, which suspects that centrist Democrats might be less attached to principle than to a meaningless sense of decorum. Hence the moment when George W. Bush obliquely criticized Trump in a speech he gave in October and many Democrats looked back at him with sudden nostalgia: At least he gave the appearance of respecting the system.Curtis\u2019s provocative argument is that the political and economic absurdities of the postindustrial West have been hypernormalized, too. Shortly after our most recent period of real political chaos \u2014 the violence and disorder that marked the 1970s \u2014 both governments and citizens essentially ceased trying to shape the world and settled for being able to maintain it; we placed our hopes in vast and unknowable systems of interconnected data and markets and technologies, and we simply worked to keep the gears turning. Depending on how convincing you find that notion, there\u2019s a strange implication you might draw out of it about the normal. What if people have things backward? What if, when we fret that something has gone awry with America, we are merely getting a glimpse of a dysfunction that is actually normal, and has always been normal, and has merely been papered over, for a few decades, with careful management?

{"Headline": "New Jersey\u2019s Next Governor: A Rich Donor With Progressive Roots", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "Man in the NewsBefore Philip D. Murphy was a governor, he was a Goldman Sachs executive. And before that, he was raised in a home that revered the Kennedys.Supported byASBURY PARK, N.J. \u2014 Philip Dunton Murphy bounded onto the stage here in early November amid rapturous cheers, though they were not all for him. His good friend, Jon Bon Jovi, had just blitzed through a three-song set, mixed with a brief endorsement of Mr. Murphy spoken over the chords of \u201cWho Says You Can\u2019t Go Home.\u201dFor Mr. Murphy, it was a note-perfect moment: irrefutable testimony of his New Jersey bona fides and of his progressive, working-class roots from a native son revered as a balladeer of the New Jersey working stiff.But over more than 500 days of relentless campaigning, such moments did not always come easily or naturally for Mr. Murphy, whose setting for much of his professional life has been rarefied corporate boardrooms and ornate European salons rather than rowdy campaign scenes.With his election, Mr. Murphy becomes the first Democrat to occupy the governor\u2019s office in eight years, further cementing New Jersey\u2019s shift to a decidedly blue state and giving a man who spent years on the periphery as an influential financial contributor his first chance at the political spotlight. He takes over a state where many are disillusioned and angry at the way the outgoing Republican governor, Chris Christie, has left New Jersey, riddled with debt, schools bereft of funding, exorbitant property taxes and a dismal public transit system.Mr. Murphy, 60, grew up in a modest Irish home in Newton, Mass., raised on Catholic values of social justice that were reinforced with trips to church every Sunday. Part of a family of four, he occasionally had to share a bedroom, and he got his first job washing dishes when he was 13. His family revered the Kennedys \u2014 any speech by John F. Kennedy or Robert F. Kennedy was cause to huddle around the television.Though he never ran for student government in grade school or high school, politics were a constant in his early life, from dinner table discussions to time spent with his grandfather \u2014 \u201cHonest John\u201d \u2014 the chairman of the Newton Board of Assessors.\u201cI think there\u2019s a continual thread of progressive Democratic principles that the family always stood by,\u201d his sister, Dorothy Murphy Egan, 70, recalled. \u201cI think that\u2019s the absolute truth.\u201dMr. Murphy\u2019s father never graduated from high school, and throughout his childhood his mother stressed the need for a good education. Despite his family\u2019s love of politics, Mr. Murphy felt a stronger pull toward the stage during college. At Harvard, he quickly rose to become president of the Hasty Pudding Club, a famed theatrical club where he shared sketches and dance numbers with two future politicians, Charlie Baker, the current Republican governor of Massachusetts, and Deval Patrick, a former Democratic governor.His love for showmanship would blend into his professional life \u2014 from performing karaoke with Goldman Sachs colleagues to singing \u201cTouch Me\u2019\u2019 by The Doors at a recent campaign rally \u2014 but rather than pursue a career in theater, Mr. Murphy opted for the more lucrative world of finance, where he amassed a personal fortune during a more than 20-year career at Goldman Sachs.It was during his time at Goldman that he met his wife, Tammy. They had known each other through shared social circles for years. But after a whirlwind first date in London, they were engaged just 18 days later. They now have four children, three boys and one girl, and live in a $9.5 million home in Red Bank, near the Jersey Shore.After stints as head of Goldman Sachs Germany and Goldman Sachs Asia that were considered largely successful, Mr. Murphy moved with his wife to New Jersey in 2000. They immediately took an interest in the local political scene, nurturing and financially supporting candidates who aligned with their center-left positions, leading them to a rising political star in Essex County: Cory Booker.\u201cIt was sometime in 2002 where he really just came to my aid,\u201d Mr. Booker said in an interview. Mr. Booker had just lost his upstart bid to unseat the mayor of Newark, Sharpe James, a powerful incumbent hampered by controversy, and the defeat, combined with a documentary that was made about the rough-and-tumble race, led him to question whether politics was for him. He spent time at the Murphys\u2019 home, licking his wounds while they tried to buoy his spirits.\u201cHe was one of those guys who just really encouraged me at that time to just not give up,\u201d Mr. Booker said.In those years, with Mr. Murphy having to devote time and energy to his responsibilities at Goldman, he largely kept to the political sidelines. It was not until Gov. Richard Codey, a Democrat, tapped him in 2005 to tackle the state\u2019s growing property tax crisis that Mr. Murphy felt the first pangs to run for office himself.He spent six months on the project as chairman of a state commission, eventually delivering a scathing report on the state\u2019s finances and pension system and lofty goals for addressing the problems.\u201cI think that was a moment that really hurt him, because I think he felt like he had expended a lot of personal capital trying to help to come up with some solutions, and I think he felt like he had come up with some solutions,\u201d Ms. Murphy recalled. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said this, but I would go back to that moment and say that I think that was the real moment where he basically said, \u2018You know what? You have to have skin in the game.\u2019\u201dHe quickly moved through the ranks of the Democratic Party, from a deep-pocketed donor to finance chair for the Democratic National Committee, where he faced an existential crisis: trying to heal the rift in 2008 between supporters of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton following a bruising primary campaign, one that left many Clinton donors wounded ahead of a challenging general election battle against John McCain.\u201cThere was one dinner in Miami, and it was quite contentious,\u201d recalled Tom McMahon, the former executive director of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe Hillary donors felt like we, the D.N.C., had put our thumb on the scale for Barack Obama. Phil interjected himself, recalibrated and answered the two or three points that this donor was hammering me on.\u201dMr. Murphy managed to loosen the donor\u2019s wallet. \u201cHe may have gotten a check that week,\u201d Mr. McMahon said.Though Mr. Murphy may have harbored aspirations for public office, they went unnoticed by his Democratic Party colleagues.\u201cIf you would have told me 10 years ago that Phil would one day run for office, I would have been surprised,\u201d Mr. McMahon said. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a lot of individuals who identify as politicians. Phil has not fit that role as the stereotype of the people who are constantly trying to be self-seekers.\u201dInstead, Mr. Murphy\u2019s performance as the party\u2019s finance chair turned into an appointment by President Obama as the German ambassador, where he weathered a modest scandal triggered by leaks of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks in which Mr. Murphy offered unflattering descriptions of German politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel.After four years in Germany, Mr. Murphy returned home to New Jersey in 2013, at a time when Mr. Christie was one of the most popular governors in the country.But he and his wife saw an opening \u2014 an increasingly stagnant state economy \u2014 that they might seize on to build an outside shot at a campaign.And indeed, from the very beginning, before any candidate had officially announced, Mr. Murphy was considered a long-shot, who would struggle to find a path to the nomination against better-known and established Democrats, like Steven Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City, and Stephen M. Sweeney, the State Senate president. But after some deft political maneuvering that yielded key endorsements and large checks written to county Democratic committees, the Murphy campaign was able to force Mr. Fulop out of the race, and, by uniting Democrats in northern New Jersey, left Mr. Sweeney, who is based in the southern part of the state, no clear path to victory.From that moment, the election became Mr. Murphy\u2019s to lose. He then had to energize an electorate dejected and exhausted by President Trump\u2019s stunning victory last November and a Democratic Party still struggling to find direction.His speeches rarely contained any detailed discussions of policy. Instead, they were largely proclamations and promises designed to rally a base hungry for a victory that would provide solace amid so much rancor over the policies and words emanating from the White House.Eager to please, he ran a campaign marked by an extended list of promises \u2014 to organized labor, to progressive party activists, to environmentalists, to immigrants, to disenchanted Democrats, to the poor, to commuters.And as governor, Mr. Murphy may find that his desire to be well-liked and attuned to the needs of his many disparate constituencies runs counter to the difficult decisions he will need to make as chief executive in a state that has largely been left out of the economic recovery.But even while he struggled to energize voters, Mr. Murphy heads to Trenton with a characteristic that friends, colleagues and relatives tend to cite first in describing him \u2014 boundless energy.For now, Mr. Murphy seems to relish his opportunity to step onto a big stage.\u201cI saw him down for St. Patrick\u2019s Day in Belmar, and he was thoroughly enjoying himself,\u201d said James E. McGreevey, a former Democratic governor. \u201cYou don\u2019t have six hundred people drinking Harp at Goldman Sachs every week.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the political party for Gov. Charlie Baker. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Commerce Secretary\u2019s Offshore Ties to Putin \u2018Cronies\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "The Paradise PapersWilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, retained investments in a shipping firm with business ties to Russian President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle.Supported byAfter becoming commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross Jr. retained investments in a shipping firm he once controlled that has significant business ties to a Russian oligarch subject to American sanctions and President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s son-in-law, according to newly disclosed documents.In addition to Mr. Ross, the files contain references to other members of the Trump administration, including Gary D. Cohn, the chief economic adviser who was associated with 22 Bermuda entities while an executive at Goldman Sachs, and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who was a director of a Bermuda-based joint venture with the government of Yemen when he ran Exxon Mobil\u2019s operations there. There is no evidence of illegality in any of their dealings.Mr. Ross emerges as a particularly valued client for the offshore law firm, whose records provide more insight into his financial holdings beyond the public ethics disclosures he made upon joining the Trump administration. His ethics agreement filed in January listed the partnerships he intended to keep, but not the investments they held. Previously, Navigator had been mentioned in a separate, 57-page description of his holdings for the year that ended in December 2016, but with no hint of its ties to Sibur.In a written response to questions by the Times, James Rockas, a spokesman for Mr. Ross, said that Navigator\u2019s relationship with Sibur began before Mr. Ross joined the board in March 2012, and that he had never met the Russian oligarchs who are Sibur\u2019s major shareholders. Public records show that Mr. Ross\u2019s firm became a major investor in Navigator in November 2011, three months before the company chartered its first ships to Sibur.\u201cSibur was not under sanctions at the time the contract was signed and is still not subject to sanctions,\u201d Mr. Rockas said.More broadly, he said that Mr. Ross \u201crecuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels, but has been generally supportive of the administration\u2019s sanctions of Russian and Venezuelan entities.\u201d\u201cSecretary Ross has never had to seek, nor received, any ethics exemption,\u201d Mr. Rockas said, \u201cand he works closely with Commerce Department ethics officials to ensure the highest ethical standards.\u201dIn the wake of reports of Russian interference in the United States presidential election, multiple investigations have explored potential business ties between Russia and members of the Trump administration. While several Trump campaign and business associates have come under scrutiny, until now no business connections have been reported between senior administration officials and members of Mr. Putin\u2019s family or inner circle.During Mr. Ross\u2019s confirmation process, he was asked repeatedly about his business ties to Russia, mostly related to his former role as vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, where he dealt with Russian investors but also forced some of them out of the bank. He was also asked about his investment in another shipping company, Diamond S, and whether its dealings with China could pose a conflict with his government duties. But he faced no questions about Navigator and its significant financial relationship with Sibur.Mr. Rockas did not respond to questions about the current status of Mr. Ross\u2019s investment. If Mr. Ross stands to benefit, albeit indirectly, from a Russian firm controlled by members of Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle, it poses a potential conflict with his role as the lead cabinet member on trade policy, ethics experts said. Richard W. Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush White House and has emerged as a frequent critic of the Trump administration, said that while Mr. Ross\u2019s continued investment in Navigator would not violate any laws, it created other ethical concerns.\u201cApart from those legal issues,\u201d Mr. Painter said, \u201cI\u2019d be very concerned that someone in the U.S. government was making money from dealing with the Russians.\u201dAs for Navigator, its leadership sees blue skies ahead with one of its key investors now at the helm of American trade policy.On Nov. 30 of last year, hours after being nominated as commerce secretary, Mr. Ross celebrated at Gramercy Tavern, an upscale Manhattan restaurant, at an event hosted by Navigator. He and David J. Butters, Navigator\u2019s chief executive, arrived early to a private room and had a chat.Mr. Ross\u2019s foray into transoceanic shipping took off in 2011, when his private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., assembled teams of investors to acquire major stakes in Diamond S Shipping and Navigator Holdings. Both firms specialized in chartering tankers to petroleum companies that need to move gas, oil and petrochemicals around the world. With Mr. Ross\u2019s involvement, they would expand their business interests in China and Russia.Over a lengthy investment career that included a stint running the bankruptcy advisory practice at the British banking firm Rothschild, he has breathed new life into textile, steel and auto-part businesses. While at Rothschild in the early 1990s, he led a group of bondholders in a restructuring of the floundering Trump casinos in Atlantic City, preserving a stake for Mr. Trump because, as he reportedly assured disgruntled investors, the Trump name was \u201cstill very much an asset.\u201dIn the statement to The Times, Mr. Ross\u2019s spokesman said, \u201cPrivate equity firms have a responsibility to their investors to optimize corporate structures, and Secretary Ross has decades of experience that he is now using to benefit American workers.\u201dAs worldwide shipping concerns, Diamond S and Navigator did not have much of a labor footprint in the United States when Mr. Ross and his investors took over. But the way both companies did business would pose potential conflicts with American interests in other ways.Alongside Mr. Ross, another large investor in Diamond S was a company controlled by the Chinese government, according to securities filings. And Navigator signed a charter agreement with Sibur shortly after Mr. Ross\u2019s firm made its investment. Sibur said in a statement that any negotiations with Navigator over the years were carried out by its executives, not its major shareholders, and that \u201cno meetings were held with Mr. Ross.\u201dInitially, Navigator chartered two vessels to Sibur, and later increased the fleet to four. The relationship proved to be so profitable that Navigator\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Butters, told investors in a 2016 conference call how Navigator benefited as Sibur beat out American competitors in the growing European energy market.\u201cRussia is pipelining as much natural gas as needed into Europe, and liquids are being shipped into all areas of the continent in increasing amounts, all in competition with longer-haul U.S. exports,\u201d Mr. Butters said.As one of the largest gas companies in Russia, Sibur is not just any private business.Then, in September 2014, as sanctions pressure was growing, Mr. Timchenko reduced his holdings in Sibur by selling a 17 percent stake to a junior shareholder, Mr. Shamalov. A year earlier, Mr. Shamalov, whose father is a friend and former business partner of Mr. Putin\u2019s, had married the Russian president\u2019s daughter Katerina. His Sibur purchase, which pushed the 32-year-old Mr. Shamalov\u2019s investment to more than 20 percent of the company, was financed by a $1.3 billion loan from the state-backed Gazprombank. Mr. Shamalov sold part of his stake in April, reducing it to 3.9 percent.Most of these financial machinations were carried out through offshore companies on Cyprus, where Mr. Mikhelson and Mr. Timchenko held their investments in Sibur and did business with several Cypriot banks. During the summer of 2014, Mr. Ross had become the Bank of Cyprus\u2019s vice chairman, though there is no indication that he crossed paths with the two oligarchs during his tenure there.Despite the reluctance of Western financial institutions to do business with Sibur and its owners, Navigator\u2019s relationship with Sibur continued to grow.From 2014 to 2015, the portion of Navigator\u2019s total revenue that came from Sibur jumped to 9.1 percent from 5.3 percent, making the company one of its top five clients, according to securities filings, before dipping to 7.9 percent last year.As WL Ross & Co. expanded over the years, it used Appleby, the offshore specialist, to set up an increasing number of entities in tax havens, many in the Cayman Islands. This British territory in the Caribbean levies no corporate or personal income tax on money earned outside its jurisdiction, and requires little disclosure of corporate ownership. By 2014, Mr. Ross and his investment company were among Appleby\u2019s top 20 clients.His financial disclosure form offered more detail, including a list of assets that had been held by each of the partnerships that he retained. Navigator Holdings appeared in connection with four Appleby-managed Cayman partnerships. Mr. Ross\u2019s ethics filing valued his stake in those partnerships at between $2.05 million and $10.1 million, a fraction of the partnerships\u2019 combined 31.5 percent stake in Navigator, which, based on the firm\u2019s recent stock price, was worth roughly $179 million. In all, WL Ross & Co. remains Navigator\u2019s largest shareholder, according to the shipping company\u2019s most recent annual report.Federal ethics law requires officials to recuse themselves from matters that would have \u201ca direct and predictable\u201d effect on their financial interests or cause a reasonable doubt about their impartiality. During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Ross sought to reassure senators that he would avoid any conflicts of interest between his continued business holdings and his cabinet post.\u201cI intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt,\u201d he said.Sasha Chavkin and Martha M. Hamilton are reporters for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Frederik Obermaier and Bastian Obermayer of S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018They Will Have to Answer to Us\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "FeatureEl Salvador\u2019s gangs try to negotiate a way out of their bloody stalemate with the police. Supported by\u201cWe want to make the government aware that it cannot put an end to the gangs,\u201d the speaker said. \u201cWe are a part of our country\u2019s community.\u201d An attack on the gangs was an attack on the people, and such an attack would have a cost. The F.M.L.N. emerged from the Salvadoran civil war more than two decades earlier, but it was struggling to maintain its claim to be the voice of the people. The gangs are the people, the man in the bandanna concluded, and \u201cwe have the tools to destroy the country\u2019s political establishment.\u201dStanding just off camera was a stocky 33-year-old member of the 18th Street Southerners, known to most of his friends as Santiago. He had written the speech but he couldn\u2019t deliver it, because he was still reeling from a recent gallbladder operation. Santiago had taken an unusual path through the 18th Street hierarchy. As one of six members of a special political commission established by the leadership, he helped maintain the 2012 truce, which cut El Salvador\u2019s homicides nearly in half and awakened in the gangs the sense of political power on display now. In the years since, he remained largely uninvolved in the day-to-day work of gang life \u2014 in El Salvador, mostly shakedowns of small-business owners \u2014 and operated more like a human rights lawyer in a conflict zone. He maintained a log of members killed from every gang, regardless of whether they died at the hands of rivals or, as was increasingly the case, of law enforcement. He ferried victims of police abuse to file complaints with the attorney general\u2019s office on human rights. He lobbied church officials, nongovernmental groups and reporters to speak out against the government\u2019s extraordinary measures. This video was, in a way, the capstone to his efforts. If the government did not care to stop the violence, then the gangs would pursue peace on their own.By August of last year, when I first met Santiago and he told me about his role in the video, he was the last of the original members on the political commission. The rest had been either killed or arrested. The government had repudiated the original truce, treating it as not only an aberration but a criminal conspiracy. The extraordinary measures, which freed the hand of an already brutal police force, also focused to a surprising degree on preventing the gangs from communicating: Prisons housing gang members were placed on lockdown and visits from outsiders were forbidden. The work of organization itself became subversive.When I met him, Santiago sat alone on the second floor of a crowded family restaurant in central San Salvador, sipping a bowl of soup. He wore jeans, work boots and a polo shirt that hid his tattoos. To passers-by, he looked like any other workingman enjoying his lunch.\u201cTell me about terrorism,\u201d Santiago said. He\u2019d heard that I once worked in Afghanistan. \u201cHow do you define it?\u201d El Salvador\u2019s Supreme Court had declared the gangs to be terrorist groups, a move that seemed designed at least in part to draw aid from the United States. For more than an hour, while Santiago smoked cigarettes and drank beer mixed with lemon juice, we talked about terrorism in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Palestine. Santiago granted that the gangs of El Salvador were violent, but theirs was a violence of a different nature. \u201cThe only parallel I see is that we represent a certain community, a segment of society that has been marginalized,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our violence is not ideological and certainly not religious.\u201dI asked him how the gangs represented anyone other than themselves. What services did they provide to the communities? The Taliban governed those under their control with laws that, while brutal, were often more consistently enforced than the government\u2019s. The gangs, by comparison, were predators, killing shopkeepers for failing to pay bribes and battling rival gangs over issues of territory and respect that had nothing to do with the needs of the community.Santiago nodded. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t what services we provide,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is more fundamental: What does our existence say about the government and the services it fails to provide? We exist because there is nothing else.\u201dWhen this original truce finally fell into place in 2012, it almost immediately cut the national homicide rate roughly in half. But as it became public, questions surfaced: Were the gangs merely consolidating their positions before they unleashed another wave of violence? Were the leaders being given special treatment that included access to drugs and prostitutes? Was the government investing in a strategy in which the gangs could negotiate by killing more people? Once exposed, the truce never enjoyed much popularity among Salvadorans, and the United States fiercely opposed it. In 2014, the government began backing away from the effort, and the homicide rate began to climb significantly once again.When S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n became president in June 2014, he cut off all government support for the effort and within seven months had sent the gang leadership back to maximum-security prisons, severing their lines of communication. One of the most peaceful periods since the civil war led to one of the most deadly, and not just because intragang warfare was on the rise. Police violence radically escalated, too, with authorities killing eight times as many suspected gang members in 2015 as they did in 2013. In a remarkable feat of reporting, journalists for the Salvadoran newspaper El Faro found that between January and August 2016, for every police officer that died in a gunfight, 53 suspected gang members were killed. In the history of modern war, combatants are far more likely to be injured than killed. But in El Salvador, during 1,074 firefights with alleged gang members in a 20-month period, the police killed 693 and injured only 255. The country\u2019s vice president has publicly granted officers the right to use deadly force \u201cwithout any fear of suffering consequences.\u201dWhat is happening is like a war in nearly every way, but the vocabulary of war has no words to describe this new variation. The gangs look something like an insurgency, but they appear to have no political aim other than to avoid being killed. The mere existence of would-be diplomats like Santiago reflects a new dynamic, once unthinkable, and at least a potential willingness in some corners to lay down arms. In December 2016, leaders of MS-13 told El Faro that they would be willing to sit down with the government, even placing the dismantling of the gang on the table if it achieved peace. Where before that option was out of the question, the leaders appear to have evolved in the wake of the truce. In February, they created the Gang Coordination Group for Dialogue. The group even reached out this year to a United Nations special envoy, asking him to initiate a dialogue between the gangs and the government.The F.M.L.N. has so far failed to respond to these overtures, and so have many Salvadorans. A recent poll showed that 40 percent of Salvadoran adults approve of torture to combat the gangs, while nearly 35 percent endorse extrajudicial killings. The politicians are unpopular, but so are the gangs. In the neighborhood of Montreal de Mejicanos, a violent hilltop slum under the administration of MS-13, one resident told me that in her area, Finca Argentina, the gangs had killed a boy who refused to join, buried him in an anonymous grave and forbade his parents to retrieve the body. In Aguilares, I attended the funeral of a bus driver killed because his bosses refused to pay two different gangs for the same route. His brother told me the pain and anger were enough to make him want to join their rivals, but he would let the government kill them instead.A gang in El Salvador makes in a year what a Mexican cartel might make in a week. MS-13, the nation\u2019s largest gang, with 40,000 members, takes in about $30 million annually, collecting extortion payments of a few dollars, sometimes in coins, and distributing it in small handouts to its members who also live off whatever food they can strong-arm from local vendors. They seem uninterested in ideology. What power they have derives from their station as the only organized group present in El Salvador\u2019s slums; the only family for Salvador\u2019s tens of thousands of abandoned boys; and, for many, the only economy that exists.His obsession with security was warranted: Marvin, his counterpart from MS-13, had been picked up in the middle of the night in his home. So had Nalo, the political commissioner for the 18th Street Revolutionaries. When we arrived at one of the empty houses one evening, Santiago pulled up in a driveway overgrown with weeds and idled for a minute, observing the scene. The house was dark: a single-story structure with curtains drawn against grated windows. Across the street, someone had installed a public-address system and hung a sign to transform a similar home into a church. The voices of evangelicals praising God drifted across the otherwise silent street. Satisfied that no one was outside, Santiago unchained the garage, threw open its rusted doors and drove inside.The house looked only slightly better on the inside. The matted fabric of the living-room furniture was covered in cigarette burns. Spider webs filled the hallways. Santiago turned the water off the last time he left, and the toilets would not flush. He decided to wait for the service across the street to end before going outside to switch it back on. \u201cI prefer if people don\u2019t see me here,\u201d he said.Someone had mounted a new flat-screen TV to the cinder block wall. Santiago dropped onto the sofa and turned on the local news. He liked to keep track of political developments elsewhere in Latin America, he said.As he flipped through channels, his cellphone rang. He answered, then listened quietly for a moment. \u201cDo you want to file a complaint?\u201d he asked finally. \u201cI or someone else from the team can take you to the human rights office tomorrow, to fill out the paperwork.\u201d He listened again, said he understood and hung up with a sigh.It was the wife of one of the leaders, he said. Her husband had been imprisoned for years, and she hadn\u2019t been allowed to talk to him in the months since the extraordinary measures went into effect. She said the police still harassed her, stopping by her home, breaking furniture, stealing valuables. She had thought about filing a complaint, but there were rumors that the prisons might begin allowing family visits again. If she filed a complaint, the police might not let her see her husband. In the end, she decided to drop it altogether.Santiago liked his work, but it was growing harder. Most of his friends were dead or in jail, he said. A few made it to the United States and lived quiet lives with wives and kids. He sometimes thought he should follow them, but he feared discovery by American authorities. \u201cI\u2019m the last of my group that remains,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever happens, it won\u2019t be good.\u201dSantiago joined the 18th Street gang in 1998, at 15. His father, who had been a police officer, had left his family behind, making his way to the United States when Santiago was too young to remember, and Santiago as a young man had little ambition beyond, perhaps, moving his own life in a different direction. During the early years as an 18th Street member, he spent his days working in an upholstery shop while finishing his high-school degree at night. He supported his mother with money from odd jobs, but wanted something more. He liked being part of a community, he said, but otherwise it \u201chad no purpose, it was just for the sake of it, just to be living the thug life.\u201dSlowly, the gangs began to formalize, issuing codes of conduct that prohibited attacks on fellow members and the use of hard drugs like crack. Santiago himself was a part of this evolution. Just before he graduated from high school, a founder of the 18th Street gang, Carlos Mojica, known as El Viejo Lin, invited him to a meal. Lin had turned his sights on developing 18th Street into something that more closely resembled organized crime. Santiago went to the meeting straight from school and was still wearing his uniform when they sat down. Lin smiled. \u201cContinue studying as much as you can,\u201d Santiago recalls him saying. \u201cPeople like us need to find an interest, something to occupy our minds.\u201d He gave Santiago a reading list that included the Salvadoran constitution and the Bible. \u201cHe told me that I should go to church,\u201d Santiago recalled. \u201cI thought he was crazy, but then he told me: \u2018I\u2019m not saying you should become a Christian, but trust me, you won\u2019t find peace anywhere else.\u2019\u2009\u201d Santiago took his advice seriously, memorizing passages from the Bible and beginning to organize evangelical events. His was an odd gospel, one that combined Christian principles like unity and love with an acceptance of the violence and crime by which the gangs defined themselves.That all changed in 2006, when Santiago was charged with attempted murder following a shootout with MS-13, even though he claims he played no part in it. After the government dropped the charges for lack of evidence, Santiago says, he decided that it was time to put an end to the criminal chapter of his life. He asked the leadership if he could focus his energies on finding channels for peace. They agreed.Santiago never shared with me how, or what, he was paid for his work, but it couldn\u2019t have been much. His daughter was supported by remittances from her mother\u2019s relatives in the United States. The only lucrative stream of income they could have tapped, from the cartels that passed through their territory, was off-limits. I asked Santiago why the gangs, with all their manpower, never tried to tax the cartels. He laughed. \u201cNo way, man,\u201d he said. With the government war on them, the gangs could hardly afford a fight with the cartels. \u201cI have read a little about Hitler,\u201d Santiago said. \u201cHe was caught out because he opened too many fronts.\u201dSantiago is a fast and energetic talker, and when he gets going \u2014 bouncing from China\u2019s Communist government to Colombia\u2019s peace process to Russia under Putin \u2014 he engages his arms and torso like a conductor, as if summoning his own best ideas. He once told me that in another life, he would have studied law, a profession more suited to his intellectual curiosity. But he also told me that he didn\u2019t regret joining a gang, only that he hadn\u2019t started his reform efforts sooner. Gang structures are cellular, and on a neighborhood level, they often operate independently of the broader leadership. Santiago knew most everyone, and he spent his days on the phone with his rivals and sometimes met them in person. They shared details of the latest death by the hand of a rival or the police. They discussed coming meetings with church or nongovernmental leaders. They planned joint communiqu\u00e9s and kept open the lines of communication to avoid any setbacks in the cease-fire.He pondered whether he would have joined the gang if he had grown up under different circumstances. While many gang members blame the government for breaking the first truce, for Santiago the failure was simpler than that. The truce improved the lives of gang members, who were dying in fewer numbers, and of the government, which could take credit for the lower homicide stats. But average Salvadorans didn\u2019t see much improvement in their lives. Extortion continued, as did the murder of innocents. Santiago said that continuing to demand money from civilians had been the central mistake of the truce; why it had been destined to fail.\u201cIt\u2019s really sad to reach this conclusion,\u201d he told me earlier. \u201cWe understood this maybe 24 months after the truce began, but it was too late. We should\u2019ve started there.\u201dI asked Santiago if he would ever allow his son to join a gang. \u201cMy son is the most outgoing kid you\u2019ll ever meet,\u201d he said, allowing himself a smile. \u201cHe shakes your hand, asks your name and wants to tell you all about his school. If he wanted to join a gang, it would be more than 10 years from now. By that time, I hope this dynamic of violence will have changed; if not, no one will want anything to do with it.\u201dThe captain and a driver picked up three young officers from the sidewalk of the central square: well-groomed, well-built 27-year-old graduates of the same class at the police academy. We eased out of the dense streets of central Soyapango toward a neighborhood called Horizontes, in the thick of MS-13 territory. Even in the generally dilapidated state of San Salvador, there was a noticeable increase in the general disrepair. The streets were crushed into rubble, empty lots were overgrown and abandoned, most of the houses were made of cinder block, without so much as a coat of paint or plaster. Trash filled the open spaces like wild grass.The plan, such as it was, involved searching a nearby \u201cdestroyer house,\u201d slang for a hide-out, this one in Horizontes, where they believed some MS-13 members might be seeking refuge after a firefight with the police. In reality, the mission was simpler than that: a \u201cpresence patrol,\u201d to show they could come and go as they wished in enemy territory, a reminder to the gangs, or anyone who helped them, that the government would not sit idle. One officer told me that he and his fellow officers had killed five gang members in a firefight two weeks earlier, in the exact spot where we walked. He pointed to a sewage pipe emerging from a storm drain. \u201cOne of them died there,\u201d he said, adjusting his assault rifle. The survivors had run, he said, but the police had come to believe that the gang members were hiding in the destroyer house.Stripped of paint, its windows sealed with boards, the home looked abandoned. An officer nicknamed Chino, because his fellow officers thought his light skin and almond eyes made him look Chinese, banged on the door. When no one responded, he knocked out the front window board. To our surprise, a young man wearing only boxers stepped into the living room, his hands raised. Chino leapt through the window cavity and took aim at him. \u201cGet down,\u201d he yelled. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dThe young man dropped to his knees. \u201cI live here,\u201d he replied, looking up slightly.\u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d the cop responded. \u201cYou\u2019re hiding out.\u201dA foam mattress with a soiled, twisted sheet lay in the center of the room. A badly torn sofa, its coils exposed through faded velvet, was pressed against a wall. Chino asked the man how long he\u2019d been in the gang. \u201cI\u2019m not involved in anything,\u201d he replied. \u201cI sell tomatoes in the central market. I live with my girlfriend here. She\u2019s pregnant with our second kid.\u201dChino told him to lie flat and then placed the tip of his boot beneath the young man\u2019s chin and lightly lifted his face, now looking him directly in the eye. \u201cI don\u2019t believe your wife lives here,\u201d he said. \u201cLike this.\u201dAnother officer came in from the backyard; he was clutching a police belt with the holster attached. \u201cDid you take this from a police officer?\u201d Chino demanded, tossing the belt on the mattress pad.The boy began to plead. \u201cNo way, you guys would kill me,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cImagine me doing something like that, with two kids.\u201d The cops stepped outside to call in the apparent theft of the belt. From the other end, they received orders to leave the boy alone. Because he was 17 and thus underage, he was not worth the trouble.We walked to Valle de las Delicias, a neighborhood a few blocks over. Giant blue-and-black murals covered the backs of buildings, memorials to fallen leaders that, despite the surrounding decay, were remarkably well maintained. As we snaked through an alley, we came upon another young man, slender with curly hair and acne scars covering his face, who was talking to someone on a candy-bar-style cellphone that hailed from the 1990s. An officer snatched the phone away, tossed it to a colleague and began to frisk the man roughly.\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said, resisting the manhandling. The boy\u2019s parents raced onto their porch.\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything, why are you harassing him?\u201d the father, who was smaller than his son and wore a yellowed tank top, demanded. The officer pressed down on the boy\u2019s neck until he was nearly bent over. He asked his colleagues for a camera to register him. \u201cHe\u2019s got no record of any crimes, why are you placing him in the system?\u201d the father asked.\u201cShut up or I\u2019ll register you next,\u201d the officer snapped.The cops left the family seething on their porch. \u201cLook at how they abuse him, just because he is young,\u201d the father told me. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how they can live with themselves. They have kids, too. How would they like it if someone did this to their kids?\u201dAt the end of the patrol, we walked to the edge of the neighborhood, marked by a giant ceiba tree that soared some 150 feet above a parking lot at the edge of a fallow field. The officer who had registered the boy asked me what the family had said to me. I told him. He paused to reflect.\u201cIn these marginalized communities, every family has at least one person involved with the gangs,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course I\u2019m sad about this. I\u2019m sad about the poverty, I feel sorry for these families, those involved in the gangs, but especially the innocents who die.\u201d A police truck idled beneath the tree\u2019s broad canopy. The officers got in, one by one.\u201cAll of this is about poverty and marginalization,\u201d he said, nodding at a trash bin near the tree\u2019s sprawling roots, where the words \u201c[Expletive] Police\u201d were written in English.With the pressure brought by the extraordinary measures, the meetings had all but ceased. Santiago still tried to communicate with the members of the group, and occasionally, he would visit one. And so, on a Saturday afternoon in October, he drove to the Lutheran church offices to catch up with the bishop, Medardo G\u00f3mez.\u201cMay I help you, sir?\u201d the receptionist asked, eyeing Santiago as he loitered in front of her desk.\u201cI\u2019m here to see the bishop,\u201d Santiago said with a broad smile.\u201cHe\u2019s in the middle of a meeting right now,\u201d she said, staring at her computer.Santiago took a seat and waited. It was nearly noon, and a small crowd sat outside the bishop\u2019s office. Most were dressed in formal attire. Santiago wore a collared shirt, jeans and a pair of Nike running shoes that a friend had given him. After a few minutes, an older woman with a pressed suit and fine jewelry walked into the lobby. She stopped when she saw Santiago in the waiting room.\u201cOh, my God, it\u2019s you,\u201d she said, racing toward him and giving him a hug. \u201cDoes he know you\u2019re here?\u201d she asked, nodding toward the bishop\u2019s door. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen you in months,\u201d she continued excitedly. \u201cHow are things? We heard about Alex,\u201d she said, referring to a member of the political committee from the 18th Street Revolutionaries who had been arrested. \u201cThis situation is just horrible right now. You\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve seen in months.\u201dShe ushered him to the bishop\u2019s door and presented him. The bishop, an elderly man with rheumy eyes, sat at the head of a modest conference table, hosting a small gathering. The crowd dissipated when Santiago entered, and the bishop stood to greet him. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you here, I wasn\u2019t sure if you had been grabbed, too,\u201d he said, placing his mottled hand on top of Santiago\u2019s. \u201cI told Alex he needed to make routine changes. But they caught him at home, at dawn.\u201d\u201cThank God they didn\u2019t do anything else to him,\u201d Santiago said.Like Santiago, Alex was a part of the political committee from the beginning, ever since the truce was first announced. Now he was locked up for murder, the bishop said.\u201cI\u2019ve been told that there are testimonies saying it wasn\u2019t him,\u201d the bishop continued, staring at the table as if talking to no one in particular, \u201cMaybe they will prove it.\u201d He turned to face Santiago, who was looking at the vast collection of photos on the bishop\u2019s desk and walls. \u201cIt seems that you are the only survivor.\u201dMarvin, Santiago\u2019s counterpart within MS-13, was in prison and suspected to be cooperating with the authorities under a plea agreement. Nalo, a top leader of the 18th Street Revolutionaries, whose real name is Carlos Eduardo Burgos Nuila, was too. Alex, meanwhile, was imprisoned but, so far as anyone knew, had signed no such deal. Though the gangs had moved swiftly to replace them and resume communications with the rest of the committee, the bonds were new and untested.Santiago asked the bishop how things had been going with the other members of the informal group \u2014 the diplomats, nongovernmental workers and church leaders. The receptionist entered with the bishop\u2019s lunch, a watery bowl of stew. The bishop looked down at it with disappointment.The bishop said he was planning a forum to bring together local leaders and government officials to talk about the extraordinary measures, specifically the impact the violence was having in neighborhoods. He lifted the bowl to his lips and drank, then picked at a tough-looking piece of short rib before giving up. \u201cWe must insist on dialogue and push forward at all levels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to see it only as a dialogue with gangs, but we want to integrate, boost dialogue, with everyone.\u201dThe bishop held a faint hope that by bringing residents of the affected areas out to speak with officials, they would hear stories about the misery their policy had wrought. \u201cThe measures have made matters worse instead of being helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea of a forum is to say, both nationally and internationally, \u2018Look, the extraordinary measures here are not working.\u2019\u2009\u201d He paused and sighed. \u201cWe can\u2019t deny the death toll has decreased,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut the way the police are behaving now, they have stopped being agents of safety. Now they are agents of death.\u201dSantiago grew animated. To hear a respected church leader echo his feelings had brought him to something like catharsis. These days, he said, the police staged fake gunfights just to kill gang members, then explained it away by calling them terrorists. \u201cDo I look like a terrorist?\u201d he asked the bishop.The bishop shook his head and pushed his chair back from the table. There were heavy bags under his eyes, and he was running late for a meeting in another part of town. He looked at Santiago. \u201cNo, it\u2019s clear to me that they have just said this to justify repression and request international assistance,\u201d he said.Santiago saw the bishop off, then lit a cigarette in the building\u2019s courtyard, beside a dormant fountain overrun with foliage. \u201cThese chats give me strength; they tell me that I\u2019m not alone,\u201d he said, flicking his ash into an empty bucket. \u201cThat at least someone thinks like I do.\u201dThough Santiago felt sorry for his former compatriots, he mostly felt devastated that years of work \u2014 building alliances and trust in civil society, forging relationships with rivals, selling the vision on the streets \u2014 had been turned into a public spectacle. But he had his own problems to worry about. By the end of August, even before the defendants were found not guilty, he was already preparing to flee the country.Santiago knew there would be no reprieve, at least not until the 2018 elections. Well before the trial, Santiago wrote a manifesto for the gangs. For the first time in decades, they would not support the F.M.L.N. at the polls. They would instead use their political might to swing the elections away from them, whether to the right-wing party or, potentially, third-party candidates. The quid pro quo had always been support \u2014 in return for money \u2014 for the F.M.L.N. But President S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n of the F.M.L.N. had broken its longstanding relationship with the gangs by waging war against them. So the gangs would respond by wielding their 10 percent of the vote to punish them in the Legislature. The approaches from political parties had already started: politicians seeking access, favors, votes ahead of next year\u2019s election. \u201cWe are the pretty girl that everyone wants to dance with right now,\u201d Santiago told me.But they would do so without Santiago. The authorities had found him. This February, months before the trial started, he was pulled over for a routine traffic stop after another meeting with Bishop G\u00f3mez. The police ran his car and identification, then let him go. But Santiago was suspicious. He sent his car to a specialist who found a GPS tracking device stuck to the chassis. Santiago switched vehicles.In April, shortly after Easter, the police stopped him again. This time they charged him with resisting arrest and placed him in detention. After four days, two prosecutors and a police investigator came with an offer. The truce trial was a few months away and Santiago could testify against his former compatriots or he could go to jail for the rest of his life, on possible charges of gun trafficking, electoral fraud and smuggling contraband into jails. After making the offer, the authorities were forced to let him go \u2014 they had no grounds to hold him.But he knew they would arrest him again, and he would be faced with the same dilemma. He didn\u2019t want to snitch and undermine what he genuinely believed was the only way out of the cycle of violence consuming El Salvador. It would be turning his back on everything he\u2019d worked for and all those he had tried to convince. At the same time, with the prisons teeming with disease and overpopulation, he couldn\u2019t imagine being consigned to a shared cell for the rest of his life. He was only 34. He decided to flee.When we last spoke, he would not tell me where he was, only that he had no plans to return to El Salvador, at least not for the next year or so. He was no longer the optimist of even six months earlier. The F.M.L.N. would lose the presidential election in 2019. And his people, the gangs and their community, would ensure they had a tough time in next year\u2019s legislative and municipal elections. But in the meantime, he could do nothing to further the cause of dialogue. For now, that effort was broken.\u201cRight now, I\u2019m a bit more of a realist,\u201d he said. \u201cI could argue that no matter which party wins, they are not going to look for an alternative.\u201d The civil war took years and tens of thousands of deaths to push both sides to negotiate. So, too, would this war. Wars only end when someone wins or when both sides grow tired of the killing. \u201cThe violence has to reach a much higher level than where it is now to force that reckoning,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly then will people start thinking about an integrated solution. The truth is, the country has to bleed more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Alaska Senator Wants to Fight Climate Change and Drill for Oil, Too", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Lisa Murkowski was unequivocal when asked recently about rising global temperatures: \u201cClimate change is real,\u201d the Alaska Republican told an audience in Anchorage.Her views \u2014 contradictory to some, a pragmatic balance for others \u2014 will take center stage on Thursday when the committee holds a hearing on opening part of the refuge to drilling, an effort to raise revenue for the federal government as part of a planned tax overhaul.For supporters of drilling in the Arctic refuge, the tax plan represents the best chance in decades to realize the dream of drilling for oil beneath the tundra.The debate\u2019s importance, though, may ultimately go well beyond the fate of the Arctic refuge. Analysts say Senator Murkowski\u2019s stance symbolizes a fundamental challenge of climate politics: how to bridge the gap between moderate Republicans from states reliant on fossil fuels on one side and Democrats and environmental activists on the other.\u201cIt\u2019s not unfair for environmentalists to argue that if you take climate change seriously, it simply requires the rapid decarbonization of the economy. Full stop. Climate change is real and demands a policy response,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. Of Senator Murkowski, he added: \u201cHer skepticism is about that policy response. Anything that\u2019s going to increase oil and gas prices is something she\u2019s going to be very skeptical about.\u201dThe senator said she sees no inconsistencies in her views.\u201cI think for anybody who has spent any time in Alaska, there is an awareness that we all have that we are seeing the impacts of climate change perhaps more readily than in other parts of the country because of our Arctic environment,\u201d Senator Murkowski said in an interview.\u201cBut we\u2019re also a place where we recognize that in order to stay warm, we have to have a resource that can keep us warm, and oil has been a mainstay for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve provided it to the country and that has allowed for jobs and revenues, it has allowed for schools and roads and institutions that everybody else around the country enjoys.\u201dThe loss of frozen ground in Arctic regions is a striking result of climate change. And it is also a cause of more warming to come.Champions of opening the refuge assert that shifting Alaska\u2019s economy will take time, and, despite gains in renewable power, the reality is that oil will be around for decades to come.The budget blueprint also paves the way for a drilling measure to be attached to the tax overhaul. Using that approach, Republicans would be able to open the refuge to drilling without encountering a filibuster.The Trump administration has cited possible revenues to federal coffers totaling $1.8 billion by 2018. Senator Murkowski\u2019s energy panel, where Republicans hold a majority, could vote as early as next week to approve legislation directing part of the refuge opened.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.\u201cAlaska\u2019s outdoor and tourism economy already generates more jobs than the oil economy,\u201d Senator Cantwell said. \u201cPersonally, I would be working to protect that outdoor wildlife economy instead of undermining it by drilling in the Arctic.\u201d\u201cIf we were to immediately shut down production activity that is occurring, even if we went to zero, it is not going to make a difference in stopping any kind of change in our climate,\u201d she said.It\u2019s a case that Senator Murkowski makes as well. The answer, she argues, lies in using oil revenues to pave the way for alternative energy sources.\u201cIt\u2019s not something that can be done overnight, and it is something that can only be done if you have resources,\u201d she said. Alaska, Senator Murkowski said, embraces clean energy and has devoted state resources to boosting capital for distributed energy and developing microgrids to power remote parts of the country.\u201cFor the people who live and work and raise their families in a very small population state, we don\u2019t think we are the problem,\u201d Senator Murkowski said. \u201cWe think we are the answer.\u201dThomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

And many of the company\u2019s business documents are stored in cloud-based data centers.But the costs of doing business on the internet may be about to rise.Without those regulations, GoodLight and other smaller businesses fear they may not have a level digital playing field to compete against deep-pocketed industry giants that could pay to get an edge online.\u201cFor such an analog product, we\u2019re heavily reliant on the digital world and the internet for our day-to-day operations,\u201d said Mr. Callicott, who helped found the company nearly eight years ago and now works with three other full-time employees. \u201cThe internet, the speed of it, our entire business revolves around that.\u201dInternet service providers say that the proposal would lead to a better variety of services for online customers and more innovation in the industry.For small businesses, a rollback could fundamentally change how, and whether, they do business. Many started online or turned to e-commerce to expand their thin margins.\u201cThings are already difficult enough as it is for a small businesses,\u201d Mr. Callicott said. \u201cYou\u2019re busy enough just keeping your company running, trying to grow and succeed or just stay alive, that you don\u2019t have the resources or the time to contemplate how to prepare for something like this.\u201d\u201cThe open internet has made it possible for us to rely on a free market where each of us has the chance to bring our best business ideas to the world without interference or seeking permission from any gatekeeper first,\u201d the groups wrote.Many entrepreneurs worried that, without net neutrality provisions, internet providers would wield their increased power to control how businesses reach consumers.Critics of the F.C.C. proposal say internet service providers could manipulate traffic speeds to establish a \u201cfast lane\u201d of sorts or cap or block access to certain sites, charging fees to lift the restrictions. Small enterprises would struggle to pay, leaving them at a commercial disadvantage, they said.Independent contractors like Clayton Cowles, who works in upstate New York, could also be vulnerable.Mr. Cowles draws the text for comic book publishers including Marvel, DC and Image, and has worked on Batman, Star Wars and other popular series.Each month, he pays Spectrum, his internet service provider, $90.70 for the company\u2019s most powerful service package, which is supposed to allow him to send enormous digital documents within seconds. Instead, his files sometimes take 15 minutes to be delivered, he said.A more deeply deregulated Spectrum is one of his \u201cgreatest fears,\u201d he said.\u201cThey pretty much have a monopoly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m stuck with them.\u201dA pay-for-play internet system could also be problematic for Codecademy, an education company founded in 2011. Its services include courses on tech-related subjects like data analysis, website design and coding language \u2014 all conducted online.But Zach Sims, the company\u2019s chief executive, said that students, many of whom are aspiring entrepreneurs, would suffer most.\u201cThey\u2019ll perceive it as an unfair playing field,\u201d he said. \u201cAs every industry is upended by tech, the barrier to entry is knowing what technology is and how to implement it, but this adds another level of confusion, making the hurdle even higher for normal businesses to participate.\u201dFollow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsuNiraj Chokshi contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

But once you have read the story, there is only one decent response: Moore, the Republican nominee to become Alabama\u2019s next senator, needs to quit the race immediately.The \u201cif true\u201d response wrongly suggests that there will be some final reckoning of facts to remove any doubt about what Moore did. But there won\u2019t be. He will likely continue denying the allegations, and people will have to choose between The Post\u2019s reams of evidence and Moore\u2019s lack of it.\u201cThe allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying. He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of.\u201dObviously not. And that appears to be the choice senators will have, based on yesterday\u2019s early news about the Senate bill.Republican Senate leaders seem to be putting together a bill designed to give huge tax cuts to the wealthy and little to the middle class. The bill would also create large budget deficits that middle-class families would ultimately have to help pay off.The Senate will probably take away a few damaging provisions from the House bill, like a higher tax rate for low-income households. But the bill still seems geared overwhelmingly to the wealthy. One centerpiece is a reduction of the estate tax, which falls on only a sliver of rich families. Another provision makes the House bill worse: a lower income tax rate for the highest earners.It is still possible for the Senate to write a bill that actually tries to clean up the tax code and make life easier on the middle class and poor. But the Senate is now a long way from doing so.I\u2019m encouraged to see several Republican senators raising concerns. Bob Corker and Jeff Flake are worried about soaring deficits. Mike Lee and Marco Rubio want a larger child tax credit. There are also multiple differences between the Senate and House bills that could be difficult to square. Any three Republicans can likely keep a damaging bill from passing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: A Quest to Define \u2018Upstate\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this unseasonably warm Wednesday.At what point along the 300-mile journey from New York City to the Canadian border would you consider yourself \u201cupstate\u201d?Ask three New Yorkers, and you\u2019re bound to get four different answers.Some say upstate begins where Metro-North ends; a few cheeky Lower Manhattanites have told us it\u2019s anywhere north of 14th Street.We recently set off in search of a proper definition, and began by reaching out to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s office.A diplomatic answer, but an unhelpful one.We turned to The Associated Press Stylebook, the arbiter of journalistic disputes, which advised that the term generally refers to anywhere in the state north of Westchester County. (The Times\u2019s own stylebook doesn\u2019t dare take on the topic.)The results showed divisions that seem insurmountable: 25 percent said everything north of New York City; 29 percent said everything north of Westchester County; 22 percent said everything north of Poughkeepsie; 7 percent said everything north of Poughkeepsie, excluding the Buffalo area; 9 percent gave other answers; and 7 percent said they weren\u2019t sure.Throughout New York\u2019s political history, Mr. Molinaro said, downstate and upstate have generally been used to describe the political, cultural and demographic differences between two areas: \u201cNew York City and not New York City.\u201dBut the line has blurred over time.\u201cAs New York City residents moved further outside of the city, and still maintained a relationship with the city, the line of upstate has moved further and further north,\u201d he said. He added that over the last 10 years the upstate-downstate line had moved to Poughkeepsie from Beacon, and in another decade he expects it to be north of Dutchess County.\u201cI\u2019m at peace with it that there is no right or wrong answer,\u201d he told us. \u201cUpstate is where you feel it is in your heart.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:We\u2019re confused, but not complaining.It\u2019s not going to last, though. Temperatures are forecast to drop tomorrow.Forget the politicians and the polls: Who knows more about New York than New York Today\u2019s readers?We recently asked for your definitions of where upstate begins. Here are some of the responses:\u201cA working definition of where upstate begins: Where people stop saying \u2018my bodega\u2019 and start saying \u2018my Wegmans.\u2019\u201d\u2014 Alan Oberst, 40, Lower Manhattan\u201cWhen I went to college I was offended when my friends from Long Island and the city referred to northern Westchester as upstate. Then when I moved to the city, and now lower Westchester, I refer to anything north of me as upstate. Sorry, not sorry.\u201d\u2014 Paul Persichette, 32, Bronxville, N.Y.\u201cUpstate definitely starts when people say all their tax money goes to support New York City.\u201d\u201cUpstate for me is that moment I travel beyond exit 15 on the Thruway, feel a sudden sense of relaxation come over me, and take in the ever-increasing beauty as I continue north, wherever my journey may take me.\u201d\u2014 Lori Rocker, 52, Basking Ridge, N.J.\u201cI live in Inwood. It is the last stop north on the A train. I have heard my neighborhood referred to as \u2018upstate Manhattan.\u2019\u201d\u2014 Susan Newell, 68, Inwood\u201cBattery Park is upstate to me. I\u2019ve lived on Staten Island my whole life \u2014 it\u2019s that little dot of land that lies directly below the entire state of New York.\u201d\u2014 Susan Amesse, 59, Staten IslandWhere do you think upstate New York begins? Let us know in the comments.Advertisement"}

This tax bill would take money from working families and give it to the world\u2019s wealthiest people.The hardest hit would be in high-cost states like California, New Jersey and New York because the bill gets rid of important deductions and the credit for state and local taxes.The opposition of Mr. Johnson, Ms. Collins and others has raised hopes that a handful of Republican senators can be persuaded to torpedo this tax-cut bill in the same way that three of them sent the effort to repeal the A.C.A. down to defeat a few months ago.It still boggles the mind that any lawmaker could support a proposal that would do so much damage to working people and the fiscal health of the government.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Mr. Robot\u2019 Season 3, Episode 4: Elliot Under Fire", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. RobotIt\u2019s never been easy being Elliot, what with the shattered family and history of depression, anxiety and addiction, not to mention the caustic alter ego battling him for control of his own mind and body.But in this third season of \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d Elliot\u2019s persecution has reached a new intensity. Because as we saw in Wednesday\u2019s busy setup for the long-promised Stage 2 \u2014 or its undoing \u2014 now that the secret about Elliot\u2019s dual nature is all the way out, pretty much everyone in this story is using his Hyde against him.Angela and the rest of Team Whiterose are riding Mr. Robot\u2019s rage and capabilities toward Stage 2 as well as perhaps some reality manipulating cyber-feat to be named later. Wellick, Elliot\u2019s erstwhile adorer, now has absolutely no use for \u201cthis [expletive]\u201d and has declared their partnership over. (Last week we wondered how he would handle dealing with Elliot\u2019s duality, and we now have our answer: Not well!)Darlene is using Mr. Robot as a patsy for her own self-preservation, wielding his recent abuses \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not gonna let you hurt me again\u201d \u2014 as a cudgel against Elliot. It had the desired effect, stopping his inquisition into her actions and obfuscating, for another week at least, the fact that she\u2019s betraying her brother. (Which, right, that\u2019s another thing that stinks for Elliot.)As for Elliot himself: He\u2019s accepted that Mr. Robot is definitely still around and plotting to blow up E Corp\u2019s records building, but he\u2019s still playing the chess game, trying to thwart Stage 2 himself rather than tip off the F.B.I. The reason is he needs \u201cto see where this leads,\u201d he tells Darlene, and also seems related to his previously stated desire to be part of something more significant than office parties and his co-worker\u2019s overshares.Many of this year\u2019s best TV shows and movies are available to stream right now. Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site, can show you where. Tell us what mood you\u2019re in or what services you subscribe to and we\u2019ll help you out.\u201cThere\u2019s something inside me that can\u2019t let go of what we started,\u201d Elliot says.In other words there are signs that Elliot, too, may be subconsciously using Mr. Robot in a way that is harmful to himself along with however many people work in the E Corp facility his alter ego hopes to blow up. \u201cNow he\u2019s trying to wage a terrorist attack and that excites me,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cWhy?\u201dPerhaps answers will arrive Sept. 29. That\u2019s when Stage 2 is set to go down, per Irving\u2019s instructions to Angela over breakfast ribs. With Elliot\u2019s shipping counter-maneuvers and new tendency to randomly \u201cshow up\u201d threatening the plan, Irving has either handed the keys to Wellick or set him up to take the fall. (Perhaps both.) We talked last week about Irving\u2019s manipulative skill and here he reeled in Wellick like a rageful Swedish fish, using the man\u2019s destiny-and-gods rhetoric against him. \u201cThis is the moment you were born for,\u201d he says.I want my family sent to Ukraine, Wellick says. Tell my wife about the plan.\u201cOf course,\u201d Irving replies softly, Bobby Cannavale managing to convey both pity and pragmatism in one pregnant pause. (Remember Agent Santiago is one of the few people who knows Joanna is dead, which means that Irving does, too.)Darlene blamed her hacking of Elliot\u2019s computer on the fact that Mr. Robot was not to be trusted, a cagey diversion that also happens to be true. Soon they were walking Flipper and planning a sibling project, which in the Alderson clan means one of you staking out the other in case his sinister alter ego sneaks off to smash the world\u2019s economy. (\u201cIt\u2019s weird but I guess we passed weird a long time ago,\u201d Darlene notes.) The gambit reveals that Angela is in league with Mr. Robot.The episode opened with her confessing her sins to a subway pickpocket, requesting the return of only a Polaroid of the Aldersons in happier times. \u201cMetadata is story behind the data,\u201d Elliot tells us later. When people post pictures to on social media, they don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve handed over a wealth of private information \u201call hidden inside the photograph\u2019s metadata,\u201d he said.So what story is hidden within Darlene\u2019s analog photo, or at least in its surpassing meaningfulness to her? That the only thing that Darlene cares about is her memory of a time when her family was intact, at least, and perhaps even happy. A time before her father\u2019s death or Elliot\u2019s mental break, before cellphone photos or cataclysmic hacks.Perhaps it\u2019s that while she\u2019s telling Dom that her cooperation with the F.B.I. means that \u201cI\u2019m gonna lose my brother,\u201d when the time comes to effectively sever that tie, she won\u2019t be able to go through with it.\u2022 Angela confirmed that she got Elliot the E Corp job because \u201cit was the best way to manage him.\u201d We all saw how that worked out, so now she\u2019s having him banned from the building. I know this random employee doesn\u2019t matter to you, she told Pryce, but while Angela may believe think that, it\u2019s not really true, is it? Pryce told Whiterose he knows who was behind the 5/9 hack back in Season 1.\u2022 By the way how is Elliot not collapsing, working with Wellick every night and at E Corp during the day? Or Angela either, for that matter? Probably best not to ponder this aspect too deeply.\u2022 So what\u2019s in Angela\u2019s hypodermic, anyway? One shot and Dr. Jekyll reverts to Hyde.\u2022 What was your read on the fsociety wannabe taken in by the F.B.I.? A Dark Army patsy offered up to distract law enforcement from Stage 2? Or a sign that the movement is still out there, inspiring Fruity Pebbles-munching malcontents?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen Will Leave Federal Reserve Next Year", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said on Monday that she would step down from the Fed\u2019s board at the same time that she ends her term as chairwoman.President Trump decided earlier this month to nominate Jerome H. Powell, a Republican who sits on the Fed\u2019s board, as the next chairman, deciding against offering Ms. Yellen a second term. Ms. Yellen, whose term as chairwoman ends in February, could have remained on the Fed board until her term as governor expires in 2024.Her decision to step down instead had been widely expected, though some Democrats had argued publicly and privately that she could best defend her legacy from the inside.Ms. Yellen also praised the selection of Mr. Powell as her replacement, and promised to work toward a smooth transition.Ms. Yellen\u2019s departure would leave the Fed with just three people on its seven-member board, which would be the fewest in the Fed\u2019s history and could strain the board\u2019s ability to manage the operations of the central bank. The dearth of governors also means that a majority of the votes on the Fed\u2019s Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, are now held by the presidents of regional reserve banks, not political appointees. The committee consists of 12 voting members \u2014 the seven Fed governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and four additional Reserve Bank presidents.Ms. Yellen, 71, has spent almost two decades at the Fed. President Bill Clinton named her as a governor in the mid-1990s. She returned to teach at the University of California, Berkeley, before going back to the Fed as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2004. She became vice chairwoman in 2010.As vice chairwoman, she worked closely with the then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke on the Fed\u2019s post-crisis stimulus campaign. She paid tribute to Mr. Bernanke in her resignation letter, writing that his \u201cleadership during the financial crisis and its aftermath was critical to restoring the soundness of our financial system and the prosperity of our economy.\u201dAfter succeeding Mr. Bernanke in 2014, Ms. Yellen continued those efforts.Among her most important achievements was convincing Fed officials to be patient and to repeatedly extend the stimulus campaign. She rallied her colleagues to the view that the economy had plenty of room to expand without driving up inflation. The Fed continued to hold down interest rates, and job growth continued at a pace many had regarded as unsustainable.The unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent in October while inflation has remained sluggish. The Fed has rarely come closer to its goals of maximizing employment and stabilizing inflation.Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth economist who worked as an adviser to Ms. Yellen, credited her with \u201cleading and managing a relatively large Fed committee with lots of independent voices.\u201d\u201cSometimes they call it a cacophony,\u201d he said. \u201cShe managed to turn it into a symphony.\u201d\u201cWhat also counted were her common sense and her open mind,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cThat has made a material difference in people\u2019s lives and livelihoods.\u201dMs. Yellen\u2019s focus on unemployment represented a shift for the Fed, which in the decades before the 2008 financial crisis honed a single-minded emphasis on controlling inflation.She paid regular visits to job-training programs across the country, meeting with groups of workers to hear their stories. She also invited a coalition of unions and community groups, Fed Up, to meet with her in the Fed\u2019s grand boardroom on the National Mall in Washington.\u201cIt is my hope,\u201d she said, \u201cthat the courageous and determined working people I have told you about today, and millions more, will get the chance they deserve to build better lives.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s focus on unemployment raised the ire of conservative critics who worried the central bank would lose control of inflation, or that it was underwriting excessive speculation in financial markets. Those predictions have not materialized.Ms. Yellen also emerged as a stalwart defender of the stronger financial regulations imposed after the financial crisis, particularly after President Trump took office and announced that he intended to sharply reduce regulation of the financial sector.Yet Ms. Yellen\u2019s successful management of the economy, and her calm and mild personal style, meant that her interactions with Republicans were largely devoid of hostility. Mr. Trump made a point of praising her even as he made her the first Fed chairman in modern times to complete a first term without receiving a second.\u201cAlthough we did not always agree on the Federal Reserve\u2019s conduct of monetary policy, I have great respect for Chair Yellen,\u201d Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement on Monday. \u201cI wish her well.\u201dThe Trump administration did not publicly press for Ms. Yellen to step down as a governor, but her decision is in keeping with Fed tradition. The last chairman to remain on the board after losing the top job was Marriner Eccles, who was replaced as chairman in 1948 but remained on the board until 1951.The Trump administration did ease Ms. Yellen\u2019s exit, however, by choosing a centrist as her replacement. Mr. Powell has described the administration\u2019s plans to reduce financial regulation as a \u201cmixed bag,\u201d saying that he wants to retain some of the most important stringencies imposed after the financial crisis. He has also supported the Fed\u2019s gradual retreat from its stimulus campaign in the face of demands from some Republicans for interest rates to rise quickly.And earlier this year Ms. Yellen lost allies when two other Fed governors appointed by President Obama, Daniel Tarullo and Stanley Fischer, resigned. That had already guaranteed Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to appoint a majority of the Fed\u2019s board, leaving any remaining Obama-era holdovers with little prospect of real influence.Ms. Yellen\u2019s term as chairwoman ends on February 3, but the exact timing of her departure depends on Mr. Powell\u2019s confirmation progress. Although the legislative calendar is crowded with other priorities, he is not expected to face significant opposition and the Banking Committee scheduled a confirmation hearing for Nov. 28. Ms. Yellen would remain in office during any delay, saying in her letter that she would depart \u201cimmediately\u201d once her successor was sworn in.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Excerpts From the DealBook Conference", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBusiness leaders talked with Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook conference, \u201cPlaying for the Long Term.\u201d Excerpts have been edited and condensed.I\u2019d say this last week 100 million people came through Starbucks stores around the world, and our customers are a diverse base of people from all walks of life and all political persuasions. But yet we are living in a world right now where every day, almost, some episodic event is affecting the way we live, the way we think, levels of anxiety, lack of trust, lack of confidence, polarization, dysfunction. How could we ignore what is going on? We have 350,000 people working for Starbucks \u2014 they expect Starbucks as a company to have a point of view about what we stand for, what our core purpose is and what our reason for being is.And our reason for being is not just to make money. I will go a step further and say the last few years \u2014 as we have engaged in these subjects with respect and civility and have not really taken a political position, just tried to elevate the national discourse \u2014 our business has not been affected negatively on any level, even after we attempted to raise the level of national discourse on race, which I think we should talk about.No. So once again, where we are thinking as a company: What is our role and responsibility in raising the national conversation about things that we think are important? There\u2019s a lack of truth, there\u2019s a lack of authenticity and as a result of that we are trying to elevate a conversation that\u2019s just based on the fact that we want to be authentic.When it comes to making progress in corporate diversity, companies don\u2019t seem to be attacking the issue aggressively. What we hear is, \u201cWe\u2019re working on it.\u201dI always tell people there are 300 million Americans. I guarantee there is someone out there capable of tackling or being trained to fill basically every job. And I\u2019ve heard all the excuses.Not long ago, someone actually said to me, \u201cBlack people don\u2019t want to move to Phoenix.\u201d Now, the last time I checked, black people and all people welcome the opportunity to work with smart people for good pay. Trust me, Phoenix is not a deal-breaker.It\u2019s also been shown that employers expect more of minority candidates. We aren\u2019t allowed to just be good, we must be exceptional.Where we haven\u2019t been great is showing the interpretations of our policies as it pertains to enforcement. And we work really hard to make sure that we are listening to voices, and specifically the journalists on our platform, to determine newsworthiness, and to determine what is public interest and what\u2019s not public interest. In some cases, we\u2019re going to get it wrong. But as our peers have said, like, this is something that is evolving, this is something that\u2019s moving very, very fast. I wouldn\u2019t give us a high grade at the moment, but we do have the intention internally in the company to fix that.My goal is to make sure that we are building something that outlives me, and that endures, and that continues to serve generations beyond me. And that means I need to build structures that aren\u2019t dependent entirely upon me. That means I need to recognize leaders who can succeed me. That means we need to get our decision-making rigor and process and understanding into the very DNA of our companies.I said I\u2019m considering running for president. I think that given the circumstances there\u2019s a unique opportunity for somebody like me who\u2019s independent, who\u2019s not affiliated with a party in any way. I haven\u2019t given money to a politician since 2002 and I think that people are looking for an independent voice, a real independent voice, that at least has an inkling of what they\u2019re talking about.People are tired of politicians and the things that politicians do, and whether it\u2019s me, Bob Iger, Howard Schultz, somebody else, I think there\u2019s a door that\u2019s wide open and I think somebody who doesn\u2019t have a deep affiliation with either party or with politicians has an even greater opportunity.I met with 15, no, it ended up being eight, Democratic senators yesterday in D.C. to talk about health care, so I try to get a better understanding. To me, you can\u2019t absorb enough knowledge and you can\u2019t connect with people enough, and so I don\u2019t want to just limit myself to one silo. I don\u2019t want to be in a bubble.The reason why I\u2019m considering \u2014 haven\u2019t committed \u2014 is because I\u2019ve got three kids. What caring, loving parent would put an 8-, 11- and 14-year-old child through this?There\u2019s a lot of ways to have an impact and the more in tune I am, the more connected, the more educated I am about a variety of topics. the easier it is for me to decide.I was a federal prosecutor for more than a decade and was looking to leave the government, but I still wanted to be doing something that I thought was socially impactful. So I went into Facebook through a legal job and hadn\u2019t been there too long when the company approached me about taking over the policy world. Basically what this means is setting the rules for what people can share on Facebook. So, what can you post, what can you advertise?And over time, this has grown into a community where now we have people in countries all over the world, more than 85 percent of the people that are using Facebook are outside the United States. So it\u2019s this really global community where when we\u2019re setting these policies for what people can share we have to be thinking about what does it look like in, you know, in Turkey? What does it look like in Australia? And craft our rules accordingly.We\u2019re not at the point where we say we\u2019ve got it all figured out and here\u2019s how speech should be on social media. We\u2019re sort of learning as the community grows, how people talk about social and political issues right now. What we do is we say we allow people to come to Facebook to discuss what\u2019s important to them, that\u2019s why we exist.The initial response that I gave under my name was wrong. Period. I own that, and it was one of those moments where you felt compelled to respond quickly as it was escalating on social media. It was a combination, as it always tends to be, a mixture of folks in your ear telling you what to say.It was not what I felt, certainly, and I should have gone with my gut instinct. And at the end of the day when you sit in the offices that we sit in, there\u2019s no one behind you. And so what I felt, what I saw, I should have said so and moved forward from that perspective. That was probably the biggest learning in that regard. There was only one United employee effectively involved in the whole process. It was not their fault. We let the policies and procedures of a mega-operating safety-oriented organization get in the way of simple human values. No one should be treated like that.From my point of view I\u2019ve just been doing the work for 20 years, and a lot of the issues that we\u2019ve been working on are issues of our day. And they\u2019re getting much more prominent. And the work that we\u2019ve been doing is starting to accumulate. But, you know, being on the inside it seems like I just keep doing the same thing I\u2019ve been doing.So the media portfolio came through because we built out a muscle. Because we\u2019re in the social change sector, and when you\u2019re in that sector you have to also look at behavior, and identity, and the cultural narrative. And so that\u2019s why we started doing our own comm stuff, and then we started looking at media, and we realized that if you\u2019re not part of the cultural conversation you could work your entire life trying to, in a Sisyphean way, move things forward and be crushed if you don\u2019t connect with people at the heart-and-mind level.We also believe in the importance of free and unfettered press and media, and its role in our democracy. And we know the business model is weakened, and we also feel that that kind of shoring up and that kind of belief, and the kind of patient capital that we can bring to media companies, is essential for the health and well-being of our democracy. So it\u2019s also as Americans we think it\u2019s really important.I think there\u2019s a trend going on which says clothes are just not that important or as important as they were. And if you go through the audience \u2014 and I always do this at the office when I went to the office every day \u2014 is how old is what you\u2019re wearing, and what\u2019s the latest trend in the world, and what\u2019s this, that and the other thing?I used to call shopping centers the local villages, but you don\u2019t have to go to the village to see other people if you\u2019re on your device because that\u2019s the new way of meeting and seeing and having relationships.I think it\u2019s O.K. to buy clothes, wear them for a night. Someone said to me yesterday that, well, I\u2019m renting clothes by the month, and why should I even buy clothes anymore? So I think clothes don\u2019t play the same role in one\u2019s life as they used to.I mean, you have to sometimes face the reality that something is not gonna grow and it might be going like this, and maybe that\u2019s the state of the retail business.And then what really triggered it for me was Ken [Frazier of Merck] left the council, and when Ken left, when I saw him leave and it became very politicized, and I said, that\u2019s not what I want to be a part of. This is not now something that\u2019s really focused on just manufacturing, it\u2019s becoming more political.It\u2019s a good relationship but it also comes with balance and that\u2019s what I told Travis very early on, is that any new C.E.O. needs space and needs that from the old C.E.O. And so I told him very early on, \u201cTravis, I\u2019m actually gonna be pushing you away early on because I need my space.\u201d I need to be able to meet with a team. I need to be able to communicate with them so that they\u2019re just communicating with me and they don\u2019t have someone to go around if they don\u2019t like something that they\u2019ve heard, etc. So you\u2019ve got to let me engage with the team, engage with a company, engage with the culture.And I was a little worried about that conversation. But, actually, he took it really well and he\u2019s been very respectful, and at the same time he\u2019s been available to me whenever I\u2019ve needed him.Pairing that with the Turner advertising inventory is a really powerful thing. We believe that is what we aspire to do. Selling CNN makes no sense in that context if that\u2019s the business you\u2019re trying to build. So to suggest that I would be interested in selling CNN just doesn\u2019t make sense.I will state again, I\u2019m not selling CNN and AT&T is not selling CNN.I personally think that where we are right now in the world of advertising and media is that there are a couple of players who have built incredibly strong positions and impressive positions in advertising and they are technology companies and I believe that if we are going to compete \u2014 if somebody is going to compete \u2014 with them the best opportunity we have is somebody like AT&T.We have a very strong global economy. I must say, though, prices are more extreme now. So much of corporate profitability is validating the stock market valuations. But we have risen three-plus multiple points, so, you know, we\u2019re not extreme prices but we\u2019re certainly not cheap.But let\u2019s be clear \u2014 the market dynamics are good. We\u2019re being tested as management teams and boards making sure we\u2019re doing the right thing. I do believe we have lost focus and there is too much short-termism, but I think it\u2019s going to be hard. As Ken Chenault suggested, long term is only two years, and I think that\u2019s the equal system we\u2019re all working in. And I would say long term for Washington is about six weeks. So we\u2019re living in a world where everything has been truncated to smaller components of time.I think over all the consumer is in pretty good shape. I think as we all understand we\u2019re not talking about a robust economy. But what is interesting, if you look around the world, the economy has been relatively stable in a range of markets.I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happened for quite a while, and if you\u2019d asked me a year ago how would you feel, I would have told you I\u2019ve got concerns in this region and in this region. And we\u2019re at a point in time where, in fact, things are holding up pretty well.That said, what you\u2019re seeing is a demarcation in performance because there are some companies \u2014 in fact, many companies \u2014 that have not been able to take advantage of the stability, and, in fact, were banking on seeing an improvement in the economy. And so the consumer is there, certainly spending, we\u2019re certainly seeing that on our cards. They certainly want experiences. They like to travel and we\u2019re seeing from a millennial perspective a strong interest both in our products and services but also experiences in travel. I\u2019m not going to predict what the holiday season is going to be, but what I would say is we\u2019ve been very encouraged about the spending.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Wine Books to Give This Holiday Season", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThe fascination with wine begins with the land, which year after year has the potential to produce something different and original from the same vineyard.So it is with wine writers, who each year plow more or less the same terrain, finding novel and provocative ways of presenting their material. Here are five of the most interesting books on wine that were published in 2017, which would make excellent gifts for friends, loved ones or yourself.In transparent prose, Mr. Liem looks back on the winemaking history of the region, which has been obscured in effervescent mythology. He makes a compelling case for the historic importance of place and terroir in Champagne, a departure from decades of marketing that focused on the cellar work of master blenders rather than on the land.While the recent story of Champagne is often framed in terms of simple, black-and-white trends \u2014 the triumph of small farmers, who also produce wines, over the big Champagne houses; the rise of the extra brut and brut nature styles; the increasing importance of single-vineyard Champagnes \u2014 Mr. Liem never settles for the easy conclusion.For Mr. Liem, an American who lives in Champagne, the increasing exploration and understanding of the region\u2019s terroirs is the crucial element in improving the wine and deepening our comprehension of it. But that does not mean, he insists, that a Burgundy-style shift to producing microscopic expressions of the land is in the best interests of the wine or the producers. Nor does he countenance any of the various trends as intrinsic improvements. He is admirably unbiased and authoritative.The history is illuminating, as is the section describing individual growers and houses. Yet the beating heart of the book is a careful examination of Champagne\u2019s terroir, village by village and almost plot by plot. This is enhanced by Mr. Liem\u2019s discovery and reproduction of intricate 1940s-era maps of Champagne, demonstrating that the understanding of the land is not something new, but something old that is being rediscovered.These maps are included as a separate element of a boxed set, a packaging decision that explains the $80 list price. Nonetheless, this is a welcome, essential guide that succeeds in transporting our understanding of Champagne into the 21st century.Ms. Feiring, who has written numerous books on natural wine, and Ms. Lepeltier, a leading sommelier, survey the various geological formations on which the most distinctive wines are grown. Whether granite, limestone, basalt, shale, gravel, slate or clay, each, they argue, imparts consistent characteristics when matched with the proper grapes, particularly when carefully and conscientiously farmed.The link between soil and wine, they acknowledge, is not clearly understood by scientists. Indeed, some scientists reject it, preferring to focus on climate as the most important factor for growing grapes. Yet anyone who has ever compared the chardonnay grown in the Kimmeridgian limestone of Chablis with any other grown elsewhere can\u2019t help but think that soil must play a crucial role in shaping the distinctive qualities of that wine. I certainly do.This book is not intended as a scientific treatise. It\u2019s more a once-over-lightly juxtaposition of soil types and wine characteristics, along with a look at the grapes that thrive in each type of soil and suggestions of wine producers to seek out. Still, it is exhilarating to apply this paradigm to wine, even in a decidedly general way.Ms. Feiring is occasionally prone to eye-rolling self-absorption \u2014 asserting, for example, that she wasn\u2019t the first to discover Barolo, which is a little like reminding people that she didn\u2019t discover fire \u2014 and to unconvincing statements that seem primarily ideological, as in a wholesale rejection of first-growth Bordeaux since 1986. This book, though, is an important and useful challenge to think about wine in a different way.To that end he has enumerated 89 \u201crules\u201d (perhaps a more marketable term than \u201csuggestions\u201d) in no particular order, with the goal of helping consumers to relax and to better discern between what is important and what is not.How to select a wine, how to serve it, how to store it, how to pair it with food: These are among the topics that many consumers find so challenging. Mr. Bonn\u00e9 succeeds in extracting the answers from decades of overwrought expert instruction and presenting them in a clear, easygoing mannerThis is not a reference work. It has no index. Rather, it is a Zen-like reminder that wine is a joy, not a chore; a journey, not a race. Beginners and even confident wine drinkers will find much of value, even leafing through rules at random.\u201cIn Vino\u201d examines the story of Rudy Kurniawan, a wine collector of mysterious wealth and origin, who fooled a coterie of even wealthier collectors along with covetous hangers-on, bilking them all with fraudulent bottles of rare, old wines, many of which he created in his kitchen.Mr. Hellman, a veteran journalist who covered the case, allows the story to unfold with spare prose. He presents, without overt judgment, the macho, competitive, one-upmanship world of the collectors, an atmosphere that perhaps contributed to their gullibility in the high-rolling economy of the early 2000s. This, along with the desperation to possess, seemed a greater motivation among these collectors than an actual love of wine.While Mr. Kurniawan is currently serving a prison sentence, Mr. Hellman acknowledges that many unanswered questions remain. How exactly did the forger accumulate his nest egg? Could he really have been working alone? And for anyone about to open a bottle of expensive, old wine, is it real?Ms. Anson, a contributing editor at Decanter, the British wine magazine, briefly outlines these agricultural and winemaking philosophies and offers capsule profiles of wine producers and their bottles. Her taste is exceptional, and while she at times retreats to the sort of winemaking jargon that you would typically find in a wine-oriented publication, general-interest readers will profit as well.Purists might complain about some of her entries, but I find the absence of rigidity refreshing. The producers she cites, and their ways of thinking, will have you drinking better in no time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Tax Bill Hits Snag Over Deficit Concerns", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate Republican tax bill, which had appeared to be cruising to victory, suffered a setback late on Thursday as lawmakers were forced to contemplate significant changes, including future tax increases, to help pay for the legislation.The bill had gained momentum in the morning when it picked up a key swing vote. But it came to a grinding, if temporary, halt, as senators scrambled in the early evening to find ways to raise several hundred billion dollars after some members objected to moving forward without a plan to safeguard against ballooning the deficit.Lawmakers are now considering alternatives, including reinstating the alternative minimum tax on some corporations and wealthy individuals, and raising the corporate rate above 20 percent after some number of years. A final vote on the bill is expected on Friday after a series of amendments are considered.The push to raise money came after an analysis by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation found that the tax cuts would not pay for themselves by generating enough revenue through economic growth to offset the tax cuts, as Republicans have claimed, but would instead add $1 trillion to budget deficits over the next 10 years.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, had already been on the fence over deficit concerns, and he insisted on Thursday evening that the Senate leadership find a way to mitigate the cost of the bill, lawmakers said.\u201cSenator Corker has been pretty clear he doesn\u2019t want any deficit spending,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican.The last-minute attempt to find revenue slowed, at least temporarily, what had appeared to be a cascade of momentum for the bill. Republicans picked up a key swing vote, Senator John McCain of Arizona, earlier in the day, and had appeared to be on track to pass the bill along party lines.Now, they are under pressure to cut the cost of their bill by as much as one-third, a situation that could require Republicans to insert future tax increases into what was posited as a giant tax cut. That could complicate the final approval of the tax rewrite, particularly with House Republicans, who will be loath to approve a bill that would effectively raise taxes on companies and individuals after a period of lower taxes.Several senators remain on the fence over the bill, and Republicans can lose no more than two of their members to pass the legislation without any Democratic support.Senate Republicans\u2019 tax cut would not pay for itself, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.Mr. Corker, along with the Republican senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and James Lankford of Oklahoma, have expressed concern about piling up more debt as a result of the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul. Other Republican senators, like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, have objected to how the bill treats businesses whose profits are distributed to their owners and taxed at rates for individuals.During a procedural vote on Thursday that suddenly turned dramatic, Republican leaders huddled with Mr. Corker, who had wanted to add a triggerlike mechanism to the bill that would force future tax increases if federal revenues fell short of projections. The Senate parliamentarian deemed that trigger out of bounds under the budget rules that Republicans must abide by in order to shield their bill from a Democratic filibuster.Mr. Corker, Mr. Flake and Mr. Johnson withheld their votes on a Democratic motion that would have relegated the bill back to a Senate panel, before finally relenting and joining their Republican colleagues in defeating the motion. The floor debate on the bill continued, and Republicans were discussing alternative provisions such as slowly raising the corporate rate above 20 percent.\u201cI\u2019m sorry we hit this bump in the road late, because we were moving so well,\u201d said Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia.Asked if the problem could be fixed, he replied, \u201cAnything can be fixed.\u201dOn Thursday afternoon, Republicans dismissed the joint committee projections that the bill would lead to additional economic growth of 0.8 percent over a decade, well short of the acceleration needed for the tax cuts to pay for themselves over that time. The analysis said the tax cuts would generate about $458 billion in revenue over a decade, but would also require about $51 billion in additional interest costs. That would leave the bill with a $1 trillion price tag.The joint committee figures \u201cpointed out that there is significant economic growth,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. \u201cWe think they lowballed it.\u201dEven before the parliamentary snag, critical components of the bill remained under debate, including the size of the corporate tax cut and whether it would retain any ability for individuals to deduct state and local taxes. Still, Republican leaders expressed optimism that they were close to approving the bill.\u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of a great victory for the country,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said earlier in the day, adding that Senate Republicans were \u201cheaded toward the finish line either late tonight or early tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m ready to vote,\u201d said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. \u201cIt is time for us to saddle up and ride and go vote.\u201dMr. McCain, one of the three Republicans who sank the party\u2019s attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act earlier this year, released a statement on Thursday saying that he would vote for the tax bill. One of the other health care holdouts, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, had said on Wednesday that she would vote for the tax bill as well.\u201cI believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle-class families,\u201d Mr. McCain said.But Mr. McCain said that he was satisfied that the tax overhaul had gone through \u201cregular order\u201d in the Senate, with sufficient public hearings and opportunities for amendments. While he said he took seriously concerns that colleagues had raised about the deficit, Mr. McCain said that on balance it would be good for the country.\u201cIt\u2019s clear this bill\u2019s net effect on our economy would be positive,\u201d he said.Other senators remained undecided on Thursday, including Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who said she was optimistic that her concerns would be addressed but was not yet ready to support the legislation.\u201cI am not committed to vote for this bill because who knows what is going to happen on the Senate floor,\u201d she said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Thursday morning.Ms. Collins said she remained concerned about the impact of the Senate plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that most Americans have insurance or pay a penalty, and she also wants to add a provision allowing individuals to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes.On the Senate floor on Thursday morning, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, criticized Republicans for how they had undertaken the tax overhaul, complaining that they had shut out Democrats as they put together their bill.Mr. Schumer said the Republican tax bill had made \u201ca mockery of the legislative process,\u201d and he pleaded for Republicans to work with Democrats on taxes instead of moving forward with the current tax plan.\u201cIf my Republican friends close the door on their partisan tax bill tonight,\u201d he said, \u201cthey will find an open door for bipartisan tax reform tomorrow.\u201dIf the bill clears the Senate, it would need to be reconciled with the House-passed version of the bill, which differs substantially from the Senate version.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Eases Limits on Foreign Stakes in Financial Firms", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Hours after President Trump left China with a warning about its trade practices, Beijing threw him \u2014 and Wall Street \u2014 a bone.The Chinese government said on Friday that it would relax or remove a broad range of limits on foreign ownership of banks and securities firms. The move could inject a little foreign know-how into a vast financial system that helped fuel China\u2019s economic rise but that in recent years has become burdened with debt, bubbles and inefficiencies.Foreign firms may not rush in right away. Global financial institutions have been cautious about investing in China, partly because they would be required to buy mostly Chinese-made telecommunications equipment for their operations here and to store financial data here as part of the country\u2019s tough new cybersecurity laws.Still, the Chinese initiative could help Beijing rally political support from Wall Street banks and securities firms, which have profited from fees on Chinese purchases of American companies but have long been limited in what they could do inside China.Goldman Sachs Group praised the Chinese move, saying, \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s announcement and look forward to playing a greater role in China\u2019s capital markets.\u201dChina keeps tight limits on a number of industries it considers vital, including energy, transportation, the media and financial services. Companies in the United States, Europe and Japan have increasingly complained about being limited in those markets or shut out entirely, even as Chinese companies make their own investments in similar industries outside its borders. In many cases, Beijing\u2019s limits have given rise to Chinese giants who dominate markets at home.Officials in Beijing had previously said the government would open the financial sector to outside money, but Friday\u2019s move offered the first concrete details.Zhu Guangyao, China\u2019s vice finance minister, said that his country would start allowing foreign investors to own 51 percent of Chinese securities firms, fund managers and futures companies, and would allow them to own 100 percent three years from now. The current limit on foreign ownership is 25 percent for large, publicly traded securities firms and 49 percent for most other businesses in these categories.Mr. Zhu said that China would also raise the allowed foreign investment in insurance companies, currently 50 percent for most companies, to 51 percent in three years and 100 percent in five years. China also plans to eliminate its current limit of 25 percent foreign ownership in banks, Mr. Zhu said, but he did not say when it might happen.While the moves were announced several hours after Mr. Trump and his advisers flew to Vietnam, Mr. Zhu said that the initiatives were the result of decisions made during the Communist Party\u2019s congress last month. Trump administration officials shied away from making commitments while in Beijing over market access, the sort of horse-trading that marked previous presidential visits. They have also been distracted by domestic issues and other trade issues.\u201cSpeaking over all, it is a good thing,\u201d said Liu Dongliang, an analyst at China Merchants Bank. \u201cThere will be more different kinds of capital involved, and their management ideas and risk control ideas may arouse some reaction.\u201dAmerican financial institutions cautiously welcomed the Chinese move. Citibank said that its existing operations in China were already growing, with more than $1 billion a year in China-related revenue, and that it wanted to study the details of the new regulations when they were released.China promised when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 that it would rapidly open up its financial markets to foreign competition. Foreign commercial banks were then disappointed when Chinese regulators set high capital requirements for each foreign bank branch, limiting their ability to expand.But the rise of online banking has reduced the need for bank branches, and so has the rise of electronic payments. Over the past couple of years, Citibank has been gradually closing some of its retail branches in China, as it has done in the United States. According to the bank, 95 percent of its retail banking transactions now take place outside bank branches.Yet foreign banks hold just 1.5 percent of the assets in China\u2019s credit-swollen banking system. State-owned banks have flooded credit markets with so many loans that finding large, financially stable, creditworthy borrowers has become harder in China, forcing newcomers to enter the treacherous market of providing loans to smaller enterprises at a time when the entire Chinese economy is gradually slowing.China\u2019s financial markets have a reputation for fraud and manipulation, particularly the stock market. Increasing the role of foreign firms in these markets could help introduce overseas practices that might limit misconduct.Asset management companies have already been expanding their role in China, and the new rules announced by Mr. Zhu could speed that process. Peter L. Alexander, the founder and managing director of Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai financial consulting firm, said that because Chinese investors tended to have large holdings in relatively simple money market funds and had not yet shown much interest in purchasing exchange-traded funds, \u201cthere\u2019s an opportunity for active managers.\u201dMr. Zhu also repeated on Friday a Chinese pledge made late Thursday to ease joint-venture requirements for electric cars and other so-called new energy vehicles that may be built in China\u2019s free-trade zones. Unlike any other large car manufacturing nation, China requires either that all cars sold within its borders be assembled in a 50-50 joint venture with a local partner or that an import tax of at least 25 percent be paid, plus a range of other taxes.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Ran for the \u2018Forgotten.\u2019 Then He Forgot Them.", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHow does President Trump continue to pass for an economic populist even as his policies and appointees are those of an economic royalist? The Republican tax plans he supports are a prime example: They favor corporations and upper-bracket individuals and rely on the long-discredited \u201ctrickle down\u201d theory to offer benefits to workers.The president\u2019s other top economic officials are either investment bankers or private equity managers. Gary Cohn, who heads the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin both came from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, is another prominent private equity operator.This is an administration run by and for financial engineers. The president\u2019s policies have sought to gut what remains of the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation that protects consumers from financial wrongdoing, most recently in his assault on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to eliminate the carried-interest loophole \u2014 which taxes the fees of private-equity fund managers and other investment managers at low capital gains rates instead of at higher income tax rates \u2014 the House and Senate plans leave it intact.Mr. Trump\u2019s administration rewards what we might call an \u201cextraction economy.\u201d Rather than adding value, financial engineers often extract as much as they can \u2014 from operating companies that they buy, strip and sell as well as from consumers, borrowers, workers and other taxpayers.Private equity epitomizes financial engineering. The very term \u201cprivate equity\u201d is a sly rebranding of what used to be called \u201chostile takeovers\u201d or \u201cleveraged buyouts.\u201dFor the most part, private equity companies don\u2019t contribute equity capital. They do the opposite \u2014 loading up the enterprise with debt, paying themselves large fees, cutting jobs and wages and extracting cash, rather than investing in the health of the enterprise. When an operating company is stripped of assets and loaded with debt to the point that it can\u2019t continue, private equity owners then use the bankruptcy code to exit and move on, having already taken exorbitant profits.Much of the undertow on wages and job security is a result not just of global competition or automation but also of private-equity ownership of some $4.3 trillion worth of operating companies, in sectors that include retailing, hospitals, nursing homes, newspapers, rental housing, private prisons, for-profit child care, payday lenders and private universities, employing well over 10 million workers and affecting millions of others. These, as it turns out, are the industries in which Trump voters often work.The operating companies, taken into and out of bankruptcy, are household names, like Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Radio Shack and Albertsons. But the maze of private equity firms, with names like Carlyle, Cerberus and Blackstone, are not.When Mr. Trump was elected, his story was that the Wall Street influence would be offset by self-proclaimed economic nationalists, such as the chief strategist Stephen Bannon and the trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer. Mr. Bannon had counseled bringing back manufacturing, investing heavily in infrastructure, getting tough with China and taxing the rich. Economic nationalism, Bannon-style, might actually deliver something tangible to Mr. Trump\u2019s base.Today, Mr. Bannon is long gone from the White House, busy settling scores with Mitch McConnell. Getting tough with China on trade issues has taken a back seat to enlisting Beijing\u2019s cooperation on North Korea. After a blitz of corporate lobbying, Nafta renegotiation drags on. The power struggle at the White House between the nationalists and the globalists from Goldman is being won by the usual suspects.Why don\u2019t Trump voters get that they are being had? Four basic reasons, I think.First, there is oft-remarked displacement of pocketbook grievances by cultural resentments. But there are three other, more subtle causes.For starters, the sources of economic assault on regular people are opaque. Investment banking and private equity are cloaked in obscurity. The health, safety, labor, environmental and financial regulations being gutted are intelligible only to specialists.Also, Americans famously identify upward. Most don\u2019t mind if billionaires get tax breaks as long as they get a little something, too.This brings us back to Mr. Powell, the nominee for Fed chairman. The abuses that led to the 2008 financial collapse were widely attributed to the low interest rates promulgated by a former chairman, Alan Greenspan. But that\u2019s only half the story. The real economy needs low interest rates. What led to the financial derring-do and the eventual collapse was Mr. Greenspan\u2019s toxic combination of loose money and loose regulation.The current chairwoman, Janet Yellen, wisely coupled loose money to promote growth with tight regulation to prevent speculative bubbles. Mr. Powell, as a Wall Street guy, is more likely to pursue the Greenspan formula \u2014 further enriching financial engineers and putting the rest of the economy at risk.Will Trump voters connect these several dots? I doubt it, unless Democrats will offer something persuasively better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fleur Jaeggy\u2019s Portraits of Past Lives", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionIf Fleur Jaeggy is less well known than many of her European contemporaries \u2014 writers like Joseph Brodsky and Thomas Bernhard \u2014 it\u2019s perhaps because her books are small and few. But over the past four decades the 77-year-old Swiss Italian writer has given us at least two real masterpieces: \u201cSweet Days of Discipline\u201d (1989, translated by Tim Parks), and \u201cS.S. Proleterka\u201d (2001, translated by Alastair McEwen). These are haunting books, both with narrators struggling to retrieve a past that exists only in their memory and through notes and photographs. Like W. G. Sebald\u2019s novels, they depict the mind in a holding pattern, circling around subjects that, being absent, can never be reached.In both these books, Jaeggy recounts a Swiss childhood in the 1940s and 1950s, seemingly a lot like her own: boarding school, a tyrannical grandmother, a divorced mother and father both geographically and emotionally remote. As a writer, she is foremost a portraitist, describing figures from the past as they moved into and out of her narrators\u2019 lives. A fellow student \u201chad a fine, high forehead, the kind of forehead that makes thought tangible.\u201d A father\u2019s journal entries, read years after he has died, are \u201csilent and absent. Names and dates. Nothing else. Written by a man even more absent, precise in his absence.\u201d It\u2019s hard to capture in a line or two the strange precision of Jaeggy\u2019s prose, even harder to explain why her often halting short sentences and sudden shifts in tense or perspective are wonderful rather than irritating. The writing moves the way a camera might, circling around, trying to capture its subject from various angles at once. Out of many perspectives emerge people rescued from paling memory, and \u201cif their faces are forgotten, if certain features have faded, as in a painting, all that remains are our own voices, which we feel can\u2019t be answered.\u201dNow two new Fleur Jaeggy books arrive, very different from one another, both turning her interest in portraiture into a theme in itself. The first, \u201cI Am the Brother of XX,\u201d is a collection of stories, monologues and memoir, less cohesive than her previous books but with the same stark, surprising prose, here translated by Gini Alhadeff. These are grim tales, often violent. In \u201cThe Heir,\u201d an old woman signs over her estate to a young assistant who leaves her to die in a house fire. In \u201cThe Aviary,\u201d a man psychologically tortures his wife out of an obsessive love for his dead mother. The title story and a few others are less traumatic, and there are some lovely personal remembrances, mostly of literary friends. Yet even in these softer, melancholic pieces, darkness seems never far away, and literally isn\u2019t, since much of the book is filled with tales of death and madness.It is also filled, to an uncanny degree, with actual portraits.

And today, Mr. Thanh\u2019s continued detention is complicating the prospects of a smooth completion to a long-awaited free-trade deal between Vietnam and the European Union.Vietnamese business leaders and experts believe the two sides will reach a face-saving deal over Mr. Thanh, who is accused by Vietnamese officials of enriching himself while running a state construction firm.But the episode illustrates Vietnam\u2019s quandary. It\u2019s a rising Southeast Asian power under growing pressure to seek new alliances as China\u2019s rise and America\u2019s shifting politics reshape the global trade order. But Vietnam\u2019s secretive, authoritarian government, and its checkered history with human rights and worker protections, can make striking those alliances tricky.\u201cIt will also weaken Vietnam diplomatically and strategically,\u201d he said.Nguyen Xuan Dien, a political blogger in Hanoi, the capital, likened Vietnam\u2019s predicament to that of a frog sitting in a soup pot. \u201cThe frog is already feeling the heat,\u201d he said.Vietnam could make some sort of apology, or concessions on human rights or labor issues. Several Vietnamese executives said in interviews that they were confident the standoff would somehow be resolved, even if they were not sure how.Le Hoai Anh, the chairwoman of Hal Group, a company in Ho Chi Minh City that distributes and sells European cosmetics, said she worried about trade disruptions or punitive measures that might lead to higher import tariffs.\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly how it will be,\u201d she said of Vietnam\u2019s trading relationship with Europe. \u201cBut we are expecting a bad situation.\u201dThe German Foreign Office said in an email that the Vietnam trade deal would need to win approval in both the German and European parliaments, and that members of both bodies clearly saw the political implications of Mr. Thanh\u2019s disappearance.Vietnam\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not respond to emailed questions.For Vietnam, the upshot would be private-sector growth in an economy that has long been top-heavy with state-owned enterprises and overdependent on development aid. Beneficiaries would likely include companies in both established export industries, such as fisheries and textiles, and also in emerging ones like scooters, smartphones and furniture.Mr. Thanh, 51, had been a senior official in the southern province of Hau Giang and the chairman of PetroVietnam Construction, a subsidiary of the state oil giant PetroVietnam. He was accused of mismanagement that resulted in losses of about $147 million.In late July, he was abducted outside a Sheraton Hotel in Berlin\u2019s upscale Tiergarten district, his lawyers said, and bundled into a car with Czech plates. More than a week later, he was shown pleading for his government\u2019s forgiveness on Vietnamese state television.\u201cGeorge Orwell reloaded\u201d is how one of his Berlin lawyers, Petra Isabel Schlagenhauf, described the episode in a telephone interview.\u201cNobody expected this,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody.\u201dTop Vietnamese officials had asked their German counterparts to extradite him, according to Germany\u2019s Foreign Office. But Ms. Schlagenhauf said Mr. Thanh was convinced he would not receive a fair trial.But Alicia Garcia-Herrero, an economist in Hong Kong who advised E.U. officials on the trade deal, said she believed it would go ahead so long as Hanoi found a scapegoat to blame \u2014 its ambassador to Germany, for example.Germany cannot afford to ignore the potential benefits for its manufacturers, Ms. Garcia-Herrero added, or the leverage that a signed deal would give E.U. negotiators in their continuing trade talks with China.\u201cYou spend years negotiating stuff you can\u2019t ratify?\u201d she said. \u201cThe Chinese will laugh at them.\u201dAn earlier version of a caption misspelled the surname of Trinh Xuan Thanh, a Vietnamese businessman who disappeared off the streets of Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Wealth Shaped Mitzi Perdue and Blaine Vess", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealthGreat wealth in America primarily comes from two sources: entrepreneurship and inheritance. In any age, how people work and create great wealth and how others put to use money they inherited, sometimes many generations removed, speak to the complicated feelings people have around wealth.Entrepreneurs range across every industry, from the esoteric to the fascinating. For a time, tech entrepreneurs who took industry-changing ideas hatched in their dorm rooms and rode them to vast and quick wealth were lionized. Now many in that group are seen as selfishly fixated on the wealth itself.Society\u2019s view of inheritors has always been complicated. Some have been president, like Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, George and George W. Bush, and now Donald J. Trump. Other inheritors have used their great wealth to endow museums, universities or charities, like the Whitneys, Vanderbilts and Rockefellers. Some, of course, have just had tremendous fun with their inheritance, not always to society\u2019s approval.To better understand how the sources of wealth might change one\u2019s view of it \u2014 and life \u2014 I reached out to the multimillionaires Blaine Vess, 36, an entrepreneur, and Mitzi Perdue, 76, an inheritor, who bring equally complicated views to their wealth.In August, Mr. Vess sold the online study-aid company he founded, Student Brands, in his college dorm to Barnes & Noble for $58.5 million in cash. His dorm was at San Jose State University, not Stanford or Harvard. It took him 17 years to build the company. And during that time it was always profitable, growing from $60,000 in revenue when he graduated in 2004 to over $20 million in 2016. He also owned an estimated 80 percent of the company. Last year, he started a second company, Solve, an airport concierge service, and this fall sold it to Blacklane, a global chauffeur service.At age 26, Mrs. Perdue and her siblings inherited Ernest Henderson\u2019s controlling stake in Sheraton hotels, which he had founded during the Great Depression. In 1968, the family sold the company to the conglomerate ITT. She had already lived a privileged life, growing up in Boston, traveling widely and attending Radcliffe College, formerly the all-women\u2019s college at Harvard University. She has had a career as a science writer and public speaker. While her first marriage ended in divorce, her second to Frank Perdue, the chicken king, lasted until his death in 2005. It also gave her great insight into another publicly known but private family dynasty. The result is a recently published book on family business, \u201cHow To Make Your Family Business Last.\u201dHere are edited and condensed excerpts from my interviews with them.What did you want do when you were young?I grew up in Darien, Ill. I graduated from Naperville North High School. I wanted to be an entrepreneur. I wanted to create something. I wanted to work with my friends. I wanted to have fun. All of this was leading toward, I wanted freedom, freedom to live the way I wanted to live, do what I wanted to do. I made more money than I expected. I wasn\u2019t shooting for that. I knew it would be something in technology. I was always gravitating toward internet businesses. Having this outlet, this career path was fortunate.How and why did you sell your first company?I\u2019d been in the business almost 18 years. The key for a lot of older businesses like Student Brands is it\u2019s not the hottest company around, but we\u2019d created a lot of value, and we happened to find a partner who could take that value to a higher level. We thought we\u2019d eventually sell the business. It worked out: right place, right team, right buyer.How was the sale of your second company different? I felt I could apply some of the things I\u2019d learned to airport concierge, which is an old-school business. For me, it was I stumbled upon another problem I had experienced in my life that I wanted to solve. I didn\u2019t intend to go the venture capital route, but when my co-founder and I teamed up a year ago, we felt that the venture route could be an option for us. We applied to Y Combinator [a tech incubator]. That began the very fast-paced journey of building that company. It accelerated the business to a point where it needed more help, or more help than we could supply. We had been working with Blacklane as partners. They were interested in bringing Solve into Blacklane. We felt like it has a good home.What was it like to have money from a liquidity event?I didn\u2019t really know what to make of it. That morning, that was a weird day in general. The deal closed in the afternoon. I think it was Aug. 3. I knew it really happened when the money hit my bank account. I wasn\u2019t going to leave my apartment until it happened. The deal closed, and I went alone to one of my favorite restaurants, Absinthe. I kind of just had a big meal and four drinks. This is 1 p.m. I didn\u2019t know what to do from there. We had a lot of work to do at Solve. I had to get right back to work. It was an intense business.How did the sale of your first company affect you?It didn\u2019t change my lifestyle that much. Partly that\u2019s because I ran a bootstrap business for a long time. I was able to make a good amount of money over a long period of time. Years ago I had bought a Maserati, and then I had a McLaren. I got those things out of my system. There are no more fancy cars coming. I guess for me the way that I think about it is I like building businesses, I like creating something that solves a problem for me and probably solves problems for other people. I didn\u2019t come from a really wealthy family. I\u2019m happy where things are.Do you ever worry about losing the money?I used to. A lot of entrepreneurs like myself, there is still that vision of somehow ending up on the street. It\u2019s an unrealistic thought in the first place. One thing that helped me is I got the advice from a wealth manager who asked what if the business goes to zero? He laid it out. Once you understand if something bad happens this is the plan, that\u2019s very helpful.In what ways has money made life easier and harder?Easier in all the basic ways \u2013 not worrying about a mortgage payment or a car payment and stuff like that. I like to travel but I travel in a frugal way. Being able to travel and not think about every expense along the way, I love that. It all boils down to not having to worry. As for making it harder, I\u2019ve purposely kept things simple. A lot of people hire an assistant who then ends up complicating things. I didn\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t think of any way it\u2019s made things harder.How do you think these experiences and this money are going to make life different for any family that you have? The good thing for me and my girlfriend is we\u2019re both very grounded. I think it was great that my parents didn\u2019t buy me a car. My parents just always instilled working hard in me. I worked at Wendy\u2019s when I was 16 years old. I worked at the grocery store. Some parents would argue that you could have been focused on your education. That\u2019s fine. But for me work was always instilled early on. When I graduated from college, I felt I\u2019d better figure this out because there isn\u2019t going to be this natural support system. I want my kids to work for things on their own. That\u2019s how I got here. Not being comfortable led to comfort.What did you want to do when you were young?How did your parents teach you financial responsibility? When I was 15 years old I was given a job working for my father\u2019s company, the Sheraton hotels. My job at age 15 along with probably 15 other people was to file credit cards. I found it so boring and miserable that I made up my mind that I\u2019d try to get good grades so I\u2019d have a more exciting job in life. I became a much better student after that and got into Radcliffe.What did you do after college?My first job was as a management intern in the Treasury Department, in the commissioner\u2019s office of the I.R.S. It was 20 guys and me. I remember telling my father about my job and being so moved when he said I\u2019m proud of you. It meant so much that I had a job and that I had gotten it not on my name. It\u2019s something I see very much in the Perdue family. You need a job outside of the family for several years before you get a job in the company.What was the sale of Sheraton like for your family?My father died in 1967, and we sold it shortly after that. When it came time to sell Sheraton, there was the issue of whether we sell the company or not. There were strong economic reasons to do it. But on the other side this was our identity. Who would ever love it as much as we did? It was a public company, but we owned the controlling share. I was one who really didn\u2019t want to sell. I thought of my father\u2019s legacy and our identity. Half wanted to sell and half were thinking, don\u2019t do this horrible thing. But by the time of the sale we were united. The reward is 50 years later we still have these family reunions where people come together.Do you ever think of wealth in terms of what is enough?I don\u2019t think about wealth in that parameter. Wealth is power. Do you want to use it for good or do you trust that other people are going to use it for more good than you? You\u2019d be surprised how simply I live. I don\u2019t need wealth for status. The apartment I live in, one neighbor is a librarian, one is a technician at the local hospital, one is working at the sheriff\u2019s department. It\u2019s firmly middle class. I don\u2019t need an apartment on millionaire\u2019s row. I don\u2019t need the money for lavishness. I love that I can support the charities that I support. If you give me a choice between a first-class ticket to Beijing and an economy-class ticket to Beijing, and I can give the $9,000 difference to charity, it\u2019s a no-brainer.Do you ever worry about losing your wealth?No. Let me tell you why I don\u2019t worry about it. It came from my late father. In Dublin, N.H., I watched him chopping wood. He was doing it rhythmically. I said, \u201cDaddy, you\u2019re the head of a major hotel company, you employ 20,000 people, you could pay someone to do this.\u201d He said: \u201cI like this. I like the physical nature of this. But if I lost all my money, it wouldn\u2019t change my mental furniture because I\u2019ve learned on my feet.\u201d Now, do I want to lose my money? I\u2019d prefer it not happen because I like how I live now.In what ways has money made life easier and harder?There\u2019s a whole world of worry, about not paying your bills or having your choices restricted that courtesy of my dear father and my dear husband, I don\u2019t have to worry about, and I\u2019m grateful for it.As for harder, is there any world in which I wished I had been born into a different family and had a different economic background? No. But my sentiment comes from a whole childhood of being prepared.Were there big adjustments going from the Henderson family to the Perdue family?I have often thought that the Hendersons and the Perdues are in parallel universes because we have similar values. Both put tremendous effort into being a strong family. Neither family left it to accident. One difference is the Perdues have been a family business since 1920, the Hendersons have been a family enterprise since 1890. Some of our traditions are a lot older and therefore a lot stronger. I admire both families equally.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Mitzi Perdue\u2019s second husband. He is Frank Perdue, not Purdue.Advertisement"}

But now that China has had such success, it\u2019s time to level the playing field.It\u2019s worth noting how aggressively Broadcom has pursued Qualcomm, especially since all of its previous acquisitions have been consensual. Its C.E.O., Hock Tan, had a conversation with the Qualcomm C.E.O. Steve Mollenkopf last year about a potential deal. But the two didn\u2019t really communicate again until late Sunday, when Mr. Tan called his counterpart and told him about the impending $105 billion bid.Mr. Tan didn\u2019t rule out a proxy fight over Qualcomm: He told Michael yesterday, \u201cWe really know what our options are, and we haven\u2019t really eliminated them.\u201d But he will have to move quickly, since the deadline for nominating Qualcomm directors is in December.

{"Headline": "Thanks to One Man\u2019s Collection, Jakarta Now Has a World-Class Museum", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 For a city of its huge size \u2014 10 million people \u2014 and economic heft, Jakarta lacked many things one might expect of a thriving Asian metropolis: a metro system, for one, as well as a major international modern and contemporary art museum.Mr. Adikoesoemo, 55, says he is determined to add a dose of culture to a city mainly known for its palatial shopping malls and awful traffic. \u201cIf I go to Europe, I go to museums for relaxation,\u201d Mr. Adikoesoemo explained, sitting on the edge of his seat in the dining room of his family\u2019s mansion in the heart of Jakarta. \u201cIndonesia still doesn\u2019t have that culture.\u201dWhile the eclecticism could pose a challenge to curators trying to craft coherent exhibitions out of Mr. Adikoesoemo\u2019s personal collection, Aaron Seeto, the museum\u2019s director, insists that the diversity is a boon.\u201cOne of the things we are really looking at in the program is presenting Indonesia in the world, having conversations between Indonesia and elsewhere,\u201d said Mr. Seeto, an Australian. \u201cThis is what museums all around the world would like to be able to do, but their collections don\u2019t allow them to do it.\u201dCreating Museum Macan has been a decade-long dream for Mr. Adikoesoemo, whose early attempt to collect art was washed away in the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, when his family lost nearly everything. He was forced to sell all of his most valuable pieces \u2014 including a Renoir and a beloved late Picasso \u2014 to keep creditors at bay. \u201cI needed money, so I had to sell all of my Impressionists,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cThe crisis was very tough.\u201dWith an eye toward his future in the family business, Mr. Adikoesoemo was sent to the University of Bradford in Britain, where he earned a degree in business management. There wasn\u2019t much discussion of art in the household, and in his youth Mr. Adikoesoemo wasn\u2019t particularly interested in it. \u201cI always wanted to be a businessman from when I was young,\u201d he said.Mr. Adikoesoemo had an awakening of sorts in the early 1990s, when he visited a friend\u2019s villa on the Indonesian resort island of Bali. The friend \u201chad so many artworks on the wall,\u201d Mr. Adikoesoemo said. \u201cHis house becomes very colorful, very vibrant, very pleasant, so it makes me think, \u2018Maybe I should start collecting art to put on my wall.\u2019\u201d Mr. Adikoesoemo began by buying Indonesian artwork, and then in 1996 began loading up on modernist paintings, including a Picasso.But the good times didn\u2019t last long. The Asian financial crisis struck in 1997, sending the Indonesian rupiah\u2019s value plummeting. Mr. Adikoesoemo had encouraged his father to take on debt to expand the business quickly, and the crisis exposed their businesses as deeply overleveraged.His father had told him he was crazy to have invested so much money in Western paintings, but with Indonesian assets valued at next to nothing, the Picasso and Renoir were suddenly among the family\u2019s most valuable possessions. Mr. Adikoesoemo sold the Western artworks as part of a debt-restructuring deal with 28 foreign banks. \u201cAt that time, my father was 63 years old, so he said: \u2018It\u2019s up to you. If you can solve it, you solve it, it\u2019s yours; if you cannot solve it, there is nothing for you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Adikoesoemo remembered.By the early 2000s, with the economy recovering, the younger Mr. Adikoesoemo managed to pay back the debts and restore the family business.He never forgot that Picasso and Renoir had saved his fortune. \u201cI realized art is an investment \u2014 when you need money you can still get value from it,\u201d he said. But when he went back to buying art in the early 2000s, prices had skyrocketed, so he switched focus and bought mainly contemporary art.In addition to being solid investments, contemporary pieces worked well in his minimalist house, with its high ceilings, huge windows and white walls. \u201cContemporary art, which is very colorful, suits the white well,\u201d Mr. Adikoesoemo said.But he acknowledged that founding a museum, and opening up his personal collection to the world, comes with far higher stakes than finding art that looks good in his house.He even compared it to the anxiety of starting a new business. \u201cThe same,\u201d he said. \u201cThe anxiousness, this generates a lot of excitement and adrenaline.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Long Divided, Iran Unites Against Trump and Saudis in a Nationalist Fervor", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTehran\u2019s Turn: The New patriotsTEHRAN \u2014 The busiest square in Tehran is dominated by an enormous billboard with a drawing of a young man in the uniform of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, extending his hand to invite Iranians to follow his path. Underneath the image, teenagers line up, flashing victory signs, as they take selfies with the placard in the background.After years of cynicism, sneering or simply tuning out all things political, Iran\u2019s urban middle classes have been swept up in a wave of nationalist fervor.At the same time, they now believe they have something to be proud of, with Iranian-led militias playing a central role in defeating the Islamic State militant group in Syria and Iraq, increasing Iran\u2019s regional influence in the process.In short, it appears that Mr. Trump and the Saudis have helped the government achieve what years of repression could never accomplish: widespread public support for the hard-line view that the United States and Riyadh cannot be trusted and that Iran is now a strong and capable state capable of staring down its enemies.On the day of a state-orchestrated commemoration ceremony for Mr. Hojaji, Morteza Hosseinzadeh, a 33-year-old graduate of theater studies at Tehran University who considers himself a reformist, came out early to pay his respects. Dressed in black and holding a poster bearing the portrait of the new martyr, he looked every bit like the hard-line supporters of the clerical government.\u201cThere are many here like me, who don\u2019t care for the Islamic Republic and its rules,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today is about something bigger than that, one of us has been killed. At the same time this American president is breaking our hearts with his rhetoric and threats. We have to choose sides. I choose for my country.\u201dThen came the Trump administration, and its singular focus on Iran as the source, as the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has said on numerous occasions, of all the troubles in the Middle East.Iran\u2019s leaders have begun promoting patriotic causes, recognizing in the changing mood a chance to reinforce their credibility, which had been flagging.Many Iranians now cheer when a missile is tested, said Hamidreza Jalaeipour, a professor of sociology and a leading reformist, \u201ceven those who are completely secular.\u201d The tests, he added, \u201care making them feel strong and safe.\u201dThe pressure from the United States and the growing threats from Saudi Arabia are creating an us-against-them atmosphere, Mr. Jalaeipour said.Yet, in a demonstration of the newfound spirit, Iranians from across the country pitched in to gather water, food and tents and transported the aid with their own cars to the disaster zone.\u201cThere is just a big feeling of unity,\u201d said Pouria Gorji, an office manager who personally delivered four trucks of supplies to the quake area. \u201cWe come together when we are hurt.\u201dThe state\u2019s theocratic ideology has long dictated an artificial version of nationalism, where everything is related to Islam. Love for Iran\u2019s long pre-Islamic history has been illegal in some instances, and often deliberately ignored by officials and state television.But in light of the new national unity, those restraints have been relaxed so long as the presentations encourage patriotism.\u201cI felt so proud. There was an overwhelming sense of unity,\u201d said Soghol Sheikhan, an accountant, who was at the concert. \u201cI got goose bumps.\u201dWithin minutes, Iranian news media, state-run and otherwise, began denouncing his use of the name.Two hours later, Mr. Rouhani, in a live rebuttal of Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, wasted no time with the litany of accusations by Mr. Trump and cut straight to the point.\u201cHow is it that a president has not learned the name of the international historical gulf?\u201d the Iranian president said. \u201cThe same Persian Gulf unfortunately frequented by the American navy, unduly and constantly. Trump should ask his military who have the maps what is written as the name of this gulf.\u201d (In fact, United States Navy maps say \u2018\u2018Persian Gulf.\u2019\u2019)He added: \u201cWe need to understand that the U.S. has been playing with us all along. Trump is proving that our hard-liners were right all these years, to say that America cannot be trusted.\u201dIran\u2019s leaders, on the other hand, long regarded by Mr. Dashtaray as irresponsible in foreign policy, have now \u201cbecome the logical party,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, I love them more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slovenia\u2019s President Wins Second Term in Runoff Election", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLJUBLJANA, Slovenia \u2014 Voters in Slovenia went to the polls on Sunday to decide a runoff election between a sitting president deeply rooted in the political establishment and a former actor who had appealed to the electorate by tapping into concern about the struggling economy.His rival, Marjan Sarec, the former actor and mayor of a small town north of the capital, Ljubljana, received a little more than 47 percent of the vote.Mr. Sarec, 39, congratulated Mr. Pahor, 54, for winning a second term in this tiny Alpine country that was once home to America\u2019s first lady, Melania Trump.Mr. Pahor, who won a five-year mandate, will become Slovenia\u2019s second two-term president since 1991, when the Slavic nation of two million people gained independence after the collapse of Communist Yugoslavia.\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot in this campaign,\u201d Mr. Pahor said in an address to supporters at his campaign headquarters in Ljubljana. \u201cI understood that people want me to speak out more often, and I promise to make their voices heard.\u201dHe said he would intervene to help \u201cpoliticians solve problems, not to deepen divisions\u201d in the nation.\u201cI will work hard to restore people\u2019s faith into democracy and its institutions, particularly those who chose not to cast their ballots today,\u201d Mr. Pahor said.Public opinion experts had predicted a tight race after Mr. Sarec forced a runoff with the widely popular president in the first round of the vote.\u201cIt\u2019s really telling that a candidate like Pahor, with so much experience, skill and popularity, had such a challenger in Sarec, who comes from nowhere and appears to have little to offer,\u201d said Tanja Staric, a veteran political reporter who is now the news editor of Slovenia\u2019s public broadcasting network.Ahead of the runoff, Mr. Sarec had narrowed Mr. Pahor\u2019s lead in the opinion polls, an indication that Slovene voters were in sync with those across Europe, where candidates campaigning from the fringe of traditional political parties and the governing elites have steadily gained support.Nearly 42 percent of 1.7 million eligible voters \u2014 715,096 \u2014 cast their ballots on Sunday, just under the turnout after the first round, on Oct. 22, when 43 percent of eligible voters in Slovenia cast ballots.The presidential election is considered a dress rehearsal for next year\u2019s vote for Parliament. The fight for control of the government will pit the right-wing nationalist Janez Jansa, the former prime minister and the current opposition leader, against Dejan Zidan and his left-of-center social democrats.Mr. Pahor is deeply entrenched in the traditional party system of the left that has ridden the waves of European social democracy since the collapse of Communism. He had served as the country\u2019s prime minister and the president of its Parliament before being elected president in 2012.Mr. Sarec, who was elected mayor of Kamnik in 2010, is better known for impersonating politicians on a satirical radio program than for being one himself, Ms. Staric said. In the past three weeks, however, he had managed, she said, to appeal to \u201cordinary people, the average Joe, who feels left behind in the global economy.\u201dThe collapse of the health care system, unemployment among the youth and the economic recovery were among the major issues for voters. While Slovenes say they do not expect the president to solve their problems, they say they hope that the elected candidate will provide moral guidance to the new Parliament next year.Slovenia is the wealthiest and most socially progressive of the states that have emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia. In 2004, it was also the first to join the European Union and NATO.Yet Slovenia, a country the size of New Jersey, has struggled to find its place in the European Union, with its leaders refusing to partner openly with other Central European countries like Hungary and Poland, which are striving to be one of the 28-member bloc\u2019s core decision-makers, like Germany and France.Mr. Pahor, who led an American-style campaign using social media to lure voters, insisted that Slovenia belonged to that group of powerful countries. He frequently referred to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, as his \u201cfriends.\u201dWhile Mr. Sarec emphasized his pro-European Union stance, he promised to address Slovenes\u2019 concerns about what they saw as the European Union\u2019s failure to hold a unified position on immigration or to find solutions to economic malaise in the eurozone.Slovenia has yet to recover from a downturn in 2009; its economy has shrunk by 8 percent. During the migration crisis in 2015, the country was a front-line country, with tens of thousands of migrants crossing on their way to seek asylum in Germany and Sweden.Last year, Slovenia\u2019s government was instrumental in closing the so-called Balkan route for migrants, working with Austria to its north and fencing off its border with Croatia to the south to stem the flow.The presidency in Slovenia\u2019s highest elected office, but it holds no executive powers. The president is the commander in chief of the armed forces and has the power to dissolve Parliament and call early elections.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Post-Obama Democratic Party in Search of Itself", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "FeatureThe 44th president left office as one of the most popular in American history. He also left behind a party struggling to find an identity \u2014 and to reconnect with voters in time for the 2018 elections.Supported bySeveral members on the call later told me they expected their leader to offer some show of contrition, an inventory of mistakes made or, at minimum, an acknowledgment that responsibility for the previous night\u2019s disaster began at the top. Already, Trump\u2019s sweep of what had for years been Democratic strongholds in the Rust Belt had led to a fast-congealing belief that the party had lost touch with white working-class voters.But Pelosi sounded downright peppy on the call, noting a few vulnerable House seats that the Democrats had managed to hang onto. As for those working-class voters, \u201cTo say we don\u2019t care about them is hard to believe,\u201d Pelosi insisted, according to a transcript of the call I obtained. \u201cI have to take issue and say I don\u2019t think anybody was unaware of the anger.\u201d The Democrats weren\u2019t out of touch, she said. They just hadn\u2019t made their case clearly enough to voters \u2014 or as she put it, \u201cWe have to get out there and say it in a different way.\u201dThe discontent was palpable enough that two days after the conference call, Pelosi announced that leadership elections would be taking place less than a week later \u2014 leaving little time for a revolt to build, which some members I spoke to suspected was the point. By that time, one of Pelosi\u2019s House allies, Doris Matsui of California, had already sent out an email to all the women in the Democratic House caucus, urging them to sign on to a letter of support for Pelosi as leader. Three second-term Democrats \u2014 Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Kathleen Rice of New York and Ruben Gallego of Arizona \u2014 wrote to Pelosi, urging her to delay the elections. Rice would later tell her colleagues in a closed-door meeting, according to notes that were taken by a participant: \u201cLook, I know from losing the state attorney general race in 2010: Losing sucks. But you have to get up the next day and take responsibility for it, take a hard look at every decision your team made, figure out what went wrong and learn from it.\u201dPelosi eventually acquiesced and rescheduled the election for Nov. 30. In the end, her only opponent was Tim Ryan, a young congressman and former high school quarterback star from Ohio\u2019s 13th District, the ailing industrial region surrounding Youngstown and Akron. Ryan offered a splash-of-cold-water speech just before the vote: \u201cWe got wiped out,\u201d he said, according to a recording of his remarks. \u201cWe\u2019re toxic in the Midwest, and we\u2019re toxic in the South.\u201dIn late July, Pelosi, Bustos, Jeffries and Cicilline stood on a stage with six other Democrats under a wiltingly hot summer sky in the city park of Berryville, Va. \u2014 a town of 4,306 residents in a purple district within easy driving distance of Washington \u2014 and unveiled their new agenda, titled \u201cA Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.\u201d The phrase, which had been poll-tested by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was an intentional echo of F.D.R.\u2019s New Deal \u2014 and, less intentionally, of a Papa John\u2019s pizza slogan. But its biggest debt was to the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d and to his crimson-jowled populism.\u201cA Better Deal\u201d called for retraining in America\u2019s fading manufacturing sector, renegotiating trade deals, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and fighting the corporate consolidation that had affected the prices of everything from eyeglasses to beer. None of the 10 speakers invoked President Barack Obama. In fact, one of the key provisions in \u201cA Better Deal\u201d \u2014 renegotiating drug prices for Medicare recipients \u2014 was an implicit rebuke of the former president, who had agreed with the pharmaceutical industry to freeze Medicare drug prices in exchange for its support of the Affordable Care Act.There was a stiff-jointedness to the whole spectacle, a sense of the Democrats\u2019 trying to regain the use of muscles they had let atrophy over the previous eight years. Obama, after all, used to make this sort of thing look easy. Conflating the American story with his own \u2014 \u201cThis is who we are\u201d \u2014 the president conveyed, even in policy irresolution, an unshakable sense of his and America\u2019s place in the world. \u201cI love the guy, I miss him,\u201d Scott Peters said of Obama. \u201cBut organizationally, the party is in disarray. We\u2019re at the lowest level of elected officeholders since Hoover. We got a bit lazy and found ourselves relying on Barack Obama\u2019s charisma, and it left us in bad shape.\u201dBut the Democrats\u2019 path back from the wilderness is not a short one. No president since Ronald Reagan has won the presidency as convincingly, twice over, as Obama did \u2014 but those victories papered over an extraordinary decline in his party that became suddenly unignorable on Nov. 9, 2016. The Democratic National Committee today is an understaffed, demoralized bureaucracy. It has raised less than half of what its Republican counterpart has taken in so far this year. (Other party organizations \u2014 the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee \u2014 are faring better.)Democratic presidents have generally been less than attentive to the financial and electoral health of their party, during and after their presidencies. The Northwestern political-science professor Daniel J. Galvin writes in his 2010 book, \u201cPresidential Party Building,\u201d that since John F. Kennedy, each of them \u201cneglected, exploited or undercut his party\u2019s organizational capacities.\u201d Galvin found that this maltreatment was because such presidents had operated with \u201cdeep and durable majorities\u201d in Congress. After the Democrats lost theirs in 1994, President Bill Clinton awakened to the virtues of party-building. Galvin predicted that Obama would most likely have sufficient reason to do the same.Instead, Obama was every bit as indifferent as his predecessors. After he took office, his campaign\u2019s formidable grass-roots organization, rechristened Organizing for America, became what some party leaders complained was a \u201cshadow organization\u201d that drained resources from the D.N.C. while championing the president rather than the Democratic Party as a whole. The president did not have anywhere near the kind of close relationship with the last D.N.C. chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, that George W. Bush had with the Republican National Committee chairmen Ed Gillespie and Ken Mehlman.In 2012, Obama\u2019s campaign chose not to contribute any money to the D.S.C.C. during that cycle \u2014 and then, emerging from its victory that year with a $20 million debt, the campaign promptly offloaded it onto the D.N.C. In early 2014, Obama assured Senate Democrats that keeping the Senate majority was his \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d Months passed without any further action. Finally, two months before the midterms, Obama informed Harry Reid by phone that he was authorizing a $5 million transfer of D.N.C. funds to Senate election efforts. Reid tersely replied, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been this hard.\u201dFew of the Obama campaigns\u2019 innovations have meaningfully outlasted his presidency. Their once-pioneering digital-organizing operation, for example, went largely to ground in 2016, while the party failed to fully grasp even the basics, like the usefulness of digital advertising. \u201cWhat I can tell you,\u201d says Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, who oversaw an analysis of the party\u2019s shortcomings in the last election cycle, \u201cis that our candidates and their staff told us that the Republicans did much better digitally than we did. And they spent more than us on digital.\u201d (Teddy Goff, Obama\u2019s former digital director, says: \u201cI sincerely wish the technology built in the two Obama campaigns had been put to better use for 2016 and races down the ballot.\u201d)Organizational and technological lapses do not fully account for the Democratic Party\u2019s travails. \u201cAll that stuff is like the field-goal team,\u201d the Obama strategist David Axelrod told me. \u201cNone of it will help you if you haven\u2019t already moved 80 yards down the field. Being technologically proficient wouldn\u2019t have saved Obama if he didn\u2019t also have a consistent, compelling message.\u201dBut that message had grown threadbare by 2016. No longer was it sufficient to campaign on hope and change, or even on the president\u2019s successful efforts in 2009 to stave off a deep recession. The uneven economic recovery raised questions about the party\u2019s obliviousness to the impunity of Wall Street and the gap between the megawealthy and everyone else. Hakeem Jeffries, the New York congressman who was an author of \u201cA Better Deal,\u201d admits, \u201cWe developed a blind spot for the economic challenges that still remained unmet.\u201dRussell, now 33, had spent the past six years at the D.C.C.C. trying to help the Democrats regain the House majority that they lost to the Republicans in the 2010 midterm election. During every election cycle, political journalists and donors would file into one of the drab conference rooms inside the D.N.C. headquarters near the Capitol and watch as D.C.C.C. officials like Russell unveiled maps and polling data in support of the claim that this election cycle \u2014 unlike the last one \u2014 was going to break for the Democrats. Each time, Russell maybe half-believed it.But election night left him reeling. It wasn\u2019t just that Trump had upset Clinton \u2014 including in Russell\u2019s home state, Michigan \u2014 or that the Democrats emerged 24 seats short of a House majority. What gnawed at him was a fear that Trump might actually win over Democratic voters more lastingly. Benton Harbor, a few miles down the road from Russell\u2019s hometown in the western part of the state, lost its last Whirlpool manufacturing facility years ago. The childhood friends of his who remained in the area had renounced the Democrats and were now Trump voters. \u201cTrump could transform American politics,\u201d he remembers thinking at the time. \u201cHe could truly scramble things.\u201dLate on his last evening in Ireland, Russell was drinking a final Guinness and listening to a passable folk band at the Palace Bar in Dublin while halfheartedly scrolling through the news back home on his phone when he came across Rothenberg\u2019s column. He read through to the end with an accelerating heartbeat. It seemed big news to him that Rothenberg, a dispassionate prognosticator, had confidently issued such a prediction just 10 days into Trump\u2019s presidency.Back in Washington, Russell joined a relatively new political media consulting firm, Beacon Media, and started hunting for prospective 2018 House candidates. In early March, he traveled to California\u2019s Orange County \u2014 historically a G.O.P. stronghold, though its wealthy population included growing numbers of Asian-Americans who tended to vote Democratic. In Irvine he met with Dave Min, a wry 41-year-old law professor who had worked on the Hill as a senior policy adviser to Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, and at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.Min, the father of three young children, had never considered running for political office before. But he was also a son of Korean immigrants and was appalled by the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the United States. The incumbent congresswoman of California\u2019s 45th District, Mimi Walters, was a little-known two-term Republican who had never faced serious opposition. She had won by nearly 18 points in 2016, but Clinton beat Trump in the district by more than five points. A strong anti-Trump sentiment in 2018 could work to Min\u2019s benefit. In April, he told Russell that he was in.Russell then traveled to the Illinois suburbs just west of Chicago. Like California\u2019s 45th District, the Sixth District of Illinois had been reliably Republican for decades. But Clinton beat Trump there by seven points, and already its six-term congressman, Peter Roskam, was avoiding public appearances lest he be called upon to answer for the president. The progressive women\u2019s group Emily\u2019s List had referred Russell to Kelly Mazeski, a longtime public servant on local boards and commissions who had already decided to challenge Roskam. Mazeski was a breast-cancer survivor whose platform, she told me recently, was \u201chealth care, health care, health care.\u201d Russell helped Mazeski time her announcement for May 4, the day Roskam and his fellow House Republicans voted for a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.Scores of candidates were announcing their intentions in terrain recently considered inhospitable to Democrats: West Virginia, Texas, Kansas. Some aspirants Russell met lacked the talent to match their enthusiasm. Others were hot property and elected to go with one of Beacon Media\u2019s competitors. But by Labor Day, Russell and his firm had picked up 10 Democratic challengers. Among them were a few beguiling dark horses, like a 46-year-old physician and former Y.M.C.A. national health officer from Portage, Mich., named Matt Longjohn. Undeterred by his lack of political experience, Longjohn was challenging Fred Upton, a Republican who had represented Michigan\u2019s Sixth District for three decades.Russell himself grew up in the Sixth District and cast his first ballot as a registered voter against Upton in 2002. Back then, the incumbent seemed invincible. But now, after leading the committee that wrote the legislation seeking to eviscerate Obamacare, Upton was avoiding town halls and any other public events.Still, when I met Russell recently, his optimism was tempered by previous electoral disappointments. The Democratic Party now has more candidates than it can support, and next spring is likely to be a season of what national Democratic officials tactfully refer to as \u201cmessy primaries.\u201d And even with Trump as a foil, Russell\u2019s candidates were struggling to make a case for themselves. \u201cRight now it\u2019s such a target-rich environment for us,\u201d he told me. But \u201cwe\u2019re having trouble explaining why we\u2019re the heroes and the Republicans are the villains. At some point, our narrative will have to become more coherent than it is now.\u201dOnly two times in the last century (during the Great Depression and after the Sept. 11 attacks) has a president\u2019s party not suffered electoral losses midway into his first term. Those losses \u2014 an average of 32 House seats in each such midterm since 1862 \u2014 increase to 36 when the president\u2019s approval rating is under 50. President Trump\u2019s polling average has never once exceeded a favorability rating of 48 percent, and it now hovers at about 37 percent.Republicans are hopeful that, Trump being the exception to almost every political rule, the historical trends of wave elections will also not apply to him. \u201cClinton came up against a wave in 1994 because he had campaigned as a centrist but then led with gays in the military and Hillarycare,\u201d Karl Rove, the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, told me. \u201cThe 2006 election was a wave because Republicans were defending the Iraq war and crippled by a late-breaking ethics scandal. Democrats faced a wave in 2010 because of Obamacare. So it\u2019s been issues that have driven wave elections. This time around, I think it\u2019s more a personal antagonism to Trump. And the question is, how critical will that be in shaping the attitudes of swing voters?\u201dBut by Rove\u2019s own analysis, two of the last three wave elections were triggered by health care policies that did not approach the deep unpopularity of the G.O.P.\u2019s attempts this year to repeal or otherwise roll back Obamacare. And Trump\u2019s base cannot be counted on to prevent a wave in 2018, because a key constituency \u2014 less-educated white voters \u2014 is a group that tends not to show up during midterms. They may have even less motivation to do so next year, considering Trump\u2019s periodic denunciations of the Republican lawmakers who will need their votes.If this advice sounded familiar, it was because Emanuel advocated the same strategy a dozen years earlier, when he was trying to lift his party out of the trough it had occupied since the Newt Gingrich-led takeover of the House by the Republicans in 1994. Emanuel focused on recruiting more centrist candidates who were well liked in their districts rather than on ideological darlings of the national party. \u201cThe people who criticized me back in 2006 were from my own party,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cWhen I was recruiting candidates, I\u2019d get yelled at: \u2018Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?\u2019 It\u2019s because they were running in red districts!\u201dThe election cemented Emanuel\u2019s legend as a tactician \u2014 none of the Democrats attending the July 27 meeting expressed skepticism about his advice \u2014 but his strategy has never sat well with the party\u2019s progressive activists. \u201cI would just point to the fact that Rahm Emanuel\u2019s Democrats who won in 2006 couldn\u2019t hold those seats,\u201d Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (P.C.C.C.), which supports, trains and funds candidates, told me.She was referring to the nearly a dozen Democrats who rode the 2006 wave into Congress, only to wash back out of it with the Tea Party wave four years later. (Three more had lost in 2008.) \u201cI would suggest a counterfactual,\u201d she went on: \u201cIf we had true economic populist champions who made the case to the American people about fighting for a strong economic agenda, we might have had more lasting success.\u201d Or as the P.C.C.C.\u2019s other founder, Adam Green, put it to me: \u201cIf there\u2019s a Democratic wave in 2018, progressives won\u2019t just ride that wave \u2014 we will cause that wave.\u201dOf course, activists like Green and Taylor also vowed to be the tip of the party\u2019s spear in the previous cycle, with not much to show for it. Indeed, the Breitbart chairman and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon scornfully likens the Democrats\u2019 ideological tussles to a \u201cpillow fight,\u201d further charging that progressives will never accomplish their goals \u201cuntil they have a Breitbart on the left,\u201d he told me. \u201cOur stock in trade is going after the Republican establishment. There\u2019s no one like that on the other side.\u201dMost if not all Democrats are more than happy to watch Bannon\u2019s kamikaze antics wreak havoc on the opposition. Still, some in the party rue the lack of pugnacity on their own side. \u201cThere are two types of Democrats,\u201d David Krone, Harry Reid\u2019s former chief of staff, told me one afternoon this summer in the Midtown Manhattan office where he now works as a consultant for an investment firm. \u201cThere are killers, and there are whiners. Unfortunately, we have too many of the latter and not enough of the former.\u201dKrone considers piety an obstacle to progressive policies. \u201cDemocrats are not that pure,\u201d he told me, with a biting smile. \u201cAll those guys have a transactional component to them.\u201d Under Reid\u2019s leadership, the Democrats managed to pass important legislation like the Affordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act while also thwarting a stream of conservative bills generated by the Republican-controlled House. But it was also Reid who held his colleagues to the deal that garnered the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s support for Obamacare by agreeing to take Medicare drug prices off the table. When the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for outside-group contributions, Reid did not join the chorus of bemoaners. Instead, he ordered up a super PAC, called the Senate Majority PAC, to help keep the Senate in Democratic hands during the 2010 and 2012 cycles. \u201cReid just never pretended to be something he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Krone said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to pass health care? Fine. Don\u2019t make deals. Keep losing.\u201dIn the Democratic Killers Hall of Fame, Krone places Emanuel and Pelosi. But lately, Krone observed, the party seemed to be tilting toward the whiners \u2014 beginning with the excuses offered for Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d he said. \u201cThey freaking lost! They can blame anyone they want to, but they fail to look in the mirror.\u201dThe 2018 cycle, Krone argued, was no time for squeamishness. Again he cited the example of his former boss Reid, who, like many Democrats in 2010, was a heavy underdog going into his final Senate race. Rather than be cowed by a Republican field that, at the peak of the Tea Party movement, had been infiltrated by the party\u2019s fringe, Reid turned that to his advantage. His campaign waded into the Republican primary, targeting the most formidable G.O.P. opponents one by one until the only one left standing was Sharron Angle: a Tea Party favorite who once crusaded against water fluoridation and claimed multiple American cities were under the rule of Shariah law. Reid beat her easily.By way of contrast, Krone pointed to Russ Feingold, the Wisconsin senator who, with John McCain, was a standard-bearer for campaign-finance reform, as well as a crusader for civil liberties during the Bush years. Feingold lacked Reid\u2019s appetite for the jugular, losing to Ron Johnson in 2010 and then again in 2016. \u201cHe had his foot on Johnson\u2019s neck, and then he let up, because he was up in the polls,\u201d Krone lamented. \u201cThey don\u2019t hand out participation trophies in politics.\u201d If the party limited itself to high-minded campaigning and legislating, \u201cWe\u2019ll lose again, and Kennedy\u201d \u2014 the Supreme Court justice \u2014 \u201cwill retire, and Trump will get to appoint another conservative crazy, and the Democrats will wonder how things got to be so horrible.\u201dStill, the party faces a conundrum in its pursuit of Trump voters whose anxieties aren\u2019t just economic but cultural as well. Prevailing in some red districts may require, at minimum, tempering the party\u2019s progressivism on social issues. \u201cWhen anybody talks about a so-called litmus test for candidates, that upsets me,\u201d Representative Cheri Bustos told me. \u201cI\u2019m from Illinois, where I\u2019m the only downstate Democrat in our entire delegation. I\u2019ve been a Democrat my whole life, and my core values are very much in line with what hard-core Democrats believe. I don\u2019t ever lie about my views. However, I also don\u2019t talk about issues that are by their very nature divisive. If asked, I\u2019ll answer I\u2019m pro-choice. But then I\u2019ll get back to the economy.\u201dAdam Green of the P.C.C.C. was adamant on the prospect of anti-abortion recruits: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t welcome candidates who are pushing anti-choice policies into the big tent any more than we would welcome racists and people who want to deregulate Wall Street.\u201d Green wasn\u2019t buying the implication by Bustos and other moderates that the Democratic Party will regain a majority only if it backs away from progressive ideals. He urged me to talk to Rick Nolan, a progressive rural Minnesota congressman who, he said, \u201cwins the right way.\u201dNolan is a folksy 73-year-old journeyman politician and businessman who has long advocated a single-payer health system. He also hunts, fishes, makes his own maple syrup and in other ways stays attuned to the culture of Minnesota\u2019s Eighth District. Taking Green\u2019s advice, I asked Nolan whether he would welcome an anti-abortion candidate into the Democratic caucus. \u201cWholeheartedly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a fault today among Democrats, it\u2019s that they\u2019ve got the worst litmus test known to humankind. If we want to achieve the goals progressives want, we\u2019ve got to get back into the majority. Democrats are damned fools if they don\u2019t see that.\u201dOne rainy late summer afternoon, I met up with the ad\u2019s creator, a 42-year-old Army veteran named Bill Hyers, in a Washington hotel bar overcrowded with well-dressed young professionals. Hyers was sipping an old-fashioned when I arrived. He was dressed in a T-shirt and khaki shorts, his preferred business attire. Hyers has successfully managed the campaigns of well-established Democratic politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, and his own politics are straightforwardly liberal. At the same time, he harbors a Holden Caulfield-esque disdain of insincerity and believes that this quality, more than whining or ideological perfectionism, explains his party\u2019s state of decline.\u201cWhat\u2019s terrible about Democrats like Rahm Emanuel,\u201d Hyers said, \u201cis that it matters more to them if you\u2019re a candidate who can raise money from very wealthy people than if you have an argument to make. They look at everything through the old Clinton triangulation strategy. Put out very carefully prepared statements. Don\u2019t let anyone get to your right. Deny and ignore. Never have an honest dialogue. It was a bad strategy back in the \u201990s. But it\u2019s even worse today, because we can now have 24-7 access to candidates, and people can see when they\u2019re not being authentic. Everything Hillary Clinton did was carefully scripted \u2014 they could see that.\u201d\u201cI can only take a little credit for them,\u201d Hyers admitted after the two-and-a-half-minute ad came to an end. Bryce\u2019s and Melson\u2019s ads, he told me, had a co-producer: Matt McLaughlin, a veteran of TV advertising who \u201cdidn\u2019t know campaigns and politics, but he knows art.\u201d Hyers did not think the party\u2019s need for \u201cauthentic candidates\u201d and a little theatrical verve were incompatible. If anything, the role the confluence of those two perceived assets played in Trump\u2019s victory is one of the few inarguable lessons of the 2016 election.In mid-August, I spoke to Ian Russell\u2019s latest client, a telegenic Marine veteran and two-term state representative from Lewiston, Me., named Jared Golden. Lewiston today is a hollowed-out exoskeleton of a textile mill town. \u201cOur way of life is under attack here,\u201d Golden said. \u201cWe\u2019re a classic case of the America that\u2019s being left behind. The social-identity issues that have been emphasized in Portland don\u2019t resonate in rural Maine. It\u2019s damaged the Democratic brand here, to be honest. We\u2019re a community of hard-working people who may not be highly educated, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not intelligent. The majority of the folks here voted for Donald Trump, and I can tell you that the description of them as a basket of deplorables is just dead wrong.\u201dGolden told me that his neighbors had until recently thought of themselves as Democrats. Golden himself still is. When we spoke, he had just decided to run in Maine\u2019s Second District against the Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin. Golden would be the fifth Democrat to enter the race. He seemed to have little use for the national party\u2019s \u201cA Better Deal\u201d pitch, telling me, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than a glossy new policy document to take back the U.S. House.\u201dThe word \u201cTrump\u201d is not mentioned in the two-minute ad. Nor is the word \u201cDemocrat.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included an erroneous figure for the number of times a president\u2019s party suffered no electoral losses midway into the president\u2019s first term. It is two times, not three.Advertisement"}

It wants to buy and shut down one plant and terminate contracts with the two others. Energy from the biomass plants costs 10 times more than wind-generated power, the utility estimates, and ditching them could save customers nearly $700 million over the next 11 years.Loggers and truckers are suing Xcel in an effort to save the plants.They say Xcel\u2019s plan violates past agreements. The plants support at least 100 jobs, the loggers and truckers say, and bolster the state\u2019s commitment to renewable energy. And without the biomass plants, Minnesota\u2019s forests would be cluttered with damaged or low-grade trees for which there is little other use, decreasing the health of woodlands and increasing the risk of forest fires.As for the farmers who send turkey droppings to the biomass incinerator, they would be stuck with an estimated 250,000 tons of turkey excrement per year.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.The feud\u2019s origins lie in a 1994 agreement between Minnesota and Xcel\u2019s predecessor, Northern States Power. The state agreed to let the company expand a nuclear waste storage site in return for a promise by the utility to generate or purchase power from wind and biomass plants.But after Xcel complained of high costs, the state passed a bill that allowed the utility to buy out its purchase agreements \u2014 though any changes must still get approval from regulators.Xcel declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a statement, it said it was \u201ccommitted to delivering clean, renewable energy at a low cost.\u201dThe dispute highlights the divergent fortunes of renewables like wind, solar and biomass. A dramatic fall in the costs of wind and solar power has driven strong growth in those sectors; biomass, however, has struggled.Scientists have also raised questions about the ecological footprint of biomass and biofuels, which emit carbon dioxide when they are burned.Turkey droppings are \u201cnot as sexy,\u201d he said.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s at best a bug in a complex statutory scheme, not a feature. There is simply no good structural, logical, or constitutional reason why the dead hand of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration should continue to guide the CFPB once Cordray is gone.\u201dAnalysts had long seen Meredith, which publishes Family Circle and Better Homes and Gardens, as being most interested in People, Time Inc.\u2019s most profitable title.

{"Headline": "California Looks at Republican Tax Measures and Sees Payback", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The tax plan hurtling through Congress is a fast-moving blur of cuts and increases designed to keep Republicans on track to pass a bill without Democratic votes. But here in California, where several prized deductions are at risk of being eliminated, people suspect there is a greater design at play.\u201cIt really does feel like they said, \u2018What can we do to California?\u2019\u201d said Sam Moss, executive director of Mission Housing, an affordable-housing developer in San Francisco.Mr. Moss is worried about the threat to an array of tax credits and tax-exempt bonds that are widely used to build low-cost housing in a state with a severe housing shortage.And it\u2019s not only the housing incentives. The tax bills are filled with measures that Democrats, and some Republicans, say would have a disproportionate and damaging impact on an overwhelmingly Democratic state that has portrayed itself as the center of resistance to President Trump.In the sharpest example, state officials estimated that over six million California taxpayers \u2014 one of every three \u2014 take a deduction for state and local taxes. That is one of the main deductions Republicans are moving to eliminate or severely restrict. The bills would also put a ceiling on a deduction for mortgage interest used by more than four million California taxpayers, according to the State Department of Finance.The bills would phase out the ability to deduct personal casualty losses from wildfires and earthquakes \u2014 a constant threat in vast parts of the state \u2014 but keep the deduction for damage from hurricanes and floods like those in Florida and Texas this year.\u201cI would like to think that this isn\u2019t directly aimed at California, but it\u2019s hard not to think that Congress has their sights set on the Golden State,\u201d said State Senator Mike McGuire, a Democrat whose district includes areas ravaged by the recent wildfires in the north. \u201cNo matter if it\u2019s an earthquake, a wildfire or a hurricane, families should be able to deduct the damage.\u201dCalifornia is overwhelmingly Democratic. Hillary Clinton outpolled Mr. Trump by nearly four million votes here, and Democrats control both houses of the Legislature. Party leaders have been at the forefront of denouncing Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on issues from the environment to health care.There has long been concern here that the state\u2019s confrontational stance toward the Trump administration could invite retribution from Washington.Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, said in an interview that the rush by Republicans to pass a bill made it impossible to judge how much the legislation could hurt the state.\u201cI can\u2019t penetrate the inner motivations of the Republican leadership,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cBut I will say there is something very odd about their rushing this very gigantic tax proposal through Congress without serious transparency or debate. They are doing so primarily, it seems, to reward their corporate donors.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like this way to govern in a democracy,\u201d he said.Representative Darrell Issa, whose San Diego County district is among the most vulnerable Republican seats in the state, said he would oppose the bill.\u201cI cannot endorse changes that may make the tremendous burden felt by California taxpayers even worse,\u201d he said. \u201cTax reform should lower taxes for all taxpayers \u2014 regardless of where they live.\u201dBut so far, Mr. Issa\u2019s opposition appears singular within the state\u2019s Republican delegation, at least among those who will offer comment. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader, who represents a Central Valley district, strongly backed the effort. He said other parts of the bill \u2014 such as increasing the standard deduction and eliminating the alternative minimum tax \u2014 would help California taxpayers who were, he said, saddled with high state taxes.State Senator Jeff Stone, a Republican, also endorsed the effort, saying it would bring welcome relief to California taxpayers.\u201cThe Democrats keep raising taxes in California,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time the federal government stops letting them off the hook by giving them cover with an overly complicated federal tax system.\u201dOn the Democratic side, Anthony Rendon, the Assembly speaker, called the bill \u201canti-California,\u201d and said he was surprised that so few California Republicans had spoken against it, especially in contrast to Republicans in other states, like New York, that would also be hurt.\u201cIt\u2019s to a large extent political suicide for a lot of these folks,\u201d he said, \u201cand they don\u2019t seem to care.\u201dFor instance, both the House and Senate bills either reduce or repeal the deduction for state income, sales and property taxes. California\u2019s top personal income-tax rate is the nation\u2019s highest.The House bill lowered the limit on the mortgage-interest deduction for new home purchases from $1 million in debt to $500,000. That move would affect fewer than 3 percent of mortgage holders nationally, and there are only four metropolitan areas in the United States where more than half of the homes are priced above $500,000. All four are in California. (The Senate bill keeps the limit at $1 million.)Also, no state benefits more from itemized deductions, which the bills limit, and in many cases discourage, by increasing the standard deduction. Economic models suggest that the bulk of the millions of families that would face tax increases under the legislation itemize their deductions.More than a third of Californians itemize their deductions, according to data compiled by the Pew Charitable Trusts; the average benefit from those deductions was nearly $37,000 in 2015.California is not the only state whose voters would lose deductions from the tax bill. According to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, an independent think tank, six states \u2014 California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas and Pennsylvania \u2014 claim more than half of the total amount deducted for state and local taxes.Conor Dougherty reported from San Francisco, and Adam Nagourney from Los Angeles.

{"Headline": "A Trump for All Ages", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo People Like Show PeopleThe conventions industry pays big bucks for impersonators. How do they solve a problem like The Donald?Randy Nolen is a 66-year-old talent manager based in Indian Wells, Calif. He specializes in the meetings and conventions sector. His clients seek acts that can entertain, say, a thousand conference attendees who have nothing in common except that they work in the insurance industry. Long ago, Mr. Nolen realized that everyone knows the president of the United States, and everyone likes to make fun of the boss. Thus, his bread and butter for the last 25 years has been booking and managing performers who portray the president. In the 1990s, he did well with a natural Bill Clinton look-alike named Tim Watters. In the 2000s, he hit it big with Steve Bridges, who used elaborate facial prosthetics to transform into a striking likeness of George W. Bush.While the corporate clients want unique and memorable performers, they generally don\u2019t want anything risqu\u00e9 or offensive. That\u2019s why the buzzword that guides Mr. Nolen is \u201crespectful.\u201d He encourages the entertainers he represents to \u201cpoke fun\u201d at the president, in a clever but civil way. \u201cOur objective is to make people chuckle and say, \u2018Gosh, that was fun,\u2019\u201d Mr. Nolen said. \u201cWe\u2019re not political people. We\u2019re not going to change any policy with this. We\u2019re entertainers. Our job is to make everybody laugh, in a way that even the president and his family will like.\u201dA decade ago, Mr. Nolen achieved that with Mr. Bridges, who performed alongside Mr. Bush at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in 2006, and also at a private birthday party at the White House. According to Mr. Nolen, George H.W. Bush approached Mr. Bridges after his show, saying, \u201cSteve, I just want to thank you. Your material is so gracious.\u201d\u201cAlec Baldwin is playing a buffoon,\u201d he said. \u201cAnthony Atamanuik is meanspirited. It\u2019s like Dr. Evil. It\u2019s a demonlike character. The problem is, that\u2019s not Trump. You\u2019re playing him out of character and it\u2019s not believable.\u201dIn the early 1990s, Mr. Nolen had no interest in look-alikes. \u201cThere was no money in it,\u201d he said. Because they showed up, waved, and then did meet-and-greets, the appearance fees they could command were limited. \u201cThey were getting $500 to $750 a night.\u201dThen, a colleague of Mr. Nolen\u2019s insisted he meet a former real estate salesman named Tim Watters, who had started making appearances at corporate events because of his resemblance to America\u2019s new president, Bill Clinton. When Mr. Nolen\u2019s acquaintance spotted Mr. Watters at a Motorola conference, he said the executives there were practically falling over themselves to get a photo with him. While Mr. Nolen was skeptical, he agreed to meet with Mr. Watters. \u201cFrom the nose up, he looked exactly like Bill Clinton,\u201d Mr. Nolen said.That still wasn\u2019t enough. But when Mr. Watters agreed to develop an actual stand-up act that would allow him to charge more for performances, Mr. Nolen started booking gigs for him.In their best year together, 1996, Mr. Nolen said he booked 177 dates for Mr. Watters at $10,000 a performance. When President Clinton was re-elected that year, Mr. Nolen urged Mr. Watters to expand his act, from 30 to 45 minutes, so that they could increase their fee. \u201cMost convention and meetings planners want a full hour if they can get it,\u201d Mr. Nolen said.But Mr. Watters didn\u2019t want to invest the money into writers who could help expand his act. \u201cThat\u2019s when I said, \u2018If I ever do this again, I\u2019m going to find a guy who\u2019s got the will and the talent, and then I\u2019m going to find a prosthetic makeup artist and make him look like the president,\u2019\u201d Mr. Nolen said.Squint, and you might say Don Jr. Mr. Burleigh has brown hair, hazel eyes, round cheeks and a puckish grin. At 48, he still looks boyish.That started to change, however, as Kevin Haney, a Hollywood makeup artist, retrieved an individually cast silicone ear, an individually cast silicone eye bag and so on, and methodically covered Mr. Burleigh in a thin layer of Trump. \u201cWhat is the toxicity of this stuff?\u201d Mr. Burleigh asked, as Mr. Haney brushed a Q-tip dipped in denatured alcohol against the silicone replica of Donald Trump\u2019s left cheek glued to Mr. Burleigh\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s all medical grade \u2014 completely safe,\u201d Mr. Haney said.Recruited by Mr. Nolen more than a year ago, Mr. Burleigh has made three brief appearances as President Trump at Southern California comedy clubs. Now, Mr. Haney is prepping him for his first official paid gig in the role, a private party in a restaurant.Over the course of his long career, Mr. Haney has helped transform actors into monsters, aliens, apes, corpses and extremely old versions of themselves. In 1990, he was part of the makeup team that won an Oscar for their work in \u201cDriving Miss Daisy.\u201d He turned Courteney Cox into \u201cFat Monica\u201d on \u201cFriends.\u201dNo character, however, has ever challenged him like Mr. Trump has.\u201cHe has so many angles. He has so many odd things going on,\u201d Mr. Haney said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most difficult job I\u2019ve ever done. I say this without any hesitation.\u201dMr. Nolen believes he can blame it all on James B. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I.Like many people, Mr. Nolen had started paying attention to the 2016 presidential election well before the primaries got underway, though his interest was driven by a tragedy several years earlier.While Steve Bridges\u2019s busiest year as President Bush was in 2006, he continued to get jobs for this portrayal well after Mr. Bush left office. In 2012, days after the 48-year-old Mr. Bridges had returned from playing Mr. Bush in China, he died unexpectedly.\u201cIt was a complete shock,\u201d Mr. Nolen said. \u201cHis brother told me the official coroner\u2019s report said it was anaphylactic reaction, caused by a chemical in an herb.\u201dIn the two years afterward, Mr. Nolen tried to develop other acts built around what he calls \u201clikeness prosthetics,\u201d but nothing came to fruition. He decided to get an early jump on the 2016 election. \u201cI really thought Hillary was going to get indicted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe server thing. There was so much against her.\u201d And when that happened, he reasoned, the Democrats would have to replace her with a last-minute stand-in. So Mr. Nolen started looking for someone who could play Joe Biden. Mr. Burleigh, who impersonates a wide range of Hollywood celebrities, had never thought to include Joe Biden in his act. But he did know all about the success Steve Bridges had playing George W. Bush. At his peak, Mr. Bridges had earned far more to play the president than the president himself earned in salary for the job.Anticipating a similar payday, Mr. Burleigh signed a contract with Mr. Nolen.\u201cRandy had me over for dinner when I was doing a show in Palm Springs,\u201d Mr. Burleigh said. \u201cHe took out the contracts we\u2019d written a year and a half earlier. And wherever it said \u2018Joe Biden,\u2019 he just crossed it out and wrote \u2018Donald Trump.\u2019\u201dOn Election Day, Mr. Burleigh was on a cruise ship in the Caribbean, drinking in the crew bar at 4 a.m., after performing a gig that night. \u201cThere were all these people from all these different countries, just baffled,\u201d he said. \u201cThis big Russian guy was sitting next to me, and he goes, \u2018Now let me get this straight. This Donald Trump, he is reality star, yes?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 And he said, \u2018And he\u2019s going to be president of the United States, yes?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, it looks that way.\u2019 And he gets this big smile on his face and says, \u2018Only in America!\u2019\u201dThe first time that Mr. Haney built a new face for Mr. Burleigh in July, Mr. Burleigh thought he ended up looking more like Liberace than Donald Trump. \u201cRandy kept saying, \u2018This is just a test.\u2019 But I was worried,\u201d Mr. Burleigh said.The second time, one of the other comics at the club where Mr. Burleigh performed just sat there and glared at him. \u201cShe was looking at Dave like he was some evil creature,\u201d Mr. Nolen said.With Mr. Bridges, Mr. Haney got so good at simulating the look of Mr. Bush that people sometimes thought they were meeting the actual president when shaking his hand. Mr. Burleigh is not at that level yet, but in the meet-and-greets he has done, he said people are already addressing him as if he is the president: \u201c\u2018I didn\u2019t vote for you,\u2019 they\u2019ll say, \u2018but my mom\u2019s going to love this picture.\u2019\u201dTo achieve even that level of verisimilitude takes around four hours and a great deal of patience. As Mr. Haney blended the edges of various silicone pieces, Mr. Burleigh held a small red fan to his face to mitigate the fumes from the solvents.\u201cCan I get a tissue here?\u201d he asked. \u201cMy eye is sizzling a bit.\u201dOnce Mr. Haney finished applying the silicone, he started using a low-pressure spray gun to speckle it with tiny dots of color \u2014 mostly reds, pinks and browns. \u201cI\u2019ve done the super-orange Trump makeup on a couple other jobs,\u201d Mr. Haney said. \u201cBut it\u2019s distracting. I try to give a hint of that, but I don\u2019t overdo it. I\u2019m not going to make him into an Oompa Loompa. It\u2019s not that kind of show.\u201dMr. Burleigh, too, has no intention of turning Mr. Trump into an Oompa Loompa.\u201cWhen all of this started, I was at lunch with one of my comedian friends and I told him about the project,\u201d Mr. Burleigh said. \u201cAnd he goes, \u2018Well, if you can sleep at night.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Comedians have been doing impressions of politicians forever, all the way back to the jesters and the kings. This is a form of entertainment.\u2019 Then, he kind of gave it a beat and said, \u2018Well, just don\u2019t humanize him.\u2019\u201dSteve Bridges certainly did that with George W. Bush. Indeed, as President Bush\u2019s approval ratings dropped in the face of endless war and a slowing economy, Mr. Bridges\u2019s popularity grew.And, according to Mr. Nolen, his core audience was conservatives and Republicans, not liberals. In his portrayal of Mr. Bush as an endearing, simple, but occasionally sly regular guy, Mr. Bridges gave them a Dubya unsaddled by history \u2014 the folksy blue-blood cowboy who had once promised to help \u201cmake the pie higher\u201d and sympathized with how hard it was for average Americans to \u201cput food on their families.\u201dIn the Trump era, when it sometimes feels as if we are no more than a tweet away from nuclear war, civil war or nuclear civil war, there are millions of people who have zero interest in a similarly sympathetic depiction of Mr. Trump. And there are millions of people who are no doubt tired of seeing Mr. Trump depicted only as a sour buffoon or an evil mastermind. In a recent tweet, the president himself pressed for \u201cEqual Time\u201d on the nation\u2019s late-night TV shows.Now that possibility exists.At 5:38 p.m., Mr. Haney finally stepped away from Mr. Burleigh. After sitting with low-energy calm for more than three and a half hours, Mr. Burleigh burst into motion. He ducked into a nearby closet, where he put on a fat suit that gives him a pot belly and some larger-than-average junk in the trunk. Finally, Mr. Burleigh slid on a wig that is essentially a horseshoe-like fringe of white-blond hair that leaves the top of his head bald.It\u2019s temporary \u2014 he is having a better one made, at a cost of $10,000, by a wig maker who has designed pieces for Cher and Jennifer Aniston. Her services are in such high demand that she won\u2019t be able to complete it for several weeks. As Mr. Burleigh exited the hotel lobby and started to walk down the street, diners inside a nearby restaurant spotted him through the window and whipped out their cellphones to take photos. Passers-by slowed and did double takes.After a couple of blocks, Mr. Burleigh broke left with statesmanlike authority, toward the staff entrance of the 555 East American Steakhouse. As he waited outside for his cue to enter, Mari Okumura, Mr. Haney\u2019s assistant, dabbed at the left side of Mr. Burleigh\u2019s face in a last-minute attempt to improve the contouring of his plump, patrician jowl.Ten yards away, two women from the Netherlands looked on from a polite distance. \u201cWe were wondering, is it him?\u201d one said. \u201cWe thought maybe he is here for the wildfires?\u201d A few minutes later, Mr. Burleigh strode into a private banquet room to the strains of \u201cHail to the Chief.\u201dApproximately 30 men, middle-aged and up, filled tables. Some showed obvious delight at the appearance of their surprise visitor.\u201cGood to be here. Great to be here,\u201d Mr. Burleigh purred from behind a podium at the front of the room. \u201cI was expecting more people. My birthday party had a billion people.\u201cA lot of traffic getting down here tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t these Hollywood liberals promise to leave the country if I got elected? Liars!\u201dMr. Burleigh played the president in his schmoozy, self-satisfied M.C. mode \u2014 not rousing the rabble so much as nuzzling it. And when Mr. Burleigh closed his act by singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to the 80-year-old guest of honor, everyone in the room joined in with great strength and stamina, buoyed by the bonhomie of Mr. Burleigh\u2019s engaging presence.It was a winning performance, with a notable subtext. Not just because Mr. Burleigh effectively sanitized the president by avoiding topics of any controversy, but also in the way he elevated him. He did not insult protesting athletes, or belittle a Puerto Rico mayor, or feud with war widows. Here at last was a leader with all of the discipline, decorum and empathy that many have traditionally associated with the office of the president. For the meetings and conventions sector, that\u2019s fantastic news.Advertisement"}

Others browsed tote bags that read, \u201cThe Future is Female,\u201d and sniffed car air fresheners labeled \u201cNasty Woman.\u201dRather than merchandise its own goods, Bulletin Broads functions more like a mini-flea market, renting its shelf space to emerging brands seeking a brick-and-mortar presence. And it does so with a political bent.\u201cWe think of Broads as both a store and feminist brand collective,\u201d said Ali Kriegsman, 26, one of its founders. \u201cIt\u2019s where like-minded women can meet and create a small hub of resistance.\u201dThe NoLIta store, as well as its predecessor in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, is stocked exclusively with feminist-minded merchandise created by small brands run by women. Ten percent of all proceeds go to Planned Parenthood of New York City. The stores have raised more than $43,000.But Bulletin Broads did not start out as a store. Its first iteration was a \u201cshop-able\u201d magazine that featured designer profiles alongside merchandise. \u201cWe wanted to take what was happening at the Brooklyn Flea with all these cool, underground brands, pluck the best ones and give them a digital home,\u201d Ms. Kriegsman said.The result was a highly curated version of Etsy. Indeed, Ms. Kriegsman and her business partner Alana Branston would comb Etsy and Instagram to pick their vendors.They sent out their first newsletter (or bulletin) in 2015. It featured an architectural rocking chair, a cheeky ashtray and locally made soaps.Sales had stalled. \u201cWe interviewed all the brands and figured out they didn\u2019t really want another online sales channel,\u201d Ms. Kriegsman said. \u201cThey wanted a physical presence.\u201dSo Bulletin began hosting a weekend flea market, renting an 18,000-square-foot parking lot in Williamsburg and offering stalls for a fee. The women began to bring in a healthy income but realized the weekly schlep wasn\u2019t sustainable. \u201cEvery weekend we would wake up at 7 a.m. to set up,\u201d Ms. Branston, 30, said. Last year, they set up a 450-square-foot shop at 145 Wythe Avenue in Brooklyn.Borrowing a page from the sharing economy, they rented out shelf space to emerging brands that can\u2019t afford their own stores.

{"Headline": "In China, Fears That New Anticorruption Agency Will Be Above the Law", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, is pushing to establish a new anticorruption agency with sweeping powers to sidestep the courts and lock up anyone on the government payroll for months without access to a lawyer \u2014 a plan that has met surprisingly vocal opposition from some of the nation\u2019s foremost legal minds.The proposal is audacious even by the standards of the Chinese Communist Party, which is notorious for relying on secretive detention but has also proclaimed the rule of law as essential to a modern economy. Dozens of lawyers and law professors from China\u2019s academic mainstream have risked retaliation by speaking out against the plan, in the first substantial public challenge to Mr. Xi\u2019s second-term agenda.Opponents say the legislation would violate China\u2019s Constitution and give the new commission carte blanche to operate beyond the scope of Chinese laws, especially those meant to prevent arbitrary arrest.By opposing the new commission, Professor Tong and others have raised broader questions about the strength and independence of the Chinese legal system, and whether it can be used to rein in the power of party leaders who have often set themselves above the law.Many critics of the proposed commission are law professors who teach at prestigious schools in Beijing and Shanghai, and who have kept away from the front line of human rights cases. As they have come forward in recent weeks to criticize the new commission, they have striven to cast themselves in the role of a loyal opposition.The lawyers and legal experts are treading a fine line by not challenging the rule of the Communist Party, but rather calling on the party to honor its own commitments to the rule of law.The commission\u2019s critics have voiced their opposition not in street protests, but via meetings of legal professionals, and in joint statements and legal commentaries online. But their criticisms are pointed nonetheless.They say the new watchdog would violate the Constitution by creating, out of legal thin air, a new body whose vague powers would equal or even surpass those of China\u2019s courts and legislature.Some critics of the law have played a cat-and-mouse game with censors, posting harsh criticisms of the commission on WeChat, a popular Chinese social media service, that are quickly taken down.\u201cIf there\u2019s no freedom to criticize, then soliciting opinions is completely meaningless,\u201d said one comment, which was also removed by censors.The new commission would take over from the party watchdog, but with broader investigative reach. While the current agency\u2019s focus has been limited to Communist Party members, the new commission would be empowered to examine anyone on the public payroll, including the millions of government employees who are not party members.The new commission will also have the power to detain people for three months in secret, with the possibility of a three-month extension. This will give it the same draconian powers of detention that the current party watchdog uses solely against party members.The National People\u2019s Congress has invited comments until Dec. 6 on the proposed law to create the commission. But the congress is packed with officials handpicked for their loyalty to the party, and they are unlikely to delay or overhaul the plans. The legislation is likely to pass when the congress meets for its next annual session, probably in March next year.Most opponents see little hope of delaying the new commission\u2019s creation, but they said they still hope to blunt what they call the most dangerous shortcomings.\u201cThat decision is up to the party central leadership,\u201d Professor Tong, the Shanghai academic, said. \u201cAs legal experts, and as citizens, we\u2019re just doing everything we can to fulfill our duty to offer our opinions.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rebuild New York Subways Under New Leadership, Report Urges", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixing New York City\u2019s subway crisis will require taking the drastic step of creating a state-controlled corporation dedicated solely to rebuilding and modernizing the city\u2019s teetering subway system, according to a new report from an influential urban research and advocacy group.The subways are currently operated and financed by the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees a sprawling network of subways, buses, railroads, bridges and tunnels. The report described the authority as \u201can enormous legacy institution\u201d hobbled by competing internal priorities, bureaucratic rules and practices, and a lack of funding. As a result, the report said, it has been too slow to make improvements and adopt modern technology, leaving a backlog of critical infrastructure projects.One of the group\u2019s boldest suggestions takes aim at one of the subway\u2019s most cherished qualities \u2014 that it never closes. The association said the subway should be shut down in the wee hours to more rapidly fix what is broken and add the upgrades that are sorely needed.The report took five years to produce and aims to provide a comprehensive blueprint for the future. It is only the fourth such report to be released by the association in nearly a century. Three previous reports \u2014 in 1929, 1968 and 1996 \u2014 helped lay the groundwork for public works projects, including bridges and highways, economic development, and preservation of parkland and open space. The 1996 report called for building a Second Avenue subway and creating a business district on the Far West Side of Manhattan, both of which are now a reality.The fourth report looks broadly at the transportation system in the New York region, saying its failures are the consequence of years of underinvestment even as demand for services grew and advancing technology raised customer expectations. It proposes building a second bus terminal under the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on Manhattan\u2019s West Side to consolidate intercity buses and free up space at the crowded Port Authority Bus Terminal, and expanding subway and regional rail service and connections.Though the report acknowledged that the authority has managed to rescue the subway from past crises, it contends that the authority is no longer up to the job. \u201cThe M.T.A., as currently funded and structured, cannot keep up,\u201d the report said. \u201cUnless we can find new ways to deliver improvements and modernization, the subway system will continue to slip further behind.\u201dIn response to the report, Joseph J. Lhota, the transportation authority\u2019s chairman, said in a statement: \u201cWhile we don\u2019t need to create a new bureaucratic structure, we agree that securing a dedicated revenue source \u2014 preferably one that also battles congestion \u2014 is essential.\u201dMr. Rechler said a more efficient and focused organization was vital to lead the subway overhaul. While details would be worked out later, he said that the new subway corporation could operate with more flexibility than traditional government agencies, which are often bound by outdated rules and regulations.\u201cWe\u2019re asking the public for a multibillion-dollar commitment to get this done,\u201d Mr. Rechler said. \u201cI think it\u2019s critical that it goes into an organization that is designed to solely execute on this mission.\u201dThe report\u2019s to-do list for the subways includes building new subway lines to underserved areas and reducing crowding at stations by creating larger entrances, enlarging corridors and mezzanines, and moving nonessential structures such as newsstands from platforms. It also advocates increasing access for riders with disabilities and making subway stations more bearable through better ventilation and more natural light. Though the authority has already started to make some improvements, such as updating signals, the report said the pace is so slow it could take decades to finish.The report calls for closing the 24-hour subway system in the early morning hours during the week for routine maintenance and increasing bus service as an alternative. An average of 85,000 riders are on the subways between 12:30 a.m. and 5 a.m., or just 1.5 percent of the total daily ridership, according to the report.It also recommends taking advantage of longer closings of subway lines not only to make necessary repairs but also to focus on enhancements like power and track upgrades. Tom Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, pointed to the L train tunnel between Brooklyn and Manhattan, which will close in 2019 to repair damage caused by Hurricane Sandy.\u201cIt makes sense for the M.T.A. to shut the L train down for 15 months, but they need to deliver a better system when it reopens so riders see the benefits and will support more lines undergoing similar treatments,\u201d Mr. Wright said.Denise Richardson, the executive director of the General Contractors Association of New York, an industry group representing contractors involved in public works projects, said more can get done if they are not trying to work piecemeal around existing service. When the Montague Street subway tunnel linking Brooklyn and Manhattan was shut down in 2013 for Sandy-related repairs, it reopened the next year \u2014 ahead of schedule and on budget, said Ms. Richardson, who is a member of the Regional Plan Association\u2019s board.\u201cWe saw a greater level of efficiency and ability to get projects done,\u201d she said.For riders, a dedicated subway corporation could bring faster relief from the constant delays and overstuffed subways.\u201cThe key to repairing the subway is creating a sense of urgency and accountability, not just for Governor Cuomo but also for the governors who come after him,\u201d said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The First Modern President", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In his measured, insightful biography, \u201cPresident McKinley: Architect of the American Century,\u201d Robert W. Merry seeks to set the record straight. He notes that the willful, flamboyant Roosevelt upstaged the staid, placid McKinley. Even Roosevelt\u2019s children joked that he wanted to be \u201cthe bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral,\u201d and Roosevelt was not above personal derision. When McKinley seemed to hesitate before declaring war on Spain in 1898, Roosevelt is said to have suggested, in a private remark that inevitably became public, that the president\u2019s backbone was \u201cas soft as a chocolate \u00e9clair.\u201d (The quip has also been attributed to House Speaker Thomas Reed.) In reality, Merry argues, McKinley was shrewd and patient, wily beneath the bland exterior.It is true that the idea of making the United States a global maritime power, a potential rival to Britain and its Royal Navy, was first pushed by Roosevelt and his friend Henry Cabot Lodge, a senator from Massachusetts, who coined the term \u201cthe large policy.\u201d Roosevelt wanted to make America a great conquering nation. In a particularly bellicose speech to the Naval War College in 1897, he used the word \u201cwar\u201d 62 times.McKinley disliked such swagger. Unlike Roosevelt, he had experienced combat as a young man. Serving as a quartermaster in the Civil War, McKinley had bravely, if unglamorously, driven a food wagon through heavy fire to deliver supplies to the troops at Antietam. Though he liked to be called \u201cthe Major,\u201d he did not boast of his wartime exploits, and at a reunion of old soldiers he once wisely observed, \u201cMy comrades, the memories of the war are sweeter than service in the war.\u201dAt the beginning of his administration, McKinley had been wary about making Roosevelt assistant secretary of the Navy, the job T.R. coveted as a platform to push for American sea power. \u201cI want peace,\u201d McKinley told a mutual acquaintance, \u201cand I am told that your friend Theodore \u2026 is always getting into rows with everybody.\u201d When Roosevelt, grudgingly elevated to the post by McKinley, and Senator Lodge began agitating for American intervention in Cuba\u2019s ongoing revolt against Spain, McKinley remarked, \u201cI have been through one war. I have seen the dead piled up; and I do not want to see another.\u201dNonetheless, McKinley saw that \u201cisolation is no longer possible or desirable\u201d for a rising industrial giant in a global economy. America needed new markets and protected trade routes. President McKinley told a friendly congressman, \u201cI suspect that Roosevelt is right, and the only difference between him and me is that mine is the greater responsibility.\u201d Merry persuasively contends that McKinley, working quietly and deliberately, through indirection rather than bombast, guided America not only to liberate Cuba from Spain but also to seize the Philippines and press American interests all the way to China. On a scrap of paper, McKinley wrote, \u201cWhile we are conducting war and until its conclusion, we must keep all we get; when the war is over we must keep what we want.\u201dMcKinley was not a tub-thumper for national grandeur. He spoke more idealistically about the need to \u201cuplift and civilize\u201d the Filipino people. Not unreasonably, he was attacked at the time by anti-imperialists like Mark Twain for hypocritically grabbing foreign lands while trying to sound like a good Christian. But as Merry notes, it was McKinley who first struck a balance between projecting power and serving humanitarian ends \u2014 between realism and idealism \u2014 that would become the guideposts of 20th-century American foreign policy.McKinley ended a period of congressional dominance and centralized federal power in the White House, and he transformed presidential politics by methodically building a national base by identifying voters for the Republican Party rather than simply relying on inspirational speeches.Clear and thoroughgoing, Merry\u2019s book is a deft character study of a president. It is also a brief for the slow-and-steady school of leadership, a subtle reminder that showboating moralizers can be balanced by grounded and wiser souls.Evan Thomas is the author of \u201cThe War Lovers\u201d and \u201cBeing Nixon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The party\u2019s central committee, Parliament and Mr. Mugabe\u2019s cabinet could now take steps to officially end his presidency, if he does not resign.The military arrested Mr. Mugabe early Wednesday, effectively ending his 37-year rule, although it allowed him to appear in public on Friday to address a university graduation.Later on Friday, party members endorsed the military\u2019s efforts to stabilize the economy and defuse political instability. They echoed military commanders in arguing that the intervention was aimed at rooting out a cabal of corrupt interlopers who had clouded Mr. Mugabe\u2019s judgment and his ability to govern.\u201cMany of us had watched with pain as the party and government were being reduced to the personal property of a few infiltrators with traitorous histories and questionable commitment to the people of Zimbabwe,\u201d the party leaders said in a resolution. \u201cClearly, the country was going down the wrong path.\u201dOver the past few days, the military has been in negotiations to find a peaceful and face-saving way for Mr. Mugabe to exit the scene, in talks mediated by South Africa and other countries in the region, and by the Roman Catholic Church.Mr. Mugabe, 93, has dominated his country since independence from Britain 37 years ago, surviving through a blend of political skill, brutality, manipulation and patronage dispensed among a corrupt elite.Those days \u201care numbered,\u201d though, said Chris Mutsvangwa, the leader of Zimbabwe\u2019s influential war veterans\u2019 movement, which was founded to represent those who fought in the seven-year liberation war in the 1970s but has emerged as a powerful political force.At a news conference, Mr. Mutsvangwa cranked up pressure on Mr. Mugabe, saying the longtime leader would face huge calls for his ouster at a rally on Saturday.At his news conference, Mr. Mutsvangwa said several key regions in Zimbabwe\u2019s Shona-speaking heartlands \u2014 the base of ZANU-PF\u2019s support \u2014 had approved calls for the president\u2019s expulsion. Mr. Mugabe himself has in the past used orchestrated maneuvering in the provinces to undermine national figures in Harare.The talks involving the Catholic Church and South African mediators are intended to devise some form of transition that would have the appearance of constitutional legitimacy while providing a decorous departure for a leader whose role in the pre-independence liberation struggle is central to the national narrative.The military\u2019s ultimate intention has apparently been to effect a transfer of power without the appearance of illegality that might draw further opprobrium from outside Zimbabwe or frighten off potential investors.\u201cThe army is trying to keep people guessing\u201d while talks continue, said Frank Chikowore, a Zimbabwean journalist.The ZANU-PF resolution on Friday singled out the G-40, a faction of politicians aligned with Mr. Mugabe\u2019s wife, Grace Mugabe. It denounced four of them as \u201ccriminals and counterrevolutionaries\u201d: Jonathan N. Moyo, the minister of higher education; Ignatius M. Chombo, the finance minister; Saviour Kasukuwere, minister for local government; and Patrick Zhuwao, the minister for public services, labor and social welfare.Outside the main cities on Friday, the military set up roadblocks on main highways, apparently to thwart any attempt at organized resistance. Buses traveling from Bulawayo, the second city, to Harare, the capital, were pulled over and boarded by soldiers who checked documents and asked passengers about their business. Sometimes, travelers reported, the soldiers ordered passengers off the buses for inspection. Some were asked if they were carrying weapons.Such was the official concern to maintain an appearance of normalcy that the state broadcaster devoted the first 10 minutes of its news bulletin on Thursday to interviews with people across the land and, as if scripted, all repeated the same refrain: \u201cIt\u2019s business as usual.\u201d Mr. Mugabe\u2019s appearance at the graduation ceremony \u2014 however surreal \u2014 seemed to be part of the same stratagem.Some Zimbabweans suggested that the officers\u2019 calculation might offer Mr. Mugabe a chance to play hardball in closed-door talks.In the annals of Africa\u2019s many uprisings and coups, the script often involves the strongman fleeing into exile or being imprisoned or even shot.Instead, Zimbabwe\u2019s military allowed Mr. Mugabe to return to State House, his official residence, and on Friday, he appeared in a bright blue cap and gown, under tight security, to oversee the graduation ceremony in Harare. At one point, he appeared to doze, his head lolling.By appearing at the ceremony, Mr. Mugabe wanted to give \u201cthe impression that he is still in charge,\u201d Mr. Mutsvangwa said. \u201cHe is finished.\u201d\u201cHe is defying the population, trying to give a semblance of normality when things are not normal,\u201d Mr. Mutsvangwa said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are saying: Don\u2019t lie to yourself; it\u2019s a delusion. You know he has been deluding himself \u2014 he is deluded.\u201dMr. Mugabe \u2014 in official portrayals at least \u2014 has maintained power as an enduring emblem of the fight to expunge colonial influence in Africa.But he has presided over a precipitous economic decline that began with the seizing of white-owned farms starting in 2000. Joblessness has soared, and a shortage of foreign currency has driven up the price of imports. At the same time, a loyal elite around him has amassed villas, farms and high-end automobiles.Jeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Alan Cowell from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Climate Risks We Face", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsSince the dawn of the industrial age, humans have been pumping increasing amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning coal, oil and gas. Researchers at the Mauna Loa Observatory, perched on the side of a volcano on Hawaii\u2019s Big Island, have measured atmospheric levels of this greenhouse gas since 1958. That first year, carbon dioxide averaged 316 parts per million. In May, it reached 410 p.p.m. \u2014 an amount never before experienced in the history of our species. This atmospheric carbon dioxide \u2014 as well as other heat-trapping gases and other air pollutants emitted by humans \u2014 is affecting our planet profoundly.The majority of the report\u2019s 51 authors were drawn from federal agencies, like NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Energy. Much of the foundational data and modeling that underpin the report rely on government investments in observational data and high-performance computing. The report was strengthened by an extensive review process involving the public, the National Academy of Sciences, and all relevant federal agencies, spanning two administrations.The report concludes that \u201cglobal climate continues to change rapidly compared to the pace of the natural variations in climate that have occurred throughout Earth\u2019s history.\u201d It finds that \u201chuman activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\u201d The bottom line is that this report confirms and strengthens what the vast majority of climate scientists have known for decades: that climate is changing and humans are primarily responsible.Recent observations and investment in modeling and research have only strengthened the quality and amount of evidence collected. As the report documents, each of the last three years has successively been the warmest on record based on observational data going back to the late 19th century, and 16 of the last 17 years have been among the 17 warmest years on record globally. Global sea level has risen by about 7 to 8 inches since 1900, with nearly half this rise occurring since 1993. A substantial component of this rise, which is accelerating the increased frequency of disruptive \u201cnuisance\u201d flooding in dozens of coastal American cities, is because of human activity. At the same time, the area of ocean covered by Arctic sea ice in September (the typical annual minimum) has decreased by about 50 percent, while its volume has decreased even more dramatically as the remaining ice thins.The report also highlights growing reasons for concern. For example, ocean acidification, which occurs when atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by seawater, is taking place at what is thought to be the fastest rate in at least 66 million years. Coupled with reductions in oxygen content in near-coastal American waters, this poses a significant threat to coastal fisheries and ecosystems. Much of the western United States is facing a growing threat of more severe drought and larger wildfires as higher temperatures, reduced snow pack and earlier spring snow melt reduce water availability during the warm season.To stabilize global temperature, net carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced to zero. The window of time is rapidly closing to reduce emissions and limit warming to no more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the goal set in the Paris climate accord. The further we push the climate system beyond historical conditions, the greater the risks of potentially unforeseen and even catastrophic changes to the climate \u2014 so every reduction in emissions helps.While climate models incorporate many important processes, they cannot include all aspects of the climate system and all of the possible interactions within that system. Vicious cycles between these climate components may push the Earth into states much different from the past: for example, one with a much smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet and much higher sea level, or one without coral reefs and with greatly reduced marine biodiversity. Surprises can also come from compound extreme events like droughts, floods, heat waves, hurricanes and wildfires that may occur in multiple places at the same time, or sequentially in one place. What is clear is that, even though we cannot quantify all of the possible changes to every element of the climate system, the risks to things we care about \u2014 from the health of our children, to the future economic viability of our low-lying coastal cities and infrastructure \u2014 are real and growing.And yet, there is also reason for optimism. The report documents how global carbon emissions may be leveling out, despite continued global economic growth. News reports in just this past year show how the cost of clean energy sources such as wind and solar have decreased dramatically both here and in emerging economies such as China, India and even the Middle East, sending powerful signals to long-term investors and businesses about which way things are trending. And more and more businesses, whether by choice or in response to investor demand, are asking: What risks do we face, if we do not plan for a changing climate?All humans share this planet. We depend on it for the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe, the natural resources it provides and the places where we live. For that reason, all Americans need to understand the risks we face, and the impact our choices will have on our future.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Is Ceding Global Leadership to China", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Amid the pomp that President Xi Jinping of China is bestowing upon his visiting American counterpart, President Trump, it\u2019s hard not to see two leaders \u2014 and two countries \u2014 heading in very different directions.Mr. Xi emerged from last month\u2019s Communist Party Congress the undisputed master of the Middle Kingdom. \u201cXi Jinping Thought\u201d was enshrined in the party constitution \u2014 an honor previously granted only to Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Breaking with precedent, Mr. Xi neglected to anoint a successor \u2014 a big hint that he feels emboldened to extend his rule beyond the second five-year term he has just begun. The Economist heralded Mr. Xi with an honorific usually reserved for America\u2019s president: the world\u2019s most powerful man.Mr. Trump stepped off Air Force One in Beijing on Wednesday with historically low job-approval ratings, just hours after suffering a shellacking in off-year elections. His credibility is cratering abroad \u2014 polls have shown a drop in confidence in American leadership.As the personal trajectories of Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi diverge, so too does the focus of their leadership. While Mr. Trump is obsessed with building walls, Mr. Xi is busy building bridges.At the World Economic Forum in January, Mr. Xi proclaimed China the new champion of free trade and globalization. His \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative \u2014 with funding from the made-in-Beijing Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank \u2014 will invest $1 trillion in linking Asia with Europe through a network of sea routes, roads, railways and, yes, bridges. China will gain access to resources, export its excess industrial capacity and peacefully secure strategic footholds from which to project power.While Mr. Trump shuns multilateralism and global governance, Mr. Xi increasingly embraces them.The Trump administration has belittled the United Nations, withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, jettisoned America\u2019s commitment to the Paris climate accord, tried to renege on the nuclear deal with Iran, questioned America\u2019s core alliances in Europe and Asia, disparaged the World Trade Organization and multicountry trade deals, and sought to shut the door on immigrants.Mr. Xi? He has grabbed leadership of the climate-change agenda, embraced the World Trade Organization\u2019s dispute-resolution system and increased China\u2019s voting shares at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Beijing is forging ahead with a trade pact that would include the major Asian economies plus Australia and New Zealand, but not the United States. China is now one of the leading contributors to the United Nations budget and peacekeeping operations. And Mr. Xi is making a determined play to attract the world\u2019s cutting-edge scientists and innovators to China.At home, Mr. Xi is making strategic investments that could allow China to dominate the 21st-century global economy, including in information technology and artificial intelligence \u2014 where, Eric Schmidt of Google has warned, China is poised to overtake the United States in the next decade. Mr. Xi is all-in on robotics, aerospace, high-speed rail, new-energy vehicles and advanced medical products.Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cstrategic\u201d investments \u2014 in coal and a quixotic effort to bring back manufacturing lost to automation \u2014 would make the United States the champion of the 20th-century economy.All of this positions China to become, in Mr. Xi\u2019s words, \u201ca new choice for other countries\u201d and the principal arbiter of something long associated with the United States: the international order. China has a profound stake in that order and a globalized world: It needs access to advanced technology and the export markets upon which its growth depends.The contradictions at the heart of China\u2019s enterprise could still prove to be its undoing. Beijing continues to fence off key sectors of its economy to foreign investment. It imposes draconian requirements on foreign companies \u2014 like requiring them to take on a Chinese partner and hand over their technology and intellectual property \u2014 that other countries do not impose on Chinese companies.Beijing\u2019s foreign investments can be coercive and exploitative \u2014 using Chinese laborers and contractors instead of local ones, saddling poorer countries with enormous debts, leaving behind shoddy workmanship and fueling corruption.Mr. Xi\u2019s ability to sustain the outward projection of Chinese influence is also challenged by his country\u2019s systemic weaknesses. A mountain of debt. Rising inequality. Slowing growth, dragged down by an aging population, lower productivity and inefficient state-owned enterprises. Poisonous air and scarce water. And an increasingly repressive system that may appeal to fellow authoritarians but not to Chinese citizens.But China\u2019s shortcomings may not matter in the absence of a compelling alternative. I\u2019d never bet against the United States, but if the Trump-led retreat into nationalism, protectionism, unilateralism and xenophobia continues, China\u2019s model could carry the day.The world is not self-organizing. And American stewardship of the international order advanced liberal values and progressive norms \u2014 democracy, human rights, freedom of speech and assembly, protections for workers, the environment and intellectual property. By abdicating the leadership role it has played since World War II, the United States is giving the terrain to others who will do the organizing on the basis of their values, not America\u2019s.Mr. Xi is not shy about who that someone else will be. With Mr. Trump ceding ground to China, the liberal international order that defined the second half of the 20th century could give way to an illiberal one.An earlier version of this article misidentified the the document that was revised to reflect President Xi Jinping\u2019s increased power. It was the Communist Party\u2019s constitution, not the country\u2019s.Antony J.

{"Headline": "Bill Signals Top Tax Priority of G.O.P. Is to Help Corporations", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 There are tough choices at the heart of the Republican tax bills speeding through Congress, and they make clear what the party values most in economic policy right now: deep and lasting tax cuts for corporations.The bill that sailed through the House on Thursday chooses to take from high-tax Democratic states, particularly California and New York, and give to lower-tax Republican states that President Trump carried in 2016, particularly Florida and Texas. It allows for tax increases on millions of families several years from now, if a future Congress does not intervene, but not for similar increases on corporations.A consistent conservative philosophy underpins all those decisions. So does a very large bet \u2014 economically and politically \u2014 on the power of business tax cuts to deliver rapid wage growth to United States workers.There is also the appearance, to liberal critics in particular, of Republicans seeking to reward their prized constituencies first, while leaving others to bear the consequences if their most optimistic scenarios do not play out.The Senate bill differed from the House version when it was introduced last week, and broke further away on Tuesday night, with a package of amendments that included repealing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that most individuals buy health insurance. To comply with procedural rules that would allow Republicans to pass the bill on a party-line vote in the Senate, the amendment also set an expiration date \u2014 Dec. 31, 2025 \u2014 on all the individual tax cuts in the legislation.In light of those changes, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation projected on Thursday that Americans earning $30,000 or less would see their taxes increase, as a group, beginning in 2021, if the Senate bill becomes law, apparently as a function of the mandate repeal driving fewer Americans to claim tax subsidies for insurance.The committee also projected that Americans earning $75,000 or below would face large tax increases in 2027, after the individual tax cuts expire. When only looking at individuals\u2019 tax bills \u2014 and not the effects of corporate taxes on individuals\u2019 incomes \u2014 the committee said Americans at all income levels would see tax increases in 2027, compared to what they would have been if the Senate bill had not passed.The House bill would raise personal taxes on Californians and New Yorkers by a combined $16 billion in 2027, Mr. Davis found, while cutting personal taxes on Texans and Floridians by more than $30 billion in total.His analysis finds so-called red states, which Mr. Trump carried in 2016, would receive more than twice as much in personal tax benefits under the plan than the blue states won by his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, when adjusting for the size of each state\u2019s economy. Only one red state \u2014 Utah \u2014 would receive lower personal tax benefits under the bill than would be expected, given how much it contributes to the national income; the average blue state, by contrast, would receive lower benefits than expected.\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for a tax bill to have varying impacts in different parts of the country,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cBut the degree to which this bill makes winners and losers out of different states is remarkable.\u201dCurtailing state and local deductions helps finance a core feature of both the House and Senate bills, which happens to be one of the few provisions Mr. Trump has called nonnegotiable in tax discussions: cutting the corporate income tax to a flat 20 percent rate, down from a top rate of 35 percent today. Republicans have kept those cuts permanent, even as the Senate applied an expiration date to the individual cuts and to a key tax credit for families preserved in the House bill. The Senate bill also sets an expiration date on breaks for so-called pass-through businesses, whose owners pay taxes on profits through the tax code for individuals.In Washington, Republicans have stressed that cutting corporate taxes will supercharge economic growth, accelerating job creation and raising wages in the process. By that theory, making such cuts permanent is essential.The gamble is apparent. Polls show that voters want corporations to pay higher, not lower, taxes and that they doubt corporate rate cuts will show up in their own paychecks, as the White House has claimed. Perhaps not coincidentally, Republican leaders have pitched their bills largely as middle-class tax cuts, stressing the benefits for the typical American family during television appearances and news conferences.\u201cThe policy expects that the corporate tax cuts will do the most for growth,\u201d said Lanhee J. Chen, a research fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, who was the policy director for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign in 2012. \u201cOn the other hand, they\u2019re the hardest to explain.\u201dRepublicans are \u201cmaking a choice as to which elements of their plan are permanent,\u201d said Jacob Leibenluft, a senior adviser at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic aide under President Barack Obama, \u201cand I think it\u2019s worth starting with taking them at face value.\u201dCanceling those looming increases would further add to the federal budget deficit, if the move is not paired with spending cuts. Middle-class families planning ahead can imagine two possible consequences from that decision: Either an immediate increase in their taxes eight years from now, or an explosion in federal budget deficits, which could necessitate spending cuts to safety net programs like Social Security and Medicare.\u201cThe bill reflects talking out of both sides of your mouth at the same time \u2014 neither of which is leading to good policy,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.Republican leaders in both chambers have said that they will not allow individual tax breaks to expire \u2014 and that their corporate cuts will yield enough growth and additional tax revenue to pay for themselves, or at least come close. Ms. MacGuineas and others fear the opposite could be even more likely: that growth will fall far short of those optimistic projections, and when the expiring tax provisions come up for reauthorization, budget deficits will be swelling. The result, they say, would be more hard choices \u2014 and predictable ones.An earlier version of this article misstated the expiration date of individual tax cuts proposed in the Senate tax overhaul plan. The cuts would expire on Dec. 31, 2025, not Dec 25, 2025.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will a Corporate Tax Cut Lift Worker Pay? A Union Wants It in Writing", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 At the heart of the Republican tax plan hurtling through Congress is an implicit promise that cutting corporate taxes will lift the middle class through higher wages and more jobs.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, for example, said in a recent speech that \u201cfixing the business side of our tax code is really all about helping families and workers,\u201d adding that \u201ccutting the corporate tax rate means more jobs here in the United States. It will foster increased competition, which will directly drive up wages for our workers.\u201dYet few American companies have offered specific plans that support those promises. While many chief executives broadly praise Republicans\u2019 efforts to cut taxes, few have detailed how they would deploy the savings from a corporate tax cut or put more money back in workers\u2019 pockets.The lack of pledges to create jobs has not been lost on President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, who seemed perplexed last week about the lack of corporate enthusiasm for a tax cut.At a Wall Street Journal conference, Mr. Cohn asked his audience of chief executives how many of them would invest more if the tax cut were passed. When only a few attendees raised their hands, Mr. Cohn asked: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the other hands up?\u201dLabor groups are wondering the same thing \u2014 and are seizing on the administration\u2019s economic analysis that the tax cut will translate into an extra $4,000 in take-home pay for workers.This week, the Communications Workers of America asked several companies that employ its members to promise to give workers a pay increase if the cut in the corporate tax rate goes through. The request, while unlikely to be heeded, highlights a critical question over who would benefit the most from the tax bill: shareholders or workers?\u201cPresident Trump and the Republican Congress have been trying to sell this corporate tax cut to working families by making big claims about wage increases, investment and job growth that don\u2019t seem to be supported by the evidence,\u201d said Chris Shelton, the president of the union. \u201cWe\u2019re going straight to the people who know how corporations plan to spend the billions of dollars being handed over to them \u2014 the C.E.O.s \u2014 and asking them if they intend to keep the promises that Trump is making on their behalf.\u201dJamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase and chairman of the Business Roundtable, told the Economic Club of Chicago this week that if Congress had already passed a tax overhaul bill, \u201csome companies would have made huge investments.\u201d\u201cWe know one thing for sure: Investments drive productivity, drives jobs and wages,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump has put a number on it, saying a typical American would see a $4,000 raise if the corporate rate was reduced to 20 percent from a high of 35 percent today, as both the House-passed bill and the pending Senate version propose. His Council of Economic Advisers says the increase could go as high as $9,000 for the average household.President Trump\u2019s top economist, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said last week that he expected corporations to invest heavily and raise workers\u2019 wages if the tax bill became law. When most developed nations have cut their corporate tax rate, he said, the resulting wage increases were \u201cwell north\u201d of $4,000 per year for workers.But Democrats and liberal economists dispute those claims, citing research that suggests that the bulk of the benefits from corporate cuts will flow to the rich, partly through companies\u2019 buying back stock or increasing dividend payments to shareholders.The companies largely declined to comment or dismissed the letter as a stunt.Jim Gerace, chief communications officer for Verizon, said that the company would take up the wage issue with the union when contract negotiations begin in 2019, \u201cregardless of the outcome of tax reform legislation,\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s just too early to speak to the impacts on our business\u201d from the tax bill.AT&T \u2014 which has promised to invest an additional $1 billion in the United States if the tax bill passes, a rare level of detail for a corporation \u2014 issued a statement that noted: \u201cWe\u2019ve said that with the passage of a tax bill that includes a permanent corporate tax rate of 20 percent, we\u2019ll increase our investment in the United States. Research tells us that each $1 billion invested in the telecom sector creates about 7,000 jobs, which means 7,000 new wage earners.\u201dIt is possible that a tax cut could increase wages even if companies do not intend it to, particularly in the current economic environment, where unemployment is hovering just above 4 percent. Most economists consider that rate to be an indication that the economy is running close to full capacity. As companies compete more to hire individual workers, they should be able to bargain for higher wages.Administration officials appear to believe that individual companies are reluctant to describe how they would use the proceeds from a tax cut to invest and hire workers, despite their lobbying groups\u2019 aggressive promotion of the job-creation benefits of the bill.\u201cMy guess is, if I\u2019m a Fortune 500 C.E.O., I\u2019m not going to tell my competitors, who are sitting in the aisle next to me, what I\u2019m going to do next year,\u201d the White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday morning. \u201cThey\u2019re going to do what\u2019s in their best interest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But as appealing as it may be to skip the doughnut and lose a little weight, the disappearing spare can cause headaches: AAA said that last year it had answered roadside assistance calls from 450,000 members whose cars did not have spares \u2014 a situation that can mean a trip to the repair shop on a flatbed.The freedom to eliminate spare tires altogether is largely possible as a result of developments in tire construction technology.An increasingly popular alternative to spares is the so-called run-flat design, which most new BMW models use. Intended to make roadside tire changes unnecessary, this solution employs a reinforced tire sidewall that typically lets the driver continue for 50 miles at up to 50 miles an hour after air pressure is lost. But they can be more costly: It may be necessary to replace, rather than simply patch, a damaged tire, and replacements are typically priced $25 to $50 higher than a conventional design.Another alternative is the self-sealing tire, an older solution reappearing in modern form on the battery-powered Chevrolet Bolt, where reduced weight translates to more miles per charge. Designed solely as an electric vehicle, the Bolt has no provision for carrying a spare. According to Michelin, which supplies the Bolt\u2019s Energy Saver A/S Selfseal rubber, the extra cost of a self-sealing tire \u2014 which can continue down the road even with a nail in the tread \u2014 is about $33 compared with conventional tires of the same size.But some models are losing the spare without the benefit of run-flat or self-sealing rubber, instead including conventional tires and a leak repair kit \u2014 packaged in an aerosol can or used in conjunction with a small air compressor powered by the car\u2019s battery.Such kits skim weight while skipping the tire, but have limited abilities to deal with any road hazard more serious than a nail hole in the tire\u2019s tread section. A larger tear in the tire \u2014 something that can happen when modern low-profile tires meet a pothole \u2014 or damage to the sidewall or wheel rim will not be fixed by a leak kit. The sealants, which are usually one-time use devices, have a finite shelf life \u2014 usually from four to eight years, AAA said \u2014 and cost about $40 to replace.Even if a leak sealant kit gets you back on the road in a hurry after a minor puncture, it could complicate a permanent repair. Affixing an internal patch after a sealant has been used requires a thorough cleanup of all the goo inside, said Tom Carter, technical communications director for Michelin.For a car owner \u2014 and certainly renters who might not know what they are getting into \u2014 the best way to prevent an unpleasant middle-of-the-night surprise is to check for a spare and be sure that it holds air. If there\u2019s a sealant kit instead, read the owner\u2019s manual (which may be on a DVD or available on the car\u2019s display screen) and learn how to use it.In some cases, greater peace of mind is available from the automakers.For instance, although mainstream versions of the 2017 Honda Civic come from the factory with space-saver spares, the Civic Si does not. A spare wheel kit, including a jack and tools, is available from Honda dealers as an accessory for the Civic Si at a suggested retail price of $254. The tire, which must be purchased separately, runs about $115 from sources like Tirerack.com.BMW offers a compact spare kit \u2014 including jack and wrench \u2014 for many of its X Series sport utility vehicles and for the 5 and 7 Series sedans. In most cases, it\u2019s a $150 option when ordering the car, though on some models with conventional tires it is free. On the sport utility models, the compact spare fits entirely within a compartment under the rear floor, but on the sedans it juts out too high, meaning the floor panel cannot lie flat.Not surprisingly, independent online retailers have also emerged to fill the hole. Buyers should make sure to compare prices with the dealership and to determine that there is a storage spot in the car where the tire can be secured. As designers work to smooth airflow under the car for fuel-economy improvements, those compartments are going away, too.The disappearance of the spare tire might be more than just an exercise in efficiency. It may be a sociological statement. A survey by AAA found that some 20 percent of drivers do not know how to change a flat tire, and with the rise of roadside assistance coverage for new cars, that number is unlikely to shrink.The era of cars proudly displaying a spare tire mounted on the front fender or rear bumper \u2014 a standby of prewar classics \u2014 is long gone, and the tradition of suburban dads gathering to inspect a neighbor\u2019s new purchase may have to undergo a major change.Instead of crowding around the front end to see what\u2019s under the hood, perhaps they\u2019ll be checking the trunk to see if it\u2019s got a spare.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Generation in Japan Faces a Lonely Death", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKIWADAIRA, Japan \u2014 Cicadas, every Japanese schoolchild knows, lie underground for years before rising to the earth\u2019s surface in summer. They climb up the nearest tree, where they cast off their shells and start their short second lives. During their few days among us, they mate, fly and cry. They cry until their bodies are found on the ground, twitching in their last moments, or on their backs with their legs pointing upward.Chieko Ito hated the din they made. They had just started shrieking, as they always did in early summer, and the noise would keep getting louder in the weeks to come, invading her third-floor apartment, making any kind of silence impossible. As one species of cicadas quieted down, another\u2019s distinct cry would take over. Then, as the insects peaked in numbers, showers of dead and dying cicadas would rain down on her enormous housing complex, stopping only with the end of summer itself.\u201cYou hear them from morning to evening,\u201d she sighed.It was the afternoon of her 91st birthday, and unusually hot, part of a heat wave that had community leaders worried. Elderly volunteers had been winding through the labyrinth of footpaths, distributing leaflets on the dangers of heatstroke to the many hundreds of residents like Mrs. Ito who lived alone in 171 nearly identical white buildings. With no families or visitors to speak of, many older tenants spent weeks or months cocooned in their small apartments, offering little hint of their existence to the world outside their doors. And each year, some of them died without anyone knowing, only to be discovered after their neighbors caught the smell.The first time it happened, or at least the first time it drew national attention, the corpse of a 69-year-old man living near Mrs. Ito had been lying on the floor for three years, without anyone noticing his absence. His monthly rent and utilities had been withdrawn automatically from his bank account. Finally, after his savings were depleted in 2000, the authorities came to the apartment and found his skeleton near the kitchen, its flesh picked clean by maggots and beetles, just a few feet away from his next-door neighbors.The huge government apartment complex where Mrs. Ito has lived for nearly 60 years \u2014 one of the biggest in Japan, a monument to the nation\u2019s postwar baby boom and aspirations for a modern, American way of life \u2014 suddenly became known for something else entirely: the \u201clonely deaths\u201d of the world\u2019s most rapidly aging society.\u201c4,000 lonely deaths a week,\u201d estimated the cover of a popular weekly magazine this summer, capturing the national alarm.To many residents in Mrs. Ito\u2019s complex, the deaths were the natural and frightening conclusion of Japan\u2019s journey since the 1960s. A single-minded focus on economic growth, followed by painful economic stagnation over the past generation, had frayed families and communities, leaving them trapped in a demographic crucible of increasing age and declining births. The extreme isolation of elderly Japanese is so common that an entire industry has emerged around it, specializing in cleaning out apartments where decomposing remains are found.\u201cThe way we die is a mirror of the way we live,\u201d said Takumi Nakazawa, 83, the chairman of the resident council at Mrs. Ito\u2019s housing complex for the past 32 years.Summer was the most dangerous season for these lonely deaths, and Mrs. Ito wasn\u2019t taking any chances. Birthday or not, she knew that no one would call, drop a note or stop by to check on her. Born in the last year of the reign of Emperor Taisho, she never expected to live this long. One by one, family and friends had vanished or grown feeble. Ghosts, of the living and dead, now dwelled all around her in the scores of uniform buildings she and her husband had rushed to in 1960, when all of Japan seemed young.\u201cNow every room is mine, and I can do as I please,\u201d Mrs. Ito said. \u201cBut it\u2019s no good.\u201dShe had been lonely every day for the past quarter of a century, she said, ever since her daughter and husband had died of cancer, three months apart. Mrs. Ito still had a stepdaughter, but they had grown apart over the decades, exchanging New Year\u2019s cards or occasional greetings on holidays.So Mrs. Ito asked a neighbor in the opposite building for a favor. Could she, once a day, look across the greenery separating their apartments and gaze up at Mrs. Ito\u2019s window?Every evening around 6 p.m., before retiring for the night, Mrs. Ito closed the paper screen in the window. Then in the morning, after her alarm woke her at 5:40 a.m., she slid the screen back open.\u201cIf it\u2019s closed,\u201d Mrs. Ito told her neighbor, \u201cit means I\u2019ve died.\u201dMrs. Ito felt reassured when the neighbor agreed, so she began sending the woman gifts of pears every summer to occasionally glance her way.If her neighbor happened to notice the paper screen in daylight, the woman could promptly alert the authorities. Everything else had been thought out and taken care of in advance. On her 90th birthday, Mrs. Ito had filled out an \u201cending note\u201d that organized her final affairs. The notes, which have become popular in Japan, help ensure a clean, orderly death. Mrs. Ito had also given away the tablets from the family\u2019s Buddhist altar \u2014 the miniature headstones considered so precious that many Japanese would scoop them up before running out of a house on fire.So many things in her apartment now reminded her of the dead. There were the paperbacks, hundreds of them jammed onto shelves, that her dying husband had told her to throw away after reading. The finely carved chest of drawers, which her daughter had carted away after getting married, sat there, too, returned decades ago when the young woman died. Tucked inside a cabinet were the books that Mrs. Ito had written herself, including a dry but exhaustive two-volume book about her life in the housing complex and a 224-page autobiography, all finished in a final burst of activity.Mrs. Ito, meticulous as ever, had even left behind money to clean out her home once the day arrived. The only thing left to do was to wipe away the red coloring from her name, already engraved on the family headstone, to signify that she had finally joined her husband and daughter.\u201cEverybody around me has died, one after another, and I\u2019m the only one left,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I think about death, I\u2019m afraid.\u201dThe heat soon started taking its toll. By midsummer, two bodies were discovered in the complex \u2014 victims, it seemed, of the early heat wave. The first death occurred in Mrs. Ito\u2019s section, where a woman detected the smell from the apartment below. Initially, she thought somebody had gotten a delivery of dried fish called kusaya. Then the stench intensified, especially on the balcony where she hung her laundry. None of the dead man\u2019s neighbors knew him, though he had lived there for years. He was 67.The second man\u2019s body was found two days later. Again, the smell had become so intense that it had kept his next-door neighbor awake for three nights. The man was elderly, had lived there for years, and chatted about the cherry blossoms with his neighbors, but they didn\u2019t know his name. The inside of his apartment, visible through a small ventilation window, was covered in trash. Green bottle flies hovered around the vent.The building management tried to contain the smell, taping over every crevice \u2014 the edges of the men\u2019s front doors, their letter flaps, even the locks. It was futile. The stench seeped out, filling hallways, stairways and homes.Mrs. Ito kept busy, trying not to think about it. She took long walks outside the complex, which stretches across a Tokyo suburb for more than a mile, spreading out in the shape of a giant fan. She kept track of her steps on her cellphone, spent an hour every morning writing Buddhist sutras to her daughter and husband, and helped keep local forests clean with a volunteer group.Every month, she attended the lunches that residents organized to keep the isolation at bay and reduce the risk of lonely deaths. At the gatherings, she had settled into a routine, always sitting at a table across from a man with wobbly legs and a big appetite, Yoshikazu Kinoshita. The two could hardly have been more different \u2014 her days were organized to the minute; he got out of bed only when he felt like it. But their conversations, which some might have dismissed as small talk, had acquired deep meaning.\u201cThat\u2019s the way I manage,\u201d she said of her activities.She spoke rapidly, in long sentences, with an unusual directness for someone of her generation. Even in uncomfortable moments, she never sought refuge in the vagueness of the Japanese language. For the rare occasions that words failed her, she kept voluminous proof of the life she had lived, cataloged exhaustively by year and subject. The photo books in her apartment were filled with black-and-white images of young families like hers. And bound in yellow covers, with titles in Mrs. Ito\u2019s elegant calligraphy, were the books she had written, including the two-volume collection on her life in the housing complex: Tokiwadaira.In the 1960s, the Japanese government built huge housing developments outside Tokyo and other cities, each holding thousands of young \u201csalarymen\u201d entrusted with rebuilding Japan\u2019s postwar economy. The complexes \u2014 sprawling collections of buildings called danchi \u2014 introduced Japan to a Western structure of life centered on the nuclear family, breaking from the traditional multigenerational homes. The new apartments, seen as essential to Japan\u2019s rebirth, had strict requirements. The monthly wages of tenants in Tokiwadaira had to be at least 5.5 times the rent, ensuring that only the most successful people got in.Mrs. Ito\u2019s husband, Eizo, worked at a top advertising agency. But competition to enter one of the danchi was so fierce that the couple had given up after 13 tries. Then a relative secretly submitted an application in their name for a place still under construction, on farmland an hour east of Tokyo.Even before Shinto priests purified the soil and construction workers broke ground, Tokiwadaira was already drawing interest nationwide. The Japanese had never seen anything quite like it: around 4,800 apartments devouring a space so large that it was serviced by two train stations on the same line.The Itos arrived in mid-December 1960, on the very first day that tenants were allowed in. It was a clear day, full of promise, with Mount Fuji visible in the distance from their third-floor balcony. Her 4-year-old stepdaughter, Mrs. Ito wrote in her autobiography, was \u201cso happy that she ran around the apartment, drawing a complaint from their second-floor neighbor.\u201dTheir new home was called a \u201c3K\u201d \u2014 three small rooms and a kitchen, with a bathroom and toilet. What struck Mrs. Ito wasn\u2019t only the modern efficiency of the place, the concrete sturdiness that seemed capable of withstanding the strongest earthquakes, or the sun that came into every room. Peeking into the kitchen for the first time, she found the item that had, perhaps more than anything else, caused housewives to dream of life in the danchi: a sink, no longer made of tiles, but of sparkling stainless steel.Her kitchen stood in the center of the apartment, not in a dark corner at the back of the house as in old Japanese homes. The kitchen\u2019s centrality spoke of the new, elevated role of housewives. Like other privileged residents of the danchi, Mrs. Ito soon enjoyed the newest home appliances \u2014 a refrigerator, a washing machine and a black-and-white television set.\u201cWe called them the Three Sacred Treasures,\u201d Mrs. Ito said. The term, popular back then, was the burgeoning consumer society\u2019s reinterpretation of the Three Sacred Treasures in Japan\u2019s imperial mythology: the sword, the mirror and the jewel.\u201cWe were happy,\u201d Mrs. Ito said.After Mrs. Ito gave birth to a daughter a couple of years later, everything was settled. Her husband rode the packed train six days a week to Tokyo. She taught at a nursery school inside the complex, in charge of the Tulip Group. The danchi\u2019s population of children swelled, just as it did all over Japan. In a few years, there were so many children that they collectively became known as Japan\u2019s Second Baby Boom generation.Every New Year, the family put on their kimonos for photos. They also took part in the annual sports days, a ritual of Japanese life in which children and parents compete in races and other events. In the summer, Mrs. Ito took her daughters to one of the danchi\u2019s wading pools. In her photos, the pool is always full of water, always full of young mothers in modest one-piece bathing suits, always full of children. The housing complex even had its own song: \u201cBurning with hope, full of health and strength, let\u2019s rise all of us.\u201dMrs. Ito used to stand at her window, the one with the paper screen, and look down at the playground and sandboxes below. The children of the nearby buildings played there together, their shouts loudest during the summer. Now, no one played there. The children had mostly vanished, their jubilant cries replaced by the frequent annoying sirens of ambulances.The fading danchi are no longer a symbol of the young families rebuilding Japan. Nearly half of Tokiwadaira\u2019s residents are over 65. During a midsummer walk, Mrs. Ito pointed to the pool captured in her pictures decades ago. It was empty: a large circle, with fallen twigs and dirt littering its faded pale blue bottom.\u201cThis is the pool, where my children used to swim,\u201d Mrs. Ito said, suddenly growing quiet.She stood in the deserted playground, slowly taking in a place that, to her, seemed more real in her photos than in the present day.\u201cIt\u2019s gone!\u201d she said after a few seconds. \u201cThere was a jungle gym here before. I used to let them play on it. Now it\u2019s gone. So many things are.\u201dWhen I first met Mrs. Ito, it barely occurred to me that no one else had called or visited that afternoon. Only weeks later did she tell me \u2014 excitedly, as if she had been waiting for me to ask \u2014 that her birthday had fallen on the day of my first visit.Instead, she had simply handed me her book: \u201cChieko\u2019s 53 years in Tokiwadaira danchi.\u201d It was an encyclopedia of dates, names, events and photos spanning 394 pages. No one else had read it, and it wasn\u2019t clear then, even to her, why she had gone through the considerable trouble of composing drafts in longhand, typing it up on her laptop and printing it out.\u201cWriting is such a hassle, so it\u2019s strange, this need to write,\u201d she said.She was born into a family of storytellers. Her paternal great-grandfather was a celebrated professional narrator who traveled around the country, recounting episodes from Japan\u2019s feudal history. He was known by the stage name Hogyusha Torin, and his works survive in the national library. Her grandfather, also a professional storyteller, lived with Mrs. Ito when she was a child. He would sit at her desk, marking up his texts and binding the folding fan that he used during his performances.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s in my blood,\u201d Mrs. Ito said.In her book, Mrs. Ito broke her life in the danchi into two distinct parts. The first begins with her wedding and ends 32 years later with the deaths of her husband and daughter.She gave the impression that her life \u2014 her true life \u2014 had ended with theirs, especially her daughter, of whom she often spoke in the present tense. Sometimes she would tell a joke or show a flash of anger at the mention of her daughter\u2019s death. More often, she stared straight ahead.Part two \u2014 subtitled \u201cMy Second Life\u201d \u2014 focuses on friends, trips and goings on around the housing complex. Old friendships are renewed and new ones are made, though Mrs. Ito outlives them all.As the weeks passed and the cicadas\u2019 incessant cries became the backdrop to every conversation, Mrs. Ito ultimately concluded that she had started writing to break the solitude, so she wouldn\u2019t forget. \u201cEven the unhappy events,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise, everything is lost forever.\u201dAfter her husband and daughter died in 1992, Mrs. Ito\u2019s \u201cSecond Life\u201d began. By then, Tokiwadaira and Japan\u2019s other danchi had lost much of their luster. Families preferred living in houses or condominiums. Aging childless couples and individuals gravitated to Tokiwadaira.One of Mrs. Ito\u2019s closest friends moved in after becoming a widow. They ran into each other at the local supermarket\u2019s frozen foods section, so glad for the company that neither complained about the cold. \u201cAfter that we became inseparable \u2014 that\u2019s just the way I am,\u201d Mrs. Ito said.Years passed. The woman died, as did other friends, inside and outside the danchi. Her sister developed dementia. A brother became homebound. Even a younger brother now had trouble walking.\u201cI\u2019ve been lonely for 25 years,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones to blame for dying. I\u2019m angry.\u201dAt the monthly lunch for tenants who live alone, Mrs. Ito, a light eater, got into the habit of giving her tablemate, Mr. Kinoshita, half of her meal before she started. After learning that he liked reading, she lent him a few books. He began lending her some, and included some chocolate.Once, he asked her to come to his place to retrieve a book.\u201cThat\u2019s when I found out that his place was full of garbage.\u201dMr. Kinoshita lived in a ground-floor \u201c2DK\u201d apartment \u2014 two rooms and a dine-in kitchen. Piles of old clothes, boxes, books, newspapers, empty food containers and heaps of trash blanketed the floor. A single open trail led from the bed to the toilet, passing by the only clean item in the apartment: a white T-shirt hanging from a shelf, still wrapped in the dry cleaner\u2019s plastic.Mr. Kinoshita was 83. His legs had grown weak. He used a \u201csilver chair\u201d that he rolled in front of him to steady himself. He left his apartment perhaps once a week.After Mrs. Ito saw the state of his apartment, she alerted community leaders. Men who lived alone in the danchi, weakened by age and infirmity in apartments like that, were the most vulnerable. She learned that volunteers were already keeping an eye on him.Months ago, after he had not been seen for a week, a volunteer went knocking on his door. There was no answer, but she could hear the television from inside. Thinking he was dead, the volunteer called the police. When Mr. Kinoshita finally woke up from a deep sleep, he was a little embarrassed, yet also relieved and maybe even a little happy that his existence had figured into someone\u2019s thoughts.\u201cThanks for your kindness,\u201d Mr. Kinoshita liked to say in English, perhaps avoiding sentiments that were too hard to express in Japanese.He had left Tokyo in his late 60s and moved into Tokiwadaira 14 years ago, just as the lonely deaths were becoming common. The year he moved in, Tokiwadaira recorded 15 of them. Today, volunteers have managed to reduce them to about 10 a year.Mr. Kinoshita had lost everything before coming to the danchi. He had lost his company to bankruptcy and also the money he had borrowed from his sisters and brothers, who told him, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s ruined the Kinoshita clan.\u201d He had lost his house, and his second wife, who told him, \u201cThere\u2019s no use staying with a husband who\u2019d sell away our house.\u201dIt would have been easy to see Mr. Kinoshita as just another victim of the collapse of Japan\u2019s economic bubble. His company, I Love Industry, which worked as a subcontractor on underground construction projects \u2014 the \u201ctail of a mouse,\u201d he said \u2014 had ridden the country\u2019s construction boom from the 1960s through the 1990s until public works contracts dried up.Yet he had also enjoyed a moment of glory, one that he clung to the way Mrs. Ito clung to the Tokiwadaira in her books. During the construction of the Channel Tunnel, he had supplied a major contractor, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, with equipment \u2014 a reel for a hose \u2014 to help bore under the Strait of Dover.Mr. Kinoshita\u2019s large eyes lit up as he brought out his old business card, sketches of the equipment he had provided and photos of himself in his heyday: at a celebration at Kawasaki\u2019s headquarters; on site under the Dover Strait; visiting tourist attractions in Paris during his sole visit to Europe.There were talismans \u2014 a Eurotunnel key holder, which he held between his fingers and showed people, without ever letting go, as if he were afraid of losing it. He had commemorative medals of the tunnel\u2019s construction, a rock fragment encased in plastic, and the T-shirt carefully preserved in dry-cleaning wrap. It had a blue and red circle with \u201cEuro Tunnel\u201d inside.From his foray in Europe, he had brought back a habit of sprinkling some French words into his speech, on top of the broken English he had picked up decades earlier from a college friend.\u201cAll over Paris, I kept hearing, \u2018Merci madame,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to go back to Tokyo and say, \u2018Merci madame.\u2019 \u201dMr. Kinoshita took out a large black-and-white shot of himself in his 20s, working in a rice warehouse. Wearing only a loincloth that emphasized his sinewy frame and rodlike legs, he carried three rice bags on his shoulders, totaling 400 pounds. \u201cWhen I was young,\u201d he said in English.He was born in Taiwan, part of Japan\u2019s colonial empire back then. His family returned after World War II to southwestern Japan, where he ate the frogs he caught in rice fields. Even in the family\u2019s poverty and his nation\u2019s defeat, the adolescent Kinoshita caught glimpses of a bright future in Japan\u2019s energy and youth.\u201cMy generation had dreams,\u201d said Mr. Kinoshita, who went on to study mechanical engineering.He had never imagined that his decline \u2014 and Japan\u2019s \u2014 could be so rapid. Corporate giants like Sharp were now being taken over by a company in Taiwan, Japan\u2019s former colony, he said with bewilderment. In 2011, when Japan was hit by a terrible earthquake and tsunami, Mr. Kinoshita rose to his feet and steadied a cabinet from toppling over. Since then, the same legs that had supported the bags of rice could barely uphold his shrinking body.The world he knew had shrunk. He went to a health club until last year. Sitting in the Jacuzzi helped his legs, and he liked it when women came into the tub. But one day he passed out in the Jacuzzi and an ambulance was called. He came to, refused to get into the ambulance, and never returned to the health club. Now, he went out only a few times a month \u2014 to the supermarket, or to the monthly lunches where he shared a table with Mrs. Ito.His friendship with \u201cMadame Ito\u201d gave him energy, though she was the one who did most of the talking. \u201cShe\u2019s very assertive, to the point where I can\u2019t get a word in,\u201d he said.He was touched that she gave him half of her lunch, and that she lent him books, though he had racier tastes. \u201cI tend to prefer erotic books,\u201d he said.On a rare trip outside Tokiwadaira, Mr. Kinoshita took the train to Tokyo. He brought back Hershey\u2019s chocolate bars for Mrs. Ito and for the volunteer who had come knocking on his door. Mr. Kinoshita called her \u201cMadame Eleven.\u201dHe was hoping to make copies of his Eurotunnel T-shirt for Madame Ito and Madame Eleven. He had bought a dozen during his trip to Europe, but the one in the dry-cleaning wrap was his last.On July 24, the monthly anniversary of her daughter\u2019s death, Mrs. Ito left her apartment early in the morning to visit the grave, following the same path she had taken for the past quarter-century. Tall and long-limbed for someone of her generation, she walked with a straight back, maintaining the posture of someone much younger. Wearing jeans and sneakers, she headed up a narrow sidewalk, nearly touching the cars stuck in morning traffic beside her.The annual Obon festival of the dead was just a few weeks away, so Mrs. Ito also dropped by a local pear farmer and ordered midsummer fruit to be sent to her brothers and others, including the neighbor who looked up at the paper screen in her window.She had never failed to visit the graves, even on cold winter mornings. But she had made a few concessions for age, visiting her husband and daughter twice a month until she turned 85, then once a month after that. She brought food, eating it next to her daughter. She spoke to her, recounting the events since her last visit. The cemetery was always quiet, except in summer when the cicadas appeared.\u201cI don\u2019t tell her anything that might cause her to worry \u2014 I\u2019ll never tell her any problems I might have,\u201d Mrs. Ito said.She picked up a bucket and filled it with water. With a white cloth, she gently washed her daughter\u2019s black headstone. It rose nearly as tall as Mrs. Ito herself, who had lost more than two inches of her height to age.\u201cI can\u2019t reach the back, so I do only the front,\u201d she said, laughing.She arranged the flowers she had brought, including lilies, her daughter\u2019s favorite. She always avoided chrysanthemums. They were associated with death in Japan, and her daughter disliked them, anyway. She lit some sticks of incense, closed her eyes, put her hands together and bowed her head.Speaking to her daughter and husband, Mrs. Ito believed, had kept her healthy. \u201cAt this age, usually, you can\u2019t hear or see anymore, or you\u2019ve lost your teeth. Everything. I think they\u2019ve protected me.\u201dThis belief \u2014 that the spirits of the dead remain part of the lives of the living \u2014 was rooted in the Buddhism that guides the Japanese on matters of death. Maintaining that link came by taking care of the family grave. But in an aging society with fewer children, the difficulty of the task has become a daily topic of conversation. \u201cWhat do we do with our graves?\u201d asked the same weekly magazine that tapped into the national anxiety over lonely deaths.Some plots in the same row as Mrs. Ito\u2019s daughter were showing the neglect: weeds growing out of crevices, threatening to invade headstones. Entire areas hidden under overgrown plants and small trees, covering the names of the dead. They were like the aging villages across Japan that, after the last inhabitants became too feeble or died, were being reclaimed by nature.Mrs. Ito\u2019s daughter, Chizuko, had died at the age of 29. She had long been sickly, but when she died, Mrs. Ito waited outside the crematory as her husband went in.\u201cI just couldn\u2019t watch my own daughter being put into the fire,\u201d Mrs. Ito said.It was her daughter\u2019s death that had left her truly alone. If her daughter were alive, she would not have to ask her neighbor to watch the paper screen in her window. She wouldn\u2019t have to send the pears every summer.\u201cIf this child were here now,\u201d she said, \u201cthere would be nothing to worry about.\u201dIn keeping with Japanese custom, the dead often receive Buddhist names, which are engraved on their headstones. Once delivered from this world, they move on to the next, bearing new names as Buddhas themselves. That way, they will not mistakenly return to this world if the living happened to call them by their old names.Mrs. Ito\u2019s daughter, though, did not have a posthumous Buddhist name. The engraving on the headstone read: \u201cAccording to the wishes of the deceased, she has become a flower and rests here.\u201dSitting in Mrs. Ito\u2019s apartment, I remembered that she had mentioned a collection of photo albums of her balcony. I asked to see it, and she immediately pulled out 11 slim albums cataloged with her typical precision.I had expected balcony photos similar to those in her other collections: her young daughters sitting in an inflatable pool; or the portrait of her husband shown at his funeral, of him standing on the balcony on a rare snowy day.But the photos in these albums were all of flowers, flowers that Mrs. Ito had kept on her balcony since her daughter\u2019s death \u2014 amaryllises, geraniums, carnations, roses, morning glories, narcissuses, marigolds, every flower, it seemed, with the exception of chrysanthemums.\u201cI wonder,\u201d she said earnestly, \u201cwhy I took so many.\u201dTo community leaders in the danchi, the powerful odors coming from the apartments of men like Mr. Kinoshita \u2014 of sweat, urine, stale food and garbage \u2014 were the reassuring smell of life. When that came out of the letter flap of an apartment, they knew no one was dead inside. It was, perhaps more precisely, the smell of somebody clinging to life, which Mr. Kinoshita carried with him whenever he went outside.But as his legs weakened further, Mr. Kinoshita\u2019s world shrank to the confines of his apartment. Then, as the garbage piled up, his apartment shrank to his bed, where he sat or lay during the midsummer weeks, usually dressed only in a loin cloth.He had given up trying to clean. A social worker had visited this year, carting away a drafting machine used to design equipment for the Eurotunnel. But the garbage piled up again. When a cold kept him indoors over the summer, maggots appeared inside a bowl of unfinished instant curry on the floor.The midsummer cries of the cicadas \u2014 \u201cmeeen, meeen, meeen\u201d \u2014 echoed inside his apartment. Though they annoyed Mrs. Ito, they appealed to Mr. Kinoshita\u2019s sense of the ephemeral.\u201cThey cry desperately, they continue to cry as long as they\u2019re alive,\u201d Mr. Kinoshita said.His favorite were the cicadas that appeared in late summer every year, singing \u201ctsuku-tsuku boshi\u201d and signaling the coming change in seasons. His eyes bulged with excitement when he heard them for the first time outside his window.He was still a man of appetites, whether it was the lunch he accepted from Mrs. Ito, or the memory of intimacy. \u201cWhen I was young,\u201d he said.One evening, while sitting on his bed, he put in his dentures and slipped on the shorts and shirt he wore when he left home. He was headed to a monthly music performance he regularly attended at a computer repair shop. It was the only event marked on his wall calendar that month.At the shop, a singer began performing jazz standards. Her flirtatious voice and comments elicited small grunts of appreciation from Mr. Kinoshita. He tapped his fingers to the music.During a break, the dozen mostly regular attendees spoke to one another, sharing food and drinks spread out on a large table. Mr. Kinoshita sat quietly in a corner, eating voraciously and drinking from the best bottle of whiskey.\u201cGrandpa, you have expensive tastes, don\u2019t you?\u201d the host said, loudly enough for everyone to hear.Some of the attendees said they had never seen Mr. Kinoshita before, though he was a regular just like them. I remembered what a community leader had told me about the men at risk of lonely deaths. The leader, an active Buddhist with a philosophical bent, said that those men \u2014 cut off from much human contact \u2014 were ghosts and ciphers, using a Japanese word that, phonetically, meant both.Perhaps the other regulars, all of them also elderly, had really never noticed Mr. Kinoshita. The exception was a man wearing a blue T-shirt with \u201cThe Coach\u201d on it. He spoke briefly with Mr. Kinoshita, who told him about the Eurotunnel and showed him the key holder, his fingers never letting go.By the last song, Mr. Kinoshita was facing a wall. He had turned around his chair, sinking into the music\u2019s sweetness.\u201cMonsieur,\u201d the man in the coach T-shirt said, tapping him tenderly on the shoulder, \u201cit\u2019s over.\u201dThe housing complex in Mrs. Ito\u2019s books and memories, like the other aging danchi across Japan, has become a strong object of nostalgia in recent years. Movies, books and blogs have proliferated, dissecting and celebrating various aspects of life in the danchi.They were mostly fueled by a longing for a golden age in Japan\u2019s postwar history, when the country, it seemed, was united in a vision of the future. But they depicted a world far removed from actual life in places like Tokiwadaira, where the present had broken from the past.As it slipped into late summer, community leaders hoped there would be no more lonely deaths this season. Relatives of one of the dead men had stepped forward, hiring the professionals who clean out apartments where lonely deaths have occurred. Though weeks had passed, the door of the 67-year-old man who had died in Mrs. Ito\u2019s section was still taped over and his smell remained in the stairs outside.Showers of cicadas fell on Tokiwadaira. Their empty shells and dead bodies lay scattered everywhere. Mrs. Ito found them in the stairway outside her apartment. One lay in front of Mr. Kinoshita\u2019s door.With the Obon festival of the dead approaching, the supermarkets began selling Obon kits, which included thin wooden sticks, a little horse and a cow. When lit, the burning sticks guided ancestors back to this world on a galloping horse. After three days, the living sent the ancestors back to the other world, slowly, on the back of a cow. It was the annual reunion of the living and the dead.Mrs. Ito had stopped celebrating Obon decades ago. In the danchi, she couldn\u2019t light the sticks in front of her door, as her family had done in Tokyo. But the pears she had ordered were delivered, as they were every summer, just before Obon. Calls of thanks arrived, including one during her monthly visit to her husband\u2019s grave.\u201cHello? Who is this please? Eriko?\u201d Mrs. Ito said, answering her cellphone in front of the grave.Mrs. Ito and Eriko, her stepdaughter, rarely spoke. Mrs. Ito sent pears. Eriko sent her carnations on Mother\u2019s Day. The phone call lasted a couple of minutes.\u201cBut you take care. You\u2019ll be 60 years old, soon enough. There\u2019s no contact \u2014 I know, there are a lot of people. I even have great-grandchildren. Everybody\u2019s busy, that\u2019s why I imagine there\u2019s no contact. Thanks for the carnations. All right, you take care of yourself.\u201dMrs. Ito resumed cleaning the grave, pulling weeds and pouring water over the headstone where her name was engraved in red \u2014 the color of a living person who intended to enter that grave some day.\u201cWhen I die,\u201d she said, \u201cthey can just take out the color.\u201dHer cremated remains would be buried under the headstone. Her possessions, even her exhaustively chronicled autobiographies, would almost certainly be incinerated.It was a very short walk from Mrs. Ito\u2019s home to the ground-floor apartment of her neighbor, Toyoko Sakai, 83, the woman tasked with looking at her window once a day.Mrs. Ito lit a stick of incense and clasped her hands before the woman\u2019s Buddhist altar. A portrait of Mrs. Sakai\u2019s deceased husband sat in a frame between bouquets of flowers. A melon and a big round pear, one of the pears Mrs. Ito had sent her, sat below the portrait.\u201cBecause you\u2019re kind enough to look after me, I have to bring something,\u201d Mrs. Ito said.Mrs. Sakai, who was hard of hearing but had good eyes, had an unobstructed view of Mrs. Ito\u2019s window on the third floor, making her a good choice to watch the paper screen.Lately, though, Mrs. Sakai\u2019s attention had been drawn to another building, to a fourth-floor apartment where garbage was piling up on the balcony.\u201cOn the fourth floor,\u201d she added, excitedly. \u201cYou can see it from here.\u201dHiding her anxiety, Mrs. Ito redirected her neighbor to her apartment, making sure that she was not unduly distracted and was still keeping an eye on her window on the third floor.\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Mrs. Sakai said, looking out her window toward Mrs. Ito\u2019s. \u201cThere, on the fourth floor.\u201d\u201cThe third floor,\u201d Mrs. Ito reminded her again, gently correcting her neighbor. \u201cI\u2019m on the third floor.\u201dMrs. Sakai, not hearing, went on, describing the window on the fourth floor.\u201cI\u2019m on the third floor,\u201d Mrs. Ito repeated in a louder voice.\u201cThe third floor!\u201d Mrs. Sakai said, finally understanding.\u201cThe third floor, the one with the black net,\u201d Mrs. Ito said, as the two women laughed at the possibility that Mrs. Sakai had been looking at the wrong window all along.The Obon holidays had passed, as always, without a word from any of Mr. Kinoshita\u2019s relatives. He had stayed mostly inside, reading a book that lay next to his pillow, \u201cMen\u2019s H. Women\u2019s H\u201d \u2014 H being slang for sex.As the oldest male, Mr. Kinoshita should have been the one to look after the family grave, but he had relinquished the duty. He had no intention of entering the family grave. He had caused his sisters and brothers too many problems with his bankruptcy, he said.He had a son from a first marriage that had ended when the boy was a toddler \u2014 \u201cI may have neglected him.\u201d They exchanged New Year\u2019s cards. Years ago, Mr. Kinoshita recalled with a smile, his son wrote that he was enjoying being a father.\u201cEven if they engrave my name on a headstone,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s nobody who will visit my grave.\u201dInstead, he had registered with a medical school to donate his body after death. The school would take care of everything. Every fall, it would hold a memorial service at a Buddhist temple for Mr. Kinoshita and all other donors. It would clean out his apartment. His T-shirt and his key holder, perhaps like Mrs. Ito\u2019s books, would be swallowed up in an incinerator.He was just worried about dying a lonely death. His organs, after all, had to prove useful.\u201cIf you tell them to come and get a rotten body for medical research,\u201d he said, \u201cthey won\u2019t come.\u201dAs it had for decades, Tokiwadaira held its Bon dance during the last weekend of August. The late summer evenings were already noticeably cooler.Mrs. Ito seemed troubled. Her neighbor\u2019s confusion over the window had unsettled her. It was clear, she said, that the woman was not reliable. A day passed and Mrs. Ito thought about it some more. Over the years, her neighbor had visited her home \u2014 on the third floor \u2014 so surely she must know where Mrs. Ito lived. It was, Mrs. Ito convinced herself, just a lapse.A few days before the dance, Mrs. Ito got a phone call from her lunch companion, Mr. Kinoshita. After being cooped up in his apartment for what seemed like years, he couldn\u2019t wait to go the dance and checked with Madame Ito to make sure of the date. She had stopped going decades ago, after her children grew up. When the danchi swelled with children, the dance was held in a large park, not in the small plaza where it was now taking place.\u201cThis now,\u201d she said, \u201cis nothing.\u201dPeople began gathering after sunset. They danced in circles around a stage in the middle of the plaza, illuminated by hanging red and white lanterns.Mr. Kinoshita slowly pushed his silver chair through the crowd, resting on a bench under an elm tree. He faced away from the women dancing on the stage, the ones wearing the kimonos he had longed to see, just as he had turned away from the jazz singer. When introduced to someone new, he simply said, \u201cThe only thing I have left is the Eurotunnel.\u201dIt was getting dark. Crickets were singing, the harbingers of autumn in Japan. Deeper into the danchi, toward Mrs. Ito\u2019s apartment, the door of the dead 67-year-old man was still taped over, the smell refusing to disappear. Deeper still, past the deserted pool and the playground where her daughter used to play, Mrs. Ito\u2019s window was visible, faintly, in the night.The paper screen was closed, waiting for her to slide it back open in the morning. \u2610Kantaro Suzuki contributed reporting.Produced by Craig Allen, David Furst, Megan Specia and Gaia TripoliAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "She Took On Colombia\u2019s Soda Industry. Then She Was Silenced.", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 It began with menacing phone calls, strange malfunctions of the office computers, and men in parked cars photographing the entrance to the small consumer advocacy group\u2019s offices.Then at dusk one day last December, Dr. Esperanza Cer\u00f3n, the head of the organization, said she noticed two strange men on motorcycles trailing her Chevy sedan as she headed home from work. She tried to lose them in Bogot\u00e1\u2019s rush-hour traffic, but they edged up to her car and pounded on the windows.\u201cIf you don\u2019t keep your mouth shut,\u201d one man shouted, she recalled in a recent interview, \u201cyou know what the consequences will be.\u201dThe battle over taxing sugar-sweetened beverages is becoming one of the world\u2019s most ferocious policy brawls \u2014 a clash of science, politics and money in dozens of countries and cities.The International Council of Beverages Associations, the parent organization of trade groups around the world fighting the taxes, would not directly answer the question about whether its allies in Colombia were connected to the alleged harassment, but it condemned such actions.\u201cWe reject under any circumstance the improper influence or harassment of any individual or organization for any purpose, at any time, in any way,\u201d Katherine W. Loatman, executive director of the organization, said in a statement.The battles have been particularly intense in emerging markets as the industry seeks to make up for falling soda consumption in wealthier nations. Latin America has surpassed the United States as the world\u2019s biggest soft-drink market, according to the World Health Organization, with sales of carbonated soft drinks doubling there since 2000 while they declined in the United States.\u201cSlapping a tax on our products and walking away won\u2019t do anything about obesity in this country or globally,\u201d said William Dermody, spokesman for the American Beverage Association, an industry trade group.Mexico also showcased how dirty the fight could get.The Australian Beverages Council wrote in its 2016 annual report that fighting a soft drinks tax \u201chas been consuming vast amounts of resources,\u201d and that \u201cour learnings from other markets through our international network tells us that these types of threats must be constantly challenged before they get before a parliament for debate.\u201dIn Colombia, where soda is often cheaper than bottled water, the soda-tax fight took place in a key market for beverage makers. Sales volume of carbonated drinks here has climbed more than 25 percent over the past 15 years; during that same time in the United States, it fell 12 percent, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm.Coke and Pepsi were far less visible in the Colombia battle, leaving the big national beverage company, Postob\u00f3n, in the spotlight. Postob\u00f3n, a drinks maker and distributor for Pepsi, is part of a huge conglomerate that includes sugar cane growers, sugar mills and the country\u2019s biggest media company, RCN Televisi\u00f3n, which helped disseminate the anti-tax message. Postob\u00f3n and RCN declined interview requests.The stage was set for a clash between a powerful industry and a stubborn public advocate.In early 2016, Colombia, a nation of 49 million, was facing the unfamiliar prospect of stability and peace. After decades of civil war and narco-terrorism, Colombians were enjoying the fruits of an aggressive United States-backed military campaign that had largely decimated the country\u2019s drug cartels. Unemployment was near historical lows, the poverty rate was dropping and millions were hopeful about the possibility of lasting peace with the country\u2019s main rebel group, the FARC.In March 2016, the country\u2019s health minister, Alejandro Gaviria Uribe, proposed a 20 percent tax on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages \u2014 the equivalent of about 10 cents on a liter bottle \u2014 that became part of a larger tax overhaul backed by Colombia\u2019s president and the Ministry of Finance.\u201cFor the first time in our lives, we thought we might become a normal country and be able to deal with issues other than violence,\u201d said Diana Guarnizo, a lawyer with Dejusticia, a rights group that helped promote the soda tax. \u201cHere we were, an organization that had dealt with peace, violence, land reform and gross injustice, and suddenly we had the luxury to talk about what mothers are putting in their children\u2019s lunchboxes.\u201dThe measure was designed to inject $340 million a year into Colombia\u2019s chronically underfunded national health care system, but Mr. Gaviria had a larger goal: to dampen soda consumption in a country with an obesity rate that had tripled since 1980 to 19 percent of adults. The fastest growth had occurred among Colombian youth from ages 5 to 17. Each year, 4,000 people age 30 to 70 die from obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes, the Health Ministry said.The issue attracted the attention of Dr. Cer\u00f3n, whose 10-employee organization had previously worked on climate change, smoking restrictions and the lack of potable water in poor communities. Encouraged by the health minister\u2019s soda tax announcement, they formed a coalition of three dozen civic organizations they called the Alliance for Food Health.They received crucial support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, a foundation created by Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, which dispatched experts from the United States. It also provided pivotal funding, including $260,000 for the public service ad \u2014 an amount nearly equal to Educar\u2019s entire annual budget \u2014 and paid for enhanced security at the group\u2019s offices.Postob\u00f3n, the soft drink company, promptly filed a complaint with the government\u2019s consumer protection agency, the Superintendent of Industry and Commerce, claiming that the ad\u2019s use of the teaspoon as a unit of measurement was imprecise and that it unfairly suggested that all sweetened drinks were unhealthy.Dr. Luis Fernando G\u00f3mez, a professor of preventive medicine at Javeriana University in Bogot\u00e1 who backed the tax measure, said Postob\u00f3n\u2019s allegations about the commercial were disingenuous. \u201cEvery fact and figure cited in that ad was backed up by mainstream science,\u201d he said.But the head of the Colombian consumer protection agency, a presidential appointee, sided with the industry petitioners. Just two weeks later, in a decision that Colombian legal experts described as unusually swift, the agency ordered the commercial withdrawn.Borrowing almost identical language from Postob\u00f3n\u2019s complaint \u2014 which had been filed by a company lawyer who had previously led the agency \u2014 the superintendent\u2019s office said consumers had the right to truthful information, not messages that were \u201cmisleading, imprecise and confusing.\u201dThe ruling went on to bar Educar Consumidores employees from speaking publicly about the links between sugar and obesity, an edict so sweeping it included the Health Ministry\u2019s own research on the subject.The consumer agency did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cWe were completely shut down,\u201d Dr. Cer\u00f3n said. \u201cCensored.\u201dPostob\u00f3n is a unit of one of Colombia\u2019s largest and most respected conglomerates, Organizaci\u00f3n Ardila L\u00fclle. Founded in the early 1950s by Carlos Ardila L\u00fclle, 87, Organizaci\u00f3n Ardila L\u00fclle has helped define the country\u2019s modern identity through a raft of companies that own a soccer team, an insurance company and the dealerships that sell Dodge, Jeep and Ford vehicles.Postob\u00f3n is a storied brand that sells a rainbow of homegrown drinks. Among its best-known products are a cola called Colombiana and Manzana Postob\u00f3n, a century-old apple-flavored drink that is something of a national icon.Organizaci\u00f3n Ardila L\u00fclle remained silent during the soda-tax debate, and company executives declined to be interviewed. Instead, Postob\u00f3n, RCN and allies like the National Business Association of Colombia carried the message that the tax would cost jobs, decimate independent convenience shop owners and choke the economy.\u201cIn Colombia, the sugar industry and the main media companies belong to the same economic conglomerates,\u201d Mr. Gaviria, the health minister, said. \u201cThey have an intimidating power. And they used it.\u201dThat fall, at least 90 lobbyists worked to sway legislators, according to a tally of visitor logs obtained by Educar Consumidores. During committee hearings on the measure, lobbyists often sat next to lawmakers, a flagrant violation of congressional rules, said \u00d3scar Ospina Quintero, a legislator from the Green Alliance party. Mr. Ospina said he protested the lobbyists\u2019 presence in the chamber but was rebuffed by congressional leaders.\u201cThe response was fierce,\u201d Mr. Gaviria said. \u201cI remember that, during one of the debates, a senator said to me: \u2018In all my years in Congress I\u2019ve never seen a lobbying effort like this.\u2019\u201dIn October, not long after she was censored by the government, Dr. Cer\u00f3n found a tactic she thought might keep attention on the subject without running afoul of the government\u2019s order silencing her. In a blog item posted on the Alliance for Food Health website, she made fun of an RCN soap opera from 1980s called \u201cAz\u00facar,\u201d or Sugar, that was set in Colombia\u2019s sugar cane heartland. Scrawled across a publicity poster for the show, she wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to watch Sugar; it\u2019s another to drink it in excess.\u201dAn RCN lawyer demanded she delete the post, claiming it was intellectual property theft. She complied, but the network filed a complaint with federal prosecutors who, in turn, opened a criminal investigation. The case, still pending, carries a possible fine of $300,000.\u201cIf they win,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be financially ruined.\u201dIt was around this time that employees at Educar\u2019s offices began to complain about echoes and other voices on their cellphones. They suspected they might be under surveillance. Others found it hard to use the internet in the office. In October, Dr. Cer\u00f3n\u2019s office phone ceased functioning entirely. \u201cSometimes we could not work at all because our laptops would stop following orders and the mouse would just do what it wanted,\u201d Diana Vivas, the group\u2019s lawyer, said.Ms. Lane of Bloomberg Philanthropies was so concerned that she stopped using email and the phone to discuss strategy with Educar. Instead, she moved communications to some of the same encrypted apps used after the surveillance of soda-tax advocates was discovered in Mexico.Called in to investigate, Andr\u00e9s Erazo, Educar\u2019s longtime tech consultant, said he discovered that antivirus software on workplace computers had been disabled. He also found spyware on the office router that gave an unknown outsider access to the organization\u2019s web traffic and online communication. According to Mr. Erazo, three cellphones \u2014 including those used by Dr. Cer\u00f3n and Ms. Vivas \u2014 had been compromised by spyware.Mr. Erazo urged Dr. Cer\u00f3n to buy new cellphones but she refused. \u201cIf they\u2019re listening to us, what are they going to hear?\u201d he recalled her telling him. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a public health campaign!\u201dOne morning in mid-November, Dr. Cer\u00f3n was startled awake at 5 a.m. by a call to her cellphone.\u201cShut up, you old wench,\u201d the caller yelled, according to a report she filed with the Fiscal General de la Naci\u00f3n, Colombia\u2019s prosecutorial agency.In early December, Dr. Cer\u00f3n was walking to the gym when a man, his face obscured by a hooded sweatshirt, accosted her with the same message. \u201cC\u00e1llese,\u201d he yelled before walking away, or, \u201ckeep your mouth shut.\u201dShe reported both episodes to prosecutors.A spokesman for the prosecutorial agency declined to comment on Dr. C\u00e9ron\u2019s complaints, citing privacy rules that bar discussion of cases with anyone not directly involved.Dr. Cer\u00f3n stopped driving alone. And she pressed the local news media to cover the intimidation, but it was facing its own challenges from tax opponents.With its cordon of armed guards, bomb-sniffing dogs and airport-style X-ray machines, the headquarters of Colombia\u2019s oldest newspaper, El Espectador, is among the most heavily fortified compounds in the country. The need for such measures is driven home by a sixth-floor display: showcased behind glass is a yellowing front page reporting the assassination of El Espectador\u2019s editor, Guillermo Cano, who was gunned down on Dec. 17, 1986, as he drove home from work.Three years later, a huge truck bomb shattered the newspaper\u2019s offices, killing a reporter and wounding 83 others. During the 1980s and 1990s, violence claimed the lives of a dozen El Espectador employees \u2014 all victims of Colombian drug cartels angered by the newspaper\u2019s unflinching coverage.El Espectador news editors said they sought to cover the soda tax fight evenhandedly in the news pages, even as the paper supported the tax in its editorials.Industry executives were not happy with the paper\u2019s stance, but they got especially upset when it produced a video, part of a biweekly commentary called La Pulla, that lampooned tax opponents for ignoring scientific evidence about the risks of excess sugar.\u201cOnce we published the video, things got crazy,\u201d the paper\u2019s health and science editor, Pablo Correa, said.The video was posted just before midnight on Dec. 15, quickly drawing 500,000 views. In the morning, Fidel Cano, the publisher of El Espectador and a nephew of the paper\u2019s slain editor, said he had received a call from a senior advertising executive at the newspaper who told him a representative from Coca-Cola had called in protest and demanded that the Sprite bottle be removed.Mr. Cano winced recalling what came next. With the prospect of litigation and lost ad revenue, he says he ordered the bottle edited out. In a small act of defiance, he allowed the Sprite advertisement tagline to remain.The altered video went viral, drawing more than two million views and prompting a public discussion about censorship and the power of the soda industry.\u201cDid they win?\u201d Mr. Cano reflected. \u201cNot really.\u201dReached by phone, the newspaper\u2019s vice president for advertising, Mauricio Uma\u00f1a, disputed Mr. Cano\u2019s account, saying he had not received a call from Coca-Cola or any other soda company executive.Other media outlets felt the industry\u2019s pressure.At the Colombian branch of the online news site Vice, the editorial staff clashed with advertising executives over their efforts to squelch a column criticizing the soda industry. Vice had previously run two opinion pieces in favor of the soda tax and the disputed third column did ultimately run, though not on the home page, making it hard for readers to find.The incident was part of what prompted Vice Colombia\u2019s founding editor, Juan Camilo Maldonado, to resign. Mr. Maldonado declined to be interviewed for this article but colleagues with direct knowledge of the incident said he was dismayed the company would cave to pressure from advertisers.A spokesman for Vice did not address the reasons for Mr. Maldonado\u2019s resignation, but said, \u201cThe fact that all of the stories were published and were critical of the soda industry speaks for itself.\u201dOn the last day of 2016, opponents of the tax were victorious. Using a complex procedural maneuver, congressional leaders killed the soda tax, dropping it from the larger tax overhaul package.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t just sugar,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n Duque, a senator from the right-leaning Democratic Center party and a contender in next year\u2019s presidential race, who was a vocal critic of the tax. \u201cWe need a national plan to fight sedentary lifestyles, better product labeling and education efforts that teach people to eat more fruit, fish and vegetables.\u201d\u201cIt was a great victory for free speech in Colombia,\u201d Dr. Cer\u00f3n said. \u201cThe only pity is it came too late.\u201dThe article in La Rep\u00fablica, however, did not mention one key ingredient: sugar. According to the label on the drink, one juice box of it contains 13 grams of sugar, more than half the daily recommended level for children.Reporting was contributed by Wesley Tomaselli from Bogot\u00e1, Anahad O\u2019Connor from San Francisco and Ayesha Venkataraman from Mumbai, India.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Keir Starmer Save Britain From Brexit?", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday Profile\u201cI feel, like many others of the 48 percent, abandoned and leaderless,\u201d protests the questioner, referring to those who voted to remain in the bloc in last year\u2019s divisive Brexit referendum.For Mr. Starmer, who speaks for the opposition Labour Party on Brexit, replying means walking a familiar tightrope. With Labour having consented to the plebiscite, he says, it would be intellectually dishonest to say, \u201cNow it\u2019s gone the way I don\u2019t want, so I\u2019m not going to accept the result.\u201dThen comes the counterpunch: \u201cI don\u2019t give up on any of the values that made me want to remain,\u201d he tells the 40 or so students sitting in a semicircle around him, calling for a relationship with the bloc \u201cbased on a progressive partnership.\u201dIn recent months, Mr. Starmer has navigated deftly around deep divisions on Brexit while giving hope not just to those who want Britain to remain close to the European Union but also to those who want Britons, to use the catchphrase, to exit from Brexit.Articulate, personable, yet serious and intense, Mr. Starmer, 55, a former human rights lawyer, has held one of Britain\u2019s top legal jobs and been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. (He prefers not to use the title \u201csir.\u201d)Allies portray him as approachable, hard-working and a devoted fan of the Arsenal soccer team.\u201cIf you go to the pub with him you will see him in his element: down to earth, grounded, connected to those around him,\u201d Mr. Sands added.\u201cSimpering media reports highlighted his smart suits, floppy hair and chiseled good looks,\u201d it wrote. \u201cIndeed, actor Colin Firth was said to have based his performance as Mark Darcy (the human rights lawyer character in the Bridget Jones films) on Starmer.\u201dAccording to Mr. Firth, that is incorrect. But, while Mr. Starmer was the director of public prosecutions \u2014 effectively the country\u2019s chief prosecutor \u2014 his persona was once borrowed by a con man to impress female victims.The real Mr. Starmer is in fact extremely courteous even \u2014 according to Mr. Sands \u2014 at 7 a.m. meetings.\u201cHe will seek out a decent position to take that those with a range of different positions can be associated with, even where there are extreme polarities of view,\u201d Mr. Sands said.Such attributes have been vital since the referendum, which tore Labour in opposite directions. While younger, metropolitan supporters generally opted to stay in the European Union, many traditional working-class voters were attracted by the Brexit campaign\u2019s focus on curbing immigration.Labour lawmakers overwhelmingly wanted to remain, but Mr. Corbyn and John McDonnell, the party\u2019s spokesman on financial affairs, worried that the European Union\u2019s rules might obstruct some of their interventionist economic policies.Mr. Starmer seems to have won the point by persuading them that a rupture with the European Union would wreak enough havoc to render their economic priorities moot.\u201cIn the end, if you want to implement a progressive set of policies, then you need a strong economy in order to do so,\u201d Mr. Starmer said.That sort of quiet, behind-the-scenes persuasion comes naturally to Mr. Starmer, whose father was a toolmaker and mother a nurse, and who became the first university graduate in his family.\u201cThe last thing you want is to be different to everybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s fantastic that people just say \u2018Keir\u2019 and most people know who they are talking about.\u201dAfter studying law at Leeds and Oxford Universities, Mr. Starmer became a lawyer specializing in human rights. He fought several high-profile cases, and subsequently rose to become director of public prosecutions.Elected to Parliament in 2015, he found himself in a party led by Mr. Corbyn, Labour\u2019s most left-wing leader in decades. Mr. Starmer promptly joined a rebellion and resigned his post. But he was soon brought back, this time in charge of Brexit policy.Then, during the summer, Mr. Starmer engineered the decisive softening of Labour\u2019s Brexit policy, calling for a transition for \u201cas short as possible, but as long as is necessary\u201d after Britain quits the bloc in March 2019, during which Britain remains aligned with the bloc\u2019s single market, which lays down common rules, and customs union, which smooths tariff-free trade.For the longer term, he is open to membership in a customs union, though he is fuzzier about the single market. He argues that full membership would be impossible under current rules, but suggests that Labour could get a much closer alignment than the Conservatives because it believes in regulating labor and other standards and would not aim to undercut the European Union economically.But some have speculated that he is playing a long game, expecting the transition period to be extended (as trade negotiations drag on) long enough for the public to turn against Brexit, particularly if the economy should go into a prolonged slump. Were that to happen, remaining part of the single market, at the very minimum, might seem attractive.But pro-Europe critics predict that once Britain leaves the bloc, it would be too late to reverse Brexit.\u201cI think he is trying to be a bridge between essentially irreconcilable positions,\u201d said Tom Baldwin, who was senior adviser to the previous Labour leader, Ed Miliband.\u201cLabour\u2019s position is ducking, diving and triangulation,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said, adding that Mr. Starmer\u2019s idea for transition amounted only to \u201ca cliff edge with a longer diving board than the Tory one.\u201dMr. Starmer denies harboring a strategy for reversing Brexit, saying only that he is content to go on reconciling the Leavers and the Remainers in his party.\u201cEverybody has been urging me to jump one way or the other,\u201d he said, \u201cand I have refused, at every twist and turn.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Two Contrasting Views of Silicon Valley\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryThe pervasive influence of Silicon Valley on our economy, culture and politics is a subject worthy of close study. Two important new books released this week offer startlingly different approaches and conclusions on these complex issues. The contrasting epigraphs that begin the works perfectly reflect their respective perspectives.To be fair, the conflict in visions is less stark than it seems because the two authors are focused on different time periods. \u201cTroublemakers\u201d covers \u201cthe generational handoff\u201d that happened between the late 1960s and the early \u201980s \u201cas pioneers of the semiconductor industry passed the baton to younger up-and-comers.\u201d Mr. Cohen\u2019s ire primarily targets those \u201cwho helped nurture the World Wide Web to prosperity in the 1990s before turning to investing.\u201dOne does not have to be sympathetic to a more benign view of the technology industry to appreciate Ms. Berlin\u2019s deeply researched and dramatic narrative of Silicon Valley\u2019s early years in \u201cTroublemakers.\u201d To tell this story, she selects seven lesser-known but influential figures to follow closely throughout that period. These include the first woman to take a technology company public, the first chairman of Apple, and a man who played critical roles in government to create the internet and in industry to commercialize it through the personal computer. Their names will most likely be unfamiliar, but their meticulously told stories permit the reader to gain a nuanced understanding of the emergence of the broader technology ecosystem that has enabled Silicon Valley to thrive.Nuance is not a word that comes to mind in reading Mr. Cohen\u2019s attack on Silicon Valley\u2019s powers that be. The first two chapters are devoted to key figures in the history of Stanford\u2019s administration and computer science department, emphasizing both the university\u2019s willingness to trade off academic rigor for financial gain and its institutional sympathy for eugenics in the early 1900s and, more recently, extreme libertarianism. These underlying themes, in Mr. Cohen\u2019s view, underpin \u201cthe Stanford model of integrating the hacker and the entrepreneur.\u201d This model is reflected in staking William Hewlett and David Packard in the 1930s, establishing the Stanford Industrial Park in the 1950s and obtaining a $336 million payout from Google stock in return for granting the exclusive PageRank license.It is this unholy alliance between hacker and entrepreneur values that Mr. Cohen rails against for the balance of the book. Although he pauses for a handful of pages to speak about Microsoft \u2014 \u201cIf the Know-It-Alls\u2019 values represent a merger of a hacker\u2019s radical individualism and an entrepreneur\u2019s greed, then only one man can be considered their forefather: Bill Gates\u201d \u2014 he believes that the negative ramifications \u201conly fully flourished with the widespread adoption of the World Wide Web starting in the late 1990s.\u201d And so beginning with Marc Andreessen, who developed the first commercialized web browser, Netscape Navigator, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d proceeds to attack the character of just about every boldfaced name among tech billionaires. All are found guilty of either always promoting the insidious tech dogma that places no constraints on their ability to disrupt the status quo for their own financial gain or \u2014 as in the case of the once idealistic founders of Google and Facebook \u2014 having along the way been \u201cseduced by the power and money offered by venture capitalists.\u201dThe history that underpins that overarching thesis feels both selective and less than rigorous. Niels Reimers, the founder of Stanford\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing and one of the seven key industry figures profiled in detail in \u201cTroublemakers,\u201d is not even mentioned in \u201cThe-Know-It-Alls.\u201d Given the complex negotiations required to secure university approval, this seems like a significant oversight for a book whose thesis hinges in part on Stanford\u2019s supposed unthinking commercialism. And statements like computer science was \u201cstill something of an obscure discipline in the late 1980s\u201d just don\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. By 1990, there were almost 800 computer science degree programs offered at colleges and universities, enrolling tens of thousands of students.Although Mr. Cohen has identified legitimately disturbing aspects of the tech culture, he becomes repetitive, and his tone is unnecessarily conspiratorial. He also ignores when the facts contradict his assertions. Mr. Cohen complains about the \u201cPayPal mafia,\u201d former employees who \u201cprovided each other with cash, counsel and contacts.\u201d Mr. Cohen finds \u201csomething jarring about a group of self-styled survival of the fittest free marketeers committing to a strategy of collective risk and mutual support.\u201dWhen the Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is profiled as a contrast to the libertarian fanaticism and raw commercialism of the Know-It-Alls, his inability to raise funding is used to reinforce this point: \u201cWales and his partners had no rich friends to lean on in tough times.\u201d The narrative makes clear, however, that his problem was a flawed business model, not his lack of access to the PayPal mafia or other venture investors. Similarly, Mr. Cohen does not directly confront the irony that the story of Wikipedia\u2019s ultimate success was made possible only by its free-riding on Google\u2019s powerful \u2014 but in his view morally suspect \u2014 search engine.The tech industry has earned a takedown book that documents its self-interested justifications for any number of policies that are clearly not in the public interest. Its track record on matters including cybersecurity, gender equality and privacy is shameful. The brief profiles of \u201cThe Know-It Alls,\u201d sprinkled with gratuitous ad hominem observations (for example, Mr. Cohen writes that PayPal is responsible for \u201creleasing into the wild a self-satisfied Peter Thiel, a one-man wrecking crew who has been sowing chaos through American society up to this very day\u201d), do not get the job done.Given the profound impact on our lives of the technology industry and the apparent flaws in its current culture, both books leave the reader wondering where to go from here. \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d suggests that \u201cEurope provides a model\u201d relying on extensive regulation but, given the absence of any European tech giants of note, this seems like throwing the baby out with the bath water. Although the compelling history in \u201cTroublemakers\u201d provides a number of tantalizing clues as to where things got off track, this is not the focus of the book. Ms. Berlin does not whitewash the aspects of even the valley\u2019s early years that foreshadow the more profound cultural issues to emerge in the industry\u2019s middle age, writing, \u201cIt takes a certain kind of audacity to think you can launch a company, much less invent an industry \u2014 and audacity often veers into arrogance.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t go out of her way to explore their implications, either.When the founding of Fairchild Semiconductor is discussed, William Shockley is mentioned in passing, but Ms. Berlin notes that he \u201chad not yet fully descended into the paranoia and eugenic fervor that would later mar his reputation.\u201d In fact, his paranoia and abusiveness at least were already well known and, given that these qualities have been recurring contemporary industry themes, would have been worth examining.Similarly, when it\u2019s noted that a key to the venture capitalist Don Valentine\u2019s success was his willingness to overlook \u201cdeviant\u201d behavior, some discussion of the downside of letting the hacker culture run wild might have made sense.Silicon Valley\u2019s history is still being written. Both of these books are important reminders that whether or not it is ultimately a story with a happy ending will be a function of our collective willingness to closely examine the sector\u2019s origins to better understand not only the sources of innovation but how the most destructive aspects of the culture were allowed to fester for so long.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Can a Wild Daisy Rejuvenate Croatia\u2019s Farming Economy?", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZadar JournalZADAR, Croatia \u2014 For generations, residents of Zadar, an idyllic town on the Adriatic coast of Croatia, used the dry, stringy stems and yellow blossoms of a common variety of a wild daisy as kindling, mostly to singe the hair off pigs destined for the spit.But about five years ago, cosmetics manufacturers and the essential oils industry started using a rare extract from the flower \u2014 known as the curry plant for its spicy aroma \u2014 as a critical ingredient in high-end creams, ointments and tinctures, sold for their purported rejuvenating powers.So let the pigs shave themselves, local residents decided, turning their attention to gathering bushels of the once widely ignored weed, in hopes of creating a new local industry to add to an economy based on construction, fruit farming, olive oil and a touch of tourism.So far they haven\u2019t had too much success.\u201cI should start putting some of this stuff on my own face,\u201d said Nino Simunic, 48, ignoring the bucolic vista of yachts and ferries crossing Zadar\u2019s channel.Instead, he scanned the harsh ground from atop his tractor, putt-putting across a moonlike limestone hillside, for any signs of a curry plant, also known as \u201cimmortelle\u201d for its ability to survive in dry terrain and to remain alive long after being plucked.In 2015, Mr. Simunic, a veteran of Croatia\u2019s early-1990s war for independence, ended a tumultuous 15-year career in local politics and joined the ranks of residents seeking some sort of financial boost from the curry plant. A local monastery of Benedictine nuns became partners with him, providing the 12 acres of land he\u2019s farming in exchange for a cut of revenues, he said. If there are any.It\u2019s Mr. Simunic\u2019s first harvest, and he\u2019s not saddled with any expectations.\u201cIf it covers at least some of the fuel and lunch costs, I\u2019m happy,\u201d he said.The search for profit from the curry plant is driven by Croatia\u2019s continuing economic troubles. The global financial crisis was largely responsible for a six-year recession. And the country\u2019s 2013 move to join the European Union brought competitively priced goods from elsewhere in the bloc onto store shelves, adding to the woes of the struggling agricultural and manufacturing sectors.These days, the nation of 4.2 million relies on a tourism boom, mainly on the Adriatic coast, with the summer season responsible for nearly a fifth of its economic output.So farmers in inland regions and towns like Zadar are always on the lookout for a new avenue of cash.That\u2019s where immortelle \u2014 with the Latin name Helichrysum italicum \u2014 fits in.\u201cThe essential oils found within the flower help to improve the skin\u2019s ability to fight the effects of environmental aggressions, which are known to accelerate skin aging,\u201d said Lucy Primrose, the director of learning and organizational development for L\u2019Occitane. The company\u2019s line of immortelle-infused products has become \u201cadored by our customers,\u201d she said.But the French cosmetics giant gets its immortelle from farms in Corsica. And so far Zadar\u2019s farmers have had little luck creating a direct partnership with a cosmetics or essential oils company. Instead they sell their curry plant harvests in raw form to nearby distillers, who act as a bridge to manufacturers that have relationships with larger cosmetics firms.Selling immortelle to distillers is somewhat profitable; the plant\u2019s oil fetches up to 2,500 euros per kilogram, or about 1.15 liters.Zadar\u2019s immortelle farmers think the quantity and quality of their individual crops will become too great for the cosmetics industry to ignore. Their hope remains as resilient as the immortelle.In the first years after manufacturers took interest in the plant, many farmers tried to increase their crop output. But that involved watering and fertilization techniques that diluted the quality of the extracted oil.Distillers then lowered their offers for raw plants.\u201cThis is a classic Croatian agriculture story, from success to failure,\u201d said Mario Skelin, a local plant conservationist, who pointed to a distinct lack of unity among Zadar\u2019s many curry plant farmers when negotiating with distillers and producers. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten to the failure part yet.\u201dMr. Skelin has tried to band farmers together to gain leverage when dealing with distillers. So far individualism has held sway, with farmers wanting to build their own distilleries.\u201cThe problem is there is no industrial standard,\u201d Mr. Skelin said, showing a picture of three test tubes containing immortelle extract \u2014 each a different shade of yellow. He said that many wholesale buyers priced oils without explaining their criteria or pricing decisions. \u201cWe need to do a better job of branding ourselves,\u201d he said.Some farmers are hedging their bets, investing in other oft-neglected plants.Ivica Djurica, 62, had an accidental over-yield of his curry plants six years ago, with a surplus of 800,000 seedlings just as locals started looking to immortelle. Mr. Djurica sold his extra seedlings to ambitious local farmers, making him an unwitting cog in the curry plant\u2019s local industry.Now he and his wife, Mirna Djurica, 47, hope to expand their business, adding lavender, hyssop and other medicinal herbs to the property. The idea is a full-fledged essential oil and aromatherapy operation.Arid, dusty soil crunched under her feet as she walked through a field while cicadas crackled from the bushes jutting out of the hill.\u201cA tough life is good for curry plants,\u201d she said, heading back to a small stone bungalow at the end of the field. \u201cAnd this is the life we wanted.\u201dThe Djuricas have plans for an in-house distillery, which could then theoretically finance the creation of a full agri-tourism operation.\u201cWe can\u2019t only grow curry plants,\u201d she said, just as a gust cut across the thick field of green and yellow, kicking up the immortelle\u2019s deep, smokelike peppery smell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Italy, a Neo-Fascist Party\u2019s Small Win Creates Big Unease", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOSTIA, Italy \u2014 When a candidate for a neo-fascist party, CasaPound, won a seat this month on the municipal council of the Roman suburb of Ostia, many Italians were startled.Last week, Italian journalists trekked to Ostia to solemnly protest at the scene of the assault. Around the corner, residents were still celebrating, shrugging off the party\u2019s claims to be the direct descendant of Benito Mussolini\u2019s Fascist Party.\u201cLook at what I\u2019ll show you,\u201d said one, Gianluca Antonucci, as he unzipped his jacket to reveal a black shirt featuring Mussolini\u2019s granite face. \u201cIl Duce.\u201dFor a while, this country seemed an outlier as nationalist and xenophobic forces made gains across Europe. But now some fear that Italy, the birthplace of fascism, is catching up with its neighbors.\u201cIn every state we want nationalist forces to win,\u201d said Luca Marsella, CasaPound\u2019s newly elected council member, who won 9 percent of the vote. \u201cIf this happens in other cities, we\u2019ll have a chance to go into Parliament to defend our nation.\u201dThat is a long, long way off. The party, named after the American poet Ezra Pound, who supported Mussolini, is still statistically irrelevant on the national level.But CasaPound is winning seats in a handful of towns, and some of its core beliefs \u2014 a fondness for Russia and sharp opposition to the European Union, globalization and immigration, which it believes sully the national identity and economy \u2014 are increasingly spreading throughout Italy.Anti-immigration sentiment has grown so popular that the once-secessionist Northern League has dropped the word \u201cNorthern\u2019\u201d from its name as it looks for inroads to the south.The anti-establishment Five Star Movement, while ideologically amorphous, has charismatic firebrand leaders who take the stage to the chanting of their nicknames and then rile up crowds with a message of resentment.All of this makes CasaPound\u2019s leaders hopeful that Italy is newly fertile ground for fascism.The Italian Constitution bans \u201cthe reorganization in any form of the dissolved Fascist Party.\u201d But CasaPound and other neo-fascist movements have skirted the law by calling themselves the descendants of Mussolini. They insist that they believe in democracy and not a fascist dictatorship.\u201cWe are a young and clean political force,\u201d said Simone Di Stefano, the party\u2019s vice president, as he stood under posters of Mussolini in its Roman headquarters.The building, which sits incongruously in the heart of an immigrant neighborhood in central Rome, has served as the party\u2019s home since its leader, Gianluca Iannone, a tattooed and extravagantly bearded member of a right-wing punk band, led followers to occupy the apartments.Of course, there was also Pound, who ranted against Jews on Italian radio and was imprisoned for treason during the war. (The daughter of the poet has tried to make the party change its name.)Members with black boots, tattooed necks and shorn hair guard floors decorated with pictures of Fascist-era marches and banners reading \u201cArm Your Soul.\u201dBut its members exhibit the same fondness for Roman salutes and mythic glory days. CasaPound\u2019s leaders shrug off Mussolini\u2019s racial laws and alliance with Hitler with a nobody\u2019s-perfect nonchalance. They instead prefer to focus on Fascism\u2019s role in Italian modernization and military might.\u201cThat spirit of the nation bloomed in this country during those years,\u201d Mr. Di Stefano said. \u201cAnd I would like to bring that feeling back today.\u201dThat is especially so in Ostia, a suburb of 230,000, home to joblessness, resentment toward immigrants, and an organized crime problem so insidious that the police disbanded the local government two years ago.The journalist who was head-butted was trying to interview a member of a powerful local clan called the Spadas, which had thrown its support behind CasaPound.\u201cI voted for CasaPound, and I\u2019m proud of it,\u201d said Marina Luglu, as she walked out of Bar Music, owned by the head-butter, Roberto Spada, whom she admiringly called \u201cMr. Roberto.\u201dVoters here rewarded the party for its engagement with their rundown housing projects. CasaPound provided a food bank to hundreds of families, sent handymen to fix elevators and lawyers to locals in need.Viviana Prudenzi, a 34-year-old house cleaner walking down a seaside street with her mother, said she voted for CasaPound because its members were \u201cthe only ones who are here helping \u2014 helping the Italians.\u201d\u201cThey call them fascists because they think of Italians and not the foreigners,\u201d she said.This summer, Mr. Marsella, the CasaPound candidate, led a beach patrol of party members in red vests. They forced unlicensed and immigrant vendors, some visibly terrified, off the beach.Leftist activists have accused them of beatings. For recreation, party members whip each other with belts in mosh pits.\u201cWe don\u2019t recognize violence as a political tool, but if we are attacked, we respond,\u201d said Mr. Marsella, a soft-spoken 32-year-old I.T. consultant. Asked whether he had prevailed in his clashes with leftist activists, he cracked a smile. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201dOver the summer, Mr. Marsella and other members of CasaPound clashed with the riot police in Rome as they protested a proposal to grant citizenship to the Italian-born children of immigrants.That history of violence did not bother a group of women gathered in front of one of the Spada family\u2019s gyms. They hailed the CasaPound activists as \u201cgoodfellas.\u201dWhen the Rev. Franco De Donno, a priest known for his works against the Mafia and on behalf of immigrants, walked by, they cursed him as \u201cdisgusting\u201d for taking a leave of absence from his sacramental duties to run for office.They nearly attacked a woman who urged them to acknowledge the drugs and violence that riddled their neighborhood. Five Carabinieri patrol cars came to her aid.Father De Donno, who also earned a seat in the municipal government, said one of his supporters had been beaten by members of CasaPound, including Mr. Marsella. (Mr. Marsella denied this.)\u201cI hope that entering in the institution, Luca Marsella limits his recourse to violent methods,\u201d the priest said.On Sunday, amid an increased police presence, residents will vote in a runoff to decide who will become council president.Giuliana Di Pillo, the leading candidate of the Five Star Movement, acknowledged that CasaPound had siphoned support from her and her center-right opponent.She admitted to some trepidation about serving with a fascist. \u201cCertainly, it worries me,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Hinchey, a former United States representative from New York who championed the environment and blue-collar workers in a political career of nearly four decades, died on Wednesday at his home in Saugerties, in the Hudson Valley. He was 79.The cause was frontotemporal degeneration, a rare terminal neurological disorder, his family said.Mr. Hinchey, a Democrat who retired from Congress in 2013 after 10 terms, began his political career as a state assemblyman in 1975. Within four years he became the chairman of the Assembly\u2019s Environmental Conservation Committee. He served in the Assembly until 1992, when he was elected to Congress.During his time on the state conservation committee, Mr. Hinchey led an investigation into Love Canal, an unfinished waterway in upstate New York that became one of the nation\u2019s first major toxic dump sites. The revelations that emerged would force hundreds of families to evacuate and elevate concerns over toxic waste to national attention.As a state lawmaker, Mr. Hinchey also aided in the preservation and cleanup of the Hudson River and helped pass the first law in the country aimed at controlling acid rain. He also spent 10 years leading an investigation into organized crime\u2019s control of the waste-hauling industry.During his two decades in Congress, Mr. Hinchey served a district that spanned eight counties, from the Hudson Valley to the Finger Lakes region, and included both troubled industrial cities and tourist resorts. To serve his diverse constituents, he pursued an agenda that made the environment a priority and positioned him as an advocate for economic development.He became a fierce critic of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, and an equally strong proponent of renewable energy \u2014 a sector that he saw as critical to the economy and that he hoped could build a hub in upstate New York.Although he had an unassuming demeanor and kept a relatively low profile, Mr. Hinchey came to be known as a reliable Democratic vote and wielded influence with a seat on the powerful Appropriations Committee, where he routinely inserted money for his district and state into federal spending bills.Maurice Dunlea Hinchey was born on Oct. 27, 1938, in New York City to Maurice and Rose Hinchey. He moved to Saugerties with his family as a boy. After graduating from Saugerties High School in 1956, he enlisted in the Navy, serving from 1956-59. He later worked as a laborer at a Hudson Valley cement plant for two years.A biography provided by his family said that Mr. Hinchey put himself through the State University of New York at New Paltz working as a night-shift toll collector on the New York State Thruway. He graduated in 1968.He also earned a master\u2019s degree at the university in 1970 and did advanced graduate work in public administration and economics at the State University of New York at Albany.Mr. Hinchey is survived by his wife, Ilene Marder Hinchey; his children, Michelle, Joseph and Reese Hinchey; his sister, Patricia; his brothers, Michael and John; and four grandchildren.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement on Wednesday that he had known Mr. Hinchey since the two served together in the State Assembly in the 1970s.\u201c \u2018Mighty Moe,\u2019 as I used to call him, was a man of great conviction, principle, endless energy and rare legislative ability,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, adding that Mr. Hinchey had been \u201cpassionately committed\u201d to preserving the \u201cpriceless open and wild spaces\u201d of the Hudson Valley and Southern Tier.Matthew Haag and Christopher Mele contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Nico Muhly\u2019s \u2018Marnie\u2019 Brings Hitchcock Into the 21st Century", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 How are we, late in 2017, to solve a problem like \u201cMarnie\u201d?It seems, in these troubled months after the Harvey Weinstein revelations, not pathologically frigid but, well, pretty normal for a woman not to want to be assaulted. \u201cHe\u2019ll never touch me,\u201d the opera\u2019s Marnie sings, with sober resolve. \u201cNot a nuzzle, not a grope, not a grab.\u201d We in the audience are put in the strange position of cheering that sentiment, even as the story tells us she desperately needs therapy for expressing it.And sure, Marnie steals, but what does this woman, who changes names and jobs every few months, represent more than our gig economy on steroids? Now that her so-called vices feel less abnormal than they must have in the 1960s, making drama of her is more difficult.To do so in opera would have required an antiheroine who was part Debussy\u2019s ambiguous, ambivalent M\u00e9lisande \u2014 whose first words, to the man who will become her husband, are \u201cDon\u2019t touch me\u201d \u2014 and part the imperious Emilia Marty in Janacek\u2019s \u201cMakropulos Case,\u201d who keeps trading identities to elude shadowy pursuers.If Marnie never comes theatrically to life like those two very different women, it may be because Debussy and Janacek\u2019s works are true music dramas, in which the characters develop and the plots advance through the music, not parallel to it. \u201cMarnie,\u201d with a libretto by the dramatist Nicholas Wright, too often feels like a play with noirish underscoring. The music isn\u2019t unrelated to what\u2019s happening on stage, but it feels supplementary rather than integral \u2014 decoration and mood setting rather than buttress.\u201cMarnie\u201d is more streamlined and straightforward, its pacing more assured and its characters more focused. The particulars of the plot are never in doubt; Mr. Mayer\u2019s production, with its candy-colored midcentury dresses and shifting panels, moves smoothly and stylishly. In the title role, the mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke sings with both warmth and a barely concealed backbone of steel, and projects ruefulness and the tiniest touch of humor.But the fundamental problem of \u201cTwo Boys\u201d is that of \u201cMarnie,\u201d too: a sense that atmosphere reigns over drama. Mr. Muhly\u2019s style is inherently restive \u2014 it\u2019s all unsettled motion, shot through with tender exhalations \u2014 but the sound world is so hyper-polished and unvarying that the restlessness feels paradoxically static.In a program note, Mr. Muhly speaks to the musical and emotional layers of his score, writing of one scene that Marnie \u201ccan sing the business-casual phrases required of her, chipper and practical, whereas in the pit, the solo oboe shows us that she is already trying to find a way out of that room as quickly as possible.\u201d This is doubtless all there, but those contrasts barely register for the listener, who hears mostly bland declamation, with pretty moodiness simmering below. Tension is telegraphed by a pristine mixture of yawning low instruments and eerie high glistening.This kind of prettiness might work in a three-minute song setting or a nine-minute concerto movement. But over two acts and 140 minutes, you sorely feel the lack of variety.\u201cMarnie\u201d does have moments of suggestive idiosyncrasy. A jagged violin solo as Marnie waits for her icy mother to come into the room is an economical evocation of a broken relationship and broken mind. An interlude of sour flutes captures just the way she feels about her husband\u2019s lecherous brother.It makes sense that Mr. Muhly, whose great passion is for the English church vocal tradition, gives Marnie a quartet of \u201cshadows,\u201d female singers who surround and sometimes echo her in the cool, vibratoless mode of a Renaissance madrigal. It\u2019s weird and memorable and only Mr. Muhly would have \u2014 could have \u2014 done it.But an earthshaking early chorus that tries to establish the high stakes of Marnie\u2019s endless escapes sounds like it\u2019s wandered in from the Verdi Requiem. \u201cJustice cannot be avoided,\u201d the singers scream. \u201cWhen will discovery come?\u201d Calm down, you want to shout back.Marnie has some aria-type monologues, but there is little opportunity for Ms. Cooke to depict the gap between reality and her character\u2019s self-understanding. One of the page-turning pleasures of the novel is how we see Marnie growing closer to her husband, Mark Rutland, before she does; in the opera their relationship never seems to deepen. The bass-baritone Daniel Okulitch, as Mark, sings robustly but is a cipher, leaving Marnie without a real foil.But that may be intentional: There appears to be little desire on the part of the creators for the opera\u2019s Mark to be the strange Svengali-Pygmalion figure \u2014 part hero, part villain, part weak, part strong \u2014 he is in the novel and film. Marnie doesn\u2019t need him when her latest reinvention is for our age of self-empowerment and self-actualization.\u201cI\u2019ll be there for myself,\u201d she sings at the very end, when Mark asks if she\u2019ll be there for him after, we presume, her stint in prison. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know for now.\u201dThis new identity \u2014 21st-century gal \u2014 is Marnie\u2019s least convincing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Lauds \u2018Great Relationship\u2019 With Duterte in Manila", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANILA \u2014 President Trump said on Monday that he had a \u201cgreat relationship\u201d with President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, making little mention of human rights at his first face-to-face meeting with an authoritarian leader accused of carrying out a campaign of extrajudicial killings in his nation\u2019s war on drugs.In a stark break from past practice by American presidents, who have pressed foreign leaders publicly and privately about allegations of human rights abuses, Mr. Trump instead pursued his own transactional style of diplomacy, dwelling mostly on areas of common ground during his meeting with Mr. Duterte. On the sideline of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit meeting, Mr. Trump focused on combating the Islamic State and illegal drugs as well as on trade issues, the White House said.\u201cHuman rights briefly came up in the context of the Philippines\u2019 fight against illegal drugs,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.But Mr. Duterte\u2019s spokesman denied that the subject of rights was ever broached, even as the Philippine president spoke about the \u201cdrug menace\u201d in his country.Mr. Trump \u201cappeared sympathetic and did not have any official position on the matter and was merely nodding his head, indicating that he understood the domestic problem that we faced on drugs,\u201d said Harry Roque, Mr. Duterte\u2019s spokesman. \u201cThe issue of human rights did not arise; it was not brought up.\u201dThe two presidents declined to answer questions during brief remarks to reporters at the start of the meeting. As they sat side by side, Mr. Trump and Mr. Duterte projected a friendly dynamic, ribbing members of the news media as they prepared to speak privately.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a great relationship,\u201d Mr. Trump said, heaping praise on Mr. Duterte\u2019s stewardship of the summit, including an elaborate gala dinner on Sunday where they were seen chatting animatedly and a set of cultural performances on Monday. \u201cThis has been very successful.\u201dAs journalists shouted questions about whether Mr. Trump would press Mr. Duterte on human rights, the Philippine president quickly silenced them.\u201cWhoa, whoa \u2014 this is not the press statement,\u201d Mr. Duterte said. \u201cWe are in a bilateral meeting.\u201d\u201cYou are the spies,\u201d he told the reporters, as Philippine security personnel jostled some of them roughly. The remarks elicited a hearty laugh from Mr. Trump before the journalists were led out of the room.On the streets of Manila, meanwhile, a phalanx of about a hundred riot police officers with shields and truncheons clashed Monday with about 300 protesters as they marched near the American Embassy.The protesters carried anti-American placards and a likeness of Mr. Trump with a Hitler-like mustache. They were later pushed back with water cannons.White House officials have said that Mr. Trump has a \u201cwarm rapport\u201d with Mr. Duterte, with whom he has spoken and exchanged letters since taking office, and that he wants to mend the American-Philippine alliance after strains during the Obama administration.\u201cPresident Trump specifically said he has always been a friend of the Duterte administration, unlike the previous administrations of the United States,\u201d Mr. Roque said on Monday. \u201cHe stressed that he can be counted upon as a friend of the Duterte administration.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s encounter earlier in the day with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia was somewhat scratchier, albeit in a mostly playful way. As the two leaders stood alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, Mr. Trump repeated his vow to eliminate trade deficits that he said the United States ran with \u201calmost everybody.\u201d\u201cExcept us,\u201d Mr. Turnbull interjected.\u201cExcept with you,\u201d Mr. Trump agreed, to titters in the room. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one. And if I check it, I\u2019ll probably find out that was \u2026\u201d\u201cOh, no,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said. \u201cIt\u2019s real.\u201dThe United States, in fact, has run a $10.3 billion trade surplus with Australia in the nine months of this year and has consistently exported more to Australia than it has imported for the last decade.Trump administration officials have said Mr. Trump wants to improve relations with the Philippines as a bulwark against China\u2019s expansionism in the South China Sea. The Philippines has clashed with China over disputed reefs and shoals in the waterway, which the two countries share, and Mr. Trump has used this month\u2019s Asia tour to offer to, as he said on Sunday in Hanoi, \u201cmediate or arbitrate\u201d such disagreements.But neither side mentioned the issue in their readouts of the meeting on Monday, and Mr. Duterte has played down the disputes this week, saying that China\u2019s rapidly expanding economy has overtaken that of the United States and that a territorial confrontation would not be worthwhile.\u201cToday, China is the No. 1 economic powerhouse, and we have to be friends,\u201d Mr. Duterte told Asean leaders on Sunday.He said that while \u201cthe other hotheads\u201d would like confrontation, \u201cthe South China Sea is better left untouched.\u201d\u201cNobody can afford to go to war,\u201d Mr. Duterte added, including Russia, China, Britain and the United States.Felipe Villamor and Mark Landler contributed reporting from Manila, and Richard C.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Revealing Spin on the \u2018Sharing Economy\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyFor decades after its Communist revolution in 1949, China was known as \u201cthe kingdom of bicycles.\u201d The one-speed Flying Pigeons that swarmed the streets were not simply a cheap mode of transportation. They were symbols of a shared aspiration. Along with a radio, a watch and a sewing machine, a bicycle was one of four possessions \u2014 known as sanzhuan yixiang, or \u201cthree rounds and sound\u201d \u2014 that urban Chinese families felt they needed to be part of the modern world. By the time I joined the masses in 2001, cycling across Beijing for daily Mandarin classes, cars had begun to displace bicycles. Pedaling alongside my fellow commuters \u2014 students, workers, pensioners \u2014 I felt part of a communal experience that might soon be gone forever.I was wrong, of course. China\u2019s cities are suddenly teeming with bicycles, and the humble one-speed, that remnant of China\u2019s collective memory, again serves as more than just a means of conveyance. It is now a digital device too, helping shape one of China\u2019s most dynamic growth engines \u2014 the so-called sharing economy. Three years ago, bike-sharing didn\u2019t exist in China. Today more than 40 companies offer the service. And the top two alone, Mobike and Ofo, handle more than 50 million rides every day, solving the \u201clast mile\u201d problem of getting people from public transportation to their homes.China\u2019s bike-sharing explosion is driven by digital innovations that make renting \u201cdockless\u201d bikes easy, cheap and completely cool. All it takes is a smartphone: to find the nearest bike via GPS, to scan its QR code and open its smartlocks and to pay a minuscule fee (usually 15 cents or less per ride) through a mobile-payment app. At the end, the bikes can be left almost anywhere. (In the United States, bicycles often need to be picked up and returned to a fixed dock, as with New York\u2019s Citi Bike.) For a generation of consumers conditioned to adapt to new things, the draw is no longer the pride of ownership but has become convenience and cachet. For the companies and, more pointedly, the Chinese government, the potential windfall comes not so much from profits, which remain elusive, but from the consumer data produced by every transaction.The state-run press agency, Xinhua, has trumpeted bike-sharing as one of China\u2019s \u201cfour great new inventions.\u201d (The other three are mobile payments, e-commerce and high-speed rail.) It may sound absurd to compare a dockless bike to the world-changing inventions of China\u2019s past: paper, gunpowder, the compass and movable type. But the boast conveys the importance that Beijing assigns the \u201csharing economy\u201d in helping China make the leap from a manufacturing-based to a service-oriented economy. Last year, according to government figures, China\u2019s sharing economy accounted for more than $500 billion in transactions involving roughly 600 million people. (An estimated 55 million Americans will use a sharing service this year, according to a CBS report.) And with Beijing planning on an annual 40 percent growth rate, officials are commanding this new economic engine to account for 10 percent of the national gross domestic product by 2020 and 20 percent by 2025.In this frenzy, investors have thrown millions of dollars at almost any venture with a \u201csharing\u201d label, from basketballs and refrigerators to luxury handbags and phone chargers. Not all the ideas fare well. The Shared Girlfriend sex-doll service, for example, was shut down in September in response to a public outcry. The police also forced a Beijing company to stop renting out \u201cnapping capsules,\u201d condemning them as fire hazards. Other ideas, on closer inspection, hardly look innovative. The \u201cshared bookstore\u201d is really just a lending library. And the \u201cshared washing-machine service\u201d \u2014 isn\u2019t that a laundromat?China\u2019s sharing economy has veered sharply away from how the term was originally defined: as a peer-to-peer exchange of underutilized goods and services. In China, \u201csharing\u201d now means almost any short-term rental of a product or service activated by a smartphone. Moreover, the things on offer, like Ofo\u2019s 6.5 million bikes, are not spread out among individuals but are owned by the tech companies themselves. The same is true for the spoils, from revenue to data. As a result, the ideals that still animate the concept in many other places \u2014 the reallocation of unused resources and the community that forms around it \u2014 are essentially absent in China. \u201cI was thrilled when I first heard China was so committed to the sharing economy,\u201d says April Rinne, an adviser who is a member of China\u2019s National Sharing Economy Commission. \u201cBut it\u2019s all so transactional, and the definition of sharing has gotten so broad that it\u2019s almost meaningless. As China defines it, even Amazon would be part of the sharing economy.\u201dWho can blame China for hanging on to the term \u201csharing economy\u201d? It fits with the image that Beijing wants to project: warm, generous, egalitarian. Robin Li, the chief executive of the internet giant Baidu, said last year that \u201cthe idea of a sharing economy is quite similar to that of a communist society,\u201d because both focus on \u201cdistribution according to need.\u201d A strategic planner at the advertising firm Havas Worldwide waxed so rhapsodic in a commentary about \u201cthe close-knit comradeship\u201d of Chinese consumers that it seemed the idea of sharing was itself a Chinese invention. \u201cThere is almost a sense of nobility garnered by having the means to own something yet deciding to share instead,\u201d the author wrote. The prize for puffery, however, goes to The People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, which in August celebrated umbrella-sharing enterprises as \u201ca show of human care, releasing the warmth of the city.\u201d A few weeks after that, nearly all 300,000 umbrellas distributed by a new company called Sharing E Umbrella had been either lost or stolen.None of China\u2019s bike-sharing companies are turning a profit yet. But even as they fight for market share, the data is the destination. \u201cCollecting data is the first goal of the sharing economy,\u201d says William Chou, the head of Deloitte\u2019s telecoms, media and technology practice in China. Every time consumers scan the QR code on a bicycle \u2014 or basketball, handbag, umbrella \u2014 they provide information about habits, locations, behaviors and payment histories. That\u2019s invaluable not just to Tencent and Alibaba but also to city planners seeking precise information about where to build roads, bridges and subways. \u201cThe fight is no longer over who has the biggest fleet,\u201d Towson says, \u201cbut who has the smartest fleet.\u201dThose are the benign side-effects of the sharing economy. But what happens as this data filters into China\u2019s new social-credit system, which promises to rate every individual by her financial, social and political worth? In fact, Beijing has authorized Tencent and Alibaba to conduct social-credit pilot testing, and their bikes serve as the perfect vehicles. There are no walls of privacy. The government has the ability to access company data, good or bad, faster than you can scan a QR code.One morning recently in Shanghai, I caught a glimpse of some suspicious behavior. I was walking down a tranquil, tree-lined street when a muscular man lumbered past carrying two orange-and-silver Mobikes. As he swept by, a wheel touched the ground and set off an alarm, causing him to heave the bikes even higher in the air. The man was not a bike enthusiast, but he wasn\u2019t a thief, either. As I watched him slip down a side alley and emerge moments later empty-handed, I realized that he was a foot soldier in the bike-sharing wars, dumping competitors\u2019 bikes in hard-to-find places. Rounding the corner, I saw the result of his handiwork: a sea of bikes in almost every hue. Yet not a single orange-and-silver Mobike was in sight.An earlier version of this article transliterated incorrectly a Chinese term that means \u201cthree rounds and sound.\u201d That term is sanzhuan yixiang, not sanshengyixiang.Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Will Justices Change That?", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThe benefits of stopping bad patents from snaking their way through the economy have been even greater.\u201cIt probably hasn\u2019t made patent trolls go away, but it\u2019s changed their demands,\u201d noted Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University. \u201cNow they sue and ask for $50,000 rather than sue and ask for $1 million.\u201dAfter years of aggressive intellectual-property claims, experts argue that the new panel is helping to push patent law in a much-needed direction: to relax its stifling effects on the economy.\u201cAt a high level, we have made an impressive amount of progress over the last five to 10 years in getting the patent system more into balance,\u201d said Carl Shapiro, an expert on competition policy at the University of California, Berkeley.But for all the benefits of culling faulty intellectual-property rights, the board is under existential threat. Next week, the Supreme Court will hear a challenge that the patent office\u2019s new procedure is unconstitutional because invalidating a patent amounts to an unlawful takeover of private property.It\u2019s hard to tell how the Supreme Court will rule. Patents are not standard-issue private property, like a plot of land. They are granted by the government to encourage innovation, a public good, because inventors might not invent without a period of exclusivity over the fruits of their idea.Beyond the constitutional questions, I would suggest to the justices on the court that they consider the ramifications of their decision on the United States economy.Charging royalties for ideas that are obvious or were concocted so long ago that they are already in the public domain \u2014 like making a call by touching numbers on your smartphone screen, or fastening your trousers with a zipper \u2014 exact a cost but provide no benefit. Striking down a bad patent is less about confiscating property than about discovering that the property right should not have been awarded in the first place.The patents Teva was trying to uphold, which the patent office tribunal shot down, were designed not to establish its exclusive rights over a new technology but to prolong its exclusive rights to an old one. Its case is not unusual: Researchers are finding that more and more pharmaceutical companies are recycling and repurposing old medicines rather than inventing new ones.Here\u2019s how it works: Pharmaceutical companies start moving doctors to the tweaked formulation before the initial patent runs out, so that by the time it expires nobody is prescribing the original drug. That gives them an extra 20 years of exclusivity in which they can charge patients and their insurance companies exorbitant fees. Society has nothing to gain.Tahir Amin, a co-executive director of the initiative, added that \u201cthere are a lot of patent trolls trying to extort rents from low-quality patents.\u201dThe Supreme Court has in recent years shown itself sympathetic to the argument that patent protections have become too restrictive. On half a dozen occasions since 2013, it has overturned decisions by Federal District Courts granting patent rights over what were ultimately fairly intuitive processes.Corporate interests are not aligned in this case, though. Pharmaceutical companies despise the patent office\u2019s new powers. Information-technology corporations, which incorporate thousands of ideas into one gadget and see themselves as victims of patent trolls, are strong supporters of this relatively cheap and expedient avenue to challenge patents once they have been written.The Goliaths of technology are, of course, out for themselves alone. Yet in this case they are aligned with the economy\u2019s interest. For too long, innovation has been narrowed to fit patent holders\u2019 argument for sacrosanct property rights. For these rights to hold, however, at the very least we need a system to undo those that prove to be invalid.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "C.E.O. Deficit Fears Dissolve With the Prospect of Corporate Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookIn mid-October 2012, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, hosted a luncheon on the 49th floor of the firm\u2019s Park Avenue headquarters. The guest list was a boldface roll call of corporate executives and policymakers: Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, David M. Cote of Honeywell, the Democratic senator Mark Warner of Virginia and the Republican senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, among others.The topic over lunch was \u201cFix the Debt,\u201d a nascent effort by like-minded executives \u2014 all of whom had signed on to the campaign \u2014 to urge lawmakers to address the nation\u2019s growing debt. Erskine Bowles, the former chief of staff for President Bill Clinton who was an inspiration for the group along with Alan Simpson, the former Republican senator from Wyoming, had just called the nation\u2019s debt \u201ca cancer that will destroy this country from within.\u201dMr. Dimon, along with dozens of other executives, took up the challenge. \u201cThe inability to face our fiscal reality is a concern,\u201d he wrote in his annual letter to investors that year, lamenting the failure to adopt the Simpson-Bowles plan to reduce the debt by $4 trillion, in part by increasing taxes, closing loopholes and reducing entitlements. \u201cI believe that if we had adopted some form of the Simpson-Bowles plan to fix the debt, it would have been extremely beneficial to the economy.\u201dFast forward to this month: With a few exceptions, the community of chief executives that once championed reducing the debt as the nation\u2019s top priority is taking up a position on the other side of the issue. They are advocating an overhaul package that will reduce corporate taxes, even though both the House and Senate plans will increase the national debt by an estimated $1.5 trillion over the next decade.You\u2019ve heard nary a peep from the business community about that. The silence is deafening.\u201cPassing tax reform is the single most important thing that Congress can do to make American companies more competitive, boost the economy, create jobs and spur wage growth,\u201d Mr. Dimon, who is also the chairman of the Business Roundtable, which represents some of the largest companies in the nation, said in a statement this month. \u201cThe House and Senate continue to move forward to deliver tax relief for hard-working American families, and business leaders will continue to advocate for comprehensive pro-growth reform.\u201dHe is hardly alone in his support for the tax plan. Hundreds of chief executives have come out in favor of the proposal, which, among other things, will reduce the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, from 35 percent, as well as allow multinational businesses to repatriate income from abroad at a one-time rate of only 12 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s not completely irrational to say the tax code is a disaster,\u201d Mr. Rattner said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here is that the importance of reforming the tax code trumps, excuse the pun, fixing the debt.\u201dMr. Rattner said that for many chief executives, \u201cthe choice is between this and no tax bill.\u201d In other words, there is not another option on the table, nor is there one on the horizon. Still, Mr. Rattner said he could not support the current tax overhaul plan.In fairness, the position of Mr. Dimon and others may not be completely at odds with their previous views. Despite the stated goal of the Fix the Debt campaign five years ago, insiders say it was as much a rallying cry for Washington to come together on financial policy as it was about immediately addressing the debt. And much of the campaign was predicated on meaningful corporate tax reform and spending.Chief executives like Mr. Dimon and Mr. Cote offered to pay higher individual tax rates \u2014 which the Simpson-Bowles plan called for \u2014 but significantly cutting corporate taxes was always a central tenet of the \u201cfix the debt\u201d effort. And with the current tax plan, Mr. Dimon and others have not taken a public position on anything but the corporate tax reduction element; they have not spoken out about the individual rate or other elements.Only a handful of public company executives have raised questions about the viability of the tax plan and its impact on the long-term fiscal health of the economy. One of them is Howard Schultz, executive chairman of Starbucks, who told me two weeks ago: \u201cIf you talk about tax reform, which is in the news every minute of every day, this is not tax reform. This is fool\u2019s gold.\u201dWhen I asked him about Mr. Dimon\u2019s support for the tax plan, he said: \u201cHe\u2019s a lot smarter than me, but I don\u2019t agree with him.\u201dPeter Peterson, the co-founder of the Blackstone Group and the founder of the Peterson Foundation, which has long campaigned against the growing national debt, had some harsh words for his peers who had turned away from \u201crevenue neutral policy.\u201d\u201cMortgaging our fiscal future for trillions in temporary tax cuts will hurt our economy over time, and every C.E.O. should know that,\u201d he said. \u201cTrue business patriots need to advocate for their country as well as their company.\u201dIn the end, Mr. Peterson is right. The country \u2014 and businesses \u2014 will ultimately do better if the nation\u2019s balance sheet is not bloated with debt. Part of the issue is generating enough revenue from taxes, and part is dealing with costs like health care and entitlements, which the tax overhaul plan does not even begin to tackle.In the meantime, it would be nice to see more chief executives articulate the message that they were so vocal about years ago when they spoke about the importance of ensuring the long-term economic health of the country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Thailand Takes Pride in the Vietnam War", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67Fifty years ago last month, the first Thai volunteer soldiers, a regiment-size unit called the Queen\u2019s Cobras, were sent off to Bien Hoa in South Vietnam to fight alongside the Americans as part of the so-called Free World Forces. Eventually some 40,000 Thai soldiers and sailors would serve. While the Vietnam War is remembered rightly as a tragedy in both the United States and Vietnam, the same cannot be said for Thailand. There the war is described by participants, military histories and official monuments in largely upbeat terms.In the early 2000s, I interviewed more than 60 Thai Vietnam War veterans from that original group and its successor, a division-size unit known as the Black Panthers. They repeatedly stressed the experiential and material gains the war had given them. They talked about how their service had successfully blocked the spread of communism to Thailand. They marveled at how much Thailand had changed during the war years. And while they acknowledged the war\u2019s terrible toll on people throughout Southeast Asia, including some of their fellow soldiers, they mostly talked about how the war had helped them and their nation. What really struck me, though, was the pride they took in their self-image as Buddhist soldiers.\u201cThai Buddha, No. 1!\u201d I heard that phrase, originally blurted out in pidgin by American servicemen upon meeting Thai soldiers, time after time in my interviews. Most Thai combat soldiers wore numerous Buddhist amulets into battle. The more devout wore dozens in crisscrossing strings around their torsos. These Thai troops harbored great faith in the amulets\u2019 protective power, saying the charms could bend the path of enemy bullets around their bodies or throw up a force field to blunt the blast of an anti-personnel mine. They took the Americans\u2019 enthusiasm for this prodigious display as evidence of the Buddhist amulets\u2019 superiority over similar Christian charms such as a cross or a St. Christopher medal. And they happily shared their amulets with any American who asked for one.Some felt that the charms focused their minds in a firefight; the Buddha was a paragon whose mastery of meditative calm in the face of Mara\u2019s devilish army would help them avoid fear and panic. Buddhist statues accompanied Thai troops in armored personnel carriers and trucks. Many Thai soldiers volunteered during off days to clean and repair abandoned Vietnamese temples. They cited \u201cmetta,\u201d the Buddhist impulse toward loving kindness, as the source of this civic action. The Thai troops saw themselves as Theravada Buddhist warriors on a sacred mission to protect their neighboring Mahayanist Buddhist country.The first Thais set off for South Vietnam after spectacular farewell ceremonies conducted in Bangkok\u2019s most hallowed locations. They took oaths before the altar of Thailand\u2019s most sacred Buddhist icon, the Wat Phra Kaew, or Emerald Buddha. Senior Buddhist monks blessed their passing ranks as they marched before tens of thousands of cheering spectators. Crowds jammed Bangkok\u2019s Khlong Toei Port to see the soldiers off.During the first years of their commitment, from 1967 to 1969, a time when the American public was turning rapidly against the war, the Thai press carried laudatory reports of the Thai troops\u2019 great battlefield successes. Thailand\u2019s king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, brought gifts to the first wounded volunteers repatriated to Thai hospitals. And the monarch, enormously popular during this period, oversaw the first military funerals at palace-sponsored Buddhist temples.By all accounts, the Thai troops fought well. From their base at Bear Cat Camp in Bien Hoa Province, they clashed with the Viet Cong in medium and small engagements along the vital National Route 15 linking the port of Vung Tau to areas surrounding Saigon. Thai newspapers of the day reported the successes in impressive ratios of enemy soldiers to Thai dead that looked like winning tallies of a sports score, such as \u201cIn 150 Fights, 100 [Thais] Are Dead, 1000 Viet Cong Are Killed.\u201d Many veterans recalled how even Gen. William C. Westmoreland, commander of the Military Assistance Command \u2014 Vietnam, praised them.The pride was cultural, too, a sign that their country had made it onto the world stage. Thai soldiers recall the Vietnam War as a yearlong opportunity to observe the American-style consumerism that would influence Thailand in the 1970s, \u201980s and \u201990s. The soldiers delighted in the affordable American consumer goods they encountered in the military post exchanges, or PXs. They saved up their pay to buy their first SLR cameras, televisions, refrigerators, stereo systems, champagne, Scotch and Playboy magazines.This focus on materialism would taint their reputation. The zest with which Thai soldiers sought American goods at the PX stores caught the attention of international journalists. Reports describing the Thai soldiers\u2019 involvement in schemes to sell PX goods to Saigon\u2019s black market appeared in the American press, including in The New York Times. In the early 1970s, during the Senate\u2019s Foreign Relations subcommittee hearings into the Vietnam War, it was revealed that the United States was paying the full cost of Thailand\u2019s deployment. This revelation and the negative PX reports contributed to the Thai troops\u2019 reputation in some histories as \u201cAmerica\u2019s mercenaries.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t entirely off base. Thailand was a significant beneficiary of American largess during the Vietnam War years. Its military-dominated government had been a stalwart ally of the United States from the earliest days of the Cold War, and had committed its territory, people and resources to the American-led campaign against Hanoi and its allies. In return the United States poured $1.1 billion in economic and military aid into Thailand; the United States Agency for International Development gave an additional $530 million.Thailand hosted seven air bases that launched American military aircraft daily on missions to strike strategic targets in Laos, North Vietnam and South Vietnam. The United States funded the rapid expansion of a naval base and port facilities that brought war-related supplies into the region. At the height of the war, some 50,000 American military personnel were stationed throughout Thailand. Thai entrepreneurs, many with connections to the government, built scores of new hotels, restaurants and bars to serve the waves of free-spending American G.I.s visiting on R&R. The G.I.s added $111 million to the Thai economy. At the war\u2019s end, Thailand kept all of this military equipment and infrastructure. The Buddhist kingdom saw itself rapidly modernized thanks to the war.The \u201cmercenary\u201d tag has done little to harm the soldiers\u2019 reputation at home. Thailand\u2019s official memorials to its Vietnam War veterans laud battlefield success, military professionalism and honor. The Thai Vietnam War Veterans Memorial in Kanchanaburi evokes the more famous World War II-era monument in Bangkok called Victory Monument. Its bas-relief images show well-armed Thai troops defeating ragtag Viet Cong guerrillas. The Royal Thai Army counts the Vietnam War as one of its proudest moments of the 20th century. The dioramas and displays in the official National Memorial Museum outside Bangkok show Thai troops killing their communist foes in arrangements that stress the successful defense of Thailand.Less evident today is the terrible cost that Thailand paid for its involvement in the war. In addition to the 351 killed in action and the 1,351 wounded in Vietnam, Thailand sent volunteer troops to Laos in the so-called Secret War, many of whom fought and died under terrible conditions. The Vietnam War and the presence of American military personnel played a role in inciting episodes of political violence in the mid-1970s, notably the horrific massacres of student demonstrators by troops, police officers and vigilante gangs in 1973 and 1976.Bangkok\u2019s notorious red-light districts catering to Western sex tourists trace their origins to the R&R visits by American troops. Some of these soldiers left behind unacknowledged offspring from short-term relationships with Thai women; many of these children were raised in poverty and ostracization. But these events \u2014 and especially their connection to the war \u2014 are largely elided from Thailand\u2019s official memorials and histories.It would be hard, however, to fault Thailand and its Vietnam War veterans for seeing the war as a kind of national success. In the two decades after Hanoi\u2019s capture of Saigon, a unified Vietnam endured warfare, poverty and isolation. The most common images of Vietnam in this period were those of desperate seaborne refugees \u2014 the Vietnamese boat people \u2014 who risked their lives to escape the deprivation and harassment in the postwar period.In that same period that Vietnam suffered, Thailand saw foreign investment soar. American-built highways now linked rural areas to Bangkok and regional capitals. The rice-growing countryside added factories and processing plants in a spate of rapid industrialization. The former R&R infrastructure left over from the war became the basis of a world-famous tourist industry that has grown enormously since the mid-1970s; this year foreign tourists are expected to add nearly $50 billion to the Thai economy. For all of the downsides that Thailand found in being America\u2019s ally in a losing effort, it can legitimately claim, as it does in its monuments, command histories and veterans\u2019 memories, that it came out of the Vietnam War a winner.Richard A.

{"Headline": "Whatever Happened to Trump\u2019s Populist Agenda?", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPresident Trump accomplished his unlikely rise to the White House powered in large part by an embrace of economic and cultural populism. Yet one year after this victory, the Republican Party still has no idea how to address or incorporate those populist elements into a coherent agenda. Nor, despite their best intentions, do Mr. Trump and his former adviser Steve Bannon.This populism does not sit easily within the Republican Party\u2019s business conservative wing (think Mitt Romney) or its \u201cliberty\u201d conservatives (think Tea Party) faction. So it\u2019s not too surprising that virtually all of Mr. Trump\u2019s signature populist ideas have been watered down or ignored, or are in limbo. Instead, Republicans push tax plans that overwhelmingly benefit their donor and executive class. It\u2019s as though Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz won after all.But they didn\u2019t win, and they didn\u2019t win for a reason. Republican voters want something different from anti-government or establishment Republicanism. And the voters who made Mr. Trump president, the millions of largely white men and women without college degrees who voted for Barack Obama before backing Mr. Trump, definitely do not want Romneyism with a human face.The traditional Republican policy agenda is a political zombie, a relic that once served our nation well but is out of touch with what Americans want today. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Mr. Trump and some of his supporters had good ideas for a reformed Republican Party that fuses conservative and populist elements into an alloy stronger than either on its own.This fusion may now seem like a dream, but it can still walk among us if Republicans will it to be so. They need only look back to the man they purport to revere, Ronald Reagan, to make it happen.We tend to forget that the Reagan coalition of the same three groups \u2014 non-Republican populists, fiscal conservatives and business Republicans \u2014 united behind coherent policy change.American jobs for American citizens also needs to become more than a slogan. The new tax bill should include provisions that give employers credits in addition to the current deduction for employee compensation to legal United States residents. A second provision should provide additional tax credits for wage increases above national averages for workers earning below-average wages.Entitlement reform, a holy grail for both traditional Republican factions, can also be addressed with populist priorities in mind. Mr. Reagan always supported the principles of Social Security and Medicare; what he objected to was giving federal aid to people who didn\u2019t need it, like those who could provide for themselves in their old age. Business and liberty conservatives who are concerned about runaway entitlement spending should propose reforms that place the fiscal burden on those who can best bear it, like retirees with large 401(k) accounts.Entitlement reform must also address the perverse policies that keep less-skilled workers trapped in low-growth regions. Medicaid recipients today, for example, are required to reapply for health insurance if they move to another state. Who would risk the family\u2019s health insurance to move for a $10-an-hour job? Medicaid recipients should be able to keep their current state\u2019s plan, at the federal government\u2019s expense, for a few months if they have or are looking for a job in a new state.Mr. Trump\u2019s attempted populist revolution is so far merely a ruckus, not a revolt. The Washington establishment\u2019s agenda remains unshaken. Whether it remains so depends on whether Republicans and Trump populists realize in time that they must hang together and develop a new conservative-populist economic agenda. If they don\u2019t, they will learn that they will all hang separately.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Upstart Saudi Prince Who\u2019s Throwing Caution to the Winds", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 With the tacit backing of his father, Saudi Arabia\u2019s 32-year-old crown prince has established himself as the most powerful figure in the Arab world, rushing into confrontations on all sides at once.The crown prince has moved so quickly that American officials and others worry that he is destabilizing the region. Signs of potential blowback are growing.Investors, nervous about his plans, have been moving money out of the kingdom. Prince Mohammed has sought to counter the capital flight by squeezing detainees and others to surrender assets. He has presented the arrests as a campaign against corruption, but his targets call it a shakedown, and he has turned for advice to a former Egyptian security chief who has been pilloried at home for brutality and graft.Prince Mohammed\u2019s supporters say he is simply taking the drastic measures needed to turn around the kingdom\u2019s graft-ridden and oil-dependent economy while pushing back against Iranian aggression.But analysts around the region debate whether the headlong rush might be driven more by a desire to consolidate power before a possible royal succession, desperation for cash to pay for his plans or simply unchecked ambition to put his stamp on the broader Middle East. And despite President Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for the prince, some in the State Department, the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies say they fear that his impulsiveness could both set back his own goals and destabilize the region.\u201cHe\u2019s decided he doesn\u2019t do anything cautiously,\u201d said Philip Gordon, the White House Middle East coordinator under President Barack Obama. But, Mr. Gordon said, \u201cif the crown prince alienates too many other princes and other pillars of the regime, pursues costly regional conflicts and scares off foreign investors, he could undermine the prospects for the very reforms he is trying to implement.\u201dThe extrajudicial arrests have spooked investors enough, analysts say, to extinguish the prince\u2019s plans for an public stock offering of Aramco, the Saudi state oil company, in New York or London next year. It had been a centerpiece of his overhaul.The crown prince\u2019s threats against Iran and Lebanon have raised the specter of wars that the Saudi military, already bogged down in Yemen, is ill-equipped to fight. Riyadh would be forced to depend on the United States or Israel in any new conflict.His corruption purge at home, meanwhile, risks alienating parts of the royal family and the financial elite at a moment that would appear to demand unity, either to smooth a succession or to face off against Iran. As many as 17 people detained in the anti-corruption campaign have required medical treatment for abuse by their captors, according to a doctor from the nearest hospital and an American official tracking the situation.Officials of the Saudi Royal Court referred press queries about these reports to the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Washington, where a spokeswoman, Fatimah Baeshen, said the embassy could not confirm or dispute them.With the decline in the price of oil in recent years, Saudi Arabia has frozen projects and spent more than a third of its financial reserves, draining them to about $475 billion this fall from a peak of $737 billion in August 2014. At that burn rate, the kingdom has only a few years to lift its revenue or slash its spending to forestall a financial crisis.Against that backdrop, the prince\u2019s supporters argue that the anti-corruption campaign aims to recapture hundreds of billions of dollars that have leaked from the state budget through graft and self-dealing \u2014 money he needs to fund his development plans.Prince Mohammed had appealed to the kingdom\u2019s wealthy for months to invest in his modernization program. But some groused that his plans \u2014 like a new $500 billion business hub \u201cfor the dreamers of the world,\u201d built from scratch and fueled entirely by clean energy \u2014 were ill-conceived and grandiose, and instead of investing at home they quietly moved their assets abroad.Now, he is no longer merely asking. The Saudi government is pressing some of those detained and others still at large to sign over large sums in exchange for better treatment, according to an American official briefed on the crackdown and associates of the royal family. Employees of some of those arrested had been summoned months before to answer questions about their bosses, a sign that the purge was planned well in advance.A senior Saudi official defending the crackdown said this week that it was meant to show that the old rules of business in the kingdom had changed.\u201cCorruption is at every level, and there are hundreds of billions of riyals that are lost from the national economy every year,\u201d the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive government matters. \u201cThe point here was mainly to shock the system, to send a message that this will not be tolerated anymore and that nobody is immune.\u201dCorruption has been so endemic for so long \u2014 from inflated government contracts for large projects to simple bribes to obtain passports \u2014 that countless Saudis have participated. Yet, some princes with reputations for conspicuous corruption appear to have been left alone, raising questions about who is being targeted, and why.That display of his continued popularity, however, may have been too much for the younger Prince Mohammed, who the next day ordered the seizure of the former crown prince\u2019s assets, along with those of his wife and daughters, according to two family associates.Ms. Baeshen, the Saudi embassy spokeswoman, said she could not comment on any potential investigations.Some American officials suspect that Prince Mohammed may be rushing to lock down the levers of power in anticipation of a formal abdication by his father, King Salman, who scholars and Western officials say could be suffering from dementia.When President Trump visited Riyadh for a summit meeting last summer, the king remained seated as he struggled to read a prepared statement. His speech was at times weak, halting or slurred. He seldom speaks publicly. Saudi officials, however, insist his mental capacities are sound.Prince Mohammed\u2019s supporters argue that Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent threats against Iran and Lebanon came in response to provocations beyond his control. As he was preparing his anti-corruption roundup, they say, Tehran\u2019s allies in Yemen launched an Iranian-made missile in the direction of Riyadh, where it was intercepted over the outskirts of the city. The Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, resigned his position the same day with a televised speech from Riyadh that accused Iran and its Lebanese client Hezbollah of sowing \u201cdiscord, devastation and destruction\u201d in the region.But many, including current and former American diplomats, say Prince Mohammed\u2019s boldness also reflects his conviction that he has the support of Mr. Trump.Even in the last days of the Obama administration, another Persian Gulf royal who had already forged deep ties around Washington, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi began to promote his Saudi counterpart to the incoming Trump team as a useful ally. Both princes appear to have formed a particular bond with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, who at 36 is a contemporary of the young Saudi prince.Mr. Trump chose Saudi Arabia for the first foreign trip of his presidency, and Prince Mohammed and Mr. Kushner have built such a strong rapport that other American officials say they are not briefed on what the two discuss.\u201cJared is a bit of a black hole,\u201d said one State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss frustration with the White House. \u201cThere is no sense of the positions he has advocated. We can only guess, based on what he has done and where he has been.\u201dThe official added: \u201cThe Emiratis and the Saudis have been very careful to cultivate him and bring him along\u201d toward their \u201cconfrontational posture in the region.\u201dA White House official who also insisted on anonymity disputed the characterization of Mr. Kushner, saying he regularly briefed the State Department and National Security Council on his trips and conversations.\u201cI have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing,\u201d President Trump said on Twitter after the arrests had begun. \u201cSome of those they are harshly treating have been \u2018milking\u2019 their country for years.\u201dMs. Baeshen, the embassy spokeswoman, said that Saudi Arabia and the United States \u201cenjoy a wide range of cooperative discussions\u201d but that \u201cdomestic affairs are just that: domestic affairs.\u201dThe State Department official, though, said that its diplomats, the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency all felt \u201cgrowing alarm\u201d that Prince Mohammed \u201cis behaving recklessly without sufficient consideration to the likely consequences of his behavior, and that has the potential to damage U.S. interests.\u201dBen Hubbard reported from Riyadh, and David D. Kirkpatrick from London. Reporting was contributed by Peter Baker and Eric Schmitt from Washington, and Declan Walsh and Nour Youssef from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Good Choice for the Fed. But if Only \u2026", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMr. Powell appears to share Ms. Yellen\u2019s view that while the economy has improved a lot in recent years, the time is not right for the Fed to raise interest rates rapidly and substantially. He is a far better choice than other candidates Mr. Trump was said to be considering. They included critics of the Fed who claimed in the wake of the 2008 crisis that the central bank was sowing the seeds for out-of-control inflation. (Almost a decade later there is still no sign of that.) Other potential nominees have advocated for the deregulation of banks, which could imperil the financial system.It is not entirely clear how the Fed under Mr. Powell \u2014 assuming he is confirmed, as is likely \u2014 will approach the bank\u2019s regulatory mission. He appears to favor some deregulation, experts say, but not a wholesale discarding of the post-crisis regulatory framework put in place under the Dodd-Frank law in the Bernanke and Yellen years.Having joined the Fed\u2019s board when the economy was still limping, Mr. Powell is surely aware of the dangers of returning banking to the bad old days that led to the devastating financial crisis of 2008. Senators ought to press him during his confirmation hearings about where he stands on questions like whether the Fed should reduce the reserves that banks are required to have on hand. (It should not.) And they ought to hold Mr. Trump\u2019s other nominees to the Fed board to the same tough scrutiny.Mr. Trump clearly chose Mr. Powell in part because he did not want to scare investors and jeopardize the one good thing he has going: a growing economy. One can only hope that the president continues to keep that consideration in mind as he picks other nominees.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Guide to Moral Living", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The censorship order handed down from the Chinese Communist Party earlier this year reads like a decree from a Puritan: depictions of underage drinking, gambling and extreme violence are not permitted online; images of scantily clad people and portrayals of homosexuality are off limits; spiritual figures and beliefs cannot be satirized.The priggishness of Communist Party censors is not new, but the escalation of puritanical policing in the past year reflects wider forces shaping Chinese society under President Xi Jinping. Following Mr. Xi\u2019s high-profile crackdown on corrupt officials and thorough silencing of liberal intellectuals, the president\u2019s most ambitious project with the wider public is underway: an attempt to govern not only citizens\u2019 political outlook but, more than any leader since Mao, also the minutiae of their moral life.Grander efforts have led to the creation of new rules and institutions: a Good Samaritan law passed in March, for instance, protects individuals from being extorted by those they had helped, a circumstance that was so common that it deterred people from coming to the aid of people in need. Also in the pipeline is a government-managed social-credit system that will rate citizens\u2019 trustworthiness by tracking their personal data, from financial information to compliance with traffic rules.Heavy-handed as they may be, these policies stem from government apprehension that is not ill founded. It\u2019s a refrain among ordinary Chinese that the decay of public morality is turning society into a crass, unscrupulous, every-man-for-himself marketplace.Chinese anxiety over public morality goes back more than a century, when the country was at the mercy of Western powers. Looking deep into the national soul, Chinese intellectuals blamed the lack of civic morality for China\u2019s weakness. Leaders from Chiang Kai-shek to Deng Xiaoping waged \u201cmorality\u201d-boosting campaigns to combat foreign influences on domestic politics.Under Mr. Xi, the moral agenda of the state speaks to something larger: It is integral to his vision of China as a country of patriotic, diligent and civilized people that, led by a capable and highly disciplined Communist Party, is poised to achieve \u201cnational rejuvenation.\u201dThe strategy echoes the ancient Chinese political mandate of \u201cgoverning with virtue\u201d \u2014 the idea that social harmony derives from the moral rectitude of the rulers \u2014 but in practice it promotes an amalgamation of values carefully culled from China\u2019s past and present.The public is instructed to adhere to Confucian family roles at home and to demonstrate capitalist professionalism at work. Wealthy officials are warned against betraying revolutionary frugality, while aspiring entrepreneurs are told to infuse their endeavors with patriotic ideals.The effort to regulate public morality also means molding the incongruous government practices into a coherent ideology. The campaign\u2019s overreliance on authoritarian tactics like surveillance and censorship have alienated a growing rank of citizens who see the paradox in the censors\u2019 mission: The proliferation of the \u201cvulgar\u201d entertainment that is coming under fire is a result of restrictions on more sophisticated and critical artistic expressions. Social discussions have degenerated into coarse polemics online because of the lack of space for more nuanced and incisive conversations.During the Communist Party leadership reshuffle last month, some of Beijing\u2019s streets were bathed in red lights. The slogan \u201cThere is no new China without the Communist Party\u201d beamed from electronic screens that a week earlier had displayed advertisements for Buick and Chanel. Farther along those streets, state-sponsored posters counseled thriftiness and restraint. People streamed by without raising their heads.Chinese leaders may not be wrong in their belief that their new hodgepodge ideology will not antagonize a jaded public with its incoherence. But they should also recognize that under people\u2019s begrudging compliance, a growing sense of resignation is threatening something vital.Dutiful entrepreneurs and obedient apparatchiks may be easy subjects to govern. But the enterprising spirit and the appetite for risk-taking they are forced to shed are fundamental to the innovation-driven economy Mr. Xi promises to build for the future.Helen Gao is a social policy analyst at a research company and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Murphy, the Democratic candidate, and Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, the Republican candidate, for New Jersey governor. We also solicited questions from readers for the candidates. Here are edited excerpts:Secondly, the very wealthiest, the big corporations have had loopholes, hedge funds have loopholes, they\u2019ve had a really good ride. We\u2019re going to tighten up, to do some good housekeeping. By the way, we\u2019re hardly George Washington on this. I think 28 or 30 states have done it. The carried interest loophole is the most egregious loophole on the tax books, and if they\u2019re not going to close it federally, we\u2019re going to close it. Closing the out-of-network health care loophole. You add a bunch of those things up, it gets to $1.3 billion.And then we\u2019ve got to grow again. We haven\u2019t grown. We left $20 billion to $50 billion of economic activity on the table.You\u2019ve got the fourth smallest state in the nation geographically, you\u2019re the densest state, you sit beside the largest market in the world, you think the one thing you get right would be commuter rail. So we haven\u2019t talked about the federal government, where we have a lousy give get relationship, and they\u2019ve got to play a big role in the infrastructure economy, particularly Gateway [a proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River]. There\u2019s federal money in the Hudson-Bergen light rail as well, in addition to state and county help.And I\u2019ve said, community college \u2014 we want to find the money. Now, that\u2019s a bargain at under $200 million. Universal pre-K is $600 million to $650 million. That\u2019s going to take longer. We can\u2019t get there in one or two years.I think we\u2019ve got a very buttoned down, pay-as-you-go model, with a big step to get this place fair again, get the middle class invested in it again. And then we\u2019ll go from there, as we can get the resources, as we grow this economy.And then I say two things: May I please tell you about some other chapters of my life, like the way I grew up working poor. My dad didn\u2019t get out of high school. But I also say, you know what, this is a state that\u2019s in crisis.I think there are things that I learned when I was there that actually matter, and are applicable to what we need to do in the state. And the two that I cite are seeing countless models of job creation, good and bad, around the world. That matters, I think. And secondly, I have dealt with rating agencies for 20-odd years, and in a state that\u2019s been downgraded 11 straight times, I think that\u2019s relevant.So it doesn\u2019t frustrate me. But I want to make sure people see, one, it\u2019s a bigger book, and two, there actually are some relevant things in that experience that matter.If you\u2019ve got a community where the residents are not worried about their immigration status, but are, in fact, very worried about keeping peace and public safety, and they feel comfortable coming out of the shadows, and you\u2019re a community leader and Dan\u2019s the mayor and Matt\u2019s the chief of police or the guy on the beat, and I\u2019ve got no issue with talking to any of you about what\u2019s going on in the community, that\u2019s a safer community. Period. So I don\u2019t regret standing on behalf of that at all.Other things on our list are to finally get the funding locked down and get Gateway going. And we\u2019ve got a couple of pregnant light rail projects that are out there. The one up north \u2014 that\u2019s the biggest \u2014 is Hudson-Bergen. Down south it\u2019s Gloucester-Camden. They\u2019ve each got a similar notion.We talked early on about doing an audit immediately of N.J. Transit, and that would include the relationship with the L.I.R.R. and Amtrak and Penn Station. That\u2019s an immediate step. We believe there are enormous assets within the N.J. Transit umbrella that are untapped.People elected a governor to make the ultimate decision. That\u2019s what this governor did. He took the advice \u2014 or not \u2014 of his cabinet, including his lieutenant governor. I only spoke out loud when he started to increase taxes on the most taxed people in this country. That is unacceptable to me, that is not what I signed up for, and that is why I started to speak about it out loud.A. No. No, no, no, no. That is not the only thing I found unacceptable. But am I going to tell you that? No. I think it\u2019s completely inappropriate for a lieutenant governor to criticize a governor. You\u2019re on the same ticket. You ran together. But I did disagree with him loudly on his priorities when I thought they were different than the priorities we set in 2010 \u2014 the gas tax being one of them, the statehouse renovation being another one.A. I\u2019m not talking about repealing the gas tax. I\u2019m talking about taking the politics out of it. I\u2019m thoroughly convinced that when the legislature \u2014 and I have no basis in this, so I probably shouldn\u2019t say that \u2014 I don\u2019t believe they focused on the fact that there was a panel of four that would make a decision as to where $2 billion in infrastructure build-out would go in New Jersey. That panel of four in New Jersey will become the most sought-after group of men or women in the state, because they will control $2 billion of where our bridges get done, our roads gets done, our trains get fixed. That is the worst public policy to come to New Jersey, I believe, in the history of the state, and I\u2019m not exaggerating.And I say that because transportation should be evidenced-based, and the fixing of infrastructure should be evidence-based. It shouldn\u2019t be decided by four guys sitting in Trenton who were handpicked by politicians. It should be decided objectively, based on evidence, so that it\u2019s fair to everybody and defensible to everybody.I was in charge of the Red Tape Commission. So as part of that Red Tape Commission, we went back and audited all of the regulations facing New Jerseyans, and that was a huge task. We went, in one year, from 7,000 pages of recommended regulations to about 60 percent less, I want to say. I\u2019ll get the exact numbers for you.So that\u2019s what we did, and then the next step is to now a desk audit. I can\u2019t do it all at one time.I do know this: there are 800,000 DACA or \u201cdreamer\u201d young people in this country. That\u2019s 800,000 reasons for Congress to finally fix the problem. We are all tired of fighting about it. Let\u2019s give these young people \u2014 I was going to say children, but they\u2019re not \u2014 young people a certainty.And so that\u2019s the leverage. That\u2019s leverage on Congress to get something done. And that I agree with.Twenty thousand in New Jersey itself \u2014 you know, we don\u2019t want to break up families. We don\u2019t want families to be torn apart. We don\u2019t want those kids who didn\u2019t have any choice about coming into this country to go to a country they don\u2019t know. But you know Congress has to take action, and now there\u2019s leverage. Unfortunately it\u2019s human leverage. But it\u2019s still leverage. Fix the problem.You can\u2019t just be \u201cyes.\u201d Yes is a simplistic answer and an uninformed one. We need to be informed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the U.S. Needs a Federal Jobs Program, Not Payouts", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe need to help people like Tiffany, who did not want her last name used, will grow only more acute: Job dislocation and wage pressure caused by rapid technological development and globalization are likely to persist for a long time. These forces can contribute powerfully to productivity and growth, but they have worsened problems in our economy, from stagnant wages to the lack of opportunities for those with less education.Too many people lack access to entry-level jobs with good wages, especially in industries like manufacturing, where activity is actually near a high. The reason is that technology has enabled this work to be done by far fewer employees \u2014 or it\u2019s not being done at all, because workers don\u2019t have the specialized skills certain jobs demand.That\u2019s where a robust federal jobs program could help. Millions of Americans could work in high-need areas rebuilding and repairing crumbling roads and bridges or taking care of the elderly. The jobs should pay a living wage (even during the training phase), come with good benefits and be widely available, including to the formerly incarcerated. The program could include both public jobs and subsidized private employment, either temporary or longer-term. The jobs would provide credentials and hard and soft skills through on-the-job training, which could then facilitate a transition into unsubsidized private-sector employment. We should also invest in more vocational training and apprenticeships, like the one Tiffany landed.Public employment should be viewed not as a social program but as a public investment with a high rate of return. The return is increased economic output, coupled with the development of human capital \u2014 which increases productivity and the size of the effective labor force \u2014 in a population and economy that badly need it. That human capital, in turn, could catalyze more business investment and activity in low-income neighborhoods, which would further promote economic growth.The universal basic income wouldn\u2019t help people upgrade skills and be more successful in the labor market, or generate useful economic output, or give them the sense of purpose and dignity that comes from work. Public employment, however, would provide these social and economic benefits \u2014 and a paycheck.People like Tiffany want to be productive members of the work force and have opportunities for advancement. The basic income is defeatist \u2014 the solution to our jobs problem is not to give up on equipping workers with the skills they need for a changing economy. Instead, a federal jobs program would provide people with work that is both personally meaningful and economically beneficial.If we don\u2019t put in place a constructive response to wage and job pressures, we could face ever-greater difficulty attracting public support for sound economic policy. While we pursue public employment, we must also help those who can\u2019t work because of health or family circumstances, by, for example, extending the child-tax credit to the poorest children. And we should protect other programs that support low-income people or prepare them for the work force, such as Medicaid, food stamps, job training, child care and the earned-income tax credit.The federal jobs program I\u2019ve described doesn\u2019t have the intuitive simplicity of the universal basic income. But it serves critical purposes that the basic income doesn\u2019t and should be an integral part of a broad-based agenda to address rapidly changing economic conditions. Adopting a federal jobs program could enhance our work force and increase our nation\u2019s output while providing people with the self-worth and economic opportunity that work can provide.Robert E. Rubin, a co-chairman emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, was the Treasury secretary from 1995 to 1999.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fires Aren\u2019t the Only Threat to the California Dream", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe shortage harms rural communities on the fringes of the Bay Area, but it is rooted in urban communities in the region\u2019s core \u2014 San Francisco, Oakland, Palo Alto and Berkeley. It is exacerbated by well-meaning but misguided housing policies championed by urban liberals. The area has some of the most progressive voters and policymakers in the nation, yet it has also adopted some of the most regressive housing policies, with large costs for low-income renters and the environment.The regional economy of the Bay Area is like an integrated ecosystem, where everything is connected. The exceptional economic dynamism of the region\u2019s urban core affects the labor and housing market as well as the physical environment in the periphery.The San Francisco and Silicon Valley labor markets are the most robust since the mid-1960s, when researchers started collecting jobs data \u2014 and employment and wages are higher today than at the peak of the dot-com boom of 2000. Young, well-educated workers can have some of the best careers in the world here. Labor productivity and wages are among the highest anywhere, creativity and innovation flourish, and incomes are growing inside and outside the tech sector.The problem is largely self-inflicted: the region has some of the country\u2019s slowest, most political and cumbersome housing approval processes and most stringent land-use restrictions.Thanks to aggressive lobbying by an odd coalition of Nimby homeowners and progressives \u2014 radical county supervisors, tenants\u2019 unions, environmental groups \u2014 in places like San Francisco and Oakland, it takes years (and sometimes even decades), harsh political battles and arduous appeals to get a market-rate housing project approved.Everything is political in the Bay Area, but housing most of all.Some restrictions make sense: Nobody wants skyscrapers poking up among Victorian houses, and nobody wants to tear down historical buildings. But many others don\u2019t: There are scores of empty parking lots in San Francisco and Oakland that can\u2019t be built on because of political opposition.The lack of supply means rents and housing values increase faster than necessary. For homeowners, this is a boon, as their assets keep appreciating. For renters, this means an ever-increasing cost of living and for some, an impetus to pack up and leave.One way to think about it is that the enormous increase in wealth generated by the tech boom is largely captured by homeowners in the urban core who bought before the boom. By fighting new market-rate housing, Nimbys and Bay Area progressives are de facto making the housing shortage worse. Ironically, given residents typically progressive political leanings, this has regressive consequences, because it helps rich insiders at the expense of everyone else.The second negative consequence of the region\u2019s restrictive housing policies in the urban core is environmental degradation on the periphery. Good environmental stewardship suggests that we should build more in the urban core near transit and jobs and less on the fringes. Yet because of cities\u2019 strict housing regulations, we build more on farmland on the region\u2019s outskirts and less in the city center where demand is higher.Families who can\u2019t afford San Francisco, Berkeley or Silicon Valley have to move to exurbs. Some 3,800 Californians leave urban parts of the Bay Area for cheaper housing in Sonoma and Napa Counties every year. This worsens traffic and heightens the pressure for development on the edge of the region \u2014 in places such as Santa Rosa, home to some of the neighborhoods hardest hit by this month\u2019s fires.This extracts enormous environmental costs. Bay Area urban progressives, by fighting new housing in their neighborhoods, cause more sprawl on the rural fringes. I\u2019m a committed environmentalist, and it made me rethink the way I engage with such issues: For example, I was a member of the Sierra Club for a more than a decade. But because of all the unwise battles waged by the San Francisco chapter against smart housing growth in the city, I quit to support other environmental groups.Just like fires, bad housing policies can carry horrendous social and environmental costs. As the smoke from the Northern California fires clears, our urban communities should follow the examples of other progressive cities, and embrace smart growth.For this to happen, local urban progressives must moderate their reflexive opposition to all new market-based housing. The main winners will be the region\u2019s most vulnerable: urban renters as well as the land and inhabitants of areas incinerated by the recent infernos.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Power Line Fails; Darkness Returns to San Juan", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 A main power line that serves the northern half of Puerto Rico failed Thursday, knocking out electricity to seven cities that had only recently regained service and dealing a major setback to the island\u2019s desperate efforts to regain normality.The disruption also meant that many people no longer had running water, because pumping stations are powered by electricity.\u201cWe\u2019re all in the dark,\u201d said Maritza Cuprill, 54, a property manager whose San Juan condominium got its power back a week ago, only to lose it again on Thursday. \u201cI was in Walgreens and everything suddenly went pitch black. The first thing I thought of was my vehicle: I filled up the tank for just in case. That was devastating when we had to wait in lines for five, six and seven hours.\u201dMs. Cuprill was not worried about any food purchases: she had not been foolhardy enough to buy perishables. Many areas where the power had returned had suffered continuous glitches, damaging appliances and fraying nerves.\u201cI buy food every day,\u201d Ms. Cuprill said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust what they say. They say the power will be back in 19 hours. I will believe that when I see it.\u201dIn a statement Thursday afternoon, the Puerto Rican government said that workers had made progress toward the repairs and that equipment was being put in place to restore the service.Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez said the electric company, known as Prepa, would focus first on bringing the lights back to hospitals, airports, fire stations and areas that are crucial to the economy. He said the most affected areas were in the San Juan metropolitan area, including the cities of Vega Baja, Arecibo, Barceloneta, Manat\u00ed, Bayam\u00f3n, San Juan and areas near Can\u00f3vanas.The power failure was the latest blow for Puerto Rico\u2019s beleaguered and bankrupt power company, which has been criticized for awarding a small Montana firm a $300 million contract to fix power lines that included highly unusual clauses that prohibited any audits. Several congressional committees are investigating the deal, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has vowed not to pay for it.\u201cPuerto Rico is not rising,\u201d Rosita Aponte, who owns a pharmacy in Caguas, said, referring to a popular slogan #PuertoRicoSeLevanta. \u201cWhen it does rise, it will be empty, because all of the small-business owners will have left.\u201dMs. Aponte said the lights went out en masse to all the businesses on her strip.\u201cWe can\u2019t take this anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent $8,000 on broken generators.

{"Headline": "Republican Tax Plan: How to Make Sense of the Push in Congress", "Date": null, "News": "Advertisement\nThe idea of tax cuts has always been popular, but if the system doesn\u2019t bring in enough revenue to pay for necessities \u2014 soldiers\u2019 salaries, highway construction and disaster relief, among others \u2014 then the changes could undercut economic growth and the standard of living.A far-reaching tax bill like the ones now being considered would touch nearly every American and every business in small ways and large. There are proposals that could affect how much it costs you to buy a house, care for a sick relative, adopt a child and send a child to private school.Several analyses, including one from the Congressional Budget Office this week, have said that the Senate bill would hurt workers earning less than $30,000 a year, while delivering benefits to the highest earners throughout the next decade.By 2027, the budget office said, Americans earning $75,000 a year and below would, as a group, see their taxes increase as cuts expire.Here are three main proposals that would affect individuals and households:Eliminate individual health-care mandate.Change the number of income brackets.The House bill reduces the seven current marginal income tax brackets to four: 12, 25, 35 and 39.6 percent. The Senate bill would retain seven brackets with reduced marginal rates: 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35 and 38.5 percent.Increase the standard deduction.Here are three main proposals that would affect businesses:Slash the top corporate rate to 20%.The idea in bringing down the rate from 35 percent is to help American corporations compete better with foreign rivals, which are subjected to lower tax rates, and discourage homegrown businesses from moving to lower-tax havens abroad.Transform the way global profits are taxed.Under the current system, all profits are subject to domestic taxes, but the House and Senate bills would fence off the money that multinationals earn outside the United States.Provide a tax cut to \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses.Most American businesses are organized not as corporations but as \u201cpass-through\u201d entities like partnerships and proprietorships, where the income is passed along to their owners and then taxed under the individual income tax system.No matter the intention, all the proposals carry a risk that vague language and incomplete safeguards would open up lots of opportunities for businesses and wealthy investors and proprietors to avoid paying the taxes they owe. That not only undermines confidence in the entire system, but also raises the burden on other taxpayers who don\u2019t have the same opportunities.As for the international provisions, critics worry that freeing companies from taxes earned outside the United States would make it even more attractive for firms to send jobs, operations and profits overseas.Republicans argue that their tax cuts would unleash enormous growth: Companies and individuals would have more to spend and invest, which would spur expansion and job creation. All that growth, supporters argue, would help blunt the reduced amount of revenue collected because of various proposed tax cuts.But opponents have argued that there is little historical evidence that tax cuts lead to sustained growth, and most economists say cuts financed by deficits have the potential to undermine growth.Republicans are aggressively marketing their plan as a \u201cmiddle-class tax cut\u201d that would benefit everyone. Several independent analyses agree, however, that the overwhelmingly majority of the financial gains would go to the wealthiest Americans.Normally, once both chambers pass a bill, the serious horse-trading would begin behind closed doors. A small group of representatives and senators would get together to work out differences between the two versions in what\u2019s known as a conference. The final bill would only allow members to vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201dBut the White House may try to push a strategy of incorporating whatever changes need to be made to satisfy House Republicans while the bill is still pending in the Senate, so that the House could simply approve the Senate version and send the bill directly to Mr. Trump for his signature \u2014 perhaps in time for Christmas.Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.A graphic with an earlier version of this article mislabled the percentage of people earning less than $30,000 whose tax burden would increase next year under the Senate plan.

{"Headline": "How to Protect the Atlantic Fishery", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFishermen like myself, however, recognized it right away as an Atlantic menhaden. Anglers learn to look for that small fish, because we know that where we find menhaden, we\u2019ll also find whales, striped bass and a wealth of other marine life. During my last striped bass fishing trip off the Rockaways, I was lucky enough to catch my fill of big stripers and see feeding by porpoises, osprey and humpbacks. It was a National Geographic experience just a few miles from Manhattan.An important reason for bountiful catches like mine, many scientists believe, is the recovery of the menhaden, which began in 2013 after the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, the government body that manages the species and others, enacted the first-ever catch limits for the fish, which is rendered into heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acid fish oil and used to produce fertilizers and high-protein animal feeds. This reduced the menhaden harvest by 20 percent. Menhaden have responded by returning in large numbers to New York, attracting the whales, striped bass, osprey and other species that feed on them.Unfortunately, this progress is at risk.This is why many recreational fishermen, scientists, conservationists, whale and bird watchers and even chefs and scuba divers support a policy that would consider managing menhaden in the context of the species\u2019 role as an important prey fish for predators. Doing so would set an important precedent for managing other so-called forage fish and would be a welcome departure from the present approach of narrowly focusing on how many fish of a particular species can be sustainably harvested.Opposition to a more ecological approach comes principally from Omega Protein Inc., the largest industrial harvester of menhaden on the East Coast. The company catches hundreds of millions of menhaden every year. Omega Protein and the state of Virginia, where the company runs its Atlantic fishing operations, want aggressive catch increases that would jeopardize the recent success in managing menhaden populations.At its meeting this week, the commission should take the responsible approach and manage menhaden using the best available science to both sustain fishing and the many predators that depend on them. Doing so would mark a turning point for Atlantic coast communities and our oceans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Talk of Turkey? A Politically Charged Trial in New York", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 The trial is about to start in a Lower Manhattan courtroom, but it is the talk of Turkish government officials, television and even cafes.Turkey is churning over the prosecution by the American authorities of two prominent Turks accused of conspiring to violate United States sanctions against Iran. After a failed campaign to persuade American officials to drop the case, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week turned to damage control, angrily denigrating the whole judicial process.On Monday, jury selection is to begin in the Federal District Court trial amid broad speculation that the lead defendant, Reza Zarrab, who is accused of managing a billion-dollar scheme to smuggle gold for Iranian oil, has entered into a plea bargain with the prosecution and may reveal damaging evidence about corruption and illegal dealings in high places.If Mr. Zarrab has indeed become a government witness, prosecutors are still expected to proceed to trial against a co-defendant, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Turkish banker who has pleaded not guilty. Seven other defendants have been charged but remain at large, prosecutors have said.Mr. Zarrab\u2019s arrest in March 2016 \u2014 while on a family trip to Disney World \u2014 raised tensions between Turkey and the United States, and on the eve of trial, relations between the two NATO allies are now at their lowest point in years.Mr. Erdogan himself could face political consequences should Mr. Zarrab testify, if there are any convictions or if the United States takes action against Turkish banks found to have been involved in the scheme. The president faces a re-election campaign in 2019 or earlier.\u201cWe know too well, the issue here is not the future of our party, but the fate of our country,\u201d Mr. Erdogan told Parliament in a weekly address on Tuesday. \u201cUnder the cover of rule of law, one of the major traps against our country has been devised.\u201dBut opposition politicians have jumped on the case. \u201cWhat\u2019s nationalist about corruption?\u201d said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the Republican People\u2019s Party.As the trial approached and Mr. Zarrab was moved from a New York jail to an unknown location, the Turkish media went into a frenzy of speculation over whether he was cooperating with prosecutors. Officials made several inquiries to the United States as to his whereabouts, and government ministers came out of their shells to engage the foreign news media and try to play down the importance of any testimony by Mr. Zarrab.\u201cWhy should I be concerned?\u201d Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said, when asked about possible revelations that could come from Mr. Zarrab\u2019s testimony. \u201cI did not drink untreated milk, so why should I worry about my stomach?\u201dThe level of denial by the government is a clear indicator of how worried it is about the Zarrab case, including the risk it may pose for the economy, said Atilla Yesilada, Turkey analyst for the New-York based management consultancy GlobalSource Partners. \u201cThere is huge concern,\u201d he said.For its part, the United States has been expressing concern over Mr. Erdogan\u2019s increasingly authoritarian rule, in particular his imposition of a state of emergency since the coup attempt.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government has long maintained that it has abided by the United Nations sanctions aimed at curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. But it has openly disagreed with additional United States sanctions on buying oil and gas from Iran.\u201cNothing has been done in secret,\u201d the economy minister, Nihat Zeybekci, told a Turkish newspaper. \u201cIt is extremely transparent.\u201dMr. Zarrab, 34, an Iranian-Turk who ran a foreign exchange business and gold dealership, managed an oil-for-gold arrangement that drew him accolades in Turkey. For four or five years, the trade allowed his country to import oil and gas and use the profits to lower its trade deficit, Mr. Zarrab said at the time.It also made Mr. Zarrab fabulously wealthy. His wife, the Turkish pop star Ebru Gundes, once bragged that he had promised to buy her the planet Mars.The American indictment says that Mr. Zarrab bribed Turkish bank and customs officials, including a former economy minister, Zafer Caglayan, with millions of dollars. Mr. Caglayan is one of the defendants named in the case who prosecutors have said are still at large. Another is Suleyman Aslan, a former general manager of Halkbank, a state-owned Turkish bank that helped facilitate the scheme, the indictment says.Mr. Erdogan dismissed the 2013 investigation as a thinly veiled attack against his government and his family by followers of Mr. Gulen, a former Islamist ally who became increasingly critical of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s leadership and what he said was the corruption of his government. Turkish police officials who worked on the Zarrab case were later detained in widespread purges, and four of the prosecutors are wanted by the authorities.Now, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government is accusing American prosecutors of building their case on the same evidence \u2014 fabricated evidence, they say \u2014 used by Gulenist prosecutors in 2013. \u201cWhen this plot failed, they set up the same plot in the U.S.,\u201d the president told Parliament.Turkey\u2019s justice minister, Abdulhamit Gul, told reporters in Istanbul in September that the case was built on \u201cused chewing gum\u201d and would \u201ccast a shadow on the American legal system.\u201d\u201cWe expect the U.S.A. not to be involved in a political drive to humiliate the Turkish nation, and damage relations with the great and ancient Turkish Republic,\u201d Mr. Gul said.With tensions escalating, Turkey said it had opened an investigation of Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan whose office first charged Mr. Zarrab, and of his successor, Joon H. Kim.And Mr. Bharara responded dismissively to a statement by Mr. Cavusoglu, Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, that Mr. Bharara was \u201cvery close\u201d to Mr. Gulen.\u201cTurkey FM is a liar,\u201d Mr. Bharara said on Twitter. \u201cNow let\u2019s see what happens in court.\u201dFollow @carlottagall and @BenWeiserNYT on Twitter.Carlotta Gall reported from Istanbul, and Benjamin Weiser from New York.Advertisement"}

When Congress created it six years ago, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it gave the agency broad powers over a wide variety of financial products, including mortgages, credit cards, bank accounts and student loans.But the bureau has long been vilified by Republicans as an overreaching, aggressive arm of government.Installing Mr. Mulvaney, a fiscal hawk who previously called the agency a \u201csick, sad\u201d joke, as the agency\u2019s interim leader would immediately alter the consumer bureau\u2019s focus.Two White House officials, speaking to reporters in a briefing call on Saturday, cited guidance from the Office of Legal Counsel, part of the Justice Department, as legal grounds for Mr. Trump\u2019s move.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to name his own temporary director was a \u201ctypical, routine move,\u201d said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The official later said, \u201cWe have gone out of our way to avoid any unnecessary legal battle with Mr. Cordray,\u201d adding that \u201chis actions clearly indicate he is trying to provoke one.\u201dThe 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which established the bureau \u2014 and gave it unusual independence from Congress and the president \u2014 laid out a succession path in the case of the director\u2019s \u201cabsence or unavailability,\u201d the office acknowledged. The deputy director then steps in as the agency\u2019s acting head, according to the act.But that law \u201cdoes not displace the president\u2019s authority under the Vacancies Reform Act,\u201d wrote Steven A. Engel, the assistant attorney general in charge of the office.But the consumer bureau holds a different legal view.Mr. Cordray cited the Dodd-Frank Act when he followed up his resignation announcement on Friday with a letter naming the agency\u2019s chief of staff, Leandra English, as deputy director. Mr. Cordray said he expected Ms. English to take over from him.Democrats, who fought for the bureau\u2019s creation and championed its work as a valuable defense against predatory companies and abusive financial practices, are likely to push for a legal challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s move.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who proposed the consumer bureau and helped set it up, said Mr. Trump\u2019s move was legally impermissible.Former Representative Barney Frank, a co-author of the act, said the consumer bureau is \u201cdifferent in every way\u201d from other federal agencies and was intended to have more autonomy.\u201cWe gave a lot of attention to how to structure the C.F.P.B. and how to protect its independence, because its job is to go after some very powerful forces in the economy,\u201d Mr. Frank, who wrote the law with Christopher Dodd, then a senator, said in an interview on CNN.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to appoint Mr. Mulvaney is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Mr. Frank told CNN. Asked how the move could be challenged, he answered, \u201cI literally don\u2019t know.\u201dSome legal experts say there is reason to question whether the Federal Vacancies Reform Act supersedes an individual agency\u2019s designated line of succession.The Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s views are generally considered binding on the executive branch, but the judiciary is not constrained by them. Courts have, at times, disagreed with the office\u2019s legal interpretations \u2014 and their rulings take precedence.\u201cAny Office of Legal Counsel, in any administration, would have given the same answer with respect to this issue,\u201d said Aditya Bamzai, a law professor at the University of Virginia. \u201cBut if we see a legal challenge, the executive branch\u2019s positions don\u2019t always prevail in court.\u201dStephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said it was an \u201copen question\u201d which act \u2014 the vacancies law or Dodd-Frank \u2014 should take precedence, especially because Dodd-Frank was enacted more recently.On a mailing list for administrative law professors, a debate broke out on Saturday over specifics of the two laws. Experts argued about the nuances of various bits of fine print, including how individual words like \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d should be interpreted.Confirming a permanent director for the agency could take months. Mr. Cordray\u2019s confirmation was delayed for two years by Republicans and the banking industry, two parties that objected to the agency\u2019s creation and sought to limit the attempt at federal oversight.If he takes office, Mr. Mulvaney will shoulder his new job as acting chief on top of his role as director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is unclear how he will manage both. Administration officials directed all questions about the mechanics of the situation to Mr. Mulvaney.\u201cWe think he\u2019ll show up Monday, go into the office and start working,\u201d an administration official said of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s plans.But it may not be that simple. The next move lies with Ms. English: She will need to decide whether to mount a legal challenge against Mr. Mulvaney for the bureau\u2019s leadership, or to defer to him.\u201cIt\u2019s a very awkward legal scenario if they both show up literally at the same office,\u201d said Andy Grewal, a law professor at the University of Iowa. \u201cIt seems like both sides are trying to engage in gamesmanship here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nafta Talks Have High Stakes for Two Texas Bridge Owners", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "Private crossings to Mexico are a rich franchise under the North American Free Trade Agreement, but discussions on reopening the accord have put that bonanza at risk.Supported byRIO GRANDE CITY, Tex. \u2014 Caught quite literally in the middle of the international debate over the way the United States trades with its southern neighbor are two Texans named Sam.Sam Vale and Sam Sparks Jr. own two bridges that stretch across the Rio Grande, connecting farmers on either side with markets on the other, and linking communities in South Texas and northern Mexico that sometimes meet in the middle.The majority of border bridges belong to the government. But the Sams are exceptions, private owners of crossings collecting tolls that can exceed $30 per truck.As cross-border truck volume doubled in the last two decades, those tolls have given rise to a pair of multimillion-dollar businesses, a dividend of the traffic ferrying construction materials in both directions, avocados from Mexican fields to American supermarkets, and Midwestern wheat to Mexican breweries.\u201cWe used to joke that if you want to own a bridge, you have to be named Sam, Sam or Uncle Sam,\u201d said Mr. Vale, who owns a two-lane crossing in Rio Grande City, a bit more than an hour\u2019s drive from Mr. Sparks\u2019s four-lane roadway. Both men are second-generation bridge owners.But now their unique revenue stream could be in jeopardy.The focus on trade is exposing cracks of tension between the president and a constituency otherwise aligned with his economic instincts.Major retailers and manufacturers are mobilizing to keep the deal alive and to protest rules that could make it more expensive to bring parts and products in from Mexico. For the bridge moguls, anything that stanches the flow of traffic could be costly.Trucks carried $373 billion in cargo across bridges on the southern border last year, accounting for 71 percent of all trade in goods with Mexico, according to the American Trucking Association.\u201cNafta benefits this bridge big time,\u201d said Mr. Sparks, who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cWe kind of want them to leave it alone.\u201dThe bridge is a study in a trade deal that has been a boon to some American farmers and hurt others. For American corn, Progreso is one of the busiest exit points in the country. Nafta was a windfall for American grain producers, who have more efficient operations than their Mexican counterparts.It\u2019s a different story for watermelons and onions, which are trucked in from the depths of Mexico, filling the northbound lanes of Mr. Sparks\u2019s bridge on their way to American stores. Fresh fruit and vegetable harvesters in the United States complain about competition from a neighbor that can grow some crops year-round and pay farmhands much less.Mr. Sparks would like to see more trucks going south on his bridge, but he sees the give-and-take as unavoidable.\u201cWe export a lot of products through our bridge, and we get paid a toll, and we want that to continue,\u201d Mr. Sparks said. \u201cBut to do that we need fair trade. Mexico has to benefit from that. Canada has to benefit. If everyone is getting a good deal, it just works.\u201dBeyond the truck traffic, the town of Nuevo Progreso, at the southern end of Mr. Sparks\u2019s bridge, has found creative ways of cashing in on its proximity to Americans. There are abundant taco shops, tequila that can be bought and consumed in the streets, and many, many dental clinics. More than 100 dentists\u2019 offices cater to an American clientele seeking fillings and root canals at a fraction of the cost at home, along with 80 pharmacies offering pills and medical treatments at a cut rate. The attractions draw more than 800,000 pedestrians across Mr. Sparks\u2019s roadway every year, at a cost of 50 cents apiece.Some of them meet in the middle.Maria Maldonado lounged on a bench atop the bridge\u2019s walkway on a recent afternoon, facing a placard that announces the spot where Mexico ends and the United States begins. Ms. Maldonado, 33, lives in Nuevo Progreso and works in a taqueria there. She was waiting to meet her nephew, an American citizen who works as a carpenter 10 miles north of the border and has diabetes.\u201cHe wants medicine,\u201d she said, holding up two plastic bags, \u201cand tortillas.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s hard line on immigration could eventually slow foot traffic, experts say, by discouraging tourists from Mexico. But proposals on the Nafta negotiating table would more directly affect trucks and what they carried.The administration has floated the idea of increasing the American-made content in goods traded through the pact and requiring renegotiation every five years. Mr. Trump said last month that the United States might end the deal altogether.\u201cBusiness loves certainty, and they aren\u2019t getting any,\u201d said Raymond Robertson, an economist at Texas A&M University. Border bridges, he said, are \u201cground zero for Nafta trade, so if you start reducing the U.S.-Mexico trade, it will hit them first.\u201dIf it becomes expensive to send products north, Mexico could turn to one of the 45 countries with which it has free-trade agreements. Long the leading destination for American corn, Mexico has increasingly turned to suppliers in Brazil to hedge against Mr. Trump\u2019s tough talk on trade.\u201cIf Mexico diversifies, what are these bridge operators going to do?\u201d Mr. Robertson asked.Then Nafta was signed in 1993, and the number of commercial trucks went from one a week to as many as 300 a day. Mr. Vale takes in around $4 million a year in tolls. (Mr. Sparks, 63, would not specify his revenue, but it is also in the millions.)Mr. Vale has also pursued an array of ventures beyond the bridge. A column of eighteen-wheelers that were waiting to cross belongs to him, and so does the sand in them. He brought the dolomite limestone from a mine in Mexico, and it will travel to concrete producers and asphalt plants across South Texas, earning Mr. Vale millions each year.He owns about 60 acres around the bridge, and a railroad that runs through the property and links to a Union Pacific line. He is paid to transport pipes, lumber and sheet metal on rail cars that come in from a town a few miles away, but still on the American side.That mix of ventures has allowed Mr. Vale to indulge in some other pursuits. He drives a cherry red Mercedes-Benz drop-top with a license plate that reads \u201cCizzle.\u201d He has nine black German shepherds \u2014 some of which were flown from Prague for breeding \u2014 that live in climate-controlled doghouses scattered across his properties.\u201cCentral air and heat, insulated cedar-wood homes,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has them in Texas.\u201dMr. Vale does not love leaving Texas, but he has made six trips to Washington since the election to make his case to lawmakers. His pitch is simple: \u201cDon\u2019t hurt the country, don\u2019t hurt the businesses that support you, Mr. President. Don\u2019t hurt the people who are critical to the economic survival of the United States.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a picture caption with an earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to customers of a roadside food stand in Mexico. The stand caters to travelers headed to the United States, not specifically to Mexican truck drivers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Climate Report Says About the Impact of Global Warming", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe same, only worse.Global warming is affecting the United States more than ever, and the impacts \u2014 on communities, regions, infrastructure and sectors of the economy \u2014 are expected to increase.Like the scientific report, the draft of Volume II contains many of the same findings cited in the previous National Climate Assessment, published in 2014. But reflecting some of the impacts that have been felt across the country in the past three years, some of the emphasis has changed.Here\u2019s a look at some of what\u2019s new in the draft assessment.More and more of the predicted impacts of global warming are now becoming a reality.For instance, the 2014 assessment forecast that coastal cities would see more flooding in the coming years as sea levels rose. That\u2019s no longer theoretical: Scientists have now documented a record number of \u201cnuisance flooding\u201d events during high tides. In 2014, nearly half of residents in Hampton Roads, Va., could not get out of their neighborhoods at least once because of tidal flooding.Meanwhile, as the oceans have warmed, disruptions in United States fisheries, long predicted, are now underway. In 2012, record ocean temperatures caused lobster catches in Maine to peak a month earlier than usual \u2014 and the distribution chain was unprepared.The draft notes with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that climate change will increase ozone levels, as rising temperatures and changes in atmospheric circulation affect local weather conditions. But the increases will not be uniform; by near the end of the century the worst ozone levels will be found across a wide expanse of the Midwest and Northern Great Plains, while levels are expected to improve, at least somewhat, in parts of the Southeast.The report reiterates what residents of the West have learned from hard experience: that warmer springs, longer dry seasons in the summer and other impacts are lengthening the fire season. The smoke from fires affects not only health, the report says, but visibility.The previous assessment warned that few states and cities were taking steps to adapt to the impacts of climate change. That\u2019s slowly changing, the new draft finds. More and more communities are taking measures such as preserving wetlands along the coasts to act as buffers against storms.But outside of a few places in Louisiana and Alaska, few coastal communities are rethinking their development patterns in order to avoid the impacts from rising seas and severe weather that the report says are surely coming.The draft report cites these international concerns, but goes far beyond the military. Climate change is already affecting American companies\u2019 overseas operations and supply chains, it says, and as these impacts worsen it will take a toll on trade and the economy.Global warming and natural disasters are also affecting development in less affluent countries. That, the draft says, puts additional burdens on the United States for humanitarian assistance and disaster aid.The draft report suggests a different approach to assessing the effects of climate change, by considering how various impacts \u2014 on food supplies, water and electricity generation, for example \u2014 interact with each other.\u201cIt is not possible to understand the full extent of climate-related impacts in the United States without considering these interactions,\u201d the report says.It gives several examples, including recent droughts in California and elsewhere that, in combination with population changes, affects demand for water and energy. The draft also cites Hurricane Sandy, five years ago, which caused cascading impacts on interconnected systems in the New York area, some of which had not been anticipated. Flooding of subway and highway tunnels, for example, made it more difficult to repair the electrical system, which suffered widespread damage.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seven Critical Truths About North Korea", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterBut many analysts reacted with something closer to grizzled stoicism, greeting the launch as dispiriting but unsurprising confirmation of North Korea\u2019s capabilities and intentions. For them, news of the test, like the missile program itself, is unwelcome and concerning but not too terrifying.It\u2019s worth reviewing, then, some of the fundamentals that guide those experts\u2019 views of North Korea and its weapons.(1) It\u2019s over. North Korea is a nuclear power now.Policymakers will debate for years the precise moment at which the door closed to preventing or rolling back North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. But that door is most likely now closed.The North Koreans have little reason to give up their weapons programs, which bring them security against their otherwise vastly superior adversaries, and we have no way to make them.Well, there\u2019s one way: an invasion. But North Korea\u2019s missiles are mobile, meaning it could fire off at least one or two before the United States could take them out. Full-on war would be virtually guaranteed to bring an attempted North Korean nuclear strike against a major American city. (This assumes North Korea can mount a warhead on a missile, but we have little reason to doubt that it can.)In technical terms, that is described as a \u201ccredible deterrent capability.\u201d In nontechnical terms, it means the world has few options but to accept North Korea\u2019s nuclear status as a fact of life.(2) North Korea can probably strike Washington and New York now.Past tests demonstrated that North Korean missiles could reach major West Coast cities in the United States. This test, according to analysts, showed that it can reach East Coast cities now, too. That probably includes Washington and New York.(3) North Korea is rational, which means it\u2019s unlikely to start a war.The \u201cgood\u201d news is that North Korea has no apparent intention of starting a war, which it would surely lose. In other words, no, North Korea is probably not going to nuke your city out of the blue.This often gets lost in portrayals of Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s leader, as a wild-eyed lunatic. But while Mr. Kim might be eccentric, he has repeatedly proven himself to be rational. Ruthless and morally reprehensible, but rational. And no rational leader invites national suicide, which is all Mr. Kim would achieve by provoking a war.The United States has its own nuclear weapons, as well as overwhelming conventional military superiority, to deter North Korea. Historically, deterrence works. It\u2019s how the United States has lived for decades with the threat of Russian and Chinese nuclear weapons.(4) China might not be able to solve the North Korea problem.But it may be time to consider why this strategy never seems to work.North Korea is convinced that giving up its nuclear weapons would invite an American invasion, similar to what happened to Libya after it surrendered its own warheads. China can put a lot of pressure on little North Korea, but it\u2019s not clear that such pressure scares Mr. Kim more than the threat of national destruction.In any case, North Korea and China have been increasingly at odds. North Korea\u2019s weapons tests often seemed timed to humiliate and defy Beijing. China has imposed its own sanctions in response. So while Americans sometimes perceive China as supporting North Korea\u2019s provocations, in fact the opposite is often true.(5) North Korea has shown it can endure extreme economic punishment.Since then, North Korea has improved its agricultural practices. So while Mr. Kim would rather avoid another economic collapse, he probably believes, with some reason, that his country could survive one.(6) North Korea may not want war, but it\u2019s still scary.What these strategies have in common is a desire to secure North Korea\u2019s place in the world.Theory one, most widely held among experts, says that North Korea wants to use its weapons to pressure the world into accepting it as a legitimate member of the international community. This, the thinking goes, would bring trade and normalization while keeping Mr. Kim\u2019s government in power, sort of like China\u2019s opening in the 1970s. That\u2019s scary because it means Mr. Kim isn\u2019t giving up until the world accepts his government as it is \u2014 cruel, provocative and nuclear-armed.Theory two, more controversial, says that North Korea ultimately wants to reunify with South Korea. The North can never be truly secure, in this view, as long as the freer and more prosperous South remains independent, implicitly undermining the North\u2019s reason to exist as a separate state. This doesn\u2019t mean invading and conquering South Korea outright, but rather slowly building ties between the two Koreas \u2014 and breaking the South away from its American protectors \u2014 until they reunify bloodlessly.(7) Worry, but don\u2019t burst a blood vessel.The greatest risk, analysts tend to say, is from an accident or miscalculation that might send North Korea and the United States into an unintended conflict. That\u2019s how war would start.Maybe, for instance, the United States sends a bomber near North Korea as a symbolic threat, but the bomber veers off course toward Pyongyang, which North Korea perceives as the start of a war, leading it to fire missiles in perceived self-defense.These sorts of scenarios are unlikely, and require a number of things to go wrong. But the odds aren\u2019t zero and, if it happened, entire cities could be destroyed.It\u2019s hard to know how to conceptualize that sort of high-risk, low-probability event. It\u2019s worth worrying about. But you\u2019re still at far greater risk from, say, smoking. Or a car accident. Or not having sufficient health care.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citigroup, Twitter, Lyft: Prince\u2019s Arrest Touches Many", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmong Prince Alwaleed\u2019s crown jewels: sizable stakes in Twitter, Lyft and Citigroup. He has gone into business with some of the corporate world\u2019s biggest titans, including Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and Michael R. Bloomberg.His investments span the globe, including the Four Seasons Hotel George V in Paris, the Savoy in London and the Plaza in New York. He has also invested in the AccorHotels chain and Canary Wharf, the London business development.So vast are his investments that he has been referred to as the Warren Buffett of the Middle East.Prince Alwaleed\u2019s arrest is likely to reverberate across dozens of companies around the world that count the investment company that he founded, Kingdom Holding, as a major investor or shareholder.The arrests appeared to be the crown prince\u2019s latest step to make good on his ambitious modernization plans and to further consolidate the remarkable degree of power he has amassed at age 32 over military, foreign, economic and social policies. His ascent and brash approach have angered some members of the royal family.Prince Alwaleed, a 62-year-old with an Omar Sharif mustache, ubiquitous sunshades and penchant for publicity, is a relatively flamboyant figure for the royal family and is one of the most prominent Saudis internationally. His arrest seems aimed at demonstrating that no one is beyond the reach of the committee and the crown prince.The confinement of the princes, said to be in the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh, could be a particularly strange experience for Prince Alwaleed, who owns stakes in a number of Four Seasons hotels.Set to action-movie music, much of the video unfolds against the backdrop of his 280-foot yacht, the Kingdom 5KR.During the trip, the prince, who already owns several dozen hotels in Egypt, announced a further $800 million investment in the country\u2019s tourism industry. He drew criticism from some conservative Egyptians for a video that showed him meeting with Egypt\u2019s female minister of investment and international cooperation, Sahar Nasr, aboard his yacht while he was again wearing shorts. It was unusual protocol in a public meeting for a member of the family that rules a hyperconservative Islamic kingdom.The arrests also come as Crown Prince Mohammed has forged a close relationship with President Trump, who shares his aggressive approach to Saudi\u2019s regional rival, Iran, and his penchant for bold decisions.But despite his wealth, Prince Alwaleed was not seen as particularly powerful within the Saudi royal family or as a threat to the crown prince\u2019s consolidation of power. His father, Prince Talal, known as the \u201cRed Prince,\u201d spent years in exile after leading a kind of leftist revolt among royals in 1962, and had grumbled in the past about being passed over in the royal succession. Prince Alwaleed himself initially objected to the naming of Mohammed as crown prince, though he quickly stopped complaining in public.A more likely reason for his inclusion in the arrests, experts said, is that he might have gone bankrupt during the 2008 financial crisis. He had been highly leveraged and somehow got elements of the government to bail him out, through his connections to then-King Abdullah and the finance minister, who is also said to have been arrested. Prince Alwaleed\u2019s son Prince Khaled is married to the minister\u2019s daughter.\u201cThey must have uncovered evidence of irregular activity and wanted to make an example of him,\u201d Ali Shihabi, founder of the independent Arabia Foundation in Washington, said on Sunday from Abu Dhabi in a telephone interview.Others said there was bad blood between Prince Alwaleed and the crown prince. A former United States ambassador, Chas W. Freeman Jr., said it could be that Prince Alwaleed \u201chas been strongly identified in Saudi with civil society, which is by its very nature a counter to concentration of power.\u201d\u201cHe has a reputation,\u201d Mr. Freeman said, \u201cfor being quite outspoken and blunt and being critical of other parts of the royal family \u2014 and he\u2019s not well liked.\u201dOthers said they were surprised at the takedown of someone who has been an ambassador to international business.\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything about Alwaleed being politically active in a way that would threaten M.B.S.,\u201d said F. Gregory Gause III, an expert on Saudi Arabia and a professor at Texas A&M University, referring to the crown prince by his initials.Saudi Arabia is also trying to diversify its economy, a top priority of the crown prince. The kingdom is planning to list the state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco next year in what is expected to be the biggest initial public offering in history.He comes across in person as relaxed, not formal or rigid, and focused on business. A New York Times reporter who visited his office years ago found towering pictures of his daughter, without a head scarf. The prince\u2019s welcome was typical of his grand gestures: He presented the reporter, visiting in the days before the internet, with a full-length printout of The Times.More recently, Prince Alwaleed made early bets on some of the technology world\u2019s biggest stars, earning him handsome returns. He bought a strategic stake in JD.com, a Chinese online retailer, anticipating China\u2019s emergence as a vast e-commerce market.In moments of corporate crises, Prince Alwaleed has stepped in to tip the balance.When the phone hacking scandal rocked a London tabloid owned by the Murdochs, the prince went on the BBC to say that Rebekah Brooks, then the chief executive of the British unit of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation, should resign. \u201cYou bet she has to go,\u201d he said in July 2011. She resigned the next day.At the time, Prince Alwaleed was the second-biggest shareholder in News Corporation, with a more than 6 percent stake. He later sold most of his stake in the company.In the darkest hours of the 2008 financial crisis, Prince Alwaleed said he would increase his stake in Citigroup \u2014 a move of solidarity with the then-embattled bank\u2019s chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit.Prince Alwaleed has worked closely with some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest and best known banks and investors.Just a month ago, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, sat across from Prince Alwaleed at a meeting in Riyadh. The two talked about investments and economic developments in the Middle East. A longtime banker for Kingdom Holding, Goldman Sachs recently helped Prince Alwaleed\u2019s company acquire a 16 percent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi, the Saudi bank.Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and former government official who fled into exile during the summer, said Prince Alwaleed had lately become a vocal supporter of the crown prince\u2019s economic reforms and tried to persuade him to return to the country. Mr. Khashoggi said the prince sent him a text message saying, \u201cAn enlightened mind like you should be with us now building the fourth Saudi state under Mohammed bin Salman.\u201dBut Prince Mohammad appeared to have been keeping his distance, delaying four months before granting a requested meeting, Mr. Khashoggi said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m sure that hurt him.

The show, which will debut internationally on Dec. 1, centers on a small town plagued by strange goings-on at a nearby power facility. It also features an expansive cast of largely young actors, a time-warped structure and cryptic scenes of a teenager imprisoned in a brightly lit room.\u201cAll of the sudden there is an interest from the international audience,\u201d Mr. Odar said, \u201cthat, \u2018Oh, the Germans can do something more interesting than what they could do for many years.\u2019\u201d\u201cDark\u201d takes place in the fictional town of Winden (a play on the German word for \u201ctwists\u201d), whose forested surroundings are dominated by the cooling towers of a nuclear power plant. Its characters include Jonas Kahnwald (Louis Hofmann), a gloomy teenager still reeling from his father\u2019s suicide; Ulrich Nielsen (Oliver Masucci), a headstrong police officer having an affair with Jonas\u2019s mother; and Nielsen\u2019s wife, Katharina (J\u00f6rdis Triebel), who works at the local school. When a young boy disappears and a body is found in the woods, the resulting mystery seems to point to the nuclear plant.The rest of the lineup has long been heavy on political talk shows, middlebrow police dramas and second-rate TV movies. \u201cGermany has noticed that, when it comes to TV series, other countries are more advanced,\u201d Mr. Mikos said. \u201cNow people are trying to catch up.\u201dMr. Odar and Ms. Friese are aware that German television doesn\u2019t have the sexiest reputation. \u201cI think the perspective from outside is that we have very talented people working here, but what we\u2019ve been lacking is innovation,\u201d Ms. Friese said. They note that \u201cDark\u201d is a departure, not only because of its complex structure, but because it is a blend of two genres: crime and science fiction. \u201cThe problem is that Germans aren\u2019t really big with suspension of disbelief,\u201d Ms. Friese said. \u201cWe have to break this realism wall to create more innovative content.\u201d\u201cWe were uncool for a very long time,\u201d Mr. Odar said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s changing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Power Grid Sputters in Puerto Rico, Business Does Too", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUAYNABO, P.R. \u2014 Miriam Gonzalez stepped outside her shuttered restaurant in this municipality near San Juan and offered an exaggerated grin. \u201cThis is my happy face,\u201d Ms. Gonzalez, 52, said, her voice heavy with mockery. \u201cIt\u2019s a very happy face. We all have it on.\u201dEvery morning, Ms. Gonzalez puts on this happy face like a coat of makeup to ward off the depression that has festered since Hurricane Maria shut down her restaurant, trampled its well-tended garden and crushed her usually upbeat spirit.Like much of the island, she has gone without electricity since the storm hit on Sept. 20, making do with glowing lanterns, a gas barbecue grill, daily trips to the grocery store and wide open windows to stay cool. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\u2019s grid is working at less than 50 percent, leaving much of the island in the dark. For Ms. Gonzalez and other residents, the catastrophe of Hurricane Maria has been followed by an economic disaster with no end in sight.Manuel A. Laboy Rivera, the secretary of Puerto Rico\u2019s Department of Economic Development and Commerce estimated the economic losses at a minimum of $20 billion, although some economists and analysts put it as high as $40 billion, much of it from the drop in productivity. Puerto Rico\u2019s economy is already $70 billion in debt and will be hard hit by the steep drop in tax revenue.\u201cThe lack of power is the root of everything,\u201d Mr. Laboy Rivera said. \u201cThis is a very challenging time right now for Puerto Rico.\u2019\u2019Countless small businesses, like Ms. Gonzalez\u2019s, remain closed because they do not have power or a working generator (there is an epidemic of broken generators). On an island driven by tourism, many hotels are not open for guests. Manufacturers have operated in fits and starts.At the unemployment office in Bayam\u00f3n, about a 20-minute drive from Ms. Gonzalez\u2019s restaurant, hundreds line up every weekday morning to try to collect emergency unemployment benefits. More than 22,000 applied in October, compared with 6,800 in the same month last year, according to the Puerto Rico Department of Labor.Others are simply leaving the island: As of Tuesday, 156,000 people have arrived in Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Orlando, Fla., on planes from Puerto Rico since the storm. Many of them are professionals and middle-class workers who have fled the island because their jobs disappeared and they can no longer live without power. They are likely to stay on the mainland, a crushing blow to the island\u2019s fragile tax base and its ability to generate jobs. Government officials estimate that as many as 300,000 people on an island with 3.4 million could eventually leave.Kesia Rivera, 29, who used to manage an insurance company, is thinking about joining her five brothers and sisters on the mainland. \u201cI have a lot of expenses,\u201d she said as she waited to fill out an application.\u201cThere\u2019s food. The kids\u2019 stuff. My car was damaged by bad gas and I can\u2019t fix it because it\u2019s expensive. I don\u2019t have a job, and I don\u2019t have money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find jobs right now; businesses don\u2019t have money to pay employees.\u201dChuck Watson, director of research and development at Enki Research, a disaster research and modeling company, said the lack of electricity had severely compounded Puerto Rico\u2019s economic challenges. He called the government\u2019s goal to restore power by mid-December \u201cbeyond wishful thinking.\u201dWithout power, the economic losses will quickly multiply, Mr. Watson said.\u201cOnce you uproot from Puerto Rico and come to the U.S. mainland, are you really going to want to go back, given the other issues, like the Puerto Rican government and the unemployment, a number that will be catastrophic?\u201d he said. \u201cIn New Orleans, there is a lot that left after Katrina and never came back.\u201dTourism is among the hardest hit, Mr. Laboy Rivera said. About 30 percent of hotels remain closed, a number that has improved in the past two weeks. The loss in convention money is considerable, Mr. Laboy Rivera said. Most hotels that are open continue to house hurricane relief workers.Manufacturing, which makes up 48 percent of the island\u2019s economy and accounts for a third of the tax revenue, was bedeviled by the lack of power, structural damage, debris-strewn roads and, most recently, generator breakdowns. Many businesses, including pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical-device companies, have struggled to reach their pre-hurricane production and shipping goals, although the situation is rapidly improving.\u201cThese companies have options, and the moment you start putting at risk the global supply chain, you have a big problem,\u201d Mr. Laboy Rivera said.Restaurants are either booming or flailing. Cooking at home without power is not easy, so restaurants with generators have plenty of business. But many suffered structural damage, did not have generators that were powerful enough or could not fix them when they broke.The Association of Restaurants in Puerto Rico said that about 1,800 of its 5,000 member restaurants, including some belonging to major chains, have not yet reopened. Generator breakdowns often prompt restaurants to close abruptly and repair parts can take weeks to arrive. A large new generator can cost upward of $40,000. It remains unclear how many of the smaller restaurants will be able to reopen, said Ramon Leal, the group\u2019s president.\u201cSome days we open 50 restaurants and close 50 restaurants,\u201d Mr. Leal said. The bigger problem, he said, is \u201cwe are losing tons of people from the restaurant industry. They are moving to Miami, Orlando, Atlanta, New York.\u201dJust as worrisome as the exodus, said Mr. Laboy Rivera, is the blow to the island\u2019s small and medium businesses, which provide 80 percent of the jobs. These include accounting companies, advertisers, hair salons, law offices, media, medical labs and retail stores. As many as 50,000 of these businesses had not reopened as of the beginning of the month, he estimated.On Calle Esmeralda, a once-busy commercial strip, Ms. Gonzalez\u2019s charming farm-to-table restaurant, Believe, had flourished before Maria, taking in up to $4,000 a day. Now she makes a fraction of that cooking hamburgers and shish kebabs on a portable grill out front, where locals sip beer on plastic chairs.Ms. Gonzalez had a small generator for a couple of days but it broke down. She has waited weeks for repair parts and worries that the package, like so many others, might get stolen. Even if it arrives, finding someone to fix the generator is almost impossible. So is buying a new one.The low point, she said, was laying off her 15 employees.\u201cThat killed me,\u201d she said. \u201cI would lie here,\u201d she added, stretching out on a bench, \u201cwith quartz on my forehead, chest and stomach, asking for electricity. I went to church, and I\u2019m not a church person. I sat there and said, \u2018Please bring the power back.\u2019 \u201d Ms. Gonzalez said she cried so much she \u201cdried up.\u201dMany nearby stores are closed, she said. At Peekaboo, a printing and school supply shop across the street, the owners said they had no plans to reopen. They have no generator and are afraid of being robbed. Next door, at Brain Games, the owner is on the mainland, unsure of whether to reopen. A spa and a restaurant across the street are dark.Not all suffer equally. Hurricanes reward some industries, like construction, which had been moribund here for a decade. But the real boom is in joblessness.Leisha Otero drove from Morovis, a mountain town turned inside out by Hurricane Maria, to the unemployment line in Bayam\u00f3n. Having lost her small house and her $10-an-hour job as a practical nurse at a medical lab in Vega Alta, she came for news on her application for lost wages. But there was no word, only instructions to wait for a letter of approval from the federal government.\u201cI\u2019m a nurse, a stylist, a nail technician,\u201d she said, as her two children scrolled through photos on her cellphone.Ms. Otero\u2019s 11-year-old son, who has epilepsy, contracted a bacterial disease from rodents shortly after the storm. His fever spiked at 103, he couldn\u2019t stop vomiting and his lips were gray. She rushed him to the hospital. He is fine now, but she worries that his epilepsy medicine will run out and that his doctors will leave for the mainland. And, without a job, she has no health insurance.Her husband has already left, for Boston, where he found work in a factory. Her brother, a nurse, and his wife left for North Carolina. Ms. Otero said she had no choice. After stopping at the unemployment office, she would head for the airport with her children to reserve flights to Boston.\u201cIt hurts my heart, seeing this all destroyed, and I love it so much,\u201d Ms. Otero said. \u201cWho knows when the businesses will reopen? They were already struggling before the storm.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scenes From Sears: 2 Locations Tell a Story of Struggle in a Tight Retail Market", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHILLIPSBURG, N.J. \u2014 Every year on Black Friday, Angela Buzatto has come to Sears to buy two new vacuum cleaners, at steep discounts, for her house cleaning business. This year she was going to buy four of them.Ms. Buzatto couldn\u2019t resist. The Sears in the Phillipsburg Mall is closing its doors for good and everything has to go. Along with vacuums on sale at even bigger discounts, she bought her 8-year-old daughter a shimmering white dress for $24 and a $10 pair of fuzzy blue shoes.Black Friday is the most celebrated shopping day of the year, when parking lots fill up early with bargain hunters and online frenzy crashes the websites of even the most established retailers. In Los Angeles, a line formed overnight at a sneaker boutique on Melrose Avenue, and a throng of shoppers stood behind fences in the early morning darkness waiting to get into the Mall of America near Minneapolis.But for Ms. Buzatto, standing in a dim hallway in the Phillipsburg Mall, it was a different scene. Next to Sears were rows of empty storefronts for retailers like Payless Shoes and Radio Shack, both of which have gone through bankruptcy.The bleak scene was emblematic of the difficult challenges confronting many brick and mortar retailers, which are struggling to figure out how to survive Amazon\u2019s seemingly unstoppable march to dominate the American wallet.Analysts say retailers are expected to close more stores this year than at any time since the 2008 recession. The pressure from e-commerce, coupled with many retailers loading up on debt during better days, has led to a string of bankruptcies this year. Thousands of retail workers have lost their jobs. Overall employment in the retail industry has been declining since July \u2014 which economists say is highly unusual given that the economy is relatively strong.All the ingredients are in place for a strong shopping season \u2014 low unemployment, a soaring stock market, and high consumer confidence. Holiday sales are projected to increase by as much as 4 percent from a year ago, to $682 billion, according to the National Retail Federation.And yet these positive conditions come at a vulnerable time for many retailers, as they try to adjust their business model from a legacy of operating hundreds of stores in suburban malls to a more adept online operation.Sears is determined to survive the turmoil, despite falling sales and a stock price that now trades for less than $4.Even as Sears is closing stores, the company is opening some new ones and renovating others to make them smaller and more attractive. The company has a deal with Uber in which drivers receive significant discounts at Sears.One of the company\u2019s remodeled stores, in Wayne, N.J., was bustling on Friday morning. An employee in a red vest greeted shoppers at the door, handing out a circular showcasing the biggest deals. By noon, the checkout line was wrapped around racks of one-piece fleece pajamas and winter coats.As it works on a turnaround, Sears is paying down its debt, cutting costs and integrating its online and bricks and mortar operations to give customers more choices in how they shop.\u201cWe are fighting like hell,\u201d the Sears chairman, Edward Lampert, said in a statement earlier this year.One cost-cutting measure is closing stores. Sears announced earlier this month that it was closing the Phillipsburg store. When that store opened at 7 a.m. for its last Black Friday, the parking lot out front was empty \u2014 except for a minivan and a white pickup truck.A man in a hooded sweatshirt stood next to the truck, then hurried inside.Red and yellow banners reading \u201cStore Closing Sale\u201d and \u201cNothing Held Back\u201d hung from the ceiling.Throughout the store, tables of shirts, pants and sweaters were neatly arranged and most of them fully stocked. A display of patriotic-themed shirts featuring wolves and eagles were selling for 40 percent off. Snowmen scarves, originally $5.99, were selling for about $3.The scarves caught the eye of Elaine Freeman, who was browsing for Christmas gifts with her sister Faith, while their car was being serviced at the Sears automotive center.The sisters grew up coming to the Sears with their parents, and they wanted to show their loyalty by shopping there one last Black Friday.Ms. Freeman, who works at a medical billing firm, said she has always been able to buy things at Sears that she cannot find at other large retailers. Just this week, she said, her niece needed a roasting pan large enough for the turkey she was planning to cook for Thanksgiving.\u201cIt\u2019s Black Friday, people are shopping elsewhere, but we are choosing to be here,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Freeman said.At around 7:45 a.m., Tyler Kwiecinski, 21, and Zoe Vallese, 19, wandered into the store and headed toward the appliance section. For decades, Sears has built a loyal customer base attracted to its Kenmore brands of stoves, microwaves and air-conditioners.But these young friends had never been inside a Sears \u2014 at least not that they could remember. They had gotten up early that morning to hit GameStop, a video game store at the other end of the mall, and were curious when they saw the big yellow \u201cStore Closing\u2019\u2019 sign outside Sears.\u201cMy dad explained to me that Sears was like Walmart before Walmart arrived,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Kwiecinski, who left without buying anything.Not far from the appliances was a stand of artificial Christmas trees of different varieties like the \u201cWestchester Slim Cashmere Pine.\u201d One of the trees was spinning, as its white lights blinked. They were all on sale for 30 percent off.Nancy Hartman and her daughter Jennifer Verdicchio have shopped at Sears on Black Friday for as long as they can remember. On Friday, Ms. Hartman peered into one of the empty, darkened storefronts next to the Sears.\u201cI took my grandson to this mall recently and he asked me \u2018Nana, why are the stores closing?\u2019\u201d Ms. Hartman said. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing.\u201dAbout 65 miles away from the Phillipsburg Mall, the Sears in Wayne was in a different world. The store has new merchandising displays, checkout counters and sleek lighting. The building exterior has fresh white and blue signage.Victoria Setzer shopped for boys\u2019 clothing in the Wayne store on Friday around noon. Her parents met at a Sears in the 1960s, while her mother was working for the catalog.\u201cThere is so much history and tradition, it\u2019s a piece of Americana,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Setzer said.But her loyalty to Sears has been tested after her recently purchased Kenmore refrigerator needed repairs twice.\u201cI hope it survives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if they can.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect name for a video game store at the Phillipsburg Mall in New Jersey. It is GameStop, not Game Stopper.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Marcellus');\nMany people think of Africa as the sole source of diamonds, but since the precious gems were discovered in the NWT in the early 1990s, Canada has emerged globally as the third-largest diamond producer. And today, a growing community of Northern female miners reflects a modern industry set in one of the most remote and sublime corners of the world.\nFor eight months out of the year, when temperatures bottom out at 50 below, the Arctic tundra of the NWT is blanketed in snow, lichen-covered rock and little else. But deep beneath the permafrost, embedded in dark columns of igneous rock called kimberlite, diamonds await. Ranging from one- to three-billion-years old, the gems are formed about 100 miles under the Earth\u2019s surface from carbon exposed to extreme pressure and temperatures around 2,000 degrees. By the time volcanic eruptions push them to the planet\u2019s surface, diamonds are the hardest naturally occurring substance known to\u00a0man.\u201cIf you protect the land, the land will protect you \u2014 that's a common saying when you speak to any elder,\u201d says Balsillie, 31, who grew up in Yellowknife as a M\u00e9tis, a group descended from First Nations people and early European settlers. When the mines began opening in the late 1990s, strict guidelines were put in place to respect both the land and the indigenous communities. \u201cIt's a lot of work, but it's necessary,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have three golden rules: zero harm, continual improvement and resource compliance.\u201dBecause of its climate and remote nature, the cost of living in the Northwest Territories is high. Balsillie remembers a \u201clow pulse\u201d in Yellowknife during her high school years. \u201cPeople were moving away. Maybe there were a couple gold mines here and there, and exploration, but it was definitely in a funk,\u201d she says. Her mother, who had moved north for work when she was a young woman, considered leaving. But then, she says, \u201cdiamonds were discovered, and that changed everything.\u201d The economy boomed, and the city rebounded.The diamond mines look to hire as many Northern residents as possible \u2014 particularly indigenous peoples \u2014 and the local communities have experienced an upswing. After years of earning hourly wages as an office worker in the town of Hay River, Kelly Lafferty-Norn, now 35, also M\u00e9tis, decided to take an intro-to-mining course. When it came time to driving trucks, she was a natural. In 2012, she joined Diavik Diamond Mine, where she continues to be one of the top haul-truck operators and earns a very competitive salary. \u201cThe work is always interesting,\u201d says Lafferty-Norn. \u201cI learn something new just about every rotation.\u201dLafferty-Norn is on a \u201ctwo-and-two\u201d shift, meaning she works a two-weeks-on, two-weeks-off schedule, driving ore from the mine to the processing plant. It\u2019s no longer unusual for women to drive 60-ton haul trucks at the mines, but women, who make up nearly 30 percent of the workforce, have always been critical to the diamond industry: Two female geologists made the first discovery of kimberlite in Russia, and a female geologist discovered the world's largest known diamond deposit near Lake Argyle in\u00a0Australia. Working 12-hour shifts, 14 days straight at a remote site isn\u2019t easy, even with perks like a 24-hour cafeteria, a gym and classes on public speaking or financial planning. But, says Balsillie, \u201cit\u2019s a little family up here, so you\u2019re not just going somewhere and working. You\u2019re not just a number.\u201d  And many embrace both the intensity and the freedom of the schedule. Lafferty-Norn, a mother of four, says, \u201cEspecially in the summertime, we can just jump in the truck and go wherever we want because we don't have to worry about going back to work for a week or\u00a0so.\u201d  The mines operate 24-7, 365 days a year to excavate diamonds. For many workers, the stones are worth more than carats and dollars \u2014 they also represent their \u201cdiamond dream.\u201d Balsillie says, \u201cIt is how you fuel your life with your job.\u201d And it\u2019s allowed workers like Megan Rodel \u2014 who started in production mining and is now in charge of optimizing work flows as Gahcho Ku\u00e9\u2019s business improvement superintendent \u2014 greater opportunity. \u201cA lot of people have been here for a while and may not have only been in one job. You can start and be a heavy equipment operator. And then you can get an apprenticeship and become an electrician. You can become a supervisor. You don't have to look elsewhere for a career.\u201d \u201cThe world feels much bigger and open out on the Arctic tundra,\u201d says Rodel, of her adopted Canadian home. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juxtaposition to South Africa.\u201d Rodel grew up and studied mining engineering there, an entirely opposite landscape where diamonds have played an important role for more than a century. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up in the mining industry. And I\u2019ve always wanted to work in diamonds,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just replace diamonds from one area with another, because they\u2019re not exactly the same. It\u2019s not like a gold bar, where it doesn\u2019t matter where it comes from. Diamonds are unique. That\u2019s really special.\u201dPhotography by Kiana HayeriThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Edward Herman, 92, Critic of U.S. Media and Foreign Policy, Dies", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEdward Herman, an economist who joined the linguist Noam Chomsky in accusing the United States of foreign policy hypocrisy and the mass media of complicity in parroting government propaganda, died on Nov. 11 in Penn Valley, Pa., near Philadelphia. He was 92.The cause was complications of bladder cancer, his wife, Christine Abbott, said.Dr. Herman was primarily responsible for the manifesto \u201cManufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media\u201d (1988), which he wrote with Professor Chomsky. It concluded that \u201cmarket forces, internalized assumptions and self-censorship\u201d motivate newspapers and television networks to stifle dissent.Dr. Herman, who was less reticent than Professor Chomsky about challenging the political left as well as more familiar conservative targets, was not immune from criticism himself.\u201cIf we consider mainstream media to be nothing but propagandistic,\u201d said the author Todd Gitlin, a journalism and sociology professor at Columbia University, \u201cwe have no vocabulary left to condemn the likes of Fox News and Breitbart.\u201dStill, the public-affairs scholar Derek N. Shearer wrote in The Los Angeles Times in 1988 that for its case studies alone, \u201cManufacturing Consent\u201d \u201cshould be required reading for future foreign correspondents and foreign editors at leading schools of journalism and public affairs.\u201dOne case study, for example, asked why a single Polish priest murdered by the Communists was more newsworthy than another cleric killed by a Washington-sponsored Latin American dictator.Dr. Herman and Professor Chomsky were severely criticized over the years as soft-pedaling evidence of genocide in Cambodia, Rwanda and, during the Bosnia war, Srebrenica.They argued that in assessing the killings they were seeking an accurate count rather than relying on unreliable reports by survivors. In the civil wars in Rwanda and Bosnia, they said, the victors had exaggerated the toll to justify their rise to power and their pro-Western policies.In the case of Cambodia, they said, the toll had been overstated by enemies of the brutal Khmer Rouge Communist regime, which, the authors wrote, had \u201cdealt with fundamental problems rooted in the feudal past and exacerbated by the imperial system.\u201dAmong their critics was Professor Gitlin, who wrote in an email, \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to their Manichaean view of the world that the suffering of the Cambodians is less important than their need to pin the damage done to Cambodia in the 1970s primarily on the American bombing that preceded the rise of the Khmer Rouge to power \u2014 bombing that was indeed heinous, ruinous, and did contribute to the rise of the Khmer Rouge, but that was only the prologue to the horrendous crimes that followed at the hands of the Khmer Rouge.\u201dFor example, he noted that the authors acknowledged that despite the supposedly omnipotent media propaganda system, \u201can active grass-roots oppositional movement with very limited media access\u201d was pivotal in undermining President Ronald Reagan\u2019s efforts to aid right-wing rebel groups in Nicaragua. But \u201cthe only explanation they offer for this apparent anomaly,\u201d Professor LaFeber added, \u201cis that the \u2018system is not all-powerful.\u2019 \u201dDr. Herman\u2019s articles, interviews, letters and nearly 20 books defied popular convention and animated public debate on a broad range of issues, including corporate power, human rights and wars waged by the United States in Vietnam and Iraq.Thomas Ferguson, a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, said of Dr. Herman\u2019s studies in an email, \u201cSome of these have been very controversial, but whatever you thought of them, many, such as the discussions of Vietnam, helped stimulate a rethinking of the real consequences of policies that many citizens knew very little about.\u201dAnd Professor Chomsky himself wrote, also in an email, of his sometime collaborator\u2019s \u201cscrupulous, diligent and comprehensive research; a keen instinct for detecting and exposing hypocrisy and deceit and the effects of conformity to doctrine; and a recognition of the role of institutional structures in shaping interpretation and analysis.\u201dEdward Samuel Herman was born on April 7, 1925, in Philadelphia to Abraham Lincoln Herman, a pharmacist, and the former Celia Dektor.His wife, the former Mary Woody, died in 2013. In addition to Ms. Abbott, a longtime friend whom he married in 2015, he is survived by a brother, Harris. A sister, Barbara Herman Becker, died this year.Dr. Herman earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in economics at the University of Pennsylvania and a doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley, where he was inspired by the research into fascist economic systems done by Professor Robert A.

{"Headline": "Travel Books Take You There and Back", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoundupSure, Freya Stark risked life and limb traveling through Persia to give us her classic \u201cThe Valleys of the Assassins,\u201d and the indomitable Dervla Murphy has been to, and written about, almost everywhere, often with her daughter in tow (and sometimes a mule), but all too often the luxurious chore of travel writing has belonged to the men. So it\u2019s worth noting that some of this season\u2019s most exciting travel narratives are by women.With lyrical economy, she recalls the summers of her childhood along \u201cEurope\u2019s southernmost Iron Curtain,\u201d where \u201cevery second barman was in the service of the Bulgarian State Security.\u201d But upon her return, Kassabova discovers that the \u201cred Riviera\u201d of her youth has given way to a land of misfits lingering in a limbo of fading hope and warped memory. The picture she paints is one of a place out of time, a forgotten, singular, in-between land. A local bar owner notes, \u201cLiving here is like a joke without a punch line.\u201d Yet this is also a place that clearly intoxicates Kassabova, and leaving is \u201clike pulling myself out with a corkscrew.\u201dMaking her way west through northern Thrace, Kassabova encounters \u201ca hub for \u2026 desperados and smugglers.\u201d Along the high passes of the Rhodope Mountains, things are so treacherous that \u201cyou would biodegrade at the bottom of the gorge and vultures would pick your bones clean.\u201d This is a land of curses, of mysterious fireballs in the sky that may or may not be dragons, and of dancing priests.It\u2019s not surprising that Kassabova \u2014 who has written three poetry collections, a novel and three memoirs \u2014 demonstrates a descriptive sensitivity on the page (climbing in the mountains, she feels \u201cthe pitiless sun hammering my head like a judgment for some distant crime\u201d). But she also possesses the gift that\u2019s bestowed on only the best of travel writers: an ability to zero in on characters who illuminate the condition of a place at a moment in time.At one point, Kassabova comes across a fortuneteller who answers her secret, unasked question. \u201cWhat you have begun you will complete,\u201d the woman, reading a handful of tossed beans, assures her, \u201cbut you must heed the signs along the way. Never ever ignore the signs.\u201d Luckily for both author and reader, Kassabova seems indeed to have heeded every sign and missed nothing along the way.Bunting follows in a long tradition of English writers escaping up to the region where the land fractures and frays. To her predecessors, she notes, \u201cthe Hebrides offered \u2026 an unusual degree of personal freedom from convention and class.\u201d It was on Jura, with a population of fewer than 200, that George Orwell retreated to write \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four.\u201d Bunting makes a pilgrimage to where he \u201cset up his typewriter in front of the window overlooking the sea, and with that vista in front of him, he infused the novel with a pervasive horror of the dirty, urban tedium of its setting.\u201d Later she reminds us that it was on the wind-battered island of Iona that Irish monks seeking a hermit\u2019s life gave the world the magnificent gift of \u201cThe Book of Kells.\u201dHistory along this coast, Bunting notes early on, \u201cis unruly, and does not fit into an orderly narrative.\u201d Eventually, though, that history, \u201cmute with trauma,\u201d speaks forcibly to her: \u201cI had encountered multiple types of loss on my journey: of land, language, country and nation.\u201d Her travels culminate in a visit to the Hebrides\u2019 most iconic ruin, St. Kilda. After centuries of habitation, the final 36 residents requested evacuation from this remotest of communities in 1930. For Bunting, the loss still reverberates.Running under her entire narrative are the feelings Bunting has for her homeland, England, and for the larger entity of Britain. It\u2019s this relationship that\u2019s eventually called into question and cuts deepest. She has justifiable difficulty reconciling, among other injustices, the removal of people from their land at the hands of the Crown during the 18th and 19th centuries: \u201cNo other country in Europe witnessed such brutal clearances.\u201d This larger reckoning is what ultimately gives \u201cLove of Country\u201d its power and resonance. After all, what is love \u2014 of people, institutions or country \u2014 but the attempt to reconcile what cannot be easily reconciled?The story picks up in the early 1970s in the midst of the long South American \u201cdream honeymoon\u201d of FitzGerald and her new husband, Fitz. That they survive a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle, then escape a penal colony, only sets the stage for their real troubles.Making their way to freedom in the backwater of Puerto Maldonado, the couple learn that they\u2019re stranded. It\u2019s then that a mysterious, well-dressed stranger approaches their table at a local restaurant. \u201cI can\u2019t help but overhear your difficulty,\u201d he begins. The man, who turns out to be a gold prospector, suggests they use a raft and float the five days downriver to Riberalta, gateway to points beyond. \u201cNo harm can come to you,\u201d he insists.Trouble arrives that first night. Unable to steer the raft in the powerful current, they miss the border checkpoint into Bolivia and shots tear through the darkness into their makeshift tent. But soon the days and nights are blissful. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve ever felt so liberated,\u201d FitzGerald recalls.Then, on the fourth night, a drenching lightning storm hits. A tree collapses on the raft, missing FitzGerald\u2019s head by inches. They almost sink in the tempest but manage to escape. Dawn brings the discovery that their raft has been taken far off course \u2014 they\u2019re stranded deep in a swamp that rises during the rainy season. Worse, their supply of food has been lost.In this world of water, the FitzGeralds struggle in vain to find their way back to the river\u2019s current. They endure fire ants, suffer sunstroke and nearly drown in sucking mud. They sleep in a tree. Fear of attack by caiman, jaguar and piranha is constant. Strange glowing eyes peer at them nightly from the jungle. Bees swarm over every inch of their bodies \u2014 something they become nearly immune to.And they starve, for page after harrowing page, for 26 days, until they are come upon \u2014 near death, emaciated \u2014 by two Indians out hunting for turtles. The couple endure, maintaining hope and affection for each other. It\u2019s this that elevates \u201cRuthless River\u201d above the typically heroic tale of survival. In simple, unsentimental terms, Holly FitzGerald has given us a most unlikely love story.The latest book\u2019s editor, Lavinia Spalding, hungry for travelers who \u201cgo with an open heart\u201d and have \u201cthe inclination to practice human kindness, a sincere intention to build pathways of understanding and a willingness to be transformed,\u201d read nearly 500 submissions before settling on the 31 stories that make up this diverse collection.In the opener, Zora O\u2019Neill finds herself drawn away from a resort\u2019s placid blue waters and toward the newly formed refugee camps that have sprung up on the Greek island she and her family visit every year. Like so many of the stories here, \u201cOn the Migrant Trail\u201d is told with simple grace. O\u2019Neill\u2019s account demonstrates once again that history\u2019s first draft is often written by the intrepid traveler.As a young woman, she is led by her hunger for enlightenment to the island of Corfu. There she falls in love for the first time \u2014 not only with a man but, after an epiphany at the sight of an egg fried in olive oil, with the deep pleasures of good food simply prepared. Upon her return to America, health problems force her further in the direction of conscious eating, and her fate is sealed at a San Francisco farmers\u2019 market \u201cone Saturday morning in spring when a farmer held out a pea to me and changed my world.\u201dHuber is prone to such pronouncements and the reader might be excused for slipping into cynicism, except for Huber\u2019s wholehearted belief in her path. Finding her soul mate, Christopher, she sets out to make a career of her ardor for food. Passion carries the day over pragmatism and the two \u2014 victims of wanderlust \u2014 are off to Costa Rica, Paris, Guatemala, Italy, even Minnesota. Eventually Huber meets a man who might be called \u2014 to slip into the parlance of this charming foodie\u2019s travel memoir \u2014 her guardian angel, the chef Bruce Aidells, who magically appears at key moments and helps Huber land a job as a recipe tester.Although Huber wears her zeal and her spiritual beliefs on her sleeve as she moves from one inspiration to the next, she\u2019s endearing, engaging company and the reader roots for her success. Eventually Huber and Christopher adopt a baby, victories begin to accumulate, and the three approach a happy ending that Huber knows is merely another new beginning in her larger journey.\u201cThere has always been romance in distance,\u201d she reminds us. Yet it\u2019s the push-pull of the desire to leave coupled with the \u201cstrong attachment to the comfort, the privacy, the intimacy, and the pride of home\u201d that has shaped Freed\u2019s life. \u201cThe rhythm of leaving and returning has kept me nicely unsettled for over 45 years.\u201d Without it, she confesses, \u201cI would have drowned any desire to write in restlessness and despair.\u201dFreed approaches the world \u2014 and her prose \u2014 with the cleareyed, forthright wonder required of the most committed of travelers. In the essay \u201cKeeping Watch,\u201d she recalls growing up \u201cluxurious but not rich, safe and yet threatened, carefree if one did not think too carefully about the future,\u201d in apartheid-era South Africa, and of her childhood terrors at the prospect of a \u201cKnife-at-the-Throat day\u201d when the servants might \u201crise as one.\u201dElsewhere she speaks eloquently of travel\u2019s power to transform: \u201cThe traveling writer is someone seeking \u2026 a sort of non-existence, the quest for which can lead, paradoxically, to the discovery of the self set free from the bafflement of context.\u201d And in the deceptively economic essay called \u201cLocked In,\u201d she reminds us just how perilous it sometimes is to be a woman in the world, no matter how seemingly placid the setting.Freed is also one of the funniest writers around. And in \u201cUseful Zulu Phrases, 1986,\u201d the laugh gets caught in the throat as she offers a hilarious list of some of the helpful hints that were once offered white South Africans attempting to learn Zulu in order to better command and control their black servants. In \u201cCaveat Viator,\u201d she gives us a blistering, bone-true indictment of new age man\u2019s self-aggrandizing struggles to be at harmony with the natural world \u2014 from Northern California to Africa.In this marvelous collection\u2019s final essay, \u201cWhen Enough Is Enough,\u201d Freed may be speaking for road warriors everywhere when she confesses to the occasional urge to \u201cflee the things and the people that seem to hold me in place, to grab what\u2019s left of the life and make a run for it.\u201dAndrew McCarthy is the author of the young adult novel \u201cJust Fly Away\u201d and the travel memoir \u201cThe Longest Way Home.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On the ground, it came sweeping in from the Katy Prairie some 30 miles west of downtown.Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point.How climate change is challenging the world\u2019s urban centers.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.Water drains naturally in this stretch of Texas, or at least it used to. At more than 600 square miles, Houston has grown to be as big as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia combined, a giant spread of asphalt smothering many of the floodplains that once shuttled water from the prairies to the sea. When finished, the newest road to ring the city and propel its expansion, called the Grand Parkway, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island.For years, the local authorities turned a blind eye to runaway development. Thousands of homes have been built next to, and even inside, the boundaries of the two big reservoirs devised by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1940s after devastating floods. Back then, Houston was 20 miles downstream, its population 400,000. Today, these reservoirs are smack in the middle of an urban agglomeration of six million.The story of Harvey, Houston and the city\u2019s difficult path forward is a quintessentially American tale. Time and again, America has bent the land to its will, imposing the doctrine of Manifest Destiny on nature\u2019s most daunting obstacles. We have bridged the continent with railways and roads, erected cities in the desert, and changed the course of rivers.Built on a mosquito-infested Texas swamp, Houston similarly willed itself into a great city. It is the country\u2019s energy capital, home to oil and carbon-producing giants, to the space industry, medical research and engineers of every stripe. Its sprawl of highways and single-family homes is a postwar version of the American dream.Unfortunately, nature always gets the last word. Houston\u2019s growth contributed to the misery Harvey unleashed. The very forces that pushed the city forward are threatening its way of life.Sprawl is only part of the story. Houston is also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Many Texans regard this as the key to prosperity, an antidote to Washington. It encapsulates a potent vision of an unfettered America.Harvey called that concept into question. It may have been an unusually bad hurricane, dumping trillions of gallons of water in a few days, even more to the east of the city than to the west, in the prairie, and setting all kinds of records. But it was also the third big storm to slam Houston in three years, dispelling any notion that Houston shouldn\u2019t expect more of the same.Cypress CreekAddicksReservoirHOUSTONBarkerReservoirBuffalo BayouBuildings DamagedBy Hurricane HarveyBrays BayouThousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain.100-year floodplainProperties with flood damage inHurricane Harvey        Cypress CreekAddicksReservoirHOUSTONBuffalo BayouBarkerReservoirBuildings Damaged byHurricane HarveyBrays BayouThousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain.100-year floodplainProperties with flood damage inHurricane Harvey        Buildings Damaged By Hurricane HarveyAddicksReservoirHOUSTONBarkerReservoirThousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain.100-year floodplainProperties with flood damage inHurricane Harvey        Cypress CreekAddicksReservoirHOUSTONBarkerReservoirBuffalo BayouBraysBayouBuildings DamagedBy Hurricane HarveyThousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain.100-year floodplainProperties with flood damage inHurricane Harvey        By The New York TimesThat said, scientists have little doubt that climate change is making storms worse and more frequent. The floods that ravaged Houston on Memorial Day in 2015 and in April of 2016 \u2014 now called the Tax Day flood \u2014 left behind billions of dollars in damage. Coming right after those events, Harvey has led even some pro-development enthusiasts to rethink the city and its surroundings.Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.\u201cThree 500-year floods in three years means either we\u2019re free and clear for the next 1,500 years,\u201d as he put it, \u201cor something has seriously changed.\u201dAfter every natural calamity, American politicians make big promises. They say: We will rebuild. We will not be defeated. Never again will we be caught unprepared.But they rarely tackle the toughest obstacles. The hard truth, scientists say, is that climate change will increasingly require moving \u2014 not just rebuilding \u2014 entire neighborhoods, reshaping cities, even abandoning coastlines.Resettling neighborhoods, making certain places off-limits to development, creating dikes and reservoirs is difficult, both financially and politically. It takes longer than most election cycles. Memories fade. Inertia sets in. Residents just want to get their lives back to normal. Politicians want votes, not trouble.After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans, for better and worse, used its cataclysm as an opportunity to reboot, not just fixing levees but overhauling public schools, hospitals and many neighborhoods. It was a wrenching process. The mere suggestion of moving people out of vulnerable neighborhoods set off bitter protests, causing the city to back down from some of its most sweeping proposals.Texas after Harvey is no different, and perhaps even less prepared to change. Like the rest of America, it is deeply divided between urban and rural, Democrat and Republican. Houston is a blue city with a black mayor in a bright red state. Here, especially in the hurricane\u2019s wake, debates over the way ahead have split conservatives from one another and put environmentalists at odds with advocates of affordable housing.Ultimately, though, any resolution will require that everyone face the same threats together.Jim Blackburn, a planner, environmental lawyer and something of a lightning rod around here, has been warning for years about climate change, the decrepit state of Houston\u2019s reservoirs and the perils of developing the Katy Prairie. He remembers escaping years ago to the prairie to bird watch. One recent morning he drove me out there along the Grand Parkway and pulled into an unfinished subdivision.A saleswoman in a model home boasted about $1 billion worth of box stores and malls being built nearby. The development, she said, adheres to county standards requiring that houses be raised above the 100-year floodplain. The woman handed Mr. Blackburn a glossy brochure and a disclaimer, which he scanned before climbing back into the car, shaking his head.The disclaimer explained that roads outside the development, linking it to the parkway, occupy the 10-year floodplain, meaning they would have about a 10 percent chance of flooding every year.\u201cThese days that means they\u2019ll flood anytime you look at them funny,\u201d Mr. Blackburn said. \u201cIt\u2019s the new normal.\u201dThat\u2019s not far-off. The number of \u201cheavy precipitation\u201d events in the United States has skyrocketed since the 1960s. Since 1980, instances of extreme weather \u2014 hurricanes, floods, heat waves \u2014 linked to climate change have cost the United States $1.1 trillion. Studies show that for every dollar spent upfront in preparedness, American taxpayers could save $4 in emergency relief and reconstruction \u2014 not counting health costs, the impact of lost jobs and business revenues and incalculable grief.But that requires politicians to agree.\u201cWe suffered nothing short of a catastrophic disaster,\u201d a veteran Texas lobbyist, Bill Miller, said. \u201cIt happens at a time when the people in the governing class in this state don\u2019t believe in taxes and government. But they also don\u2019t want anybody discouraged from coming here, because that\u2019s bad for business.\u201dAn upbeat narrative casts business-friendly Texas in the loner role of swashbuckling cowboy, disdainful of coastal elites. \u201cDon\u2019t California my Texas\u201d has become a rallying cry for Republican state lawmakers and a theme repeated by the governor, Greg Abbott, who has complained about \u201ca patchwork quilt of bans and rules and regulations that is eroding the Texas model.\u201dHe believes cities are the culprit. For years, Texas Republicans promoted local controls to push against federal court orders on issues like desegregation and same-sex marriage. Now state leaders have made a U-turn. Mr. Abbott has complained about \u201cpolitical demagogues using climate change as an excuse to remake the American economy.\u201d At a Republican gathering in June, he talked about the experience of driving out of the state\u2019s capital, Austin.\u201cIt starts smelling different,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cAnd you know what that fragrance is? Freedom.\u201dLittle wonder, post-Harvey, that state and local officials have anointed different flood and recovery czars. Texas is sounding these days like Russia under the Romanovs. The system ensures nobody is clearly in charge.Least of all in Houston. A bill that would have allowed Harris County merely to issue the equivalent of parking tickets to developers violating floodplain regulations \u2014 the sort of regulations that control flooding \u2014 was vetoed by the governor. Two other bills to study flooding in the Houston region, introduced in the last legislative session, died in committee.I met with the mayor in City Hall at the time. He noted that the Legislature had convened a special session to ban gender-neutral bathrooms. \u201cIf they can meet about toilets, why can\u2019t they meet when the toilets overflow?\u201d one frustrated city official said, before Mr. Abbott came up with $50 million from a separate fund to stem growing criticism.Another official, this one with the county, made the point that the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes.\u201cThe whole trans-Mississippi pioneer enterprise was in fact brought to you by the federal government,\u201d says Steven Conn, a historian and author of \u201cAmericans Against the City.\u201dThe hypocrisy of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, resisting federal aid to the New York region after Hurricane Sandy but then requesting it for Texas after Harvey, is in fact part of this same history.Houston\u2019s unregulated sprawl, Mr. Conn added, gives physical form to this politics of \u201cdecentralization and anti-statism.\u201dAt the same time, Houston is in many ways a forward-looking, progressive city. Before it elected Mr. Turner, it elected a mayor who was a lesbian. The city is in thrall to cars and highways and has precious little mass transit, but the municipality of Houston relies more on renewable energy than any other big city in America. Houston has more green space, relative to paved, than New York.Thomas Cole, director of the McGovern Center for Humanities and Ethics at the Texas Medical School of Houston, recalled how, during the 1960s, business leaders and politicians conspired with media executives to desegregate Houston quietly, seeing the turmoil that desegregation was causing elsewhere in the South. Decades later, Houston boasts of becoming the most diverse big city in the country, with comparatively low housing costs that translate to higher levels of minority homeownership.But what does \u201caffordable\u201d really mean if residents have to pay hefty transportation costs and rebuild, time and again, after floods? Houston\u2019s affordability leans on loosely regulated, low-cost immigrant labor providing an abundance of cheaply made, slab-on-grade, single-family houses that sprawl on all that open land, in areas like the Katy Prairie.Harris County officials say they have received as many requests for buyouts since the hurricane (3,000) as there have been buyouts since the mid-1990s. Harvey turned out to be an equal opportunity disaster. In Meyerland, an affluent district where Brays Bayou burst its banks, Steve and Julie Sacks\u2019s house flooded for the third time in three years. They are among the homeowners hoping for a buyout.\u201cBut I\u2019m not counting on one,\u201d Mr. Sacks told me. Buying out rich homes to repurpose vulnerable areas like Meyerland for flood detention, as Mr. Sacks notes, would require loads of money and remove valuable properties from tax rolls in a county that relies on property taxes.Bruce Hooper would move, too. During Harvey, he woke up to crackling sounds, when floodwaters started to seep into his appliances and electrical outlets. Mr. Hooper lives in a poor area called Kashmere Gardens. I found him sitting on a tattered lawn chair outside the shell of his tumbledown rental. An unemployed former parks employee, Mr. Hooper told me that he and his family of five had to be airlifted out by the Coast Guard after a detention pond overflowed and water inside the house rose from ankle to chest high in an hour. He would live elsewhere, he said, but like many others without flood insurance or savings, \u201cwe got nowhere else to go.\u201dAs for Andy and Christine Kahan, they were among thousands who had no inkling they were especially vulnerable before Harvey. The Kahans own a single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood, Bear Creek Village.\u201cThe damn dam did us in,\u201d Mr. Kahan said. The Kahans\u2019s home was among those houses flooded by the reservoirs, which Harvey for the first time filled and threatened to overflow.Christine Kahan and her husband had lived for 28 years in their house without a flood. Now Ms. Kahan said she would entertain a buyout. A part-time real-estate agent, she advises clients to think twice about buying any home that flooded. Hers is now one of them.But Mr. Kahan says they will stay, for the time being. \u201cI\u2019m not a skeptic about climate change,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt defies logic not to believe something is going on.\u201dI asked how that lined up with his desire not to leave Bear Creek. \u201cHarvey was an exception, an act of God,\u201d he said, then added, \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t make sense. But I\u2019m an optimist.\u201cAt least, I am until the next flood.\u201dWill Houston be any more ready by then?One afternoon I biked with Guy Hagstette around Buffalo Bayou Park. Mr. Hagstette is director of parks and civic projects for the Kinder Foundation, which underwrote much of the $75 million downtown park. We met at Allen\u2019s Landing, where the Buffalo and White Oak Bayous converge before flowing into the Houston Ship Channel. The Allen brothers were real estate swindlers from New York who founded Houston in 1836. After oil turned up beneath the muck and clay, they seemed like prophets.Harvey burst the tall banks of Buffalo Bayou Park, flooding the city\u2019s theater district and City Hall. It collapsed riverbanks and left dunes of silt that buried pedestrian paths, playgrounds and fields.\u201cThis will take a lot more than tweaking,\u201d Mr. Hagstette told me. He meant not just repairing and fortifying the park, but also adapting Houston to the new normal.For starters, that will require fresh numbers. Harris County demands that new developments retain enough rainwater on site to neutralize the effects of a 100-year storm. But those 100-year numbers date back years. They are based on mitigating a storm that averages 13.2 inches of rain in 24 hours. Harvey brought 25.9 inches in 24 hours. The Memorial Day flood dropped 11 inches in three hours. The Tax Day flood dumped 17 inches in 12 hours in the Katy Prairie.\u201cWe need to get climatologists, politicians and policymakers talking to each other,\u201d Jeff Lindner told me. \u201cThey\u2019re not.\u201d As meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District, Mr. Lindner spent five sleepless days and nights during Harvey as an unshakable, tousled expert in a blue, button-down shirt, going on television and providing Houstonians with useful information. We met at the flood control district office one morning.\u201cThere\u2019s little question the earth is warming,\u201d he said, adding as a qualifier: \u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s a natural cycle or human-induced, hotter air holds more moisture. And so for Harris County that means the potential for more extreme events.\u201dMr. Lindner\u2019s concern, he said, is that \u201cby the time policy is in place it will already lag behind the latest information.\u201dMr. Blackburn tells a story about a local hero, Jesse Jones, the former secretary of commerce, who helped secure federal funds for the ship channel. In 1929, Mr. Jones convinced fellow Houston bankers to put aside reserves of cash that prevented city banks from failing in the Depression. What may save Houston today, Mr. Blackburn said, is another common-sense strategy involving stricter controls and infrastructural investments that somehow lets state Republicans acquiesce behind closed doors but beat their chests in public.\u201cThe worst flood has not yet occurred,\u201d Mr. Blackburn noted. A hurricane that pushes a massive storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay, up the ship channel, could overwhelm refineries and unleash a toxic tsunami, killing many and rattling the national economy.The judge and mayor are among those talking about a so-called Ike Dike, named after Hurricane Ike in 2008, which killed dozens in Texas. It would be a massive sea-gate that could block a surge. The scale and engineering would be Texas-size.

{"Headline": "U.S. Airstrikes in Afghanistan Take Aim at Taliban Opium Labs", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 American and Afghan warplanes conducted a series of strikes on Sunday night at what American officials said were Taliban drug depots, as part of what is expected to be a sustained campaign targeting the group\u2019s $200 million-a-year opium trade.Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the commander of the United States operations in Afghanistan, said that B-52 bombers and F-22 warplanes took part in the strikes, the first such attacks under new authorities granted by President Trump to officials conducting the war in Afghanistan.\u201cHeroin\u2019s become a global issue,\u201d General Nicholson told reporters on Monday during a teleconference news briefing from Afghanistan. \u201cThese criminals living in Afghanistan who are closely linked to the Taliban are responsible for 85 percent of the world\u2019s opium.\u201dHe said that the campaign against Taliban drug labs, which he said numbered about 400 to 500 across the country, would continue into the foreseeable future. The United States alone spends more than $8 billion to fight the drug trade.Regional experts suggest that the campaign is necessary, as the drug trade, estimated to make up at least 60 percent of the Taliban\u2019s income, has helped sustain the war. The Taliban have recently turned to refining heroin from the country\u2019s vast poppy production, which greatly increases their profits.For years, most of the harvest was smuggled out in the form of bulky opium syrup that was refined in other countries. But officials say that now, at least half of Afghan opium is processed in the country.General Nicholson characterized the Taliban as a criminal drug organization masquerading as religious and political leaders.\u201cThey fight so that they can keep profiting from narcotics trade and other criminal activities,\u201d he said during a separate news conference on Monday in Kabul with the Afghan Army chief of staff. There are 13 major drug trafficking organizations in Afghanistan, General Nicholson said, seven of which are in Helmand Province, a stronghold for the militants.The Taliban used to prohibit poppy cultivation when they governed the country in the 1990s. But since they were toppled in 2001, and later became an insurgent group, mounting a war against the Afghanistan government and its American sponsors, the Taliban have increasingly come to depend on the opium trade for funds.In Afghanistan, the opium economy almost doubled in 2016, to about $3 billion, and amounted to around 16 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The increase in processing means that the Taliban have been able to take a greater share of the $60 billion that the global trade in the Afghan opium crop is estimated to be worth.Mr. Trump had put little emphasis on the opium trade in his new strategy toward Afghanistan, announced in August. But General Nicholson said on Monday that the American military would support its Afghan partners in a sustained effort against the labs that have proliferated.Still, the airstrikes on Sunday hit only 10 of the labs, General Nicholson said, signaling what could become a prolonged campaign.\u201cThe new authorities\u201d granted by Mr. Trump in August \u201callow me to go after revenue streams of the enemy,\u201d General Nicholson said.\u201cThese strikes required mapping\u201d of the Taliban\u2019s drug depots and revenue infrastructure, he said, \u201cin ways that we have not done before.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Announces Jerome Powell as New Fed Chairman", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cHe\u2019s strong, he\u2019s committed, he\u2019s smart,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the White House Rose Garden, where he introduced Mr. Powell as his choice. Using Mr. Powell\u2019s nickname, the president said, \u201cI am confident that with Jay as a wise steward of the Federal Reserve, it will have the leadership it needs in the years to come.\u201dBut he lacks the deep background in economics of some of his predecessors, and he has expressed skepticism in the past about the unconventional measures that the Fed took after the recession.Mr. Powell could also depart from the Fed\u2019s current trajectory when it comes to regulating banks and other financial institutions \u2014 rules Mr. Trump has said should be loosened.The nominee offered little hint of his thinking during brief remarks in the Rose Garden. He said the nation\u2019s economy has made \u201csubstantial progress toward full recovery\u201d since the financial crisis and that banks are in far better shape. \u201cI will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant and prepared to respond to changes in markets and evolving risks,\u201d he said.By most conventional measures, Ms. Yellen\u2019s four years as the nation\u2019s top monetary policymaker have been a success.Mr. Powell is a Republican with strong roots in the party\u2019s establishment and in the financial industry, a lawyer by training and investment banker by trade. As Fed chair, a position some consider the second most powerful post in government, he would be the voice of an institution that is charged with keeping the economy on track by adjusting interest rates that influence the decisions of millions of Americans.Mr. Trump said that he respected Ms. Yellen and on Thursday called her \u201ca wonderful woman who has done a terrific job.\u201d In a statement, Ms. Yellen congratulated her chosen successor and said she was \u201cconfident in his deep commitment to carrying out the vital public mission of the Federal Reserve.\u201dThe Fed under Ms. Yellen\u2019s leadership has sharply reduced unemployment while maintaining control of inflation, coming as close to achieving its congressional mandate as at any time in its history.Her prospects to be renominated momentarily lifted making when the president agreed to meet with her on Oct. 19 at the urging of Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s national economics adviser who himself was once a top candidate.Mr. Trump came away genuinely impressed with Ms. Yellen, according to a person briefed on the process, but a speech she gave in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in favor of financial regulation damaged her chances given the White House agenda of cutting red tape and freeing up financial firms.White House officials said Mr. Trump was impressed with Mr. Powell\u2019s combination of government and private sector experience. Ultimately, Mr. Trump, who as a real estate developer benefited from cheap credit, came down for Mr. Powell, whom he hopes will deliver lower interest rates.The position requires Senate confirmation, but Mr. Powell is likely to attract broad support from the Republican majority. He won some Democratic votes when he was confirmed as a Fed governor in 2012, and when he was confirmed again in 2014.The Federal Reserve has embarked on a path of gradually raising its interest rate from ultralow levels meant to stimulate the economy after the financial crisis. The Fed is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate again in December, likely Ms. Yellen\u2019s final act as chair. Under Mr. Powell\u2019s leadership, the Fed will presumably continue on its projected path of raising its interest rate three more times next year, as well as continuing to pare back its massive balance sheet of Treasury notes and bonds.Mr. Powell remains a centrist voice in the Fed\u2019s internal debates, arguing for the Fed to end its stimulus campaign at a slow and steady pace. Over the last year, that has placed him solidly among the majority led by Ms. Yellen.\u201cOur view is Powell is the G.O.P. version of Yellen, with the added kicker of wanting to reduce regulation,\u201d said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets.But some argue that there is more uncertainty surrounding Mr. Powell\u2019s approach than for other recent Fed chairs. Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities, said it was unclear how aggressive Mr. Powell would be in responding to an economic slowdown.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to think of Powell as a Yellen clone,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cIn terms of the core issues of monetary policy, we just don\u2019t have much of a baseline for him.\u201dMr. Powell would be the first Fed chair in four decades who does not have a degree in economics \u2014 meaning his opinions may not be as fully formed as some of his predecessors. He also lacks a body of academic work analysts could parse for his views.Ms. Yellen\u2019s work on the labor market and former Fed chair Ben Bernanke\u2019s focus on financial crises both gave insight into their leadership at the Fed, said Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University. But beyond Mr. Powell\u2019s performance as a \u201cloyal lieutenant\u201d to Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen, \u201cwe don\u2019t know all that much about any existing priors Powell has about monetary policy,\u201d she said.As a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, Mr. Powell raised concerns in 2013 that the Fed was trying too hard to revive economic growth with its massive bond-buying program \u2014 calling into question whether he would be as willing as Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen to use such tools again.The Fed announced in September 2012 that it would launch a third round of bond buying, purchasing $85 billion a month in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until economic conditions improved to its satisfaction. The program was backed by Mr. Bernanke, then Fed chair, and Ms. Yellen, then the vice chairwoman, who argued the Fed had not done enough to reduce unemployment.A group of three Fed governors, including Mr. Powell, pressed Mr. Bernanke to clarify the Fed\u2019s goals, establishing what Mr. Powell called an \u201coff-ramp\u201d for the program.\u201cThere are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThere are some ideas that I would not support.\u201dMr. Powell has expressed support for legislation that would require financial regulators to apply cost-benefit analysis to proposed rules. He pushed back against proposals to allow large banks to borrow more of their funding, saying that requiring them to raise capital from investors had strengthened the financial system.Mr. Powell, 64, is a Washington native. He studied politics at Princeton, then earned a law degree from Georgetown and embarked on a career in investment banking.In 1990, he returned to Washington to work for Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and was named under secretary for finance. When Salomon Brothers was caught trying to manipulate the market in Treasuries, Mr. Powell spent an August weekend making phone calls from Cape Cod, arranging for the company\u2019s top managers to resign and for Warren Buffett, a major investor, to become chairman of the company\u2019s board.Mr. Powell joined the private equity firm Carlyle Group in 1997. Over the next eight years, he solidified his fortune. His 2016 financial disclosure form showed a net worth of as much as $55 million. In 2005, he left the firm to focus on public policy as a scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center.He attracted the attention of the Obama administration in 2011, when he worked behind the scenes to persuade congressional Republicans to raise the debt ceiling. The next year, President Barack Obama nominated Mr. Powell to the Fed.Kate Kelly and Ben Casselman contributed reporting from New York, and Peter Baker from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tax Overhaul Bears Gifts for Conservatives, Including Rights for \u2018Unborn\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump has long sought to appeal to religious and social conservatives, many of whom were initially wary of the candidacy of a thrice-married Manhattan billionaire who had openly boasted of his sexual conquests and displayed little interest in church or the Christian faith.The tax bill seems to deliver on that front. Among the biggest wins for social conservatives is the inclusion of the words \u201cunborn child\u201d in the legislation.The language is contained in an innocuous provision related to education savings vehicles \u2014 so-called 529 plans, which are state-sponsored, tax-free investment funds that allow families to put aside money for a child\u2019s college education. The provision explicitly allows expectant parents to designate a \u201cchild in utero\u201d as a beneficiary of a 529 plan.Parents have long been able to set up 529 accounts for an unborn child, but the provision accomplishes what anti-abortion activists have long sought: It enshrines into federal law the recognition of the unborn.\u201cAn unborn child means a child in utero,\u201d the provision states. \u201cA child in utero means a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.\u201dMarjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion rights, said the addition of the words \u201cunborn child\u201d was a major victory for their movement.Eliminating it was an early campaign promise of Mr. Trump\u2019s, and it has been a cause long championed by religious conservatives.\u201cRepealing the bigoted Johnson Amendment is long overdue,\u201d Ralph Reed, the head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a letter on Thursday to members of Congress.\u201cThis clearly unconstitutional restriction on freedom of speech has been used by the Internal Revenue Service to harass, intimidate and persecute the faith community for over six decades,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is long past time to repeal it and we strongly support this legislation\u2019s provision restoring the full First Amendment rights of people of faith.\u201dStill, doing away with the Johnson Amendment is not a cause that unites all conservatives, nor is it one that liberals are likely to let go quietly because of the considerable clout it would give pastors in the electoral process.\u201cThe entire reason Donald Trump promised religious leaders he would help get rid of the Johnson Amendment was to empower the Christian right,\u201d said Peter Montgomery, a senior fellow for People for the American Way, a left-leaning political advocacy group.Other aspects of the bill would make it harder for immigrant parents to claim the refundable child tax credit, even if their children were born in the United States. Under the legislation, filers would need to provide a Social Security number, rather than just a taxpayer identification number, in order to claim the benefit, which can be claimed even by those who owe no taxes. Social Security numbers are provided only to United States citizens or those authorized to work in the country.The left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities said the provision would roll back eligibility for about three million children in working families, including about 80 percent born in the United States.Some portions of the bill did not sit well with social conservatives, including the proposed repeal of the adoption tax credit and the inability to claim the child tax credit for a fetus.\u201cWe are adamantly opposed to the elimination of the adoption tax credit,\u201d Ms. Dannenfelser said. \u201cAnd in order to help poor, expectant mothers and families, we are pressing for the expansion of the child tax credit to include the unborn child.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It Started as a Tax Cut. Now It Could Change American Life.", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisSome of this re-engineering is straight out of the traditional Republican playbook. Corporate taxes, along with those on wealthy Americans, would be slashed on the presumption that when people in penthouses get relief, the benefits flow down to basement tenements.All of this is taking shape at such extraordinary velocity, absent the usual analyses and hearings, that even the most savvy Washington lobbyist cannot be fully certain of the implications.Mr. Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress \u2014 stymied in their efforts to repeal Obamacare, and short of legislative achievements \u2014 have signaled absolute resolve to get a tax bill passed by the end of the year. As the sense has taken hold that Washington is now a trading floor where any deal is worth entertaining so long as it brings votes, interest groups have fixed on the tax bill as a unique opportunity to further their agendas.\u201cPeople want to add certain things, and if they don\u2019t cost a lot, it\u2019s a way to buy in agreement,\u201d Mr. Steuerle said.It\u2019s virtually impossible to fully understand, let alone keep up with, the flood of proposals, amendments and analyses that continue to pour out. Here are some of the big-picture ideas to keep in mind as this political sausage is being made.\u201cWhen you put all these pieces together, what you\u2019re left with is we are squandering a giant sum of money,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a former chief of staff at the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation who teaches law at the University of Southern California. \u201cIt\u2019s not aimed at growth. It is not aimed at the middle class. It is at every turn carefully engineered to deliver a kiss to the donor class.\u201dIf the package does have a guiding philosophy, it is a return to trickle-down economics, an enduring story line in which the wealthy are supposed to spend and invest their tax breaks, creating jobs and commercial opportunities for everyone else.As President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes in the 1980s, he argued that citizens, not bureaucrats, should decide how to spend their money. President George W. Bush bestowed enormous tax cuts on the affluent.Nonetheless, Republicans are staging a trickle-down revival.\u201cEither it\u2019s a religious belief, a belief where no amount of evidence would change that, or they are using the argument cynically and they just want more money for themselves,\u201d the economist Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate, said.Mr. Stiglitz has long warned of the perils of growing inequality while deriding tax-cutting inclinations. Yet even those who have favored lighter tax burdens are critical of the current proposals.In the late 1970s, Bruce Bartlett developed what would become the locus of the Reagan tax cuts while working for Representative Jack Kemp, a conservative Republican from New York. Those cuts helped cushion the pain from sharp increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bartlett maintains. But Reagan was lowering the highest tax rate on individuals from 70 percent down to 28 percent by 1986.\u201cWhat they have here is a big tax cut for the rich paid for with random increases in taxes for various constituencies,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. And it\u2019s telling that they are ramming this through without any debate. All of the empirical evidence goes against the tax cut.\u201dThe meat of the package is a permanent lowering of the corporate tax rate, to 20 percent from 35 percent, which business leaders have long wanted. Proponents assert that this would prompt multinational companies to expand operations in the United States.\u201cWe\u2019ve been bleeding corporate headquarters and production for a long time,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit that promotes smaller government.In 2004, Congress invited American corporations to bring home overseas earnings at a sharply reduced rate, pitching it as a means of bolstering investment. But the corporations spent as much as 90 percent of their windfall buying back their shares, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis research.If Congress bestows fresh relief on major businesses, signs suggest a similar result. Many companies are enjoying record profits. Those in the Fortune 500 had $2.6 trillion salted away overseas as of last year.\u201cIn our boardroom, the number-one thing we\u2019re talking about is not taxes,\u201d said Jeremy Stoppelman, chief executive of Yelp, the online review platform. \u201cHaving a strong middle class out there spending money is what\u2019s most important for our business.\u201dIf the tax bill widens inequality, local communities will likely find themselves with fewer resources to aim at helping struggling people.In high-tax states like California, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut \u2014 where electorates have historically shown a willingness to finance ample safety-net programs \u2014 the measure could change the political calculus. It would magnify the costs to taxpayers, pressuring states to stay lean or risk the wrath of voters.Some see in this tilt a reworking of basic principles that have prevailed in American life for generations.The Senate tax bill has been marketed by Republicans as a tax cut for the middle class. How would people in your income group fare?Since the 1930s, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt created Social Security, unemployment benefits and other pillars of the safety net to combat the Great Depression, crises have been tempered by some measure of government support. Recent decades have brought cuts to social services, but the impact of the current bill could be especially consequential.\u201cThis tax bill is a grand deception,\u201d said Arnold Hiatt, the former chief executive of Stride Rite, which makes children\u2019s shoes. \u201cIt hurts the most vulnerable, and hurts health care and education, which are essential for a healthy economy.\u201dThe proposals break from seven decades\u2019 worth of federal efforts to broaden access to higher education.The House bill includes provisions that would end the deductibility of tuition waivers for graduate students and repeal the deduction for interest paid on student loans. Both chambers\u2019 bills would tax investment earnings from university endowments.The endowment tax, in particular, threatens the ability of low-income students to pursue college and graduate studies, said Ron Haskins, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Proceeds from endowments subsidize students from lower-income families, while allowing students across the board to graduate with less debt.\u201cIt\u2019s very far-reaching,\u201d he added, \u201cbut there hasn\u2019t been much of a debate.\u201dDavid Gelles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why German Markets Aren\u2019t Worried About Angela Merkel. Yet.", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Europe over the past decade has endured government bond meltdowns, bank failures, right-wing populists and Brexit.So when talks to form a new German government broke down last week, raising questions about Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s political future, the Continent\u2019s business elite refused to panic.\u201cThe world has so many crises. Germany is not in crisis mode at the moment,\u201d said Roland Berger, founder of the management consultancy based in Munich that bears his name.At least for now, the thriving European economy seems capable of absorbing anything that squabbling politicians might throw at it. The political deadlock in Berlin, though alarming by German standards, has not been enough to shake investors\u2019 faith that the Germans will work it out somehow.Yet there is also an uneasy feeling that the calm could be deceptive. While Germany does not have any serious economic problems that require wrenching policy changes, it faces rising longer-term challenges like an aging work force, the emergence of China as an industrial competitor and the need to invest in digital networks and a better power grid to stay relevant.And Germany\u2019s voice in important European matters that lie ahead could be diminished if Ms. Merkel oversees a weak, divided governing coalition.\u201cThere are no pressing issues for the German government to address,\u201d said Christian Kopf, head of fixed income at Union Investment, a fund manager in Frankfurt. \u201cBut we do need a capable government to deal with the severe challenges we face at the European level in the next two years.\u201dMs. Merkel, Germany\u2019s leader for more than a decade, emerged as a major global figure in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. At home, she oversaw a plunge in joblessness and an economic expansion that contrasted with misery in much of the rest of Europe.Her tenure is far from over. This week Germany\u2019s Social Democrats were reconsidering their decision not to continue a coalition government with Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats. Five years of compromising with Ms. Merkel has hurt the Social Democrats among their blue-collar base. But the alliance of the two mainstream parties provided the kind of stability that business craves.But during her 12 years in office, Ms. Merkel has largely been coasting on reforms to the labor market and social welfare system undertaken by her Social Democratic predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, at great cost to his political career.To defend its long-term competitiveness, analysts say, Germany needs to be investing in infrastructure and its work force. With an unemployment rate of only 3.6 percent, the country will face labor shortages unless it can integrate immigrants into the work force. That will require more investment in education and training.The twin pillars of German industry, precision machinery and automobiles, face unprecedented levels of technological change and new competition from places like China and Silicon Valley. European governments need to respond by, for example, building charging networks to encourage an electric car industry.\u201cThere is a deep structural adjustment process underway that requires assistance from the government,\u201d said Ralph Wiechers, chief economist of VDMA, an organization that represents German engineering companies. \u201cWhat are we producing in the future for what markets? What skills do we need to be competitive?\u201dMs. Merkel has cordial if sometimes tense relations with German chief executives. She has led delegations of German business leaders to Beijing and other foreign destinations to promote their exports, and she beat back proposals that would have increased taxes.\u201cShe hasn\u2019t done anything against business, on the other side she hasn\u2019t done a lot for business,\u201d Mr. Wiechers said. \u201cThere are no big programs where you can say, \u2018She did this for the economy.\u2019\u201dOn balance, Europe\u2019s management class would probably be sorry to see Ms. Merkel go. Europe\u2019s economy recovery is still young, and followed almost a decade of financial crisis and recession that nearly destroyed the eurozone. Right-wing populism has been contained in Western Europe but remains a threat.Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the chairman of the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, credited Ms. Merkel with neutralizing reactionary elements in Germany and restraining those in her party who would have gladly let the eurozone collapse rather than support it with German tax revenue.Despite the mixed feelings that business leaders have about the chancellor, her departure amid political disorder could shake their confidence. There are no potential successors with anywhere near her track record or international stature.\u201cIt depends on how long the uncertainty lasts,\u201d Mr. Bini Smaghi said. \u201cIn the European business world, the role she played in the crisis to push Germany forward rather than backward is very much appreciated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

($125,000 plus a 24-year-and-up lease on the land with the mortgage guaranteed by Harry\u2019s then-employer Mort Zuckerman). It\u2019s the kind of specific reporting that made Tina\u2019s Vanity Fair so juicy.Going out on the high-life circuit was work, part of the job. Tina cultivated sources, picked up story ideas. It was exhausting but occasionally profound. At a charity benefit for suicide prevention, she hears William Styron speak about the night he tried to kill himself, and rushes to his table as soon as he sits back down to suggest he turn his speech into a piece for Vanity Fair. It runs at 20,000 words with a headline Tina pulls from Milton\u2019s \u201cParadise Lost\u201d: \u201cDarkness Visible.\u201dAt about the same time, Donald Trump, who has already made a number of banal appearances, pours a glass of wine down Marie Brenner\u2019s back at a charity event at Tavern on the Green in revenge for her Vanity Fair piece that reported he kept a book of Hitler\u2019s speeches in his bedroom. In her epilogue, Tina calls him \u201cthe ultimate personification of the gilded grossness of the 1980s,\u201d but with the bright side that his fake news and war on the press is reviving journalism. Yes and no. She remembers \u201cthe 1980s Valhalla of well-funded editorial confidence, when you could pursue excellence as well as profit.\u201d But now it is not agreed that magazines have anything but a past.\u201cThe Vanity Fair Diaries\u201d is corroborating evidence. Journalists will feast on it, but so too will anyone interested in media \u2014 especially magazines and how they came and went. If you liked Tina Brown\u2019s Vanity Fair in the \u201980s, her diary pages will sweep you back and even if you could get a little fed up with Tina back then, you will miss her now.Terry McDonell is the author of \u201cThe Accidental Life: An Editor\u2019s Notes on Writing and Writers.\u201d He was the top editor at numerous magazines including Sports Illustrated and Esquire, and is co-founder of LitHub.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angolan Leader Ousts Predecessor\u2019s Daughter as Oil Chief", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter making a campaign promise to root out nepotism, Angola\u2019s new leader turned his sights Wednesday on the oil industry, ousting his predecessor\u2019s daughter as head of the nation\u2019s largest company.The move by President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o shakes up the country\u2019s political calculus and its oil-based economy, which has been plagued by corruption.The state oil company, Sonangol, has long been viewed as a vehicle for promoting the interests of former President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, who ruled the country for 38 years. And the company\u2019s stewardship by his daughter Isabel was a daily reminder that he was still influential as head of the ruling party.But Mr. Louren\u00e7o vowed during his campaign to distance himself from President dos Santos, and he did so on Wednesday with a flourish, dismissing not only Ms. dos Santos but the company\u2019s board as well.There was no sign that traders thought the change in leadership would reduce Angola\u2019s oil output, the second highest in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria\u2019s. Oil prices drifted lower on Wednesday after rising last week in large part because of concerns about potential instability in Saudi Arabia.A group of 12 influential lawyers led by David Mendes, an independent member of the National Assembly, had sought to remove her from her position, claiming she was put in place to bury evidence of her father\u2019s embezzlement at the company before he left office in September.Mr. Mendes applauded the change and called on the government to investigate Ms. dos Santos\u2019s management of the company.President Louren\u00e7o had already dismissed the heads of several other state companies, including the three state-owned media companies.\u201cIt\u2019s probably early to tell if this is the introduction of transparency to Angola or just a changing of the guard,\u201d said David Goldwyn, who was the State Department\u2019s top energy diplomat in the first Obama administration. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if this is just dos Santos\u2019s cabal having had its share of the trough and now it\u2019s time for the new guard to have their turn.\u201dSonangol is not only the dominant player in Angola\u2019s oil industry, but also a provider of telecommunications services, radio transmission and air transportation. It is also one of the most ambitious African oil companies, with ventures in Brazil, Cuba and Venezuela.Sonangol is a partner with some of the biggest international oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and BP.Angola, which is a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces more than 1.5 percent of the global oil supply.The government put out a short statement about Ms. dos Santos\u2019s dismissal but gave no explanation.Ms. dos Santos gave no public statement, and neither did her father. Her younger brother, Jos\u00e9 Filomeno, continues to head the country\u2019s $5 billion sovereign wealth fund.President Louren\u00e7o appointed Carlos Saturnino, a former Sonangol official who is an ally of the president, as Ms. dos Santos\u2019s replacement. He is to lead a review of company operations.\u201cSince the national oil company is the prime source of national wealth and political power, you have to consolidate your control by putting your own people in key positions,\u201d said Donald Hertzmark, an energy consultant who has worked in Angola. \u201cThat controls the flow of wealth and resources.\u201dGilberto Neto contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Blue Apron\u2019s Co-Founder Steps Down as C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here are some stories we are watching:\u2022 The Bitcoin rocket has wobbled. Is a crash coming?\u2022 T. Boone Pickens begins to step back from public life.Shares of Blue Apron have struggled since it went public in June. The company priced its initial public offering at $10, 40 percent below its target. Since then, the stock has tumbled 70 percent to $2.99.Blue Apron has faced increased competition from Amazon and rival meal-kit delivery start-ups. Amazon\u2019s announcement on June 16 that it would purchase Whole Foods Market weighed heavily on the offering. Since then, the company has done little to assuage investors. It has reported losing customers for two straight quarters and has laid off hundreds of employees.The Dow Jones Industrial Average smashed through 24,000 on Thursday. Increased optimism that the Senate will pass the Republican tax bill pushed the index up more than 300 points to close at 24,273 today.The rally extends a record run for the blue-chip index this year. The Dow has gained 21 percent this year.Here is a quick look at the run:\u2022The Dow has crossed five millennial markers this year, the most on record.\u2022 It took the Dow just 30 days to go from 23000 to 24000, the third fastest 1,000 point move in history.\u2022 The Dow has had 63 record closes this year.\u2022 the index is up 271 percent since March 9, 2009, the bear market low.A stated goal of the Republican tax overhaul was to prevent corporations from shifting profits to low-tax countries.Several academic economists, legal scholars and the Coalition for a Prosperous America argued Wednesday that the Republican plan speeding its way through Congress does not sufficiently address this issue.Daniel Alpert, founder of Westwood Capital and an adviser to the Coalition for a Prosperous America, writes that United States companies \u201cwill continue to face competition\u201d from multinational corporations \u201cthat will continue to divert their taxable income to tax haven jurisdictions around the world.\u201d\u201cThe GOP congressional leadership and the White House could and should have embarked on real corporate tax reform, that is in the national interest and broadens the tax base while trimming marginal rates.\u201dIn a letter to Congress, the group advocated for the adoption of sales factor apportionment:\u201cRedefining the source of income is, in our view, the key to correcting the current dysfunction. This is what the sales factor apportionment system, already in use by most US states, does. Corporations earn income from sales. Therefore income should be allocated based upon the destination of those sales. MNC income should no longer be allocated based upon the location of a subsidiary that allegedly earned it. The location of sales is much more difficult to manipulate than the \u201corigin of income\u201d under the current system.\u201cThe US tax base for corporations would be calculated on the basis of a fraction of companies\u2019 worldwide income. This fraction would be the share of each company\u2019s worldwide sales that are destined for customers in the United States. The taxpayer, under SFA, is the whole unitary business, including all evasion-motivated subsidiaries over which the parent corporations exercise legal and economic control.\u201d\u201cIn effect, firms should be taxed on their access to a specific consumer market - from which they generate revenue - rather than on their cleverness at artificially allocating expenses and revenue in tax havens in which their subsidiaries \u2018incorporate.\u2019\u201d\u201cI think Aspen\u2019s work is needed more than ever. We have to have a table that people can gather around, to share perspectives and ideas and to translate those ideas into action. It really matters that we commit ourselves to evidence-based argumentation, to respecting what has been established through science, building upon past knowledge. Part of what\u2019s made this country great is a commitment to being reality based and to being factually grounded. Public policy has grown out of so much serious research.\u201dThe Royal Bank of Scotland told staff on Thursday that it was formally closing its internal bad bank, an important milestone as Chief Executive Ross McEwan works to turn around the British bank.Since the division was started in 2008, the bank, based in Edinburgh, has exited 22 countries, cut its risk-weighted assets by more than half and shrunk its assets to 752 billion, or about $1 trillion. The bank held as much as \u00a32.2 trillion in assets.Closing the Capital Resolution unit is an important moment, but the bank\u2019s turnaround is far from finished.R.B.S. has not reported an annual profit in nine years. It is not expected to report an annual profit until 2018 despite reporting a profit in the first half of this year.The bank passed a stress test by the Bank of England this year that measured the ability of lenders to weather another financial crisis, but remained among the weakest of the biggest British banks. (It was forced to bolster its capital last year after failing the regulatory test.)R.B.S. also remains 72 percent owned by the British government following a bailout during the financial crisis. The government said this month that it plans to resume sales of its holdings by 2019 and hopes to sell some \u00a315 billion of its stake by 2022.That process will be helped if R.B.S. can continue to improve its profitability and its capital position. A return to paying a dividend next year also would be a welcome sign for shareholders.From the WSJ:\u201cBelieve me, I didn\u2019t have this much fun with T. Rowe Price, \u201d said the retired secretary and taxi driver Ms. Scott, referring to her mutual-fund investments.Steven Mnuchin and other White House officials have argued that the Republican tax overhaul plans would pay for themselves through higher economic growth. And there were studies to prove that, even as critics say that tax cuts wouldn\u2019t have such an effect.An economist at the Office of Tax Analysis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize his job, said Treasury had not released a \u201cdynamic\u201d analysis showing that the tax plan would be paid for with economic growth because one did not exist.Instead, Treasury staffers have done smaller analyses of individual provisions.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedStarting with putting his 65,000-acre Mesa Vista Ranch in Texas up for sale, with a price tag of $250 million.Slowly but inevitably, my fading vision and limited hearing have forced me to give up things I\u2019ve loved and excelled at \u2014 golf and hunting, in particular. Although the beauty of Mesa Vista remains intact, the ranch roads I have driven thousands of times are now blurred. It\u2019s time to embrace and accept that my life has changed.It\u2019s acknowledgment by the 89-year-old Mr. Pickens that he is in his twilight years, after having built a fortune as an oil magnate and then a financier who rose to fame during the corporate raider period of the 1980s.In selling the Mesa Vista Ranch, the mogul said that he wants to make sure that it ends up with a buyer who will carry on his conservation efforts.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe firing of Matt Lauer from NBC News for \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace\u201d marks one of the highest-profile dismissals yet in business for misconduct and abuse. It also highlights the potential financial impact of those violations.Much of Mr. Lauer\u2019s power stemmed from the bond he had forged with viewers as the longest tenured host in the program\u2019s 65 years. The first two hours of \u201cToday\u201d \u2014 Mr. Lauer\u2019s showcase \u2014 generated $508 million in revenue last year, more than the amount brought in by the other network morning shows, according to Kantar Media.And while \u201cToday\u201d trails ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in total viewers, it still leads in the coveted 25-to-54 advertising demographic.The bigger pictureAt the end of the day, any company is better off \u2014 and I do mean financially better off \u2014 without someone who uses their power for inappropriate sexual behavior that makes the workplace a threatening place for colleagues and stymies women\u2019s ability to climb the ranks.A senior financial executive phoned Michael last night to complain about how the Senate tax plan would endanger the private equity industry because it limits the deductibility of corporate debt interest payments \u2014 and applies that even to existing investments. The provision could completely upend the private equity business model, this person asserted.Dell took on about $50 billion in debt for its merger with EMC Corp. At a roughly 5 percent interest rate, that means the company has about $2 billion in annual interest payments. The House and Senate bills would remove at least half those deductions, Mr. Vallone said in an interview Wednesday. At a 20 percent tax rate, that\u2019s a $200 million hit each year.The state of playThe Senate could vote as soon as tomorrow on its tax plan. But there are plenty of unresolved matters:While the 3.7 percent drop in an index tracking Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google was the biggest in 21 months, the amount of lost money exceeded any other single day on record. At about $60 billion, the decline in their combined market value is poised to eclipse any since Facebook arrived in public markets.What\u2019s behind the drop? It could be as simple as investors believing that the huge run-up in tech stocks this year has reached its natural end, and that changes to tax policy would provide a lift to other industries.The tech and media flyaroundSpeaking at the Economic Club of New York, Randall Stephenson of AT&T said that he had been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest defenders in the corporate world when it came to public policy. And then the Justice Department sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner.The company, which collects and analyzes data for industrial companies, got the money from a new investor, the British money manager Baillie Gifford, and the existing backers Revolution Growth and GreatPoint Ventures.\u201cI have never seen a case where there were so many bad things done like Uber has done in this case.\u201dAdvertisement"}
