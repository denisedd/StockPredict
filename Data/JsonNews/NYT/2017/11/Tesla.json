{"Headline": "Stocks Indexes Close Largely Unchanged After Tax Plan Is Unveiled", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks on Wall Street closed mainly unchanged on Thursday as the financial markets digested new details of an ambitious Republican plan to cut taxes.The tax plan would crunch the number of individual tax brackets to three from seven and slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Homeowners are now able to deduct mortgage interest on loans up to $1 million. Under the proposal announced on Thursday, that cap would drop to $500,000 for new mortgages.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which fell as much as 0.5 percent when the tax details were first released, ended the session unchanged, at 2,579.85. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.4 percent, at 23,516.26. The Nasdaq composite was flat, at 6,714.94.Under their tax plan, House Republicans also want to end a program that offers buyers of electric-powered vehicles a tax credit of up to $7,500. Shares of the electric-car maker Tesla, which tumbled in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company announced a larger loss than expected for the third quarter, fell further after details of the tax plan were released on Thursday. Tesla shares closed 6.8 percent lower.\u201cA lot of what\u2019s in this plan are bargaining positions; we have to see how the final bill morphs as time goes forward,\u201d Steven Blitz, chief United States economist with TS Lombard, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of horse trading to come, so an overreaction doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201dThe prospect of business-friendly tax cuts have helped pushed stocks up in recent weeks as the tax bill took shape amid delays and intense debate.

Hence, why Anheuser-Busch is replacing the head of its United States subsidiary.The management changes mark a new phase for the company\u2019s U.S. operations, said Carlos Brito, chief executive of the Belgium-based behemoth. The first phase, after InBev\u2019s 2008 takeover of Anheuser-Busch, was aimed at cutting costs and paying off debt. The second focused on expanding the portfolio with craft beers and growing higher-end brands such as Stella Artois and Michelob Ultra, Mr. Brito said.Shares in the conglomerate closed down about 7.2 percent Monday, to $19.02.\u201cPerhaps the most encouraging development to be found in Mr. Flannery\u2019s 57-page slide show on Monday is a plan to put just 12 directors up for a vote next year, including three new ones.

{"Headline": "The New York Times Takes a Trip to a Driverless Future", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEver since I started as an editor at The New York Times Magazine a little more than three years ago, one of my main guiding principles has been: Don\u2019t go too far out on a limb. That precept feels particularly important to me because many of the stories I oversee are about science and technology, two subjects where it can be easy for journalists to get too far ahead of the facts. A new study might suggest some scientific breakthrough is on the horizon, but The Times should never cover it in a way that seems to imply it\u2019s already here. In my previous job, at Wired magazine, my colleagues and I had one example of hyperactive prognostication that we used as a running joke: \u201ccommuting in dirigibles.\u201d That absurd mental image was a stand-in for all the other ridiculous sci-fi fantasies that, cool as they may look on a magazine cover, have basically no chance of arriving.In the Tech and Design issue, out this week, my colleagues and I have made an exception to my rule.Indeed, we\u2019ve gone so far out on a limb \u2014 veering into pure speculation \u2014 that the branch has surely broken. That\u2019s because the subject of our issue, self-driving cars, is a science-fictional technology that has taken tremendous strides over the past few years, with billions of dollars being invested every year by some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, toward becoming a reality. This looming transformation of the car, itself the most transformative invention in American history, is still quite a few years off, and it still very well might stall or reverse entirely. But if it does arrive, and human drivers go the way of the carriage horse, the implications of that shift would be profound. With that in mind, we thought a little speculation might be called for.This week\u2019s edition is one of 15 special issues that the magazine will put out this year. Some of these issues let us give broad attention to important subjects \u2014 education, say, or business \u2014 that we otherwise might not cover enough. But in many cases, we\u2019ve found it especially fun (for us and also, we hope, for readers) to use them to go deep on one story or theme, turning it around and seeing it from every angle.But the real limb-breaking happens in the two essay packages that consume much of the magazine. In twenty short provocations, we\u2019ve asked writers to imagine transformations the world could undergo if humans are no longer driving themselves around. The Times business reporter Nathaniel Popper thinks through the question of how car insurance would change. Gretchen Reynolds, our Well columnist, sketched out an autonomous-car workout. Other writers forecast the effects of autonomous cars on everything from drug dealing to sex to roadkill. Definitely don\u2019t miss the back page, where the illustrator Tomi Um has envisioned what a \u201cMuseum of Driving\u201d would be like, in a future where the idea of driving your own car seems as remote as piloting a horse and buggy would today.Will any of us see a driverless future? It\u2019s hard to say. Right now, the technology works only under very controlled conditions, and something as simple as snow can change the environment around cars in ways that researchers are only beginning to figure out how to account for. But the strides have been so great, and the investment in the technology so vast. Certainly you\u2019re more likely to commute some day in a self-driving car than you are in a dirigible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Anyone Good Enough for an H-1B Visa?", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSix months ago I won the lottery \u2014 the H-1B visa processing lottery for skilled foreign workers. I called my thrilled parents and celebrated with friends. I\u2019m from northeastern China and have an M.B.A. from Stanford, and was planning to stay in Silicon Valley to help start a company based on a promising new technology to improve the use of data. I was overjoyed because, historically, being selected in the lottery was a near guarantee that an applicant could remain in this country at least three more years.But at the end of July, I received the dreaded Request for Further Evidence from immigration authorities. I provided the extra information that United States Citizenship and Immigration Services asked for. In September, I got another request. I complied again. Finally, on Oct. 11, half a year after my celebration, I learned I had been denied a visa.After earning law degrees in China and at Oxford, after having worked in Hong Kong as a lawyer at a top international firm, after coming to United States three years ago for an M.B.A. and graduating and joining a start-up, I was given just 60 days to leave the country. I have 17 days left.Many of my fellow international students are in situations similar to mine. Some had job offers from companies like Google, Apple and PwC when they learned that their applications had been denied or did not even make it into the lottery. For those whose employers have only United States offices, losing the lottery meant losing jobs and going home, with no real way to use the skills they were on the verge of contributing to the American economy.My two requests for evidence asked me to prove my job was a \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d \u2014 that is, work that only someone with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher can do. My work involves artificial intelligence and big data, and my letters of support came from an authority in my industry and veteran start-up investor, and a Nobel Prize winner. But it wasn\u2019t enough to convince the government that my job requires advanced skills.It\u2019s true that I\u2019m brokenhearted about missing the chance to return to China to care for my mother (she insisted that I stay and pursue the visa that was her dream for me), but I\u2019m not looking for sympathy. As much as I hate to leave, I know I will be fine.Rather, I\u2019m frustrated, because I know I\u2019m part of a pattern: America is losing many very skilled workers because of its anti-immigrant sentiment, and while this is a disappointing blow to me and my classmates, it will also be a blow to the United States\u2019 competitiveness in the global economy. Tech giants such as Google and Tesla were founded by immigrants.I can\u2019t make sense of why an administration that claims to want this country to be strong would be so eager to get rid of us. We are losing our dreams, and America is losing the value we bring.As I make plans to go back to China, I find myself wondering: If I am not qualified to stay in the United States, then who is?Frida Yu is a lawyer and entrepreneur.Advertisement"}

Sam Ezersky here; I\u2019ll be subbing for Deb today and tomorrow to give her some well-deserved R&R.

Her recent noteworthy answers include DIGITAL DATA, FRIEND REQUEST, BITMOJIS, LATTE ART and GENDER-FLUID. Today\u2019s fill is no different: CITI BIKES, a creation of the last five years, lies at 1-Across. RSS FEED, TESLA CARS and GOOGLE PLAY give the puzzle a very modern feel, too.Terms like these, while certainly worth knowing, may admittedly be unfamiliar to some.

{"Headline": "Five Technologies That Will Rock Your World", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is reason for concern, but also for optimism. The new wave of artificial intelligence will reduce jobs, but will also improve your health and products like your smartphone. Here are five areas where tech companies, large and small, will change the way we live.Such technology will improve health care in places where doctors are scarce. But eventually, it will streamline care in the developed world as well. Google is already running tests inside two hospitals in India, and the start-up Infervision has deployed similar technology in hospitals across China.In the longer term, similar methods promise to rapidly accelerate drug discovery and so many other aspects of health care. \u201cEverything from the nature of the food that we grow and eat to the drugs that we give ourselves to how we monitor the impact of these things is all being transformed by A.I. in deeply profound ways,\u201d said Matt Ocko, a managing partner at DCVC, a San Francisco venture capital firm that has invested heavily in this area.Neural networks are not limited to image recognition. Far from it. These same techniques are rapidly improving coffee-table gadgets like the Amazon Echo, which can recognize spoken commands from across the room, and online services like Skype, which can instantly translate phone calls from one language to another. They may even eventually produce machines that can carry on a conversation.Recently, said Luke Zettlemoyer, a University of Washington professor, there has been a \u201chuge phase shift\u201d in the area of natural language understanding \u2014 technology that understands the natural way people talk and write. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are at the forefront of this movement, which promises to fundamentally change how we interact with phones, cars, and potentially any machine. Many companies are moving down the same path, including Replika, a San Francisco start-up.With help from machine learning, Replika offers a smartphone \u201cchatbot\u201d that acts as a kind of personal confidante, chatting with you in moments when no one else is around. But the hope is that these techniques will improve to where they serve you in so many other ways. What if Alexa was truly conversational, if you could have a back and forth dialogue? Right now, it is about basic questions and commands. Today, it \u201crecognizes\u201d words very very well. But truly \u201cunderstanding\u201d complex English sentences is beyond machines at this point. What if machines could carry on a dialogue like Hal in 2001?Using electroencephalography, or EEG \u2014 a longstanding means of measuring electrical brain activity from sensors placed on the head \u2014 the start-up Neurable is building a virtual reality game that can be played with the mind. EEG is limited for this kind of use, but other researchers, including at Facebook, aim to build a far more powerful systems using optical sensors. Facebook hopes that, in a few years, this technology will let people type with their minds five times faster than they can with a smartphone keyboard.These techniques will also face physical limits, and that may bar the way to Facebook\u2019s goal. But various start-ups, including Neuralink, founded by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, are going several steps further, hoping to read brain activity from chips implanted inside the skull. At first, they will limit this technology to people with disabilities. But ultimately, Mr. Musk and others hope to also implant chips in healthy people.\u201cIt is implausible that this technology would go straight into healthy people,\u201d said Ed Boyden, an M.I.T. neuroscientist who is also an adviser to Neuralink. \u201cBut there is a natural trajectory where, if a medical technology proves effective, it can move into normal individuals as well.\u201dWant more science fiction in your everyday reality? As entrepreneurs like Mr. Musk work to put a chip in your head, others are working to put cars in the skies.At first, Kitty Hawk will sell its vehicles to hobbyists. But the company hopes it can eventually convince the general public, and regulators, that flying cars make sense. That is no easy task. After all, these cars will require a new kind of air traffic control.Even more outlandish? It\u2019s the prospect of a quantum computer. Drawing on the seemingly magical properties of quantum physics, such a machine would be exponentially more powerful than computers of today. Think of it this way: A quantum computer could instantly crack the encryption that protects the world\u2019s most private data.The problem is that these machines are enormously difficult to build. but progress has accelerated. Google, IBM and Intel are investing heavily in this push, as are start-ups like Rigetti Computing.Researchers say they believe that quantum machines eventually could accelerate drug discovery, streamline financial markets, solve traffic problems and more.\u201cIt is a completely different paradigm for processing information,\u201d said Robert Schoelkopf, who helped invent the techniques that are driving so much of quantum computing research. \u201cSo we think that known applications are just the tip of the iceberg.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indian Automaker\u2019s Plant Is Latest Sign of Detroit Comeback", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUBURN HILLS, Mich. \u2014 It has been years since Detroit, birthplace of the American auto industry, was a steady producer of the manufacturing jobs that defined it as the Motor City. But its comeback is entering a new phase.The latest milestone came Monday, with the announcement of the area\u2019s first new vehicle assembly plant in 25 years. And the automaker making it happen is from, of all places, India.The company, the Mumbai-based Mahindra Group, said it would begin producing off-road recreational and work vehicles at the plant, in Auburn Hills, early next year. And it indicated that this might be just a first step in its ambitions for the American market.\u201cNone of us really know where this journey will take us,\u201d said Rick Haas, chief executive of Mahindra\u2019s North American auto group. \u201cBut we are here to expand Mahindra\u2019s auto business in the U.S.\u201dMoreover, the company\u2019s chairman, Anand G. Mahindra, is taking a cue from another automotive entrepreneur, Elon Musk. Citing the success of Mr. Musk\u2019s electric-car start-up, Tesla, he said the traditional barriers to automotive success had been obliterated.\u201cHow many people told Elon Musk, \u2018You don\u2019t have any hope of getting into the car business\u2019?\u201d he said.Mahindra is a major producer of cars and trucks in India and South Korea, but until now it was mainly known in the United States as the world\u2019s leading maker of tractors. Mr. Mahindra said Detroit was a focal point for growth for the company\u2019s American businesses, which also include manufacturing electric bikes and scooters.\u201cWe have a responsibility to contribute to the resurgence of Detroit,\u201d Mr. Mahindra said at the plant\u2019s opening ceremony. \u201cThat means jobs, and that means investment.\u201dWhile the planned production volume pales in comparison with the output of large, mainstream auto plants, the factory underscores that the Detroit area is again attracting automotive investment.The region is still a prime source of engineering talent and manufacturing know-how, as well as a technology incubator for electric cars and self-driving systems. Mahindra already has a design and engineering center in Troy, half an hour north of Detroit, that turns out prototypes of future vehicles.\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of development that Detroit has not been able to compete for in recent years,\u201d Mr. Duggan said at the plant\u2019s groundbreaking last year. \u201cBut we are starting to compete now.\u201dMahindra\u2019s footprint in the Detroit area is small so far, with $230 million invested in the plant, the technical center and two related operations that employ about 270 people combined. The Auburn Hills site where the company is building its factory, in Detroit\u2019s northern suburbs, had been empty for years after housing an engineering firm.The company expects to build about 5,000 off-road vehicles in the plant\u2019s first year, then add capacity to more than double the volume.Mahindra also assembles tractors at several American plants and employs about 3,000 workers over all across the United States, part of a worldwide work force of more than 200,000.If Mahindra aims to make the leap in the American market from tractors and off-road models to cars or sport-utility vehicles, it has several options.Still, analysts foresee a tough challenge for any new entries into the hypercompetitive American auto market. After two consecutive years of record sales, demand has slipped in 2017. Moreover, automakers like General Motors, Volkswagen and Toyota are broadening their product lineups with both conventional gasoline-powered models and new electrified vehicles.\u201cIt will be an uphill battle for Mahindra,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, a longtime analyst with the firm Autotrader. \u201cTesla has done a brilliant job building a new brand, but it\u2019s very expensive to do that.\u201dYet it is hardly surprising that Mahindra has chosen to put down roots in Detroit to help it achieve its ambitions of becoming a player in the American market.\u201cThis is where the expertise is for building vehicles,\u201d Ms. Krebs said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the talent here and the suppliers, and it is the center of excellence for so much of the industry\u2019s research and development activities.\u201dManufacturing employment in the Detroit area declined substantially during the recession, which crippled auto sales and forced G.M. and the former Chrysler to seek government bailouts and bankruptcy protection to survive. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing jobs declined nearly 40 percent in the metropolitan area from 2005 to 2009, and have yet to bounce back completely.But the revival of the overall market for new vehicles, as well as the return of the Detroit car companies to financial health, has spurred a steady comeback for auto jobs \u2014 particularly in the high-tech sector supporting advances in autonomous driving and electric vehicles.\u201cIt is great to be part of this comeback story,\u201d said Rajan Wadhera, president of Mahindra\u2019s global automotive business. \u201cWe have a long and profitable and mutually beneficial relationship ahead of us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk Reassures Investors Over Model 3 Delays", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA year ago, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, pledged to revolutionize auto manufacturing with a major expansion of the company\u2019s electric-car factory in Fremont, Calif.But after disrupting the automotive world with innovative technology, stunning designs and its commitment to an all-electric lineup, Tesla is hamstrung on the most basic part of the car business: getting new vehicles built on time.In a letter to shareholders, Mr. Musk said he expected Tesla to be producing 5,000 Model 3 cars a week by early next year.\u201cWhile we continue to make significant progress each week in fixing Model 3 bottlenecks, the nature of manufacturing challenges during a ramp such as this makes it difficult to predict exactly how long it will take,\u201d he said.The company attributed its slow pace so far to difficulties in producing battery packs at its Nevada plant, called the Gigafactory. It also said that welding processes and final assembly tasks in the Fremont factory were moving more slowly than other parts of the manufacturing system.\u201cWe are adding robots at the choke points and making the lines go really fast,\u201d Mr. Musk told analysts during a webcast on Wednesday. \u201cSpeed is the ultimate weapon.\u201dGetting to market with the Model 3, which will carry a base price of about $35,000, has been a humbling experience so far. Tesla built just 260 Model 3 sedans in its most recent quarter \u2014 considerably short of its target of 1,500.And the sluggish pace has coincided with a rash of job cuts and allegations of lax safety standards on the assembly line from its workers.While Wall Street analysts and media coverage have focused on the shortfall in Model 3 production, Mr. Musk concentrated Wednesday on the fact that Tesla expected to deliver record numbers of its higher-priced Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles in the last three months of the year.But the company also reported wider losses than expected for the quarter that ended Sept. 30. Revenue from auto sales increased 8 percent to $2.08 billion, compared with the same period a year ago, but the company lost $619.4 million, versus posting a profit of $21.9 million in the third quarter of 2016.Tesla shares were off nearly 5 percent in extended trading after the earnings report and the production update, falling below $306, more than 20 percent lower than their midyear peak.One analyst, Clement Thibault of Investing.com, said Wednesday that Tesla\u2019s vertically integrated manufacturing system \u2014 which includes building many of its own major components, like batteries and seats \u2014 is out of step with tried-and-true industry practices.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason traditional car companies have an established decentralized business model,\u201d Mr. Thibault said. \u201cTesla believes it can centralize the process, but lacks any real world evidence to back up its claim.\u201dSince it began production in late summer, Tesla has sold the new Model 3 only to its employees, rather than begin filling the hundreds of thousands of orders from buyers who have put down $1,000 deposits.While Mr. Musk has said the employee-only sales strategy was meant to reward Tesla\u2019s work force, analysts have surmised that it was also a way to discover and correct quality problems before the vehicle is made available to the public.The bottom line, however, is that Tesla has yet to prove that it can meet the huge demand it has created for the new Model 3, and that it is capable of joining the big leagues of auto manufacturing.Further delays will most likely benefit competitors such as General Motors and Nissan, which offer electric vehicles in the Model 3\u2019s price range. And new electrified models are in the works from automakers like Volkswagen, Daimler and Toyota.\u201cAt this point in the game, all eyes are on the Model 3,\u201d said Akshay Anand, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. \u201cTesla needs to ensure its production volume is achieved. But perhaps more importantly, Tesla needs to ensure the vehicle is being produced in a quality manner.\u201dTesla is experiencing a number of labor-related issues as it works to increase its annual production output to 500,000 vehicles a year from about 100,000.But some workers have said that they were dismissed because they supported a union organizing drive conducted with the help of the powerful United Automobile Workers, which represents hourly employees at the three big Detroit automakers.One worker, Daniel Grant, said he had supported the union effort because of unsafe conditions in the Tesla factory \u2014 and he believed he had been fired for it.\u201cManagement pushed us hard, and it created very real risks for us working on the line,\u201d Mr. Grant said in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wore a union T-shirt, and that\u2019s why I handed out fliers.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe I was fired for performance,\u201d said Mr. Grant, who said he had been injured on the job and fired a few days later.Workers have said that Tesla\u2019s production systems can cause injuries linked to repetitive stress. Other employees say that they were not properly trained to handle some hazardous chemicals, and have experienced burns, rashes and eye injuries.Tesla has said that the dismissals were based only on performance reviews and that it would never act against employees based on their union views. It will not discuss individual cases.While Tesla acknowledges that the plant\u2019s injury rate has exceeded industry averages in the past, it says on-the-job injuries have been steadily declining.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rev-Up: Imagining a 20% Self-Driving World", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "Call it 20 percent: the day, if it ever arrives, that one out of five vehicles you encounter will be driving itself. In some ways, the 20 percent era is harder to imagine than the fully automated era, because this supposedly unstoppable and frictionless technology will still be embroiled in a total mess. The best, safest models will most likely come with the highest price tags, out of reach for those with average incomes. Coexistence between human and robot drivers will be uneasy at best; road rage against the machine will boil over. One catastrophic accident could still imperil the whole experiment, no matter what the overall statistics show.But that inevitable mess is precisely what makes the one-in-five future so interesting to ponder. It\u2019s the first point, give or take, when it will be clear that a true self-driving future is even possible. When car companies will actually be able to rip out the steering wheels from some models, designing them in entirely different ways. When big trucking firms and car services like Uber will have begun to remove drivers from their vehicles. When hypercommuters will trust their cars to drive them three hours to the office while they sleep. When you might risk putting your child in one, alone.The autonomous vehicle went from test-track prototype to showroom reality far faster than I envisioned, propelled as much by advances in sensors and A.I. as by a collective hype cycle that seemed intent on willing these devices into existence, whether society was ready for them or not. Sitting with that \u201cbeginner\u201d driver in 2008, as engineers closely observed its movements, took me back to that life-defining moment of getting a driver\u2019s license. In my wallet, sparse with a library card and a school-lunch ticket, the license had real heft. It represented a primordial entry point to adulthood, a vast expansion of social possibility.As a rite, the driver\u2019s exam \u2014 I have failed it in two countries \u2014 is a ritual by turns (three-point, of course!) tedious and terrifying. If you can summon nothing else of the 1988 teen comedy \u201cLicense to Drive,\u201d you can still see James Avery\u2019s gleefully malevolent D.M.V. examiner, wielding his famous coffee cup. Once autonomous technology begins to really take off, will the driver\u2019s license, and the pedagogy behind it, go the way of the stick shift? Will the ability to drive begin to seem some exotic, rarely necessary skill \u2014 like starting a fire with a flint?After all, in a vehicle that meets the Level 5 automation criteria of SAE International \u2014 \u201cfull-time performance by an Automated Driving System for all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions\u201d \u2014 there would seem to be little point in possessing this vestigial skill. We don\u2019t require people entering elevators, riding in airport trams or letting Roombas loose upon their living rooms to be able to take over operation in case of machine failure; it\u2019s hard to see why our interaction with this automated technology should be any different. Our learning process could be as quick and dirty as it is with other high-tech products: Toss out the instruction manual and watch someone do it on YouTube.But this possibility, driver made passenger, broaches new territory in jurisprudence. With no licenses, what is the legal basis for restricting anyone \u2014 tweens, the elderly \u2014 from being ferried about? Young farm kids\u2019 driving the family truck seems as obsolete as tail fins, but what\u2019s stopping kids from being driven? Could children, often more adept at handling the smartphones of their parents than their owners are, have an advantage on older drivers less accustomed to technology? Yet the same fears that keep parents from letting their children walk to school may prevail over the allure of their autonomous vehicle handling the school run. It seems hard to say whether autonomous vehicles would hasten or delay the passage to adulthood.And as drivers interact with semiautonomous vehicles in the long run-up to Level 5, driver education and licensing, far from becoming obsolete, may become more important, argues John D. Lee, a professor of engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cAutomation has a strong tendency to surprise people with unexpected behavior,\u201d he says. Knowing what your car is doing \u2014 and when to take over \u2014 could be more vital than merely knowing how to drive. That water on the road \u2014 is it a surface puddle, or a veritable lake filling a gigantic pothole? That truck ahead with the dangerously swaying load \u2014 do you speed up to pass it? Is the pedestrian by the marked crosswalk waiting for you to yield or simply checking his iPhone? \u201cDriving and managing the automation that is helping you drive,\u201d Lee says, \u201care two quite different skill sets. Automation-management skills need to be learned as much as driving skills.\u201dTom Vanderbilt is the author of \u201cYou May Also Like\u201d and \u201cTraffic.\u201dDriverless cars will sometimes need to move around the city with no humans in them at all \u2014 en route to pickups or drop-offs. As empty moving vehicles become a common sight, they\u2019re sure to enable an annoying off-label use: a flowering youth subculture of external joy riding, similar to subway surfing.All over the country, bored teenagers will lurk on the roadside, waiting to leap onto the roofs of empty cars, hanging on for as long as they can. The surfers will take advantage of advances in cloaking technology to help them confuse the cars\u2019 sensors. Some will develop a clever assortment of grips and attachments to help them stay on, although the best among them will sneer at those who need to use tools. Fatalities will be inevitable, and often gruesome.To keep the kids off, car owners will try to coat their cars in slick repellents; these will be effective but too messy to be practical. Soon, dealers of autonomous cars will offer optional rows of spikes similar to those we already use to keep homeless people off benches. Once again, design will become more hostile in the name of safety.Rollo Romig is a journalist based in New York.Liberated from having to watch the road, commuters\u2019 eyes will be free to \u2014 what else? \u2014 consume video content. Sound\u2019s hold on drive time \u2014 first with terrestrial radio, then satellite radio, then podcasts \u2014 will gave way to sight. But what kind of videos will we watch? If Marchetti\u2019s constant holds (this is the idea that as transportation technology and urban planning change, people contort their lives to keep their commutes to an average of one hour per day), they will be not feature films but TV shows and short videos of the kind being increasingly produced for Facebook and YouTube. Podcasts will be displaced by vodcasts. Media companies are already negotiating with carmakers about how to price their offerings. Should in-car entertainment work more like cable or like the on-demand system in a hotel? Like Netflix or like Roku?Most riders who play games will use their phones. But by the time one in five cars is autonomous, console makers will develop specific products for it. The nearly two hours a day of console gaming played by some 60 million Americans will tick up accordingly. Swarms of commuters hitting the morning and evening roads in waves will become swarms of druids or mercenaries in massively multiplayer online games, some of which might come to incorporate the driving experience itself, a Pok\u00e9mon Go for the highway.It seems less likely that we\u2019ll use this opportunity to steal time back from screens. But if there\u2019s enough space for a table, maybe commuters will sit around it playing poker or telling stories. Cars are, indeed, the most private places we have, sealed shut, out of earshot. (The writer Nicholson Baker has said that he likes to write while in a car parked in a shady spot.)Chris Anderson \u2014 formerly the editor of Wired, now the head of a drone-data company and, in his spare time, of a racing league for autonomous cars \u2014 says the question of what we\u2019ll do inside self-driving cars always comes up at cocktail parties. It always confounds him. \u201cWe have this world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s called the back seat of an Uber.\u201d We already know what passengers do in back seats, be they in a limo or an R.V. or a tour bus: They pull out their phones or their iPads, or they talk to one another, or they take a nap. Why should we think that not having a driver will change anything?In an essay for Real Life magazine titled \u201cPerpetual Motion Machines,\u201d Chenoe Hart argues that we miss something when we think of autonomous cars this way, as a difference in degree, not in kind. Because we won\u2019t have to worry about driving, vehicle interiors can expand to a point where we\u2019 stop thinking of them as vehicles: They might have fully functional kitchens, or gyms, or beds. Instead of going to the coffee shop, the coffee shop might come to you; instead of going into the garage to pull out your car, the garage will be the car. The ability to summon spaces like this, Hart writes, will turn the built environment into a kind of random-access memory \u2014 with every destination equally accessible from anywhere. Whether it drove to you or you to it will be irrelevant; motion will be so smooth and constant as to be imperceptible. Hart argues that when travel becomes fully autonomous, we will always be traveling: families or co-workers in quiet concert on giant roads, moving in a cluster of moving buildings, chasing good weather, hardly aware that we\u2019re going anywhere at all.James Somers is a writer and programmer based in New York.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.It\u2019s not as straightforward as it sounds. For one thing, the vehicles would not be freed from the laws of physics. Should your car abruptly brake while you were, for example, running on a treadmill, the treadmill would cease moving forward \u2014 but you wouldn\u2019t, at least until you hit a windshield or door.It might be easier to remain seated. \u201cThe car could have special pockets all over the place that hold resistance bands of different strengths,\u201d says Bryant Johnson, a personal trainer and the author of \u201cThe Ruth Bader Ginsburg Workout.\u201d \u201cYou could use those to get a full-body strength-training workout.\u201dThroughout your commute, your future car could scrutinize your efforts, says Steve McCauley, the head of health services for the Wynn Las Vegas resort, with fingertip monitors or other sensors tracking your heart rate and the composition of your sweat.But realistically, many of us will use our salvaged commuting time otherwise. In tomorrow\u2019s cars, the area beneath the hood may not be needed for a combustion engine, Vujicic says \u2014 but it will remain, for reasons of mechanical stability and safety. Fitted with some padding and a safety belt, it becomes a napping cave.If self-driving cars start to make up a significant portion of urban traffic, they\u2019re likely to push cities to become more populous and compact, with fewer owned vehicles and more car sharing. The future, that is, would look more like Singapore, one of the world\u2019s densest cities, whose government in recent years has tried to curb car ownership and ease congestion problems. We reached out to Limin Hee, the director of research at Singapore\u2019s Center for Livable Cities, to ask her about how she thinks autonomous cars will begin to change urban life.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.These exploits, though dramatic, took advantage of the same vulnerabilities in cellular networks that might plague any tablet or smart vacuum cleaner. But a future in which one in five vehicles is autonomous will not only increase the attack \u201csurface\u201d (in the metaphor favored by researchers) of the car; it will also force manufacturers to confront more insidious security risks that are only now coming into view. It will become possible to compromise vehicles by hacking the environment.A car that drives itself uses sensors to construct high-resolution images of its surroundings, then runs them through a \u201cclassifier\u201d to identify all the objects in the image. The classifier can do this because it has trained on labeled images; after seeing a hundred thousand trucks, it learns to recognize certain features as indicating truck-ness. Today\u2019s most popular and effective classifiers for object recognition, used widely in self-driving car software, are called deep neural networks.But a deep neural network offers researchers very little understanding of why objects become classified as they do. Think of its output as a map, with each classification corresponding, like a ZIP code, to some demarcated region. Instead of existing in just two dimensions, though, the map has more like a thousand dimensions \u2014 and the slightest move in any one of these dimensions can push us into a different ZIP code and produce a false classification. This makes it possible for a hacker to construct slightly perturbed images, called \u201cadversarial examples,\u201d that look innocuous to the human eye but fool the car\u2019s brain into making the wrong call, with potentially fatal consequences.Adversarial examples are extremely difficult to defend against. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand these attacks,\u201d says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut the deeper question is that we don\u2019t understand deep neural networks.\u201d In a recent paper, Song and her co-authors introduced a method of constructing robust adversarial examples that can even be printed on paper and pasted to road signs. A stop sign defaced with specially calibrated graffiti, for instance, is recognized as a 45 m.p.h. speed-limit sign.Song\u2019s warning extends beyond road infrastructure. While researchers for decades have been working on \u2014 and developing countermeasures for \u2014 software vulnerabilities, the study of security issues related to deep learning is still in its infancy. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a precise mathematical definition of a pedestrian,\u201d Song says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for us to write down a formula describing exactly what a pedestrian is. So we can\u2019t even really define our security goals.\u201d Even with a recent surge of interest in adversarial examples, researchers are still struggling to understand the scope of the problem. Given the physical-world ramifications, Song says, \u201cwe should have started even sooner.\u201dYiren Lu is a writer and software engineer in New York.The trickiest part of the transition to a self-driving future may be figuring out liability when accidents do happen. Instead of quarreling only about which driver was at fault, we will also be able to argue about whether the self-driving features in either car may have played a role. A preview of these complications was evident in the aftermath of the crash that killed Joshua Brown, the Ohio man whose autopiloted Tesla ran into a tractor-trailer. Federal investigators determined that the accident was not caused by a defect in the autopilot software, and Tesla has said repeatedly that drivers should always have their hands on the wheel even when they are using the technology. But officials noted that Tesla\u2019s technology was unable to detect cross-traffic like that presented by the tractor-trailer. Tesla subsequently updated its software to make similar accidents less likely in the future.So who was responsible for covering the damages? The insurance policy that covered Brown, who may not have fully understood the capabilities of his car, or Tesla? Neither Tesla nor Brown\u2019s family has commented on who paid. And both car insurers and insurance regulators have been relatively slow to contend with the difficulty in assigning liability when a person is driving a car only part of the time. \u201cInsurance policies have not necessarily caught up with the global advancement of A.I. technology in cars,\u201d Brown\u2019s lawyer told me.Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley, which is racing to raise the curtain on the era of autonomous vehicles, is also thinking about insurance. A start-up called Driav intends to bring down insurance rates by monitoring the reams of data coming out of self-driving cars in order to figure out, on a second-to-second basis, who or what caused the errors that led to a crash. \u201cIt\u2019s silly that claims are a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 argument,\u201d Dan Peate, Driav\u2019s chief executive, told me. \u201cThe data can just tell us what happened.\u201d The company hopes to begin offering insurance policies next year, with the expectation that they will be cheaper in part because the cars will be in fewer accidents and in part because it plans to be able to shift some liability onto the carmakers.In the long run, when all vehicles are driving themselves, the manufacturers themselves are very likely to assume all of the blame for accidents. Most such companies have said that they plan to pay for anything that happens while their cars and software are in charge. When that\u2019s the case, insurance begins to look a lot more like a product warranty, covered by the carmaker, than a stand-alone product that a customer has to worry about. But in the transition years until then, there are likely to be a lot more messy arguments.Nathaniel Popper is a technology reporter for The Times.When I think about the future these days, I inevitably return to a tweet from the writer Elizabeth Hamilton-Argyropoulos (a.k.a. @bourgeoisalien): \u201cThe saddest part about self-driving cars will be all the times people die mid-trip and then ur dinner guests or pizza guy will arrive dead.\u201d To read this joke is to become immediately certain that this will absolutely happen \u2014 of course it will! \u2014 and that it will furthermore become as much a part of the texture of everyday future life as, say, traffic delays caused by collisions are now. Admittedly, the dead-pizza-guy notion doesn\u2019t seem very likely: A large part of the impetus behind the development of self-driving technology in the first place is the desire to do away with the need for flesh-and-blood people who demand wages for their work. But the image feels symbolically resonant precisely because of the ghostly future of all those moribund jobs. Self-driving cars bearing the earthly remains of the recently deceased \u2014 automated Ubers, say, with heart-attack victims sprawled incredulously across the rear seat \u2014 are, in this sense, an extreme metaphor for the near future of capitalism. The technology will be miraculous, yes; but if it functions as intended, it will serve as an uncanny vector of human obsolescence.Mark O\u2019Connell is a writer based in Dublin.\u201cRide-sharing\u201d was always a misnomer for companies like Uber and Lyft. As with the rest of the \u201csharing economy,\u201d nothing was ever being shared; labor and services were being bought and sold. But as ride-share companies have grown, their ambitions have multiplied and compounded. Currently, their horizons are limited by widespread car ownership, alternative transit options and, primarily, their own cost. But autonomous cars make their grander plans \u2014 dreams of vast fleets of perfectly allocated and used vehicles \u2014 more plausible. They zero out a single variable, the cost of labor, that these companies believe is holding them back from utterly reshaping the world. Ride-share businesses are uniquely poised to manifest and demonstrate the big ideas of self-driving cars. They aren\u2019t waiting for this change; they\u2019re doing everything in their power to hasten it. Autonomous cars aren\u2019t just part of the plan; they are the plan.Conservative estimates put the world\u2019s Ubers and Lyfts in an enviable position as self-driving cars roll out. Bullish projections put them in an unassailable one. A 2017 report by Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest, told the story in four numbers. A rider\u2019s \u201call-in cost per mile\u201d for average United States taxi services was about $3.50. For a human-driven Uber in San Francisco, that number was about $2.86. Assuming the same fuel price, the figure for personal cars is much lower, at around 70 cents. The estimate for self-driving taxi services, circa 2020, would cut that cost in half.At 35 cents per mile, tasks that were previously too expensive or that would have felt ridiculous become reasonable and routine. A world in which moving yourself or moving things to you costs almost nothing in terms of money or attention would remake places and transform lives. It would also bring with it new and complicated absurdities \u2014 the sort Americans adapt to quickly and then forget. (Like bottles of water shipped around the world and sold for $2, or electronics products assembled in one country from parts from six others, to be shipped to a seventh.)Riders will thrill to this new infrastructure as it incorporates the roads around them, providing novel experiences and conveniences. But this excitement will prevent us from seeing that our aspiring fleet managers hope to create something like the profound consolidation of the internet\u2019s recent past. Just as Amazon the online store laid the groundwork for Amazon the comprehensive and omnipresent service, apps for human-driven taxis may have laid the groundwork for a thrumming on-demand grid, on which people and things can be placed and retrieved.Like Google and Facebook before them, which remapped, rerouted and dominated the old and diverse web infrastructure on which they were built, Uber and Lyft could say, credibly, that they work better with size and full participation. That market domination is merely the flip side of completeness. They will aspire to monopoly and could achieve, with startling speed, real and unprecedented claims over the roads we share \u2014 they will say they\u2019ve found a better use for them, and if all goes to plan, riders will agree.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The Times.Unless you\u2019re a millionaire or a truck driver, your first encounter with a self-driving vehicle will probably be a car you ordered through a ride-hailing app like Lyft or Uber. These companies, which spent the first stage of their lives trying to get drivers into their cars, are spending the next one trying to get them out. There will be some initial awkwardness around self-driving vehicles, just as there was around ride-hailing in the first place. (Remember when it was weird to get into a stranger\u2019s unmarked car?)But Lyft, for one, is betting that it can put a trustable face on the tech. In July, it announced Level 5, a lab where it will work on its own driverless software, in addition to developing an open self-driving network that companies like Ford and Jaguar Land Rover will be able to plug their vehicles into. The idea of the network is to combine multiple kinds of autonomous vehicles under one routing-and-request system, so that when you order a Lyft, the app will assess your route, check the weather and other factors and send you the best ride, whether that\u2019s an autonomous Waymo or a human-driven S.U.V. John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s co-founder and president, explained its thinking.Kevin Roose is a business columnist for The Times and a writer at large for the magazine.For reasons that have gone unstudied, humans become horny in transit. With the proliferation of subway systems came the proliferation of subway gropers. With commercial air travel came the \u201cMile High Club.\u201d Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee filmed their famous sex tape on a boat (I\u2019m told). There\u2019s something about transportation that gets people in the mood. What is it?My theory is simple. In our capacity as humans, we have three speeds at which we operate: crawl, walk and run. In other words: extremely slow, slow and slightly less slow. When we engage with equipment that increases our velocity, we become excited. This excitement applies in all cases, whether we\u2019re talking about an escalator, a moving walkway, a bicycle, a roller coaster, a golf cart or a Chrysler LeBaron. It is fundamentally thrilling to travel at an unexpected speed. When the enabling mode of transportation is one that permits our excitement to be processed as erotic energy \u2014 even if that processing is specifically legislated against \u2014 some of us will do that. The distance between \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cstimulated\u201d is, after all, incredibly short. If there were a way to have sex on a bicycle, people would be bike-sexing all the time. It would have its own verb.Having sex in a car is not currently impossible, but it is difficult. Hand-eye coordination, a mechanism critical for sex-having, is compromised for the driver, whose hands must remain on the wheel and eyes on the road. In road couplings, the driver is not an equal contributor. Unless, of course, the driver doesn\u2019t need to drive at all. Which brings us to the self-driving car: basically a motel room on wheels. The one hindrance to this development is existing public-lewdness laws, which are fairly expansive. You can\u2019t intentionally get naked and perform a \u201clewd act\u201d in a public place without risk of penalty. Obviously. But you also run a risk if you perform your lewd act in a private place with the intention of being watched \u2014 say, in a self-driven automobile slowly cruising past a school bus where my future grandchildren are watching in horror as a frenzied orgy unfolds within smelling distance. I am confident, however, that the law will be updated to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable car-based encounters.And if not, industrial designers can come up with clever \u201csolves,\u201d the word that start-ups use for some reason instead of \u201csolutions.\u201d If car windows no longer need to function as navigating aids, why not tint them to inky obscurity? Or replace them with mirrors facing outward? Or mirrors facing inward? Or remove them entirely? Future riders may not even need a human partner in order to have an intimate appointment. Nissan is working with Microsoft to develop an \u201cin-vehicle virtual personal assistant\u201d which, if deviously hacked, could provide the 21st-century equivalent of phone sex.More interesting than the aesthetics of car sex will be the cultural consequences. New slang terms will arise. New positions. New trophies. (How many times can you have sex in the time it takes to drive from Las Vegas to Los Angeles?) Virginities will be lost, children conceived, marriage vows consummated and violated. Car-based kinks will be minted and postcoital rituals established. New professional opportunities will emerge: interior decorators who specialize in \u201cself-driving bedrooms\u201d; entrepreneurs who launch apps to enable no-strings-attached in-car assignations. Preferences will be identified and explored. The world will expand in narrow but pulse-quickening ways \u2014 not a sexual revolution, but a plot twist.Molly Young is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Wins and Who Loses From the Republican Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Veterans of previous efforts to rewrite the tax code warn that overhauling the tax code is hard because it creates winners and losers \u2014 and the losers fight harder than the winners to make sure the legislation fails.The tax plan released by House Republicans on Thursday did not disappoint, cutting taxes and erasing popular deductions in ways that would reorient big chunks of the American economy.The bill loses revenue in some areas and raises it in others, and those are where the battle lines will be drawn in the coming weeks, as members of Congress scramble pass a law that President Trump wants to sign by Christmas.Slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent would be a boon to firms that for years have complained of being shackled by high taxes. It remains to be seen if the benefits of this lower rate would be felt more by shareholders or workers. In selling the plan, Republicans have said that employees of companies would see their salaries rise because of a lower corporate tax rate.\u201cAnything that brings down corporate tax rates in the right way here in the United States would be helpful,\u201d Kevin P. Clark, chief executive of Delphi Automotive, said on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call.American multinational companies fare well under the plan, which calls for shifting toward a more territorial tax system, albeit with caveats. The plan levies a 10 percent global minimum tax on overseas earnings, but that\u2019s still far below the current 35 percent they need to pay on income that\u2019s returned home. In theory, the new system will reduce the \u201clockout\u201d effect that encourages firms to stash cash abroad.The plan would also force companies to pay a one-time 12 percent tax on \u201cliquid\u201d assets that are held overseas, like cash. They would have eight years to pay the tax.The Republican tax plan would collapse the income tax brackets to three from seven and nearly double the standard deduction, meaning many middle class families would see smaller tax bills. However, this impact will vary depending on every taxpayer\u2019s individual situation. People who live in high-tax states and currently itemize their tax returns could pay more because of the limitations on the state and local tax deduction.The capping of the mortgage interest deduction could also impact middle class families who live in states with high property taxes. And, if the legislation dampens home prices, as realtors are warning, it could diminish the wealth of middle class families whose biggest investment is generally their home.Despite all of the talk about helping the middle class, it is hard to argue that the wealthy do not benefit from the tax plan. The top tax rate for millionaires holds steady at 39.6 percent, while the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax or A.M.T. \u2014 which hit primarily wealthy Americans \u2014 are ultimately eliminated. Mr. Trump, a billionaire, has criticized the \u201cdeath tax\u201d and the A.M.T. provisions over the years as unfair.President Trump campaigned on getting rid of the so-called carried interest loophole, which allows fees paid to some of the richest people on Wall Street to be taxed at low capital gains rates, not income tax rates. But it makes no appearance in the House plan.Carried interest, which is essentially the profits reaped by hedge fund managers and private equity executives, is currently taxed at a long-term capital gains rate that is about half the roughly 40 percent ordinary income rate for the highest earners.The tax plan doubles the standard deduction and caps the mortgage interest deduction at $500,000, down from $1 million. It also caps property deductions at $10,000. This significantly weakens a tax incentive that has encouraged many Americans to buy homes rather than rent. Homebuilders and realtors quickly came out against the bill, warning that it could create a recession in the housing market and cause a slide in home prices.Under the Republican plan, the deduction for medical expenses would be eliminated. This currently applies to taxpayers, spouses or other dependents with health expenses that exceed a tenth of the taxpayer\u2019s income. AARP, which advocates for retirees, said that they strongly opposed the repeal of the deduction and said that doing so would impose a \u201chealth tax\u201d on the oldest and sickest Americans.Like the housing industry, charities are also fretting about the impact of doubling the standard deduction. While charitable deductions are preserved in the plan, middle class families that take advantage of the larger standard deduction could be less likely to give to charity as a way of reducing their taxable income. This, in turn, could mean less giving.Currently, private universities are exempt from the tax that private foundations pay on their investment income. That would change under the Republican plan, which would levy a 1.4 percent excise tax on private colleges and universities with at least 500 students and assets that are valued at $100,000 per full-time student. The plan will likely draw strong opposition from the higher education community. It would raise $3 billion in revenue over a decade.The tax plan calls for the repeal of a tax credit that drug companies use to perform clinical testing for drugs that treat rare diseases. The credit is central to the business model for such firms and eliminating it could mean that big pharmaceutical companies will have little reason to invest in drugs that help small patient populations.Republicans used to consider themselves deficit hawks, but their plan will add at least $1.5 trillion to the federal debt over a decade. Many economists think that it will be more than this, because Republican tax-writers are using optimistic assumptions about economic growth when assessing their plan. If deficits continue to swell, it would depress economic growth and lawmakers would likely have to consider raising taxes or cutting spending to compensate as an aging population puts pressure on federal entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.The Republican plan repeals the tax credit currently allowed for taxpayers who own a \u201cqualified plug-in electric-drive motor vehicle.\u201d Under current law, a taxpayer may claim a maximum credit of $7,500 for each qualified plug-in electric-drive motor vehicle placed in service. The bill would take that benefit away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Corporate Taxes, Musk vs. Buffett, and Will Fox Strike a Deal?", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Profits at America\u2019s biggest companies grew 6.2 percent, driven largely by technology firms.\u2022 Railroad companies are on notice. Elon Musk is coming for them.\u2022 Stitch Fix is the only tech company led by a woman to go public this year.\u2022 21st Century Fox is courting several interested buyers. But the Justice Department may not let a big media marriage happen. That is one of the many debated questions. Proponents of the Republicans\u2019 plans argue that companies will invest the money. Opponents counter that firms will return the cash to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends.\u201cWhen all variables are measured properly, it seems major companies are paying out to shareholders about 22 percent of their net income. It\u2019s therefore unlikely that new profit, as might follow from lower corporate tax rates, will simply be drained out of the corporation.\u201cMore generally, sending money back to investors doesn\u2019t have to mean no new investment. What if those investors take the money and put it in a venture capital fund or invest it in some other manner? The whole point of capital markets is to recycle resources into the most profitable new opportunities, and that may or may not involve the companies that initially earned those profits.\u201dWith 95 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported third-quarter results, earnings are on pace to grow 6.2 percent from a year earlier, according to FactSet. That\u2019s up from the 3.1 percent growth rate expected at the end of period.Technology companies drove much of the growth. The sector reported a 19.7 percent increase in earnings and was the biggest contributor to earnings growth rate. If the tech sector was excluded, the overall growth rate would fall to 2.8 percent from 6.2 percent.Here are some more takeaways from earnings season:\u2022 Profits at companies that generate more that 50 percent of their sales outside the United States, grew more than 13 percent in the third quarter. Earnings at firms that get a majority of their revenue from within the U.S., rose only 2.3 percent.That is a reversal of what many analysts expected at the beginning of 2017. A stronger American dollar, a pickup in the United State\u2019s economy, and the Trump administration\u2019s policies were expected to benefit companies with the greatest exposure to United States were expected to benefit more from the Trump administration\u2019s policies, and a stronger dollar. But the United States dollar remained weaker.\u2022 The energy sector reported the largest increase in earnings of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors at 135 percent. The increase is a reflection of how hard the roughly two year slide in oil prices had hit the industry.\u2022 74 percent of companies have reported profits above analysts expectations, above the five-year average of 69 percent.\u2022 Financial firms reported the biggest decline in profits, down 8.3 percent. That decline can largely be blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Insurance companies in the sector reported 63 percent decrease in profits.\u2022 90 percent of the companies in the S&P 500\u2019s technology sector exceeded analyst estimates.\u2014 Stephen GrocerA traditional diesel truck can be operated for $1.51 a mile; the Tesla Semi, he said, beats that with $1.26.But it gets better. Using convoys \u2014 Tesla Semis yoked together with connected Autopilot technology, operating like road-going trains, with one semi as the leader \u2014 Tesla\u2019s cost drops to $0.85 a mile.\u201cThis beats rail,\u201d Musk said.Warren Buffett, of course, has bet big on railroads. In November 2009, his Berkshire Hathaway bought Burlington Northern Santa Fe. It was, he said at the time, a bet on the United States economy as it rebounded from the financial crisis.The online retailer\u2019s shares opened at $16.90, up 13 percent in its first day of trading.The I.P.O. differs from the typical Silicon Valley start-up that hits the public markets. The company kept its valuation relatively low, and it has generated a profit two years in a row.In fact, only 4.2 percent of all I.P.O.s in the United States were led by woman from 2000 to 2015. That compares to 6.4 percent of Fortune 500 companies run by a woman.The reasons are well known: The internet and newer players like Netflix have upended the media and telecom landscapes. Size and scale seem more important than ever. It\u2019s the premise of the AT&T and Time Warner deal, which itself echoes Comcast buying NBCUniversal.More in media consolidationAcross the industry, digital-media companies are finding that lines of business that caught fire for them early on \u2014 like creating custom content for brands \u2014 are becoming harder to scale up. Meanwhile, with each passing year, Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. are tightening their grip on the online-ad market.Extra creditThe leak of 210,000 gallons in South Dakota came days before the Public Services Commission of Nebraska is to vote on a permit for the pipeline\u2019s bigger sibling, Keystone XL.After his election, President Trump issued an executive order to clear obstacles for the Keystone XL, but TransCanada still needed a permit from the independent, five-person Nebraska PSC. Concerns there have revolved around potential harm to the state\u2019s ecologically delicate Sandhills region and its vast Ogallala aquifer, prompting TransCanada to move the Nebraska segment further east.What else have people found in the tax overhaul?The goal is to hit the ground running in overhauling an agency that some Republicans have called corrupt and that GOP lawmakers widely blame for burdening lenders with unnecessary red tape. It could be months before Trump nominates a permanent C.F.P.B. director and the Senate confirms his selection.The $1 trillion investor is talking about selling all of its holdings in oil companies. That\u2019s likely to give the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, which is working on an I.P.O., some heartburn.\u201cThe Norwegian view is that oil has had a good run and will have a good run for a couple of decades but it\u2019s not the only future that is out there.\u201dChina knows that, as demand for oil declines in much of the developed world, ever more of Aramco\u2019s barrels must flow east anyway. So the idea it will buy a big slug of Aramco at anything more than a discounted price \u2014 without some sort of sweetener in terms of a low-priced oil supply contract anyway \u2014 is a stretch.It\u2019s made by Tesla, of course. And it\u2019s both battery-powered and almost entirely self-driving.\u201cThe point of doing this is to give a hard-core smackdown to gasoline cars,\u201d he said to a cheering crowd of more than 2,000 people. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco and back.\u201dThe online clothing seller priced its stock market debut at $15 a share, well below its expected range. Is that because while the company is profitable, Jeff Bezos could yet crush it?The challenge that Stitch Fix faces is one that has burdened other start-ups like the food delivery service Blue Apron and the social networking phenomenon Snapchat: incumbent giants that have the money and the hunger to crush upstart rivals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Full Tilt: When 100% of Cars Are Autonomous", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "Urban-transportation experts have been busily creating computer simulations to show how this might work. In one model, each crossroads would have an \u201cintersection manager,\u201d a computer that senses the approaching traffic and uses wireless communication to talk to the oncoming cars. When each self-driving car is perhaps 300 yards away, it sends a request to the intersection manager \u2014 to turn right, say, or to move on through. The intersection manager then does an on-the-fly calculation to route that vehicle most efficiently, like an omnipotent and tireless traffic cop.The result? A ballet of cars whizzing and weaving past one another in the intersection. Some slow down as they approach; others pass straight through. But crucially, compared with today\u2019s intersections, many fewer cars come to a complete halt.This could significantly speed up traffic throughout an entire city. Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who works with one model, has found that the \u201cdelay\u201d time at intersections shrinks remarkably. \u201cRight now, it takes me an average of 20 minutes to get to work, but with autonomous-car intersections, it might be half that time,\u201d he says. Safety would be enhanced, too: Forty-three percent of car crashes in the United States occur at intersections, and Stone predicts that robot vehicles would crash only if there was a mechanical error. Better yet, autonomous intersections could produce an estimated 20 to 50 percent less carbon dioxide, because there would be fewer idling cars and jack-rabbit starts. \u201cThat\u2019s the most expensive and most polluting part of driving,\u201d says Remi Tachet des Combes, a mathematician who created robot-intersection models while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.For the human passenger, though, a robotized intersection could be mildly terrifying \u2014 like flying through a crowded asteroid belt, trusting the A.I. to find the right path. \u201cAt first I think it will be freaky,\u201d Stone admits. \u201cSome people will need the window darkened so they don\u2019t freak out.\u201d But in the long run, we\u2019ll probably shrug, get used to it and barely look up from our games of Candy Crush as we zip through. And pedestrians? They would probably push a button at the intersection to request their turn \u2014 or even use a smartphone app.More subtly unsettling, however, might be the spectacle of a city devoid of stoplights. Indeed, devoid of all major street signs: no huge billboards across highways naming the exits, no complex merge instructions. Those signs are expensive to build and maintain. They\u2019re designed for humans, and GPS-brained robots don\u2019t need them to know where they\u2019re going. Certainly, human pedestrians and cyclists will still need guideposts, but as Stone suspects, far fewer, and smaller, ones.A world with almost no street signs would feel strange. It could make a city less cluttered and more attractive. But it might also leave us feeling unmoored. Social critics worry that GPS has already eroded our knowledge of the city; some studies have found that the more we rely on devices, the less we deeply intuit where we are and how to navigate on our own. \u201cWe become more helpless,\u201d as Greg Milner, the author of \u201cPinpoint,\u201d a history of GPS, told me. If robots rule the roads, we might get where we\u2019re going a lot more quickly \u2014 but end up not knowing precisely where we are.Clive Thompson is the author of \u201cSmarter Than You Think: How Technology Is Changing Our Minds for the Better.\u201dDeveloped by Marshall Brown, Lili Du, Laura Forlano, Jack Guthman, and Ron Henderson. Visual Design by Maryam HeidaripourBrown is a creator of the Driverless City Project, an interdisciplinary research initiative at I.I.T. that takes a playful, rigorous approach to envisioning the fully autonomous future. The project helps participants generate various situations for a city in order to determine how autonomous cars will fit into the picture. Central to the project is a \u201cmind map\u201d representing the group\u2019s research, organized into four areas of impact: street space, parking space, commuter space and delivery space. The map, as well as other tools \u2014 including a set of large tokens for scenario building, like a tarot deck for urbanists \u2014 is meant to encourage others to be ambitious and creative about the world in which they want to live. \u201cWe should write the future,\u201d Brown says, \u201crather than trying to predict it.\u201dBrown has found two prevalent attitudes when it comes to self-driving vehicles: either an active but unimaginative approach, rushing to build robots to accommodate the world as it is now, or a totally passive approach, a sort of \u201cwait and see.\u201d The first, he says, is characteristic of the tech industry; the second, of the public sector. \u201cI hear too much surrendering in the question about our future right now,\u201d he adds. \u201cJust surrendering to Google or Amazon, or surrendering to your phone, or surrendering to a driverless car. We should not surrender.\u201dOne way to stave off surrender, Brown believes, is to invite more diverse thinkers, like architects and urban planners, into the process of imagining and designing the autonomous future. (He also listed sociologists, fiction writers, Buddhist monks, poets and rabbis as useful stakeholders.) The current discourse around the future of autonomous vehicles is centered on \u201ctechnologically deterministic fantasies,\u201d Brown says. He\u2019s concerned that technological values \u2014 like logic, predictability and efficiency \u2014 will be erroneously imposed upon the built environment, leading to urban spaces that fail to take into account delight, pleasure or human connection. \u201cA society is cultural, and political, and aesthetic, and about desires \u2014 it\u2019s not just how you solve problems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to need more than just software engineers working on it.\u201dAs an architect, Brown is especially attuned to the unlocked aesthetic potential of urban environments. Today\u2019s visual clutter, necessary for keeping human-driven cars as nonlethal as possible, could be eradicated. It is critical, in his view, to consider the beauty and quality of the world that self-driving cars could bring.It\u2019s worth considering, then, where cars will go when people don\u2019t need them. \u201cWhat happens when a car can park itself anywhere?\u201d Brown asks. He hypothesizes that parking, if performed robotically, could become \u201ca negative externality, not unlike that of a trash dump,\u201d should developers repurpose garages and parking lots for more lucrative uses. (Why look for parking in Greenwich Village if the car can park itself on the edge of New Jersey?) In the Midwest, he speculates, deindustrialized cities with waning property values could even be bought wholesale and transformed into vast, flat parking lots \u2014 a future that he deemed plausible, if \u201ctoo dystopian,\u201d in no small part because of the likelihood that it would be pushed upon lower-income communities. On the other hand, those same communities could benefit from increased mobility and access to employment.Brown is also considering the changes to storage: If robotic trucks constantly roam our landscape, will warehouses be abandoned? He\u2019s focused on the changing needs and desires of a human driver. To accommodate an autonomous, cross-country route, truck cabs, he speculates, may need to expand according to a driver\u2019s needs, perhaps going so far as to resemble a microapartment.An emphasis (or lack thereof) on efficiency also addresses the temporal dimension of cities: It favors \u2014 or facilitates \u2014 a working lifestyle in which there is never enough time. In a future of increased automation and accessibility, work culture may begin to shift; labor, and its attendant time constraints, may no longer be central to the urban experience. Brown envisions the possibility of a hands-free commute that opens up space for socializing \u2014 \u201can interior social world.\u201d Riders could chat with people in adjacent cars or simply take the opportunity to watch the world go by. (A more cynical take on this, he says, is that the hands-free commute will simply increase the demands on workers, as the car becomes an extension of the home office \u2014 a WeWork on wheels.)Second-order effects of autonomous vehicles tend to get lost in the techno-utopian chatter, but there seems to be an increasing awareness that self-driving cars won\u2019t just arrive in cities; they\u2019ll change them too. Some tech companies are beginning to get into data-driven city-building, a movement largely galvanized by the seeming inevitability of autonomous vehicles. Last year, Y Combinator announced a research initiative, New Cities, that aimed to study how to build a metropolis entirely from scratch. In mid-October, Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet subsidiary, announced that it will redevelop a 12-acre strip along Toronto\u2019s waterfront, called Quayside, which will integrate technology across the human experience. The vehicles it is planning to accommodate will be shared, electric and self-driving.Power and control over autonomous-vehicle technology is already concentrated in the hands of a small few: If a company like Uber or Alphabet controls the dominant transportation infrastructure, you need not live in an intentional community like Quayside to feel as though your city is becoming a company town. Brown is wary of the smart-cities initiative, and he resents the efforts of technology companies to fully saturate the human \u2014 and urban \u2014 experience. \u201cA city is not a problem to be solved,\u201d he says. \u201cA city is a cultural construct, even though it involves the deployment of technologies. A city is not science alone.\u201dAnna Wiener is a writer based in San Francisco.Tomorrow\u2019s could. Unlike Google Glass \u2014 which awkwardly placed screens where they didn\u2019t need to be \u2014 a car already requires a membrane between passengers and their environment. Why not turn that typically passive barrier into a dynamic canvas? Ordinary windows could be replaced with holographic glass or an advanced semitranslucent liquid-crystal display. They could anticipate our needs and instantaneously display weather forecasts, reviews of nearby restaurants and hotels, details about popular tourist attractions \u2014 and warnings about miserable tourist traps.As the technology improves and people become more comfortable obscuring their surroundings, your windows could begin to overlay a vast digital diorama onto passing scenery. Passengers would no longer have to wonder about the identity of a landmark and scramble to look it up on their phones. Instead, the car itself, wired with artificial intelligence, plugged into sophisticated mapping technology and equipped with magic eyes, would instantaneously recognize, annotate and augment its surroundings. A mountain, desert or coastline could become an interactive infographic, peeling away the physical surface of the earth to reveal hidden layers of geology. A self-directed double-decker bus ambling through London could rearrange the city like a Lego set, refashioning streets and buildings to illuminate the capital\u2019s rich history. Early television sets made the distant accessible; the self-driving car could reveal the invisible in the immediate.As exciting as such possibilities are, recent history suggests plenty of reasons to temper our optimism. When windows double as screens, we will have the opportunity to gaze at the world anew through richly animated portals. Alternatively \u2014 and perhaps more realistically \u2014 we could end up staring into larger versions of our phones, distracting ourselves with email, mindless games and the infinite bazaar of the internet. The potential of the autonomous vehicle is to help us interact with our environment in ways never before possible. The temptation is to turn ever more inward, exchanging the physical world for yet another simulation.Either way, self-driving cars with ubiquitous screens will inevitably bring all the familiar drawbacks of digital media onto the open road. Taxi TV in New York City is just a preview of the potential nightmare. What if the price for enchanted windows of the future is a nauseating kaleidoscope of advertisements, vapid movie reviews and contextless late-night jokes? Rather than learning about the hidden history of your surroundings, you may very well learn only about two-for-one cricket tacos in the food truck a lane over, homeowner\u2019s insurance for the Anthropocene or the sale on microdrones at a nearby mall. Don\u2019t want ads? No problem. You can upgrade to a premium account.Ferris Jabr is a writer based in Portland, Ore.One big question about the driverless car will be who gets to own our new wealth of free time. Will it remain with commuters \u2014 or will corporations expect them to tap into the office as their vehicles ferry them there? While the potential for hours of unplugged leisure exists, the way we currently fill our downtime leads me to believe that some form of digital immersion will take precedence, as bosses expect employees to work on their way to and from work. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the remaining minimum-wage positions in the rapidly automating food industry go to those who have access to driverless cars; use their cars for deliveries while they work, and you get two employees for the price of one.It\u2019s tricky. On their surface, driverless cars will take some of the mess out of living, but they can also take the living where they don\u2019t want to go, both psychologically and physically. Some car interiors might more closely resemble cubicles. Or cells. Will private employers surveil workers in order to control off-duty behavior? It\u2019s also easy to conceive of a future where newly created infrastructure, explicitly dedicated to automated vehicles, will enable people with the means to own the cars to avoid the people without.We should be wary of any technology that allows those with power to distance themselves even further from society.Rahawa Haile is an Eritrean-American writer of short stories and essays.Autonomous cars will once again transform teenage life. Anab Jain, a founder of the design studio Superflux, says the ritual requirements of teenage socializing will inspire \u201ca new range of acts and services that help you obfuscate your car\u2019s identity or your own data.\u201d Instead of trying to roll back the odometer on the family car \u00e0 la Ferris Bueller, teenagers hoping to roam the city, free from parental view, might trick it into recording destinations they didn\u2019t really visit. \u201cThe whole notion of freedom will change,\u201d Jain says, even as some of the destinations remain familiar. Dark streets or quiet state parks where GPS doesn\u2019t reach would be the coolest sites of all.The question of when, exactly, the party has started will also become an intriguing one: After all, each car is a room unto itself. The Situationist International, a loose group of artists, political agitators and heavy drinkers who roamed the streets of Paris and other cities in the 1960s, treating them as arenas for detours and debauchery, offers some clues about how such rooms could be transformed. \u201cI only ever hear self-driving cars talked about as a functional solution to the problem of getting from A to B,\u201d says McKenzie Wark, the author of a history of the Situationists called \u201cThe Beach Beneath the Street.\u201d (The title is a reference to the sand that was revealed when protesters picked up cobblestones from the Paris streets to throw at the police.) Wark imagines these machines rolling out of the factory with more radical settings hard-wired into their operating systems. \u201cA hybrid of the self-driving car and, say, Grindr could bring a whole new meaning to the concept of cruising,\u201d Wark suggests. \u201cThere should be a \u2018scenic route\u2019 setting, a \u2018random\u2019 setting, a \u2018surprise me\u2019 setting. Or maybe \u2018mystery destination,\u2019 which whisks you \u2014 and algorithmically chosen others \u2014 to an undisclosed location. Algorithmic chicken for teenage drivers, where you drive head-on toward another car \u2014 then magically swerve off at the last minute.\u201dUnlike today\u2019s cars, autonomous cars can also be made to swarm together, creating somewhat of a paradox: a moving traffic jam. Once the swarm is formed, proximity algorithms could mine social-media profiles to arrange like-minded clusters, while enabling \u201cshuffle mode\u201d might one day be the equivalent of texting a friend to rescue you from the boring guy in the corner. Aspiring D.J.s will rely on software to assemble self-driving cars into the ideal configuration for louder bass. Couples armed with GPS jammers \u2014 the future\u2019s perfect Valentine\u2019s Day gift \u2014 will quietly steer strangers away, creating a halo of romantic privacy around their makeout sessions. If all else fails, hit \u201cskip\u201d to be transported to an entirely new party.Hidden beneath the hormone haze of future block parties, new opportunities for cultural pranks and political protest will emerge. Rather than throw cobblestones, protesters could quickly jam the streets to show political solidarity or organize a strike. With the right programming skills, they might be able to shut down a whole city just by blocking a few crucial nodes. They could even open the streets back up to foot traffic, remaking them as a space for celebration. Then, of course, when it\u2019s time to go home, all those dull factory presets, optimized for safety and efficiency, will finally come into their own \u2014 no designated driver necessary.Geoff Manaugh is the author of \u201cA Burglar\u2019s Guide to the City.\u201dIn the self-driving future, a weed transaction will begin the same as always \u2014 by texting your dealer in search of \u201ctree,\u201d or by casually asking if he wants to \u201chang out.\u201d En route to another customer\u2019s house, he will text back immediately, freed from the imposition of two hands on the wheel. Memories of waiting impatiently on a flaky dealer will recede as his car appears on your app, predicting arrival time down to the minute. Watch as his vehicle weaves around school zones, or is maybe flagged and pulled over by the police. The new possibilities for surveillance are endless.In any case, if he makes it to your house, it is likely that he will emerge from his self-driving pod in a sweatshirt for a company with a name like T\u014dkTaxi or Gangl.ly or Lyft\u2019d. As weed begins to trend toward legality, we\u2019ve already seen such standing-desk branding start to creep into the stoner vernacular. A scan down PC Magazine\u2019s \u201c15 Blazing Hot Weed Tech Companies to Watch\u201d reveals Tokken (a blockchain system for dealers), MassRoots (a stoner social network) and Eaze (the obligatory \u201cUber for weed\u201d). In this new age of cannabis, the only thing that moves faster than the tech is the rate at which smoking itself becomes corny.But cringe-worthy orthography is not the only thing that this self-driven industry will inherit from Silicon Valley. In the age of semiautonomous cars, dealers will be forced to file 1099s, sharing their profits as lowly subcontractors. As in the time when dealers drove themselves, this fleet of buddies-for-hire will offer five to 10 minutes of humanity-affirming chitchat. Unlike preautonomous dealers, they will plead that you tweet their referral codes in order to receive a complimentary edible.This, of course, is one good reason to strive for fully autonomous drugmobiles. The driverless vehicle eliminates small talk, supplying your fix directly from the glove box with a personalized passcode, \u00e0 la Amazon Locker. With no human body attached to the cargo, suppliers will seek to move harder drugs, in bigger quantities, potentially unleashing a new set of problems. The narc, a liability throughout all of human history, isn\u2019t likely to go anywhere soon. Self-driving cars will scan for hazards in the street but will also pickup telltale signs of an informant: nervous twitches, too-enthusiastic slang. A customer might even be asked to answer a question like, \u201cAre you a cop?\u201d (Because, as all drug dealers know, a real cop has to say yes, even to an A.I.) It is likely that a database of narcs will be compiled, and inevitably, this database of narcs will be hacked. Millions of Americans will be exposed as poseurs \u2014 a social problem tragically immune to disruption.Jamie Lauren Keiles is a writer in New York.In the coming world of ubiquitous self-driving, it will just be you, the open road and the vast apparatus of the nanny state. Cars won\u2019t readily violate traffic laws and may well be legally required to report on their owners. Ignore that burned-out headlight for too long, and the overnight software update may include a virtual boot.Traffic tickets bring in billions of dollars annually, so all those well-behaved cars will have an economic impact. Governments that have historically viewed traffic citations as an extractive industry (Ferguson, Mo., say, or the State of California) will have no choice but to find alternatives. Far more consequential, for both the police and their communities, will be the death of the routine traffic stop. The Supreme Court has ruled that law enforcement may stop any car, whatever its true motive, as long as an infraction is observed. Human drivers can\u2019t get far without breaking the letter of the traffic law, so the pretexts come easy. If officers then spot a dozen laptops stacked on the back seat, they can ask questions. Yet this broad, virtually unchecked power to stop has led to charges of racial profiling. (A recent linguistic analysis of bodycam footage from Oakland, Calif., for example, concluded that officers spoke \u201cwith consistently less respect toward black versus white community members.\u201d) With pretexts largely automated away, these kinds of interactions will be rare. \u201cThe self-driving car,\u201d says Elizabeth Joh, a professor at the U.C. Davis School of Law, \u201cwill come to be seen as a civil rights issue.\u201dThe police will have lost an important investigative tool, but the government will have gained new surveillance possibilities. Cars will sweep up vast amounts of data about their surroundings and their occupants, including 24/7 GPS trails. (An important Fourth Amendment case being heard this fall, Carpenter v. United States, will decide whether the government needs a warrant to gain access to cellphone locational data, setting a precedent that could apply to cars.)Another potential target is the pedestrian. In the first part of the 20th century, manufacturers lobbied to make \u201cjaywalking\u201d a crime, so the new horseless carriages could cruise along urban streets relatively unimpeded. The pedestrians of the future, emboldened by the fact that self-driving cars are sure to stop, could cause havoc. No worries, though: Facial-recognition technology is coming along nicely, and the automotive industry will be, if anything, even more powerful. Look for today\u2019s complaints about speeding tickets to be replaced by stories of \u201cjaywalking traps\u201d and pitiless fines for a second offense.Looking back at the decades when the autonomous car was developed, you may find it hard to believe that its engineers imagined that it would stay landbound. All along, sea levels continued to rise, gradually overwhelming the sea walls that many coastal cities built as protection and flooding the (now absurdly named) ground floor of apartment and office buildings.Rather than simply abandon these buildings, though, many residents chose to stay \u2014 fueling a demand for autonomous aquacars and, as that technology improved, for mobile aquahomes. This became especially true after the successful completion of the SeaOrbiter, a floating laboratory originally designed for oceanography research. Elegant and semisubmersible, the SeaOrbiter acted as a kind of prototype for local offshore living \u2014 and the rise of aerial drone delivery, originally pioneered by Amazon, made the challenge of resupplying straightforward.Unfortunately, hackers quickly figured out how to hijack the aquahomes\u2019 navigation system \u2014 first by disabling it and then with programs that directed vessels to floating \u201cchop shops\u201d run by roving gangs of ship-breakers. Piracy rates dropped only after huge kelp growth, driven by a mix of ocean warming and overfishing, rendered the submerged communities as unnavigable by aquacars as they had been by roadbound ones.The animals most imperiled by cars are top predators like the Florida panther. Vehicles are responsible for 59 percent of all known panther deaths recorded in the state since 1981; just last year, a record-breaking 34 panthers \u2014 about one-fourth of the estimated population \u2014 were killed on the state\u2019s roads. Most panthers are struck at night, when human vision is particularly poor, but long-distance infrared cameras can pick up a warmblooded feline body in the dark, far beyond the range of headlights. Panthers able to cross roads safely could spread out of the cramped confines of Florida\u2019s southern tip, move north into the Okefenokee Swamp and then farther into Georgia on their way to eventually repopulating the Southeast.There is a concept in ecology called the trophic cascade, essentially the ripple effect on other animals when a top species vanishes. Over hundreds of years, humans methodically killed off predators like wolves, pumas and grizzly bears. Now, in many places, human drivers have become, albeit unintentionally, the top predator. Every year in the United States, there are an estimated 1.5 million deer-vehicle crashes. If self-driving cars manage to give deer safe passage, the fast-reproducing species would quickly grow beyond the ability of the vegetation to sustain them. \u201cYou\u2019d get a lot of starvation and mass die-offs,\u201d says Daniel J. Smith, a conservation biologist at the University of Central Florida who has been studying road ecology for nearly three decades. Species like raccoons and Virginia opossums will most likely see population explosions. \u201cThere will be deer in people\u2019s yards, and there will be snipers in towns killing them,\u201d Cramer says.This rewilding will be largely accidental, of course. Engineers will program cars to prioritize human life and property, making it far more likely they will stop for a moose than for a sparrow. Just how deferential they are toward wildlife will depend on human choices and ingenuity. For now, the heterogeneity and unpredictability of nature tends to confound the algorithms. In Australia, hopping kangaroos jumbled a self-driving Volvo\u2019s ability to measure distance. In Boston, autonomous-vehicle sensors identified a flock of sea gulls as a single form rather than a collection of individual birds. Still, even the tiniest creatures could benefit. \u201cThe car could know: \u2018O.K., this is a hot spot for frogs. It\u2019s spring. It\u2019s been raining. All the frogs will be moving across the road to find a mate,\u2019\u2009\u201d Smith says. The vehicles could reroute to avoid flattening amphibians on that critical day.But for that to happen, the people making and buying the cars would need to regard them and the roads not just as a mode of transport but also as part of a vast and intricate ecological web. So far, most humans don\u2019t seem particularly inclined to this kind of systems thinking. It is more likely that a surge in animal populations will be just another unintended consequence of a technological shift \u2014 much like social-media sites becoming platforms for publishing fake news or, for that matter, the internal-combustion engine contributing to the suffocation of the planet that might eventually wipe out humans and animals alike. We tend to get caught, ill prepared, in storms of our own making. If one thing seems certain about the autonomous car, it\u2019s that we will go full speed ahead with it, even if we haven\u2019t entirely thought through the consequences.Malia Wollan is the Tip columnist for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.I. Researchers Leave Elon Musk Lab to Begin Robotics Start-Up", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEMERYVILLE, Calif. \u2014 During a recent speech at the University of California, Berkeley, Pieter Abbeel played a video clip of a robot doing housework.The trick was that an engineer was operating the robot from afar, dictating its every move. But as Mr. Abbeel explained, the video showed that robotic hardware was nimble enough to mimic complex human behavior. It just needed software that could guide the hardware \u2014 without the help of that engineer.\u201cThis is largely a computer science problem \u2014 an artificial intelligence problem,\u201d Mr. Abbeel said. \u201cWe have the hardware that can do the job.\u201dTheir start-up, Embodied Intelligence, is backed by $7 million in funding from the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Amplify Partners and other investors. The company will specialize in complex algorithms that allow machines to learn tasks on their own. Using these methods, existing robots could learn to, for example, install car parts that aren\u2019t quite like the parts they have installed in the past, sort through a bucket of random holiday gifts as they arrive at a warehouse, or perform other tasks that machines traditionally could not.\u201cWe now have teachable robots,\u201d Mr. Abbeel said during a recent interview at the new company\u2019s offices in Emeryville, Calif., just across the bay from San Francisco.Robots already automate some work inside factories and warehouses, such as moving boxes from place to place at Amazon\u2019s massive distribution centers. But companies must program these machines for each particular task, limiting their possible applications. The hope is that robots can master a much wider array of tasks by learning on their own.\u201cToday, every motion that an industrial robot makes is specified down to the millimeter,\u201d said Sunil Dhaliwal, the Amplify founder who led the firm\u2019s investment in Embodied Intelligence. \u201cBut most real problems can\u2019t be solved that way. You have to be able not just to tell the robot what to do, but to tell it how to learn.\u201dMuch like Google and labs at Brown and Northeastern University, Embodied Intelligence is also augmenting these methods with a wide range of other machine learning techniques. Most notably, the start-up is exploring what is called imitation learning, a way for machines to learn discrete tasks from human demonstrations.The company is using this method to teach a two-armed robot to pick up plastic pipes from a table. Donning virtual reality headsets and holding motion trackers in their hands, Mr. Abbeel and his colleagues will repeatedly demonstrate the task in a digital world that recreates what is in front of a robot. Then the machine can then learn from this digital data.\u201cWe collect data on what the human is doing,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cThen we can train the machine to imitate the human.\u201dThese and similar machine learning methods have only begun to bear fruit over the past few years, but many believe they will overhaul the field of robotics. It is telling that OpenAI, a pure research lab that opened its doors less than two years ago, has now lost two big names to more commercial pursuits.Poached away from OpenAI by Mr. Musk himself, the machine learning expert Andrej Karpathy is now the director of A.I. at Tesla, working to help autonomous cars get smarter faster. And Mr. Abbeel is launching Embodied Intelligence. \u201cAndrej is stepping out of the research mode and saying: \u2018I want to do this in practice,\u2019\u201d Mr. Abbeel explained. \u201cThat same thing goes for us.\u201dHe said he believed his new start-up can rapidly push its methods into manufacturing operations like the auto industry. Although robotics already handle many tasks inside such factories, there are many others they can\u2019t yet master. That is what Embodied Intelligence hopes to change.Some researchers question how much these machine learning techniques will ultimately improve robotics, believing they are overhyped among both researchers and the news media. \u201cMachine learning is being thrown at so many problems in robotics,\u201d said Robert Howe, a professor of robotics at Harvard University. \u201cAnd it produces just enough results that people can trumpet it.\u201dBut Mr. Abbeel is among the world\u2019s top researchers in his field, and his decision to start a own company is an indication that machine learning will continue to push robotics forward.\u201cIt is obvious that this is what you need to build flexible, agile robotics,\u201d said Geoff Hinton, a pioneer of machine learning.Follow Cade Metz on Twiiter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia Powers Up the World\u2019s Biggest Battery \u2014 Courtesy of Elon Musk", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byADELAIDE, Australia \u2014 The state of South Australia announced on Friday that it had powered up the world\u2019s biggest battery ahead of schedule: a feat already being heralded as one of this century\u2019s first great engineering marvels and a potential solution to the country\u2019s energy woes.The battery is the size of an American football field. It is capable of powering 30,000 homes, and its rapid deployment reflects the union of a blackout-prone state and a flashy entrepreneur, Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla Motors, who pledged to complete its construction in 100 days or do it for free.\u201cThis is history in the making,\u201d said Jay Weatherill, the premier of South Australia. In a statement, Tesla said the completed battery \u201cshows that a sustainable, effective energy solution is possible.\u201dDebate over the battery\u2019s potential has become intense. Federal lawmakers who favor fossil fuels argue that its impact is being exaggerated, while supporters gush that the state\u2019s embrace of Mr. Musk could change the future of energy in Australia \u2014 and the world.Regardless, experts say, the moment of disruption is here.And it all started with a tweet, read on a couch.Mr. Weatherill, a Labor Party politician who has tried to promote his state as a magnet for innovation since taking office in 2011, was at home on his sofa in March when his phone began lighting up.He was just days away from announcing a plan to deal with the power failures that had plagued his state for years.On his phone came Twitter notification after Twitter notification with news that would upend his plan: Mr. Musk had offered to build the most powerful battery ever made, and do it faster than ever imagined.Recalling that moment, Mr. Weatherill said he started to sweat. If he embraced Mr. Musk\u2019s proposal, would it look like a billionaire American entrepreneur was strong-arming his state into redefining its energy policy? Was Mr. Musk\u2019s offer real, or merely a publicity stunt?When Mr. Musk was asked by the Australian entrepreneur (and fellow billionaire) Mike Cannon-Brookes \u201chow serious\u201d he was about his offer, the American mogul doubled down.\u201cTesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free,\u201d Mr. Musk tweeted. \u201cThat serious enough for you?\u201dFor Mr. Weatherill, the project has been a repudiation of a federal policy that de-emphasizes renewable energy. For Mr. Musk, the battery has been a headline-grabbing venture that could prove that his radical vision of the world\u2019s energy future is both functional and economical.South Australia has the highest electricity prices in the world. This imbalance of supply and demand has resulted in regular blackouts and astronomical bills for the state\u2019s 1.7 million residents.The high-capacity Tesla battery does not create energy, it just stores it. The state already invests in wind and solar energy. The battery would give it a bank of saved energy, which could ease pressure during periods of high demand and help better manage the electrical grid.\u201cMore than 40 percent of South Australia\u2019s electricity is coming from wind, which is good,\u201d said Tony Wood, an energy director at the Grattan Institute, a think tank. \u201cBut the consideration of how to integrate it \u2014 and manage that intermittency \u2014 wasn\u2019t so good.\u201dThe day after Mr. Weatherill was roused from his couch in March, he and Mr. Musk spoke on the phone about the proposal. The Australian, knowing the tech mogul\u2019s ability to stir the news media, had one demand: If Tesla were to win the contract, Mr. Musk would appear in South Australia to announce it to the world.\u201cHe usually doesn\u2019t come for announcements of winning a tender,\u201d Mr. Weatherill said, \u201cbut he said he\u2019d come.\u201dMr. Musk nearly broke his promise, after a rocket launch by his company SpaceX was delayed. But in September, Mr. Musk arrived in Adelaide to announce the $50 million deal and to start the 100-day countdown to the project\u2019s completion.\u201cWhat this serves as is a great example to the rest of the world of what can be done,\u201d Mr. Musk said at the time, adding that half the battery had already been finished.Mr. Musk declined to be interviewed for this article.In March, when Mr. Musk first presented his proposal, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull spoke with the entrepreneur and tweeted enthusiastically about its potential.Months later, when Tesla and the French renewables company Neoen were awarded the contract, however, Mr. Turnbull\u2019s Liberal Party government assailed the battery project and continued its attack on South Australia\u2019s energy policy.\u201c30,000 South Australian households could not get through watching one episode of \u2018Australia\u2019s Ninja Warrior\u2019 with this big battery,\u201d said Scott Morrison, the country\u2019s treasurer.Mr. Turnbull\u2019s government has promoted fossil fuels over renewable energy to stimulate growth and prevent South Australia\u2019s power shortages. The government has questioned the battery\u2019s capacity, implied the state has been hoodwinked by a clever salesman and suggested that Mr. Weatherill was looking for publicity ahead of a 2018 election.\u201cThe Tesla battery has been sold to the people of South Australia as an answer to their woes,\u201d Josh Frydenberg, the energy minister, wrote in an email. \u201cBut in reality it is just a fraction of the storage and backup that South Australia needs.\u201dFranck Woitiez, the general manager of Neoen\u2019s Australia division, which will operate the battery from its wind farm, said the Turnbull government was out of touch with the future of renewable energy.\u201cThere\u2019s no turning back,\u201d said Mr. Woitiez. \u201cIt\u2019s not tomorrow, it\u2019s now.\u201dThe next several weeks, the beginning of Australia\u2019s summer, will be crucial for judging the battery\u2019s success.\u201cSummer is when Australia gets its peak demand,\u201d said Mr. Wood, the energy researcher. \u201cIt will be a very important and high-profile demonstration in the role that batteries can play.\u201dBut some experts said the stakes would be even higher for Mr. Musk. He could shop the idea globally \u2014 if it works.\u201cHe needs these battery packs to really become effective,\u201d said Mr. Vance, Musk\u2019s biographer. \u201cHe needs this to justify the entire reason of Tesla\u2019s existence.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tax Bill\u2019s Fine Print: Tuition, Medical Expenses and Alimony", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn any tax bill as big as the one released on Thursday, all sorts of proposals slip in that few people were expecting. Once they emerge, however, they can make a big difference in the financial lives of people who find themselves in particular categories or sets of circumstances.What follow are several nuggets that won\u2019t get the headlines but that we found notable. Keep in mind that today\u2019s bill is a mere blueprint for negotiation and that some of these proposals will probably not come to pass. Nevertheless, if you will end up taking a hit if any of these items become law, now is a good time to call your elected representatives in Washington and raise your voice.Now Coverdells are in jeopardy again. The bill would prohibit new contributions (not including rollovers) after this year, though you could move your money from a Coverdell to a 529. And those who have the wherewithal to save for both K-12 and college expenses could take up to $10,000 out of a 529 plan each year to pay for those elementary and high school costs.The bill would make it harder for people who bought and flipped homes for a profit to qualify for tax breaks, starting next year.The tax break would begin to phase out for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeded $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers).At the moment, when employers pay your tuition for continuing education, the amount they pay is not taxable income for you as long as it meets certain conditions and amounts to no more than $5,250 per year. If the tax bill passes as written, these tuition payments will count as taxable income starting in 2018.Families seeking to adopt a child would lose on two fronts if the bill became law. First, if an employer provides financial assistance to a worker adopting a child, that money would be taxed as income starting next year. In 2017, when an employer pays for up to $13,570 in qualified adoption expenses for an employee, the employee pays no taxes on that assistance.Taxpayers who itemize their returns would no longer be able to deduct the amount that their tax preparation specialist billed them or any similar expenses. Since the tax bill aims to reduce the number of taxpayers who itemize, in theory fewer people should require professional tax help (with the exception of wealthier people, who can afford to lose this break).Know more about these provisions, how they got into the bill and what may happen next?

{"Headline": "How Could a Tax Change Affect You? This Is What the Senate and House Propose", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat\u2019s in place now:What the House proposed:What the Senate proposed:Seven brackets, with a top rate of 38.5 percent that you pay on income beyond $1 million annually if you\u2019re married or $500,000 if you\u2019re single. The Senate bill\u2019s lowest tax bracket is at 10 percent for individuals, while the House bill had raised it to 12 percent.What\u2019s in place now:If you\u2019re single, the current standard deduction is $6,350. Add in exemptions and you\u2019re up to $10,400.Married without children? That\u2019s $12,700 for the deduction and $20,700 with exemptions.If you\u2019re married with two kids, the deduction-plus-exemptions figure goes up to $28,700. There is also a $1,000 tax credit per child.What the House proposed:The House bill calls for simplification: If you\u2019re single with no children, your standard deduction would be $12,000. If you\u2019re married, it would be $24,000 no matter how many kids you have. The child tax credit, however, would rise to $1,600 per child. There is also an additional $300 credit for each parent and nonchild dependent, though that would expire after 2022.What the Senate proposed:The same $12,000/$24,000 standard deductions as the House. Single parents would see their deductions go to $18,000 from $9,300. The child tax credit would rise to $1,650.What\u2019s in place now:What the House proposed:No more state and local tax deductions, though you could continue to deduct up to $10,000 each year in property tax. For people buying in the future (which the bill defines as Nov. 2, 2017, or later), mortgage interest deductions would be allowed only on loans up to $500,000. Moreover, only debt from primary residences would count toward that limit, and you could not include any interest from home equity loans or lines of credit that you took out on that new home.What the Senate proposed:No more state and local tax deductions and no exception for property taxes, either. The mortgage interest deduction, however, would survive in its current form.What\u2019s in place now:What the House proposed:The House wants to do away with the deduction in 2018.What the Senate proposed:The Senate would keep the deduction.What\u2019s in place now:What the House proposed:The House wants to do away with the student loan interest deduction.What the Senate proposed:The Senate would keep things as they are now.What\u2019s in place now:In general, you pay taxes on inherited property at a 40 percent rate, but current rules waive that tax for estates up to $5,490,000.What the House proposed:The House seeks to nearly double that exemption and repeal it altogether after 2024 \u2014 a year later than the House first proposed.What the Senate proposed:The Senate wishes to double the exemption but has not proposed any full repeal.What\u2019s in place now:People who own small businesses of various sorts generally pay income taxes based on the normal rate for individual taxes. Often, they are involved in or run partnerships, sole proprietorships, limited liability companies and S corporations.What the House proposed:What the Senate proposed:What\u2019s in place now:What the House proposed:The bill had proposed getting rid of the adoption credit altogether, but on Thursday afternoon, the Republican leadership changed its mind and left it intact.What the Senate proposed:The Senate would also leave it intact.What\u2019s in place now:What the House proposed:Taxpayers would need to have lived in the home for five out of the previous eight years \u2014 and the tax break could be used only once every five years, down from once every two years. The tax break would begin to phase out for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeded $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers).What the Senate proposed:The Senate proposes an identical formula as it relates to years in residence and frequency of use. But it allows people who fail to meet the five-year requirement because of a change in employment, health trouble or \u201cunforeseen circumstances\u201d to exclude a fraction of the $250,000 or $500,000 equal to the fraction of the five-year period that they were in residence.What\u2019s in place now:What the House proposed:What the Senate proposed:The Senate did not propose any changes.What\u2019s in place now:What the House proposed:The House did away with these so-called \u201ccasualty\u201d deductions. That means you would be out of luck, unless legislators passed a one-time bill offering relief for victims of particular weather or other events that affected a lot of people.What the Senate proposed:Starting in 2018, you could only claim a deduction if the loss happened during an event that the president later officially declared to be a disaster.What\u2019s in place now:Alimony is a deductible expense for people paying it, and those who receive it must pay income taxes.What the House proposed:What the Senate proposed:The Senate bill would make no changes to alimony rules.What\u2019s in place now:As it stands, taxpayers can deduct moving expenses \u2014 even if they do not itemize their tax returns \u2014 as long as the new workplace is at least 50 miles farther from the old home than the old job location was from the old home. (If you had no workplace, the new job must be at least 50 miles from your old home.)What the House proposed:Relocating for a new job? Moving costs would no longer be a deductible expense in 2018.What the Senate proposed:The Senate\u2019s bill is similar to the House\u2019s, though it allows some exceptions for members of the military.What\u2019s in place now:You can usually deduct the amount your tax preparation specialist billed you or any similar tax-related expenses, like software you purchase and the fee you pay to file your forms electronically.What the House proposed:Taxpayers would no longer be able to take this deduction. Since the bill aims to reduce the number of taxpayers who itemize (and all the complexity that goes with that), in theory fewer people should require professional tax help (with the exception of wealthier people, who can afford to lose this break).What the Senate proposed:The Senate\u2019s proposal is similar to that of the House.What\u2019s in place now:What the House proposed:The House would do away with the credit.What the Senate proposed:The Senate proposed no change.What\u2019s in place now:You can exclude up to $20 each month from your income for expenses related to regular bicycle commuting, as long as you are not receiving other pretax commuting benefits from your employer.What the House proposed:The House bill did not propose any changes.What the Senate proposed:The Senate would take away this tax break.What\u2019s in place now:Employees of educational institutions who receive reduced tuition \u2014 or a waiver \u2014 for themselves, spouses or dependents are generally not taxed on that income. This is particularly helpful for certain graduate students; their tuition is waived as part of arrangements in which they teach or perform research at their university.What the House proposed:The House bill would treat reduced or waived tuition as income.What the Senate proposed:The Senate would keep things as they are now.At the moment, when employers pay your tuition for continuing education, the amount they pay is not taxable income for you as long as it meets certain conditions and amounts to no more than $5,250 per year.What the House proposed:The House would make these tuition payments count as taxable income starting in 2018.What the Senate proposed:The Senate would keep things as they are now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A World War II \u2018Dirty Dozen\u2019 Watch Brand Is Back", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 It may not seem entirely rational to introduce a watch brand in today\u2019s highly competitive market, but Don Cochrane is not a man driven by reason.Mr. Cochrane never knew his great-grandfather, but he was close to his grandparents Henry and Peggy Lazarus (she was Mr. Lyons\u2019s daughter). \u201cMy grandfather had been in the business since 1938, and we used to draw watches together,\u201d he said, adding with a laugh, \u201cThough obviously as a child drawing a circle and putting hands on it is pretty straightforward.\u201dTwo years ago, when his grandmother died about six months short of her 100th birthday, he had the idea to revive the brand.\u201cI was at work, thinking about my grandmother\u2019s life and Vertex,\u201d recalled Mr. Cochrane, who has a background in advertising and previously worked for Tesla, VistaJet and Aston Martin. \u201cI Googled it and started learning all this really amazing stuff. It was a bit of an epiphany.\u201dVertex, he found, was one of the \u201cdirty dozen,\u201d the nickname that the watch community uses for the 12 companies that the British military leadership authorized to produce timepieces for World War II troops. At the time, the watches were called W.W.W. \u2014 for Watch, Wristlet, Waterproof \u2014 and some are highly collectible today, like the Omega, IWC and Jaeger-LeCoultre designs.Vertex was the only British brand in the group, although its movements were made in Switzerland.Mr. Cochrane said the narrative was perfect for a heritage watch brand \u2014 \u201cThese watches got beaten up and shot at,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were used to navigate across enemy territory, for when to drop bombs or block that bridge.\u201d \u2014 but he still felt he needed something that was, as he said, \u201cemotionally different.\u201dHe decided to build Vertex around a community, initially 60 people whom Mr. Cochrane personally invited to become Vertex owners. Forty-five accepted, and each was given five names to invite, growing the brand in turn. Sales are primarily limited to invitees, although anyone who owns one of the original W.W.W. Vertex models also can buy a new watch.\u201cSelling to retailers and customers is cool, but I think people want to feel more connected with brands now,\u201d Mr. Cochrane said. \u201cI know all of our owners, and they\u2019re involved with the brand in some shape or form.\u201d He also envisions holding events, like the one scheduled in New York this week, where owners and potential owners can meet and see the watch.When Mr. Cochrane actually began working on the revival in mid-2015, his first step was to buy back the Vertex trademark \u2014 it had become the property of Columbia, the outdoor clothing and sportswear company \u2014 and, after remortgaging his house and borrowing from family members, he then set out to find Swiss partners. Eventually, he selected Roventa Henex to make the watches, and that company decided to use movements from ETA, the Swatch Group subsidiary.As for the inaugural design, the steel Vertex M100 is true to its \u201cdirty dozen\u201d predecessor, including the dial\u2019s pheon, or broad arrow, a heraldic symbol used on all sorts of British government items from uniforms to ornaments. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be on the watch,\u201d Mr. Cochrane said, adding that the government no longer used the emblem. \u201cBut it was important to have that continuation.\u201dThe most notable differences are that the new case is 40 millimeters (the original was 35 millimeters) and the dial numbers are molded from SuperLuminova for easy reading in the dark. The watch also features an ETA 7001 movement, water resistance to a depth of more than 325 feet, a 42-hour power reserve and delivery in a Pelican box, the industrial-grade, foam-packed case beloved by the military and film crews. It comes with two straps, black leather and gray NATO, and is priced at 2,500 pounds ($3,320).Only 600 watches have been made, and more than 200 have sold since the M100 became available in May. \u201cWhen they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone \u2014 and that will pay for the next watch,\u201d said Mr. Cochrane, who hinted at the appearance of a dive or dress watch next summer.The M100\u2019s owners include collectors as well as engineers, entrepreneurs, musicians, athletes, the designer behind all of Pink Floyd\u2019s album art and a Victoria\u2019s Secret model.One is the Earl of Mornington, who was a host of Vertex\u2019s inaugural event in London in March. He said he was intrigued by Mr. Cochrane\u2019s family connection to the brand and the \u201cunusual sequence of events that led to it being on my wrist.\u201dMr. Cochrane said the comments made him \u201cannoyed and sad,\u201d and he countered with examples of top-end watches that are accessible only by the ultrarich. \u201cI think money is elitist,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have lots of it, you can have whatever you want.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Car Did \u2014 And What It Might Do", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "As the car transformed the American lifestyle, so did it colonize the American imagination. Perhaps the most fascinating artifact of automotive retrofuturism dates to 1958, two years into the Interstate building boom, when Disney produced an hourlong TV program called \u201cMagic Highway, U.S.A.\u201d After a half-hour or so celebrating the car\u2019s ascent, the program pivoted to envisioning its future. At a time when Eisenhower\u2019s Interstate project \u2014 inspired, famously, by his awe at traveling Hitler\u2019s autobahn during the Nazi overthrow \u2014 was seizing private property through eminent domain around the country, Disney imagined atomic-powered tunnel borers and imperial road-building machines as tall and wide as skyscrapers, cutting through landscapes and leaving fully constructed roadways in their wake. Dreaming further forward, the program extrapolated from the new real-world highways to envision literal high-ways of clear tubes raised far above the urban environment, magnificent air-conditioned arteries that someday would \u201clink together all nations and help create a better understanding among the peoples of the world.\u201dSome of Disney\u2019s imagined future has indeed become our present, from rear-facing cameras to automated GPS-style directions. But the program\u2019s writers and illustrators would no doubt have been shocked to learn that in 2017, nearly 60 years into the glorious automotive future, the physical highways we drive on would be functionally identical (probably inferior, in fact, after decades of neglect and disrepair) to those outside their office windows. Perhaps the most succinct explanation for why Disney did not get its future highways is that Eisenhower got his. The realization of the Interstate System wound up spanning three and a half decades and consuming hundreds of billions of dollars in construction costs, an unparalleled, concentrated investment of financial and political capital that ensured any new transportation innovations for decades would need to be designed to exploit it. Like so many sci-fi dreamers, Disney\u2019s writers tried to think of the perfect transportation system, but in real life, the good-enough \u2014 the version of a technology that a society actually finds, in a concrete historical moment, the money and political will to enact \u2014 often winds up being the enemy of the perfect.More perversely still, the suburban lifestyle that the Interstates enabled also gave rise to an atomized, individualistic politics, which soon bred a revolt against the taxation and central planning that made their construction possible in the first place. Disney\u2019s writers saw a new infrastructural grandeur around them and imagined it would spark more grandeur, but in fact the highway boom proved to be a self-negating act of imagination, like one of those \u201cuseless machines\u201d that sends out a mechanical hand to turn itself off.Instead, as the dismal cycle of road-building and sprawl has continued, the last half century of automotive technology has brought mostly defensive advances \u2014 innovations that add no excitement to the car but merely ameliorate one or more of its truly terrible qualities. Airbags reduced its fatality rate, while federal emissions standards beat back smog. Hybrid and electric drivetrains have allowed some consumers to pay for the pleasure of offsetting, ever so slightly, the upward trajectory of the carbon emissions that will one day render Earth uninhabitable. Looming awareness of climate change has rendered grimly absurd that other great id\u00e9e fixe of automotive futurism, the flying car: The basic mathematics of raising a ton of metal into the air, even if done electrically, are disastrous in a world where the plurality of electricity will be generated with fossil fuels for the foreseeable future. Sci-fi horizons thus foreclosed to them, automakers have poured much of their design energies into weird personalization features (the driver\u2019s seat remembers who you are!) or better integration between stereos and smartphones (never miss a podcast!). After a century in which the car radically remapped American society, creativity about its own future got stuck in a cul-de-sac.But now, the car has been steered once again toward a fantastical sci-fi destination. The dream of cars that drive themselves has been around almost as long as cars have \u2014 Americans saw a concept for some at the 1939 World\u2019s Fair, and another, more far-fetched one in \u201cMagic Highway, U.S.A.\u201d \u2014 but the push to make it real began a little over a decade ago, powered by academic roboticists and funded by the U.S. military. In 2004, Darpa inaugurated its \u201cGrand Challenge,\u201d offering a $1 million prize to an autonomous vehicle that could navigate a 142-mile course; no team\u2019s robot was able to finish that first year, but the following year, five did, with first prize going to Stanford\u2019s team. Google made the dream significantly more real beginning in 2009, when it began pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the concept.In the past five years, the headlong push toward self-driving technology has swept up not just Google\u2019s tech rivals (chief among them Uber, with which Google has become embroiled in a bitter and costly intellectual-property lawsuit) but the world\u2019s automakers as well. Tesla, Cadillac, Volvo, Audi and Nissan have already rolled out models with autonomous modes for highway driving, akin to cruise controls that can also steer and brake; next year, more brands and models will join their ranks. Most of the major automakers say they expect fully autonomous vehicles to be available 15 years from now, and quite a few of them are backing that prediction with enormous capital, from GM\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of a self-driving start-up, Cruise Automation, to Ford\u2019s equally large investment in an A.I. start-up called Argo. Folly or not, self-driving cars are the future that nearly every major car company thinks it has to bet on.For this installment of our annual Tech and Design Issue, we\u2019ve devoted the entire magazine, front to back, to the question of autonomous cars and the future they could usher in. That level of attention seems warranted, given how profoundly this technology could change the way we live, with first- and second- and third-order effects that boggle the mind. We\u2019ve visited with automakers in Detroit and in Silicon Valley to take the measure of their self-driving schemes. But we\u2019ve also indulged in some sci-fi speculation of our own, trying to imagine what would happen if this unprecedented engine of American society \u2014 the machine that, more than any other, for better or worse, has given shape to American life for a century \u2014 really does undergo this radical transformation. The consequences would touch crime and punishment, work and leisure, exercise and partying and sex. Over the next century, they may well alter the built environment as radically as the manually driven car did over the last century.As much as possible, we\u2019ve tried to avoid the trap of extrapolating the future solely from the technology while assuming the society that we currently have. When the automobile came to cities a century ago, the norm was that pedestrians and carriages shared the streets equally, and it would have made sense to imagine that practice would continue. But soon the automotive interests grew powerful enough to seize the streets for themselves \u2014 resulting in the literal invention of a crime, called jaywalking \u2014 and then to displace the arguably superior technology of streetcars. Likewise, self-driving cars will create new power centers, new crimes, just as they will create new counterpowers, new forms of rebellion. Die-hard drivers might not relinquish their steering wheels easily. Industries gored by self-driving technology (Who needs motels if your car has a bed? What happens to gas stations when cars can drive themselves to charging ports?) might flex political muscle to check its progress. Law enforcement might stoke fears of autonomous getaway cars or self-driving terrorism to do the same.Indeed, it\u2019s a set of basic human questions, far more than technology, that will really determine the future of the car. Can cars decouple from their history as a status symbol? Will millennial attitudes on car ownership entrench and deepen, to the point that car-sharing becomes a real cultural norm, or will that generation revert to the American mean as it ages? Will the push to kill the steering wheel look like a new freedom, to be met with excitement, or like a new prohibition, to be met with reactionary backlash? Will we muster the political will to push back on corporate power, as autonomous cars create new quasi-monopolistic giants? Or could autonomous cars actually arrive into a totally different economic and political order, one that they help to bring about? After all, Disney couldn\u2019t have foreseen, in 1958, the political realities of today that would make their imagined future impossible \u2014 realities that the highway itself helped create. The political and social convulsions of the next 50 years will be the real driver of our high-tech future. It\u2019s fun to guess at the ending of that unwritten history, but in truth we don\u2019t entirely know yet how it will begin.Bill Wasik is a deputy editor of the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China to Export Trumpchi Cars to U.S., Maybe With a New Name", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 The cars are called Trumpchi (though their Chinese maker insists the name is just a coincidence).Various models of Trumpchi cars have been motoring down Chinese roads for the past seven years. But even after the United States elected a real estate tycoon with a similar name as president, the world ignored them.Now the company that makes Trumpchis hopes that will change \u2014 and China appears to believe the rest of its auto industry is ready to go global, too.GAC Motor said on Friday that it would begin selling Trumpchis in the United States by the end of 2019. The company hopes it will be the first Chinese car brand to take off in a market that has eluded the country\u2019s manufacturers.Trumpchis have gained a devoted following in China. The brand\u2019s burly GS8 midsize sport utility vehicle, the first model that the company plans to sell in the United States, and its spacious new GM8 minivan have sleek lines and levels of fit and finish close to those of Japanese automakers.Top executives and their advisers are agonizing, however, over whether, and how, to change the name for the American market.\u201cThere\u2019s no Obama-mobile, that\u2019s a cultural thing, there\u2019s no Clinton car,\u201d said Robert C. Maling Jr., a retired Lexus executive who is now an adviser to GAC. \u201cIt would be confusing to the American public to have the Trumpchi name.\u201dThe Chinese government broadly appears to be gearing up for large-scale exports.But Beijing is now discussing slight reductions in those restrictions. It is largely to prevent foreign governments from citing them as a reason to apply their own limits on Chinese automotive exports.Unlike any other carmaking power, China requires multinationals to produce cars in 50-50 joint ventures with local companies, to help its domestic businesses learn the latest manufacturing techniques. But in statements over the past two weeks, the government has said that it may relax that rule somewhat for electric cars made in foreign trade zones.China also said right after President Trump left Beijing a week ago that it would consider a gradual cut in its import tariffs. China charges a 25 percent tax on imported cars, compared with 2.5 percent in the United States.A formula being considered would apply the 25 percent tariff only to imported components in each Tesla car, said one of these people, who insisted on anonymity because the discussions were continuing. That would cut Tesla\u2019s financial burden, while also putting heavy pressure on it to shift as much production as possible to Chinese suppliers.Tesla declined to comment, except to repeat that it is in talks to set up a factory to supply the Chinese market.Starting in 2013, Commerce Ministry officials have suggested they might lower China\u2019s own automotive trade barriers once Chinese manufacturers were ready to sell abroad, to prevent them from being used as justification by other countries for reciprocal trade barriers. Indeed, carmakers from China that export electric vehicles to the United States could even find advantages.Yu Jun, the president of GAC Motor, said in an interview on Friday that the company planned to export electric cars to the United States and Europe as well as gasoline-powered vehicles. If it does so, it could benefit from the United States\u2019 $7,500 tax credit for electric car buyers.Only the first 200,000 electric cars from each manufacturer qualify for the credit. Tesla and other American companies, like General Motors, are close to exhausting the credits for their customers. But GAC and other Chinese companies would each have the full 200,000 credits available.The tax credit\u2019s future, though, is uncertain. As Congress considers a tax overhaul, some lawmakers are considering eliminating it.Here in China, the government has barred people who buy Teslas from collecting subsidies of $10,000 or more per electric car because such benefits are available only to buyers of Chinese-built cars. The American tax credits, by contrast, can be used for imports.Despite the changing environment, GAC Group, GAC Motor\u2019s parent company, has a lot of marketing work to do before it enters the American market.At the Guangzhou auto show on Friday, Feng Xingya, the group\u2019s president, emphasized that GAC is a state-owned enterprise seeking to faithfully carry out the goals of the Chinese government. That message might not go over as well next year at the Detroit and Chicago auto shows, where the company plans to announce more details of its American sales offensive.And then there\u2019s the name. GAC officials, for their part, say Trumpchi sounds in Chinese a little like \u201cpassing on happiness.\u201d Any decision on whether to change the brand\u2019s name would be announced at the Detroit auto show in January, Mr. Yu said.Whatever it is called on arrival at American docks, Trumpchi may have the best shot of any Chinese competitor at international acceptance.The Chinese government has long been leery of letting its automakers start exporting, for fear that they might embarrass the country and damage their brands by having shoddy quality. But Trumpchi has done much better than most Chinese brands, and better than some multinational brands\u2019 China subsidiaries, in surveys of initial quality by J. D. Power and Associates, the global quality consulting company.Car dealers, however, may not be as concerned. \u201cI\u2019m not into the geopolitical nature of it,\u201d said Bob Shuman, a Detroit-area Chrysler dealer who attended Trumpchi\u2019s introduction of a new minivan in Guangzhou. \u201cI\u2019m just interested in selling cars.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Calls for Cutting Car Emissions by a Third. Not Enough, Critics Say.", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe proposals by the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, would force automakers to cut vehicle carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent by 2030 compared to 2021 levels, and to achieved half of the cuts by 2025.To the disappointment of environmental groups, the commission declined to set quotas for how many zero-emission electric vehicles carmakers must sell by 2030. Instead, the plan offers financial rewards to carmakers if they exceed certain benchmarks for electric-vehicle production.The emissions targets announced by the European Commission on Wednesday are \u201ca half-step into the future,\u201d Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen said. \u201cThey spared themselves the other half-step because they are afraid of the future.\u201dGerman car brands like Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche that emphasize big luxury cars have a harder time meeting tough carbon dioxide standards than companies like France\u2019s Renault or Italy\u2019s Fiat, which, in relative terms, sell more small cars.The European Commission acknowledged consulting car industry representatives as part of the normal legislative process, but denied abandoning quotas under pressure from the German government or industry lobbyists. Quotas were never under consideration, the commission press office said in a statement on Wednesday.\u201cAny claims that we ever aimed to introduce quotas for electric cars are simply untrue and have no foundation,\u201d the statement said.Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the top commission official responsible for climate action and energy, spoke by telephone on Friday with Matthias Wissmann, president of the German Association of the Auto Industry, a lobbying group, the commission said. Mr. Wissmann is a former German transportation minister with close ties to the German government.\u201cThe phone call took place as part of an inclusive, broader stakeholder engagement by the commission aimed at listening to the views of all interested parties,\u201d the commission press office said in its statement.Mr. Ca\u00f1ete said on Wednesday that the commission opposed quotas for electric vehicles because it did not think it should be choosing which technologies were best. \u201cInstead we let carmakers decide,\u201d he said at a news conference in Brussels.Mr. Wissmann also exchanged emails last month with Martin Selmayr, a top aide to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission\u2019s president. Copies of the emails, viewed by The New York Times, indicate that Mr. Wissmann got some, but not all, of what he sought.As Mr. Wissmann requested, the commission did not impose sanctions on carmakers that fall short of benchmarks for electric-vehicle production. But he failed to prevent the commission from establishing mandatory, interim goals for 2025.Those who support quotas said that setting such quotas would encourage suppliers and other companies to invest in electric-vehicle technology by ensuring that there would be a market.The plan also calls for Europe to spend 800 million euros, or $928 million, to build charging stations for electric vehicles, and \u20ac200 million to develop battery technologies.Volkswagen, which helped provoke the current debate by fraudulently concealing excess diesel emissions for a decade, is now trying to reposition itself as a leader in bringing electric cars to the mass market. The company was only mildly critical of the proposals, saying the European Union should do more to reduce emissions of the 250 million cars already on the road by, for example, promoting the use of synthetic fuels.In a statement, Volkswagen reiterated its goal of introducing 50 all-electric models by 2025 and called the proposed reductions in carbon dioxide emissions \u201cpositive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Hoellerbauer pushed a button on the steering wheel and took his hands away.\u201cWe are now autonomous,\u201d Williams announced.The car glided along Main Street to a four-way stop, waited for another car (driven by a researcher) to clear the intersection, then made a gentle right turn. Autonomous cars are programmed to drive conservatively, and any time our Fusion sensed an approaching object \u2014 like a Ford employee, role-playing an oblivious pedestrian \u2014 it slowed down until it was sure the path was clear, then proceeded cautiously. It felt like being chauffeured by an elderly ghost.Two minutes into the drive, the car pulled around a traffic circle and up to a blinking red light at an empty intersection. It stopped. A few seconds passed. Perhaps, I thought, it was just being characteristically risk-averse. Then a few more seconds passed, and the engineers started to look nervous. Williams squinted at his laptop.\u201cSo right now, we\u2019re not sure if the intersection is clear, so we\u2019re being very cautious,\u201d Williams said, speaking for the car. \u201cIt\u2019s expecting ...\u201d He trailed off and turned to Hoellerbauer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just overtake it?\u201d Hoellerbauer grabbed the wheel and tapped the gas pedal, overriding the self-driving system and manually steering us through the intersection.\u201cWe didn\u2019t see that happen this morning,\u201d Williams explained, by way of an apology. We took another lap around Mcity, and when we reached the intersection again, the car did the exact same thing.Self-driving cars raise the specter of horrific malfunctions \u2014 a code glitch that sends a car careering off a cliff, a remote hack that disables the brakes \u2014 but perfectly innocuous problems like the one we experienced will be far more common, and no less an impediment to road-readiness. There are dozens of autonomous vehicles being tested all over the world \u2014 43 companies are testing 295 different self-driving vehicles in California alone \u2014 and not one of them has a clean record. A self-driving Uber vehicle zoomed through a red light in San Francisco last year. The sensors on cars used by Waymo, the self-driving-car division of Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent, have struggled in heavy rain and snow. I\u2019ve had half a dozen self-driving-car experiences in my life, including a white-knuckle trip down Manhattan\u2019s West Side Highway in a Tesla Model X whose owner had set it to \u201cautopilot\u201d mode, and I wouldn\u2019t describe any of them as relaxing.How quickly these rides will improve depends on whom you ask. Silicon Valley futurists, in typically sanguine fashion, predict that we are months, not years, away from a Cambrian explosion of autonomous cars. Waymo has a pilot program for its self-driving vehicles already underway in Arizona and says it\u2019s \u201creally close\u201d to being fully operational. Lyft, which has partnered with a start-up called Drive.ai, is aiming to have a fleet of self-driving cars operating in the Bay Area by the end of the year. And Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, which has offered semiautonomous features since 2015, has suggested that its cars could be fully autonomous as soon as 2019.But that\u2019s California, where optimism is the coin of the realm. In Detroit, the timeline looks slower and more incremental. Ford, in particular, believes that the first generation of driverless cars will be limited, capable of traveling only in commercial fleets inside carefully plotted urban areas. Other cars will simply get smarter without being autonomous, with features like collision prevention and self-parking becoming more common. Self-driving technology will eventually be more sophisticated and will one day be capable of full door-to-door autonomy in every possible area and condition, but as Ford sees it, that\u2019s not going to happen overnight, or even very soon.Despite its pragmatic restraint, Ford has invested hundreds of millions in self-driving cars and is making surprising progress. In a report earlier this year, Navigant Research placed Ford at the top of its leader board, ahead of tech companies like Waymo and Uber as well as auto rivals like GM and Toyota, based on Ford\u2019s advanced manufacturing capabilities coupled with its strides in software development. The report generated headlines like, \u201cDetroit Is Kicking Silicon Valley\u2019s Ass in the Race to Build Self-Driving Cars,\u201d and delivered a morale boost to Ford, which showed up late but finally felt as if it had a chance.Ford\u2019s big, blinking target is 2021 \u2014 the year it hopes to release a vehicle that meets the Society of Automotive Engineers International\u2019s definition of Level 4 autonomy (no human operator required in the area and conditions it\u2019s programmed for). It\u2019s a tough deadline for a company whose culture might be the exact opposite of Silicon Valley\u2019s, where companies release half-finished \u201cminimum viable products\u201d and abide by maxims like \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d Before Ford \u2014 or any conventional automaker \u2014 produces anything, each part has to pass a grueling battery of tests and certifications. There is a reason \u201cautomotive grade\u201d has become a synonym for \u201creliable.\u201d \u201cOur vehicles have to be a trusted product,\u201d Chris Brewer, Ford\u2019s chief engineer for autonomous vehicles, told me. \u201cThat is a little more important than \u2018Did my phone freeze or not?\u2019\u2009\u201dAmericans are wary of driverless cars \u2014 56 percent, according to the Pew Research Center, would prefer not to ride in one \u2014 and when I talked to Brewer, it occurred to me that some part of that hesitation might stem from who we assume will be producing them: Silicon Valley tech giants, the same stateless behemoths that have spent the last few decades barging into old-line industries like the Kool-Aid Man, destroying working-class jobs and leaving behind cold, modern efficiency. But maybe these skeptics could be persuaded to trust Detroit. After all, Brewer is right \u2014 self-driving cars aren\u2019t smartphones. They\u2019re two-ton projectiles that take your parents to the grocery store and your kids to soccer practice, that will need to make billions of computational decisions per second while moving at 65 miles per hour, that contain within them the power to extinguish human life. You kind of want them to take a while.Leading Ford into this weird new era is Jim Hackett, who was named chief executive in May. Hackett, 62, is an oddity by Detroit standards. A design-minded aesthete in an industry dominated by gearheads and number crunchers, he spent two decades running Steelcase, a Michigan-based office-furniture company whose designers are often credited with \u2014 or blamed for \u2014 popularizing the open-plan office trend.At a conference several years ago, Hackett struck up a conversation with Ford\u2019s executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., who goes by Bill. He is the great-grandson of Henry Ford, and another auto-world misfit \u2014 an outspoken environmentalist who once ruffled feathers at Ford by speaking at a Greenpeace event. The two bonded over their shared vision of \u201csmart mobility,\u201d a fuzzy term, more common among urbanists than businesspeople, for creating a sort of harmony among land use, technology and transportation of all forms. Hackett joined Ford\u2019s board of directors in 2013. In 2016, Bill Ford persuaded Hackett to lead Ford\u2019s newly created smart-mobility unit, and about a year later, he tapped him to run the entire company.Hackett\u2019s jockish C.V. \u2014 he played football at Michigan and briefly ran the school\u2019s athletic department \u2014 masks his high-minded streak, which can make talking to him feel like taking a college philosophy seminar after a few bong rips. In the early 2000s, he began traveling to the Santa Fe Institute, a research group started by prominent scientists who wanted to study \u201ccomplex adaptive systems\u201d \u2014 a branch of theoretical physics that imagines the world as a series of complicated networks that are governed by universal laws and patterns, the same way biology is guided by Darwinian evolution. The rules that explained how anthills formed, they believed, might also explain urbanization trends in Southeast Asia or predict economic cycles. It was a formative experience for Hackett, who began to believe that businesses were governed by universal laws, too.Hackett also became obsessed with \u201cdesign thinking,\u201d a new-agey management philosophy that has become trendy in recent years. Adherents believe that instead of optimizing for profit, organizations should put human emotion at the center of every strategy decision and begin by empathizing with their customers. \u201cNo technology ever evolves without the human interpreting and altering it,\u201d Hackett says. \u201cEvery new technology, the science and the engineering of it, has to give way to human understanding and use.\u201dHackett is only six months into the chief-executive job, but his mannerisms have already entered Ford\u2019s bloodstream. I arrived in Dearborn expecting to talk about drivetrains and crankshafts, but in a series of interviews with nearly a dozen executives, barely anyone mentioned cars or trucks at all. Instead, I heard the Ford Motor Company described as a \u201cmobility solutions provider\u201d that engages in \u201cmultimodal journey planning.\u201d People spoke about \u201cwhiteboarding\u201d and \u201cblue-skying\u201d big ideas. I watched a video that described Ford\u2019s efforts to build a \u201cholistic, organic, interconnected system powered by a transportation operating system.\u201dIt is bizarre to watch an all-American manufacturing company get brain-snatched like this. Even the company\u2019s new internal mission statement bears Hackett\u2019s woolly imprint: \u201cTo become the world\u2019s most trusted mobility company by designing smart vehicles for a smart world.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly \u201cBuilt Ford Tough.\u201d But it\u2019s very much in keeping with Hackett\u2019s worldview, in which everything exists in connection with everything else, and changing one piece of a system necessarily changes the whole. A car learns to drive itself, and a city\u2019s transportation grid shifts around it.This kind of big-picture futurism is necessary in Detroit today, where automakers are frantically reinventing themselves to stay ahead of what they fear might be coming. The average personal vehicle is driven less than an hour per day. But self-driving cars can, in theory, pick up and drop off passengers all day, which significantly reduces the number of cars a community needs. (Researchers at the University of Michigan estimate that autonomous vehicles could cause car ownership to drop by as much as 43 percent. Lyft, which has a horse in the race, cites research estimating that as many as 80 percent of cars could eventually be eliminated.) And because much of the value of self-driving cars lies in the software that runs them, companies that make only hardware \u2014 known in the business as \u201coriginal equipment manufacturers,\u201d or O.E.M.s \u2014 are likely to be squeezed, or worse.Faced with visions of a bleak future as low-margin widget-builders for Silicon Valley, automakers have spent the past several years trying to catch up. General Motors spent $581 million to buy Cruise Automation, a self-driving-technology start-up. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles struck a deal with Waymo, in addition to partnering with BMW and Intel. Daimler and Volvo each joined with Uber, and Toyota set up a whole research institute in Silicon Valley to build its own self-driving vehicles.Ford\u2019s plans might be the most ambitious. It wants to have a hand in every part of the self-driving-car industry, including the software that replaces the human driver, the platform that connects and controls the cars and the services that spring up around them. To that end, Ford has spent the past several years quietly snapping up tech talent. It struck a partnership with Lyft and acquired Chariot, a San Francisco-based start-up that runs group shuttles for commuters. It set up an office in Palo Alto that now has 205 employees and created Greenfield Labs, a business incubator. It invested in Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based artificial-intelligence start-up, and several other companies, including Velodyne, which makes Lidar sensors, and a connected-car software outfit called Autonomic.Most industry observers believe these are the right moves for Ford to be making. But it\u2019s still tough to reconcile today\u2019s Ford \u2014 which makes money by selling millions of combustion-engine trucks and S.U.V.s every year, along with a handful of sedans and hybrids \u2014 with the eco-tech-mobility conglomerate Hackett envisions it becoming. One lesson Hackett learned from his studies is that in order to stay competitive, businesses often have to give up the things that made them great in the first place. (He calls this the \u201cperversity law.\u201d) I asked him if this meant that Ford would need to stop manufacturing conventional, gas-powered vehicles to survive.\u201cWell, part of that statement might be right,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He clarified, sort of: \u201cI\u2019m really just trying to say the better form of problem solving is to abstract the problems.\u201dSo let\u2019s try abstracting Ford\u2019s problems, to see how they might be solved. First: Ford was born at the beginning of a now-outmoded era of industrial production, one that it arguably ushered in. Back then, companies like Ford simply manufactured goods, and customers bought them. Those transactions represented a change of ownership \u2014 a customer who bought a car from Ford was free to install 15-inch subwoofers in it, or paint it bright yellow, or use it in a demolition derby \u2014 and they were typically one-time sales. Ford\u2019s responsibility for the car, and its opportunity to make a profit, ended the minute the warranty ran out.The internet changed that, by allowing companies to wrap physical goods in digital services that can be sold again and again, at much higher margins. Instead of selling servers to corporate I.T. departments, Amazon sells them time shares on a centralized server farm; instead of buying pricey home solar panels, customers can lease them from a solar service, paying for only the power they use. Makers of thermostats, baby monitors and other household gadgets \u201cextend the value chain\u201d by charging customers a monthly fee for information about their home energy use or their babies\u2019 sleep patterns. Even the language these new enterprises use is different. Goods-based businesses spoke in terms of revenues and profits. Service-based businesses count metrics like \u201cchurn,\u201d \u201caverage revenue per user\u201d and \u201clifetime value\u201d \u2014 the total amount of money they can wring from a customer.This phenomenon \u2014 which is sometimes referred to as \u201ceverything as a service,\u201d abbreviated as XaaS and pronounced \u201czass,\u201d among the kinds of people who say these things out loud \u2014 has quietly reshaped the entire economy. Trucking companies that once bought Michelin tires now rent them through a pay-per-mile service. Airlines that buy $15 million jet engines from General Electric can subscribe to OnPoint, a \u201cpower by the hour\u201d program that includes maintenance costs and data-analysis tools. G.E. Aviation now makes the better part of its revenue from services like these.The auto industry was slow to come to grips with this new model \u2014 in part because it long ago gave away the entire service piece of its business to gas stations, body shops, Jiffy Lubes and a hundred other barnacle industries. Thanks to old and byzantine state laws, most carmakers aren\u2019t even allowed to sell or lease directly to their customers \u2014 every transaction has to go through an independent dealer. When it comes to data, automakers are flying blind. As Reilly P. Brennan, a venture capitalist who invests in self-driving technology, put it to me: \u201cThe urinal in the men\u2019s bathroom knows more about its users than most carmakers in 2017.\u201dWith self-driving cars, automakers see a chance to fix that. Ford\u2019s executives talk hopefully about one day offering their own suite of software inside their autonomous vehicles, and building interfaces that companies like Netflix and Skype could plug into. They don\u2019t see themselves usurping Silicon Valley, exactly, but they do see themselves playing in the same league. \u201cTwo to three years ago, the tech community was holding the auto industry at arm\u2019s length,\u201d said Ken Washington, Ford\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cThey thought we were sort of this curious industry that they could come into and disrupt.\u201d He went on: \u201cNow, when I go to Silicon Valley and I interact with tech companies, it\u2019s a dynamic of much more intense interest in collaborating with us.\u201dCollaboration takes many forms, of course, and not all tech companies seem interested in an equal partnership. John Krafcik, the chief executive of Waymo, told me that while traditional auto companies \u201cbring a lot to the party\u201d in terms of hardware expertise, they\u2019re not well equipped to solve the software-based problem of replacing a human driver, which requires huge teams of highly skilled engineers and tremendous amounts of technological infrastructure \u2014 the kinds of tools available to only a Google sibling company. \u201cThe self-driving aspect is really supercomplicated,\u201d Krafcik said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last nine years trying to solve that puzzle. It requires a lot of skills.\u201d It also requires focus, which is a problem for companies that still sell millions of conventional cars and trucks a year, that have thousands of employees to pay and quarterly results to deliver, that can\u2019t exactly drop everything and become software companies.In Detroit, cautious optimism prevails. But outside Detroit, there are real doubts that any auto company can transform itself quickly enough. \u201cAutonomous vehicles are not an incremental shift,\u201d said Carol Reiley, a founder of Drive.ai. \u201cIt\u2019s a very transformative shift, almost like moving from the horse and carriage to the car.\u201d Like many tech executives, Reiley saw Detroit\u2019s quest to control the self-driving-car industry as tactically sound but ultimately a long shot. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they can make it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of baggage.\u201dA week after my Detroit trip, I visited the Pittsburgh offices of Argo AI, the artificial-intelligence start-up that is creating the software brains for Ford\u2019s self-driving vehicles. Ford is investing $1 billion for a majority stake and controls two of Argo\u2019s five board seats. Which means that Argo is an independent company, but only barely \u2014 40 of its 230 employees are transfers from Ford, and Ford is its only corporate partner.Argo\u2019s headquarters is in Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District, a formerly industrial area just outside downtown that has become a center of driverless-car activity. (Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Group is down the street.) Its office is a high-ceilinged space in a modern office building with conference rooms named for famous scientists: Planck, Descartes, Hopper. When I arrived, engineers were eating catered lunch at their standing desks. Squint and ignore the smokestacks outside, and you could be in San Francisco \u2014 which is sort of the point. Ford wants Argo to look and feel like a nimble tech start-up, not a subsidiary of a century-old auto company.I was greeted by Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander, Argo AI\u2019s founders, both well-known figures in the small self-driving-car world. They had been special-faculty members at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s prestigious robotics-engineering program, and Salesky competed in the 2007 Darpa Urban Challenge, a storied self-driving-vehicle race whose alumni now populate the top ranks of the autonomous-vehicle industry. Salesky went to Google to build self-driving cars; Rander went to Uber. They quit their jobs and started Argo AI in November of last year, and in February, with no real product to speak of, and hardly any employees, they announced that they had raised huge sums of money from Ford.The day before my visit, Salesky made waves with a bombastic post on the company\u2019s blog, in which he accused the autonomous-vehicle industry of overselling its progress. \u201cThose who think fully self-driving vehicles will be ubiquitous on city streets months from now or even in a few years,\u201d he wrote, \u201care not well connected to the state of the art or committed to the safe deployment of the technology.\u201d It was a rare role reversal \u2014 the software engineer throwing up caution flags \u2014 and, perhaps, evidence that Ford is trying to stall for time. Officially, Argo is still aiming for Ford\u2019s 2021 target, but Salesky waffled on the firmness of that deadline, saying there\u2019s a chance a true Level 4 autonomous vehicle could be finished later, or possibly sooner. \u201cIt\u2019s ready when it\u2019s ready,\u201d he told me.Salesky freely admitted that he is playing catch-up. Ford won\u2019t share statistics about its self-driving test cars, but public records from California give some sense of what it\u2019s up against. Last year, Ford, which does most of its testing in Michigan and Arizona, logged just 590 autonomous miles in the state, while Waymo\u2019s vehicles logged 635,867 miles. Argo is also building its code from scratch and doesn\u2019t have access to the digital infrastructure that competitors like Waymo and Uber do. \u201cWe\u2019re not out there trying to tell everyone we\u2019re going to be first or beat X, Y or Z company,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cThe goal is to get to market with something that can scale up.\u201dIn order to work properly, a self-driving car also has to understand how humans behave. It needs to know the difference between a car that is idling in the right-hand lane (in which case the autonomous vehicle should steer around it) and one that is about to parallel park (in which case the vehicle should stay in its lane, giving the other car some room). It needs to predict that the jogger running toward the corner will stop for traffic, but that the kid running to chase a basketball might not. It needs to be able to navigate a four-way stop, which in polite parts of the country involves lots of eye contact and you-first hand gestures. \u201cThis goes beyond just seeing and understanding the world,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cIt means understanding what each of the actors in the world is going to do.\u201dIn other words, driving isn\u2019t just a mechanical task \u2014 it\u2019s a social act, and in order to coexist with human drivers, self-driving cars will need to develop a level of social awareness that approaches that of a full-fledged A.I. This is why some computer scientists think Waymo is going to be unbeatable. As an Alphabet company, Waymo has access to some of the best engineering talent in A.I., along with Google\u2019s enormous data troves and the machine-learning systems that have been trained using that data. In other words, the vast data-harvesting powers that make Google\u2019s consumer products so creepy could also make Waymo\u2019s vehicles better at navigating the physical world.But all this obsessive focus on tech elides a much more foundational question about our relationship to cars. Tech companies tend to view driving as a functional problem \u2014 get safely from Point A to Point B as quickly as possible \u2014 in which the vehicle itself is largely an extraneous variable. A car might begin its life as a Toyota or a Hyundai, but once it\u2019s autonomous and on a ride-sharing network, it\u2019s just an Uber. Silicon Valley believes that software, not hardware, is what matters to riders, and this will be especially true of self-driving cars \u2014 which, at least in early days, will most likely be shared among strangers.But Detroit has spent decades and billions of advertising dollars persuading us that its mass-produced cars are anything but homogeneous metal boxes \u2014 that they carry profound talismanic qualities that transfer to their owners. You can be an F-150 woman or a Mustang man, and those choices signal tribal affiliations that extend far past the act of driving. Ford\u2019s challenge, then, is keeping these storied brands alive for the consumers who still obsess over them, while Argo builds the software that will satisfy the car-agnostic city dwellers. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act, made even more complicated by the politics of a 114-year-old Detroit manufacturing company lashing its fate to a one-year-old Pittsburgh tech start-up, and vice versa. \u201cThey\u2019ve put a lot of trust in us,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also put a lot of trust in them.\u201dBill Ford has been working in the family business for 38 years and spent most of that time as an iconoclast. His interest in \u201csmart mobility\u201d \u2014 which amounts to an interest in reducing the number of cars on the road \u2014 was until recently considered heretical. But the past few years have vindicated his predictions. He thinks that the coming convergence of tech and transportation could turn Detroit and Silicon Valley into permanent collaborators. He started Fontinalis Partners, a venture-capital fund outside Ford, to invest in mobility start-ups, and flies regularly to San Francisco to meet with entrepreneurs working on transportation-related projects.\u201cThe narrative, probably even two years ago, would have been \u2018tech companies win, autos lose,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened, though, is there\u2019s been a realization that we have a lot more intellectual property than the world realized,\u201d by which he means celebrated lines like the F-150, along with some proprietary under-the-hood technology that I won\u2019t pretend to understand. \u201cSecond, we really know how to integrate a lot of what the tech companies have into our vehicles, and we know how to make vehicles as well.\u201dI was struck by how frequently this simple point is deployed at Ford: We know how to make stuff, and making stuff isn\u2019t easy. At first, I dismissed it as a na\u00efve attempt to steer a conversation about Detroit\u2019s shortcomings back toward its strengths. Apple taught suppliers halfway across the world how to make iPhones with micron-level precision \u2014 how hard could it be to slap some metal together and put it on wheels?But making cars isn\u2019t like making other things. It\u2019s a dizzying logistical ballet that involves heavy machinery, grueling labor and countless opportunities for error. It\u2019s wrangling union contracts while keeping the line moving. It\u2019s paying people enough to ensure that they won\u2019t miss a loose bolt and kill someone. It\u2019s designing objects that not only work well but also fill a psychological need for buyers. In the end, maybe the self-driving-car race will be decided not purely on technological achievement, but also on these much more prosaic questions \u2014 who can make good things and persuade people to use them? After all, the Model T wasn\u2019t the first car invented, or the best at the time. But it was accessible and functional and spoke to people\u2019s needs in a simple way during a time of confusing technological change. That conversation is about to begin again.Kevin Roose is a business-and-technology columnist for The Times and a writer at large for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Strikes Deal With Volvo to Bring Self-Driving Cars to Its Network", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 No one knows what the future of self-driving cars will look like, or how long it will take to get there. But every major player in the field is striking partnerships to be ready for the day when autonomous vehicles finally become mainstream.That includes Uber, which on Monday announced a new deal with Volvo. Under the agreement, Uber plans to purchase as many as 24,000 self-driving Volvos once the technology is production-ready, putting the vehicles into its extensive ride-hailing network.\u201cEverything we\u2019re doing right now is about building autonomous vehicles at scale,\u201d Jeff Miller, Uber\u2019s head of automotive alliances, said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly how an autonomous world will look. But we know that we want to be the platform that\u2019s at the center of it, from a ride-sharing standpoint.\u201dThe deal is an extension of an agreement Uber made with Volvo nearly two years ago, when the ride-hailing company started its research and development efforts in autonomous vehicles in earnest. Uber has worked with third-party component manufacturers to build software and hardware for driverless cars, then worked closely with Volvo to outfit the automaker\u2019s XC90 vehicles with the technology.But the new deal vastly increases the number of Volvo driverless cars that Uber can work with, showing the scope of its ambitions.\u201cThe only way we could control our own destiny was to work with this technology that had the potential to disrupt our business, and have direct involvement in the creation of it,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford to be on the outside looking in. We have to be in the game.\u201dMr. Miller said that Uber would own and operate fleets of its own vehicles purchased from partners like Volvo, but that there was no one-size-fits-all approach, so it would also allow other self-driving vehicles on its network.An earlier version of this article misstated the type of vehicle Tesla recently unveiled. It was an electric semi-truck that is nearly self-driving, it is not fully autonomous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Cars Cooperate", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "Someday cars will drive themselves and coordinate with one another and smart cities and roadways to eliminate traffic jams and accidents \u2014 including the fatal one that happens in the United States every 15 minutes \u2014 while reducing fuel consumption and effectively giving back to Americans an annual per-capita average of 335 hours in which, for better or worse, they can use their hands and eyeballs in other ways. When and in what shape this utopian future will arrive, though, remains a persistent mystery. What is certain is that those who play the largest roles in solving it will be in a position to dictate \u2014 as those who control infrastructure always have been \u2014 which people and places they will empower and which they will upend.An intelligent automated future, however, depends on the maturation of two entirely separate sets of technologies. The first \u2014 and the one that has drawn most of the investment and media attention in the last five years \u2014 will allow vehicles to drive themselves without any input from their surroundings. The other set of technologies will connect vehicles to their surroundings and to one another, in order to optimize the functioning of the vehicular ecosystem as a whole. Ultimately, these two types of systems will have to complement each other, yet neither can be implemented all at once. In the meantime, the process of developing and deploying them often puts them at odds. Indeed, the two systems are, in a sense, philosophically opposed: libertarian self-reliance in a race with socialist collectivity to be the first to improve traffic flow.In Silicon Valley and elsewhere, where numerous start-ups are competing with software giants like Google and Uber in the \u201cself-driving\u201d category, Peloton has left high-level automation out of its immediate business plan. Rather, it has staked its early success \u2014 and the money of investors like UPS, Volvo and Intel \u2014 on a cooperative technology known as \u201cvehicle-to-vehicle communication,\u201d or V2V, which makes use of a shortwave portion of the radio spectrum that the Federal Communications Commission set aside in 1999 primarily for traffic-safety messaging. A signal can zip through this bandwidth thousands of times faster than the second or two it might typically take a driver to react. This valuable swath of ether (worth billions to the telecommunications industry, which is currently lobbying the F.C.C. to \u201cshare\u201d it) facilitates unlimited potential applications, not just for sending data among vehicles but also for syncing them with traffic lights and other features of the environment. Currently, vehicles using it \u2014 the vast majority belonging to research pilot projects \u2014 broadcast encrypted information 10 times per second to any receivers within 1,000 feet that can decode it. This means that, unlike vehicles that are automated but not connected, they can \u201csee\u201d beyond their actual field of view: an accident just over the crest of a hill, an oncoming car around the corner. \u201cIt will save lives, and everybody knows that,\u201d says Harry Lightsey, the executive director for emerging-technologies policy at General Motors, maker of the 2017 Cadillac CTS, the first commercially available car in the United States to carry the technology. \u201cA delay in rolling out V2V will cost lives, and that\u2019s a tragedy.\u201dPeloton believes that trucking companies are the natural place to start: They can outfit entire fleets at once and reap significant benefits from small improvements. Moreover, most of the 279 billion annual miles trucks travel are on highways, which are far more predictable than city streets and therefore an easier environment in which to usher in new driving features. Thus, the trucking industry is poised to be among the first to adopt both V2V and automated technologies on a grand scale, possibly becoming the arena in which they will compete with each other most ferociously for initial relevance and public acceptance.On the day I met Mercer, he and Jake Gregory, a veteran F.B.I. agent who drove trucks in college and directed safety operations for a small fleet after leaving the bureau, were demonstrating Peloton\u2019s first V2V application, called \u201cplatooning,\u201d in a pair of 18-wheelers. (\u201cPeloton,\u201d the French word for \u201cplatoon,\u201d also designates the main pack of cyclists in a road race.) They eased out onto I-280 with Mercer in the lead. I rode with Gregory, whose cab had been retrofitted with theater-style seats where a bunk bed used to be. These were occupied by Steve Boyd, a Peloton founder, who oversees external affairs; Oliver Bayley, the head of user experience design; and Rod McLane, the company\u2019s marketing manager.Gregory flipped a switch on the dash, and a screen \u2014 mounted where a car\u2019s rearview mirror usually is \u2014 blinked on. \u201cPlatooning not authorized in this area,\u201d it said. The system, Gregory said, was calculating the weight of Mercer\u2019s truck ahead: \u201cIt takes a few minutes for it to establish mass.\u201d The software also used a cellular signal to check with a cloud-based server run by Peloton engineers to see if Gregory was in an appropriate location: a divided highway accessible by only on-off ramps, more easily negotiated than crossings.The system chimed, and the message changed: \u201cReady to platoon.\u201d Gregory pressed a button that allowed Mercer\u2019s truck to take control of his throttle and braking systems over the V2V bandwidth. It began to reel Gregory\u2019s truck in until they were exactly 66 feet apart. By maintaining that gap, it created a slipstream that reduced carbon emissions and saved fuel by an average of 7 percent: 10 percent for the follower and 5 percent for the leader. (A team led by researchers at Purdue University, with a grant from the United States Department of Energy, believes it can help Peloton increase the average to 20 percent, which the team estimates would be worth up to $20 billion a year to the trucking industry.)While continuing to steer, Gregory removed both feet from the pedals and planted them on the floorboard. Mercer slowed at an exit ramp, and Gregory\u2019s truck automatically did, too, beeping at him to resume control. When I first heard about platooning, I imagined it would feel more death-defying, but though the size of the gap had initially unsettled Mercer and Gregory, it attracted little notice on the highway; oblivious passenger-car drivers frequently cut in, dissolving the platoon. In practice, the exercise felt more like an elaborate cruise-control upgrade than the opening bell in a transportation revolution. Bayley agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing!\u201dCritics of V2V, especially those who are solely invested in full automation, dismiss platooning as mere high-speed tailgating. The major added safety benefits, they point out, come from the fact that, in order to platoon, trucks must be equipped with advanced safety features. Peloton readily agrees that its application, whose requirements include air disc brakes and state-of-the-art collision-avoidance, is an incentive for fleets to upgrade. V2V proponents, on the other hand, hope to leverage renewed federal interest in their systems to expand projects that have been gestating for decades. The Department of Transportation, under the outgoing Obama administration, proposed requiring that all new passenger vehicles be equipped with V2V \u2014 at least symbolically moving toward the realization of those goals. Earlier this month, however, reports suggested that the Trump administration might be inclined to shelve the proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s important to get our government leaders to commit to this,\u201d says Larry Head, an engineering professor at the University of Arizona, who is collaborating on V2I applications with Peloton. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait five years. We\u2019re ready now.\u201dAs a society, we routinely make comparable decisions: when we let football players give one another brain damage in the interests of public entertainment; when a surgeon refrains from killing one terminal patient and transplanting his organs into five patients whom they might save. The trolley problem heightens individual culpability by bestowing absolute decision-making power on one person and demanding that she select not between actions but consequences, which in real life are rarely inevitable. Arguably, in doing so, the dilemma tends to reveal our natural inclination to accept fate over premeditation in situations with no happy outcomes, even if planning might partly mitigate an otherwise inevitable tragedy.In recent years, the trolley problem has frequently been adapted to discussions about entirely automated cars, which respond to contingencies with binary logic. Suppose a distracted mother pushes a stroller with her baby in it out in front of such a vehicle \u2014 should the car be programmed to hit them or swerve into a tree? Azim Shariff, the director of the Culture and Morality Lab at the University of California, Irvine, was an author of a 2016 report in Science that described a series of surveys he and colleagues conducted in which participants overwhelmingly approved of autonomous vehicles, as the study terms them, that would \u201csacrifice their passengers for the greater good\u201d and \u201cwould like others to buy them.\u201d Unsurprisingly, however, they expressed a preference to ride themselves in autonomous vehicles that protect their passengers \u201cat all costs.\u201dEngineers tend to scoff at the trolley exercise. (\u201cI think the vehicle\u2019s going to stop,\u201d Larry Head told me.) But Shariff says this response takes the problem too literally. \u201cThat particular scenario may never come up, but the fundamental ethical trade-off that it\u2019s revealing, apportioning risks among people on the road, is going to happen all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt already does.\u201d Inching closer to a cyclist in the right lane to move farther from a semi on the left, for instance, prioritizes your safety over the cyclist\u2019s. Leaving that \u201cdecision\u201d up to your subconscious becomes its own ethical choice, he added, once \u201cthe luxury of deliberation\u201d embodied by the preprogrammed car exists. Human error contributes to an estimated 95 percent of crashes; in theory, automated and connected cars can eliminate our mistakes. \u201cIf you recognize that one option is safer,\u201d Shariff says, \u201cand you choose the other option, that\u2019s a moral decision.\u201dAt the moment, V2V merely transfers information without dictating how it is used. But as its reach expands, potentially linking drivers, carmakers and telecommunications companies with state, city and local governments and other private and public interests in a vast network orchestrating the use of what are essentially lethal weapons, questions of responsibility become more complicated. V2V-enabled vehicles would broadcast their size, speed, acceleration and braking activity and location (down to the lane), according to the latest standards. Who will be allowed to access that data? Will it remain anonymous, as automakers currently intend? Who will defend the network against hackers and keep up-to-date the critical software that collects, analyzes and translates that data into best practices for each of its users? Do drivers have the ultimate right to control their cars \u2014 even if they want to speed, say \u2014 or should the network be programmed to prevent them from doing so? Should it matter whether they\u2019re flooring it because they\u2019re drunk or delivering a pregnant woman in labor to the hospital?Of course, governments and standards organizations already confront similar utilitarian questions. Early airbags were designed to protect men of average height and weight at the expense of those outside the bell curve; when ambulances run red lights to save a dying patient, they increase the risk of death for everyone around them; a turn-only lane might be safer for bicyclists but worsen vehicle congestion or put a store out of business. Still, each of these decisions can be modified on the micro level by human behavior. The ambulance driver\u2019s experience and his reactions to traffic conditions might mitigate his accident risk. An algorithm applies norms uniformly. Those presets would need to function nationwide, which would require countless entities with conflicting interests and values to submit to a single interpretation of what is best for most people. (Until a majority of cars are fully automated and connected, such a network would most likely behave as the Waze navigation app does, delivering information to human or automated drivers for them to interpret.)Unfortunately, as a species, humans are notoriously inept at acting in our own long-term interest. Imagine an algorithm for hurricane evacuation that moves cars faster than human drivers would \u2014 \u201cbalancing the risk of a more-damaging accident from the higher speed against the benefit of getting people out of the evacuation zone faster,\u201d William Whyte, a prominent automotive cybersecurity consultant, wrote to me in an email. \u201cThat would be an algorithm that on average worked better than current practice but, when it failed, would fail worse. I think that people would probably feel uncomfortable with that in the same way that they feel uncomfortable on planes \u2014 there\u2019s a combination of lack of control plus the fact that if things go wrong, they go very wrong, which triggers all the ways that people are very bad at risk assessment.\u201dWithout federal help, however, the upfront cost of connected infrastructure can be prohibitive for small towns and cities. Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and an affiliate scholar at Stanford\u2019s Center for Internet and Society, recently challenged a group of students to come up with ways to secure public funding for vehicle-to-infrastructure technology that would enable more governments to afford it. One idea was to use the technology at intersections to collect traffic data and sell it to the developers of automated systems to improve their algorithms; another was to use the dedicated bandwidth in cars to create a meshlike internet network for rural areas, eliminating the need to put down expensive fiber cable.Perhaps the most provocative idea, Smith told me, was a \u201ccrash bounty.\u201d He explained: \u201cWe\u2019ve posited that V2I can improve safety \u2014 what if you could come up with a scheme for monetizing that? If you could prove you had prevented a crash, you could bill the people who otherwise would have been injured or killed: \u2018Good news, we\u2019re 80 percent sure that we saved you from an injury that would have cost you tens of thousands of dollars, so, insurance company, pay up $40,000 and be happy with that.\u2019\u2009\u201dTo get a sense of how V2V stands to improve the system as a whole, it helps to understand how cities cope without it. To that end, on a recent Monday morning, just after rush hour, I joined Wilson Aleman and Al Vilar, who have been engineers at the Boston Transportation Department for a cumulative five decades, in the Traffic Management Center on the seventh floor of City Hall. Aleman wore a Red Sox cap. Vilar wore glasses with small eyepieces and thick lenses that gave him the look of a jeweler examining a precious stone.In front of them, a bank of screens displayed live video of various intersections: cars double-parking on narrow, curving roads; pedestrians disregarding stoplights. Aleman could remember when the video screens used to be a board with a real-time LED map on it \u2014 and when the department received postmarked letters of complaint instead of tweets, emails and phone calls. Over the last two decades, Boston has connected 68 percent of its lighted intersections to the Traffic Management Center, allowing engineers to adjust the signaling patterns in real time. The department estimates this has reduced travel times by about 15 percent and emissions and crashes by 8 percent each; it also yields economic benefits of approximately $14 million each year, compared with the $318,000 it cost to implement. Still, much of the traffic data \u2014 which helps to determine optimal signal timing as well as the city\u2019s future investments \u2014 comes from people logging car movements by hand. Widespread V2V would give traffic departments like Boston\u2019s a wealth of detailed information about key locations. (If all cars had V2V, they could blaze through complex intersections without stopping at all, modifying their speeds and headings to slide into gaps.) Maintenance, however, would be a significant challenge.Aleman showed me his computer monitor, where the connected lights were represented on a city map as red or green dots. The red dots were ones that weather, construction or local hardware issues had taken offline. He pointed to two reds very close together on Commonwealth Avenue that could strand cars between them and block cross-traffic. \u201cThose are the ones I like to attack,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are important to me.\u201d The phone rang. It was a communications specialist who was elbow-deep in a control box on one of Aleman\u2019s corners, working on a surge protector. \u201cMaybe if you unplug one at a time?\u201d Aleman suggested.On another phone, Vilar was patiently discussing the timing of a new light on Endicott Street at Keany Square with one of the street\u2019s residents. \u201cWe\u2019ll get it so it\u2019s working better; right now it\u2019s working safer because there\u2019s less cars coming at you.\u201d He paused. \u201cThey\u2019re ready to march on City Hall, I know.\u201d One-way, residential Endicott begins as an offshoot of I-93 North and ends where the causeway and the Charlestown Bridge converge as six lanes. The light makes it slower to turn left. But, Vilar explained once he\u2019d hung up, \u201cwe can\u2019t make it beautiful, because then it will siphon off cars from the causeway.\u201dHe pointed to the Endicott video feed where, sure enough, a line of cars was forming. \u201cSee, now it\u2019s like 14 cars deep, people honking \u2014 you want it to be more serene, especially when you\u2019re eating dinner,\u201d he said. But say those cars weren\u2019t there, and I-93 was backed up, and Google Maps began suggesting Endicott as a shortcut. \u201cSo now you\u2019ve got a guy who just got off there, maybe he\u2019s enraged, instead of going 30 he\u2019s going 40, a kid runs out into the street because he\u2019s not used to the traffic being there. ... \u201d Vilar said. \u201cYou want to make it so it\u2019s moving. You want him to think: I\u2019ll be O.K. I don\u2019t want to get off this street. I\u2019ll stay.\u201d A V2V network could make these sorts of intricate adjustments instantly and indefatigably, but it would do so without Vilar\u2019s empathy for the harried commuter or the family conversing over supper.\u201cSometimes people call,\u201d he said, \u201cand they just want to rant, and you\u2019re just a punching bag for those people, and that\u2019s part of the job.\u201d Vilar grew up in the North End; he, his wife and his children still live nearby. \u201cThe woman who just called, she\u2019s almost like an aunt to me,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has my number.\u201dMore than a century later, in the context of platooning, privacy seems to be able to foster community as much as disrupt it. The dedicated channel over which one truck controls others allows the drivers to converse exclusively with one another, as opposed to using their C.B. radio, which is rife with vulgar chatter. Dave Mercer used to keep his turned off unless he needed news about road conditions. But during the test run, he and Jake Gregory exchanged frequent notes on moves they planned to make or vehicles that the other couldn\u2019t see; Mercer described it as \u201cJake and I looking out for each other on the road.\u201dMight the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in this way reform the macho trucking culture, increasing the diversity of drivers, only 5.1 percent of whom are women? Or might including more varied perspectives in the design process result in even more innovative applications of V2V? The homogeneity at leading technology companies is well documented. Still, it seems notable, considering how infrastructure and power reinforce each other, that of the several dozen engineers, academics and standards developers I spoke with whose thinking is shaping the future of V2V, most were white and all but one was male.Artificial systems evolve \u2014 just as natural systems do \u2014 by applying strict rules to events that are often swayed by chance, and the results are frequently surprising. Relinquishing control of our vehicles to algorithms may ultimately transform us from drivers to passengers who tranquilly observe our surroundings from within our bubble or ignore them altogether in favor of watching a movie or checking email. Then again, by the time that sort of algorithm is ready, more and more of us may choose to depend on ride-sharing applications like Uber and Lyft for personal travel and delivery services, or even 3-D printing for goods we once needed a car to go get and pay for. \u201cI have three daughters; they\u2019re totally uninterested in driving,\u201d Jack Pokrzywa, director of global ground vehicle standards for SAE International, told me. \u201cWhen I got my license, I was 17. I was in seventh heaven.\u201dFor those of us for whom a visit to the D.M.V. was a rite of passage, it\u2019s easy to forget that, before Americans found freedom inside a motor vehicle, they found it on foot and astride horses, in covered wagons and trains, on ships, buses, planes, bicycles, roller skates. They found it in pure motion, on a journey to someplace beyond what they could imagine. Where it began and where it ended was still theirs to decide. Likewise, automated connected vehicles stand to make travel safer, maybe even boring, but somebody still has to get in and tell them where to go.Advertisement"}

While the move isn\u2019t dependent on the tax bill going through, Hock Tan, Broadcom\u2019s famously reticent C.E.O., publicly told President Trump at a news conference: \u201cThanks to you, Mr. President, business conditions have steadily improved.\u201dAT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner is a vertical merger that doesn\u2019t lead to consolidation within one particular industry, leaving few legal options. Mr. Trump has publicly opposed the merger, but the Justice Department\u2019s new antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has said that he won\u2019t let politics sway his decision-making.But other than Andrew Liveris of DowDuPont, it appears that none of the corporate leaders who served on any of the now-disbanded presidential councils is going. G.E., which had a seat on the president\u2019s manufacturing council when Jeff Immelt was C.E.O., is sending a lower-level executive.Mr. Trump is bringing 29 chief executives to Beijing, where the administration hopes to announce billions of dollars of new deals for American industry.

{"Headline": "Self-Driving Trucks May Be Closer Than They Appear", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "With fewer cultural hurdles and more financial incentives than car owners, big-rig operators are charting the route to an autonomous future.Supported byTrucks will someday drive themselves out of warehouses and cruise down freeways without the aid of humans or even a driver\u2019s cab \u2014 about that there seems little disagreement. The question is how soon that day gets here.And while the answers vary \u2014 technologists, not surprisingly, are more bullish than truckers \u2014 billions of dollars and a growing parade of companies, from tiny start-ups to the country\u2019s biggest trucking operations, are betting it will be here sooner than most people think.This year, companies and investors are on pace to put just over $1 billion into self-driving and other trucking technologies, 10 times the level of three years ago, according to CB Insights, which tracks the venture capital industry.Tesla is widely expected this week to showcase an electric truck that will have some self-driving capabilities. And Embark, a Silicon Valley start-up, is set to announce on Monday that it has been testing its self-driving technology as part of a three-way partnership with the truck-leasing company Ryder and the appliance giant Electrolux.\u201cWe are trying to get self-driving technology out on the road as fast as possible,\u201d said Alex Rodrigues, Embark\u2019s chief executive. \u201cTrucking needs self-driving and self-driving needs trucking.\u201dUnlike autonomous cars, which face questions about navigating chaotic urban streets, trucks spend a lot of time heading straight on desolate highways. And while the advent of the self-driving car will rest on the decisions of individual consumers, logistics companies are unemotional operators that will upgrade their fleets the moment it makes financial sense.Trucking is a $700 billion industry that touches every corner of the economy. Trucks haul natural resources from mines and forests. They transport industrial building blocks from manufacturers and deliver goods to stores and homes. Virtually every physical product from food to paper towels and furniture has touched a truck several times by the time it gets to a consumer\u2019s hands.The industry\u2019s size makes it a fat target for automation. Autonomous technology will help trucking companies reduce labor costs in the long run, first by extending the number of hours trucks are in operation, and later, by reducing the number of drivers. The industry spends billions of dollars a year on accidents that are largely caused by human error, and billions more on insurance premiums that should go down if and when self-driving technology is proven to be safer than human drivers.Even companies not explicitly chasing the goal of self-driving trucks are moving steadily toward a more automated future. The 7,000-plus trucks owned by US Xpress, one of the nation\u2019s largest trucking companies, have been updated with autonomous braking and collision-avoidance systems. Max Fuller, the company\u2019s co-founder and executive chairman, plans to upgrade them to have automated lane steering in three years.\u201cI\u2019m putting building blocks into my trucks that each year gets us closer and closer,\u201d he said.Companies have a lot to get through before they can start legally operating trucks without drivers. Beyond technical and regulatory hurdles, the industry is sure to be challenged by wild cards like how human drivers react to seeing a unmanned truck gliding down the highway and how regulators respond when the inevitable first deadly autonomous-trucking accident occurs. If such a backlash were to happen before the technology has been widely adopted, it could slow things for years.But whenever self-driving trucks arrive, there will be economic ripples, affecting insurance premiums, truck stops, vocational schools and the roads themselves. \u201cThis is the most powerful thing to hit us since the building of the superhighways in the 1950s,\u201d said No\u00ebl Perry, an economist at FTR Research, which tracks the logistics industry.One afternoon in Florida, a 59-year-old career truck driver named Jeff Runions sat alertly in the cab of an 18-wheeler watching the road while his 11-ton cargo of stone tile made its way up the Ronald Reagan Turnpike. He was watching his steering wheel, too, but his hands were at his side: A computer was in control.Mr. Runions works for Starsky Robotics, a San Francisco start-up that for the past two years has been testing its self-driving technology by running freight up and down Florida. The runs help collect data and hone the technology, in hopes of convincing regulators and the company itself that self-driving trucks are ready for business.There are still plenty of kinks. Sitting next to Mr. Runions was an Irish engineer named Rebecca Feeney Barry. As the vehicle spent hours driving past swamps and billboards for accident lawyers, Ms. Feeney Barry balanced a laptop on her knees and watched how the truck\u2019s sensors interpreted the road and nearby cars.At one point the computer\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d briefly lost sight of the freeway because an overpass shaded the road. Later, the truck didn\u2019t take a turn hard enough, prompting Mr. Runions to grab the wheel. Ms. Feeney Barry logged all of it. Later, after some computer code had been altered to tell the truck to tug the wheel a bit harder, it made a similar turn more smoothly.\u201cSometimes it kind of messes me up when I go back to driving because now I\u2019m used to the truck driving,\u201d Mr. Runions said.Starsky\u2019s ultimate plan, of course, is to eliminate Mr. Runions\u2019s job. But they do not want him to be out of one. Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Starsky\u2019s 27-year-old chief executive, foresees using self-driving technology to replace long-haul drivers on freeways, but having people like Mr. Runions navigate at either end of the trip with remote control consoles that look like an arcade racing game.Drivers would go off to work in offices and might spend their day driving trucks through the last few miles of several different routes in several different cities before heading home for dinner.\u201cOne driver can drive 10 to 30 trucks per day,\u201d Mr. Seltz-Axmacher said.Starsky\u2019s vision of a remote operation is unique. But the basic idea \u2014 having trucks drive themselves on highways and letting human drivers take over in complicated city environments \u2014 is something of an industry consensus.\u201cOne of the big misconceptions about self-driving technology is that it is going to emerge and be able to drive all the time in all circumstances,\u201d said Alden Woodrow, the product manager for Uber\u2019s self-driving truck unit.As part of their partnership, Embark, Ryder and Electrolux are conducting what amounts to elaborate dry runs to imagine what self-driving-truck routes will look like. The runs start with human drivers leaving an Electrolux warehouse in El Paso and driving to the edge of the city, where they hitch the trailer to one of Embark\u2019s autonomous trucks.From there the truck drives itself for 650 highway miles (with a safety driver in tow) to Ontario, Calif., where the Embark drivers transfer their trailer to another Ryder driver, who drives the final few miles to one of Electrolux\u2019s California warehouses.\u201cIt\u2019s a mirror of what we would do if there weren\u2019t a driver inside,\u201d said Mr. Rodrigues, the Embark chief.A few miles from Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., a company called Peloton Technology is betting that there is a business to be built in a less radical version of automation. Peloton is on the cusp of rolling out a system that will make it easier and safer for trucks to travel one after the other on the highway, in a formation called platooning, helping them save gas by reducing wind drag.Trucks with drivers already do this. But Peloton\u2019s technology aims to make platooning safer with a mix of cameras, sensors and networking equipment, allowing the trucks to talk to each other and helping to prevent the second driver from ramming into the first truck after a sudden stop.Josh Switkes, the company\u2019s chief executive, said that because Peloton\u2019s technology helps drivers get better at doing something they are familiar with, he thinks it can be quickly commercialized.\u201cOur basic approach is let\u2019s bring real value to the fleet and society now,\u201d Mr. Switkes said.Given that trucks are likely to need drivers for some time, it\u2019s no wonder that self-driving companies are almost universally pitching themselves as a friendly partner instead of a job killer. \u201cYou increase productivity, but also make the job more attractive,\u201d Mr. Rodrigues said.And it\u2019s true: Trucking is a brutal job. Drivers endure long, tedious stretches where they are inactive but have to stay focused, and they spend weeks at a time away from home. For those and other reasons, the industry\u2019s biggest problem has been the scarcity and turnover of drivers, making it hard to keep up with shipping demand.\u201cWe see this as a solution to the driver shortage and being able to redeploy them to the jobs they actually want,\u201d said Chris Nordh, senior director of advanced vehicle technologies at Ryder.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that trucking will shed about 300,000 jobs per year \u2014 starting in 25 years. Clearly, that estimate is based on so many ifs that the precise number is not worth fretting over. The bigger point is that as technology gets better, it will start replacing jobs.When Amazon went public in 1997, there wasn\u2019t much worry about huge job losses. Today, online retail companies require about one employee per $1 million of annual sales, versus 3.5 employees per $1 million at physical stores \u2014 a big reason that retail employment is falling by about 100,000 jobs per year, according to the Goldman report.As the saying goes, predictions are hard \u2014 especially about the future. But you can learn a lot by looking at today\u2019s bets. Mr. Fuller, from US Xpress, has a 38-year-old son named Craig.Last year Craig Fuller founded a company called TransRisk, which recently announced a $3.4 million venture capital investment. TransRisk logs millions of transactions and other market data to help trucking companies predict prices along with future supply and demand. Craig Fuller\u2019s bet is that as trucking becomes more automated, trucks will be in motion longer and routed by artificial-intelligence systems.As that happens, he said, the business will be reshuffled. Companies like his father\u2019s \u2014 which exist, more or less, to manage armies of drivers \u2014 will compete with data companies that specialize in managing computers.\u201cWhen you take away the driver and have a business that is completely based on analytics, very few fleets will be able to survive that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m betting on data and information services. He\u2019s betting on owning equipment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Plan Would Scrap Electric-Car Credit, Dampening Market", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 The Republican tax proposal has clouded the outlook for electric vehicles in the United States.The congressional plan presented on Thursday, which would abolish a $7,500 federal income-tax credit for electric vehicles, arrives just as automakers are gearing up to expand their lineups.The credit for purchases of all-electric and plug-in hybrid cars has been a key incentive for consumers to consider switching from traditional gasoline-powered models.The credit has also helped automakers stimulate the market for electrified models, as well as cover their costs as they build a customer base.Yet even with the credit, as well as various state incentives, sales of electrified vehicles remain a tiny fraction of the overall market. The three biggest producers of electric cars \u2014 Tesla, General Motors and Nissan \u2014 have sold about 65,000 of those vehicles this year in the United States. Overall domestic sales for the period have totaled 14.2 million, according to the research firm Autodata.Despite the small numbers, other automakers, such as Ford, Volkswagen and BMW, are gearing up to introduce their first mass-market electric vehicles.Cutting the federal tax credit, however, is likely to dampen expectations for the segment\u2019s expansion.\u201cTax credits are an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles,\u201d G.M. said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cBecause General Motors believes in an all-electric future, we will work with Congress to explore ways to maintain this incentive.\u201dThere was no comment from Tesla, which is preparing to introduce its first mass-market entry, the Model 3 sedan, next year at a base price of $35,000 \u2014 before any tax credit is applied.The loss of the tax credit may cause Tesla to lose some interest among the hundreds of thousands of prospective Model 3 buyers who have put down $1,000 deposits to reserve their cars. Its shares were down almost 7 percent on Thursday, though the company\u2019s financial performance and production delays also weighed on the stock.The tax credit was among the measures the Obama administration took to drive innovation and sales of cleaner vehicles, in the aftermath of the government bailout of General Motors and the former Chrysler in 2009.Companies were allotted 200,000 tax credits to distribute among customers, yet no company has come close to using up its credits because of the low demand.Environmental groups, as expected, were sharply critical of the elimination of the credits.\u201cElectric vehicles are a new industry, and the electric vehicle purchase incentive has been a vital part of getting it off the ground,\u201d said Michelle Robinson, director of the clean-vehicle program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.Dropping the credit would throw the market for electrified vehicles \u201cinto disarray,\u201d and possibly stall broader efforts to build more zero-emission vehicles, Ms. Robinson said.\u201cThese changes would increase pollution and undermine America\u2019s leadership in energy innovation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d squander the progress we have made.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tesla Too Pricey? E-Bikes Offer Entry-Level Electric Transportation", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsElectric cars remain something of a novelty, commanding premium prices and presenting charging challenges, but another kind of electric vehicle has been gaining momentum: the e-bike.Globally, electric cars \u2014 battery and plug-in hybrids \u2014 account for only about 1 percent of all vehicle sales, with about 1.15 million expected to be sold worldwide this year, according to EV-volumes.com. Compare that with the 35 million e-bikes expected to be purchased this year, according to Navigant, with countries like Germany and the Netherlands experiencing double-digit percentage sales growth over the previous year.\u201cWe see e-bikes as the entry point into electric mobility,\u201d said Claudia Wasko, director of e-bikes for Bosch America. Bosch makes one of the more popular electric motor systems for bicycles but is better known as an auto parts supplier and designer of advanced automotive technologies.E-bikes have taken off in Europe, Ms. Wasko said, because they are viewed not just as recreational vehicles but as a practical transportation option. In fact, electric-assist bicycles offer significant advantages over electric cars.\u201cIf you run out of power in an electric car, you have a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a bike, you can still pedal.\u201dAnd then there are the advantages in cost and convenience: E-bikes can be had for less than $1,000, and their batteries can be easily removed, plugged into a regular outlet and charged in about three hours.With designs that have to accommodate a motor and battery, e-bikes are heavier \u2014 weighing about 50 to 60 pounds \u2014 than traditional bicycles. Most models in the United States are pedal-assist e-bikes \u2014 they provide an electric boost only when the rider is pedaling, unlike throttle e-bikes, which can provide assistance even when the rider isn\u2019t pedaling. Typically, pedal-assist models have a handlebar-mounted digital display where riders can select various levels of electronic aid, from zero on level paths to full power when climbing hills or dealing with challenging terrain.Pedal-assist bikes are available in every bike category to appeal to every type of rider. There are step-through cruisers like the Raleigh Sprite iE Step Thru for casual cyclists. There are serious daily commuters like Riese & M\u00fcller\u2019s Charger GX, and there are even folding models like the Oyama CX E8D.\u201cWe think of these as an alternative to cars, not as an alternative to bicycles,\u201d said Sandra Wolf of Riese & M\u00fcller. The company also makes a line of Packster cargo models, which can haul a week\u2019s worth of groceries or two small children.Indeed, the e-bike market is so broad today that every major brand, even those traditionally associated with dedicated cycling enthusiasts, has jumped onto the e-bike saddle.\u201cE-mountain bikes these days are super popular,\u201d said Dominik Geyer of Specialized, whose company did some soul searching before developing its own e-bikes. But now even advocacy groups like the International Mountain Bicycling Association have abandoned their anti-e-bike stance and now support the use of pedal-assist bikes on some trails.E-bikes can enhance the cycling experience for all kinds of riders, from novices to committed commuters who want to extend their routes without arriving at the office soaked in perspiration, said Murray Washburn, the director of global marketing for Cannondale. The technology also encourages owners to ride more often, safe in the knowledge that they can get a boost should they encounter steep hills or become fatigued far from home.Improved technology has also helped their popularity. Manufacturers have switched from motors attached to the hub of the rear wheel to more efficient center-drive motors in the pedal crankshaft, which improve the bike\u2019s center of gravity and handling. New lithium ion batteries are more efficient and able to deliver greater range. Depending on the weight of the cyclist and the terrain, a single charge can last between 20 and 70 miles.More important, the experience is much more akin to riding a traditional bicycle than it was in the past. Less than a decade ago, e-bikes struggled with lugubrious handling and motors that would kick in with a jolt. Today\u2019s models are better balanced and use smart algorithms to apply torque gradually, sensing when the rider is putting more pressure into the pedals and then delivering subtle assistance. The latest models even know when they\u2019re stopped and can help the rider get away after a red light quickly.That adds up to increasing sales. About 400,000 e-bikes are projected to be sold in the United States this year, double last year\u2019s total, according to PeopleForBikes, an advocacy and industry trade group. But that would be just 2.5 percent of the 16 million bikes sold in the country.Before they can succeed here as much as they have in Europe, e-bikes will have to negotiate a few potholes. Most notably, there is the criticism of throttle e-bikes, which can reach speeds of 28 m.p.h. or more, presenting a danger to pedestrians and other cyclists.Nevertheless, the various rules can be confusing. Officials from the New York City Department of Transportation insisted in emails this month that all bicycles with any sort of electrical assistance are illegal, which would make them subject to confiscation and fines of up to $500.But just last month, Mayor Bill de Blasio directly contradicted that view. In an announcement of a crackdown on businesses using all-electric throttle bikes, Mr. de Blasio made it clear that slower pedal-assist e-bikes, like those made by Cannondale, Riese & M\u00fcller and Specialized, \u201care allowable.\u201dBut Tim Blumenthal, the president of PeopleForBikes, said he did not believe that legislative restrictions were as big a factor in sales as cost.While e-bikes are available for about $500, buyers can expect to pay $2,000 or more for a quality model with a reasonable range and reliable service, said Chris Nolte, the owner of Propel Bikes in Brooklyn.Mr. Nolte also recommended that buyers look for models with a center-drive motor and at least a 400-watt lithium-ion battery. Expect a two-year warranty from the manufacturer and a battery life of 1,000 full charges.E-bikes are beginning to acquire a certain cachet, Mr. Nolte said, with more aesthetically appealing models that are difficult to distinguish from regular bicycles. Proponents say the best argument for e-bikes, however, is the experience of riding one.\u201cSome people said, oh, that\u2019s like a motorcycle, that\u2019s not bicycling,\u201d said Mr. Geyer from Specialized. \u201cBut then they rode it and changed their minds.\u201dAdvertisement"}

An analyst at Goldman Sachs just published a research note putting the odds of Republicans changing the tax code at more than 80 percent. But Republicans in the Senate have added a wrinkle: repealing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate at the same time. More on that in a moment.Remember that a White House spokesman previously told the NYT, \u201cThe President did not speak with the Attorney General about this matter, and no White House official was authorized to speak with the Department of Justice on this matter.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London.____________________________From a note just published by Alec Phillips, a political economist at the firm:The tax reform debate is moving forward faster than we or most other observers expected. While there are a number of issues that could still slow it down, or stop it altogether, we believe the odds that tax reform will be enacted by early 2018 \u2014 already our base case \u2014 have risen to 80% (from 65% previously).He added that there\u2019s a one-in-three chance of a tax change becoming law by the end of the year, though the House and Senate may need time to reconcile their bills.While Mr. Phillips thinks that Republicans\u2019 tax efforts still face obstacles, including intense lobbying efforts and questions about whether the Senate can pass its bill, he believes that the overall campaign will succeed.Among some of Mr. Phillips\u2019 other predictions:\u2022 The corporate tax rate appears likely to go down to 20 percent, but may need to be phased in.\u2022 Limits on deductions for corporate interest payments should follow the more lenient prescription set out in the House bill.\u2022 Fewer Republicans than expected will ultimately push back against limits on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT in Congressional parlance.\u2014 MichaelSenator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, had pushed for the mandate to be eliminated as part of the tax bill. Here\u2019s what he had to say:\u201cRepealing the mandate pays for more tax cuts for working families and protects them from being fined by the I.R.S. for not being able to afford insurance that Obamacare made unaffordable in the first place.\u201dMr. El-Erian has the qualifications: former C.E.O. of Pimco, currently chief economic adviser at Allianz.

It brings a highly respected, well-informed and experienced professional to the helm of the world\u2019s most powerful central bank.\u2014 MichaelThe S.E.C. filed a total of 62 new enforcement actions against public companies and their subsidiaries in the fiscal year, down from 92 the previous fiscal year.Of the 62 actions, only 17 were brought in the second half of the year.Trian Partners probably wishes you didn\u2019t.At the time Trian published its analysis, G.E. was trading at $25.47.

Who knows whether sticking to Trian\u2019s plan would have avoided this?)As of early this afternoon, the company\u2019s stock price was at $17.50, down 8 percent for the day.\u2014 MichaelSome start-up employees could owe big tax bills without being able to pay, since privately held companies\u2019 shares are generally harder to sell. Bigger unicorns could draw money from outside investors to let employees cash out \u2014 Uber already has \u2014 but younger start-ups have no such recourse.Companies could pay more cash compensation, using up precious cash flow. Or they could go public \u2014 if they make it that far.

{"Headline": "Luxury in a Turbulent World: What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat\u2019s next?There are more than 20 books on Amazon with those two words in the title (and subtitles like \u201cBritain\u2019s Future in Europe,\u201d \u201cCreativity in the Age of Entertainment,\u201d \u201cDispatches on the Future of Science\u201d and \u201cThe Smart Nurse\u2019s Guide to Your Dream Job\u201d).They are, in other words, two words that act as shorthand for the bundle of anticipation, expectation and disruption that is our understanding of the future.But when it comes to luxury, once upon a time they also had a very specific meaning. They encapsulated the driving force of creativity: the constant quest for new ways of seeing, new ways of working, new ways of crafting and expressing identity, new ways of being relevant in the world. They were the causal root of trends, and they paved catwalks; they were the subtext of seasons, and the theory behind thinking six months in the future.Ask designers what they are thinking about when they begin collections, for example, and the answers come back as variations of \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d. What fabric, what color, what silhouette, what hem length? What movie or book or television series that captures the popular imagination and changes how consumers want to dress? When we talk about the \u201czeitgeist\u201d and \u201cdirectional items,\u201d that\u2019s what we mean. Luxury is an exercise in projection, and a guess about what\u2019s next. There is always risk involved, but to opt out of the game is to relinquish the urgency that hooks consumers.So what\u2019s new about that? (To change it up a bit.)The fact that over the last few years \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d has also begun to mean something more in the fashion world. It has become a stand-in for the constant need for newness driven by technology and 24-hour communication; a nod to the need to speed deliveries and communications, to systematically rethink the interface between customer and company. What and when are the next product drops? The next Instagram story or newsletter?And coloring it all is the macro meaning: the groan with which people greet every news alert on their phones, the feeling of nauseous anticipation that arises upon every new headline. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d meant in reference to the seemingly unpredictable course of global events: What new natural disaster is about to hit; what unexpected political event will unfold; what tweet will send ripples around the globe? What will fall from the sky to unsettle the consumer, disrupt exchange rates and demand new corporate strategy?Because these many layers of meaning cannot be disaggregated. People do not make purchases in a vacuum.They buy because they want to feel better, or they don\u2019t buy because they are scared; or they do buy because exchange rates have fallen and suddenly everything is cheaper, or they don\u2019t buy because it is more expensive; or they do buy because, well, time to make hay while the sun shines (or before the bombs fall), or they don\u2019t buy because what they see seems irrelevant to their lives. What happens next in the world changes what needs to come next in luxury. And the tension between those poles is what defines decision-making today.So we asked a series of decision-makers to tell us \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d Here are their answers.The luxury landscape has been changing for quite a while now and the element that has become most apparent is how it has gone from a brand-driven industry to a product-driven one. Brands can no longer rely solely on their image, positioning and status: this means that the offer and the entire productivity chain (from how the products are conceived and produced to the way they are communicated and sold), needs to adapt and be consistent with these changes.Sustainability, flexibility, responsibility, quality and engagement will be even more important than they are today. They will determine the success of a company in ways beyond what we already can foresee and, most importantly, they will give it the right language and attitude to connect to the new generation of luxury consumers.It is likely that others have more data and insight than I do about macro factors and industrywide challenges or focus. Although guided by my belief that surviving and thriving in the next few years cannot be by business-as-usual, my expertise is in leadership. And that will be the greatest challenge.So, which C.E.O.s and senior team direct reports will succeed and which will falter?1. Successful leaders will bring all their capacities to the playing field.\u2014 Those who falter will fail to challenge their own strongly held belief that is untrue or no longer true.\u2014 Those who falter will suffer a fear that drives avoidance of necessary actions or risk-taking and will let ego and emotion dwarf their own intuition.2. Successful ones will bring all the resources in their ecosystem to bear.\u2014 Those who falter will be afraid to delegate to capable subordinates, will react negatively to thoughtful pushback.\u2014 Those who falter will avoid engaging outside resources to help, claiming frugality or confidentiality.\u2014 Those who falter will have no external personal board of directors.3. Successful ones will stay focused on the end game.\u2014 Those who falter will get stuck in the details, overwhelmed, distracted by the \u201cshiny new object.\u201d\u2014 Those who falter will stay tactical and short term, preserving the status quo or past.\u2014 Those who falter will have an undisciplined involvement in nonstrategic activities, starving time from what only the C.E.O. can doWhether it is a coach, an outside mentor, a trusted H.R. chief, the only way humans become aware of these possibly temporary troubled mind-sets is to look in the mirror through someone else\u2019s lens.Building an environment that fosters excellence to its full potential across each company\u2019s department should remain the focus, while making sure we live in our era and stay relevant.Uncertain circumstances cannot affect a culture of excellence driven by talent, creativity and passion.These core values will keep fashion relevant as well as the obsession to guarantee an authentic experience.In a sense, luxury\u2019s greatest challenge is the same as it ever was: to be more and more relevant to customers and the way they lead their lives.Having said that, distinctions once critical to our engagement with customers seem less and less relevant. Lines between wholesale and direct-to-consumer trade, domestic and international business, physical and digital storefronts are increasingly blurred.In a crowded and transparent marketplace, we need to be constantly \u201ctop of mind\u201d with our customers without seeming ubiquitous. Given all this, our greatest new focus will be increased personalization and customization of everything from product to content.To engage with a brand in a uniquely personal way is the ultimate luxury.The world challenges include the climate, growing inequality, the aspiration for diversity, the rejection of a \u201cone size fits all\u201d global model, the re-emergence of identities, individualities, the aspiration for a more responsible consumption, the aspiration for a more feminine world.A more feminine world is a world which gives birth to new and beautiful ideas for sustainable growth, it is also a world which takes care of all individuals who feel disengaged.Therefore the luxury industry will continue to protect the welfare of all people participating in the creation, production and promotion of its products, will protect the environment while improving the traceability of its sourcing and will continue to pay attention to animal welfare. Finally, the role of the most accomplished brands will be to support and serve a larger community than just its clientele by encouraging the community towards a certain mission. Most brands carry missions which go beyond its products; e.g., Nike will encourage audacity, \u201cJust do it!\u201d Apple, simplicity and Chlo\u00e9, \u201c freedom to be oneself.\u201dBeyond a global rise in austerity and digital disruption, the key challenge facing luxury brands is how to keep up with the unprecedented pace of the ever-evolving new luxury consumer. Unlike the previous generation who was romanced by the store experience and stories of craftsmanship, today\u2019s consumer is turned off by the very word \u201cluxury.\u201d For them the term has connotations of elitism and exclusivity. Instead, they want a luxury that is inclusive, honest and democratic.For the new consumer, status is no longer about how much you can afford to spend on a good, but more about what you stand for and have achieved. They know how to acquire \u201cluxury-quality\u201d at a fraction of the price and seek to be entertained beyond the store and within the digital space. Their first point of contact with a brand is usually via the website or social media channel, which makes it imperative for brands to consider these channels as platforms for information and entertainment and not just commerce. They want brands to care about the values that are important to them such as sustainability.To keep ahead of this demand, luxury brands will have to focus on how best to enhance the digital experience. Will the advent of new technologies such as A.R. (augmented reality) create a new experience in personalization whereby the brand atelier can be brought into people\u2019s homes?Of great focus in the coming years will be the integration of luxury into everyday life, which will necessitate design inspired by function as well as beauty and craftsmanship. Further, with more understanding of the impact of our purchases \u2014 and in the case of luxury goods, the artisans who made them and the provenance of the materials \u2014 we\u2019ll need greater transparency and storytelling on how our products came to be. Finally, we\u2019ll see more and more personalization to reflect individual style, and a continued need to serve consumers seamlessly wherever they are.The history or the moment of luxury has always been turbulent.It has been turbulent for luxury to become an industry, and a very dynamic one, quite young still \u2014 more or less 40 years.It has been turbulent for luxury to become international.It has been turbulent for luxury to embrace many different products under the same \u201cumbrella\u201d (brands) and layers of clients (consumers).It is turbulent for luxury to cope with quantities, and now, as well, with different generations of people from different cultures.It is challenging to cope with confusion.Too many adjectives are tied to the word \u201cluxury\u201d: Accessible, ultimate, soft, hard \u2014 implying that most of luxury would be average?The simple word luxury itself is often misused (not to say mess-used) covering brands, products, or processes irrelevant to the necessary evolution of our society and our world.The challenge, though, is inspiring \u2014 and necessary in order to stay, or become, right.The answer is not to try to protect or come back to a better yesterday (which day?) nor to follow current trends where statements replace thinking and thoughts, where number of followers have more value than what you propose, or where thinking that \u201cdigital\u201d will be a new world, when in fact there is only one world.We must accept and value complexity, and take uncertainty as a teaser to do better.Luxury has all the means to be a major reference as soon as it really mixes, in a sustainable way, legacy, know how, innovation, creativity, quality, beauty, fun, the unexpected, in concrete products and offers, always with the sense of integrity (towards itself) and the sense of respect (towards others).The beauty is that it is not about size but about strength.Besides, there is not one recipe, but several paths.That is why solid brands exist with their intangible substance and a long-term view.In an increasingly fast-paced world with more transparency than ever before, the need for continuous innovation and authenticity is paramount. Brands will continually have to balance innovation with authenticity to their D.N.A., especially in a time of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. This tension has always been present but is magnified with the power and transparency afforded by technology.After many years of attempted focus on all things digital, brands are realizing that consumers demand differentiated experiences across channels and we will continue to see innovation in brick-and-mortar store experiences as well as product co-creation with consumers (personalization and customization) taken to new levels.In a turbulent world with a widening divide between the have and have-nots, sustainability in luxury will move from being a \u201cnice to have\u201d to a \u201cmust have.\u201dThe new luxury will create heirlooms of gratifying value while simultaneously sustaining long-term economic, equitable and ecological values.One of the industry\u2019s main challenges is undoubtedly the emergence of a new generation of consumers, with unique sets of behaviors and expectations. Millennials, who are accustomed to very high standards of end-to-end service in other industries, will soon become its most important cohort of luxury clients and will put pressure on the traditional models. These \u201cdigital natives\u201d consumers follow very different and fragmented decision journeys and are amassing more and more power relative to the brands. Yet, many luxury players fall short of offering them an enriched, personalized, seamless and digitally enabled experience able to conquer their hearts and minds.Through innovation and utmost personalization, brands must shape the 21st century luxury experience. They should leverage their unique assets and brand heritages but also reinvent their in-store experiences, with the help of new technology, and transpose them online. This calls for a complete shift of luxury brands\u2019 approach to emotionally engage with their customers, starting by using data to provide a tailor-made experience across all touchpoints.While intelligence in business and in the world at large has changed exponentially, let\u2019s never forget that brands are created by people for people. The game-changer will be when we look at what we can achieve collaboratively and collectively as much as we what we do individually. We are in a new Renaissance, and it\u2019s our responsibility to play a role in how business, culture, humanity and science come together as never before.The concept of luxury has been around for centuries, not only in physical products and experiences but also in people\u2019s dreams. Today, luxury is not just about price. It means different things to different people. For some, it\u2019s about having the best. For some, it\u2019s about having better. It\u2019s not enough for a brand to create a single definition of luxury \u2014 it has to be more democratic than that.Going forward, we won\u2019t be able to define the luxury consumer based simply on demographics and income. We have to understand them much more personally, so that we can engage with consumers that care about what the brand stands for.And then we need to combine our creativity and state-of-the-art technology to create highly personalized experiences and products that make people feel special. I think that\u2019s what luxury really is. A feeling that something is special.The luxury Goods industry will need to manage with the fact that more and more disposable spending is now being spent on experiences rather than goods, as the cupboards are full and the garages are full and the affluent would now rather buy unique, memorable experiences.Traditionally, sustainability and luxury were opposites. Our key purpose at Soneva since we opened our first resort back in 1995 has been to prove that they are not, and that luxury and sustainability go hand in hand. At Soneva, we manage to offer our guests luxuries whilst minimizing our impact on the planet and enhancing their health.It is very good to see that over the last 10 years, other companies have adopted a similar belief, such as Kering. It is also good to see such revolutionary concepts like Tesla, which is not just as comfortable as a Merc, a Jaguar or a BMW, but also zero carbon in its operation.As we start to feel the impact of global warming and other environmental issues, low-impact consumption will become more and more important, especially for luxury brands.Success will come to those that keep a fresh, strong vision in design. This will put more pressure on the most creative designers to constantly reinvent themselves without losing continuity from a past season. Mid-tier luxury brands could disappear. U.S. luxury in particular will struggle unless designers reinvent themselves. Houses with a portfolio of brands in various states of reinvention will have a better chance of surviving than mono-brands.Luxury brands will create unique experiences in the retail world to entice and engage customers. Authenticity will win over flash or the slick branding of the early 2000s, which is still evident in most retail stores. Values will matter in fashion and integrating those values into the product lines will be really important \u2014 think Stella McCartney\u2019s commitment to sustainable fashion or Alessandro Michele and Gucci\u2019s recent commitment to be fur-free. Fashion\u2019s influence on culture will grow stronger, not weaker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Unveils an Electric Rival to Semi Trucks", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAWTHORNE, Calif. \u2014 Tesla has aimed to reinvent the automobile and the way electricity is generated for homes. With those efforts still in progress, it is setting out on another quest: to remake the multibillion-dollar trucking industry.In an elaborately produced nighttime presentation by its chief executive, Elon Musk, Tesla on Thursday unveiled a prototype for a battery-powered, nearly self-driving semi truck that the company said would prove more efficient and less costly to operate than the diesel trucks that now haul goods across the country. And of course, it will emit no exhaust.It has a top speed of at least 250 miles per hour, said Mr. Musk, dressed in a green canvas jacket and jeans.\u201cThe point of doing this is to give a hard-core smackdown to gasoline cars,\u201d he said to a cheering crowd of more than 2,000 people. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco and back.\u201dThe truck can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in five seconds without a trailer, and in 20 seconds when carrying a maximum load of 80,000 pounds, less than a third of the time required for a diesel truck, he said.Mr. Musk said Tesla expects to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019. He gave no price but hinted that it would be costly. \u201cTesla stuff is expensive,\u201d Mr. Musk said, drawing another cheer from the crowd, gathered at an airfield outside of Los Angeles.But he also said the electric truck would be less expensive to operate, in part because it has fewer components that require regular maintenance (no engine, transmission or drive shaft). Instead, the truck, called the Tesla Semi, is powered by a giant battery beneath the cab. It has two rear axles, each outfitted with two electric motors, one for each wheel. Its acceleration and uphill speeds will allow it to cover more distance in less time than diesel trucks, he added.As a result, Tesla is estimating it will cost $1.26 per mile to operate, compared with $1.51 a mile for a diesel truck. The cost can fall further \u2014 to 85 cents a mile, according to Tesla \u2014 if groups of trucks travel together in convoys, which reduces wind drag. \u201cThis beats rail,\u201d Mr. Musk said.Tesla said it had no partnerships to announce on the truck project at this point, but an early adopter emerged Friday when Walmart said it had ordered 15 test vehicles \u2014 five for its United States operations and 10 in Canada \u2014 for use when production begins. \u201cWe believe we can learn how this technology performs within our supply chain, as well as how it could help us meet some of our long-term sustainability goals, such as lowering emissions,\u201d said Ryan Curell, a Walmart spokesman.In typical Tesla fashion, the truck is a sharp departure from industry norms. The cabin is spacious enough for a driver and passenger to stand. The driver\u2019s seat is in the center of the cab, not on the left side. It is flanked by two laptop-size video screens providing navigation and scheduling data as well as images of blind spots and other areas around the truck.Autopilot can automatically steer, accelerate and brake for other vehicles and obstacles, although drivers must keep their eyes on the road and their hands on the steering wheel while using the feature.Tesla could face difficulty if it is unable to deliver on its promised range of 500 miles on a single charge. Analysts at Bernstein, an investment bank, estimated that Tesla\u2019s truck would be able to travel 300 to 450 miles a day before needing to recharge its battery pack. \u201cWe see 300 to 450 miles a day as a significant constraint,\u201d the bank said in a research report.Mr. Musk said Tesla envisions building a network of superchargers for trucks across the United States and other countries. He gave few details but said they would be solar-powered. \u201cSo your truck will be running on sunshine,\u201d he said.When Model 3 production started in July at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, Calif., Mr. Musk said he hoped to increase output to 20,000 vehicles a month by December. But Tesla had assembled just 260 by the end of September.The Model 3, with a starting price of $35,000, is intended to become Tesla\u2019s top-selling car. The company\u2019s other vehicles \u2014 the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X, a sport utility vehicle \u2014 sell for $70,000 and up. Last year, Tesla made about 85,000 vehicles, and it is on track to make about 100,000 this year.Because the Model 3, with its lower price, will appeal to a wider class of consumers, Mr. Musk is hoping to push sales to more than 500,000 cars in 2018.So far, the company has attributed the slow pace of Model 3 output to difficulties in producing battery packs at its Nevada plant, called the Gigafactory. It also said welding processes and final assembly tasks in the Fremont factory were moving more slowly than other parts of the manufacturing system.\u201cI think the electric, autonomous truck market is a very promising proposition,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Autotrader.com. \u201cOne of my concerns with Tesla is they have way too much on their plate. They can\u2019t over-promise and under-deliver on a truck.\u201dWhile Tesla jumped out ahead of established automakers with its electric cars and technologies like its Autopilot system, it faces a much different landscape in trucks, Ms. Krebs said.Tesla doesn\u2019t have experience in the truck market, and it is up against formidable competitors, like Daimler, that have a built-in customer base, she said.\u201cThe critical thing with trucks is that it is a work tool,\u201d she added. \u201cIt has to work all the time. It\u2019s not like a sports car and I have something else in the garage to drive if it\u2019s in maintenance or whatever.\u201dMichael Corkery contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Dangerous Sprint Into the Future", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "To hear its executives tell it, Tesla is misunderstood because it is still perceived as a car manufacturer, when its goals are more complex and far-reaching. But at least some people have bought into these grand ambitions. This summer, Tesla\u2019s stock-market valuation at times rose above those of Ford and General Motors, and its worth exceeded $60 billion. It did not seem to matter to investors that the company had never made an annual profit, had missed its production targets repeatedly and had become enmeshed in controversy over its self-driving \u201cautopilot\u201d technologies, or that Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, had conceded that the value of his company, of which he owns about 22 percent, was \u201chigher than we have the right to deserve.\u201d Tesla was a headlong bet on the future, a huge wager on the idea of a better world. And its secretive Gigafactory was the arsenal for a full-fledged attack on the incumbent powers of the car and fossil-fuel industries. The factory would help validate Musk and his company\u2019s seriousness about leading humanity\u2019s turn to greener technologies, with a vision now encompassing solar roofing tiles and battery packs for home and industry. Most crucial, it involved producing millions of Tesla cars and trucks, all of which would be sleek, electric and self-driving.If ambitions were all it took, Tesla would be crowned the colossus of the global car industry. But rapidly accelerating new technologies have brought uncertainty as well. Automakers are encountering three destabilizing forces all at once: automation, electrification and sharing. And sizing up which companies will be the winners and losers in their wakes is in no way obvious. In terms of self-driving cars, it seems likely that long-established companies \u2014 General Motors and Ford, as well as BMW and Audi \u2014 will benefit from their substantial reserves of cash and deep manufacturing experience. Because these automakers can invest deeply in research (and spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy start-ups), they can remain competitive with companies less inherently cautious, like Tesla and Waymo, the spinoff of Google\u2019s self-driving projects.Tesla\u2019s goal has always been focused on going green, rather than creating the driverless future. (Its mission is emblazoned on its factory walls: \u201cTo accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.\u201d) Yet as the automobile industry settles on the consensus that self-driving cars are coming \u2014 their promise to improve safety and to help ride-sharing replace car ownership for many Americans propels their inevitability \u2014 Tesla finds itself in the midst of a contest to do both. This set of challenges should be enough for any company, especially one led by a chief executive whose time is compromised by other business commitments as a founder of a rocket company (SpaceX), a new tunneling operation (the Boring Company), a company planning a human-computer interface (Neuralink) and a nonprofit focused on the dangers of artificial intelligence (OpenAI). But Tesla has given itself a few others too. One is to essentially reinvent modern manufacturing processes at the Gigafactory. Yet another is to create the first mass-market electric car ever. In the meantime, a company that has never made much profit needs to somehow figure out how to do so \u2014 that is, to put itself in the black before financial losses and missed deadlines curdle any hope that Tesla inspires, among customers or stockholders, into skepticism.Still, the Gigafactory is considerably more than a battery factory: It\u2019s the physical embodiment of various technological breakthroughs the company \u2014 which just manufactured its 250,000th car \u2014 is trying to bring to its cars and energy-storage systems. Tesla makes motors here for its new Model 3 car, for instance, which are then trucked to its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., 240 miles away. When we went inside, after a labyrinthine walk through offices and up and down stairways, we reached a rapidly moving automated factory line, where batteries were being installed into Powerwalls and Powerpacks \u2014 the residential and industrial units that store energy collected from solar panels (or any electrical generator). Later in the month, devices like these would make their way to Puerto Rico, where Tesla rebuilt the power infrastructure for a children\u2019s hospital, and southern Australia, where the company is involved in a vast public project to shore up the country\u2019s electrical grid. \u201cWe think of this building as a product, because it is a product,\u201d my guide told me as we walked alongside a production line. Every machine had been scrutinized, every inch mapped out, every efficiency contemplated. Tesla had taken the highly unusual step of setting up a separate entity to take full control of the building\u2019s design, engineering and construction, reflecting Tesla\u2019s D.I.Y. ethos to achieve levels of vertical ownership and quality control that its executives believe are unreachable otherwise. The company had even concocted its own Tesla blend of coffee to serve near its cafeterias. \u201cIf we cannot get exactly what we want from the world,\u201d one executive told me, \u201cthen we have to go do it ourselves.\u201dTesla\u2019s grand plans in many respects depend on how much innovation the company can bring to the process of battery making. If the Gigafactory succeeds in reducing costs \u2014 one battery-industry analyst, Sam Jaffe, the director at Cairn Energy Research Advisors, told me he thinks the company should be able to drive down the price of its cells by 30 percent \u2014 multiple dividends will accrue to Tesla. Cheaper batteries mean more than cheaper cars. They mean Tesla can put larger battery packs into cars for the same cost, increasing the vehicles\u2019 range, power and appeal compared with the competition. At the same time, they could make its home energy-storage systems more efficient. Tesla could also gain an advantage in the race to produce autonomous vehicles, or A.V.s. The electric vehicles, or E.V.s, that Tesla wants to make autonomous have zero emissions. If self-driving cars go on rotation, say, in Uber and Lyft fleets, they could run 24-7, possibly leading to more cars on the road. \u201cOne of the concerns about automation is that it\u2019s going to drastically increase the miles we drive,\u201d Stephen Zoepf, the executive director at the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, told me. \u201cSo if we expect as a society that we\u2019re going to be driving a lot more, we obviously want to mitigate the environmental impact.\u201dAt the Gigafactory, J.B. Straubel, a Tesla founder and the company\u2019s chief technology officer, recounted the plant\u2019s origin story. In 2012, he did a back-of-the-envelope calculation and realized that if Tesla were to sell something on the order of 500,000 cars a year, it would require the world\u2019s entire output of lithium-ion batteries at the time. \u201cWe realized, holy crap, this means we need a huge factory,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause there was no way to do this just by putting in an order with some cell company and have them ship a few more.\u201d His projections were not far off. When we met in September, orders for the Model 3, which began production in midyear and has been billed as the company\u2019s first mass-market car, were around 455,000 through July, suggesting that the demand for E.V.s is far larger than any of the traditional automakers ever imagined. In the future, Straubel told me, Tesla plans to put up many more Gigafactories around the world, \u201cones that are actually quite a lot bigger than this one\u201d \u2014 and it would construct those itself too. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a big building that\u2019s full of equipment,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea here of the machine that builds the machine, and it\u2019s really true. This place is the embodiment of that.\u201dThe impression he wanted me to have, I think, was that Tesla, once it gets this prodigious machine humming, will become robotically unstoppable at cranking out smaller machines, a great big clean-energy perpetual-motion device. At the same time, the company\u2019s executives, from Straubel and Musk on down, were urging potential customers not to view each Tesla product in isolation but as parts of an ecosystem. The Tesla customer could soon use Tesla solar roof tiles during the day to charge up a Tesla Powerwall unit, filled with Gigafactory-made batteries \u2014 at night the Powerwall could in turn recharge the Tesla sedan. Perhaps the customer very much liked to drive? In that case, he or she might occasionally stop at one of the hundreds of Tesla \u201csupercharger\u201d stations in cities or along highways. Or maybe the owner didn\u2019t like to drive at all and preferred to be driven automatically. Tesla would soon straddle our peculiar moment, the transitional era where humans begin to take their hands off their machines. \u201cEvery car made since October of last year,\u201d Musk promised in early August, \u201cis capable of full autonomy, we believe.\u201dField quickly showed me the controls. There weren\u2019t many except for a few dials on the steering wheel. The screen to its right served as the car\u2019s dashboard. \u201cThis looks forward to an era of autonomy,\u201d Field explained, \u201cbut it\u2019s also simpler and easier to manufacture.\u201d That meant cheaper too, which was crucial: Tesla had concluded that every dollar saved on the cost of making the car would mean 100 more families could buy it in a year. As we drove through Palo Alto, the car was nimble and responsive, with the same kind of leaping acceleration that characterizes the Model S. But it took some time to get used to checking the screen to my right for my speed and autopilot settings. Field told me his team had concluded that it would be natural and intuitive for a younger generation. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting when you put young people in the car,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the way all kids navigate technology.\u201d It\u2019s also possible that the kids might do more navigating, or giving the car orders, than driving. Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla\u2019s design chief, later told me that in creating the car\u2019s interior, he faced the question of making a car that was affordable and stylish but also relevant for a future era. There was vigorous debate within the company about what to do if the Model 3 became truly autonomous. As time went on, von Holzhausen\u2019s group reasoned, this car would be driven less and would be driving more. Thus the decision to jettison dials and controls made sense, because the need for driver information would be reduced, and the central screen could mark routes and arrival times and double as an entertainment center. Those would be the essential tools. Or, as von Holzhausen put it, \u201cThe screen then became the hero of the vehicle.\u201dAll of Tesla\u2019s cars, including the Model 3, come with cameras and sensors; the sensors are small radar and ultrasonic devices situated around the car\u2019s exterior that could enable it, presuming the right software is eventually developed, to become self-driving. Because each Tesla car maintains a cellular connection, over-the-air improvements dispensed by the company are a regular feature \u2014 tweaking acceleration or braking capabilities through uploaded instructions, for instance. Sometimes the extent to which the company can improve or alter its cars\u2019 performance, even years after they left the factory, can be startling or unsettling, as was the case when Tesla temporarily extended the battery range for some drivers fleeing Hurricane Irma in Florida this summer. Self-driving, which Field assured me would ultimately come to pass with the right software and which Musk has repeatedly promoted to investors and customers, would allow Teslas to become something much more than they are. In the parlance of the Society of Automotive Engineers, which has quantified the capabilities a car must have to be considered self-driving, the vehicles will have nearly attained Level 5. This level denotes a safe and fully autonomous car that can operate in any place, and any conditions, without a driver.At the moment, Teslas are at Level 2. Their cameras, sensors and software support a more modest capability known as \u201cenhanced autopilot,\u201d which costs an additional $5,000 in a new Model S or Model 3. In certain road and weather conditions, the cars can regulate speed and braking in traffic, steer automatically, change lanes and parallel park autonomously. By some industry rankings, these features now help make Teslas among the safest cars on the road. But following the deadly crash of a Model S driver who was using autopilot in Florida in May 2016, the company reconfigured what the cars permit. When I tried the automated steering on my Model S during the drive from Reno to Palo Alto, for instance, the car chimed frequently in distress and warned me through a dashboard notice when I took my hands off the wheel for a few seconds. I\u2019d been informed that if this happened three times, the car would slow down, stop and rescind my autopilot privileges altogether. I didn\u2019t push it. Clearly, the car \u2014 and Tesla, too \u2014 still needed its driver.In the summer of 2016, Musk updated his vision for the company \u2014 \u201cMaster Plan, Part Deux.\u201d In the decade since Part 1, the acceptance of electric vehicles had grown to the point where some traditional carmakers, in a surprising turn, were beginning to speak of an inevitable transition to an era when all models were battery-powered. Entire countries (like China) and enormous markets (like California) were also considering eventual bans on internal-combustion engines. As E.V. technology seemed ascendant, a variety of factors outside the auto industry were creating real potential for self-driving vehicles: great gains in computer-processing power, cheaper hardware sensors, better mobile connectivity, advances in artificial intelligence and enhanced mapping software. In his updated master plan, Musk stated that every Tesla would now have self-driving capabilities and that the application of \u201cfleet learning\u201d \u2014 a variation on machine learning \u2014 would help the company someday deliver a car that was 10 times safer in self-driving mode than when controlled by a human.Musk also explained a new fundamental goal of the company. Tesla, he said, wanted to \u201cenable your car to make money for you when you aren\u2019t using it.\u201d In other words, any new Tesla could in due time be part of a sharing network, able to taxi strangers around while its owner worked, slept or did whatever. Most Americans\u2019 cars stay parked about 95 percent of the time. A Tesla would not. In the same way that Tesla\u2019s electric drive train made the American car more efficient, the Tesla network would make the total utilization of the vehicle more efficient, too.App-based sharing networks for cars already exist: These companies \u2014 Turo and Getaround, for instance \u2014 are different from, say, Zipcar, because they depend on peer-to-peer communications to arrange for rentals. In essence, they function like mobile Airbnbs, and in some cases have drawn the ire of users in the wake of driver crashes and insurance issues. A Tesla network would push this concept much further, involving perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of cars, all of them already connected to the internet. Yet such a business network, one Tesla executive told me, most likely wouldn\u2019t succeed unless Tesla\u2019s cars were fully autonomous. Any concerns about insurance and lending a car to a risky driver would disappear, he argued, if autonomous driving proves to be much safer than manual driving. Just as important, autonomy makes irrelevant the problem of getting the car to where it\u2019s needed next \u2014 it can be sent wherever it needs to go via mobile app. What\u2019s crucial here is that the Tesla network, if it becomes functional, can defray the cost of an electric car like the Model 3, which is billed as Tesla\u2019s affordable car but can easily surpass $50,000 with various options. If your car is making money for you when you\u2019re not using it, it effectively becomes a tool that uses the virtues of A.V.s to promote the market adoption of E.V.s.Over the course of several months, I often asked people at Tesla, as well as those working on autonomous technologies elsewhere, how far away the self-driving future might be. There was no solid consensus beyond somewhere between two and five years. I tended to believe that the timeline might extend much further and would depend on how tightly we regulate such vehicles and how we agree to define autonomy. Does it mean interstate driving on a sunny day? Or driving within a dedicated area on city streets? Is it a Level 5 overnight trip through heavy rain from Boston to Washington? A driverless taxi pickup on a crowded street under partial construction \u2014 orange cones, backhoes, chaos \u2014 as a nightclub lets out? Part of the debate concerns hardware and whether the collection of sensors that automotive engineers now build into their A.V.s can collect enough data to create a fully autonomous car. These sensors generally include radar, cameras and Lidar, the expensive laser-based technology that Tesla has so far declined to use. Many other A.V. researchers consider it essential. Lidar uses light waves, rather than radio waves, to map and \u201cread\u201d a car\u2019s environs.Musk has promised that before the end of this year, a Tesla vehicle will drive itself coast to coast completely on autopilot. A number of competitors \u2014 especially Waymo and General Motors \u2014 seem to be closing in on similarly ambitious goals. But it\u2019s worth noting that no Level 5 car has ever been publicly deployed, and it\u2019s doubtful one even exists; the coast-to-coast trip on autopilot, Musk suggested, wouldn\u2019t yet be an instance where a driver could, say, go to sleep at the wheel. What\u2019s more, no Level 4 car, where the vehicle is self-driving under certain weather and geographical conditions, has been put in regular service, either. In fact, while driver-assistance tools like autopilot can greatly reduce crash rates, no company or researcher has ever demonstrated that a robotic automobile can consistently operate in the everyday world more safely than a car with a human driver.An executive close to Musk told me that his boss believes that creating a true A.V. is a \u201csolvable\u201d problem, one probably less difficult than others he has encountered in various business endeavors \u2014 for instance, creating cheap, reusable rockets for SpaceX, his other major company, or pushing Tesla\u2019s Model S to such unlikely success. This may indeed prove true. But unlike other tech innovations, the development of driverless cars cannot count on something like Moore\u2019s Law, which has projected a doubling of computing power at regular intervals and has allowed Silicon Valley entrepreneurs a clear window into the future. Based on conversations with engineers on the A.V. front lines, the most difficult problem is rigging cars with sensors and software that can take a rich, clear, picture of every element in the surrounding environment \u2014 people, bikes, signs, obstacles \u2014 and then algorithmically choreograph the future.This challenge is as arduous for Tesla as it is for engineers everywhere working to solve it. And yet the exigencies of Tesla\u2019s business model add an additional layer of complexity. To reach its sustainability goals and become profitable, the company must make lots of cars that are electric and sporty and increasingly affordable; meanwhile, to prepare for the future, Tesla has to build cars that eventually won\u2019t need us. Some of the most experienced researchers working on A.V.s believe that these are two separate and possibly irreconcilable ambitions and that it makes more sense to focus on a pure driverless car, even if it proves to be a very expensive proposition at first, rather than follow Tesla\u2019s incrementalist policy, which would involve rolling out software on a regular basis until the driver does less and less and finally nothing at all. With the second approach, one Silicon Valley engineer said, \u201cthe market pressures that are going to be applied to those technologies mean that you\u2019re not going to climb up the safety and reliability curve\u201d to build a true A.V. Keeping the vehicle affordable is in constant tension with making the vehicle autonomous. Musk\u2019s optimism alone can\u2019t change that.Musk declined my interview requests over the course of several months. By early November, the number of Model 3 cars coming out of the factory had fallen far short of what Musk had promised, the company\u2019s stock price had taken a nose-dive and there appeared to be serious software and robotic glitches at the Gigafactory. Musk was said to be too busy to talk, which did not always square with his social-media postings: jokes, poems, photos of tunnels he was digging, links to stories about the dangers of artificial intelligence and, in one instance, footage of a camping excursion on the roof of the Gigafactory.The company\u2019s evasiveness and secrecy extended to self-driving cars, a subject it was unwilling to discuss in any detail. One Tesla engineer I spoke with, who works on autopilot systems, maintained that the company\u2019s camera and sensory hardware will prove good enough to get his team where it wants to go, which as a near-term goal means cars with a self-driving capability that is twice as good as a human driver (rather than 10 times as good, per the second master plan). By November, Musk was telling investors that the actual goal was to get the system simply on a par with a human driver and that that might require a more powerful computer in the cars, which Tesla would swap in free if necessary. Some customers have already paid $3,000 for a Tesla \u201cself-driving\u201d package (on top of the $5,000 for \u201cenhanced autopilot\u201d), based on Musk\u2019s assurances that the new cars have all the hardware necessary and will be autonomous once regulations and functional software are worked out.There\u2019s no clear indication of whether these efforts are on track, and in the past year, several engineers who ran Tesla\u2019s autopilot unit have left the company. In early October, Scott Miller, an executive involved with General Motors\u2019 self-driving efforts, charged publicly that Musk was \u201cfull of crap\u201d for claiming that his cars could offer self-driving capabilities with their current hardware. His assertions echo those of some other Tesla critics I spoke with: Without Lidar, or a more expensive hardware approach, Musk\u2019s cars may be at a significant disadvantage. Indeed, several people familiar with the company\u2019s A.V. work viewed its self-driving approach as a perilous one, given that there is no definitive way to predict how long it could take Tesla to satisfy the promises made to customers. In the best case, if A.I. and software breakthroughs ultimately transform cars like the Model 3 into self-driving vehicles, Musk will have pulled off something that perhaps seems impossible today. In the worst case, hundreds of thousands of owners will have cars that won\u2019t achieve the status of true A.V.s and can only hope that the sharing network of the master plan will someday become a reality.Tesla\u2019s setbacks, Musk noted in November, shouldn\u2019t eclipse the fact that the company has already grown faster by some measures than Ford when it rolled out the Model T in the early 1900s. He takes a longer view of his business than Wall Street analysts. In a recent TED interview, while discussing his plans for cities on Mars, he argued that it\u2019s a mistake to assume that technology gets better as time goes on. \u201cIt does not automatically improve,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade.\u201d He cited the Egyptian pyramids and Roman aqueducts and how the knowledge to build them was lost for hundreds, or even thousands, of years afterward. The relevance is striking in a time when the federal government would rather subsidize the growth of the coal and fossil-fuel industries than renewable energy and electric cars.Long before anyone saw Tesla as a legitimate player in the auto industry, Musk also appears to have understood that in taking chances that no established carmaker would, Tesla could be an innovative force to quicken our slow, plodding progress in transportation. Imagine Tesla didn\u2019t exist, Steve Jurvetson told me. \u201cWhat would the world look like? I have this sinking suspicion it wouldn\u2019t look that different than 10 years ago. A bunch of hybrid cars. A bunch of noise about hydrogen vehicles. You know, I don\u2019t think the world would look anything like today \u2014 where entire nations are saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to stop making gas cars.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe company\u2019s impact, real and potential, is all the more surprising considering that Musk has staked Tesla\u2019s success on the industrial equivalent of a shoestring, lacking the resources of established carmakers. He has used customer revenue, his own wealth, venture capital, bank and government loans, investments by other automakers and the American stock and debt markets to effectively fund a multibillion-dollar research-and-development project. In that way, he has led the industry to the start of a new era. And now his company, hindered by debilitating manufacturing bottlenecks and its extravagant promises of self-driving, is poised to find out whether, in laying the groundwork for an electric and autonomous future, he took one risk too many.Advertisement"}

And for many, that sense was heightened, early on, by food. \u201cWhen friends came over and it smelled like sour fishy things, it was weird,\u201d said Chase Valencia, a Filipino-American who runs Lasa in Los Angeles with his brother Chad. Niki Nakayama, the Japanese-American chef of n/naka in Los Angeles, remembers lifting the lid of her bento box in the school cafeteria to find little neck clams staring up at her, \u201cwith eyes it felt like,\u201d she said.Some chefs resisted the claims of their heritage. Corey Lee, the Korean-American chef of Benu in San Francisco, once threw out his mother\u2019s painstakingly made stores of kimchi when he was a teenager. Now he ferments his own kimchi at Benu \u2014 then transforms it into a membrane-thin, crispy glass to hold a single bite of pork belly and oyster.Is this \u201cauthentic\u201d? It\u2019s a question Asian-American chefs often have to field, as if \u201cwe\u2019ve been sullied by American culture,\u201d said Diep Tran, the chef of Good Girl Dinette, a Vietnamese diner in Los Angeles. More important to many chefs is a commitment to season and place: Chad Valencia of Lasa makes sinigang (a Filipino soup) with local rhubarb and pickled Fresno chile peppers. Preeti Mistry, whose Indian-inflected restaurants include Juhu Beach Club in Oakland, adds nectarine to her chaat sev puri in summer and sweet potato in the fall. \u201cWhen people ask what region of India the food is from, I say Oakland,\u201d she said.For Deuki Hong, who makes Korean fried chicken at Sunday Bird, a pop-up in San Francisco, the question of what to cook is entirely personal. \u201cI cook Korean food not because I have to or because it\u2019s my heritage,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to cook what I love to eat.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)After one of the wettest winters in state history, and with more rain expected on Wednesday, the drought may seem like a distant memory to many Californians. But in parts of the San Joaquin Valley, where the water shortage was felt most acutely, the recovery has been slow going.Now, more than three years later, state officials say they are almost done restoring residents\u2019 access to a reliable water supply. By the end of the year, they hope to have about 750 of East Porterville\u2019s 1,200 homes connected to a nearby city\u2019s water system. The remaining households have chosen to forgo a water bill and place faith in their wells once more.Doug Carlson, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said the agency was happy that so many residents have signed up for service. Officials, he noted, have been \u201cpushing hard to get these people connected so they never have to do without water again.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s the Grim Reality of Frequent Work Travel: Health Problems", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTheir lives may be portrayed as glamorous. In fact, they\u2019re often the opposite. Pity frequent business travelers.Lin Chen, the incoming president of the International Society of Travel Medicine and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said that jet lag, combined with a lack of access to exercise and fresh food while on the road and sporadic engagement at home, needs rigorous study. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s hard to know the impact because not enough research has been done,\u201d she said. \u201cBut certainly it\u2019s significant.\u201dDr. Cetron said the image of the jet-setter who flies around making million-dollar deals no longer reflects the experience of most business travelers. \u201cThe reality is that the full spectrum of the work force now travels. Not just C.E.O.s but the more modest businessperson \u2014 think of junior employees at multinational companies, or aid workers who are called to respond to international crises. Some of these people have to travel on really shoestring budgets.\u201d For them, flying business class or staying in fancy hotels is not an option.That study tracked the body mass index; levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, what\u2019s known as \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol; and self-rated healthiness of more than 13,000 business travelers. Dr. Rundle has just completed a follow-up study, and the new findings, currently under peer review, \u201care pretty much the same as the old ones,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is kind of like a U-shaped curve. People who travel the most and people who don\u2019t travel at all have the worst health.\u201dAn explanation for nontravelers\u2019 poor health may be that chronic conditions prevent them from boarding planes in the first place, he said. The culprits of the poor health among constant travelers are the usual suspects: bad airport food, uneven exercise habits and jet lag. If there is a sweet spot, Dr. Rundle said, it may be with those who travel for work only a few times a year.What they found in the initial study was that the average body mass index of travelers who are on the road 21 or more nights a month was higher than in travelers who were away from home one to six nights per month. For a 6-foot-tall person, the difference amounted to a 10-pound difference in weight.That finding supports what Dr. Rundle said he suspected was a problem for traveling employees. \u201cIf you\u2019re in your 30s and you\u2019re traveling a lot and you\u2019re eating poorly and you have poor access to physical activity, that starts to catch up with you,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the next 10 years or so, the consequences start to become things like high blood pressure and diabetes and obesity. Long-term chronic issues.\u201dHis yet-unpublished sequel study looks more closely at business travelers\u2019 mental health \u2014 an area both Dr. Cetron at the C.D.C. and Dr. Chen at the International Society of Travel Medicine said was important but fell outside their purview. It includes factors like alcohol abuse and accidents and injuries caused by lack of sleep and jet lag. \u201cThese are things that can have really immediate consequences for yourself and your career,\u201d he said.\u201cA lot of times, I\u2019ll have people come in and say, \u2018I was in so-and-so country, and I think I have a sinus infection,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThen when I close the door to the exam room, they\u2019ll burst out crying. They made the appointment ostensibly for a sinus infection, but they\u2019re so tired and worn out from traveling that they just need to see someone and talk about it. They don\u2019t want to share it with their business because they\u2019re concerned about walking up the corporate ladder and their ability to succeed.\u201dSharing tales of travel weariness at home may not be an option, either.\u201cI\u2019ll hear things like, \u2018My kid had a performance last week and my husband\u2019s upset with me because I wasn\u2019t there,\u2019 or \u2018I can\u2019t do this any more and I don\u2019t know how to tell my family,\u2019\u201d Dr. Kozarsky said. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving people at home who are not happy you\u2019re gone for a number of reasons, and when you get home you\u2019re trying to catch up on all the things that happened while you were gone, but all you can think about is how tired you are. The only thing you can do as a doctor is to reassure them, to give people permission to feel the way they\u2019re feeling.\u201dSuch a break would set off its own work-related stressors, though, he said.And that is in keeping with what Dr. Cetron of the C.D.C. has been seeing.\u201cThings are merging and changing in the world of business travel,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether trips are frequent short ones or long ones, the intensity of travel schedules is putting people under a lot of pressure.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Eases Limits on Foreign Stakes in Financial Firms", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Hours after President Trump left China with a warning about its trade practices, Beijing threw him \u2014 and Wall Street \u2014 a bone.The Chinese government said on Friday that it would relax or remove a broad range of limits on foreign ownership of banks and securities firms. The move could inject a little foreign know-how into a vast financial system that helped fuel China\u2019s economic rise but that in recent years has become burdened with debt, bubbles and inefficiencies.Foreign firms may not rush in right away. Global financial institutions have been cautious about investing in China, partly because they would be required to buy mostly Chinese-made telecommunications equipment for their operations here and to store financial data here as part of the country\u2019s tough new cybersecurity laws.Still, the Chinese initiative could help Beijing rally political support from Wall Street banks and securities firms, which have profited from fees on Chinese purchases of American companies but have long been limited in what they could do inside China.Goldman Sachs Group praised the Chinese move, saying, \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s announcement and look forward to playing a greater role in China\u2019s capital markets.\u201dChina keeps tight limits on a number of industries it considers vital, including energy, transportation, the media and financial services. Companies in the United States, Europe and Japan have increasingly complained about being limited in those markets or shut out entirely, even as Chinese companies make their own investments in similar industries outside its borders. In many cases, Beijing\u2019s limits have given rise to Chinese giants who dominate markets at home.Officials in Beijing had previously said the government would open the financial sector to outside money, but Friday\u2019s move offered the first concrete details.Zhu Guangyao, China\u2019s vice finance minister, said that his country would start allowing foreign investors to own 51 percent of Chinese securities firms, fund managers and futures companies, and would allow them to own 100 percent three years from now. The current limit on foreign ownership is 25 percent for large, publicly traded securities firms and 49 percent for most other businesses in these categories.Mr. Zhu said that China would also raise the allowed foreign investment in insurance companies, currently 50 percent for most companies, to 51 percent in three years and 100 percent in five years. China also plans to eliminate its current limit of 25 percent foreign ownership in banks, Mr. Zhu said, but he did not say when it might happen.While the moves were announced several hours after Mr. Trump and his advisers flew to Vietnam, Mr. Zhu said that the initiatives were the result of decisions made during the Communist Party\u2019s congress last month. Trump administration officials shied away from making commitments while in Beijing over market access, the sort of horse-trading that marked previous presidential visits. They have also been distracted by domestic issues and other trade issues.\u201cSpeaking over all, it is a good thing,\u201d said Liu Dongliang, an analyst at China Merchants Bank. \u201cThere will be more different kinds of capital involved, and their management ideas and risk control ideas may arouse some reaction.\u201dAmerican financial institutions cautiously welcomed the Chinese move. Citibank said that its existing operations in China were already growing, with more than $1 billion a year in China-related revenue, and that it wanted to study the details of the new regulations when they were released.China promised when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 that it would rapidly open up its financial markets to foreign competition. Foreign commercial banks were then disappointed when Chinese regulators set high capital requirements for each foreign bank branch, limiting their ability to expand.But the rise of online banking has reduced the need for bank branches, and so has the rise of electronic payments. Over the past couple of years, Citibank has been gradually closing some of its retail branches in China, as it has done in the United States. According to the bank, 95 percent of its retail banking transactions now take place outside bank branches.Yet foreign banks hold just 1.5 percent of the assets in China\u2019s credit-swollen banking system. State-owned banks have flooded credit markets with so many loans that finding large, financially stable, creditworthy borrowers has become harder in China, forcing newcomers to enter the treacherous market of providing loans to smaller enterprises at a time when the entire Chinese economy is gradually slowing.China\u2019s financial markets have a reputation for fraud and manipulation, particularly the stock market. Increasing the role of foreign firms in these markets could help introduce overseas practices that might limit misconduct.Asset management companies have already been expanding their role in China, and the new rules announced by Mr. Zhu could speed that process. Peter L. Alexander, the founder and managing director of Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai financial consulting firm, said that because Chinese investors tended to have large holdings in relatively simple money market funds and had not yet shown much interest in purchasing exchange-traded funds, \u201cthere\u2019s an opportunity for active managers.\u201dMr. Zhu also repeated on Friday a Chinese pledge made late Thursday to ease joint-venture requirements for electric cars and other so-called new energy vehicles that may be built in China\u2019s free-trade zones. Unlike any other large car manufacturing nation, China requires either that all cars sold within its borders be assembled in a 50-50 joint venture with a local partner or that an import tax of at least 25 percent be paid, plus a range of other taxes.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

For one group of residents, the region\u2019s homeless, the rains were more than just an inconvenience.Damp and cold conditions bring influenza and infections to the crowded tent encampments that have swelled in recent years as soaring property prices have sent more people onto the street.\u201cWe have camps where we can have 50 to 100 people living in proximity,\u201d said Dr. Jason Reinking, a medical doctor who focuses on the homeless as part of a program run by the Roots Community Health Center in Oakland. \u201cViruses or bacteria can spread quite aggressively.\u201dBut California has far more unsheltered homeless \u2014 around 66 percent of the state\u2019s homeless live on the streets. By comparison, in New York state, just 4 percent of homeless people are unsheltered.Dr. Reinking says the damp conditions outdoors are particularly dangerous for diabetics, who are more susceptible to foot infections that can sometimes become so severe they require amputation. He struggles to keep up with needs of his patients.\u201cHomelessness is an epidemic in California,\u201d Dr. Reinking said. \u201cWe are grossly understaffed and under-resourced to respond.\u201dWinters are of course not as extreme in Northern California compared with cities in the Midwest or New England.Oakland has winter shelters, which opened this week, but some homeless people are reluctant to use them because it means leaving their belongings behind, according to Lara Tannenbaum, the manager of Community Housing Services for the City of Oakland.The city also hands out hats, coats and blankets.At dusk on Thursday, groups of men and women huddled in camping tents under a freeway in Oakland, sheltered from the steady rain but not the dampness. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get warm,\u201d said Eugene Jacobs, 27, who has been homeless for the past three years. \u201cWe have to change clothes three or four times a day. Everything keeps getting wet.\u201d\u201cThis is going to be hard,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said about the onset of winter. \u201cAnd this is the least of it.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Yes, life has gotten pretty pricey in San Francisco.

The car is.Using a radar sensor, cameras, GPS positioning and a highly precise digital map, the CT6\u2019s Super Cruise driver-assistance system is handling all of the braking, accelerating and steering as I continue heading west to a lunch appointment in South Bend, Ind., 170 miles away.That leaves me free to sit back and type these words \u2014 and do much more that would otherwise be considered unsafe \u2014 as the mile markers zip by.Self-driving cars will soon be a reality. Waymo, the autonomous-car division of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is already testing hundreds of self-driving vehicles around the country. The ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft and big automakers including General Motors, Ford Motor and Audi are developing their own technology and test fleets.So on this brisk November day, my hands-free road trip with Super Cruise offered a glimpse into that future \u2014 a world in which the grinding daily commute will transform into quiet time, and long drives can become productive hours on the road.Super Cruise was introduced in September and is General Motors\u2019 answer to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, the best known of the semiautonomous driving systems that have arrived in the past two years. Neither Autopilot nor Super Cruise is fully autonomous \u2014 both require drivers to remain alert and prepared to take control at any time.But Super Cruise has one big advantage: Unlike Autopilot, it does not require you to keep your hands on the steering wheel. As I\u2019m typing this, a camera mounted on the steering column is monitoring my eyes and head. As long as I glance up every so often, Super Cruise knows that I\u2019m keeping an eye on the road.For more than an hour, Super Cruise pilots the car with no input from me \u2014 no steering, no braking and no acceleration. In that time, I cover 65 miles. With my hands free, I scroll through Twitter and Facebook. I log into my bank account and read the headlines from The New York Times.As long as I look up at the road about every three seconds, Super Cruise remains in command, maintaining a safe following distance and easing the Cadillac through the freeway\u2019s contours. When Super Cruise is engaged, a thin light strip on the top of the steering wheel appears green. If I look away longer than three seconds, it flashes to bring my gaze back on the highway. If I fail to do so, the light strip turns red and the driver\u2019s seat vibrates, telling me to take control.That has happened only once so far. To get Super Cruise back, I need only look forward and place my hands on the wheel. After a few seconds, the light strip turns green again, and my hands are free to go back to the iPhone.I quickly learn how to glance regularly at the road. My host in South Bend, my cousin Pat, calls me using the video chat function in Facebook Messenger. I hold the phone up over the steering wheel so that I can see Pat on the screen while keeping my gaze looking forward, ensuring Super Cruise remains in control.All the while, the CT6 stays centered in the left lane of I-94. But if I want to change lanes or to pass other cars, I take the wheel myself and steer the car over. The light strip turns blue, indicating I\u2019m temporarily overriding Super Cruise. Once the car is in the new lane, the strip goes back to green and I\u2019m hands-free again. It decelerates when approaching slower vehicles. When the road clears, it accelerates back up to the speed I\u2019ve selected: 74 m.p.h., four over the speed limit.At one point, a car merging onto the highway scoots in front of me. Super Cruise responds quickly and brakes. I sense no danger of a collision.G.M. is careful to specify that it is not promoting Super Cruise as a way to let drivers text, Google or open a newspaper on the highway. \u201cWe don\u2019t recommend it,\u201d said Lisa Sieradski, global product manager for the CT6. \u201cIt will allow you to glance down at a phone or the radio, but you have to return your eyes to the road.\u201dNonetheless, using the same video-chatting method, I watch a four-minute highlight video from a Rangers game. (They beat the Bruins, 4-2.) I also conduct a phone interview, taking notes with a pen and a pad. When my trip ended, I had covered 378 miles. My hands were on the wheel for no more than 25 of them.Ms. Sieradski said G.M. had tried to engineer Super Cruise to keep drivers safe \u2014 and limit opportunities to use the system improperly \u2014 by restricting how and where they could use it. The system will not operate at speeds above 85 mile per hour, for example.And Super Cruise can be activated only on divided, limited-access highways such as interstates \u2014 places where it need not contend with intersections, traffic lights and pedestrians. The system determines its exact location by relying on high-precision digital maps and GPS technology, while sensors track the surrounding traffic \u2014 the way sensors do for driver aides like adaptive cruise control. The system is able to determine when the car is on a service road along the highway, or even on entry and exit ramps \u2014 locations where it requires you to steer yourself.But when the Super Cruise system senses it is on an approved road, a white steering wheel icon appears on the instrument panel. Press a button, and the green bar lights up and the system takes over.For now, Super Cruise is available only on the 2018 CT6. Dealers in Michigan are offering the car with the option for about $73,000.The ability to cruise on the highway hands-free is a major step forward. For many drivers, systems that require them to keep their hands on the steering wheel seem almost self-defeating. What\u2019s the point of having the car steer itself if your hands have to stay on the wheel?While driving the CT6 over several days, I found it was actually more pleasing to leave my phone alone. One morning at rush hour, I sat quietly with my hands on my knees, sipping a latte as though I were relaxing on my couch.On the return leg of my South Bend trip, I turned on the back massager built into the CT6\u2019s driver\u2019s seat. From my phone, I piped a new-age meditation through the CT6\u2019s sound system.As I stared at the truck ahead of me, and the seat kneaded my lower back, I crossed the border into the state of Zen. The voice on the meditation intoned: \u201cYou are feeling relaxed and calm.\u201dFor two hours and 120 miles, I was.Advertisement"}

A young computer scientist from Manhattan. A financial worker from New Jersey. And 10 Argentine men in New York to celebrate their 30th high school reunion. Together they shared a bustling bicycle path along the Hudson River in Manhattan on a brisk, sunny Tuesday afternoon.The Argentine visitors bore the brunt of the bloodshed \u2014 five of the dead had traveled to New York from Rosario, a city northwest of Buenos Aires, to celebrate their 30th high school reunion. In all, six of the dead were tourists, underscoring New York City\u2019s role as a tourist mecca for people from all corners of the globe.The two other victims were from much closer \u2014 one lived just blocks from where he was killed. And Darren Drake, 32, lived with his parents across the Hudson River in a New Jersey suburb.Mr. Drake\u2019s father, Jimmy Drake, said it was routine for his son, a project manager at Moody\u2019s Analytics, to bike along the Hudson River during work breaks. He was fascinated by ancient history and would listen to Books on Tape as he pedaled, his father said.\u201cHe loved reading, he loved exercising on a bike, he loved his job,\u201d Mr. Drake said. \u201cHe loved his life.\u201dMr. Drake said his son graduated from Rutgers University, and later became a member of the school board in the town where he lived, New Milford, eventually serving as vice president. He was studying for another Master\u2019s degree, his father said. Every night, he returned home to have dinner with his parents, entertaining them with facts from his audiobooks.Above all, he loved vacationing on cruise ships, having gone on 14 voyages, Mr. Drake said. He had recently lost 93 pounds after lap-band surgery, overcoming his passion for all-you-can-eat cruise ship buffets and Italian food, he said. He also had a fondness for the lottery and casinos, his father said.\u201cHe was into everything that was either illegal, impractical or fattening,\u201d he said with a laugh.About 20 miles away from the Drake home, in Manhattan, reporters gathered in front of a large doorman building on Greenwich Street \u2014 the home of Nicholas Francis Cleves, who was also killed in the attack.\u201cNicholas was always happy and curious and helpful,\u201d he said.Mr. Cleves was a computer science major at Skidmore, and friends remembered his interest in video games and robotics.\u201cFrom a young age I have been deeply interested in computers, gadgets, video games, and programming as an art form,\u201d he wrote on LinkedIn.He added: \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been robbed.\u201dMr. Kassen said that Mr. Cleves had worked for Little Red Schoolhouse and Elisabeth Irwin after he went to Skidmore, helping with technical support. Mr. Cleves was at the school last Saturday, setting up computers for a meeting at the school, Mr. Kassen said.CX Design\u2019s website says that Richard Cleves arrived in New York and soon met Monica Missio, who was a neighbor on the Lower East Side. Eventually they moved to Greenwich Village, to a building close to where their son died.On Tuesday night, Argentine government officials identified the five victims who lived in Argentina as Hern\u00e1n Mendoza, Diego Angelini, Alejandro Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij and Hern\u00e1n Ferruchi, all of whom had graduated from the Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Superior in Rosario.The other victim was Ann-Laure Decadt, 31, of Belgium, who had come to New York with her mother and two sisters, according to her husband, Alexander Naessens, who shared information about his wife with Francesco Vanderjeugd, the mayor of Staden, a village south of Bruges where she lived.Mr. Naessens said he received a call from officials at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital less than an hour after the attack and was told that his wife had died. He said she was riding a bicycle near the Hudson River with her family when she was struck.\u201cThis loss is unbearable and incomprehensible,\u201d he said. She was \u201ca fantastic wife and the most wonderful mother of our two little sons of 3 months and 3 years old.\u201dShe worked for Ardo, a Belgian frozen food production company and worked with youth groups, the mayor said.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that someone who goes on a holiday can be taken out of life so brutally,\u201d Mr. Vanderjeugd said on Flemish radio.\u201cLooking at your son in a morgue, with the scars and black and blue,\u201d Jimmy Drake said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see my son of 32 years of age.

{"Headline": "G.M. Unveils Its Driverless Cars, Aiming to Lead the Pack", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For more than a year, General Motors has tantalized investors with plans to build its future around self-driving cars.It has regularly announced big investments and progress reports, but the company has kept its prototype vehicles largely under wraps \u2014 until now.On Thursday, G.M. will demonstrate its growing fleet of computer-operated, battery-powered Chevrolet Bolts in San Francisco to dozens of investment analysts, who are eager to evaluate the automaker\u2019s advanced test vehicles.The event represents a critical step for G.M. as it seeks to establish leadership in the hotly contested race to bring driverless cars to market.And although G.M. has been reluctant to show off the cars it has developed through a subsidiary, Cruise Automation, the company now wants to prove that self-driving models are getting closer to general use.\u201cEverything we are doing is geared to speed,\u201d G.M.\u2019s president, Daniel Ammann, told journalists at an event showcasing the cars on Tuesday.To emphasize the company\u2019s progress, Mr. Ammann said the cars would be ready for consumer applications in \u201cquarters, not years.\u201dMeeting that goal would probably give G.M., the nation\u2019s largest automaker, a jump on other companies developing self-driving models.Industry analysts say autonomous vehicles could generate billions of dollars in additional revenue and profit for automakers and technology companies, primarily by selling or leasing them to ride-hailing services, taxi fleets and delivery companies.For G.M., the self-driving program is a cornerstone to long-term growth that is not dependent on simply selling vehicles to individual drivers.\u201cG.M. has changed the narrative of the company\u2019s future,\u201d Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a research report on Tuesday.Other automakers, such as Ford Motor, Volkswagen and Toyota, are pushing to accelerate their own electric and autonomous-vehicle programs.The field is also crowded with competitors from Silicon Valley, such as Google, Apple, Uber and the electric-car maker Tesla.G.M. has a blend of financial resources, automotive experience and management resolve that position it strongly to compete with other automakers and big tech companies. But it also has a legacy of failures to overcome \u2014 none bigger than its collapse into bankruptcy in 2009.The scandal slowed G.M.\u2019s comeback, but it also galvanized its executives to focus on making its cars safer, and ultimately to pursue development of fully autonomous vehicles.\u201cG.M. is a much more entrepreneurial company now than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said David E. Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cThat has happened since the bankruptcy \u2014 the fact they are no longer wedded to doing things the way they did in the past.\u201dIn the summer of 2015, Ms. Barra and other senior G.M. executives began a series of visits to California, to study advances in self-driving cars and to scout potential partners in developing autonomous models.In addition to observing how companies like Google were developing driverless technology, the executives became acquainted with work being done by Cruise Automation, a tiny start-up working out of a San Francisco warehouse.By February of last year, officials decided that if G.M. was serious about the race to build the car of the future, it had to move quickly \u2014 or risk falling further behind.\u201cWe had to be very honest with ourselves,\u201d Mr. Ammann recalled recently. \u201cThere were some capabilities we did not have and that we needed to have if we really wanted to pursue this.\u201dAnd it was up to Mr. Ammann \u2014 an industry outsider born in New Zealand who worked as a Wall Street investment banker before joining G.M. \u2014 to deliver the crucial piece.He concluded that the perfect match was Cruise, which had fewer than 40 employees but was moving quickly to retrofit basic cars with its self-driving equipment.\u201cWhat they brought us was exactly what we were missing,\u201d Mr. Ammann said.Kyle Vogt, Cruise\u2019s co-founder and software guru, said that he had been intrigued by G.M.\u2019s interest, but hesitant to rush into a partnership with a huge, century-old automaker from Detroit.But after several one-on-one meetings with Mr. Ammann, he became convinced that G.M.\u2019s manufacturing expertise could greatly advance Cruise\u2019s mission.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.\u201cDan said to me, \u2018You want to take the chaos off the roads by introducing this great technology \u2014 can you really deny that we would get there much faster working together?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Vogt said.Mr. Vogt had learned the pitfalls of trying to adapt mainstream cars with expensive cameras, sensors and electronic equipment for use on public roadways. Converting a handful of such vehicles was a challenge. Producing fleets of them seemed beyond Cruise\u2019s abilities.\u201cYou don\u2019t see any start-ups building iPhones,\u201d he said.While Cruise began expanding its San Francisco operation to what is now nearly 400 employees, G.M. set up a team of hundreds of engineers at its technical center in Warren, Mich., to support the self-driving program.A G.M. vice president, Doug Parks, was assigned to work daily with Mr. Vogt and his California team. Together, they designed self-driving Bolts to the safety and quality standards that G.M. applied to its regular cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles.\u201cWe are working fast and furiously,\u201d said Mr. Parks, an engineer who has worked for G.M. for 33 years. \u201cIt is super exciting, and I love what the company is becoming.\u201dMr. Vogt is keen to prove that self-driving models can navigate complex urban environments such as downtown San Francisco, rather than just highways and suburban streets.On Tuesday, journalists from news organizations including The New York Times were given rides in the demonstration models.For 20 minutes, the self-driving Bolts traversed the hilly, narrow and congested streets of the city\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood \u2014 stopping for pedestrians, slowing to pass double-parked vehicles, navigating gently away from bicycles.A Cruise employee was behind the steering wheel, ready to assume control of the car if it misjudged traffic or was headed for a collision. But during a reporter\u2019s ride, no driver intervention was required.The car traveled more slowly than driver-operated vehicles on the road, and seemed to exercise extreme caution rounding corners or avoiding obstacles. Yet it covered more than two miles without a hitch, despite encountering what its onboard computer said were 265 people, 49 bicycles and 489 cars.Mr. Ammann beamed when details of the test ride were shared, declaring, \u201cThis technology is coming along faster than anyone thinks.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why German Markets Aren\u2019t Worried About Angela Merkel. Yet.", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Europe over the past decade has endured government bond meltdowns, bank failures, right-wing populists and Brexit.So when talks to form a new German government broke down last week, raising questions about Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s political future, the Continent\u2019s business elite refused to panic.\u201cThe world has so many crises. Germany is not in crisis mode at the moment,\u201d said Roland Berger, founder of the management consultancy based in Munich that bears his name.At least for now, the thriving European economy seems capable of absorbing anything that squabbling politicians might throw at it. The political deadlock in Berlin, though alarming by German standards, has not been enough to shake investors\u2019 faith that the Germans will work it out somehow.Yet there is also an uneasy feeling that the calm could be deceptive. While Germany does not have any serious economic problems that require wrenching policy changes, it faces rising longer-term challenges like an aging work force, the emergence of China as an industrial competitor and the need to invest in digital networks and a better power grid to stay relevant.And Germany\u2019s voice in important European matters that lie ahead could be diminished if Ms. Merkel oversees a weak, divided governing coalition.\u201cThere are no pressing issues for the German government to address,\u201d said Christian Kopf, head of fixed income at Union Investment, a fund manager in Frankfurt. \u201cBut we do need a capable government to deal with the severe challenges we face at the European level in the next two years.\u201dMs. Merkel, Germany\u2019s leader for more than a decade, emerged as a major global figure in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. At home, she oversaw a plunge in joblessness and an economic expansion that contrasted with misery in much of the rest of Europe.Her tenure is far from over. This week Germany\u2019s Social Democrats were reconsidering their decision not to continue a coalition government with Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats. Five years of compromising with Ms. Merkel has hurt the Social Democrats among their blue-collar base. But the alliance of the two mainstream parties provided the kind of stability that business craves.But during her 12 years in office, Ms. Merkel has largely been coasting on reforms to the labor market and social welfare system undertaken by her Social Democratic predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, at great cost to his political career.To defend its long-term competitiveness, analysts say, Germany needs to be investing in infrastructure and its work force. With an unemployment rate of only 3.6 percent, the country will face labor shortages unless it can integrate immigrants into the work force. That will require more investment in education and training.The twin pillars of German industry, precision machinery and automobiles, face unprecedented levels of technological change and new competition from places like China and Silicon Valley. European governments need to respond by, for example, building charging networks to encourage an electric car industry.\u201cThere is a deep structural adjustment process underway that requires assistance from the government,\u201d said Ralph Wiechers, chief economist of VDMA, an organization that represents German engineering companies. \u201cWhat are we producing in the future for what markets? What skills do we need to be competitive?\u201dMs. Merkel has cordial if sometimes tense relations with German chief executives. She has led delegations of German business leaders to Beijing and other foreign destinations to promote their exports, and she beat back proposals that would have increased taxes.\u201cShe hasn\u2019t done anything against business, on the other side she hasn\u2019t done a lot for business,\u201d Mr. Wiechers said. \u201cThere are no big programs where you can say, \u2018She did this for the economy.\u2019\u201dOn balance, Europe\u2019s management class would probably be sorry to see Ms. Merkel go. Europe\u2019s economy recovery is still young, and followed almost a decade of financial crisis and recession that nearly destroyed the eurozone. Right-wing populism has been contained in Western Europe but remains a threat.Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the chairman of the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, credited Ms. Merkel with neutralizing reactionary elements in Germany and restraining those in her party who would have gladly let the eurozone collapse rather than support it with German tax revenue.Despite the mixed feelings that business leaders have about the chancellor, her departure amid political disorder could shake their confidence. There are no potential successors with anywhere near her track record or international stature.\u201cIt depends on how long the uncertainty lasts,\u201d Mr. Bini Smaghi said. \u201cIn the European business world, the role she played in the crisis to push Germany forward rather than backward is very much appreciated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
