{"Headline": "Another Foothold for Philippine Cuisine", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City8 PhotosIn the Philippines, this is inihaw na panga, a specialty of the island of Mindanao. Mario Albenio (known as Boyet), the chef and owner of Tito Rad\u2019s, grew up there, on a farm in Tacurong in the province of Sultan Kudarat, where his mother ran a carinderia, or small roadside restaurant. Tuna jaw reminds him of \u201cgoing to the beach, playing guitars, booze,\u201d he said.\u201cI wanted to be a forester,\u201d he went on with a sigh. \u201cClose to nature.\u201d Instead, he followed his mother\u2019s lead and cooked, in Manila and then New York, where he opened Tito Rad\u2019s in 2006 with his wife, Susan Albenio (known as Toti), close to the strip of Roosevelt Avenue called Little Manila.Tito Rad\u2019s is a reminder that fine Filipino cooking has been with us all along. For here, as for the last decade, is ukoy, fritters of shrimp ensnared in deep-fried tendrils of bean sprouts and carrots, with club soda in the batter to give it a lift. And immaculate cylinders of lumpiang Shanghai, often compared to Chinese spring rolls but more slender and delicate, their crispy skins like gilded air. And tortang talong, whole eggplant buried in an omelet with only the stem peeking out and the bronzed eggs disclosing seams of pork and shrimp.Sisig, typically a hash of pig face (snout, jowls, ears), is here all pliant pork belly, reduced to juicy rubble, baked and then half-charred on a hissing skillet in a lacework of onions, whose sweetness cuts the fat. A rinse of lemon, and the meat arrives still cooking and crackling as it lands on the table, smoke rolling off the hot plate and a raw yolk (on request) trembling at the center. (I did miss ears to gnaw on.)Alongside that daunting tuna jaw might be kalderetang kambing, goat braised in tomato pur\u00e9e, with green olives leaching brine and liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 extending its dark mineral contour. More liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 is loosened with vinegar as a dipping sauce for lechon kawali, hunks of pork belly that emerge from the fryer equal parts shatter, sink and chew.Ampalaya, or bitter melon, is tossed into a pan of scrambled eggs at the last minute, so it loses none of its color or crunch. It\u2019s still defiantly bitter, but with a cooling freshness. Langka, or jackfruit, is slowly undone by coconut milk, until its texture is somewhere between short rib and potato.Best of all is laing, a tangle of taro leaves, flown in from Hawaii and carefully pruned of their stems, saturated with coconut milk and braised into a soupy, sublime mess. (Be warned: For most of the vegetable dishes here, pork and shrimp lie in the depths.)A few years ago, Tito Rad\u2019s (the name means Uncle Rad\u2019s, short for Conrado) took over the storefront next to its original location. Now there\u2019s a back room for spillover and sprawling parties, outfitted with wooden slat windows and green wall panels, which Mr. Albenio wistfully said was meant to evoke outdoor dining. Tables are covered in white paper, quickly stained by the procession of dishes. The front window is etched with the restaurant\u2019s logo, a man in a fedora, testament to Mr. Albenio\u2019s love of hats.Dessert is another crowd of plates: airy turon, lumpia with oozy guts of caramelized banana; a threesome of dense cassava cake, jammy ube halaya and leche flan, akin to cr\u00e8me caramel; and langka ice cream, made by Nenette Albenio, the chef\u2019s sister, which tastes of sheer voluptuousness and, improbably, the scent of sampaguita, Philippine jasmine.One night there were slices of birthday cake, too, insistently shared by a 75th birthday party in raucous swing. With the cake came a story, of how the woman of honor had never married, how she had instead devoted her life to bringing her relatives to the United States, all of them now assembled here. The inscription in the icing read: Auntie.Advertisement"}

This ultimately results in higher prices and lower quality service for consumers.\u201dAT&T/DirecTV executives have concluded that the \u201crunway\u201d for the decline of traditional payTV \u201cmay be longer than some think given the economics of the space,\u201d and that it is \u201cupon us to utilize our assets to extend that runway.\u201dAT&T itself has previously stated that access to some of the most popular television programming is \u201ccritical to preserve and promote competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming.\u201d\u201cAfter reviewing DOJ\u2019s lawsuit against AT&T-Time Warner and watching AT&T\u2019s press conference, we still see a settlement as possible and, failing that, we believe AT&T would prevail in court.\u201d\u201cUnder my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,\u201d F.C.C. chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that\u2019s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate.\u201dThe move is a win for the giant telecoms like AT&T and Verizon as well as the big cable providers such as Comcast.\u201cThe losers could be internet sites that will have to answer telecom firms to get their content in front of consumers. And consumers may see their bills increase for the best quality of internet service.\u201dAndrew worked the phones yesterday and hears:Media executives at the other big content and distribution providers privately tell me that they hope AT&T and Time Warner do not find a way to settle. They are confident that the companies will win in court and hope that would put pressure on the Justice Department as it examines future deals.The telecommunications giant and its peers have lobbied hard against the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to prevent broadband providers from charging higher fees to access particular websites or online services like Netflix. Now the F.C.C. under Chairman Ajit Pai is poised to roll those initiatives back.Mr. Pai plans to accompany the repeal of net neutrality with several other measures that will also benefit broadband companies, said the people with knowledge of the matter. That includes suggesting that the Federal Trade Commission, which has traditionally not brought many cases, be the enforcement agency of net neutrality violations, they said.\u201cIt\u2019s not completely irrational to say the tax code is a disaster,\u201d Mr. Rattner said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here is that the importance of reforming the tax code trumps, excuse the pun, fixing the debt.\u201dBut Pete Peterson, the Blackstone co-founder and perhaps the most outspoken billionaire on the issue of the federal deficit, is having none of it.

But her victory on Tuesday was a social breakthrough that brought seasoned advocates to tears.In a local election in Northern Virginia, Danica Roem, 33, defeated a Republican who had served in the state\u2019s House of Delegates for a quarter of a century \u2014 and, in doing so, Ms. Roem became the first transgender person to be elected to the Virginia legislature.Only one other openly transgender person has been elected to a state legislature anywhere in the United States: Stacie Laughton, a Democrat who won a seat in the New Hampshire House in 2012 but never took office because of an outcry over her failure to disclose a felony conviction. Another, Althea Garrison, elected to the Massachusetts House in 1992, came out as transgender during her term in office but lost every campaign she ran after coming out.\u201cTransgender people have really good public policy ideas that span the gamut of transportation policy to health care policy to education policy, and yes, to civil rights as well,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just be pigeonholed into the idea that we\u2019re just going to be fighting about bathrooms.\u201dMs. Roem will be just one state lawmaker out of more than 7,000 nationwide, but her victory resonated far beyond her legislative influence. Gay and lesbian Americans have made major strides in terms of both social acceptance and political representation, but transgender Americans are still struggling for both. There are seven openly gay members of Congress \u2014 six in the House and one in the Senate \u2014 but no openly transgender members.

{"Headline": "In Egypt, Furious Retaliation but Failing Strategy in Sinai", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sisi went on television vowing to \u201ctake revenge\u201d and strike back with an \u201ciron fist.\u201d Moments later, Egyptian warplanes swooped over the vast deserts of the Sinai Peninsula, dropping bombs that pulverized vehicles used in the assault. Soldiers fanned out across the area.One of the most striking aspects of the carnage that unfolded on Friday, the deadliest terrorist attack in Egypt\u2019s modern history, was how easy it was for the militants to carry it out.In a statement issued on Saturday, Egypt\u2019s prosecutor general, Nabil Sadek, described the grisly scene in forensic detail.Between 25 and 30 gunmen, traveling in five vehicles and carrying an Islamic State flag, surrounded a Sufi mosque on all sides in Bir al-Abed, a dusty town on a road that arcs across the sandy plain of North Sinai.After an explosion, they positioned themselves outside the main entrance of the mosque and its 12 windows, spraying the worshipers with gunfire. Seven parked cars were set ablaze to prevent victims from escaping. Among the dead were 27 children.For Sinai residents, the attack deepened an abiding sense of dread about life in a part of Egypt where many feel trapped between barbarous militants and a heartless military. At a hospital in nearby Ismailia, survivors recounted how they leapt through windows as militants raked them with gunfire, or of watching their friends and relatives die.\u201cIf even mosques are being targeted, then where are we safe?\u201d said Mohamed Abdel Salam, 22.For Sinai experts, the assault sharpened scrutiny of Egypt\u2019s counterinsurgency tactics against a dogged Islamist insurgency that has surged in strength since 2013, after Mr. Sisi came to power in a military takeover.They paint a picture of a stubbornly outmoded approach that is unsuited to the fight, and that perpetuates the mistakes of successive Egyptian leaders.For decades Egypt has seen Sinai through a military prism, taking an aggressive approach to an alienated local population. The military has engaged in summary executions and the destruction of whole villages, while offering little to solve the region\u2019s deep social and economic problems, including chronic unemployment, illiteracy and poor access to health care.Egyptian soldiers and conscripts are hunkered down inside heavily protected bases, venturing out in armored convoys that barrel down long, exposed roads.Those roads are filled with check posts manned by nervous soldiers, many of them conscripts. The insurgents, some with roots in Sinai\u2019s long tradition of smuggling, skirt through the desert.\u201cThe Egyptians have failed to acknowledge that ISIS is not just a terrorism threat,\u201d said Andrew Miller, a former Egypt specialist at the National Security Council, now at the Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington. \u201cKilling terrorists is not sufficient. They need to deprive ISIS of local support, which is rooted in Cairo\u2019s historical neglect of the Sinai.\u201dBut that support has been eroded by multiple accounts of torture and extrajudicial executions by the military, as well as indiscriminate military tactics that often inflict civilian casualties and sow widespread resentment.\u201cThe military has never cared for civilian losses,\u201d said Mohannad Sabry, author of a book on Sinai. \u201cThe excessive and reckless use of force has killed entire families. We\u2019ve seen airstrikes blow people up in their homes. We\u2019ve seen villages razed off the face of the earth. That tells you something about how they see Sinai society.\u201dOver the past year, Mr. Sisi has welcomed a line of foreign leaders to Cairo, where he signed deals for billions of dollars in advanced military equipment: German submarines, Russian combat helicopters, a French aircraft carrier and a military satellite. American military officials have tried quietly to persuade him to allocate his resources, including $1.3 billion in annual American aid, to tools and techniques better suited to fighting the insurgency in Sinai, like equipment and training for intelligence gathering.But Mr. Sisi, they say, is not listening, and his generals prefer to buy tanks, jets and other heavy weapons for their bases around the Nile.\u201cThey understand they have got a problem in Sinai, but they have been unprepared to invest in the capabilities to deal with it,\u201d said Steven Simon, a professor at Amherst College and a former senior director for the Middle East and North Africa on the National Security Council.One person who did have some sway over Mr. Sisi was Egypt\u2019s chief of defense staff, Mahmoud Hegazy. American officials saw him as the only person in Mr. Sisi\u2019s inner circle with the authority to publicly contradict him, a former United States official said. They also had a personal bond: General Hegazy\u2019s daughter is married to Mr. Sisi\u2019s son.The move dismayed senior State and Defense Department officials who saw General Hegazy as a check on Mr. Sisi in a circle of advisers that has become ever smaller and, some fear, ever more sycophantic, said the former official, who spoke anonymously to protect internal deliberations on an important ally that rarely receives public criticism well.Sinai presents a formidable arena for counterinsurgency that would challenge the most capable army: It is a vast terrain of desert and mountains, with long shorelines and a semiporous back door across the border into Gaza, which has been controlled by Hamas.The collapse of Libya in 2011 has ensured a steady flow of weapons ever since, some from the depots of the deposed Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi. In the past year, as the Islamic State\u2019s vision of a caliphate in Syria and Iraq has crumbled, experts have fretted about an influx of returning Egyptian jihadis, bent on bringing their fight back home.So far, American officials say, a relatively small number of fighters have returned. But the collapse of Raqqa and Mosul has precipitated a sharp shift in the Islamic State\u2019s tactics in Sinai, with a greater emphasis on attacks against soft targets, like Coptic Christians and Sufis, in a bid to undermine Mr. Sisi by sowing sectarian hatred in Egyptian society.Little of Egypt\u2019s fight against the Islamic State in Sinai is visible to the outside world, or even most Egyptians. Foreign reporters and most Egyptian ones are not allowed into Sinai. Concrete information about the conflict is hard to come by: On its Facebook page, the Egyptian military claims to have killed at least 3,000 Islamist militants, far more than the hundreds it once estimated were there.A leaked videotape last April depicted those claims in a very different light. It showed a military unit, made up of Sinai locals and accompanied by senior army officers, executing detainees \u2014 local men in jeans \u2014 on a desolate patch of ground in Sinai. Earlier, on its Facebook page, the army had claimed the men died in a shootout.Amnesty International, which confirmed the video\u2019s authenticity, said it was consistent with a pattern of military-led abuses it has documented in Sinai.In private, Mr. Sisi\u2019s officials argue that they don\u2019t need to take lessons from the Americans. They point to what they say is a failure of American counterinsurgency ventures in Iraq and Afghanistan. And they add that their methods worked in the 1990s and 2000s, at least temporarily and in other parts of Egypt, when President Hosni Mubarak authorized harsh measures to disarm militants who attacked Western tourists at historical sites.\u201cThey look back and say: This is how we did it, and it worked,\u201d said Zack Gold, a Sinai expert at the Hariri Center at the Atlantic Council. But, Mr. Gold added, the conditions are radically different in North Sinai, where residents have suffered years of neglect and mistreatment from the Egyptian mainland.Sinai residents complain of feeling isolated, even culturally distant, from the Nile Valley where the vast majority of Egyptians live. Many in the North Sinai refer to other Egyptians as \u201cpeople of the valley,\u201d as though they were citizens of another country. Some speak nostalgically of more effective governance when the peninsula was under Israeli control, between the Israeli seizure of the area in the Six Day war in 1967 and its return to Egypt in 1982.The Bedouin tribes who live there, often portrayed as outlaws in Egyptian popular culture, say they feel greater kinship with the tribes in Gaza \u2014 a connection that has bred longstanding suspicion among officials in Cairo, especially since the Israeli occupation.South Sinai, around Sharm el Sheikh, and Mount Sinai developed into a tourist destination. But the North remained loosely governed and some of the tribes who lived there considered smuggling a birthright, and resented Cairo\u2019s attempts to restrict it.\u201cMany Egyptians west of the Suez don\u2019t consider the Bedouin to be fully Egyptian,\u201d Mr. Miller, the analyst, said. \u201cThey have poorer educational and employment opportunities, and they are largely shut out of government jobs and the security services.\u201dCynicism about the central government was evident outside the Ismailia hospital on Friday, where an elderly Bedouin woman in black sat on the muddy lawn, huddled under a blanket for warmth. She refused to give her name, citing fear of reprisals from either the military and Islamic State. \u201cIf either side sees our names, they will kill us. They are as bad as each other,\u201d she said.\u201cThe military will keep jailing and killing local young people. The terrorists who hate us and the Christians will keep using it as an excuse to kill us,\u201d she added. \u201cThere is no point in talking about anything.\u201dFollow Declan Walsh on Twitter @declanwalsh and David Kirkpatrick @ddknytDeclan Walsh reported from Cairo, and David Kirkpatrick from London.

{"Headline": "Snapchat\u2019s New Test: Grow Like Facebook, Without the Baggage", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIn today\u2019s social media industry, you essentially have two options: Die young, or live long enough to turn into Facebook.Snap has also revamped its ad-buying process to be more like Facebook\u2019s, with ads that can be purchased through an automated system. And it signaled last week that it wanted to expand its presence in the developing world, where Facebook is dominant. Only about 25 percent of Snapchat\u2019s daily active users live outside North America and Europe, compared with more than 65 percent of Facebook\u2019s users.Instagram Stories, a near-clone of Snapchat\u2019s most distinctive feature, has reached 300 million daily active users, nearly twice as many as Snapchat. Facebook\u2019s enormous profits have given lofty expectations to investors in other social media companies, and its more than two billion users have made everything else seem small by comparison.But Snap\u2019s pivot is more than a necessary business move. It\u2019s an indictment of our current tech landscape, and a warning sign for other start-ups hoping to take on the largest internet companies on their own terms. If a wildly creative company with an app used by 178 million people every day can still be crushed by Facebook, how is anyone supposed to succeed?Still, the fact that Snap\u2019s future is uncertain should worry you, even if you\u2019ve never used its products. A world in which every successful internet platform is expected to behave like Facebook is a more boring, less innovative world, with no companies to challenge Facebook\u2019s vision of the future. It\u2019s not a good sign that in order to survive as a competitor, Snap may have to abandon the qualities that made it different in the first place.Snapchat\u2019s distinctive qualities also helped steer it clear of some problems that are now plaguing its rivals.\u201cA social network acts against users\u2019 interests when it needs to make money,\u201d he said.Snapchat, Mr. Gallagher writes, was never supposed to be just a photo-sharing app. It was the embodiment of Mr. Spiegel\u2019s worldview about how the internet should work \u2014 temporary instead of permanent, private instead of public, candid instead of rehearsed. I asked Mr. Gallagher why Snap needed to compromise its values in pursuit of Facebook-style growth. Couldn\u2019t it reject Wall Street\u2019s demands, concentrate on making its existing users happy and be satisfied as a smaller and more focused company?\u201cHe has grand, sweeping visions of the future,\u201d Mr. Gallagher said. \u201cIt would be very hard for him to eat a slice of humble pie and say: \u2018We\u2019re not going to be Facebook. We\u2019re going to be a 150-million-user social network that plays in a well carved-out niche.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.\u201dThe world\u2019s largest banks have become better capitalized since financial crisis. They have raised more than $1.5 trillion in capital, according to the Financial Stability Board. That provides the banks with \u201cbuffers as much as 10x higher than a decade,\u201d writes S&P Global.But these financial instutions have also gotten much larger since the financial crisis.In the United States, for example, JPMorgan Chase has nearly doubled in size since the end of 2006. Bank of America has increased its asset by more than 50 percent, and Wells Fargo\u2019s assets are up more than 300 percent from their pre-crisis levels, according to S&P Global.Much of those increases are a result of deals struck during the heights of the crisis. JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual; Bank of America acquired CountryWide and Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo purchased Wachovia.Still the size of these banks is noteworthy. The \u2018too big to fail\u2019 distinction has drawn scrutiny from the Trump administration this year.

Less than 40% is, well, remarkable,\u201d writes DataTrek\u2019s co-founder Nicholas Colas.\u2022 Slightly more than 27 percent expect bitcoin to rise but at much slower pace. Just 16% think the value of bitcoin will double in the next six months.\u2022 \u201cA sizeable minority of respondents (39 \u2013 40 percent) see bitcoin as a potential analog to physical gold, both as a safe haven and a hedge against mistakes in central bank monetary policy,\u201d Mr. Colas writrs.

Prosecutions were rare, except with obscure, or relatively junior, industry players against whom it was easy to build cases, because prosecutors were under pressure to move quickly and win cases.Philip Baker became one of those targets.He was not a big fish.

{"Headline": "Disrupting the World of Private School With Tech and Guinea Pigs", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLong dominated by a small group of elite institutions, New York City\u2019s private schools have limited seats, annual tuition approaching $50,000, and an admissions process that can drive even the most levelheaded parents to teeth-grinding anxiety. The schools range in philosophy from traditional to progressive, but in general, they change slowly, if at all.Now, a rash of start-ups say they can offer more 21st-century alternatives \u2014 and make a profit in the process.WeWork envisions its educational and real estate businesses as mutually reinforcing, offering parents the chance to drop their children off at school in the same building where they work, and where they could possibly meet them for lunch. In the long run, the company foresees replicating the school in many of the 52 cities where WeWork operates, so that parents who need to travel or move for work purposes could transfer their children from one WeGrow outpost to another, as easily as plugging in a MacBook Air at a new location.Unlike most of New York\u2019s private schools, these newcomers are all for-profit businesses.Matt Greenfield, a managing partner of ReThink Education, a venture capital firm focused on education technology, said that this group of new schools seemed to reflect a mix of passion projects, started by parents frustrated with the available options who want to create their dream school, and cold-eyed business ventures.\u201cSchools are not an inherently bad business,\u201d he said. \u201cNew York has a scarily high real estate cost, and other costs are high, too,\u201d but the tuition a school can charge in New York is high, as well, he said. \u201cSo I think those are not implausible businesses.\u201dAvenues has succeeded in attracting students \u2014 1,600 children are enrolled in preschool through 12th grade at its campus in Chelsea \u2014 but its international expansion has not gone as planned. So far, the New York school is the only one operating.Some observers are skeptical of the new crop of schools. Amanda Uhry, the founder and owner of Manhattan Private School Advisors, which helps families with the admissions process, said she discourages parents from applying to for-profit schools, because she doesn\u2019t have confidence in the long-term stability of those schools.\u201cThere are people who these schools obviously attract and obviously go there,\u201d she said, but only because they don\u2019t get into the more prestigious nonprofit schools. In her experience, she added, many families \u201cwould rather go to public school than go to a privately owned new school that has no history.\u201dStill, WeWork seems confident it will find a market. An adviser to its school effort \u2014 whom the company provided to speak only on the condition of anonymity because the details of his employment have yet to be worked out \u2014 said that the pedagogy would draw from progressive models, like Waldorf and Montessori. Students will practice yoga and meditation. They will regularly visit the Neumanns\u2019 60-acre farm in Pound Ridge, N.Y., and cook with ingredients procured there.Ms. Neumann told Bloomberg that students would be mentored by the entrepreneurs who rent space from WeWork and encouraged to start their own businesses. Ms. Neumann said that an 8-year-old in a small pilot school that WeWork has been running this year made T-shirts to sell at a farm stand the children run and would soon train as an apprentice with fashion designers who work in WeWork offices.The school will likely start inside the WeWork space on West 18th Street and later move to its future headquarters in the Lord & Taylor building on Fifth Avenue. The design, by the Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, will seek to \u201cundo the compartmentalization often found in traditional school environments,\u201d according to Mr. Ingels\u2019s firm.WeWork is aiming to begin next year with about 70 students from age 3 to fourth grade, and eventually expand to 12th grade.Mr. Greenfield, of ReThink Education, said that, from what he has read, Ms. Neumann seemed sincere, and that he thought exposing students to business and other possible careers was beneficial.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that it will work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I doubt many children will be drastically harmed in any way if it doesn\u2019t.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T\u2019s C.E.O. Meets Trump\u2019s Justice", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI have no evidence that there\u2019s been inappropriate behavior. What I have is a really peculiar timeline.\u201dI\u2019m on the line with Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive. I\u2019ve heard other C.E.O.s offer up brutal judgments of this and previous administrations \u2014 invariably in off-the-record interviews. This one\u2019s on the record.Stephenson is battling the Justice Department, which this week sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner. The suit marks the first time in nearly 40 years that Justice has tried to quash such a deal, known as a vertical merger. The Obama administration approved a similar merger \u2014 one that brings together companies that don\u2019t compete and that offer different products and services \u2014 between Comcast and NBC Universal in 2011.That was before he got his current job. Once he did, Stephenson says, \u201cTemperatures change rather quickly, and Delrahim\u2019s own attitude changes rather quickly.\u201dIn other words, either Delrahim has miraculously seen the liberal light when it comes to vertical mergers, or he\u2019s channeling the wishes, implied or explicit, of the \u201cvery frustrated\u201d man who has made his feelings about the merger well known and could yet make him Sessions\u2019s successor.The government claims that the merged company could jack up prices on other distributors for must-watch content like H.B.O.\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d and that it would also \u201cslow the industry\u2019s transition to new and exciting video distribution models.\u201d But the arguments, Stephenson notes, are \u201cbizarre at best.\u201d\u201cOne has to assume two things,\u201d he says of the idea that the merger will lead to higher prices for consumers. \u201cThat [Time Warner subsidiary] Turner has market power, and that [AT&T subsidiary] DirecTV has market power.\u201d But with roughly 10 percent and 20 percent of their respective markets, they don\u2019t. As for the industry\u2019s \u201ctransition,\u201d has the government not heard of Amazon Prime?In the meantime, companies like Google and Facebook are gobbling up digital advertising dollars. \u201cHow do we compete with these guys?\u201d Stephenson wonders. \u201cIf we can\u2019t take someone with less than 10 percent of viewership and pair it with distribution, what can we do?\u201dThat\u2019s the economic question. Then there\u2019s the political one. Donald Trump makes no secret of his feelings about CNN, a Turner subsidiary. On Tuesday he reiterated his view that the merger was \u201cnot a good deal for the country.\u201dBut the circumstantial case that the Justice Department\u2019s decision is politically motivated is compelling. For conservatives, it\u2019s a fresh reminder that the administration\u2019s pro-business convictions go only as far as the president\u2019s convenience. A Sanders presidency would also have opposed the merger, though at least it would have done so honestly. What we have instead is economic policy conducted as an extension of presidential pique.As for liberals, those inclined to agree with Justice\u2019s decision should note how similar it is to the administration\u2019s curious outreach to Russia. The curiosity isn\u2019t that there is no rational argument for improving relations with Moscow or opposing the merger. It\u2019s that the argument is being made by an administration whose ideological instincts otherwise lean in the opposite direction.I ask Stephenson if the government\u2019s suit smacks of the kind of political risk multinational companies often face in autocratic countries such as Russia or Turkey, where the whims of the ruler have a way of translating into the judgment of regulators and courts.\u201cI don\u2019t know if there has been political interference, but it\u2019s logical to ask questions,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be na\u00efve not to.\u201dGail Collins is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shocking: Trump Makes the Right Choice With Jerome Powell", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPerhaps not surprisingly, President Trump seemed to treat the appointment of a new head of the Federal Reserve \u2014 arguably the most important personnel decision he has faced \u2014 a bit like a season of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d dangling tantalizing hints before handing the rose to Jerome H. Powell.In doing so, Mr. Trump, more surprisingly, picked by far the better suited of his two semipublic finalists.That\u2019s because Mr. Powell, a current member of the Federal Reserve Board, resides firmly in the camp of supporters of the Fed\u2019s policy of maintaining its low interest policy as long as inflation stays muted and wage increases remain stubbornly small.The other candidate \u2014 the economist John B. Taylor, the reported choice of Vice President Mike Pence and other hard-line conservatives \u2014 is openly hawkish, having warned for years that the central bank\u2019s easy money policy was stoking future inflation.Most prominently, in November 2010, Mr. Taylor was among 24 signatories to an open letter to Ben Bernanke, then the chairman, attacking a signature aspect of the Fed\u2019s efforts to stimulate a sluggish economy, its \u201cquantitative easing\u201d program of purchasing debt in the market to keep interest rates low.These purchases \u201crisk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed\u2019s objective of promoting employment,\u201d the group wrote.That was wrong in 2010 and is still wrong today. In the intervening seven years, 16 million jobs have been created. Meanwhile, inflation, which was running just over 1 percent when the letter was written, has barely budged.In a recent study, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis came to a similar conclusion: Had the central bank followed Mr. Taylor\u2019s prescription, the higher interest rates that he advocates would have resulted in 2.5 million more Americans being out of work today \u2014 enough, the Minneapolis bank observed, to fill all 31 National Football League stadiums at the same time.However, neither is Mr. Powell excessively dovish; he has not dissented from any Fed decision since becoming a governor in May 2012, including the four recent interest rate increases.Perhaps the biggest question mark swirling around Mr. Powell is that he is not a trained economist. The short reign of the last Federal Reserve chair to lack a deep background in economics, G. William Miller, was disastrous: In 1979, he was outvoted by his own board when he opposed an interest-rate increase that was, in retrospect, badly needed to combat raging inflation.But Mr. Miller had scant previous experience in Washington or in finance; Mr. Powell, a lawyer and, later, a partner at the investment firm Carlyle Group, has substantial amounts of both, including at the Treasury Department.That distinguishes him from many other Trump picks with their more modest qualifications for their posts.Mr. Powell is also distinctive for having distanced himself just a few months ago from Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to deregulate the financial sector, calling it a \u201cmixed bag\u201d and noting that \u201cthere are some ideas that I would not support.\u201dWhile advocating some regulatory relief, particularly for smaller banks, he has voted in favor of every proposal to tighten bank regulations during his tenure on the Fed.Interestingly, like the president\u2019s own deregulatory proposals, all of Mr. Trump\u2019s five semifinalists were not only well qualified but were also far removed from the anti-bank fervor of the populist wing of the Republican Party.In some ways, the choice of Mr. Powell shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. As a highly leveraged real estate developer, Mr. Trump benefited enormously from low interest rates.While the president\u2019s musings on monetary policy have been characteristically inconsistent and even incoherent, he\u2019s mostly sounded like this: \u201cI do like a low interest rate policy, I must be honest with you,\u201d he said in April.For his part, Mr. Powell has happily made clear his lack of affection for Mr. Taylor\u2019s signature contribution to the monetary policy debate, a mathematical rule for setting interest rates that, if applied, would cause rates to be about two percentage points higher today than they are.\u201cI am unable to think of any critical, complex human activity that could be safely reduced to a simple summary equation,\u201d he said at a New York luncheon in February.Even if economic conditions remain quiescent, the Fed will still face challenges, including how quickly to raise interest rates and, as important, how rapidly to reduce its vast holdings of debt securities.For those and other reasons, I would have preferred that Mr. Trump reappoint the current chairman, Janet Yellen.But at least, for once, Mr. Trump has rejected both traditional Republican conservatives as well as his populist base and made a sensible choice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mourning in Paris", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal JourneysParis understands that you aren\u2019t in the mood to laugh. The museums will provide you with innumerable paintings of a headless John the Baptist, one from every angle as if they are crime scene photos, and paintings of Jesus killed in many more ways than are in our historical record \u2014 more ways than actually exist to kill a man in general \u2014 and still other paintings depicting war and combat and babies being eaten. Babies! Being eaten! The sheer scale of the paintings conveys their seriousness; their intensity is their importance. The amount of space they\u2019re allowed to take up is what you need to know about Paris\u2019 priorities. Paris understands that the only cure for your sadness is blood.In every corner of Paris I was reminded: the city is old; it stays the same. People will try to tell you how different it is, how it has evolved: The food scene is different; the construction is killing that neighborhood; the tourists are getting more obnoxious. But, for me, those changes barely register. Paris is essentially the same. That\u2019s the whole point of it.Paris reassures you that you are in a cycle of life that will end, and that everyone before you has felt just as important and just as crucial to the cycle, and yet, they ended, too. Paris is a good place to remind yourself that everything ends. In America, we think we\u2019ll find a cure for all of this. But Paris assures you that you are mortal, here for a blink of time, that the world will barely register your existence before you are gone. This is the existential dread of Paris, and this is also the way that Paris sets you free.Richard was American but he moved to Europe right after he graduated from Oberlin in the 1960s. I\u2019d been to Paris three or four times in my life, each time to visit Richard, and to see the city. My sister and I came to spend a month with him in the summer following my first year of college. Richard was Paris for me, and Paris was Richard.He\u2019d been sick for a long time, but the last time we spoke, he told me that he was on a new kind of therapy for his cancer. He said it would allow him to live 10 more years. I told him about my work and my new house and my move across the country; I told him I would try to get a story to take me to Paris. I began pitching a story about French anti-Semitism to travel magazines. I asked them to let me visit Paris one last time before they stopped allowing Jews in. No one bit. I never made it. I learned from a text message that he died. My sister had seen notes of condolence on his Facebook page. I pulled over in the parking lot of a ShopRite and put my head on my steering wheel and cried.We were both journalists, Richard and me. He made documentaries about Russia for Channel 13 in New York, and then for Al Jazeera. He was the only other person in my family with a rebellious streak. We had so many similarities, and yet, he wasn\u2019t a blood relation. \u201cYou look alike,\u201d a Frenchwoman he was dating once told us. \u201cYou have the same\u201d \u2014 she searched for the English word \u2014 \u201cbigness to your face.\u201dMy most enduring memories of Richard were from my and my sister\u2019s stay when I was 18. We drove around in his BMW convertible with the top down while he played Billy Idol; we ate a sandwich outside the Pompidou Center, where he told me family secrets; he gave me his copy of \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d because he didn\u2019t ever speak down to me or fetishize my youth or try to protect me; he took us to Euro Disney, right when it first opened, him insisting that we go despite our ages, all the time looking around in disgust and saying, \u201cLook at all this canned happiness!\u201d He leaned against a bar at a brasserie, downing an espresso in one shot \u2014 I don\u2019t think I ever realized what it meant to be cool until I saw him do that. For years after, I tried to develop a taste for espresso shots, and for drinking them in his casual, leaning way. I couldn\u2019t pull it off.During my trip to Paris this summer, his affiliation with the city haunted every stop. I thought I saw him outside the Louvre. I thought I saw him in line for a movie. I thought I saw him outside the Zara shop. A man at the Orsay, a man at Buvette, a man at the Louvre, a man on the Metro. I thought I saw him in the lobby of my hotel \u2014 for a second they all looked like him, and in my protracted mourning, as my brain tried to calibrate for a Paris without Richard, I was sure he was everywhere. But he was nowhere, not anymore. Richard was everywhere, except that he was nowhere.It is embarrassing to like Impressionists. Maybe it\u2019s fine if you\u2019re an art person, but let\u2019s say you are just a museum tourist like I am \u2014 they convey a lack of sophistication. I knew this from when I was very young, when my school friends were framing Monet prints in their childhood bedrooms \u2014 I was subversive so I chose Warhols. I went to all the museums while I waited to go see my family, but each time I got drawn to the Impressionists. No, it turns out I didn\u2019t want the blood bath that Paris was offering me at the Louvre. I wanted these paintings that were pretty, and I couldn\u2019t for the life of me figure out why.Richard was a gifted archivist of his life. On every page was a picture of him in a new setting, sometimes with other people, but never anyone consistently until he met his wife. He had a way of looking at the camera like he could see beyond the lens and into the eyes of the person staring. I went through page after page, and sometimes I saw him with my father or aunt or grandmother, or with me and my sisters. My aunt pointed out his old girlfriends, and his friends she was still in touch with, and the pictures from when their son was born.I came to a photo of Cinderella\u2019s castle at what was then called Euro Disney, with me and my sister and Richard in Mickey Mouse ears in front of it. We were laughing. \u201cAll this canned happiness,\u201d he had said that day. But we were happy there. I know it for sure. We had played Billy Idol all the way there and my sister and I kept singing the same lyric over from \u201cFlesh for Fantasy.\u201d We were happy being better than Disney and the people who visited it. I saw that picture and I put my face in my hands and I cried. His wife stood up, placed her hands on my shoulders and put her head against mine so that we were both looking at the photo. She told me that they\u2019d taken their son to Disney, too, and that he\u2019d said the same things that day to them.Their son came home. He is 8 now, beautiful and charming and smart. I wish I could tell Richard how I loved him immediately. My aunt told me he was the light of Richard\u2019s life, how he had resisted becoming a father, but from the moment he was born, it was all he cared about. He has his mother\u2019s coloring, but he looks just like Richard \u2014 and not at all like me.They wanted to bring me to visit his grave. I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to go. If I saw where Richard ended up, then I would know that he was truly gone. I didn\u2019t want to stop seeing his face everywhere yet. Seeing him everywhere had been a gift, but it had also proven to me just how little I knew about him. Seeing him everywhere made me wonder what he thought of certain things. I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019d been too young.I should have found a way to come sooner. I thought I\u2019d had more time. I thought that adulthood would make me into someone who knew things about my family, but you have to do hard work to know people. You have to look at someone until you truly know him. That\u2019s the thing about the Impressionists. They stared and stared at a singular scene or object until they knew it well enough to interpret it. They stared until they understood it. How do you learn to do that when someone lives so far away? How do you learn to convey your love when it all took place in passing? You have to find the time to stare at things; the time was never handed to us. It\u2019s never handed to us ever anymore. You have to assume that you will never see him again.Yes, to see him again. How I wanted to just see him one more time. How I realized now that I had never looked at him closely \u2014 not closely enough, anyway, not enough to know him and to memorize him and to not need these pictures to remember him. Maybe that was what was appealing about the Impressionists. Those artists, they knew what was up. They knew that the feat of art was to stand there and look at something \u2014 something as innocent and workaday as just another person \u2014 and see it so hard that you understood it. That you could interpret it. That you could know it so well that even as you made it fuzzier, it still recalled the detail of the original thing. Yes, that\u2019s what the Impressionists were. They were people who spent time staring, though the world tapped them on the shoulder with all of the distractions of life. If I could look at Richard again, I would memorize him. If I could see him one more time, I would look at him the way he looked at the camera and I would know him forever.When Richard and I last spoke, he was not stoic about death. He didn\u2019t pretend this was all O.K. with him. And now he was gone, and I loved him, but I didn\u2019t know anything about him, not really as an adult, at least. Left without a real understanding of him, all I had was his face, and now that would be gone, too.I hugged my aunt and my cousin goodbye and I took an Uber to the Mus\u00e9e Rodin. I thought about statues, then, how they each represented years of people\u2019s lives: The people who stood and painstakingly made them, the people who, absent Polaroids, posed for them. I thought about art, how the miracle of it is that it forces you to look at something hard, and that art itself is the result of someone looking at something very hard for a very long time and trying to make sense of it. I didn\u2019t see Richard\u2019s face again in anyone else\u2019s face after I visited his grave. Instead I saw everything that was old and that was Paris and that would have been the same whether or not my uncle had ever lived there. I thought of Richard, in the ground, now a part of Paris forever, as if he hadn\u2019t been already.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an Impressionist artist.

{"Headline": "How ABC Found a Surprise Hit in \u2018The Good Doctor\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDaniel Dae Kim was wide awake and scrolling through Twitter at 4 a.m. when he realized \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d was going to be a hit.It was a Tuesday in September, and Mr. Kim, a 49-year-old actor known for his work on \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d and \u201cLost,\u201d found himself in bed in western Bulgaria not far from the set of \u201cHellboy,\u201d a movie he was filming for release next year.He had a special interest in \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d because it represented his first outing in a new role: executive producer. And so, although he had to go to work in just a few hours, he could not keep himself from checking the effusive social-media reaction to the show\u2019s premiere episode on ABC.When Mr. Kim stumbled onto the \u201cHellboy\u201d set in the morning, he felt just fine. \u201cI\u2019ve lived with this project since 2013, so one night of lost sleep wasn\u2019t going to make a difference,\u201d he said, laughing.The tweets Mr. Kim scrolled through that night would soon give way to hard data: ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d is the most watched drama on network television. With roughly 17 million viewers for each episode, according to the Nielsen ratings, it draws a bigger audience than the CBS crime show \u201cNCIS\u201d and NBC\u2019s weepy \u201cThis is Us.\u201dThe surprise hit has been a boon to ABC, which has been stuck in last place among the big four networks. It also came as sweet relief to Mr. Kim, who had spent three years developing this adaptation of a South Korean show through his 3AD production company.The show can be soapy and even a little gory. Because the protagonist speaks haltingly at times, onscreen graphics show how his beautiful mind goes at the job of deconstructing a troubled liver or heart.\u201cThis could have been terrible in the wrong hands, or lesser hands,\u201d said David Shore, an executive producer on the series, of Mr. Highmore. \u201cHe brings a humanity to this character that isn\u2019t necessarily on the page.\u201dOn Dec. 4, the show will wrap the first half of its improbably successful debut season. For every medical-genre hit like the NBC juggernaut \u201cER\u201d or the ABC stalwart \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d there are scores that never make it past season one (Remember \u201cHeartbeat,\u201d \u201cTrauma\u201d or \u201cMercy?\u201d No one else does, either.)Mr. Kim took notice of the original version of \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d an award-winning 20-episode series in South Korea, not long after it started airing in 2013. He scooped up the rights for his new production company and got to work adapting it. Because he was a star of the CBS show \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d at the time, he developed it for his home network, which ordered up a script. After taking a look, however, CBS decided against commissioning a pilot.That is usually the stage when all parties agree to leave a project behind, but Mr. Kim, who was born in South Korea and grew up in Bethlehem, Pa., bought back the rights from CBS. He felt that strongly about it.He eventually teamed up with Sony\u2019s television arm, which brought in Mr. Shore, the creator of the successful Fox medical drama \u201cHouse.\u201d Mr. Shore\u2019s version began to attract network interest \u2014 although not from CBS.\u201cCBS actually passed on it twice,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cThat was really unfortunate to me, because they were my home studio. I really wanted to bring something home to them.\u201d\u201cThe path to equality is never easy,\u201d Mr. Kim wrote in a Facebook post at the time.In the end, CBS lost a prime time actor and ABC gained an executive producer who brought it an unexpected hit.Enter, \u201cThe Good Doctor.\u201dThe show is partly the result of a programming strategy that ABC hit upon last year, after heartland voters had a strong hand in the election of President Trump \u2014 a strategy focused on \u201cnot just appealing to both coasts,\u201d said Ben Sherwood, the president of the Disney and ABC television group.Indeed, ABC executives and producers for the show are convinced that Dr. Shaun Murphy, the main character of \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d plays to a wide audience because he is innocent and never meanspirited. While the median age of the show\u2019s viewers is 58, according to Nielsen, it is also popular among teenage girls.\u201cHe\u2019s a hero we haven\u2019t really seen lately,\u201d Mr. Shore said of Dr. Murphy. \u201cHe\u2019s overcoming things he was born with. He\u2019s not a drinker. He\u2019s not a womanizer. He\u2019s not an antihero.\u201dMr. Kim said it was perhaps a \u201cblessing in disguise\u201d that \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d did not get picked up in, say, 2014, when it may have fallen flat. \u201cThere a lot of shows that have a deeply cynical take on the world,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cThis is not one of them. Given what I was reading every day in newspapers or seeing on my TV, I felt it was very much needed counterprogramming to reality.\u201dMr. Highmore, the lead actor, came aboard after playing Norman Bates on the A&E series \u201cBates Motel.\u201d He had a break of only a few weeks between playing a psychotic killer and a good-hearted savant who wants to save lives.\u201cHe always tries to see the good in people,\u201d Mr. Highmore said. \u201cHe\u2019s not cynical, he\u2019s not judgmental. In the times we are living in now, having someone with such a positive outlook in the world is refreshing and joyful.\u201dWhether or not the main reason for its success has to do with the times or the show itself, \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d is ABC\u2019s highest-rated first-year hit since \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d in 2004 and the best broadcast performer at 10 p.m. in the past 11 years. And now the fourth-place network has something to build on.\u201cThe way to turn a schedule around is brick by brick,\u201d Ms. Dungey said. \u201cWhat\u2019s very exciting about the success of \u2018The Good Doctor\u2019 is that it feels like that\u2019s a very strong brick for us.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the date when \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d would wrap the first half of its debut season.

Joe-style, not like us normal guys around here who have a rifle for dove hunting,\u201d said Mr. Flores, 56, who runs Theresa\u2019s Kitchen, a food stand inside the Valero station that sells burritos and tacos. \u201cThen I saw him hitting the church with bullets from the outside. It was just bam-bam-bam, the sound when a dude keeps his finger on the trigger.\u201dBy the time the shooting stopped, at least 26 people at the First Baptist Church would be dead or dying.Tears welled in Mr. Flores\u2019s eyes as he spoke on Monday about customers, friends and neighbors who were now gone, like Joann Ward, a day care provider who grew up here with his son. He looked at the ground as he recalled how Ms. Ward would always order her favorite burrito, asking him, \u201cWhere\u2019s my chorizo and egg?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no sense to these things, I guess,\u201d Mr. Flores continued, still reeling after he learned that two of Ms. Ward\u2019s young daughters, Emily and Brooke, were killed along with their mother.Residents like Mr. Flores were left trying to grasp how nearly one-tenth of a community\u2019s population could be cut down in the span of a few minutes, and how such a thing could happen in a house of worship.Everyone in Sutherland Springs seems to know the mustachioed Mr. Flores, who runs the little eatery with his girlfriend, Terrie Smith, 54. He normally greets people with a smile and relishes taking a few minutes to catch up on local gossip or talk about the weather. But the day after the shooting, Mr. Flores obsessed about the victims he knew.One friend, who died in the church with his wife, was known to Mr. Flores by a Spanish nickname: \u201cWe just called him Chiquit\u00edn\u201d \u2014 the Little Guy.\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how to deal with something like this,\u201d Mr. Flores said. \u201cAt some point, I guess I\u2019ll pray for the killer, because he needs that forgiveness, even if he\u2019s dead too. There\u2019s too much hate in the world already.\u201dAt each turn in Sutherland Springs, others were grappling with the same kind of despair on display in the parking lot of the Valero station.Bob Baker, 57, who has lived two blocks from the First Baptist Church for 26 years, said the shooting had devastated the town. He said one of his sons knew two boys on the junior high school football team who attended the church most weeks, but overslept on Sunday \u2014 and are now dealing with the wrenching emotions of accidental survivors.\u201cIn small-town South Texas, there are two things that tie people together \u2014 Friday-night football and church,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that shook people the most: You think you can go to church and you\u2019re in a safe place.\u201dMost Sundays, about 40 people would attend services at First Baptist, which can seat about 75. About half the congregation was Hispanic. Everyone knew everyone else.Parishioners said the church building had not been updated in a while. A red-carpeted center aisle divided rows of cushioned wooden pews. Hymnals were provided, but attendees brought their own Bibles. Younger congregants sometimes played contemporary Christian rock songs on electric guitars.Fredda Connally, 64, a hairstylist who lives near the church with her husband, recalled that \u201cThe Old Rugged Cross\u201d was often sung toward the end of the service. The couple knew the pastor and his wife; one of the pastor\u2019s daughters was killed in the massacre.\u201cShe was just a sweet little girl,\u201d Ms. Connally said. \u201cI\u2019ve known her since she was very small. She was playful and outgoing.\u201d The girl used to sit in the front row near her father during worship, Ms. Connally recalled.On the edge of town, just a five-minute walk from the church, a stoical homeowner welcomed a visitor for a chat in his driveway.\u201cMy name is Bill,\u201d he said in heavily accented English, waiting for a response. \u201cWell, my name is actually Kazimierz Bil. I\u2019m not originally from around here.\u201dMr. Bil, 69, said he was from Poland, and had landed in this part of Texas nearly two decades ago after hitchhiking from California. \u201cI had lived in New York, Paris, Marseilles, Rome, Warsaw,\u201d he said. \u201cBig-city guy. Never thought I\u2019d end up in a little place like this.\u201dBut he met a woman near here, got married, and became a family man and a Baptist. \u201cI used to go to the church that was attacked,\u201d Mr. Bil said. \u201cI know most of the victims: The adults. The kids. The poor little kids.\u201dHis granddaughter, Lensie Butler, had planned to attend the service at First Baptist Church on Sunday with her two children. But when she pulled into the parking lot, she realized she was an hour early \u2014 she had forgotten to set her clock back with the end of daylight saving time. So she drove to another Baptist church in nearby Stockdale. During the service there, people\u2019s phones began ringing with news of the horror in Sutherland Springs.\u201cI try to be so thankful that the Lord changed my mind when I was sitting in that parking lot,\u201d Ms. Butler wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cBut after seeing the people shot in and around the church, the mess, the people that witnessed it still in shock, covered in their loved ones\u2019 blood, I want to be kinda mad/saddened that things happened to people that didn\u2019t deserve such a thing.\u201dJust as Mr. Flores had done, Ms. Butler listed all the people she knew who were killed, though without naming them: \u201ca friend\u2019s husband and sweet baby\u201d that Ms. Butler\u2019s son, Hesston, had played with; \u201ca sweet friend expecting in April;\u201d that friend\u2019s husband\u2019s parents \u2014 all gone.\u201cSo many people\u2019s lives forever changed,\u201d Ms. Butler said. \u201cDefinitely makes you think.\u201dShe added, \u201cYou are not promised another day or hour.\u201dStaci Semrad contributed reporting from San Antonio, and Julie Turkewitz from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Women\u2019s Whisper Network Raises Its Voice", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey called themselves the Glass Ceiling Club.A group of young and ambitious women in the 1990s from the investment bank Bear Stearns would gather at local restaurants every couple of months to discuss how to make the workplace more female friendly. The conversations would inevitably turn to their male colleagues, including the ones who behaved badly, said Maureen Sherry, a former managing director, who met regularly with the other women.\u201cOf course, our conversations would revert to sharing facts we knew about the men we worked with,\u201d recalled Ms. Sherry, who spent nine years at Bear Stearns before leaving in 2000, adding, \u201cyes, it was mostly the same men who preyed on young women.\u201dFor women who had to interact with some of the most notorious sexual harassers, Ms. Sherry said she recommended they stay on the trading floor \u2014 a very public space.\u201cSurvival hints like that were shared pretty freely,\u201d Ms. Sherry wrote in an email.That was the whisper network at work.For as long as women have been in the labor force, this kind of behind-the-scenes support system has served as a vital source of shared information and a safe space for communal commiseration. Advice on salary negotiations, office politics and the work-life balance would be disseminated through informal conversations at cubicles, in cafeterias and over drinks at happy hour.But the network also allowed employees to clue each other into a spectrum of behavior that was often unseen or ignored by their employers \u2014 the boss who scoffs at maternity leave, the manager known for ribald jokes, the colleague rumored to be a groper, or worse.Now, with the internet offering a clearinghouse for complaints \u2014 intensified by the outpouring of allegations against prominent figures like the producer Harvey Weinstein \u2014 whisper networks have been amplified. Through public forums, invitation-only Facebook groups, private Google surveys, locked websites and shielded threads on anonymous apps, women \u2014 and some men \u2014 are seeking catharsis and validation by sharing their stories.\u201cWe\u2019re in this interesting period right now, kind of a hopeful period, where having prominent people name and talk about harassment has put a heightened awareness of it on the table,\u2019\u2019 said Fatima Goss Graves, chief executive of the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\u201cWhen you have one person come forward, they become a huge target,\u201d she added, \u201cbut when more people come out, it\u2019s hard to go after all of them.\u201dIn many cases, the network is driven by firsthand knowledge. Other times, it can be pure speculation. Allegations are often made anonymously and can quickly spread in online forums, damaging reputations before the accused can defend themselves. Men targeted by whisper networks complain of being subject to vigilantism and public shaming; some have threatened legal action.At Bear Stearns \u2014 which was sold to JPMorgan Chase in 2008, during the financial crisis \u2014 the Glass Ceiling Club would warn others about the senior manager who had a history of affairs and a tendency to relocate his previous liaisons to remote offices, recalled Ms. Sherry, who last year published a semi-autobiographical novel, \u201cOpening Belle,\u2019\u2019 about her experiences.The women in the whisper network \u201cweren\u2019t best girlfriends,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Sherry said.\u201cWhat we did have in common was that we were ambitious professionals with the common goal of a more equal place of employment and so yes, that included our perplexity over outrageous behavior that went unchecked.\u201cBut when the whisper network moves onto social media platforms, accusations can gather momentum and quickly yield results.In early October, a number of women came forward on Twitter to accuse Andy Signore, the creator of the popular YouTube series \u201cHonest Trailers\u201d and \u201cScreen Junkies,\u201d of sexual harassment.In a statement through his lawyer, Yana Henriks, Mr. Signore denied any allegations of sexual assault, harassment or retaliation. He said that Defy Media used the allegations made against him as an opportunity to deprive him of his ownership stake in the company.Social media helps retain and spread what Ms. Graves, of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, calls \u201cinstitutional memory.\u201d A written story is easier to pass along than a spoken one, even if the original teller is anonymous, based in another office or leaves the company, she said.The invitation-only Facebook group Tech Ladies provides information on job openings and invitations to networking events. But it also has a discussion called #HelpASisterOut where members can solicit advice about how to come forward with a harassment complaint or to ask about a company\u2019s reputation or culture.\u201cWhat we\u2019ll see is someone post that they are applying for a job at a company and ask if anyone has any good or bad stories about it,\u201d said Allison Esposito, the founder of Tech Ladies. \u201cIf it was great, you\u2019ll see that in the comments. But if it wasn\u2019t, people will say \u2018DM me\u2019 or \u2018let\u2019s take it to the phone,\u2019 to share the information.\u201dAn app called Blind allows all employees from more than 100 companies, including Google, Facebook, Amazon and Airbnb, to sign up through their work email but then chat anonymously about office and industry issues.But in the past year, Blind has also become a hotbed for frank talk about sexual harassment.Outlets now abound for women \u2014 especially younger, newer employees \u2014 who might be left out of tightly guarded cliques of trust at work.In private Facebook groups, women in the comedy profession share a list of men who have been banned from various venues across the country for inappropriate sexual behavior.The anonymity attached to some allegations has spurred debate. A Google spreadsheet that named dozens of men in the media world, identifying individuals with descriptions ranging from leering to sexual harassment to assault, drew a mixed reaction when it was publicized in October.Some applauded the public outing of the men who were accused. But others were outraged that the document had been widely disseminated, that the allegations had been made anonymously and the accused given no opportunity to defend or remove themselves from the list.For Amanda Aiken, the whisper network worked. Sort of.Ms. Aiken was a new paralegal at a small Canadian real estate investment firm when, during a company event in 2011, a top executive repeatedly tried to cajole her into going back to his home.\u201cHis entire body was touching mine \u2014 I would try to get away from him, physically move away, and he would try to follow me,\u201d she recalled in an interview.In the following days, she learned that several other female colleagues had similar stories, including her friend, Erin Carson. After word filtered up to management, the women were soon summoned to a meeting with one of the company\u2019s owners to discuss their allegations.\u201cThere was some anger, there were some tears,\u201d Ms. Carson, a receptionist at the firm in Victoria, B.C., said in an interview. \u201cBut it was kind of reassuring to know we weren\u2019t alone.\u201dThe executive left the company soon afterward. Ms. Aiken quit her job, citing a lingering feeling of awkwardness.\u201cToo many women have commented about how they just gave up because men didn\u2019t listen when we said no and we felt powerless,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to get my power back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Blocking the AT&T-Time Warner Merger Might Be Right", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut should we so quickly conclude that the Justice Department is doing something wrong? Maybe not.We don\u2019t have the information that the Justice Department has, but here\u2019s how the Time Warner-AT&T deal would be anticompetitive. AT&T is one of the two dominant wireless carriers in the United States (Verizon is the other). However, it faces competitive threats, particularly from T-Mobile, whose cost-cutting and ability to lure subscribers has hurt AT&T\u2019s profits (while saving consumers money). During the Obama era, AT&T\u2019s proposed solution to that annoyance was to attempt to buy T-Mobile. But the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission killed that deal. Acquiring Time Warner is an alternative: It gives AT&T a new way to hurt T-Mobile and other potential competitive threats.AT&T\u2019s 2016 deal with Taylor Swift offers a preview of the strategy. AT&T made an \u201conly on AT&T\u201d deal with Ms. Swift to release her future music videos to devoted fans, contingent on their signing up with AT&T. With ownership of Time Warner, AT&T gets a lot more content with which to play that game. It would include HBO shows like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Warner Bros. movies like the \u201cBatman\u201d franchise, as well as the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and CNN.Though restricting HBO to just AT&T customers wouldn\u2019t make financial sense, there are many things that AT&T could do with HBO and other programming to hurt rivals, like raising the prices for it, creating AT&T-exclusive programming and perhaps completely preventing rivals like Dish, DirecTV\u2019s satellite competitor, from buying its programs. This strategy would take advantage of the erosion or revocation of net-neutrality rules by the Trump administration, allowing AT&T to explicitly favor its own content over others.There are numerous political and free speech concerns that come when those who control \u201cthe pipes\u201d that distribute content also control the programming and news operations. Companies that controlled both the distribution and production of news programs could have enough power to influence elections. In theory, the F.C.C. should intervene to prevent such abuses, but the current commission has shown zero interest in what was once called \u201cthe public interest.\u201dIn short, there are good reasons for the Justice Department to be concerned about this merger. Yes, the department over the past two decades has allowed many mega-mergers or taken tepid steps to restrict them through consent decrees. But the department is capable of learning from its mistakes, and the consensus now is that consent decrees don\u2019t work. Moreover, in recent years the department has blocked several big mergers, including between Comcast and Time Warner Cable, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, and Anthem and Cigna. Tough scrutiny of an AT&T-Time Warner deal would continue that trend.The unfortunate fact is that Mr. Trump has engendered so much distrust in government that everything that any federal agency does these days seems questionable. The problem is compounded by the extreme secrecy that has surrounded merger reviews. In fact, the secrecy surrounding mergers exceeds that for almost any other public process with major economic impact. Even the Federal Reserve occasionally explains its decisions to Congress.If the Justice Department is, in fact, doing its job appropriately and not behaving as Mr. Trump\u2019s henchman, it should be willing to show us how. It ought to explain its concerns about the merger to the public and to Congress.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the companies in a merger blocked by the Justice Department. The attempted merger would have been of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, not Comcast and Time Warner.Tim Wu, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads,\u201d is a professor at Columbia Law School and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Whether we get covered through an employer or the Affordable Care Act exchanges, we\u2019ll be told to carefully review our options to find a plan that will give us the best coverage for the least amount of money.We will be told we need to shop.Make it stop!This is not shopping. Shopping is a fun activity, like choosing a pie from the bakery or picking out cereal at the supermarket. The farthest thing from \u201cshopping\u201d is the arduous annual ritual of reviewing the complex and all but impossible to decipher health insurance options.Plus, we have choices when we do the real kind of shopping. If we don\u2019t like the luggage in one store, we can always head to another. But if we don\u2019t like the health insurance options our employer selects, or the options on the local exchange \u2014 well, short of changing jobs or moving, we\u2019re stuck. That\u2019s hardly the definition of consumer empowerment.Isn\u2019t it absurd to describe us as shoppers? When I go shopping at the mall, I get perfume samples and free chocolates. When I consider health insurance plans, I am offered no such things.Moreover, 326 million Americans cannot combat our high-cost medical system with one savvy purchase. The term prioritizes the values of the marketplace and financial world. It also signals that instead of contemplating how to make the medical-industrial complex work for us, our energy is channeled into getting the best deal we can from a system that\u2019s designed not for our benefit, but to extract the greatest amount of profit from every patient.Health care is much more than a mere consumer item, even if we do spend money to get it. It\u2019s fundamental to our lives. So hear me out. Whether you are a reporter on deadline, an insurance official discussing plans or someone reviewing your options, just say people should \u201cchoose\u201d or \u201cpick\u201d a plan.

Mr. Bonilla attributed that rise to Facebook, which is based nearby and was growing.So Mr. Bonilla, a 43-year-old mechanic and Uber driver, bought a 1991 recreational vehicle and joined a family-oriented R.V. community on a quiet cul-de-sac. They lived there until last week, when Mr. Bonilla received an eviction notice.This time, Mr. Bonilla said, the reason he had to move was because the city wanted to clear the way for \u201cthe Facebook school.\u201d That school is funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company set up by Facebook\u2019s co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, to work on social change endeavors. Ms. Chan is a co-founder of the school, a private institution for low-income children called the Primary School.Despite the good will behind the school, it has been met with wariness.\u201cThe school is a Facebook school. It\u2019s not a city school,\u201d Mr. Bonilla said, adding that he knew he would have to move again when he heard about it. \u201cWhen Facebook comes, everybody moves everywhere.\u201dFor many in East Palo Alto, which is just blocks from Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., no C.E.O. and company have come to embody the anxieties of the modern tech boom more than Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook. At a meeting last Wednesday at East Palo Alto\u2019s City Hall, about 100 residents and protesters gathered with city staff to discuss their housing and some invoked Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s name.\u201cI want to talk about the elephant in the room,\u201d said Zach Kirk, 20, a Stanford University student who grew up in Palo Alto. \u201cActually, he\u2019s not in the room, he\u2019s in some mansion: Mark Zuckerberg.\u201dCommunity members expect more tension later this month at an East Palo Alto town hall hosted by Real Community Coalition, a local citizens group, and featuring Facebook. At the meeting, residents will have the opportunity to ask Facebook executives questions about the company\u2019s role in the community.\u201cConnections are at the core of everything we do at Facebook and our relationship with residents of East Palo Alto is no different,\u201d Juan Salazar, a public policy manager for Facebook, said in a statement.The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which is also writing grants for affordable housing, said working side by side with local communities was \u201ccore to our work.\u201d In a statement, the Primary School said the episode with the R.V. residents was \u201cfrustrating and emblematic of larger housing issues in the Bay Area,\u201d but that it was not aware of East Palo Alto\u2019s action to evict those residents and had not engaged with city officials on the matter.\u201cCZI\u2019s just walking into something with a lot of baggage,\u201d said Daniel Saver, a lawyer with the Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, which receives funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. \u201cPeople here have been pushed around by very big interests and have been taken advantage of for decades. \u201dPaul Bains, a pastor and president of Project WeHope, a local organization funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, said that the initiative needed to figure out how to interact with wary residents. \u201cThey have to learn how to communicate with communities of color,\u201d Mr. Bains said.The recent evictions at the R.V. enclave were not requested by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, said Donna Rutherford, an East Palo Alto City Council member and a former mayor of the town. Instead, city officials said the area had become a flood hazard as rains were coming and the vehicles had spilled wastewater into storm drains.\u201cLet me just walk you through the gross part,\u201d said Michelle Daher, an environmental management analyst for East Palo Alto, heading to a storm drain last week where she said 6,000 gallons of waste from R.V.s had to be pumped one day.Ms. Daher pointed out the future site of the school, an empty lot surrounded by a chain-link fence. \u201cThis obviously is the Chan Zuckerberg location,\u201d she said. She added that the flood-prone street would be rebuilt for the school, so the R.V.s would have had to move in any case.Sean Charpentier, East Palo Alto\u2019s assistant city manager, said the region had been squeezed by the wealth around it and that the homeless population had grown. \u201cWe\u2019re a receptacle for the externalities around us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s felt more deeply here because this city was formed to provide safe and affordable housing.\u201dPatricia Lopez, 48, who owns a home on the street where the R.V.s were parked, said the trouble for the R.V. residents began after a community meeting that Facebook executives attended.\u201cThey didn\u2019t introduce themselves, but the organizer said, \u2018Facebook is in the house,\u2019 and they waved. And ever since then, it\u2019s been heavy harassment, heavy policing,\u201d she said, which ultimately led to the evictions.At last week\u2019s City Hall meeting, residents and protesters expressed support for the school but anxiety over the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\u201cThe first step is to make sure quasi-affiliated supposed philanthropic organizations don\u2019t set the policy,\u201d said Johannes Muenzel, 28, a software engineer who is the co-chairman of Silicon Valley\u2019s Democratic Socialists of America chapter.Mr. Kirk, the Stanford student, stood in the back, organizing other students. He said he had never seen so much grass-roots energy to protest among his cohort.\u201cIt\u2019s sprung up out of nowhere. This is the issue we need to focus on,\" he said, adding that it was remarkable to get so many Stanford students protesting on a school night.By 11 p.m., protesters and city staff were getting agitated and tired. Eventually, the Public Works and Transportation Commission recommended that city staff pursue a long-term solution for the R.V. community by working with nonprofit organizations and by looking into a ban on oversize vehicles parking overnight.Facebook said a senior executive attended the meeting. Nearly 50 community members spoke that night. The Facebook executive did not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dueling Appointments Lead to Clash at Consumer Protection Bureau", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump on Friday named his budget director as the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, moving to take control of the agency hours after its departing leader had taken steps to install his own choice for acting chief.By the end of the night, an agency born of the financial meltdown \u2014 and one Republicans have tried to kill from the start \u2014 had dueling directors, and there was little sense of who actually would be in charge Monday morning.The bureaucratic standoff began Friday afternoon when Richard Cordray, the Obama-appointed leader of the bureau, abruptly announced he would leave the job at the close of business, a week earlier than anticipated. He followed up with a letter naming his chief of staff, Leandra English, as the agency\u2019s deputy director.The announcement came with a twist. Under the law, he said, that appointment would make the new deputy director the agency\u2019s acting director. The move was seen as an effort to delay Mr. Trump from appointing his own director, whose confirmation could take months.The White House retaliated, saying that the budget director, Mick Mulvaney, who once characterized the consumer protection bureau as a \u201csad, sick joke,\u201d would be running the agency. He would also keep his current job as head of the Office of Management and Budget.Mr. Mulvaney said he would assume the additional role until a permanent successor was found.\u201cI believe Americans deserve a C.F.P.B. that seeks to protect them while ensuring free and fair markets for all consumers,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFinancial services are the engine of American democratic capitalism, and we need to let it work.\u201dIn a letter to the consumer protection agency\u2019s staff, Mr. Cordray named Ms. English as deputy director. Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which established the regulatory agency, the deputy director is to serve as acting director in the absence of a permanent leader, Mr. Cordray said.The conflicting appointments were a fitting development for an agency under constant attack from Republican leaders, and it leaves supporters wondering about the agency\u2019s future with Mr. Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of both houses of Congress.The bureau was proposed in 2007 by Elizabeth Warren, then a Harvard law professor, but she was passed over to lead the agency after Obama administration officials became concerned that she would not be able to overcome resistance from Republicans during the confirmation process.Instead, President Barack Obama chose Mr. Cordray, a former attorney general of Ohio whom Ms. Warren had picked to be the agency\u2019s enforcement director. But for two years, Republicans prevented the confirmation of a director to lead the agency. The agency\u2019s creation was also largely opposed by the banking industry, which sought to prevent Mr. Cordray\u2019s confirmation.In July 2013, the Senate finally agreed to allow the confirmation of Mr. Cordray, cementing a new era of expansive federal oversight of companies that lend money to consumers.The fight over the establishment of the protection bureau made Ms. Warren a political celebrity and helped her win a bid for Congress. Later, as a senator from Massachusetts, Ms. Warren has continued to champion the bureau, which has emerged as an aggressive consumer watchdog with broad power to combat financial abuses.Consumer groups quickly praised Mr. Cordray, whose move appeared to be a final attempt to keep the bureau in hands that would preserve the legacy he helped create as its first director.\u201cFortunately, the statute creating the C.F.P.B. says that the agency\u2019s deputy director serves as acting director until a new director has been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate,\u201d Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, said in a statement. \u201cMulvaney has said he is opposed to the very existence of the C.F.P.B., and as a member of Congress he voted in favor of Wall Street banks and predatory lenders \u2014 his largest donors \u2014 again and again.\u201dThe appointment of Mr. Mulvaney, who as a Republican congressman from South Carolina was a co-sponsor of legislation to shut down the consumer bureau, had been widely anticipated. The White House said in a statement on Friday that President Trump looked forward to seeing Mr. Mulvaney take a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d to leading the bureau\u2019s staff.The bureau, with its reputation as an active watchdog for the financial rights of consumers, has been a major obstacle to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle regulations.Mr. Trump would have been free to make major changes at the agency as he has done at other financial regulators \u2014 many of which are run by former executives \u2014 but Mr. Cordray\u2019s surprise move may complicate those plans. And what happens next is not entirely clear.Instead, the agency\u2019s next director may potentially face at least some of the resistance Mr. Cordray experienced from Republicans after he was named director.Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s appointment was met with opposition by consumer groups.\u201cNaming Mick Mulvaney \u2014 someone who\u2019s adamantly anti-consumer \u2014 rewards financial predators and fails to put consumers first,\u201d Michael Calhoun, the president of the Center for Responsible Lending, said in a statement.Ms. English is no stranger to the consumer protection bureau. She helped start the agency in 2011, working in several roles before leaving to join the Office of Management and Budget, according to the bureau\u2019s website. She returned in January 2015 as deputy chief operating officer, left to work at the Office of Personnel Management and returned again in January 2017 as the bureau\u2019s chief of staff.Ms. English has a bachelor\u2019s degree from New York University and a master\u2019s degree from the London School of Economics.One of the names that had been floated for the bureau\u2019s top post was Todd J. Zywicki, a conservative law professor at George Mason University.Andy Parsons and Nathan Willis contributed reporting from Washington, and Emily Cochrane from West Palm Beach, Fla.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington Has Delivered a Tangled Message on AT&T\u2019s Power", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "Loosening rules on internet providers would let big companies charge more for their services. But a suit to block a merger signals a tougher stance against big business.Supported byIn a matter of hours this week, the Trump administration twice weighed in on one of the central issues shaping business and society today \u2014 just how much market power big companies should be allowed to amass.Yet in back-to-back developments, two federal agencies arrived at starkly different conclusions, and one company, AT&T, found itself on opposite sides of the debate.In each development, there are signs that the Trump administration is trying to reckon with a media and telecommunications industry that has become intensely concentrated in recent years; most Americans now get their internet and phone services from one of a few providers, and most TV shows and movies are produced by a handful of big companies.But there is so far no clear view about how Washington will navigate this constantly shifting terrain in the future.\u201cWe have one government, but two separate agencies with opposing views,\u201d said Spencer Kurn, an analyst at New Street Research. \u201cYou\u2019ve got one agency saying that marrying content and distribution results in too much market power, and another agency saying there\u2019s no problem with a distributor favoring their content over someone else\u2019s.\u201dAT&T stands to gain from the rollback of net neutrality rules. It could charge companies and consumers more for high-speed internet access, and use its market influence to hinder content providers it competes against.\u201cIt\u2019s an \u2018open the champagne bottles\u2019 moment for AT&T,\u201d said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia University who coined the term net neutrality \u2014 the concept of providing equal access to the internet. \u201cThey can just tell people to pony up.\u201dBut AT&T\u2019s long-term aspirations could be dealt a severe blow if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking its takeover of Time Warner.On Tuesday, President Trump signaled his approval of the lawsuit. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve always felt that that was a deal that\u2019s not good for the country,\u201d he said in response to a question from reporters. If the merger was approved, he suggested, \u201cI think your pricing is going to go up.\u201dFor all the good a rollback of net neutrality rules would do AT&T, the company is looking to diversify. Its core businesses of delivering phone, internet and satellite television services are maturing. A big move into the content business would expand the company\u2019s sources of revenue, and give it new opportunities for cost savings.One of AT&T\u2019s biggest competitors, Comcast, has already married content and distribution with the acquisition of NBCUniversal. If the government succeeds in preventing the Time Warner deal, it will raise sharp questions about the future of AT&T, and its competitors.\u201cThis could be a watershed event for future business combinations in media,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. \u201cDoes this mean Comcast will be broken up?\u201dThere is no evidence that the decisions by the Justice Department and the F.C.C. were coordinated.Instead, the diverging decisions reflect an effort by different agencies trying to come to grips with a radically transformed media and telecommunications landscape, one where Silicon Valley companies are suddenly powerhouses in content creation, and traditional media companies exert vast influence over how information flows across the internet.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely getting mixed messages from the administration,\u201d said Larry Downes, project director for the Center for Business and Public Policy at Georgetown University.The Justice Department\u2019s decision to intervene in the AT&T deal was the more surprising of the two developments this week. Many antitrust experts believe that the government\u2019s case against the deal is weak, because it is a so-called vertical merger, bringing together two businesses that do not compete directly with each other.But the lawsuit is a sign that the Justice Department is beginning to think about antitrust enforcement in fundamentally new ways.The decision by the F.C.C. to roll back net neutrality rules was less surprising, but has equally far-reaching implications. With less regulation, big internet providers will be able to charge more for their services, extract new fees from websites and block content.\u201cThe F.C.C. is saying that they\u2019re going to give up any legal authority over regulating high-speed internet,\u201d said Susan Crawford, a professor at Harvard Law School. \u201cThey\u2019re handing the power to choose winners and losers online to about five companies.\u201dDespite the seeming irreconcilability of the moves by the Justice Department and the F.C.C., some see a common narrative in the two decisions.\u201cThey\u2019re both defense strategies against Silicon Valley,\u201d Mr. Wu said.By rolling back net neutrality, the government is giving old-school media companies like AT&T and Comcast more leverage over companies like Netflix, Google and Facebook that are increasingly becoming their competitors. And by challenging the AT&T merger with Time Warner, the Justice Department could be laying the groundwork for a new approach to antitrust enforcement that could be used to go after big technology firms.Barry Diller, the media mogul and chairman of IAC, which owns a host of websites including Match.com and Vimeo, cited the power of tech companies in expressing exasperation at the Justice Department suit.\u201cIf you think AT&T has too much market power because of distribution, tell me what happens if you are Facebook and Google, which have unbelievable concentration in distribution,\u201d Mr. Diller said. \u201cHow would you ever be able to get a content addition to Google?\u201dAnd there is another school of thought suggesting that more vigorous antitrust enforcement might have obviated the need for net neutrality rules in the first place.If regulators had been stricter about ensuring robust competition among internet service providers over the years, the theory goes, big firms like AT&T would not be able to operate in ways that harm competition.\u201cNet neutrality was a distant-second-best remedy,\u201d Mr. Sagers said. \u201cIf we could have competition in internet service provision, that would have been way better than relying on the F.C.C.\u201dEven if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking AT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner, the opportunity to use antitrust enforcement as a means to give consumers more choice among internet providers has likely passed. And now, by unwinding net neutrality rules, Mr. Sagers said, the Trump administration will make it easier for big companies like AT&T to maintain the already enormous power it has amassed through earlier consolidation.\u201cIf you want to have a monopoly,\u201d he said, \u201cthe government can be your best friend.\u201dJohn Koblin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "They Quietly Left the Church, but the Sexual Abuse Continued", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe public disclosure of eight of the likely dozens of priests who have sexually abused children in the Brooklyn diocese over the decades was met with a mixture of praise and frustration from victims and their advocates on Friday. While they were gratified that the disclosures would probably protect additional children, they noted that this was nowhere near a full accounting of clergy sex abuse in the diocese.\u201cI\u2019m encouraged by the release of eight names \u2014 I do think it\u2019s good,\u201d said Michael Reck, a lawyer who is representing two of the victims of Romano J. Ferraro, among the eight former priests named on Thursday. \u201cBut this is a trickle compared to the flood that they are holding back.\u201dCarolyn Erstad, a spokeswoman for the diocese, said Friday that it had chosen to release the names of living priests who had been formally defrocked by the Vatican because they could still be a danger to children. She said it was not releasing the names of dead priests who had been defrocked because they were no longer a threat.She did not address why the diocese was withholding the names of abusers who had been named by victims in successful abuse settlements, but who had not been formally laicized. Not all abusive priests are laicized; that process at the Vatican is long and does not always result in the loss of a clerical state.\u201cThis is about releasing the names of people who may have access to children,\u201d she said, adding that the diocese anticipated more names would added to the list next week.She noted that the diocese now routinely shares all allegations of abuse with law enforcement, and that it had done so since 2002, when reforms were passed nationally in the Roman Catholic Church to protect children. Before that, it was common to withhold allegations of abuse from law enforcement. She also noted that the diocese had previously publicly acknowledged substantiated allegations against priests.Of the eight men named Thursday, the most notorious was Mr. Ferraro, who is believed to have been one of the most prolific priest pedophiles on the Eastern Seaboard, and one of whom the most is known.In 1981, Anthony Bevilacqua, then a high-ranking Brooklyn chancery official, who later became the cardinal archbishop of Philadelphia, facilitated Mr. Ferraro\u2019s move to a Missouri parish, where he was later accused of molesting children. He also allegedly abused boys in the dioceses of Rockville Centre and Metuchen, N.J.He was formally removed from ministry in 1988, and in 2004, was convicted of child sexual assault for raping a Massachusetts boy in the 1970s. He is now serving a life sentence in a medium-security prison in Bridgewater, Mass. Throughout his career, from 1960 to 1988, he was officially a priest of the Diocese of Brooklyn.Although the diocese identified the eight former priests, it is impossible to know in most of the cases when the diocese knew about the abuse and what it did about it. The church\u2019s brief statement only says what years they served as active priests, and not when the laicizations took place, or when the first allegations came in.Charles M. Mangini went on to live in Old Bridge, N.J. after his removal from ministry in 1993. Reached at home on Thursday, the 79-year-old affirmed in a cheery voice that he had been a priest in Brooklyn. He quickly changed his tone when told why the diocese had just posted his name.Christopher Lee Coleman, now 61, who was removed from ministry in 2011, still maintains a Facebook page, and a LinkedIn page that makes it seem as if he is a priest. \u201cI live a vowed life. Ordained 21 May 1994, Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn,\u201d it says.Anthony Hughes, 42, a clergy sex abuse victim from the diocese who regularly participates in activities it holds for abuse survivors, said Friday that it was a \u201cfabulous idea\u201d that the names were being released, and that he hoped there would be more. When told that the diocese was not planning on releasing the names of deceased priests, he then volunteered the name of the deceased priest who abused him.Advertisement"}

Though the details and philosophies vary from place to place, the general notion is that the government hands out regular checks to everyone, regardless of income or whether people are working. The money ensures food and shelter for all, while removing the stigma of public support.Some posit basic income as a way to let market forces work their ruthless magic, delivering innovation and economic growth, while laying down a cushion for those who fail. Others present it as a means of liberating people from wretched, poverty-level jobs, allowing workers to organize for better conditions or devote time to artistic exploits.

A similar test is underway in Barcelona, Spain.As a concept, basic income has been kicked around in various guises for centuries, gaining adherents across a strikingly broad swath of the ideological spectrum, from the English social philosopher Thomas More to the American revolutionary Thomas Paine.The populist firebrand Louisiana governor Huey Long, the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., and the laissez faire economist Milton Friedman would presumably agree on little, yet all advocated some version of basic income.Not everyone loves the idea. Conservatives fret that handing out money free of obligation will turn people into dole-dependent slackers.In the American context, any talk of a truly universal form of basic income also collides with arithmetic. Give every American $10,000 a year \u2014 a sum still below the poverty line for an individual \u2014 and the tab runs to $3 trillion a year. That is about eight times what the United States now spends on social service programs. Conversation over.Labor-oriented economists in the United States are especially wary of basic income, given that the American social safety programs have been significantly trimmed in recent decades, with welfare, unemployment benefits and food stamps all subject to a variety of restrictions. If basic income were to replace these components as one giant program \u2014 the proposal that would appeal to libertarians \u2014 it might beckon as a fat target for additional budget trimming.And some advocates for working people dismiss basic income as a wrongheaded approach to the real problem of not enough quality paychecks.\u201cPeople want to work,\u201d said the Nobel laureate economist Joseph E. Stiglitz when I asked him about basic income early this year. \u201cThey don\u2019t want handouts.\u201dYet some of the basic income experiments now underway are engineered precisely to encourage people to work while limiting their contact with public assistance.Finland\u2019s trial is giving jobless people the same amount of money they were already receiving in unemployment benefits, while relieving them of bureaucratic obligations. The bet is that people will use time now squandered submitting paperwork to train for better careers, start businesses, or take part-time jobs. Under the system the trial replaces, people living on benefits risk losing support if they secure other income.In short, basic income is being advanced not as a license for Finns to laze in the sauna, but as a means of enhancing the forces of creative destruction so central to capitalism. As the logic goes, once sustenance is eliminated as a worry, weak companies can be shuttered without concern for those thrown out of work, freeing up capital and talent for more productive ventures.The trials in the Netherlands, conducted at the municipal level, are similarly geared to paring bureaucracy from the unemployment system. Ditto, the Barcelona experiment.Silicon Valley has embraced basic income as a crucial element in enabling the continued rollout of automation. While engineers pioneer ways to replace human laborers with robots, financiers focus on basic income as a replacement for paychecks.The trial in Oakland was the work of Y Combinator, a start-up incubator. Its researchers handed out varying grants to a few dozen people as a simple feasibility test for basic income.The next phase is far more ambitious. The Y Combinator researchers plan to distribute grants to 3,000 people with below-average incomes in two as-yet undisclosed American states. They will hand out $1,000 a month to 1,000 people, no strings attached, and $50 a month to the rest, allowing for comparisons in how recipients use the money, and what impact it has on their lives.One key element of the basic income push is the assumption that poor people are better placed than bureaucrats to determine the most beneficial use of aid money. Rather than saddle recipients with complex rules and a dizzying array of programs, better to just give people money and let them sort out how to use it.This is a central idea of GiveDirectly\u2019s program in Kenya, where it began a pilot study last year in which it handed out small, unconditional cash grants \u2014 about $22 a month \u2014 to residents of a single village. The program is now expanding its sights, with plans to hand out grants to some 16,000 people in 120 villages.From a research standpoint, these remain early days for basic income, a time for experimentation and assessment before serious amounts of money may be devoted to a new model for public assistance.Yet from a political standpoint, basic income appears to have found its moment, one delivered by the anxieties of the working poor combined with those of the wealthy, who see in widening inequality the potential for mobs wielding pitchforks.\u201cThe interest is exploding everywhere,\u201d said Guy Standing, a research associate at SOAS University of London. \u201cThe debates now are extraordinarily fertile.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of money that researchers with Y Combinator plan to give 3,000 people as part of a study. While 1,000 people will receive $1,000 a month, the rest will receive $50 a month, not $500 a month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Fix Australia\u2019s Paralyzed Parliament", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe BreakdownAnd now, Australia\u2019s democracy is essentially paralyzed, or at least hobbled.Here are a few possibilities:Arjuna Dibley, an Australian doctoral student at Stanford University Law School, has proposed a nomination form that would ask questions about where the parents of a potential political candidate were born.Inspired by work with a lab that applies design principles to public institutions, the document that Mr. Dibley has proposed would help overcome a main cause of the dual citizen problem: people who don\u2019t understand the law relating to citizenship, or the flow of citizenship from a parent.\u201cBy simply asking that question, the idea would be that candidate would think about that issue,\u201d he said.Drawing on behavioral psychology research, he also suggested moving the declaration to the top of the form, which could prompt candidates to consider their answers more carefully.Kim Rubenstein, a law professor at Australian National University, has advocated something similar.\u201cIt would be helpful if it was clearer in the nomination form what they need to do to establish whether they fall under Section 44,\u201d she said, referring to the part of the Constitution on eligibility requirements. Requiring extra documentation might in itself prompt candidates to look deeper, even if those documents were not vetted, she said. \u201cThis would be a way to assist the candidate in ensuring they have done what they need to do.\u201dStill, others say changing the form would not tackle the original problem \u2014 candidates being ineligible to run \u2014 as submitting it is the last stage of the nomination process.\u201cIn many cases, it will be too late, by the time you get to the form,\u201d said Anne Twomey, a constitutional law professor at the University of Sydney. \u201cThe reality is people need to make these arrangements and check their qualifications or disqualifications well before you get to the date of nomination.\u201dWhat would be more useful, she said, would be a pamphlet that explicitly lays out the relevant cases and rules involving Section 44.Either way, these proposals share a simple, obvious premise: Force candidates to pay closer attention to their eligibility for office.The most wide-reaching solution is also the hardest to pull off.Repealing the dual citizenship restriction, which dates from the Constitution that took effect in 1901, would require a nationwide referendum.Some experts say a repeal of Section 44 is nonetheless a viable solution.\u201cIf you could get that bipartisan support, I do think you should actually have a strong chance of repealing,\u201d Professor Rubenstein said.Australians, some scholars argue, would most likely recognize that the citizenship rules are no longer a valid test of national loyalty in a multicultural country in a globalized world.\u201cI don\u2019t think being a dual citizen is a conflict,\u201d Professor Rubenstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s like parenthood: You can have more than one child without having it undermine your sense of commitment to any of your children.\u201dThe most novel answer of them all: Do your homework before pursuing politics.Many Australians have emphasized that Parliament would be busy this week if would-be lawmakers and their parties were more diligent about investigating their eligibility for the job.The opposition Labor Party, for example, has more a stringent selection process for candidates, so its lawmakers have so far avoided the resignation wave that has hamstrung Mr. Turnbull\u2019s Liberal Party and some minor parties.Professor Twomey and Professor Rubenstein said that the Labor Party went further in asking questions about potential citizenship clashes and family history.The Liberal Party, however, has yet to agree on a solution that would scrutinize candidates in advance, instead favoring self-reporting by lawmakers after they have been elected.The consensus, if there is one, seems to be clear: Australia needs to find a way to make politicians more studious, self-reflective and honest.\u201cPoliticians of parties need to be more organized and make sure their candidates are telling the truth and doing all the right things in advance,\u201d Professor Twomey said. \u201cIn the scheme of things, it\u2019s not that hard.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seven Bizarre Notions Trump and His Team Have About America", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump, his motley crew of White House and cabinet ideologues, and many other Republicans claim to have a better understanding of American values, traditions and history than the rest of us. They are the \u201creal Americans,\u201d as the historically illiterate Sarah Palin loved to say many times a day.But a great many of their notions about America are deeply puzzling at best and, at worst, truly scary ideas infused with racism and intolerance of dissent.More recently, John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, told Laura Ingraham on Fox News that the \u201clack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War.\u201dIt might be tempting to write Kelly\u2019s remarks off as the ravings of a man whose boss must drive him crazy on a daily basis and who had earlier talked of a mythical time when women in America were held \u201csacred\u201d (by blocking their career aspirations and paying them less than men, denying them birth control and access to abortions, and refusing them the right to vote for more than a half-century after the Civil War).But Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, picked up Kelly\u2019s false history the next day. There was, she said, \u201cpretty strong consensus\u201d among people from \u201cthe left, the right, the North and the South\u201d that a failure to compromise caused the war.Asked about that later, Sanders said, \u201cIf you want to go after General Kelly, that\u2019s up to you, but I think if you want to get into a debate with a four-star Marine general, I think that\u2019s something highly inappropriate.\u201dBecause, of course, there is a \u201csacred\u201d tradition that people with four stars on their uniform\u2019s shoulders are unassailably honest and decent. Like, for example, William Westmoreland, who lied for years to the American people about the course of the war in Vietnam. Or Alexander Haig, who as secretary of state declared that he was in charge of the White House when Ronald Reagan was shot by a would-be assassin.Gen. Curtis Lemay, who ran for vice president with George Wallace in 1968, once said, \u201cThere are no innocent civilians\u201d and that \u201cit doesn\u2019t bother me so much to be killing the so-called innocent bystanders.\u201dWaterboarding was considered torture by the United States and most of the rest of the planet from the Spanish Inquisition until President George W. Bush declared for self-serving reasons that it was not torture.A month later, Trump said \u201cmost people don\u2019t even know\u201d that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican and suggested that \u201cwe have to build that up a little more.\u201d Again, third-grade history. And I challenge you to find a modern-day Republican who has not at some point referred to his or her party as \u201cthe party of Lincoln.\u201dApart from the fact that human trafficking has been subject of intense discussion for many years, the Trumpian history ignores far worse examples \u2014 like, say, slavery.Our historian in chief might want to run that one by his buddy Vladimir Putin, who thinks, as many Russians do, that the long and bloody fight his country waged against Hitler was what made it possible to end the war after six years.There are many more examples. But the grim truth is that as bad as Trump\u2019s offenses are against history, his offenses against our times are worse.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Ugly Baby, the Name Isn\u2019t All That\u2019s Unusual", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review7 PhotosIt was the perfect dessert for a meal we hadn\u2019t eaten yet, I decided, just as the next dish touched down. This was kang hoh, rice vermicelli tangled up with tender pork in a tamarind-soured dry curry from northern Thailand. The bits of fried pork skin on top, curled like Fritos, gave me something to munch on while I wondered how much of my tongue the curry would shut down.Kang kua supparod is one of them. The menu terms it a mushroom pineapple curry, but you will get a sharper idea if you picture mushroom slices and squares of pressed tofu paddling around in a creamy yellow sauce of crushed pineapple and coconut milk. You can see the lime leaves that flavor it, but you only taste the lemongrass, galangal, chiles and other complications.Another is a kao tod nom klook, a warm rice salad with roots in Laos. The rice is cooked with a dry curry and a nontrivial quantity of chiles, then seared to imprint a chewy, golden crust on it. Stirred with short bits of long beans, cilantro, mint, peanuts and, crucially, some tangy pink crumbles of fermented pork sausage, it performs best when wrapped in lettuce with a basil leaf, a dried chile and anything else you happen to discover on the plate.Ugly Baby is in Carroll Gardens, across Smith Street from the hole in the earth where the F and G tracks begin to climb toward their high-rise crawl over the Gowanus Canal. Open since August, the restaurant traces its lineage back to two restaurants that had brief lives not far away in Red Hook. One, Chiang Mai, a pop-up inside another establishment, was supposed to be temporary. The other, Kao Soy, wasn\u2019t, but the two owners found that their partnership was not built for the long haul.What the three restaurants share is Sirichai Sreparplarn. He shared chef duties at the first two and takes the wheel himself at Ugly Baby, which is named after the Thai superstition that evil spirits won\u2019t bother harming unattractive infants. The walls are painted in a James Rosenquist palette with quick, energetic brush strokes. The cooks and servers wear cartoon colored T-shirts, sneakers and aprons, except for the younger cook whose apron is printed with a monochromatic photograph of hand-lettered cassettes. There\u2019s buzzy guitar pop playing at volumes that can make the restaurant sound like a bar, even though the refrigerator at the entrance to the open kitchen isn\u2019t stocked with wine and beer yet.In his larb, made with duck in the style of the Isan city of Udon Thani, smashed dried chiles do not so much coat the meat as embed themselves in it. As you chew, you summon up new waves of heat that the fresh leaves of Vietnamese coriander and bites of raw cabbage and cucumbers can do only so much to mitigate.Its only rival for sheer atomic power comes from southern Thailand. Kua kling is a beef curry that is stir-fried until it is completely dry and there is almost no hope of separating the meat from the chiles. Mr. Sreparplarn\u2019s version is cooked with needles of lime leaf and clusters of green peppercorns on their stalks. I tasted them right away, although it took five minutes before I was able to tell anybody about it.Southern Thai cooking isn\u2019t all scorched earth, though. Ugly Baby has a soothing fried sea bream rubbed with fresh turmeric and garlic, a favorite way to cook fish in that part of the country. Another calming seafood dish, this one from central Thailand, looks like a soup, but its tea-colored broth \u2014 soured with tamarind and brightened by sticks of ginger \u2014 is simply meant to flavor the fillets of red snapper in it, and keep them hot.Some of these dishes are rare in New York. You can\u2019t say that about the grilled chicken skewers marinated in coconut-peanut sauce, but Ugly Baby\u2019s might be the best available version of the dish, made with meaty thighs instead of stringy white meat.Like Mr. Sreparplarn\u2019s first two restaurants, Ugly Baby serves a rich kao soy, with beef in the coconut broth instead of chicken this time. I have to admit that I miss the crisp haystack of fried noodles and green papaya fritters that the first restaurant piled on top, and I wish Mr. Sreparplarn added in more pickled mustard greens and less chile oil (or served condiments on the side and let you decide how sour and spicy to make the soup, as Kao Soy did).The one dessert, when it is available, is rice pudding with durian. You may love this. Or, like me, you may try a spoonful to see if you still think durian tastes like boiled pearl onions. (Yes.) Or you may want to keep your distance. If you\u2019re in that group, and you haven\u2019t ordered the coconut mini-muffins, now\u2019s your chance.Advertisement"}

Since 2009, DST Global has invested $7 billion in the consumer internet sector, with a majority being invested in non-U.S. companies \u2014 and with less than 5% coming from VTB Bank. VTB Bank was the only Russian government institution that invested in any DST Global funds.In addition, all investors in DST Global \u2014 including Mr. Usmanov, VTB Bank, and a number of sovereign wealth funds from all over the world \u2014 are passive investors. That means they are simply committing funds to be invested by DST Global in companies of DST Global\u2019s choosing, and they have no influence over what companies DST Global chooses to invest in or any other decision-making.DST Global, for its part, was also a passive investor in Facebook and Twitter, meaning that it did not seek any board seats or have any influence on these companies\u2019 operations and management. Moreover, there were dozens of DST Global investors making up the funds that invested in Facebook and Twitter \u2014 Mr. Usmanov was just one of 50 passive investors in DST Global\u2019s fund that invested in Facebook, and VTB Bank was one of 40 passive investors in the DST Global fund that invested in Twitter.Finally, DST Global divested its position in Facebook in 2013 and in Twitter in 2014, shortly after each of those companies\u2019 initial public offerings and well before the 2016 U.S. elections.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pizza Is Partisan, and Advertisers Are Still Adjusting", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingIn today\u2019s political climate, even pizza, bourbon and coffee can be partisan issues.A year after the presidential election, a range of advertisers are learning that it doesn\u2019t take much \u2014 sometimes just a single Twitter post \u2014 to land them in the middle of a social media firestorm that splits along party lines. In some cases, they land there even if they\u2019ve done nothing. And it has become clear in the past month that long-used strategies for how brands should respond to the ensuing outrage may need rewriting.The statements made on our earnings call were describing the factors that impact our business and we sincerely apologize to anyone that thought they were divisive. That definitely was not our intention. (1/3)\u201cWhat I think is constantly surprising is how polarized and divisive, certainly, the U.S. has become,\u201d said Ken Kraemer, the chief executive of the agency Deep Focus. Brands are shifting from a world where they avoided politics at all costs, he said, to one where younger consumers want to know that their \u201cvalues are aligned.\u201d\u201cThis is something consumers and future consumers care about,\u201d he said, \u201cbut then again, there are very real business repercussions for expressing those points of view.\u201dBecause the public is so divided, any criticism of a brand tends to produce its own backlash. That dynamic is often visible on companies\u2019 Facebook pages, which can turn into unlikely battlegrounds for political posturing.That was apparent on Jim Beam\u2019s Facebook page after Ms. Kunis appeared on \u201cConan.\u201d She said on the show that her donations to Planned Parenthood in Mr. Pence\u2019s name were \u201ca reminder that there are women out there in the world that may or may not agree with his platform.\u201dJim Beam has declined to comment on its partnership with Ms. Kunis.Mike Proulx, chief digital officer of the ad agency Hill Holliday, said that companies have faced boycott threats for \u201cas long as brands have existed.\u201d While social media now enables consumers \u201cto express their thoughts and opinions instantly, openly and publicly,\u201d that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the amount of conflict is unprecedented, he said.\u201cThe question back to all of us is \u2014 is it that different from what was happening in the \u201960s?\u201d Mr. Proulx said. \u201cOr other moments in history where tensions were very, very high?\u201dPapa John\u2019s found itself in unpleasant territory after John Schnatter, the chief executive, said on an earnings call that the N.F.L. hurt his company\u2019s sales by \u201cnot resolving the current debacle\u201d with players who refuse to stand for the national anthem. That resulted in a wave of criticism, given that the gesture is a protest against racial injustice. The comments also prompted skepticism, since other advertisers said they had not been adversely affected.The situation escalated when a white supremacist website decided to endorse Papa John\u2019s for the comments \u2014 similar to the one that the shoe company New Balance found itself in a year ago, when a company official said that \u201cwe feel things are going to move in the right direction\u201d under Mr. Trump. Papa John\u2019s distanced itself from the group.Last week, the brand took to Twitter to clarify its position, reiterate its distaste for \u201cneo-Nazis\u201d and apologize to those who found the remarks about the N.F.L. to be \u201cdivisive.\u201d It added, \u201cWe believe in the right to protest inequality and support the players\u2019 movement to create a new platform for change. We also believe together, as Americans, we should honor our anthem. There is a way to do both.\u201dThese situations, said Norm Johnston, global chief digital officer for Mindshare, are a reminder that for companies today \u201cthere is nowhere to hide.\u201d\u201cIn an age where everything can be politicized,\u201d he said, \u201cit may be impossible for brands to not take a position on core values.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nine Women Accuse Israel Horovitz, Playwright and Mentor, of Sexual Misconduct", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJocelyn Meinhardt was 19 when she began a summer fellowship in 1989 with Mr. Horovitz at the Gloucester Stage Company in Massachusetts, where he was artistic director. She knew Mr. Horovitz; one of his sons, Adam Horovitz, who would go on to fame with the Beastie Boys, had been her high school boyfriend. That first night, she said, Mr. Horovitz drove her in his convertible \u2014 its license plate read AUTHOR \u2014 to the family home. He locked the door, then kissed and fondled her. She began to cry. Mr. Horovitz then led her to his bedroom, where she said he raped her.In 1991, when Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Giffard was 16 and an au pair for Mr. Horovitz, she said he groped her breasts and placed her hand on his erect penis. And last year, Maia Ermansons, then 21, said that when she met to discuss a theater project with Mr. Horovitz \u2014 whom she had known since she was a girl \u2014 he kissed her hard and cupped her breasts, remarking how \u201clarge and beautiful\u201d they had become. Stunned, she replied, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI felt close to him like a grandfather, but also he was a somewhat famous guy whose time I felt privileged to have,\u201d Ms. Ermansons said in an interview. \u201cFor the man who represented all that, to treat me the way he did, was the ultimate betrayal.\u201dIn response to questions this week, Mr. Horovitz, 78, told The New York Times that while he has \u201ca different memory of some of these events, I apologize with all my heart to any woman who has ever felt compromised by my actions, and to my family and friends who have put their trust in me. To hear that I have caused pain is profoundly upsetting, as is the idea that I might have crossed a line with anyone who considered me a mentor.\u201dHis son, Adam Horovitz, said in his own statement: \u201cI believe the allegations against my father are true, and I stand behind the women that made them.\u201dLast week, the theater cut ties with Mr. Horovitz after learning of the accusations by Ms. Ermansons.\u201cI apologize to the brave women who came forward in 1992 and 1993 but were not listened to,\u201d Elizabeth Neumeier, the Gloucester board\u2019s current president, said in a statement. \u201cWe are individually and collectively appalled by the allegations, both old and new.\u201dThe nine women who spoke with The Times described Mr. Horovitz as a complicated man who was, at times, a charismatic mentor and empathic friend. He taught at several universities and nurtured young writers, was generous with his wisdom and dazzled with tales of his famous friends. \u201cHe was very dynamic and a real creative force,\u201d said Ms. Corman, the actress.\u201cHe was a good mentor, until he was the worst, probably most nightmarish mentor you could have,\u201d Ms. Meinhardt said.The relationship was complex for Ms. Meinhardt. She said that after she was raped, she continued to work for Mr. Horovitz and went to extreme lengths to avoid being alone with him. But it was impossible: He was her boss. She said she and Mr. Horovitz had sex on two other occasions \u2014 consensual, she said, \u201cin that I didn\u2019t say no clearly.\u201d Like some of the other women, she stayed friendly with him for years.The nine women recounted experiences with Mr. Horovitz that had chilling similarities. Each woman\u2019s story was corroborated independently by people in whom they confided.Kathleen Nickels was the subscription manager of the Gloucester theater when she was 21, during the 1985-86 season. There, she said, Mr. Horovitz would corner her when she was in the office alone, kiss and fondle her, and once forced her hand down the front of his pants.Elizabeth Dann and Laura Crook were also in their 20s when they were an actress and an understudy in a 1990 Gloucester production of \u201cStrong-Man\u2019s Weak Child,\u201d which Mr. Horovitz wrote and directed. Along with Kim Senko, the technical director, the women created a \u201cbuddy system\u201d to avoid being alone with Mr. Horovitz, who they say harassed them repeatedly. Ms. Senko recounted how he pushed her against a wall in a dark hallway as she locked up the theater and shoved his hand down her pants as he pressed his mouth on hers.Jana Mestecky worked for Mr. Horovitz in her 20s between 1994 and 1996, first as an assistant and later a stage manager. She said that Mr. Horovitz would summon her to his house to drop off scripts \u2014 then answer the door naked. He kissed her, fondled her and groped her from behind as she worked, she said, often telling her she \u201cwouldn\u2019t get anywhere with such \u2018twisted Southern morals.\u2019\u201d (Ms. Mestecky grew up in Alabama.)\u201cI respect Israel immensely,\u201d Ms. Mestecky wrote in a journal entry dated February 1994. \u201cUnfortunately he has fallen, like Icarus, from his pedestal.\u201dMr. Horovitz called the claims in The Phoenix \u201ccharacter assassination.\u201d The board\u2019s then-president, Mr. Weiner, who is a lawyer, told The Phoenix that he had spoken to several female employees who had talked of unwelcome hugs and kisses by Mr. Horovitz \u2014 but that those descriptions did not fit the legal interpretation of sexual harassment. The women, he said, were \u201ctightly wound, if you know what I mean,\u201d adding that such accusations were tossed around \u201clike manhole covers.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Weiner characterized those 1993 comments as \u201cless-than-sensitive.\u201d He recently stepped down from an advisory panel at the Gloucester theater.Mr. Marx, the Phoenix writer, said the story \u201cjust seemed to fade away.\u201d\u201cThere were some people who just wrote this off as, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s just a little too kissy, a little too touchy, this is just show business,\u2019\u201d Mr. Marx said. \u201cNo, he was assaulting them.\u201dAll of the women interviewed by The Times processed their experiences differently. Ms. Meinhardt wrote a play based on it. Ms. Crook journaled. Ms. Giffard, the au pair (and now a lawyer in Paris) kept copies of the faxes Mr. Horovitz and his wife, Gillian Horovitz, had sent her mother, arranging her return to France. (In one, $92 was requested for the cost of a flight change.)In 2009, Ms. Meinhardt and Ms. Giffard separately confronted Mr. Horovitz about the abuse.\u201cI said, \u2018I was 16 and he was 52, and that the whole thing was completely wrong,\u2019\u201d Ms. Giffard said. \u201cHe said he hadn\u2019t realized that he had harmed me. He weakly apologized.\u201dBut then the Weinstein revelations began. One after the next, the women found themselves typing \u201cIsrael Horovitz\u201d into their computers. What they found was Ms. Ermansons, who had written her accusations about Mr. Horovitz on Facebook and Twitter.\u201cI felt frozen,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI said, \u2018I have a boyfriend,\u2019 and he said, \u2018I have a wife.\u2019 And then he sort of looked at me, and he was like, \u2018You know I\u2019m doing this for you, right? I\u2019m doing this because I love you Maia, do you know that I love you?\u2019 And it goes on and on. I didn\u2019t know if it was a threat or a proclamation.\u201dA few months later, Ms. Ermansons received a voice mail message from Mr. Horovitz, apologizing for the \u201cterrible, terrible misunderstanding.\u201d She saved it as an MP3.Soon the women began to find one another. They said they have drawn strength, even a measure of peace, by sharing their numbers.And yet there is an element of stolen ambition to it all. Ms. Meinhardt was a dramatic writing student at New York University at the time of the alleged assault. Afterward, she won her class\u2019s senior playwriting award and was the recipient of a prestigious scholarship. But she also struggled with depression and writer\u2019s block.The other women faced different versions of the same. Ms. Mestecky took a year off and moved home. Ms. Nickels left theater altogether. Ms. Dann veered from theater to more commercial work.\u201cI heard a word used recently about people like this \u2014 they\u2019re dream crushers,\u201d Ms. Dann said. \u201cHe took this thing that was such a beautiful thing, this young hope, this sense of promise, and he just ruined it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That is, the posts that you and I and anyone else can create and post to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Those are much more difficult to track, and we still don\u2019t know the extent to which Russia-linked organic content spread across all of these platforms.I wonder if this contrition will be enough to head off any strong regulation. I suspect it will.Apple gave some outlets \u2014 including TechCrunch, Buzzfeed and Backchannel, which is part of Wired \u2014 a week with the device. But many others, including The Times, were given just a day with the new phones. Meanwhile, Apple also offered review devices to several YouTube stars and some out-of-left-field choices, like the political journalist Mike Allen.That year, Apple provided early review units to big print outlets \u2014 the Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and Newsweek. In 2017, Apple has the pick of any outlet it wants; it knows that a review will get a lot of traffic on virtually any site, so it doesn\u2019t really matter whether it chooses an established media brand or some YouTuber with a fan base.Frankly, I agree! I don\u2019t really read traditional consumer reviews anymore, and I suspect the crowd for deep tech and gadgety reviews is growing smaller over time.Advertisement"}

Loeb, an outspoken charter school proponent and one of the biggest donors in New York politics, unfavorably compared a top African-American state senator to the Ku Klux Klan, he exchanged a separate series of caustic and racially charged emails with a top official in the de Blasio administration.\u201cThere is right and wrong and you put your bureaucracy, the union puppets you serve, over the interest of little vulnerable black children and their families,\u201d Mr. Loeb wrote in June 2017 to Richard Buery, the deputy mayor for strategic policy initiatives, in emails obtained by The New York Times under the state\u2019s Freedom of Information Act.Mr. Loeb later apologized and deleted that posting.Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, were among those who called on Mr. Loeb to resign as chairman of Success Academy. Others called for Democrats to return his campaign contributions. Mr. Loeb has been among the most generous donors to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, with Mr. Loeb and his wife giving the governor a combined $170,000. Mr. Cuomo declined to return the money.The email exchanges between Mr. Loeb and Mr. Buery, who has spent his career in public service, began in early 2014 and continued through the summer of 2017. They often start with Mr. Loeb sending Mr. Buery positive news clippings about Success Academy, the charter-school network he supports and serves as chairman, then by pointed and personal attacks.In August 2016, Mr. Loeb sent Mr. Buery a poll on the mayor\u2019s popularity and added, \u201cMaybe he should have trusted a proven educator to run pre-K instead of trying to score political points with the unions and hurting dozens of mostly black families in the process.\u201dMr. Buery replied, \u201cI hope you take this in the spirit of fellowship I intend, I cringe when you say we\u2019re \u2018hurting dozens of black families in the process.\u2019\u201dLater, in the same email chain, Mr. Loeb wrote there is an \u201castonishing lack of curiosity or support from anyone in the administration\u201d about the success of charter schools. He also wrote, \u201cI\u2019m with my family in Aspen enjoying a summer holiday, but the injustices I see and the bureaucracy \u2014 sometimes well intentioned, that perpetuates this \u2014 never leaves me, which is why I won\u2019t give up and won\u2019t forget.\u201dMr. Buery responded, \u201cHaving spent my entire life and career working for black and brown kids \u2014 literally every job I\u2019ve ever had since I was 16 \u2014 I can assure you that I understand the stakes.\u201dMr. Loeb, a billionaire hedge fund manager, is known in the business community for his aggressive and acidic letters to other companies he is targeting as an activist investor.The mayor\u2019s office declined to comment on the emails, but Mr. Loeb released a statement saying that his emails shared views that \u201care not about Deputy Mayor Buery specifically, but rather about the broad institutional failing by our government to confront a broken educational system with the urgency and focus it deserves.\u201d\u201cI have great respect for the deputy mayor,\u201d Mr. Loeb said in the statement, \u201cand I know we are aligned in our pursuit of better educational outcomes for New York City\u2019s children.\u201dThe most heated exchanges came in June, when Mr. Loeb wrote to Mr. Buery, \u201cI am happy you had and your children are getting a good education, but how you can do so little when poor black kids are failing out and boys disproportionately ending up in prison is really surprising.\u201d He went on to accuse Mr. Buery of being \u201cso smug and satisfied being a deputy mayor of a badly failing school system.\u201d\u201cGosh Dan,\u201d Mr. Buery wrote back less than 30 minutes later, \u201cyou don\u2019t know anything about my kid\u2019s school or how he got in.

That\u2019s a departure from the days when tech start-ups preferred old warehouses and office buildings converted into wide-open loft offices. Full of exposed brick, wooden beams, high ceilings and concrete floors, the funky work spaces gave birth to tech enclaves in places like San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood and Manhattan\u2019s Flatiron district.Tenants in the technology, creative and media industries leased more than 8.5 million square feet in trophy buildings in the United States over the 12 months that ended in the first quarter of 2017, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, the Chicago-based commercial real estate brokerage firm. That amounted to 22 percent of all trophy space leased over the period, a year-over-year increase of seven percentage points. It was also second only to the banking and finance sector in total square feet leased.Recent notable tech deals include Facebook\u2019s lease of 436,000 square feet in a new office and residential tower in downtown San Francisco, Spotify\u2019s lease of 378,000 square feet in 4 World Trade Center in Manhattan and HomeAway\u2019s lease of an entire 315,000-square-foot office building under construction in the Domain mixed-use neighborhood in Austin, Tex.But companies in all sectors today \u2014 not just tech \u2014 are demanding the design elements typically found in the warehouse conversions, such as open floor plans, natural light and exposed ceilings. Along with proximity to transit and amenities, layout is considered an important tool to recruit and retain workers, and developers are obliging tenants in new buildings and those in retrofitted older buildings, particularly modern offices built in the 1980s and later.\u201cIt turns out that we look really smart,\u201d said Mr. Daniels, whose early efforts to develop the Mark were halted by the Great Recession. \u201cBut it was kind of nerve-racking at the time.\u201dReal estate professionals say older buildings generally lack modern energy efficiencies, elevators, bathrooms and data capabilities. The inability to expand in the converted buildings and their scarcity are also restrictive.\u201cWe\u2019re creating an atmosphere of fun, fitness and food, because that\u2019s what tenants are looking for,\u201d Mr. Meghji said. \u201cThe role of landlords has evolved \u2014 today it\u2019s about providing an experience.\u201dMr. Daniels added a hotel and event space to the Mark when he resumed development after the recession. The additions appealed to F5 Networks, which ended up leasing 516,000 square feet of space. The changes helped round out the building\u2019s amenity package, which includes lounges, restaurants and a fitness facility.\u201cIt all brings a lot more life after 5,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \u201cThe younger set really likes to be entertained \u2014 at all times \u2014 whether it\u2019s by food, drink or games. They\u2019ve got to have it.\u201d\u201cSan Francisco certainly has morphed into more of a \u2018big tech\u2019 market, and the companies are all looking at new buildings,\u201d Mr. Sammons said. \u201cI think landlords are feeling much more confident in the market\u2019s long term than they were a couple of years ago, when many tech tenants were start-ups.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Lower Your Blood Pressure", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new guidelines have raised a number of questions for patients. Here are a few answers.Anyone with a 10 percent or greater risk of heart trouble \u2014 a stroke or heart attack \u2014 in the next decade. That works out to about half of all Americans, and 80 percent of those over age 65.How do I know my risk?Yes. Your reading probably will be higher if you have it taken right after you rush into the doctor\u2019s office instead of sitting quietly for five minutes or so. It will be higher if you ate or drank coffee or tea within the past half-hour.It will be higher in the daytime than at night. For some people, blood pressure will be higher if it is taken in the presence of a doctor.That\u2019s why the new guidelines say doctors should measure a patient\u2019s blood pressure two or more times and on two or more occasions. The average of those measurements will give the doctor some idea whether your blood pressure is too high.So what happens then?If blood pressure seems high in the doctor\u2019s office, then ideally you should measure it at home, in the morning and before dinner. Doctors also may provide patients with a device worn on the arm that measures pressure at periodic intervals over 24 hours.Be warned: Some people have so-called masked hypertension, including up to 30 percent of patients with chronic kidney disease. Their blood pressure may seem normal in the doctor\u2019s office, but later it rockets up to worrisome levels.\u201cNo one knows what to do about it,\u201d said Dr. Raymond Townsend, director of the hypertension clinic at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any information on the value of treating it but we know it is not good to have. These are the things that keep me up at night.\u201dAre there drugs or supplements that can raise blood pressure?Yes. They include alcohol (men should have no more than two drinks a day, and women no more than one), amphetamines, decongestants, herbal supplements like ephedra and St. John\u2019s wort, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin and ibuprofen and Celebrex. Steroids like prednisone can raise blood pressure, too.If I have high blood pressure, can I avoid taking drugs? Maybe. Individuals vary in how they respond to lifestyle changes alone. Among overweight people, blood pressure can drop by a point for every kilogram (2.2 pounds) of weight lost.For most people, a typical low-salt diet does not alter blood pressure very much. Reducing sodium might help if you can manage to get it to extremely low levels.\u201cThe jury is still out on the value of a very aggressive sodium reduction,\u201d Dr. Townsend said. \u201cIt is very hard to achieve, and the magnitude of the blood pressure effect depends a lot on whom you query.\u201dFinally: exercise. (You knew this was coming.) Aerobic exercise for 90 to 150 minutes a week can lead to a drop of 5 to 8 points in people with high blood pressure. But if patients stop the program, the benefit disappears.It pumps your blood throughout your body, but how much do you know about your heart? Learn about the most important steps you can take to keep it beating strong.I hate dieting and exercise. What about the drugs?There are five main first-line therapies. Most patients tolerate them well, and they often can be combined for an additive effect.* Diuretics reduce sodium levels in the blood and decrease blood volume. The most worrisome side effect is a sodium level that is too low. (Older, thin women are at the greatest risk.) Patients taking the more potent diuretic, chlorthalidone, should have regular lab tests to check sodium levels.* ACE inhibitors relax blood vessels. In about 10 percent of patients, the drugs cause a dry cough or high blood levels of potassium, which can be dangerous.* Angiotensin II receptor blockers, or ARBs, also relax blood vessels, but by a different mechanism. They, too, can lead to high potassium levels, detectable with blood tests. Patients taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs might want to talk to their doctors about whether a salt substitute is advisable, since many brands contain potassium.* Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers act on blood vessels, too, by still another mechanism. In some patients, the drugs can cause constipation, and in rare instances they can alter electrical conduction in the heart. If the effect is not picked up, the upper part of the heart can start to beat independently from the lower part.* Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers prevent blood vessel constriction, but in 5 to 10 percent of patients can cause constipation and mildly swollen hands and feet.What if drugs don\u2019t work?People with drug-resistant hypertension tend to fall into two categories, Dr. Townsend said. The first group: people who simply are not taking their drugs. That\u2019s as many as one in four patients.The second group, about 3 to 5 percent of people with high blood pressure, just does not respond to some medications or has such severe side effects that patients cannot tolerate them.If his patients are at high risk for heart disease \u2014 they are smokers or have diabetes, for example \u2014 Dr. Townsend often asks them to pick the blood pressure drug they dislike the least or to enroll in a clinical trial testing an experimental alternative.\u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything for these people, we know they will be in trouble,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pope Avoids Politics in Myanmar but Can\u2019t Quiet Questions on Rohingya", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cHe is not afraid of minefields,\u201d Mr. Burke said, bristling at the notion that the trip had damaged the moral authority that is the pope\u2019s most powerful diplomatic asset.\u201cPeople are not expected to solve impossible problems,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see him going ahead and you can criticize what is said and what is not said. But the pope is not going to lose moral authority on this question here.\u201dMyanmar presented the pope with a treacherous diplomatic tight wire. The world expected a global figure who has championed the downtrodden to speak out for the more than 600,000 Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh from Rakhine State in Myanmar to escape a military campaign of murder, rape and arson. But local bishops urged him to avoid addressing the issue out of concern that it could aggravate the problem and endanger the small Christian minority.In the news conference, Mr. Burke suggested that the pope had privately raised the issue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country\u2019s de facto leader and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose own reputation has sunk with the weight of the crisis.\u201cHe is a very free man,\u201d Mr. Burke said, when asked if the pope had brought it up.But the pope was not willing to publicly air the issue. As a result, his bishops and spokesman were, remarkably, left to play down his influence to bring about change and depict him as manipulated by the country\u2019s powerful interests.At the news conference, Bishop John Hsane Hgyi of Pathein, Myanmar, was asked whether the pope had requested that he and other prelates concern themselves with the crisis in western Rakhine State. \u201cIt might be a little bit beyond his authority,\u201d the bishop said, to do so.Bishop Hsane Hgyi went on to cast doubt on whether any ethnic cleansing was actually taking place: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it is true or not.\u201d (\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d said Khin Maung Myint, a self-described Rohingya Muslim who attended the news conference.)Mr. Burke suggested that the pope might be more at liberty to talk about the Rohingya when he meets with refugees in Bangladesh later this week, and argued that his silence did not take away from his previous championing \u2014 from the Vatican \u2014 of the Muslim minority as \u201cbrothers.\u201dIt was probably not the defensive note that the Vatican had hoped the Myanmar leg of the trip would end on.Earlier in the day, Francis rallied tens of thousands of Catholics of that tiny Christian population at an open-air Mass at Kyaikkasan Ground in Yangon, a faded colonial-era horse track where locals now play soccer and practice thaing, a local martial art.In his homily, Francis referred to the deep discrimination suffered by the country\u2019s many ethnic and religious groups.\u201cI know that many in Myanmar bear the wounds of violence, wounds both visible and invisible,\u201d the pope said, urging them to resist the temptation of revenge and seek \u201cforgiveness and compassion.\u201dThe closest mention of the Rakhine conflict was a prayer read by one of the faithful in the Karen language during the Mass.In the afternoon, the pope went to Yangon\u2019s Kaba Aye Pagoda, where he said he hoped Buddhist wisdom would help \u201cheal the wounds of conflict that through the years have divided people of different cultures, ethnicities and religious convictions.\u201dThe pope and his entourage of white-clad bishops and cardinals sat in stocking feet on ornately carved armchairs opposite the Most Venerable Bhaddanta Kumarabhivamsa, chairman of a state-run committee of senior monks, who was wrapped in brilliant red robes and flanked by other leading monks, wearing burgundy and saffron.Francis said the level of injustice, conflict and inequality was \u201cespecially pronounced\u201d in these times, and expressed admiration for those in Myanmar \u201cwho live in accord with the religious traditions of Buddhism,\u201d which he listed as \u201cthe values of patience, tolerance and respect for life.\u201dIn May, Buddhist vigilantes raided a Muslim neighborhood in Yangon where they believed Rohingya were hiding. Weeks later, the state-run committee that Francis met with on Wednesday banned organizations operating under the Patriotic Association of Myanmar, also known as Ma Ba Tha.On Wednesday, Bhaddanta Kumarabhivamsa, in prepared remarks made available by the Vatican, denounced the \u201cterrorism and extremism carried out in the name of religious beliefs,\u201d though it was not clear whether he was referring to Buddhism, Islam or both.He argued that the roots of extremism were not in religion itself, but \u201can evil interpretation of the original teachings of the respective religions.\u201dWhile he recognized Buddhism\u2019s special status in Myanmar, he also recognized the legitimate presence here of Hindus, Muslims and Christians.\u201cThis trip could be summed up in one word,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the word you are thinking about. It\u2019s unity.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to mob killings of Muslims in central Myanmar. They took place in 2013, not this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pizza for Breakfast, but Not What You Think", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteEating leftover pizza for breakfast is a time-honored tradition. Whether you prefer it cold and a little soggy, straight from the box, or heated in a skillet or broiler until the cheese bubbles, pizza is a near-perfect antidote to whatever kept you up way too late the night before in the first place.This breakfast pizza \u2014 topped with sharp pecorino, brawny bits of bacon and runny-yolk eggs \u2014 is nothing like that leftover takeout. That\u2019s not to say it is better, but it is certainly a different type of pizza experience, one worth getting out of bed a little early for.The bacon and eggs make it suitable for breakfast. Plus, instead of red sauce, this white pie is slathered with ricotta and mozzarella, so it is both extra rich and a little more coffee-friendly.Then it is just a matter of assembling ingredients and precooking the bacon.You can fry the bacon in a skillet, if you like, but I prefer baking it as the oven preheats. This is especially convenient if you have a pizza stone, since it needs at least 20 to 30 minutes to properly heat up. While the oven is on, you may as well throw in a pan of bacon to brown.Do not substitute fancy burrata for the mozzarella here. The cream stuffed into the burrata makes it too wet. Fresh regular mozzarella or buffalo mozzarella are ideally sweet and creamy, but even supermarket mozzarella gets the job done in a pinch. That\u2019s because the focus will be on the crisp chunks of bacon and runny egg yolk beside the gooey cheese.Keeping the yolks runny is the main challenge in making this dish. Under a strong broiler, they can go from perfect to firm in just a few seconds. Watch the pizza carefully, and pull it out a few seconds before the yolks are to your taste. The residual heat will finish cooking them.Serve your pizza for breakfast, brunch or a dinner. It is even fancy enough to offer guests \u2014 something best not attempted with takeout leftovers of any variety.cookingAdvertisement"}

No, but automobiles are actually a model for the public health approach I\u2019m suggesting.We don\u2019t ban cars, but we work hard to regulate them \u2013 and limit access to them \u2013 so as to reduce the death toll they cause. This has been spectacularly successful, reducing the death rate per 100 million miles driven by 95 percent since 1921.Take a look at the history of motor vehicle safety since World War II:Deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled19469.3581968  First federal safety standards for cars64201621.18\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910sDeaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled19469.35First seatbelt offered in an American carFirst federal safety standards for cars81974  55 m.p.h. national speed limit1993  Car safety ratings introduced61978  Tennessee is first to require child safety seats1999  Airbags, invented in 1951, become mandatory1984  4New York is first to require seat belt use2000  Mandatory reporting of defects by carmakers201621.18\u201946\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s2000s\u201910s\u201916Frankly, liberal opposition to guns has often been ineffective, and sometimes counterproductive. The 10-year ban on assault weapons accomplished little, partly because definitions were about cosmetic features like bayonet mounts (and partly because even before the ban, such guns were used in only 2 percent of crimes).The left sometimes focuses on \u201cgun control,\u201d which scares off gun owners and leads to more gun sales. A better framing is \u201cgun safety\u201d or \u201creducing gun violence,\u201d and using auto safety as a model\u2014constant efforts to make the products safer and to limit access by people who are most likely to misuse them.What would a public health approach look like for guns if it were modeled after cars? It would include:If someone steals my iPhone, it\u2019s useless, and the same should be true of guns. Gun manufacturers made child-proof guns back in the 19th century (before dropping them), and it\u2019s time to advance that technology today. Some combination of smart guns and safe storage would also reduce the number of firearms stolen in the U.S. each year, now about 200,000, and available to criminals.We also need to figure out whether gun buybacks, often conducted by police departments, are cost-effective and help reduce violence. And we can experiment more with anti-gang initiatives, such as Cure Violence, that have a good record in reducing shootings.Estimated Percent of Households WithGuns, by StateHawaiiMass.U.S. AVERAGE: 32% OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE GUNS R.I.N.J.N.Y.Del.Conn.Ill.Calif.Fla.Md.Wash.N.H.Ind.OhioCo.Pa.IowaMinn.Ariz.Nev.N.D.Mich.Va.Ore.N.M.N.C.Tex.S.C.Neb.Kan.Ga.Mo.Okla.Wisc.La.Ky.UtahAla.MaineTenn.S.D.W.

The Las Vegas carnage, for example, might not have been prevented by any of the suggestions I make.That\u2019s true, and there\u2019s no magic wand available. Yet remember that although it is mass shootings that get our attention, they are not the main cause of loss of life. Much more typical is a friend who shoots another, a husband who kills his wife \u2013 or, most common of all, a man who kills himself. Skeptics will say that if people want to kill themselves, there\u2019s nothing we can do. In fact, it turns out that if you make suicide a bit more difficult, suicide rates drop.Here are the figures showing that mass shootings are a modest share of the total, and the same is true of self-defense \u2013 despite what the N.R.A. might have you believe.OTHER CAUSESDEATHS INMASSSHOOTINGS:456VICTIMS KILLINGPERPETRATORS INSELF-DEFENSE:589SHARE OF ALLGUN DEATHS:OTHER CAUSESVICTIMS KILLINGPERPETRATORS INSELF-DEFENSE:589DEATHS INMASSSHOOTINGS:456SHARE OF ALLGUN DEATHS:For skeptics who think that gun laws don\u2019t make a difference, consider what happened in two states, Missouri and Connecticut. In 1995, Connecticut tightened licensing laws, while in 2007 Missouri  eased gun laws.The upshot? After tightening gun laws, firearm homicide rates dropped 40 percent in Connecticut. And after Missouri eased gun laws, gun homicide rates rose 25 percent.Connecticut after 1995 lawtightening licensing requirementsEstimated change in\u201340%Estimated change in\u201315%Missouri after 2007 repealof license requirementsEstimated change in+25%Estimated change in+16%Connecticut after 1995 lawtightening licensing requirementsMissouri after 2007 repealof license requirementsEstimated change inrate of gun homicide\u201340%+25%Estimated change inrate of gun suicide\u201315%+16%One of the lessons of gun research is that we often focus just on firearms themselves, when it may be more productive to focus on who gets access to them. A car or gun is usually safe in the hands of a 45-year-old woman with no criminal record, but may be dangerous when used by a 19-year-old felon with a history of alcohol offenses or domestic violence protection orders.Yet our laws have often focused more on weapons themselves (such as the assault weapons ban) rather than on access. In many places, there is more rigorous screening of people who want to adopt dogs than of people who want to purchase firearms.In these two states, the laws affected access, and although there\u2019s some indication that other factors were also involved in Connecticut (and correlations don\u2019t prove causation), the outcomes are worth pondering.There\u2019s simply a scandalous lack of research on gun violence, largely because the N.R.A. is extremely hostile to such research and Congress rolls over. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did try to research gun violence, Congress responded by cutting its funding.Here is the American toll from four diseases and firearms over the years 1973-2012 \u2013 and the number of National Institutes of Health research grants to explore each problem over that same time.N.I.H. research awardsDiseaseNumber of casesRabies6556Polio266212Cholera400129Diphtheria1,33789Firearmsinjuries3>4 millionNumberof casesDiseaseN.I.H. research awardsRabies6589Polio266129Cholera400212Diphtheria1,33756Firearm Injuries3>4 millionOne approach that could reduce the abuse of guns is better training. As a 13-year-old farm boy in Oregon, I attended a N.R.A. gun safety class (which came with a one-year membership to the N.R.A., making me an N.R.A. alum who despises what that organization has become). These classes can be very useful, and audits found that more than 80 percent cover such matters as checking the gun to see if it\u2019s loaded, keeping one\u2019s finger off the trigger until ready to fire and being certain of the target.Yet the audits also suggest that trainers are more likely to advocate for the N.R.A. or for carrying guns than for, say, safe storage. This is a missed opportunity, for all classes should cover the risks of guns and alcohol, the risks of abuse with suicide and domestic violence, the need for safe storage, and so on. Here\u2019s what researchers found that the gun classes they audited actually covered:NOTDISCUSSEDPERCENT OF CLASSESWHERE DISCUSSEDTrainers encouragedgun carrying81%19Encouragedgun ownership7624Prevent unsupervisedaccess by children7030Encouraged gun usefor self-defense69316040Ricochet6040Theft preventionEncouraged membershipin gun-rights group5644Legal ramifications ofshooting in self-defense55455347Child access lawsRecommendation: whennot in use, store unloaded5050Recommendation: usegun only as last resort4555Young childrenand gun accidents55457030Decision-making in crisesTheft is important sourceof firearms used in crime8020Techniques forde-escalating threats8515Recommendation:report stolen firearms9010Watch for signs of suicidein household members90109010Domestic violence riskTopic discussedPercent of classes where discussedNot discussedTrainers encouraged gun carrying1981%Encouraged gun ownership2476Prevent unsupervised access by children3070Encouraged gun use for self-defense3169Ricochet4060Theft prevention4060Encouraged membership in gun-rights group4456Legal ramifications of shooting in self-defense4555Child access laws4753Recommendation: when not in use, store unloaded5050Recommendation: use gun only as last resort5545Young children and gun accidents5545Decision-making in crises7030Theft is an important source of firearms used in crime8020Techniques for de-escalating threats8515Recommendation: report stolen firearms9010Watch for signs of suicide in household members9010Domestic violence risk9010It may sometimes seem hopeless to make progress on gun violence, especially with the N.R.A. seemingly holding Congress hostage. But I\u2019m more optimistic.Look, we all agree on some kinds of curbs on guns. Nobody believes that people should be able to drive a tank down Main Street, or have an anti-aircraft gun in the backyard. I\u2019ve been to parts of northern Yemen where one could actually buy a tank or an anti-aircraft gun, as well as fully automatic weapons \u2014 and that area\u2019s now embroiled in a civil war \u2013 but fortunately in America we have agreed to ban those kinds of weaponry.So the question isn\u2019t whether we will restrict firearms, but where to draw the line and precisely which ones to restrict.Check out these polling numbers as a basis for action on gun safety:Agree with the following:Householdswith no gunsGun households50%Background checksfor all gun buyers93%96%Preventing mentally ill from buying guns8989Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes8885Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists8284Background checks for private sales and at gun shows7787Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases7289Ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun6779A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence6175New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns5771Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence5681Creating a federal database to track gun sales5480A ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines(10+ bullets)*5277Householdswith no gunsGun householdsAgree with the following:50%93%Background checks for all gun buyers96%89Preventing the mentally ill from buying guns89Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes8885Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists8284Background checks for private sales and at gun shows7787Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases7289A ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun6779A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence6175New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns5771Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence5681Creating a federal database to track gun sales5480A ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines (10+ bullets)*5277Looking ahead, I\u2019m optimistic that there can be progress at the state level, and some of the necessary research funding will come from private foundations. Maybe some police departments will put in orders for smart guns to help create a market.But the real impetus for change will come because the public favors it. In particular, note that 93 percent of people even in gun households favor universal background checks for gun purchases.If you\u2019re wondering how we managed to crank out all these charts and data in the immediate aftermath of the Texas shooting, here\u2019s the secret: We didn\u2019t. We spent weeks gathering the information and preparing the charts, because we knew that there would be a tragedy like this one to make it all relevant.That\u2019s the blunt, damning truth: Friday\u2019s school shooting was 100 percent predictable. After each such incident, we mourn the deaths and sympathize with the victims, but we do nothing fundamental to reduce our vulnerability.Some of you will protest, as President Trump did, that it\u2019s too soon to talk about guns, or that it is disrespectful to the dead to use such a tragedy to score political points. Yet more Americans have died from gun violence, including suicides, since 1970 (about 1.4 million) than in all the wars in American history going back to the Revolutionary War (about 1.3 million). And it\u2019s not just gang-members: In a typical year, more pre-schoolers are shot dead in America (about 75) than police officers are.Yes, making America safer will be hard: There are no perfect solutions. The Second Amendment is one constraint, and so is our polarized political system and the power of the gun lobby. It\u2019s unclear how effective some of my suggestions will be, and in any case this will be a long, uncertain, uphill process.But automobiles are a reminder that we can chip away at a large problem through a public health approach: Just as auto safety improvements have left us far better off, it seems plausible to some gun policy experts that a sensible, politically feasible set of public health steps could over time reduce firearm deaths in America by one-third \u2013 or more than 10,000 lives saved each year.So let\u2019s not just shed tears for the dead, give somber speeches and lower flags. Let\u2019s get started and save lives.Advertisement"}

The new wave of artificial intelligence will reduce jobs, but will also improve your health and products like your smartphone. Here are five areas where tech companies, large and small, will change the way we live.Such technology will improve health care in places where doctors are scarce. But eventually, it will streamline care in the developed world as well. Google is already running tests inside two hospitals in India, and the start-up Infervision has deployed similar technology in hospitals across China.In the longer term, similar methods promise to rapidly accelerate drug discovery and so many other aspects of health care. \u201cEverything from the nature of the food that we grow and eat to the drugs that we give ourselves to how we monitor the impact of these things is all being transformed by A.I. in deeply profound ways,\u201d said Matt Ocko, a managing partner at DCVC, a San Francisco venture capital firm that has invested heavily in this area.Neural networks are not limited to image recognition. Far from it. These same techniques are rapidly improving coffee-table gadgets like the Amazon Echo, which can recognize spoken commands from across the room, and online services like Skype, which can instantly translate phone calls from one language to another. They may even eventually produce machines that can carry on a conversation.Recently, said Luke Zettlemoyer, a University of Washington professor, there has been a \u201chuge phase shift\u201d in the area of natural language understanding \u2014 technology that understands the natural way people talk and write. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are at the forefront of this movement, which promises to fundamentally change how we interact with phones, cars, and potentially any machine. Many companies are moving down the same path, including Replika, a San Francisco start-up.With help from machine learning, Replika offers a smartphone \u201cchatbot\u201d that acts as a kind of personal confidante, chatting with you in moments when no one else is around. But the hope is that these techniques will improve to where they serve you in so many other ways. What if Alexa was truly conversational, if you could have a back and forth dialogue? Right now, it is about basic questions and commands. Today, it \u201crecognizes\u201d words very very well. But truly \u201cunderstanding\u201d complex English sentences is beyond machines at this point. What if machines could carry on a dialogue like Hal in 2001?Using electroencephalography, or EEG \u2014 a longstanding means of measuring electrical brain activity from sensors placed on the head \u2014 the start-up Neurable is building a virtual reality game that can be played with the mind. EEG is limited for this kind of use, but other researchers, including at Facebook, aim to build a far more powerful systems using optical sensors. Facebook hopes that, in a few years, this technology will let people type with their minds five times faster than they can with a smartphone keyboard.These techniques will also face physical limits, and that may bar the way to Facebook\u2019s goal. But various start-ups, including Neuralink, founded by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, are going several steps further, hoping to read brain activity from chips implanted inside the skull. At first, they will limit this technology to people with disabilities. But ultimately, Mr. Musk and others hope to also implant chips in healthy people.\u201cIt is implausible that this technology would go straight into healthy people,\u201d said Ed Boyden, an M.I.T. neuroscientist who is also an adviser to Neuralink. \u201cBut there is a natural trajectory where, if a medical technology proves effective, it can move into normal individuals as well.\u201dWant more science fiction in your everyday reality? As entrepreneurs like Mr. Musk work to put a chip in your head, others are working to put cars in the skies.At first, Kitty Hawk will sell its vehicles to hobbyists. But the company hopes it can eventually convince the general public, and regulators, that flying cars make sense. That is no easy task. After all, these cars will require a new kind of air traffic control.Even more outlandish? It\u2019s the prospect of a quantum computer. Drawing on the seemingly magical properties of quantum physics, such a machine would be exponentially more powerful than computers of today. Think of it this way: A quantum computer could instantly crack the encryption that protects the world\u2019s most private data.The problem is that these machines are enormously difficult to build. but progress has accelerated. Google, IBM and Intel are investing heavily in this push, as are start-ups like Rigetti Computing.Researchers say they believe that quantum machines eventually could accelerate drug discovery, streamline financial markets, solve traffic problems and more.\u201cIt is a completely different paradigm for processing information,\u201d said Robert Schoelkopf, who helped invent the techniques that are driving so much of quantum computing research. \u201cSo we think that known applications are just the tip of the iceberg.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But at the same time, anyone can be irresponsible and malicious.\u201dHe noted that Facebook and Twitter see themselves as neutral platforms that cannot take a side in disputes. So the aggrieved call lawyers. \u201cWe get inquiries daily: \u2018I\u2019ve been defamed online. What can you do to help?\u2019\u201d Mr. Clark said.Ms. Kohler, who runs a scuba diving company in Hawaii with her husband, had both narrow and far-reaching goals when she wrote her Facebook post on Oct. 18.She wanted to unburden herself of something horrible that she said had happened to her, something that she had never told a single soul before that morning. Describing a drunken night about a decade ago, she wrote about Brett Ratner, a Hollywood producer and director.\u201cBrett Ratner raped me,\u201d Ms. Kohler wrote on Facebook. \u201cI\u2019m saying his name, I\u2019m saying it publicly.\u201dBut such is the nature of Facebook that others quickly read it as well, including an associate of Mr. Ratner\u2019s. His attorney, Martin Singer, called before lunch. \u201cI was totally caught off guard,\u201d Ms. Kohler said.Accounts of what happened next differ. Mr. Singer said that he had spoken to Ms. Kohler \u201cin a cordial, nonthreatening tone\u201d and that she had agreed that the post was fabricated. Ms. Kohler denied saying that, but said she had been so intimidated by the lawyer that she removed the post.That, Mr. Ratner concluded, was not enough.\u201cI\u2019m in a world I never thought I\u2019d be in,\u201d Ms. Kohler, 39, said. \u201cIf he wins, I don\u2019t know what he thinks he\u2019s going to get from me.\u201dShe has high-powered help. Her attorney, Roberta Kaplan, is best known for representing Edith Windsor in the landmark 2013 Supreme Court case that forced the government to recognize same-sex marriages.Ms. Kohler wrote in the Facebook post that the incident happened in 2004 or 2005, but now says it happened a few years later. At the time, she was doing marketing for a now-defunct start-up energy drink in Los Angeles. She said she had met Mr. Ratner at a club and had gone with him to his friend\u2019s house.\u201cHe forced himself on me after I said no and no and no again,\u201d she wrote in the Facebook post, which was reviewed by The New York Times.\u201cThere were only two people there, Brett Ratner and Melanie,\u201d Ms. Kaplan said. \u201cNo other witnesses. One is telling the truth, and one is not. So the question is, why is Melanie going to come out with it now, other than with the goal she has \u2014 to help other women, and to make sure Brett Ratner or anyone else is unable to do this again?\u201dMr. Ratner\u2019s suit may not only be the first; it might also be something of a test case for the whole concept of pushing back in court. To the extent the suit draws attention to accusations that might have gotten little publicity without corroboration, it may backfire on the director and set a precedent that others are reluctant to emulate.Mr. Singer explained in an interview last week, before the suit was filed, how he policed the internet on behalf of Hollywood stars.\u201cI have hundreds of high-profile clients,\u201d he said. He did not name any, but they include Arnold Schwarzenegger, John Travolta, Charlie Sheen and, for a time, Bill Cosby.\u201cPeople write bad things about them all the time on social media,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cYou have to figure out when to deal with it and when not to deal with it.\u201dTwo-thirds or three-quarters of the time, he said, he asks someone to take something down and they don\u2019t. \u201cI reach out, they give me the finger\u201d he said, and \u201csay, \u2018I\u2019m not doing anything.\u2019\u201d\u201cThey make it a bigger story,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe write websites a letter, and then they post that letter,\u201d as a sort of thumbing of the nose.It\u2019s impossible to tell how many cease-and-desist or so-called demand letters are being issued now, although noses are being thumbed as readily as ever.When Mr. Singer was interviewed, little had been published about Mr. Ratner, who is probably best known for the \u201cRush Hour\u201d buddy cop movies. But Twitter was bubbling with anonymous secondhand allegations of unsavory behavior.Mr. Singer dismissed such posts as beneath his attention. \u201cAnonymous postings, that\u2019s a problem forever. People hide themselves all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nut cases out there.\u201dThat\u2019s the fear among actors who said they had done nothing wrong but had gotten on the wrong side of a few of their fans. One actor, who was criticized on Twitter by an anonymous account for being overfriendly with female fans, responded with a tweet about bringing in lawyers. He now regrets drawing any attention.\u201c\u2018I didn\u2019t do it\u2019 is the exact same answer an innocent person would give as well as a guilty person,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cNobody has time for a judge or a jury, just an accuser and an executioner.\u201d He asked to remain anonymous because, he said, it would end his career if he publicly spoke up.\u201cWe were dealing with this back in the MySpace days\u201d more than a decade ago, he said. But he added: \u201cDo I think people may be more emboldened? Yes, they may.\u201dOther lawyers said that, at least for the moment, the landscape had changed significantly.\u201cThere is less fear in making these assertions in various arenas, whether it\u2019s through traditional media, social media or privately,\u201d said Miles Feldman of the Los Angeles law firm Raines Feldman, which handles dozens of online defamation cases a year. \u201cAs a result, we\u2019re seeing a serious uptick in inquiries and requests for action.\u201dBut that is true of the victims as well, suggesting that all sorts of lawyers will be busy in the years to come.Debra Katz, a Washington-based specialist in harassment and employment discrimination, acknowledged the appeal of taking complaints online.\u201cIt\u2019s a sweeter form of justice to out someone as a sexual harasser in a Facebook post than go through a lengthy, painful and expensive trial,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Paul Ryan\u2019s Middle-Class Tax Hike", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first, people talked about the Republicans\u2019 plan for tax reform. Once most of the plan\u2019s reform elements disappeared, a more appropriate name seemed to be \u201ctax cut.\u201d But now that the bill\u2019s details are coming out, it\u2019s time to update the name again. Here\u2019s my suggestion:Paul Ryan\u2019s 2017 Tax Increase on Middle-Class Families.It was one of two damaging evaluations of the bill that came out yesterday; the other came from the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress. The budget office projected that the plan would increase the deficit by $1.7 trillion over the next decade, even more than Republican leaders had claimed.Ultimately, Congress will need to find a way to pay those costs, and the most likely strategy will involve tax increases or benefit cuts for the middle class and poor. Put it all together, and this bill is a middle-class tax increase.In effect, Ryan and other House leaders are proposing an enormous tax cut for the wealthy and then trying to hold down the bill\u2019s cost by raising taxes on middle-class and poor families. On average, households making at least $5 million would receive an annual tax cut of almost $300,000 once the bill was fully phased in.The situation for the middle class is quite different.The attached chart breaks down the estimated changes for families with children, by income level.(I left out the top income groups from the chart, because their tax cuts are so large that every other bar in the chart becomes difficult to read.)I expect Republicans to scramble in coming days to make the bill less bad for the middle class. Senate Republicans are reportedly meeting to talk about taxes this morning and may release their own bill shortly thereafter. But tweaks aren\u2019t enough. Anything less than an entirely new tax plan from the Senate isn\u2019t worth passing.I mean, does the Paul Ryan Middle-Class Tax Increase sound as if it\u2019s a good idea?\u201cThe results Tuesday are fully consistent with a so-called wave election, like the ones that brought Democrats to power in the House in 2006 and back out in 2010,\u201d Cohn writes. \u201cThe catch, though, is that the overwhelming Democratic strength in well-educated areas did not cross the political divides of the 2016 election and reach into white working-class areas.\u201dWithout more white support, the Democrats may not be able to win the House next year, he concludes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This May Be the Best Beef at Any Korean BBQ in New York", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant ReviewWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.After taking cocktail orders (the ros\u00e9 slushie, decorated with a paper flamingo, tastes the way wine does when you are 8 years old), servers will offer a tour of the menu that ends with a strong endorsement of the \u201cbutcher\u2019s feast.\u201d This is a set menu, at $45 a person, with fluffy steamed eggs in a pot, two fundamental Korean stews, pickles, lettuce and, at the center of it all, a dealer\u2019s choice of four cuts of beef. After all that has been cleared, vanilla soft serve under a squiggle of soy caramel appears in little paper cups with little wooden spoons.The meats at my most recent butcher\u2019s feast were hanger steak, the reddish-purple of a brand-new bruise; a rib-eye together with a flap of rib-eye cap, both pink and spiderwebbed with white veins of fat; a thickish slab of flatiron steak, said to be the product of a cow who had Wagyu on one side of the family and Angus on the other; and finally galbi, short ribs in a sweet soy marinade. The other cuts in the butcher\u2019s feast vary but galbi is a constant, as it should be.13 PhotosThe meats came out early, while the gas grill warmed up. The wire cage over it was primed with a cube of beef fat, and then the beef went on, one cut at a time. Our server turned the meat once, then walked away, and one of my guests started to worry that the meat would burn. But the flames were low, and the beef browned gradually.One night I ignored the butcher\u2019s feast path and went off-road so I could try some sirloin that had been ripening downstairs for 138 days. Steaks aged that long are often described as funky, but the word doesn\u2019t cover this piece of meat. It tasted like something other than beef, or maybe beyond beef, more condiment than protein. At $80 for six ounces, it was not my cup of barley tea, but it may be yours.Next time, I\u2019ll stick to the road more traveled by. The butcher\u2019s feast takes in most of the menu\u2019s highlights, avoids the lowlights, and does so at a very good price for a steak supper.No matter what or how you order, though, you will have to contend with Cote\u2019s notions of when to serve the condiments and side dishes that make the difference between Korean barbecue and a heap of grilled meat. Pickled cauliflower and soy-marinated chayote (both very good), lettuce and ssamjang (the fermented bean paste) arrive as the beef starts cooking. Rice doesn\u2019t turn up until midway through the meal, when you\u2019re finally brought pickled daikon, kimchi, kimchi stew and fermented bean-paste stew. Gochujang may show up at the beginning or at halftime.There is no one right way to eat Korean barbecue, but people who like to bundle the meat into lettuce or shiso with a lump of rice and a pickled cabbage leaf will wonder why Cote parcels the side dishes out in stages.That isn\u2019t the only case of the missing kimchi. I couldn\u2019t taste it in the fried rice \u201cpaella\u201d with kimchi and Wagyu. The dish didn\u2019t have much in common with paella, either. I wouldn\u2019t care what it was called if it were delicious, but like some of the other attempts to loosen Korean custom, it came off as timid.More traditional Korean dishes tended to taste more complete. If you want more starch than rice alone, the skinny wheat noodles in hot anchovy broth are simple and delicious. Cold noodles stirred at the table with slivered apples, lettuce and gochujang are spicy, sweet and refreshing. There\u2019s a very good dolsot bibimbap, with a chewy bottom crust where the rice meets the searingly hot bowl.Aside from the meat locker, the other useful idea Cote borrowed from steakhouses is a wine list that is chosen with beef in mind and can run into real money if you\u2019re not careful. Anyone hoping to find a red for less than $100 will find that a quick glance at, say, California or the C\u00f4te d\u2019Or can be discouraging. But Victoria James, who wrote the list, found some pockets of affordability in Beaujolais, Southern France, Corsica and Switzerland, and she makes a small adventure out of the wines by the glass, all poured from magnums.Does Brouilly go with ssamjang? Can a Patrimonio get along with galbi? I didn\u2019t know I wanted answers to these questions before Cote came along, but now I do.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}

And, please, no pineapple.\u201d\u2014 Joanne Jahr, Upper East Side\u201cThe one glaring problem with a Chicago pizza slice is not so much the taste, but that it is so thick that you cannot fold it. How in the world can you walk with a Coke in one hand and a slice in the other and eat it unless it is folded? Eating an unfolded slice is like eating a floor tile.\u201d\u201cNew York pizza is ephemeral. Chicago pizza is interminable. Balance in the pizza-verse can only be achieved by the existence of both.\u201d\u2014 Bradley Parker, 39, HarlemIs there more to New York pizza than the taste?\u201cIt\u2019s one of the ultimate grab-and-go foods. It can be prepared quickly, served in seconds, eaten on the spot, or given the \u2018Flatbush fold\u2019 and enjoyed on the move.\u201d\u201dIt\u2019s always cheap, thin, greasy, and just hits the spot!\u201dPam Steele Tabbaa, 68, Ann Arbor, Mich.\u201cI would take a New York City slice, served piping hot out of the oven onto a generic white paper plate as I walk around the city, over any other slice anywhere in the world. It\u2019s not just the pizza, it\u2019s the spirit of the city embedded in it that makes all the difference. We all have our preferences. And for me, New York is the place for pizza, and for life.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Sorry, amore, it\u2019s wet.Slippery stairs and misty hair are in the forecast as rain could fall throughout the morning commute.But not everyone likes the new name.Monroe Mann, 40, a lawyer from Port Chester, N.Y., told us he started the petition because he was upset that the new name would overlook the region\u2019s Native American and Dutch traditions. (The bridge is named for a Native American tribe and the Dutch word for \u201csea.\u201d)But just because a bridge or tunnel carries the name of a politician, doesn\u2019t mean it will stick for New Yorkers.For example, when was the last time you said you were taking the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel? (The official name of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel). Or told your roommate you biked across the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge? Or asked a cabdriver to take the Joe DiMaggio Highway, better known as the West Side Highway?Even the Tappan Zee Bridge had another name: It was officially renamed the Gov. Malcolm Wilson Tappan Zee Bridge in 1994. In a twist of fate, the bill to change the name back then was championed by Mario M. Cuomo, who argued that Mr. Wilson never received the recognition he deserved.What do you think about naming the bridge after Mario M. Cuomo? Let us know in the comments.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Curious Path to Legalizing Gay Marriage", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe survey drew a huge response, and the margin of victory sent a clear message about where Australians stand. But the costs of the mail-in survey \u2014 both financial and psychological \u2014 have been staggering.So even as the \u201cyes\u201d side celebrates, many Australians are frustrated. Their country, they believe, could have gotten to this point faster if lawmakers and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had simply done their jobs and passed a bill reflecting what previous polls showed most Australians wanted.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like it says that we\u2019re ahead of any sort of pack on this issue, but ultimately the popular will has overridden the cynical use of a system \u2014 and that\u2019s heartening,\u201d said Peter Lewis, one of Australia\u2019s most respected pollsters for progressive causes. \u201cIt shows the people are way ahead of the current government.\u201dMany gay couples argue that passage of a bill is already overdue.Still, he and many others were quick to say that Australia should view the results with pride. Australians overwhelmingly supported same-sex marriage, with 61.6 percent voting \u201cyes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s proven that Australians want a \u2018fair go\u2019 for everyone,\u201d said Chris Lewis, 60, an artist who watched the results in Prince Alfred Park in Sydney with his partner and hundreds of others. \u201cIt\u2019s vindication.\u201dParticipation in the survey was higher than initially expected. It beat participation in the referendum in Britain on leaving the European Union (72.2 percent) and far surpassed the percentage of Americans who voted in the 2016 presidential election (58 percent). The youngest eligible voters, 18 and 19 years old, were especially eager, with 78.2 percent returning their mail-in ballots, more than for any other age group below 45.\u201cThe fact that 80 percent of the population \u2014 including a large cohort who had probably never sent a letter in their lives \u2014 were prepared to do it shows that we are engaged,\u201d Mr. Lewis said.Australia has turned social issues directly over to the people before. On May 27, 1967, 91 percent of Australian voters agreed by referendum to delete two discriminatory references to Aborigines in Australia\u2019s Constitution.Like the same-sex marriage vote, the 1967 vote was highly symbolic.It is often celebrated (incorrectly) as the referendum that gave Australia\u2019s Indigenous population the vote, but that had been approved in 1962. What it really did was lay the groundwork for the process \u2014 still unfinished \u2014 of achieving racial equality. It cemented, in law, a broader idea of Australian identity.But for many Aboriginal Australians, the referendum process \u2014 being forced to ask the more powerful white majority for inclusion \u2014 was also humiliating and painful.\u201cI can only imagine the courage it took for my Aboriginal grandparents to campaign in 1967 to be counted as human beings in Australia,\u201d said Deborah Cheetham, an Aboriginal Australian soprano, actor, composer and playwright who is also gay and was a vocal \u201cyes\u201d supporter. \u201cHow demoralizing.\u201dWhat made the same-sex marriage vote even more controversial was that it had nothing to do with the Australian Constitution, and could have been avoided.If public engagement in the vote showed the health of Australia\u2019s democracy, the survey itself points to its opposite: a dysfunctional, out-of-touch legislature that often lags behind the world and its own constituents on many of the most important issues of the day.In Prince Alfred Park, among the celebrants, this was the view arising quickly and at increased volume after the first expression of pride.\u201cA minority group should never have to go through this,\u201d said Annika Lowry, 42, a heterosexual \u201cyes\u201d voter pushing her 4-year-old daughter in a stroller. \u201cIt\u2019s un-Australian. It\u2019s cruel.\u201dShe was referring to a \u201cno\u201d campaign that fought a no-limits losing battle.The \u201cyes\u201d campaign could focus on mobilization; opinion polls had already shown that most Australians supported the cause. The \u201cno\u201d side faced a different challenge: getting people who might be complacent or undecided to agree with their position and care enough to send back the survey.Some \u201cno\u201d voters said that while they did not necessarily endorse all of what was said, they were glad to have a chance to confront the other side.\u201cIt\u2019s a big negotiation and debate over truth,\u201d said Rob Assaf, 21, a university student in Sydney who voted \u201cno.\u201d \u201cI love that. I thrive off it.\u201dGay couples (among others) were horrified during the campaign, and still are.Paulo Corte-Real, an activist who has become a global expert on same-sex marriage after working to legalize it in Portugal in 2009, said \u201ca referendum on same-sex marriage inevitably brings homophobia to the public discourse, creating a greater strain on people whose rights are already being publicly challenged.\u201dSome voters said they were especially disappointed in Mr. Turnbull. The head of Australia\u2019s center-right Liberal party, he supports same-sex marriage, but his handling of the issue has contributed to a widening frustration with his leadership, or lack of it.Martin Scriha, 48, a bartender in rural Mackay, in northern Queensland who voted \u201cyes,\u201d said it was just another example of where Australia stands on social issues: \u201ca bit more behind than everywhere else.\u201dBut for now, many Australians are still trying to figure out how to make sure that the vote moves beyond symbolism to actual impact.\u201cThe general consensus is that it was a total waste of money and the government should be in touch with its people and understand its people,\u201d said Michael Duggan-Tierney, Jarrad\u2019s partner a few hours after the results came in. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a lot more respect for the Australian government once they get this sorted.

Accordingly, you may wish to perform additional research for information about this property when making your travel plans.\u201dTripAdvisor has also said it may keep posts up longer than three months if issues persist, but has not said how it would confirm whether a problem had been corrected.Ms. Love said she was \u201ca bit torn\u201d because so many victims of sexual assault have a hard time reporting it, but, \u201cI would understand\u201d if TripAdvisor wanted proof, such as a police report.Mr. Harteveldt said he thinks that TripAdvisor has an obligation to verify the authenticity of an assertion before a badge is posted, and to confirm resolution of the complaint before it is removed. \u201cAs the owner of the site where people are posting reviews, TripAdvisor should take on the responsibility to check with hotels. Doing so would actually be good for both consumers and TripAdvisor itself. That\u2019s because TripAdvisor is so strong, it would likely bring more force to hotels to correct the sources of their problems,\u201d he said.Iberostar and Ms. Love have different recollections of what happened seven years ago. Ms. Love said she \u201cbegged\u201d the lobby staff to call the police, and they refused, offering instead to call a taxi to take her to the hospital.Iberostar said the staff offered \u201call assistance possible,\u201d recommended she file a police report, and \u201coffered to accompany her to the appropriate police station.\u201dIberostar said it feels the badges that TripAdvisor posted on two of its Playa del Carmen resorts last week \u2014 the Iberostar Paraiso Maya and the adjacent Iberostar Paraiso Lindo \u2014 are unfair because \u201cthere is no evidence in any manner substantiating the allegations that have been made.\u201dAsked about whether it provided a photo lineup for the investigation into Ms. Love\u2019s complaint, the company replied: \u201cIberostar is seeking more details about the specific points you have raised. However, as you might understand, the lengthy passage of time complicates the ability to look into your questions.\u201d\u201cWith regard to the statement attributed to an insurance company that allegedly communicated with Ms. Love, Iberostar strongly disapproves of the implied threat to Ms. Love for speaking out,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said. Willis Mexico has since merged with Towers Watson, and the new company had no comment, said Josh Wozman, a spokesman for Willis Towers Watson.The other property flagged last week by TripAdvisor, the Grand Velas Riviera Maya, said internal and police reviews turned up no evidence to support an allegation made by a man to The Journal Sentinel that he was drugged and sexually assaulted while receiving a spa treatment. \u201cWe have provided thorough documentation to TripAdvisor for their committee to re-evaluate the badge\u2019s placement and look forward to seeing its removal shortly,\u201d said Megan Sterritt, a spokeswoman for the resort.In announcing its new badge on Nov. 8, TripAdvisor said that it would be based on news reports as well as comments from the TripAdvisor community. That was quickly revised to focus on media reports, along with other qualifications, including whether the allegation being made was against a resort employee, whether the issue was current, and whether any recent reviews mentioned it, a company spokesman, Kevin Carter, said.\u201cAs with any new product we roll out, we know that we\u2019ll need to make adjustments and refine the process,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re already considering a couple of changes, which we\u2019ll be happy to share at the appropriate time. We take our trusted position in the travel community very seriously and we\u2019ll continue to strive to earn that trust.\u201dAuberge Resorts, based in Mill Valley, Calif., told the paper that it did not comment on pending litigation but was taking the matter seriously.As for whether TripAdvisor could have potential liability if a traveler were assaulted, Benjamin C. Zipursky, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, said that it was unlikely because a website\u2019s ability to edit posts is protected by both state law and federal statute.Ms. Love\u2019s 2010 trip was booked by Apple Vacations. She said she had reviewed her paperwork and that it did not include any warnings from the company about crime in Mexico. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. It previously told The Journal Sentinel,\u201cEven though Apple Vacations does not own or operate the hotels, we will be recommending that all the properties to which we send guests, review their safety and security procedures and consider taking additional measures.\u201dMs. Love has continued to travel, and had even gone back to other parts of Mexico, relying on internet reviews and word of mouth to pick smaller boutique-style accommodation. But, she said, that\u2019s in the past. Having recently heard so many voices with similar stories, she won\u2019t be returning to Mexico.Advertisement"}

Declan Walsh, The Times\u2019s Cairo bureau chief, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What tech is most important for you to do your job as our correspondent in Egypt? A dented, screen-cracked iPhone is the center of my work. When I started out as a foreign correspondent 18 years ago, in Kenya, I carried a small satchel that held a tape recorder, a camera, an address book, a map and perhaps a shortwave radio. Today all of that has been squeezed into the thin black slab in my pocket.The Slack messaging app is replacing email as the way Times correspondents communicate with their editors, especially as our operation has spread out across the world. We might work with editors in London, New York or Hong Kong, depending on the story and the time of day.Equally important, you need to know when to put all that technology away. In the more paranoid corners of the Middle East, pulling out a glowing laptop in public is not a great idea.How is connectivity in Cairo and in the region when you travel on assignment? The internet can be teeth-grindingly slow in Egypt, to the point of me yelling, ridiculously, at the screen on deadline.Are Egyptians joined at the hip with their smartphones? Egyptians adore their smartphones. People have crazy-looking cases and a range of dramatic ringtones \u2014 Quranic verses for conservatives, melodramatic pop tunes for everyone else. Lionel Richie\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d and anything by Celine Dion are very popular.The flip side to the smartphone mania is that it also inspires deep paranoia among the police and some ordinary citizens, known popularly here as \u201chonorable citizens.\u201d I know people who\u2019ve been threatened with arrest for taking a photo of the Suez Canal (after the pyramids, one of Egypt\u2019s most famous features). A photographer friend was admonished by an \u201chonorable citizen\u201d for trying to take a photo of the Nile with her phone. He accused her of being a spy.What are the favorite apps or gadgets in Egypt? Are people on Facebook and using Google and Uber?On the streets of Cairo, Uber and Careem, a ride-sharing app that concentrates on the Middle East, are slugging it out for market share. As a result, cab rides can be ridiculously cheap \u2014 just a few dollars to cross town.How does the Egyptian government treat tech like social media and Western apps?With wariness and frequent hostility.All told, it\u2019s a pretty grim picture.Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life right now and why?With the phone banished to another room, I can\u2019t mindlessly scroll Twitter or Instagram at 8 o\u2019clock in the morning, and I enjoy a tiny window of mental peace.

Do I have time to meditate?It varies from person to person, but Ms. Brach generally recommends people meditate 10 to 45 minutes per day. \u201cLike gaining fitness through physical exercise, there is a value to \u2018playing your edge\u2019 with meditation, sitting a bit longer than might be your tendency,\u201d she said. \u201cEven a few minutes each day will put you on a track to develop the practice.\u201dWhen I shut my eyes, visions of unwrapped presents dance in my head. What can I do when I\u2019m distracted by thoughts?It is perfectly normal for distracting thoughts to enter your head, Ms. Duckworth said. Try returning your focus to your breath. Ms. Brach also offered a tip: \u201cDuring practice, when you realize the mind has been distracted, pause for a moment, and without judgment, reawaken your senses. Become aware of the sounds around you, the sensations and feelings throughout your body, the feeling of your breath. Knowing how to step out of the incessant inner dialogue that perpetuates stress, and re-grounding in the present moment, brings much freshness, creativity, clarity and ease to our hearts and minds.\u201dMy boss is on his eighth egg nog at the office party, and I need to center myself. Do I need to find a quiet conference room to meditate?Distraction-free locations are not necessary for meditation, the experts said, but they are recommended for beginners. With practice, you might be able to meditate during your commute. And eventually, Ms. Brach said, \u201cyou can practice informal meditation, or meeting life with a non-judging, openhearted presence, during all the activities of life: conversations, creative endeavors, sports, eating, lovemaking and taking a shower.\u201dAside from filling the air with the scent of gingerbread, what is the best way to breathe during meditation?Many meditators recommend breathing in through the nose and out the mouth, Ms. Duckworth said, but there\u2019s no right or wrong way. Really, the purpose of paying attention to the breath \u201cis to help collect the attention, quiet the mind and more fully notice the experience of the present moment,\u201d Ms. Brach said. \u201cYou will find that what deepens your meditation is not how you\u2019re attending to your breath, such as breathing through the nose, the mouth, or into the belly, but the quality of the attention itself.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:If your mood depends on the weather, you might not need to assume a lotus pose today.Tomorrow is looking even warmer.\u2022 Looking for a holiday gift for a youngster on your list?Among the top children\u2019s books were \u201cBravo!

{"Headline": "Crimes of the Caliphate: Iraqi Shepherd Bears Witness to ISIS Massacre", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAWIJA, Iraq \u2014 A shepherd heard the gunshots and the screaming.As Islamic State fighters executed at least 60 people at a remote military base in northern Iraq one day last year, he cowered in his home nearby, terrified. When it was safe to go out, he found piles of bodies; many of them he recognized as his neighbors. He buried them himself.\u201cThey were slaughtering people for all kinds of reasons, those caught using the internet, those suspected of being witches,\u201d the shepherd, Saad al-Omar, said at the site of a mass grave here on Tuesday. \u201cHere, I saw those victims, my neighbors. I saw bodies of mothers with their children. They had been shot. They had been burned. They were all dead.\u201dThat executions routinely took place in his hometown, Hawija, was well known, proudly publicized by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, during its two-and-a-half year rule in the town. But Mr. Omar\u2019s grisly knowledge represents something rare in the quest for justice \u2014 a witness who can lead the authorities to the bodies and identify many of them.In September, the United Nations Security Council empowered a special adviser to help Iraq investigate potential war crimes, including mass killings, committed by Islamic State. The adviser\u2019s team will not arrive in Iraq until early 2018. Given the limited resources and costs of forensics, it is unclear how many mass graves could be properly exhumed, let alone how many \u2014 if any \u2014 suspects could face justice.In Hawija, a small town in a flat, arid valley in southwestern Kirkuk Province, the head of civil defense, Col. Brahim Attiyah al-Jabbouri, said he fielded numerous, frantic requests each day from families searching for news of loved ones.For him, the quest for answers is deeply personal.Two of his cousins were detained by local Islamic State operatives and never seen again. One, a 45-year-old father of six, Nawaf al-Abdullah, had worked as an interpreter for American troops at the United States military base in Hawija. The Islamic State used the abandoned base, Forward Operating Base McHenry, as its execution site.\u201cCan you imagine a crueler fate?\u201d asked Colonel Jabbouri. \u201cTo be murdered by your enemy at the place\u201d where you once worked.The United States established the base in 2003 to train local residents to fight against the Al Qaeda-led insurgency. American country music stars held concerts in Hawija to build morale.By the time American forces withdrew in 2011, the jihadi organization was in tatters and Iraqis took over the Hawija compound.In 2014, the Islamic State juggernaut swept across the dusty valley, overwhelming Hawija, the base and the surrounding farming villages.Today, the gravel-and-sand terrain of the former base resembles a gruesome obstacle course, its pathways littered with human femurs and jawbones laced with broken teeth.Among the Islamic State\u2019s first targets were men who had worked in local law enforcement or with the Americans. Mr. Abdullah had done both. His younger brother, Watban, 21, had worked for the police. So the entire Abdullah family came under suspicion, according to Mr. Abdullah\u2019s sister, Saida, who spoke by phone from a camp for internally displaced Iraqis about 70 miles east of Hawija.That included Mr. Abdullah, his wife and six children, as well as Watban, a newlywed whose wife had recently given birth to a girl.For more than a year, their families tried to keep a low profile, as it was deemed too dangerous for the brothers to try to escape by slipping through the Islamic State\u2019s well-manned checkpoints. \u201cWe were far away from anyplace safe,\u201d Saida al-Abdullah said. \u201cWe had no escape.\u201dBy late 2015, the Islamic State had made executions a routine event, according to the group\u2019s own propaganda videos. They were using the former base for their charnel house, in part because it offered a well-protected and remote space that would have hindered escape and prevented others from witnessing the activities there, Colonel Jabbouri said.In January 2016, a group of Islamic State fighters drove into town, arrested Watban al-Abdullah and accused him of trying to sneak out of town, his sister said.He disappeared in their custody, and the family had no way of knowing what had become of him.Mr. Omar did. The 25-year-old shepherd lived on the outskirts of Hawija, near the former military base.In February 2016, a couple of days after Watban al-Abdullah\u2019s arrest, Mr. Omar and his family heard the gunshots and screams emanating from inside the base.Later that night, when the area appeared deserted, Mr. Omar climbed the earthen walls to see what had happened.The scene surpassed his worst nightmares. Dozens of bodies, some clothed and some burned, lay scattered across the frigid ground in large sticky pools of blood. \u201cThe stench was unbearable,\u201d Mr. Omar recalled, his weathered face pulled into a grimace. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the feeling of seeing the bodies of children, of people that my family and I knew.\u201dMr. Omar felt outrage about the killings, as well as the indignity of the unburied bodies\u2019 likely desecration by wild dogs. He shook off his fear of being discovered by Islamic State and tried to do the decent thing for the victims.By starlight, for several nights in a row, he dug several shallow pits and pulled, by his count, 60 bodies into a makeshift grave, including the body of Watban al-Abdullah, whom he recognized.\u201cSome of the bodies were burned,\u201d Mr. Omar said. \u201cSome had been tortured. But I knew him.\u201dMr. Omar got word to the Abdullah family about what he had seen. The Islamic State, however, never confirmed what happened, Mr. Abdullah\u2019s wife and sister said.That news prompted Watban al-Abdullah\u2019s older brother, Nawaf, to risk an escape from town.His wife Naeema said that the last time she saw her husband was Feb. 10, 2016. She presumes that the Islamic State caught him. She has not heard from him since he left.The next time that Islamic State fighters entered the base, it was clear that someone had trespassed.They began a search for the culprit, and immediately went to Mr. Omar\u2019s family farm, the closest homestead to the base.The Omars denied any knowledge of the burials, but the family knew Mr. Omar was no longer safe. He went into hiding. By April 2016, he and his family fled Hawija for good.\u201cI had to run away,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew my fate would have been the same as theirs if I stayed.\u201d\u201cWe are working to hunt him down,\u201d he said.More than a month after its liberation, Hawija remains a ghost town. Whole neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble, the commercial district torn apart by artillery fire. Most residents are waiting for local services to be restored before they leave their humanitarian aid camps and return.The mass grave remains untouched, the countless sun-bleached bones scattered along the sand awaiting collection and identification.Colonel Jabbouri said that although he was desperate for answers about what happened, he did not have the equipment or personnel needed for a thorough exhumation.\u201cI have dozens of people calling and writing to me on Facebook,\u201d he said, standing at the grave site. \u201cEveryone wants answers. We are frantic. But without experts, there is no way to really know who is here.\u201dFollow Margaret Coker on Twitter: @nytmargaret.Falih Hassan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Ramos, the chief executive of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, was effective immediately.The governor, Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3, told reporters that he accepted the resignation because Mr. Ramos had become a \u201cdistraction.\u201d A spokeswoman for Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said the governor had not asked for Mr. Ramos to step down.\u201cThere is an investigation that we\u2019ve called upon for the whole contracting situation,\u201d Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said in an interview. \u201cThe truth of the matter is that this decision was taken with the best interests of the people of Puerto Rico.\u201dMr. Ramos has given various contradictory explanations for why he chose Whitefish over mutual aid agreements with other utility companies, which are customary after disasters.He told The New York Times last month that he preferred Whitefish because he expected the United States Army Corps of Engineers to pay the company, which meant the bankrupt utility would not have to front any of the money for repairs. Under mutual aid agreements, Prepa would have to pay for the work and then seek reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\u201cThis is a cash flow problem for Prepa,\u201d he said.But Mr. Ramos told legislators on Tuesday that he went with the private company because he did not have the resources to find lodging for workers borrowed from other utilities. But emails released this week by the House Committee on Natural Resources show that Whitefish could not find housing, either.\u201cThere has to be some level of corruption. Otherwise, how can somebody be so incompetent?\u201d said Ramon J. Cruz, a former member of Puerto Rico\u2019s energy commission who has been following the issue closely.It had been a rough week for Mr. Ramos.On Wednesday, Mr. Ramos and the governor proudly hailed an important milestone: The company had finally reached 50 percent of its power capacity. Minutes later, a key line failed, again plunging the northern half of the island into darkness. Another line failed on Thursday.Nearly two months after the storm, the grid is generating power at 45 percent of capacity. Most homes are without power and traffic lights remain out. Several hospitals are still running on generators and thousands of small businesses are closed.On Friday, a local newspaper reported that Mr. Ramos had hired a friend who was once implicated in a federal criminal case to help advise the company. Mr. Ramos posted a cheerful technical update in a video on Facebook defending the consultant, whom he described as an experienced electrical engineer. Twenty minutes later, the company announced that Mr. Ramos had quit.\u201cIt\u2019s shocking that it took so long,\u201d said Austin Evers, executive director of American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group that is investigating the contract. \u201cAnd I also think it\u2019s critical that investigations continue, because it\u2019s not credible that Mr. Ramos was the only person involved in this.\u201dPrepa is the largest of Puerto Rico\u2019s many government enterprises, responsible for $9 billion of the government\u2019s $74 billion debt. It was also the first branch of the government to go broke, running out of cash in 2014. Since then, its lenders have kept it afloat with money to buy fuel and repay its older debts.Sheri Fink and Mary Williams Walsh contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Sense of the U.S. Case Against AT&T-Time Warner", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAT&T and Time Warner are trying to merge into a nationwide internet, satellite television and media powerhouse.Here is what you need to know to make sense of the government\u2019s case:Why was the government\u2019s decision such a surprise?AT&T and Time Warner do not directly compete against each other. So their combination, known in the business world as a vertical merger, would not reduce the number of companies in the telecommunications or media markets. That is a key test of competition for antitrust officials.For about four decades mergers like this one passed regulatory muster, notably Comcast\u2019s union with NBC in 2011 and Time Warner\u2019s merger with AOL in 2000. The Justice Department has been more critical of mergers between companies that directly compete, what antitrust officials call horizontal mergers. In 2015, the agency blocked another Comcast deal, that time to buy Time Warner Cable, a cable company that is a separate company from Time Warner. The agency said that combining the two cable and broadband providers would reduce options for consumers and have too much power.Then why are antitrust officials doing this? Makan Delrahim, less than two months into his job as the head of the antitrust division at the Justice Department, has arrived with a very different approach to merger reviews.He has said that he is not opposed to vertical mergers in general. But he said he disagreed with how anticompetitive concerns for these deals have been handled in the past.Traditionally, antitrust officials have addressed concerns by making companies agree to abstain from anticompetitive practices. In the case of the Comcast-NBC Universal deal, Comcast promised to share NBC programming with streaming companies like Netflix, for example. These sort of arrangements are called behavioral remedies.But Mr. Delrahim believes that those agreements are difficult to police and often do not work. If there are anticompetitive harms, he says, the companies should be willing to sell off assets to allay those concerns.Why does Mr. Delrahim criticize behavioral remedies?Mr. Delrahim, a Republican who served at the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration, believes the government should not expend a lot of resources on merger enforcement. He thinks consent decrees with behavioral conditions turn the Justice Department into a regulatory agency that has to police those settlements for years.In a speech at the American Bar Association this month, Mr. Delrahim said, \u201cLike any regulatory scheme, behavioral remedies require centralized decisions instead of a free market process.\u201d He added that if a deal is anticompetitive, \u201cwe should only accept a clean and complete solution.\u201dAre regulators rethinking antitrust more broadly?Corporate consolidation, particularly in the tech and media sectors, has become a bipartisan concern. Lawmakers say they are worried about the power of Facebook over public opinion and Amazon\u2019s great reach across retail, media, and business services like cloud storage.There is a call for regulators to think more creatively about antitrust. A common test for antitrust officials is whether customers will be harmed. Many tech companies easily pass that test because they offer handy, free or inexpensive products. But critics of existing laws say that the big companies may be hurting competition in other ways, by preventing start-ups from succeeding or innovating, that are more difficult to measure.Advertisement"}

This time it was to India, where I learned a ton that I didn\u2019t know: I found India trying to leapfrog out of poverty and catch up to China by engaging in a rapid digitization of its entire economy and power grid.Yes, while our president has been busy playing golf, tweeting about LaVar Ball and pushing an anything-that-will-pass tax plan, China has been busy creating a cashless society, where people can pay for so many things now with just a swipe of their cellphones \u2014 including donations to beggars \u2014 or even buy stuff at vending machines with just facial recognition, and India is trying to follow suit.These are big trends, and in a world where data is the new oil, China and India are each creating giant pools of digitized data that their innovators are using to write all kinds of interoperable applications \u2014 for cheap new forms of education, medical insurance, entertainment, banking and finance.I was blown away by one big change in India in particular. In 2009, my friend Nandan Nilekani, the tech entrepreneur, led a team of experts that helped the then-Congress Party-led government launch a national digital identity system, known as Aadhaar (Hindi for \u201cbase\u201d).Every Indian, rich or poor, goes into a field office, has fingerprints and irises scanned into a biometric database and then linked to the individual\u2019s 12-digit ID number with basic identifiers: name, address, date of birth and sex. When the Congress Party left office in 2014, and Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party took over, Modi continued and impressively energized the Aadhaar project, bringing it today to 1.18 billion users, out of a population of about 1.3 billion.In a country where many poor people lacked any form of ID, like a birth certificate or a driver\u2019s license, this has been a revolution, because they can now open a bank account and get government aid sent directly to them \u2014 rather than having bureaucrats, bankers or postal workers skim off 30 percent each year through the mail \u2014 and then link their bank account to their mobile phones, from which they can buy, sell, transfer money and receive payments digitally anytime anywhere.The digital network platforms that have broken the one-billion-plus user mark \u2014 like Facebook, Google and WhatsApp \u2014 all came out of the private sector. Aadhaar, noted the Harvard Business Review, is the only non-U.S. platform \u201cto have broken the one-billion-user threshold and the only such system to have been developed by the public sector.\u201d It also has the distinction of \u201chaving reached one billion users the fastest.\u201dWhen the British laid railroads in India it led to the more efficient extraction of natural resources. Now the Indian government, through the combination of a trusted unique ID platform \u2014 tied to cellphones and mobile bank accounts \u2014 is creating a kind of digital railroad enabling the more efficient empowerment of human resources.\u201cIt\u2019s transforming the lives of ordinary people,\u201d explained Alok Kshirsagar, a McKinsey partner based in Mumbai. \u201cMillions are already benefiting from digital payments and credit. There are already more than 30 percent productivity gains when digital capabilities are used in agriculture, transportation and manufacturing. We are in the early stages of a transformation that could generate as much as $1 trillion in economic value over the next seven to 10 years.\u201dNow any Indian farmer can just go to one of 250,000 government community centers \u2014 each with a computer, Wi-Fi and a local entrepreneur who manages it \u2014 log into a government digital services website with the farmer\u2019s unique ID and instantly print out a birth certificate or land records needed for transactions.An Indian friend told me: \u201cMy driver has two bank accounts, and he has given one debit card to his wife and another to his son. And now he tells me he puts X amount of his salary into one account and Y into another, using his cellphone, so his wife is empowered and not asking her mother-in-law for money, because she has her own debit card, and the son, who is off in school training to be a doctor, can be independent.\u201dNilekani and his wife, Rohini, have built a foundation, EkStep, to create mobile education apps to help parents, teachers and students \u2014 armed only with cellphones \u2014 to learn faster, using these new digital networks. As Shankar Maruwada, an EkStep co-founder and its C.E.O., explained: Unlike, say Facebook, whose business model is to \u201cretain your attention,\u201d EkStep, Aadhaar and other such \u201csocietal platforms\u201d are designed to \u201crestore your agency,\u201d particularly to the poor.The West got economically rich \u201cbefore it got data rich,\u201d added Pramod Varma, EKStep\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cSo when data came along, it just became a better way to sell you things. They could target you better; you became a better customer for them. But in a country like India, where per-capita income is $2,000, today you can get data rich before you get economically rich. And if you empower people with their data, they can use their data to get better loans, get better skills, and build a digital repository that captures their skills to get better salaries.\u201dSimilar innovations are going on in energy, explained Mahesh Kolli, president of Greenko, India\u2019s largest renewable power provider. Theft of electricity from state-owned distribution companies amounted to some 20 percent of their output, as people strung wires to siphon from the grid, or the companies couldn\u2019t identify users.Now the government \u201ccan link my unique ID to my electricity bill\u201d and then directly and digitally connect my government subsidy, if I am poor, to that electric bill, said Kolli. Greenko just built the largest solar project in the world \u2014 a 3,000-acre field of Chinese-made solar panels generating 800 megawatts powering over 600,000 homes in Andhra Pradesh. Two more such fields are on the way up, all connecting to the national grid.Oh, and by the way, for those of you who want to preserve coal jobs, this 800-megawatt solar farm \u201cwas built with over 5,000 skilled and semiskilled workers,\u201d said Kolli. \u201cWe believe the renewable energy sector will create over one million new generation jobs to meet the 175-gigawatt target set by Prime Minister Modi.\u201dGreenko builds these plants, he added, \u201cin five months using Chinese panels and European inverter-grid integration technologies made in India.\u201d (Notice the absence of U.S. technology in that loop.) Greenko is also making huge strides in battery technology to store solar energy, so it can be used when the sun is not shining, and the company is now in the midst of building the first grid-connected battery storage system integrated with its solar farms.\u201cNo new coal or gas power plants are being built in India today,\u201d he added, \u201cnot because of regulations, but because solar, wind, hydro are all now able to compete with coal plants without subsidies.\u201dBottom line, the Indian energy economy is rapidly transitioning to a \u201cdecarbonized, digitized and decentralized\u201d system, said Kolli, enabling better quality of life while meeting big energy needs \u2014 without the government having to deal with all the protests that come with building coal- or gas-fired plants.So while we\u2019ve been following Trump\u2019s tweets about bringing back \u201cbeautiful coal,\u201d India built a billion-user ID network bigger than Twitter and giant solar power plants that are cheaper than coal.That\u2019s what you missed \u2014 and that\u2019s just one country. Are you tired of winning yet?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rev-Up: Imagining a 20% Self-Driving World", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "Call it 20 percent: the day, if it ever arrives, that one out of five vehicles you encounter will be driving itself. In some ways, the 20 percent era is harder to imagine than the fully automated era, because this supposedly unstoppable and frictionless technology will still be embroiled in a total mess. The best, safest models will most likely come with the highest price tags, out of reach for those with average incomes. Coexistence between human and robot drivers will be uneasy at best; road rage against the machine will boil over. One catastrophic accident could still imperil the whole experiment, no matter what the overall statistics show.But that inevitable mess is precisely what makes the one-in-five future so interesting to ponder. It\u2019s the first point, give or take, when it will be clear that a true self-driving future is even possible. When car companies will actually be able to rip out the steering wheels from some models, designing them in entirely different ways. When big trucking firms and car services like Uber will have begun to remove drivers from their vehicles. When hypercommuters will trust their cars to drive them three hours to the office while they sleep. When you might risk putting your child in one, alone.The autonomous vehicle went from test-track prototype to showroom reality far faster than I envisioned, propelled as much by advances in sensors and A.I. as by a collective hype cycle that seemed intent on willing these devices into existence, whether society was ready for them or not. Sitting with that \u201cbeginner\u201d driver in 2008, as engineers closely observed its movements, took me back to that life-defining moment of getting a driver\u2019s license. In my wallet, sparse with a library card and a school-lunch ticket, the license had real heft. It represented a primordial entry point to adulthood, a vast expansion of social possibility.As a rite, the driver\u2019s exam \u2014 I have failed it in two countries \u2014 is a ritual by turns (three-point, of course!) tedious and terrifying. If you can summon nothing else of the 1988 teen comedy \u201cLicense to Drive,\u201d you can still see James Avery\u2019s gleefully malevolent D.M.V. examiner, wielding his famous coffee cup. Once autonomous technology begins to really take off, will the driver\u2019s license, and the pedagogy behind it, go the way of the stick shift? Will the ability to drive begin to seem some exotic, rarely necessary skill \u2014 like starting a fire with a flint?After all, in a vehicle that meets the Level 5 automation criteria of SAE International \u2014 \u201cfull-time performance by an Automated Driving System for all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions\u201d \u2014 there would seem to be little point in possessing this vestigial skill. We don\u2019t require people entering elevators, riding in airport trams or letting Roombas loose upon their living rooms to be able to take over operation in case of machine failure; it\u2019s hard to see why our interaction with this automated technology should be any different. Our learning process could be as quick and dirty as it is with other high-tech products: Toss out the instruction manual and watch someone do it on YouTube.But this possibility, driver made passenger, broaches new territory in jurisprudence. With no licenses, what is the legal basis for restricting anyone \u2014 tweens, the elderly \u2014 from being ferried about? Young farm kids\u2019 driving the family truck seems as obsolete as tail fins, but what\u2019s stopping kids from being driven? Could children, often more adept at handling the smartphones of their parents than their owners are, have an advantage on older drivers less accustomed to technology? Yet the same fears that keep parents from letting their children walk to school may prevail over the allure of their autonomous vehicle handling the school run. It seems hard to say whether autonomous vehicles would hasten or delay the passage to adulthood.And as drivers interact with semiautonomous vehicles in the long run-up to Level 5, driver education and licensing, far from becoming obsolete, may become more important, argues John D. Lee, a professor of engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cAutomation has a strong tendency to surprise people with unexpected behavior,\u201d he says. Knowing what your car is doing \u2014 and when to take over \u2014 could be more vital than merely knowing how to drive. That water on the road \u2014 is it a surface puddle, or a veritable lake filling a gigantic pothole? That truck ahead with the dangerously swaying load \u2014 do you speed up to pass it? Is the pedestrian by the marked crosswalk waiting for you to yield or simply checking his iPhone? \u201cDriving and managing the automation that is helping you drive,\u201d Lee says, \u201care two quite different skill sets. Automation-management skills need to be learned as much as driving skills.\u201dTom Vanderbilt is the author of \u201cYou May Also Like\u201d and \u201cTraffic.\u201dDriverless cars will sometimes need to move around the city with no humans in them at all \u2014 en route to pickups or drop-offs. As empty moving vehicles become a common sight, they\u2019re sure to enable an annoying off-label use: a flowering youth subculture of external joy riding, similar to subway surfing.All over the country, bored teenagers will lurk on the roadside, waiting to leap onto the roofs of empty cars, hanging on for as long as they can. The surfers will take advantage of advances in cloaking technology to help them confuse the cars\u2019 sensors. Some will develop a clever assortment of grips and attachments to help them stay on, although the best among them will sneer at those who need to use tools. Fatalities will be inevitable, and often gruesome.To keep the kids off, car owners will try to coat their cars in slick repellents; these will be effective but too messy to be practical. Soon, dealers of autonomous cars will offer optional rows of spikes similar to those we already use to keep homeless people off benches. Once again, design will become more hostile in the name of safety.Rollo Romig is a journalist based in New York.Liberated from having to watch the road, commuters\u2019 eyes will be free to \u2014 what else? \u2014 consume video content. Sound\u2019s hold on drive time \u2014 first with terrestrial radio, then satellite radio, then podcasts \u2014 will gave way to sight. But what kind of videos will we watch? If Marchetti\u2019s constant holds (this is the idea that as transportation technology and urban planning change, people contort their lives to keep their commutes to an average of one hour per day), they will be not feature films but TV shows and short videos of the kind being increasingly produced for Facebook and YouTube. Podcasts will be displaced by vodcasts. Media companies are already negotiating with carmakers about how to price their offerings. Should in-car entertainment work more like cable or like the on-demand system in a hotel? Like Netflix or like Roku?Most riders who play games will use their phones. But by the time one in five cars is autonomous, console makers will develop specific products for it. The nearly two hours a day of console gaming played by some 60 million Americans will tick up accordingly. Swarms of commuters hitting the morning and evening roads in waves will become swarms of druids or mercenaries in massively multiplayer online games, some of which might come to incorporate the driving experience itself, a Pok\u00e9mon Go for the highway.It seems less likely that we\u2019ll use this opportunity to steal time back from screens. But if there\u2019s enough space for a table, maybe commuters will sit around it playing poker or telling stories. Cars are, indeed, the most private places we have, sealed shut, out of earshot. (The writer Nicholson Baker has said that he likes to write while in a car parked in a shady spot.)Chris Anderson \u2014 formerly the editor of Wired, now the head of a drone-data company and, in his spare time, of a racing league for autonomous cars \u2014 says the question of what we\u2019ll do inside self-driving cars always comes up at cocktail parties. It always confounds him. \u201cWe have this world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s called the back seat of an Uber.\u201d We already know what passengers do in back seats, be they in a limo or an R.V. or a tour bus: They pull out their phones or their iPads, or they talk to one another, or they take a nap. Why should we think that not having a driver will change anything?In an essay for Real Life magazine titled \u201cPerpetual Motion Machines,\u201d Chenoe Hart argues that we miss something when we think of autonomous cars this way, as a difference in degree, not in kind. Because we won\u2019t have to worry about driving, vehicle interiors can expand to a point where we\u2019 stop thinking of them as vehicles: They might have fully functional kitchens, or gyms, or beds. Instead of going to the coffee shop, the coffee shop might come to you; instead of going into the garage to pull out your car, the garage will be the car. The ability to summon spaces like this, Hart writes, will turn the built environment into a kind of random-access memory \u2014 with every destination equally accessible from anywhere. Whether it drove to you or you to it will be irrelevant; motion will be so smooth and constant as to be imperceptible. Hart argues that when travel becomes fully autonomous, we will always be traveling: families or co-workers in quiet concert on giant roads, moving in a cluster of moving buildings, chasing good weather, hardly aware that we\u2019re going anywhere at all.James Somers is a writer and programmer based in New York.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.It\u2019s not as straightforward as it sounds. For one thing, the vehicles would not be freed from the laws of physics. Should your car abruptly brake while you were, for example, running on a treadmill, the treadmill would cease moving forward \u2014 but you wouldn\u2019t, at least until you hit a windshield or door.It might be easier to remain seated. \u201cThe car could have special pockets all over the place that hold resistance bands of different strengths,\u201d says Bryant Johnson, a personal trainer and the author of \u201cThe Ruth Bader Ginsburg Workout.\u201d \u201cYou could use those to get a full-body strength-training workout.\u201dThroughout your commute, your future car could scrutinize your efforts, says Steve McCauley, the head of health services for the Wynn Las Vegas resort, with fingertip monitors or other sensors tracking your heart rate and the composition of your sweat.But realistically, many of us will use our salvaged commuting time otherwise. In tomorrow\u2019s cars, the area beneath the hood may not be needed for a combustion engine, Vujicic says \u2014 but it will remain, for reasons of mechanical stability and safety. Fitted with some padding and a safety belt, it becomes a napping cave.If self-driving cars start to make up a significant portion of urban traffic, they\u2019re likely to push cities to become more populous and compact, with fewer owned vehicles and more car sharing. The future, that is, would look more like Singapore, one of the world\u2019s densest cities, whose government in recent years has tried to curb car ownership and ease congestion problems. We reached out to Limin Hee, the director of research at Singapore\u2019s Center for Livable Cities, to ask her about how she thinks autonomous cars will begin to change urban life.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.These exploits, though dramatic, took advantage of the same vulnerabilities in cellular networks that might plague any tablet or smart vacuum cleaner. But a future in which one in five vehicles is autonomous will not only increase the attack \u201csurface\u201d (in the metaphor favored by researchers) of the car; it will also force manufacturers to confront more insidious security risks that are only now coming into view. It will become possible to compromise vehicles by hacking the environment.A car that drives itself uses sensors to construct high-resolution images of its surroundings, then runs them through a \u201cclassifier\u201d to identify all the objects in the image. The classifier can do this because it has trained on labeled images; after seeing a hundred thousand trucks, it learns to recognize certain features as indicating truck-ness. Today\u2019s most popular and effective classifiers for object recognition, used widely in self-driving car software, are called deep neural networks.But a deep neural network offers researchers very little understanding of why objects become classified as they do. Think of its output as a map, with each classification corresponding, like a ZIP code, to some demarcated region. Instead of existing in just two dimensions, though, the map has more like a thousand dimensions \u2014 and the slightest move in any one of these dimensions can push us into a different ZIP code and produce a false classification. This makes it possible for a hacker to construct slightly perturbed images, called \u201cadversarial examples,\u201d that look innocuous to the human eye but fool the car\u2019s brain into making the wrong call, with potentially fatal consequences.Adversarial examples are extremely difficult to defend against. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand these attacks,\u201d says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut the deeper question is that we don\u2019t understand deep neural networks.\u201d In a recent paper, Song and her co-authors introduced a method of constructing robust adversarial examples that can even be printed on paper and pasted to road signs. A stop sign defaced with specially calibrated graffiti, for instance, is recognized as a 45 m.p.h. speed-limit sign.Song\u2019s warning extends beyond road infrastructure. While researchers for decades have been working on \u2014 and developing countermeasures for \u2014 software vulnerabilities, the study of security issues related to deep learning is still in its infancy. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a precise mathematical definition of a pedestrian,\u201d Song says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for us to write down a formula describing exactly what a pedestrian is. So we can\u2019t even really define our security goals.\u201d Even with a recent surge of interest in adversarial examples, researchers are still struggling to understand the scope of the problem. Given the physical-world ramifications, Song says, \u201cwe should have started even sooner.\u201dYiren Lu is a writer and software engineer in New York.The trickiest part of the transition to a self-driving future may be figuring out liability when accidents do happen. Instead of quarreling only about which driver was at fault, we will also be able to argue about whether the self-driving features in either car may have played a role. A preview of these complications was evident in the aftermath of the crash that killed Joshua Brown, the Ohio man whose autopiloted Tesla ran into a tractor-trailer. Federal investigators determined that the accident was not caused by a defect in the autopilot software, and Tesla has said repeatedly that drivers should always have their hands on the wheel even when they are using the technology. But officials noted that Tesla\u2019s technology was unable to detect cross-traffic like that presented by the tractor-trailer. Tesla subsequently updated its software to make similar accidents less likely in the future.So who was responsible for covering the damages? The insurance policy that covered Brown, who may not have fully understood the capabilities of his car, or Tesla? Neither Tesla nor Brown\u2019s family has commented on who paid. And both car insurers and insurance regulators have been relatively slow to contend with the difficulty in assigning liability when a person is driving a car only part of the time. \u201cInsurance policies have not necessarily caught up with the global advancement of A.I. technology in cars,\u201d Brown\u2019s lawyer told me.Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley, which is racing to raise the curtain on the era of autonomous vehicles, is also thinking about insurance. A start-up called Driav intends to bring down insurance rates by monitoring the reams of data coming out of self-driving cars in order to figure out, on a second-to-second basis, who or what caused the errors that led to a crash. \u201cIt\u2019s silly that claims are a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 argument,\u201d Dan Peate, Driav\u2019s chief executive, told me. \u201cThe data can just tell us what happened.\u201d The company hopes to begin offering insurance policies next year, with the expectation that they will be cheaper in part because the cars will be in fewer accidents and in part because it plans to be able to shift some liability onto the carmakers.In the long run, when all vehicles are driving themselves, the manufacturers themselves are very likely to assume all of the blame for accidents. Most such companies have said that they plan to pay for anything that happens while their cars and software are in charge. When that\u2019s the case, insurance begins to look a lot more like a product warranty, covered by the carmaker, than a stand-alone product that a customer has to worry about. But in the transition years until then, there are likely to be a lot more messy arguments.Nathaniel Popper is a technology reporter for The Times.When I think about the future these days, I inevitably return to a tweet from the writer Elizabeth Hamilton-Argyropoulos (a.k.a. @bourgeoisalien): \u201cThe saddest part about self-driving cars will be all the times people die mid-trip and then ur dinner guests or pizza guy will arrive dead.\u201d To read this joke is to become immediately certain that this will absolutely happen \u2014 of course it will! \u2014 and that it will furthermore become as much a part of the texture of everyday future life as, say, traffic delays caused by collisions are now. Admittedly, the dead-pizza-guy notion doesn\u2019t seem very likely: A large part of the impetus behind the development of self-driving technology in the first place is the desire to do away with the need for flesh-and-blood people who demand wages for their work. But the image feels symbolically resonant precisely because of the ghostly future of all those moribund jobs. Self-driving cars bearing the earthly remains of the recently deceased \u2014 automated Ubers, say, with heart-attack victims sprawled incredulously across the rear seat \u2014 are, in this sense, an extreme metaphor for the near future of capitalism. The technology will be miraculous, yes; but if it functions as intended, it will serve as an uncanny vector of human obsolescence.Mark O\u2019Connell is a writer based in Dublin.\u201cRide-sharing\u201d was always a misnomer for companies like Uber and Lyft. As with the rest of the \u201csharing economy,\u201d nothing was ever being shared; labor and services were being bought and sold. But as ride-share companies have grown, their ambitions have multiplied and compounded. Currently, their horizons are limited by widespread car ownership, alternative transit options and, primarily, their own cost. But autonomous cars make their grander plans \u2014 dreams of vast fleets of perfectly allocated and used vehicles \u2014 more plausible. They zero out a single variable, the cost of labor, that these companies believe is holding them back from utterly reshaping the world. Ride-share businesses are uniquely poised to manifest and demonstrate the big ideas of self-driving cars. They aren\u2019t waiting for this change; they\u2019re doing everything in their power to hasten it. Autonomous cars aren\u2019t just part of the plan; they are the plan.Conservative estimates put the world\u2019s Ubers and Lyfts in an enviable position as self-driving cars roll out. Bullish projections put them in an unassailable one. A 2017 report by Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest, told the story in four numbers. A rider\u2019s \u201call-in cost per mile\u201d for average United States taxi services was about $3.50. For a human-driven Uber in San Francisco, that number was about $2.86. Assuming the same fuel price, the figure for personal cars is much lower, at around 70 cents. The estimate for self-driving taxi services, circa 2020, would cut that cost in half.At 35 cents per mile, tasks that were previously too expensive or that would have felt ridiculous become reasonable and routine. A world in which moving yourself or moving things to you costs almost nothing in terms of money or attention would remake places and transform lives. It would also bring with it new and complicated absurdities \u2014 the sort Americans adapt to quickly and then forget. (Like bottles of water shipped around the world and sold for $2, or electronics products assembled in one country from parts from six others, to be shipped to a seventh.)Riders will thrill to this new infrastructure as it incorporates the roads around them, providing novel experiences and conveniences. But this excitement will prevent us from seeing that our aspiring fleet managers hope to create something like the profound consolidation of the internet\u2019s recent past. Just as Amazon the online store laid the groundwork for Amazon the comprehensive and omnipresent service, apps for human-driven taxis may have laid the groundwork for a thrumming on-demand grid, on which people and things can be placed and retrieved.Like Google and Facebook before them, which remapped, rerouted and dominated the old and diverse web infrastructure on which they were built, Uber and Lyft could say, credibly, that they work better with size and full participation. That market domination is merely the flip side of completeness. They will aspire to monopoly and could achieve, with startling speed, real and unprecedented claims over the roads we share \u2014 they will say they\u2019ve found a better use for them, and if all goes to plan, riders will agree.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The Times.Unless you\u2019re a millionaire or a truck driver, your first encounter with a self-driving vehicle will probably be a car you ordered through a ride-hailing app like Lyft or Uber. These companies, which spent the first stage of their lives trying to get drivers into their cars, are spending the next one trying to get them out. There will be some initial awkwardness around self-driving vehicles, just as there was around ride-hailing in the first place. (Remember when it was weird to get into a stranger\u2019s unmarked car?)But Lyft, for one, is betting that it can put a trustable face on the tech. In July, it announced Level 5, a lab where it will work on its own driverless software, in addition to developing an open self-driving network that companies like Ford and Jaguar Land Rover will be able to plug their vehicles into. The idea of the network is to combine multiple kinds of autonomous vehicles under one routing-and-request system, so that when you order a Lyft, the app will assess your route, check the weather and other factors and send you the best ride, whether that\u2019s an autonomous Waymo or a human-driven S.U.V. John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s co-founder and president, explained its thinking.Kevin Roose is a business columnist for The Times and a writer at large for the magazine.For reasons that have gone unstudied, humans become horny in transit. With the proliferation of subway systems came the proliferation of subway gropers. With commercial air travel came the \u201cMile High Club.\u201d Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee filmed their famous sex tape on a boat (I\u2019m told). There\u2019s something about transportation that gets people in the mood. What is it?My theory is simple. In our capacity as humans, we have three speeds at which we operate: crawl, walk and run. In other words: extremely slow, slow and slightly less slow. When we engage with equipment that increases our velocity, we become excited. This excitement applies in all cases, whether we\u2019re talking about an escalator, a moving walkway, a bicycle, a roller coaster, a golf cart or a Chrysler LeBaron. It is fundamentally thrilling to travel at an unexpected speed. When the enabling mode of transportation is one that permits our excitement to be processed as erotic energy \u2014 even if that processing is specifically legislated against \u2014 some of us will do that. The distance between \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cstimulated\u201d is, after all, incredibly short. If there were a way to have sex on a bicycle, people would be bike-sexing all the time. It would have its own verb.Having sex in a car is not currently impossible, but it is difficult. Hand-eye coordination, a mechanism critical for sex-having, is compromised for the driver, whose hands must remain on the wheel and eyes on the road. In road couplings, the driver is not an equal contributor. Unless, of course, the driver doesn\u2019t need to drive at all. Which brings us to the self-driving car: basically a motel room on wheels. The one hindrance to this development is existing public-lewdness laws, which are fairly expansive. You can\u2019t intentionally get naked and perform a \u201clewd act\u201d in a public place without risk of penalty. Obviously. But you also run a risk if you perform your lewd act in a private place with the intention of being watched \u2014 say, in a self-driven automobile slowly cruising past a school bus where my future grandchildren are watching in horror as a frenzied orgy unfolds within smelling distance. I am confident, however, that the law will be updated to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable car-based encounters.And if not, industrial designers can come up with clever \u201csolves,\u201d the word that start-ups use for some reason instead of \u201csolutions.\u201d If car windows no longer need to function as navigating aids, why not tint them to inky obscurity? Or replace them with mirrors facing outward? Or mirrors facing inward? Or remove them entirely? Future riders may not even need a human partner in order to have an intimate appointment. Nissan is working with Microsoft to develop an \u201cin-vehicle virtual personal assistant\u201d which, if deviously hacked, could provide the 21st-century equivalent of phone sex.More interesting than the aesthetics of car sex will be the cultural consequences. New slang terms will arise. New positions. New trophies. (How many times can you have sex in the time it takes to drive from Las Vegas to Los Angeles?) Virginities will be lost, children conceived, marriage vows consummated and violated. Car-based kinks will be minted and postcoital rituals established. New professional opportunities will emerge: interior decorators who specialize in \u201cself-driving bedrooms\u201d; entrepreneurs who launch apps to enable no-strings-attached in-car assignations. Preferences will be identified and explored. The world will expand in narrow but pulse-quickening ways \u2014 not a sexual revolution, but a plot twist.Molly Young is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico on Her Mind: How to Help a Stricken Island Called Home", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor two weeks after the devastation of Hurricane Maria in September, Frances Westerman, a retiree from Kent in northwestern Connecticut, said she got information from Puerto Rico only in dribs and drabs. Power and cellular towers were down and she couldn\u2019t connect with anyone at the condo complex in the island\u2019s southwest where she spends the winter every year.\u201cIt was very scary the first days,\u201d Ms. Westerman, 85, said of trying to find out what was going on from afar. \u201cWe also have family in Florida and we were going berserk with the hurricanes.\u201dSeasonal visitors to Puerto Rico \u2014 snowbirds, repeat tourists, those who spend the Christmas holiday with family or friends \u2014 joined in the collective hand-wringing over the aftermath of this year\u2019s powerful storms.Compelled by the devastation, many visitors have been monitoring the news on social media, sending over money and packages with supplies like bottled water and even signing up to volunteer in clean up and rebuilding efforts.And adjusting to the new reality, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company said it is working with hotels and tour operators to offer package deals at discounted rates to allow guests to combine vacation days with a volunteer stint in the recovery effort, a mix of volunteering and tourism known as \u201cvoluntourism\u201d that has become increasingly common in other parts of the world.A similar effort is underway in the United States Virgin Islands, another American territory in the Caribbean whose three islands \u2014 St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix \u2014 suffered modest to crippling losses from the one-two punch of Hurricanes Maria and Irma within a two-week span.But many loyal visitors, especially those with relatives, friends and property in the affected areas, say they are still planning to travel to their getaways, eager to somehow help out, if only by injecting tourist dollars into battered economies.That would be me.I have lived in several states for more than 40 years but was born and raised in San Juan and visit every New Year\u2019s Eve with my husband, Jim. In the agonizing first weeks after Hurricane Maria swept through Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, I learned about the fate of my sister and extended family, including a cousin with Alzheimer\u2019s living in a home for the elderly, at an excruciatingly slow pace and only through sporadic emails, texts, Facebook postings and snippets of phone conversations before the calls dropped. It was hard to sleep at night.My attention turned then to the touchstones and places that give Puerto Rico its beauty and culture and that I now realize I have taken for granted all my life.Ms. Westerman, who eventually confirmed the well-being of both her neighbors and condo and who has been mailing checks to some friends to help them cope, said she planned to see for herself.She and her husband were planning to go back this year for their usual December to mid-April stay in Boquer\u00f3n, a beach village in the town of Cabo Rojo on the southwestern tip of the island, with one condition \u2014 they will not fly down until the electricity is back on.\u201cIf worst comes to worst we go a month later,\u201d she said.Neighboring St. Thomas and St. John in the United States Virgin Islands had not fared much better.\u201cPower lines are strewn across our roads; utility poles snapped in half like matchsticks; boats lie sunken in the harbors; many thousands of our homes stand heavily damaged or destroyed and some of our major road systems are impassable,\u201d Gov. Kenneth E. Mapp of the United States Virgin Islands wrote in an Oct. 12 letter to Congress, estimating that rebuilding would cost $5.5 billion.In the meantime, tourism officials, hoteliers and others in the service industry were scrambling to get hotels, beaches and tourist attractions back on their feet to salvage at least part of their peak tourist season, a crucial economic engine that runs from mid-November to April 1.The Environmental Protection Agency and local government officials have warned against bathing in beaches, rivers and streams because of possible raw sewage discharges as a result of hurricane damage to treatment plants.In St. Thomas and St. John, major hotels have closed for 6 to 18 months and officials expected a significant decline in overnight visitors.\u201cWe lost the last quarter of the year,\u201d said Beverly Nicholson Doty, commissioner of tourism for the United States Virgin Islands.But tourism officials in the American Caribbean acknowledged that Irma, which made landfall in the Virgin Islands on Sept. 6 as a Category 5 hurricane, and Maria, which hit Puerto Rico barely short of that magnitude as a Category 4, were like no other hurricanes in recent history because of their power and overwhelming reach. In Puerto Rico, hardly a corner of the island was spared its destruction, officials said.A boat destroyed by Hurricane Irma in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.\u201cA hurricane like this changes the profile of tourists,\u201d Mr. Izquierdo said. \u201cThe diaspora now takes a greater prominence.\u201dThe disaster relief group, based in Massachusetts, had received more than 1,600 applications by the end of October but can accommodate only about 70 volunteers at any given time in spartan quarters. People can come for as long as they want to work in cleanup, mold remediation, building temporary classrooms and permanent reconstruction, among other efforts.Erik Dyson, All Hands executive director and chief executive, said the organization planned to extend its work to Puerto Rico by early 2018.\u201cAnyone can help,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for people to carry things. There\u2019s a lot of not highly skilled jobs.\u201dOne volunteer who arrived in early November, Sid Sharma, 48, of Allen, Tex., spent his honeymoon 26 years ago in St. Thomas, which he remembered as \u201clush, green and beautiful.\u201d A general contractor who does residential remodeling, he committed to three weeks of volunteer work.\u201cSeeing the devastation on the news, I just had a little time on my hands and a push from my heart,\u201d said Mr. Sharma, who is still married and the father of two children. \u201cThis is something that I should be doing.\u201d\u201cAt least you\u2019re doing something,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just feel so helpless up here.\u201dTourism officials say they have not totally given up on leisure travelers. Mr. Izquierdo noted that big attractions like Old San Juan suffered only \u201cminimal\u201d structural damage (although it lost many trees).And, he added: \u201cAt the core of every successful tourism destination is the quality of the people and hospitality, and that wasn\u2019t washed away by the hurricane. That\u2019s stronger than ever.\u201dBut some in the tourism industry warned that a minimum level of services is required to lure travelers back. Jack Richards, president and chief executive of Pleasant Holidays in Los Angeles, which books trips for 23 countries in the Caribbean, said that the destination must have electricity, phone service, internet, clean water and medical supplies \u2014 and no public health issues.\u201cGiven the level of devastation in Puerto Rico,\u201d Mr. Richards said, \u201cit\u2019ll take a long time for things to get restored.\u201dPuerto Rico residents like my younger sister, Mari Navarro, and two nephews were still living day to day in a kind of surreal, stressed-out world as November approached. Our family home in San Juan, not far from the airport, suffered only minor damages except for the landscaping, which was gone. But without electricity Mari was cooking on a small gas stove, washing clothes and towels by hand and using flashlights to see at night.My sister had prepared well for Hurricane Maria, but supplies were running low and she asked me to send D batteries for flashlights and a battery-powered fan. She had to line up for food and bottled water at stores.She was back on the job as an account executive with a health insurer but she avoided driving except to work, she told me, because most traffic lights were not working. On a recent outing, two cars in front of her had crashed into each other, setting off a panic attack.\u201cI\u2019m grateful that I have a roof over my head, that we\u2019re all working and that we\u2019re doing better than a lot of people,\u201d she told me over the phone, \u201cbut sometimes it\u2019s hard not to get depressed.\u201dThen she burst into tears. And I teared up too.Mireya Navarro is a former New York Times reporter and an author who was born and raised in San Juan, P.R.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Corporate Taxes, Musk vs. Buffett, and Will Fox Strike a Deal?", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Profits at America\u2019s biggest companies grew 6.2 percent, driven largely by technology firms.\u2022 Railroad companies are on notice. Elon Musk is coming for them.\u2022 Stitch Fix is the only tech company led by a woman to go public this year.\u2022 21st Century Fox is courting several interested buyers. But the Justice Department may not let a big media marriage happen. That is one of the many debated questions. Proponents of the Republicans\u2019 plans argue that companies will invest the money. Opponents counter that firms will return the cash to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends.\u201cWhen all variables are measured properly, it seems major companies are paying out to shareholders about 22 percent of their net income. It\u2019s therefore unlikely that new profit, as might follow from lower corporate tax rates, will simply be drained out of the corporation.\u201cMore generally, sending money back to investors doesn\u2019t have to mean no new investment. What if those investors take the money and put it in a venture capital fund or invest it in some other manner? The whole point of capital markets is to recycle resources into the most profitable new opportunities, and that may or may not involve the companies that initially earned those profits.\u201dWith 95 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported third-quarter results, earnings are on pace to grow 6.2 percent from a year earlier, according to FactSet. That\u2019s up from the 3.1 percent growth rate expected at the end of period.Technology companies drove much of the growth. The sector reported a 19.7 percent increase in earnings and was the biggest contributor to earnings growth rate. If the tech sector was excluded, the overall growth rate would fall to 2.8 percent from 6.2 percent.Here are some more takeaways from earnings season:\u2022 Profits at companies that generate more that 50 percent of their sales outside the United States, grew more than 13 percent in the third quarter. Earnings at firms that get a majority of their revenue from within the U.S., rose only 2.3 percent.That is a reversal of what many analysts expected at the beginning of 2017. A stronger American dollar, a pickup in the United State\u2019s economy, and the Trump administration\u2019s policies were expected to benefit companies with the greatest exposure to United States were expected to benefit more from the Trump administration\u2019s policies, and a stronger dollar. But the United States dollar remained weaker.\u2022 The energy sector reported the largest increase in earnings of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors at 135 percent. The increase is a reflection of how hard the roughly two year slide in oil prices had hit the industry.\u2022 74 percent of companies have reported profits above analysts expectations, above the five-year average of 69 percent.\u2022 Financial firms reported the biggest decline in profits, down 8.3 percent. That decline can largely be blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Insurance companies in the sector reported 63 percent decrease in profits.\u2022 90 percent of the companies in the S&P 500\u2019s technology sector exceeded analyst estimates.\u2014 Stephen GrocerA traditional diesel truck can be operated for $1.51 a mile; the Tesla Semi, he said, beats that with $1.26.But it gets better. Using convoys \u2014 Tesla Semis yoked together with connected Autopilot technology, operating like road-going trains, with one semi as the leader \u2014 Tesla\u2019s cost drops to $0.85 a mile.\u201cThis beats rail,\u201d Musk said.Warren Buffett, of course, has bet big on railroads. In November 2009, his Berkshire Hathaway bought Burlington Northern Santa Fe. It was, he said at the time, a bet on the United States economy as it rebounded from the financial crisis.The online retailer\u2019s shares opened at $16.90, up 13 percent in its first day of trading.The I.P.O. differs from the typical Silicon Valley start-up that hits the public markets. The company kept its valuation relatively low, and it has generated a profit two years in a row.In fact, only 4.2 percent of all I.P.O.s in the United States were led by woman from 2000 to 2015. That compares to 6.4 percent of Fortune 500 companies run by a woman.The reasons are well known: The internet and newer players like Netflix have upended the media and telecom landscapes. Size and scale seem more important than ever. It\u2019s the premise of the AT&T and Time Warner deal, which itself echoes Comcast buying NBCUniversal.More in media consolidationAcross the industry, digital-media companies are finding that lines of business that caught fire for them early on \u2014 like creating custom content for brands \u2014 are becoming harder to scale up. Meanwhile, with each passing year, Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. are tightening their grip on the online-ad market.Extra creditThe leak of 210,000 gallons in South Dakota came days before the Public Services Commission of Nebraska is to vote on a permit for the pipeline\u2019s bigger sibling, Keystone XL.After his election, President Trump issued an executive order to clear obstacles for the Keystone XL, but TransCanada still needed a permit from the independent, five-person Nebraska PSC. Concerns there have revolved around potential harm to the state\u2019s ecologically delicate Sandhills region and its vast Ogallala aquifer, prompting TransCanada to move the Nebraska segment further east.What else have people found in the tax overhaul?The goal is to hit the ground running in overhauling an agency that some Republicans have called corrupt and that GOP lawmakers widely blame for burdening lenders with unnecessary red tape. It could be months before Trump nominates a permanent C.F.P.B. director and the Senate confirms his selection.The $1 trillion investor is talking about selling all of its holdings in oil companies. That\u2019s likely to give the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, which is working on an I.P.O., some heartburn.\u201cThe Norwegian view is that oil has had a good run and will have a good run for a couple of decades but it\u2019s not the only future that is out there.\u201dChina knows that, as demand for oil declines in much of the developed world, ever more of Aramco\u2019s barrels must flow east anyway. So the idea it will buy a big slug of Aramco at anything more than a discounted price \u2014 without some sort of sweetener in terms of a low-priced oil supply contract anyway \u2014 is a stretch.It\u2019s made by Tesla, of course. And it\u2019s both battery-powered and almost entirely self-driving.\u201cThe point of doing this is to give a hard-core smackdown to gasoline cars,\u201d he said to a cheering crowd of more than 2,000 people. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco and back.\u201dThe online clothing seller priced its stock market debut at $15 a share, well below its expected range. Is that because while the company is profitable, Jeff Bezos could yet crush it?The challenge that Stitch Fix faces is one that has burdened other start-ups like the food delivery service Blue Apron and the social networking phenomenon Snapchat: incumbent giants that have the money and the hunger to crush upstart rivals.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On the Paris Stage, Plays Get Personal and Political", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cYou Will Not Have My Hate,\u201d through Dec. 10, is a bone-chilling monologue, but problematic as a dramatic proposition. The stage version was commissioned by a production company, 984 Productions, and director Benjamin Guillard admits in the program notes that he hesitated before signing on. His adaptation is as tasteful and discreet as can be, but practically disappears under the weight of Mr. Leiris\u2019s story.The unassuming sets, by Jean Haas, consist of gauze curtains, seven scattered chairs and some origami models. A pianist, Lucr\u00e8ce Sassella, appears in silhouette behind a scrim, and provides delicate interludes (composed by Antoine Sahler). The rest of the 80-minute production rests squarely on the shoulders of Rapha\u00ebl Personnaz, the experienced stage and screen actor who delivers the text, alone.Ultimately, however, Mr. Leiris\u2019s terse chronological retelling of the days and weeks that followed the attack speaks for itself better than theater can. Of his lack of resentment, he writes: \u201cYou don\u2019t wipe tears on the sleeves of anger.\u201d Said aloud, the words felt heavy with the kind of fresh pain that even the finest actor can\u2019t quite replicate.The line between real and fictional anguish disappears in \u201cC\u2019est la vie\u201d (\u201cThat\u2019s Life\u201d), the second of three productions the director Mohamed El Khatib is presenting in Paris this fall. It deals with bereavement, too, albeit unmoored from the public attention a national tragedy commands. Its two actors, Fanny Catel and Daniel Kenigsberg, have both lost a child: Ms. Catel\u2019s daughter Jos\u00e9phine died at age 5 of complications from Zellweger syndrome, a rare genetic disease, while Mr. Kenigsberg\u2019s 25-year-old son Sam committed suicide in 2014.Like \u201cYou Will Not Have My Hate,\u201d \u201cC\u2019est la vie\u201d attempts to make theater out of private tragedy. And like the other play, it sticks to its protagonists\u2019 stories. At various points, Ms. Catel and Mr. Kenigsberg talk about their children\u2019s deaths in prerecorded videos to avoid reliving the experience; they watch their testimony with the audience.The audience is repeatedly asked to refer to a booklet provided at the start of the performance in addition to the playbill, which includes email exchanges between Mr. El Khatib, Ms. Catel and Mr. Kenigsberg about the production, as well as family trees and a double page devoted to \u201cfact-checking.\u201d The latter records Mr. Kenigsberg\u2019s objections to the way Mr. El Khatib shaped his story during the creation process, which suggests \u201cC\u2019est la vie\u201d took some liberties with the truth.Was the duo acting after all? Were we witnessing a form of catharsis, or merely a staged form of confessional writing? When the bereaved parents didn\u2019t return for curtain calls, the relief was palpable: Catharsis and confession are both admirable, as are Ms. Catel and Mr. Kenigsberg, but much of what they shared seemed ultimately to belong to the private sphere.The episodic structure the Chiens favor, with an independent story in every scene, remains, and a group of longtime members, among them the superlative C\u00e9line Fuhrer and Maxence Tual, continue to set a high bar. On the other hand, some of the collective\u2019s most recognizable faces (Thomas Scimeca, Anne-Elodie Sorlin) have been replaced for the occasion by new performers \u2014 including, for the first time, nonwhite actors, for a production that examines questions of racism in France.Making the audience uncomfortable is part of the Chiens\u2019 playbook, and much of \u201cJusque dans vos bras,\u201d through Dec. 2, is a wry exercise in privilege-checking. A ringmaster of sorts opened the performance by thanking the audience for \u201cslumming it in this neighborhood,\u201d namely La Chapelle, a neighborhood near the busy Gare du Nord train station with a significant migrant population. In another scene, some of the cast climbed into a boat and broke the fourth wall, asking the audience to intervene and rescue them by pulling a rope: An awkward moment of silence ensued before someone stood up to help.Les Chiens de Navarre\u2019s comic timing is often delectably cruel: The actors took turns embodying the kind of narrow-mindedness that poses as common sense, and perhaps the audience recognized these attitudes in themselves. \u201cI can\u2019t be racist,\u201d Mr. Tual announced at one point. \u201cI spend New Year\u2019s Eve in Marrakesh!\u201d From the idea of \u201cspeaking Muslim\u201d to urban myths about nannies of African descent, the dialogue was horrifyingly, hilariously politically incorrect, and peppered with pauses that allowed its fallacies to resonate.Some scenes proved less effective \u2014 sketches featuring Joan of Arc and Marie-Antoinette didn\u2019t feel as urgent \u2014 but \u201cJusque dans vos bras\u201d is razor-sharp when it excoriates everyday bigotry. In France especially, petty instincts butt heads with the lofty ideals of democracy and human rights that the nation defines itself by. The mirror the Chiens de Navarre hold up is all too faithful: As the theater audience stepped out into the neglected neighborhood of La Chapelle, the gap between them and the clusters of street peddlers across the street was plain to see.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Plans Net Neutrality Repeal in a Victory for Telecoms", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Communications Commission released a plan on Tuesday to dismantle landmark regulations that ensure equal access to the internet, clearing the way for internet service companies to charge users more to see certain content and to curb access to some websites.The proposal, made by the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, is a sweeping repeal of rules put in place by the Obama administration. The rules prohibit high-speed internet service providers, or I.S.P.s, from stopping or slowing down the delivery of websites. They also prevent the companies from charging customers extra fees for high-quality streaming and other services.The announcement set off a fight over free speech and the control of the internet, pitting telecom titans like AT&T and Verizon against internet giants like Google and Amazon. The internet companies warned that rolling back the rules could make the telecom companies powerful gatekeepers to information and entertainment. The telecom companies say that the existing rules prevent them from offering customers a wider selection of services at higher and lower price points.\u201cUnder my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,\u201d Mr. Pai said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that\u2019s best for them.\u201dMr. Pai, a Republican who has pursued an aggressive deregulation agenda, was widely expected to have his plan approved during a meeting on Dec. 14. The two other Republicans on the commission generally vote with Mr. Pai, giving them a majority over the two Democrats.Telecom and internet companies are expected to lobby hard in Washington \u2014 and directly to the public \u2014 as they did when the current rules were adopted.Some internet companies were expected to put up a fight to prevent the proposal from taking hold. The Internet Association, an industry group, joined a legal effort in 2015 to protect the existing rules. The agency has already received 20 million public comments, many of them in opposition of changing the rules, since Mr. Pai announced the broad outlines of his thinking early this year.The big companies that provide internet access to phones and computers have fought for years against broadband regulations. Under the new plan, broadband providers will be able to block access, slow down or speed up service for its business partners in some cases \u2014 as long as they notify customers.\u201cThis action will return broadband in the U.S. to a regulatory regime that emphasizes private investment and innovation over lumbering government intervention,\u201d said Joan Marsh, a vice president at AT&T.\u201cWe are disappointed that the proposal announced today by the F.C.C. fails to maintain the strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Erin Egan, a vice president at Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cWe will work with all stakeholders committed to this principle.\u201dSmall online companies believe the proposal would hurt innovation, because telecom companies could force them to pay more for the faster connections. Only the largest companies, they say, would be able to afford the expense of making sure their sites received preferred treatment. Companies like Etsy and Pinterest, for example, credit their start to the promise of free and open access on the internet.And consumers, the online companies say, may see their costs go up if, for example, they want high-quality access to popular websites like Netflix, a company that depends on fast connections for its streaming videos. Netflix said on Tuesday that it opposed Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal.The action \u201crepresents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Google, Facebook, Amazon and other tech companies.Mr. Pai said the current rules had been adopted to stop only theoretical harm. He said the rules limit consumer choice because telecom companies cannot offer different tiers of service, for example. As a result, he said, internet service companies cannot experiment with new business models that could help them compete with online businesses like Netflix, Google and Facebook.\u201cIt\u2019s depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation,\u201d Mr. Pai said Tuesday.Comcast, one of the country\u2019s biggest broadband companies, said it would not slow websites that contain legally permitted material.\u201cWe do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content \u2014 and we will be transparent with our customers about these policies,\u201d the company said.In a call with reporters, F.C.C. officials said the blocking and slowing of some content could be seen as anticompetitive. Those practices, they said, would be policed by the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department.Mr. Pai, who was appointed chairman by President Trump in January, has eliminated numerous regulations during his first year.The agency has stripped down rules governing television broadcasters, newspapers and telecom companies that were meant to protect the public interest. On Tuesday, in addition to the net neutrality rollback, Mr. Pai announced a plan to eliminate a rule limiting any corporation from controlling broadcasts that can reach more than 39 percent of American homes.The fight over net neutrality could end up being one of his biggest and most fraught decisions. For more than a decade, the agency has struggled with how to regulate internet service, leading to extended legal battles. The rules adopted under Mr. Wheeler were upheld in 2016 by a federal appeals court in Washington.The proposal released on Tuesday will probably make its way to court as well. And companies like Google and Facebook are expected to push the public to speak out against the plan. They coordinated a huge online protest against the possible changes in July.Some of the lobbying could take place in Congress, even though it may change little because Republicans control both houses. Nevertheless, Democrats have vowed to try to reconstruct the strict rules adopted by the F.C.C. in 2015.The next three weeks promise to hold intense lobbying from both sides, but that might not be the end of it. The regulation of internet providers has already swung once on a change in the Oval Office.\u201cAs good as the F.C.C.\u2019s action is for I.S.P.s, it only assures nonregulation of broadband through 2020,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the research firm Cowen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Trump Helped Liberate U.C.L.A. \u2018Knuckleheads\u2019 From China", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey learned that three American college basketball players \u2014 representing a storied sports program visiting China for an early-season game sponsored by one of China\u2019s largest companies \u2014 had been arrested on Nov. 8, accused of stealing designer sunglasses at a high-end shopping mall.The alleged offense was hardly life or death. But what had begun as a simple accusation of celebrity shoplifting threatened to escalate into a full-blown international incident just as Mr. Trump arrived in China on a 12-day mission through Asia, his first foreign trip to the region.\u201cThese are law and order guys; they have pretty swift justice,\u201d John Kelly, the president\u2019s chief of staff, said of the Chinese authorities in a telephone interview later. \u201cAn awful lot of American kids don\u2019t realize that the kinds of things that in United States society we tolerate with a slap on the wrist, a lot of countries they take very seriously.\u201dIn addition to Mr. Trump, the weeklong diplomatic drama involved the players themselves, who remained detained at their hotel in the provincial city of Hangzhou for most of the week; U.C.L.A., an elite American university with an international reputation; and the Chinese retail giant Alibaba, which sponsored the team\u2019s visit.In other cases, detained Americans have become geopolitical pawns, often trapped in a kind of legal limbo for months or years.And in a few instances, the outcome has been horrific, as in the case of Otto Warmbier, an American student in North Korea who was tortured and later died after being detained on charges that he tried to steal a poster from his hotel.But just as concern deepened about the fate of the three young athletes in China, their detention abruptly ended, aided, it seems, by Mr. Trump\u2019s direct intervention with the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. On Tuesday, the three players, including the star freshman LiAngelo Ball, the brother of the N.B.A. rookie Lonzo Ball, were allowed to leave their hotel and board a flight back to California.\u201cThe three U.C.L.A. men\u2019s basketball student-athletes involved in the incident with authorities in Hangzhou, China, are on a flight back home to Los Angeles,\u201d the Pacific-12, the athletics conference to which the university belongs, said in a statement, adding that \u201cthe matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of the Chinese authorities.\u201d\u201cWe want to thank the president, the White House and the U.S. State Department for their efforts towards resolution,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Kelly, who arrived back in the United States with Mr. Trump Tuesday night aboard Air Force One, provided details about the president\u2019s diplomatic outreach on behalf of the U.C.L.A. players.\u201cOur president said to Xi, \u2018Do you know anything about these knuckleheads that got caught allegedly stealing?\u2019\u201d Mr. Kelly said. Unaware of the episode, the Chinese president dispatched an aide to get more information. \u201cThe president was saying, \u2018It\u2019s not too serious. We\u2019d love to see this taken care of in an expeditious way,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kelly added.The three players had been accused of shoplifting from a Louis Vuitton store next to their hotel in Hangzhou, in eastern China, where they were preparing to play in a tournament. (Playing without the three freshmen, U.C.L.A. defeated Georgia Tech, 63-60, in Shanghai on Friday.)Mr. Kelly said Mr. Trump\u2019s intervention, as well as diplomatic efforts by State Department diplomats, led to the reduction of the charges to the equivalent of misdemeanors as well as the release of the three players to their hotel, where they were placed under temporary house arrest. It was there that Mr. Kelly talked to Chris Carlson, an associate athletic director at U.C.L.A., and to the players on the phone the next day.\u201cTo say the least, they were very apologetic,\u201d said Mr. Kelly, who pointedly did not ask the student-athletes whether they had, in fact, attempted to steal the merchandise they were accused of taking. \u201cThey were just profuse in their apologies for embarrassing the country and embarrassing the team.\u201dMr. Kelly told the players that Mr. Trump had intervened on their behalf and that he was \u201cvery optimistic that this would be taken care of in short order.\u201dIn China, where the justice system has a very high conviction rate, theft can bring punishment ranging from a few days to years in prison. Mr. Kelly said that had the players been charged with the equivalent of felonies \u2014 because of the high cost of the merchandise \u2014 they could have received prison sentences of five to 10 years.\u201cI bet they learned a lesson in their lives,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump was uncharacteristically quiet about the players and their situation until his overseas trip was winding down. He did not tweet about the case as the players sat trapped in their rooms. American officials did not put out any statements about the situation.But once he was headed home, Mr. Trump provided the first indications that the actions of the three young men had prompted a conversation at the highest of levels.\u201cI will tell you, when I heard about it two days ago, I had a great conversation with President Xi,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters during a brief conversation Tuesday before the students were formally allowed to leave their hotel. \u201cHe was terrific, and they\u2019re working on it right now. And hopefully everything is going to work out.\u201dMr. Trump called the alleged actions of the basketball players \u201cunfortunate,\u201d and grimly noted the toughness of the Chinese judicial system. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re talking about very long prison sentences,\u201d the president told reporters. \u201cThey do not play games.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been terrific,\u201d the president said. \u201cPresident Xi has been terrific on that subject.\u201dThe warm presidential relationship appeared to pay off with the release of Ball, a freshman guard; and Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, both freshman forwards. Mr. Trump emphasized that it was a \u201cvery, very rough situation, with what happened to them.\u201dThe arrests of the three young men could have derailed efforts to bridge the cultural divide. Hours before their release, Mr. Trump told reporters that the incident \u201cwas not something that should have happened.\u201dBut even then the president seemed to know something positive might be in the works. Asked if he expected to see the basketball players coming home soon, he answered: \u201cI hope so. I hope so.\u201dJust hours later, they were on a plane, too.Mark Landler reported from Manila, and Michael D. Shear from Washington. Victor Mather contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Pass Another Milestone, as Investors Remain Fearless", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the longest stock-market booms in history continued its gravity-defying ascent Thursday, with investors cheering the prospect of deep corporate tax cuts and the rollback of government regulations under President Trump.The Dow Jones industrial average eclipsed yet another milestone, closing Thursday above 24,000 for the first time. And the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index logged its 13th straight month of gains, the longest such streak in history.Stock markets have been going up, more or less without interruption, since March 2009, the end of the acute phase of the global financial crisis. This eight-and-a-half-year bull market is now the second-longest in history, behind only the rally that lasted from 1987 until 2000.Investors are embracing Mr. Trump\u2019s pro-corporate presidency, marked by the promise of lower taxes, the installation of former industry executives in key government agencies, and the repeal or relaxation of rules and regulations that have made it hard for some big businesses to expand without fear of interference from Washington.Indeed, the view is taking hold that Mr. Trump, in so aggressively promoting policies aimed to stoke the economy and financial markets, has unleashed animal spirits \u2014 largely absent under President Barack Obama \u2014 that are now reflected in ever rising consumer confidence indicators and a willingness to embrace risk in the stock market.\u201cIt comes down to psychology, and the psychology today is that everything is awesome,\u201d said Charlie Bilello, a stock market historian at Pension Partners. \u201cJobs have grown for 85 straight months, you have growth in corporate earnings, and you have tax cuts.\u201dMore than anything, enthusiasm about life being more pleasant for corporate America is propelling stocks. This week, investors were thrilled by the signs that a normally dysfunctional Washington is coalescing around a tax-cut package that would go straight to the bottom line of businesses and their owners.Of course, there is no guarantee the tax-cut package will become law. That is a potential tripwire for markets.\u201cIf the tax reform doesn\u2019t get done, I think there will be a pretty sharp correction,\u201d said Bruce Van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, one of the largest banking companies in the northeastern United States.Mr. Van Saun said stock markets could plunge as much as 15 percent if the tax cut was derailed in Congress. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite pivotal right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe businessperson has an expectation that this will get done.\u201dThese milestones, of course, are arbitrary. Passing a round number in a particular index isn\u2019t itself significant.But the ease with which the barrier was cleared highlights the extent to which investors are willing to look past geopolitical uncertainty and pricey stock valuations and bet that the market will keep going up.\u201cPeople are assuming this is normal \u2014 but it is not,\u201d Mr. Bilello said. \u201cThe relationship between risk and reward has broken down.\u201dIs this a bubble that\u2019s about to pop? Investment experts are divided.Skeptics point to the fact that many stocks, especially in the technology sector, are at historically high levels. Investors, they note, are relying on debt to amplify their returns. And a tulip-style mania has sent the price of the digital currency Bitcoin soaring.But even more investors are bullish. Sure, valuations are high, but in contrast to 2000, when Silicon Valley was littered with companies without business models, today\u2019s tech behemoths \u2014 including Facebook and Amazon \u2014 are fundamentally sound. And a round of tax cuts could further fatten corporate profits. As for Bitcoin, if it crashes there is no direct reason it should necessarily drag down stocks.Ed Yardeni, an independent stock market strategist, has identified 58 of these small market panics since 2009. This year, he has not seen a single one.\u201cThis is starting to feel like a melt-up,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said, describing a feverish state of a bull market when investors discard all fears. \u201cThe market has climbed a wall of worry, but now it seems as if there is nothing to worry about.\u201dThat, Mr. Yardeni said, is itself something to worry about, because investors are throwing caution to the wind.According to Mr. Bilello, the stock analyst, a typical year will include three or four stock market corrections. In 2017, there have been none. The worst swoon this year was a 3.3 percent fall between March 2 and April 19.Such a relentless \u2014 and smooth \u2014 rise in stocks is very unusual.Several unprecedented factors might be helping the rally, analysts say. For the first time ever, an American president is actively promoting a stock market surge. Mr. Trump has tweeted often about the stock market, including eight times this week alone.A president\u2019s boasting about the market doesn\u2019t mean it should keep going up. But at these high levels, psychology becomes a critical factor that can move stocks higher.That could mean your brother-in-law praising his portfolio at a cocktail party \u2014 or the president of the United States speaking more broadly to his 43 million followers on Twitter.It doesn\u2019t hurt that there has never been a time when the global economy has been growing so strongly while central banks kept interest rates so low.Traditionally, bull markets come to an end when, after a sustained period of growth, inflation forces central banks to raise rates.Now, with inflation stagnant and the lingering anxieties of the 2008 financial crisis fading, investors are not ready to contemplate the end of the party.For example, the latest missile scare from North Korea, after so many previous flare-ups, barely caused investors to bat an eyelid.\u201cI used to call my clients fully invested bears,\u201d said Mr. Yardeni, the investment strategist. \u201cNow they are giddy bulls \u2014 how could they not be?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Administration\u2019s Incoherent Stance on Competition", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPeter Thiel, Facebook\u2019s first outside investor, once wrote: \u201cCompetition is for losers. If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly.\u201d Executives at Facebook, Google and Amazon seem to have taken his blunt advice.If only the Trump administration could be so clear when it comes to its stance on competition. Instead, it has sent a schizophrenic message, which means the few remaining companies with a chance to rival big tech have no way of knowing where the administration stands or what values it will enforce.The incoherence of these conflicting positions on competition is staggering, but this kind of cognitive dissonance is not unique. Don\u2019t forget that the Obama administration \u2014 at the behest of Amazon, which controlled almost 80 percent of the online book market \u2014 brought an antitrust suit alleging Apple and five publishers colluded on pricing for digital books. That administration did not have a consistent view of media monopoly power that is enforced equally on all parties, and neither does the current one.For instance, internet service providers operate under a totally different set of privacy regulations than the online service providers (like Google and Facebook) that dominate the online advertising market. According to Morgan Stanley, Google and Facebook took an astonishing 85 percent of all new online ad revenue last year. And yet Google spends millions lobbying Congress to prevent any rivals from entering its unique surveillance capitalism business. Essentially, the government is giving a pass to the largest media advertising firms that have no restrictions on consumer privacy, while suing to block potential rival services that operate under strict privacy restrictions.Of course, being buried deep in Google\u2019s search results or being forced to pay Google for prominent placement hurts smaller firms. This is arguably no less harmful to a business than being forced to pay Verizon for good video quality for its streaming site \u2014 the fate that many content producers will meet if net neutrality rules are rolled back under the plan the F.C.C. has hinted at. It is what economists call \u201crent seeking,\u201d and it is a cancer on any open media system in any context, but the Trump administration doesn\u2019t treat it the same in all contexts.Mr. Trump is nothing if not sensitive to a populist uprising, and the net neutrality decision will probably be opposed on both the left and right. It could be that during the F.C.C.\u2019s comment period, the resistance to overturning net neutrality may be too strong and the ruling will be withdrawn.But that leaves the larger questions unanswered. What exactly would a consistent antitrust policy for the media sector look like? Is it possible to reconcile the conflicting signals from the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice?The answer is that regulators must realize where the real market power lies and use this as the basis for their decisions about competition. Time Warner\u2019s market capitalization is $70 billion. Google is worth 10 times as much, at $723 billion. Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner\u2019s largest advertising subsidiary, brought in $1.2 billion in ad revenue in the last quarter, while Google reported $22.5 billion in ad revenue in the same period. It should be noted that AT&T has almost no appreciable ad revenue. So, if there is to be a coherent approach to competition, the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates Google and Facebook, and the F.C.C., which regulates AT&T, must find common ground on the regulation of ad-supported content networks.For the Trump administration to try to block the merger of two relatively small media players while letting Google operate freely with no privacy restrictions is to be fighting the last war. The notion that television is the major media power in America ignores reality. It may be that the assistant attorney general for antitrust, Makan Delrahim, has a decent case that internet service providers and content providers need some sort of separation. But if that is true, then the same rules on neutrality and consumer privacy need to apply to companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 and the F.C.C. should keep net neutrality rules in place.The administration can\u2019t have it both ways.Jonathan Taplin is the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Senators Want Answers on AT&T Negotiations", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood afternoon. Is the Justice Department under President Trump more willing to block mergers than previously thought? It may depend on the kind of transactions we\u2019re talking about. A group of senators sent a letter to the D.O.J. demanding answers as to whether President Trump is influencing the department\u2019s negotiations with AT&T. The latest developments in the tax overhaul remain on our minds, especially since the Senate is proposing delaying a cut to the corporate rate until 2019. More on all that in a moment.The senators continued:\u201cThese outstanding questions are especially concerning in light of yesterday\u2019s news reports. Multiple news sources have reported that the Department told the parties that they would need to divest CNN as a condition of completing the merger\u2026The President\u2019s views about the content of CNN\u2019s press coverage have no place in antitrust law enforcement. Should the Antitrust Division determine that AT&T\u2019s acquisition of CNN \u2013 as well as other Time Warner properties \u2013 raises antitrust concerns, Department enforcement action may be warranted. But political considerations based on the content of CNN\u2019s news coverage should never impact the Department\u2019s decision-making. Political interference in antitrust law enforcement is unacceptable. We hope that you share our views about the importance of maintaining the professionalism and independence of the antitrust enforcement agencies.\u201d\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinMany, many deal makers believed that a Trump presidency would be good for mergers within the media and telecom industries. Companies felt the need to get bigger, thanks to ever-increasing competition \u2014 and much of the inspiration came from AT&T\u2019s planned $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner. That was before this week.Think about how many deals are in the works, or that analysts say should be in the works. Sinclair is in the process of buying Tribune. Disney briefly held talks about buying most of 21st Century Fox. Sprint and T-Mobile are both single and potentially ready to mingle. And so on.Are Fox and Sinclair exempt? President Trump is a self-professed fan of all things Fox and personally close to Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch. We wonder if Fox tried to buy Time Warner again as they tried in 2014, could that deal actually be approved. Sinclair\u2019s news organization has also been quite supportive of President Trump. Does that facilitate a positive outcome to Sinclair\u2019s pending Tribune acquisition?The recent announcements about moderate Islam, the pervasive arrests, and the illusory hypermodern economic projects frame him as a ruthless modernizer, who is struggling to achieve too many things in too little time. But his motive is more about the consolidation of power than about corruption.Don\u2019t count on staying at the Ritz-Carlton anytime soonIn more Saudi newsBut some Republicans quietly say the loss of a few seats might be the price they have to pay for success to satisfy other constituents and business supporters hungry for a tax break.More tax notes____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London.____________________________Mr. Cohn also committed to staying in the administration, even though he was passed over for Federal Reserve chairman.Thirteen newsmakers joined us at the DealBook conference on Thursday, and many made news. Here\u2019s what they said:Mr. Stephenson made that clear. But also emerging is an apparent attempt to depoliticize an increasingly heated dispute with the Justice Department: The A&T chief told Andrew that the Trump administration had never asked him to sell CNN, and that he didn\u2019t believe there was a \u201cTrump factor\u201d in the talks.That raises questions about what the Justice Department is really seeking. Is it, as some Trump critics suggest, an attack on a news outlet that the president has openly criticized? Or is it an attempt to break up a deal that has become a lightning rod for concerns about a rapidly consolidating media industry, perhaps rooted in the administration\u2019s populist tendencies?More food for thoughtMore accusations emerged yesterdayNot everyone is convinced that Wall Street firms will take over China, however, since state-run banks will remain powerful.\u201cGod only knows what it\u2019s doing to our children\u2019s brains.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They said in a statement on Tuesday that the cadet candidate had admitted to writing the slurs and was no longer enrolled at the school.\u201cWe can confirm that one of the cadet candidates who was allegedly targeted by racist remarks written outside of their dorm room was actually responsible for the act,\u201d the academy said. \u201cThe individual admitted responsibility and this was validated by the investigation.\u201dGeneral Silveria said Tuesday that he stood by the underlying message of his speech, which invoked some of the nation\u2019s most divisive racial events.The academy said it would provide no further details on the matter, even though there may be \u201cadditional information already in the public space.\u201dThe episode over the racist graffiti was propelled into national attention weeks after white supremacists rallied in Charlottesville, Va., and amid protests by N.F.L. players over racial inequality, events that General Silveria discussed in his speech.As news spread online that a black student had written the slurs, some called on General Silveria to directly address the episode as a hate crime hoax.The episode renewed concerns that falsely reported hate crimes could make it more difficult for people with legitimate grievances to be taken seriously, particularly in a time when the reports of hate crimes are highly politicized.\u201cAny false reports of bias incidents are seized on by those who want to create the impression that no hate crime reporting is legitimate,\u201d said Ibrahim Hooper, the spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cWe have seen an unprecedented spike in the number of hate- and bias-related incidents targeting American Muslims and others across the board.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Holding Hands, Drinking Wine and Other Ways to Go to Jail in Dubai", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 A Scottish electrician named Jamie Harron, visiting Dubai as a tourist, was sentenced to three months in jail for touching a man in a bar.But a legal system based on a hard-line interpretation of Shariah law often lands foreigners in jail for offenses that few Westerners would dream were even crimes.Recent examples cited by lawyers include holding hands in public; posting praise on Facebook for a charity opposed to fox hunting; drinking alcohol without a license; and sharing a hotel room with a person of the opposite sex (other than one\u2019s spouse).Mostly, the Dubai authorities look the other way when it comes to such behavior by foreigners \u2014 until they don\u2019t. Hotels do not ask couples for their marriage licenses. Dubai has a lively night life, with numerous gay bars and nightclubs where East European prostitutes openly solicit customers.Yet cohabitation is a crime, homosexuality is subject to the death penalty (though it is rarely imposed) and prostitution can be punished with lashes and even worse.Even victims of violent crimes can be accused of morality offenses: Gay people who report assaults have been jailed along with their attackers, and women who report being raped can be imprisoned for adultery if they do not have four male witnesses to support their story.Radha Stirling, a British lawyer, says she has represented hundreds of Westerners who have been jailed in Dubai for behavior that is usually permitted there.Two recent cases, both handled by Ms. Stirling, have aroused widespread ire in Britain, which has more nationals living in Dubai than any other Western country.Mr. Mukadam, a computer consultant, had been in a rental car, so it took the police a while to trace him. But six months later, in September, he was arrested at the airport upon returning to Dubai. He is now free on bail, without his passport, awaiting trial.He could face six months in jail if convicted of making the \u201cobscene gesture.\u201d Mr. Mukadam said he had often visited Dubai with his wife and that he liked the city, particularly its variety of halal food, but does not plan to return.\u201cNo chance I\u2019m coming back here again,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t set foot here again, not the way I\u2019ve been treated.\u201dEmiratis are mostly unapologetic about their country\u2019s contradictions.Most cases that ensnare unwary foreigners involve morality offenses. It is against the law to drink without a license, for instance, but foreigners can only get one if they are residents. So any tourist who is drinking is doing so illegally, even in a licensed bar. Couples cannot share a room together if they are not married, even in their homes.Some Emiratis acknowledge that their laws have not kept pace with a rapidly changing society.\u201cIt is unreasonable to expect a country to warn each and every visitor about its complete set of rules and regulations in place,\u201d Essam Tamimi, a Dubai lawyer, said in an email. \u201cIn a short period of time, Dubai has greatly developed and has become one of the world\u2019s most diverse melting pots. That being said, laws in general are made to accommodate the society\u2019s needs and the U.A.E., like most other countries, still has some changes to make.\u201dDubai officials did not respond to requests for comment for this article.Mr. Haigh had gotten into a business dispute with a Dubai bank, GFH Capital, that owned a stake in the team. He said he was tricked into coming to Dubai to resolve their differences, then jailed on arrival for breach of trust and held for several months without being allowed to see a lawyer.\u201cNinety percent of the population are breaking the law 90 percent of the time and no one does anything against them until they upset the wrong person and they get arrested,\u201d Mr. Haigh said of Dubai.Foreign residents and tourists encounter similar problems throughout the Emirates \u2014 Mr. Pate\u2019s company was based in Abu Dhabi \u2014 but they are more common in Dubai because more Westerners live and visit there.Other offenses that few foreigners realize can lead to jail time include passing a bad check, even accidentally; failing to pay a credit-card bill on time; taking a photograph of someone without his or her permission; and touching someone.He was sentenced to three months in jail, although he was allowed to leave the country after the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, nullified the court\u2019s ruling. Heavy publicity has often helped resolve such cases, even when legally they looked hopeless.\u201cThe U.A.E. government is just a huge public relations entity,\u201d Ms. Stirling said. \u201cIf they think a case is going to harm them, the government will speak to the police and get the charges dropped.\u201dFollow Rod Nordland on Twitter: @rodnordlandAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Search of Silence ", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byErling Kagge, a 54-year-old Norwegian explorer, author and publisher, was sitting one morning last month in the private gardens at the Church of St. Luke in the Fields, a green oasis of relative quiet in the West Village of Manhattan.\u201cYou never find a place that is total silence,\u201d Mr. Kagge said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking, and I have not found it.\u201d\u201cWhen you start, you have all the noise in your head,\u201d Mr. Kagge said, adding that by his journey\u2019s end, \u201cYou feel your brain is wider than the sky. You\u2019re a guy being part of this bigness, this greatness. To be alone and experience the silence feels very safe, very meaningful.\u201dMuch of the modern-day \u201cnoise\u201d that people wish to escape comes not from loud sounds or grating talk (though there are plenty of both), but from endless distractions. Mr. Kagge was inspired to write the book because, he said, he realized that his three daughters, who range in age from 15 to 21, have grown up with iPhones essentially attached to their bodies.\u201cMy daughters didn\u2019t know what silence was. There\u2019s always something happening, always temptations,\u201d Mr. Kagge said. He frets about the long-term effects of such overstimulation. \u201cSilence is not a trend,\u201d he said. \u201cSilence is something people have needed for thousands of years.\u201dHe had traveled from his home in Oslo to New York to take on a challenge that, in its own way, was no less difficult than walking to the South Pole: finding silence in the city.He\u2019d gotten off to a noisy start the day before when he\u2019d checked into his hotel and found an air-circulating unit churning outside his window. After waking in another room, he\u2019d walked down Eighth Avenue, only to be assaulted by the \u201cvisual noise\u201d of Manhattan in full morning rush. Now, even in an enclosed church garden, he couldn\u2019t escape the incessant grinding sound of workmen stripping paint from a building\u2019s fire escape one block south.But Mr. Kagge, who has strong features framed by a snowy beard, found the spot tranquil by comparison. \u201cAll these variations of green,\u201d he said, looking around. Mr. Kagge\u2019s own smartphone was tucked into his jeans pocket, where it would remain throughout the day, though he admits to general excessive checking of it, and consultation of Google. In his book, he quotes the 17th-century writer Blaise Pascal, who said, \u201cAll of humanity\u2019s problems stem from man\u2019s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not recommending people move into a monastery,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re social beings. But in the silence, you meet yourself.\u201dAn avid art collector, Mr. Kagge next thought to seek contemplative silence inside a museum. He decided against the Museum of Modern Art (\u201cMoMA is too successful\u201d) and instead settled on the less-visited Frick Collection, at Fifth Avenue and 70th Street. Heading uptown, he detoured to walk north along the High Line elevated park, hoping for a quiet aerie.At the High Line\u2019s West 30th Street and 10th Avenue exit, the decibel level reached peak cacophony. It was the heart of the Hudson Yards development project, right near a traffic-clogged entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. Car horns, jackhammers, rivet guns, workmen yelling, New Yorkers speed-walking to get somewhere \u2014 maybe the noisiest spot in the Western world.\u201cThis is pretty crazy,\u201d Mr. Kagge yelled.He quickened his pace, and farther uptown, when he entered Central Park, he stopped, smiled and said, \u201cFor the first time today, you can hear the wind.\u201dUPPER EAST SIDE HUSHMr. Kagge has experienced profound moments in nature. He told a story, one he tells in the book, about a sailing trip he took across the south Pacific Ocean, in 1986. He was on watch on deck, alone, after midnight, when he heard \u201ca sound that seemed like a long, deep breath,\u201d to the west of the boat. It was a surfacing whale, unseen but heard and felt in the darkness.\u201cIt made such a deep impression on me,\u201d Mr. Kagge said.Before going to the Frick, he wanted to stop by the Explorers Club, which is housed in a six-story mansion on East 70th Street. He was invited by its members to join after his headline-grabbing adventures \u2014 he has also skied to the North Pole and climbed Mount Everest, the so-called Third Pole \u2014 but rarely has a chance to visit. The club was empty of members at midday, and Mr. Kagge made his way upstairs, to a dark wood-paneled old room. There were no other people inside. There were no sounds of cars whirring by outside. There were no sounds at all. \u201cBut it\u2019s not fair,\u201d Mr. Kagge said, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s inside a private club.\u201dThe Frick, with its paintings by Rembrandt and other old masters, offered Mr. Kagge and the public a different kind of silence: the hushed reverence of museumgoers. After this there was a break: lunch at a crowded French bistro, and a trip to Dover Street Market, to get his daughters Supreme gear. No expectations there.When Mr. Kagge resumed the search for silence, he wanted to try a location in the boroughs outside Manhattan. A spot was suggested: Louis Valentino, Jr. Park and Pier, a little green space tucked along the waterfront in the Red Hook section Brooklyn.By the time Mr. Kagge got there, the news had broke that earlier that afternoon, a man had driven a truck through a crowd of people on a bike path in Lower Manhattan. Helicopters were hovering overhead in the distance. A police boat raced across the choppy water. The world seemed suddenly, scarily, noisy.And yet, at sunset, in the early evening chill, the park was deeply peaceful.Going out to the end of the pier, Mr. Kagge said, \u201cIf you walk 20 or 30 minutes in the city, you\u2019ll find a quiet place.\u201dA young man and woman were also on the pier talking in affectionate whispers. Mr. Kagge was silent for a long time, watching the sun set over the water.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to think silence is about turning your back on the world,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s opening up to the world, respecting more and loving life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Myanmar, Pope Francis Calls for Peace Without Saying \u2018Rohingya\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAYPYIDAW, Myanmar \u2014 Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has constantly used his pulpit to champion the downtrodden and draw attention to the misery of the powerless and the persecuted.\u201cI would like to express my full closeness to them,\u201d he said at the Vatican at the time, \u201cand let all of us ask the Lord to save them, and to raise up men and women of good will to help them, who shall give them their full rights.\u201dOn Tuesday, Pope Francis had a singular opportunity to be an advocate for the Rohingya as he stood next to Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader and in front of a hall full of military officials, prelates and diplomats in this ghostly fortress of a capital.\u201cThe future of Myanmar must be peace, a peace based on respect for the dignity and rights of each member of society, respect for each ethnic group and its identity,\u201d the pope said as he stood next to Myanmar\u2019s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose own reputation has suffered for failing to speak out against the killings. Francis said that respect for rule of law and the democratic order \u201cenables each individual and every group \u2014 none excluded \u2014 to offer its legitimate contribution to the common good.\u201d\u201cRohingya\u201d is a highly polarized term in Myanmar, and the pope\u2019s own advisers had warned him that using it during his visit could antagonize the military, embolden hard-line Buddhists and even make the situation worse for the Rohingya. What the pope said in private about their plight is not known.But critics worried that Francis\u2019 caution in public, while perhaps prudent, risked diminishing his reputation as the world\u2019s megaphone against injustice.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d said Lynn Kuok, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for East Asia Policy Studies, who had hoped the pope would acknowledge the Rohingya and their plight. Instead she called his speech \u201ctepid\u201d and added: \u201cWhen even the leader of the Catholic Church doesn\u2019t speak out, it really shows the desperate situation they are in.\u201dIt was a visit that even his supporters considered an unforced error as it potentially put him in a moral quandary not entirely unlike that of Pope Pius XII, whose reputation forever suffered for his calculation that speaking out against the genocide of Jews during World War II would risk the lives of Catholics.Francis is still wildly popular, and he is expected to meet with Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh later in the week. But here the diplomatic demands of the local politics outweighed any temptation the pope may have risked to directly denounce the treatment of the Muslim minority.More than 620,000 Rohingya have fled across the border to Bangladesh since August, when the military began a crackdown in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine State, in response to Rohingya militants\u2019 attacks on security posts.Myanmar has stripped the Rohingya of citizenship and does not consider them to be a distinct ethnic group. Instead, most of the majority-Buddhist population regards them as interlopers from Bangladesh.Because of this, the term Rohingya is essentially taboo. Cardinal Charles Maung Bo and others in the church had urged the pope not to use it during his trip, for fear that any appearance of taking the side of the Muslim minority could provoke a violent backlash against Catholics in the country, who number about 700,000.\u201cI have come, above all, to pray with the nation\u2019s small but fervent Catholic community,\u201d Francis said on Tuesday. \u201cTo confirm them in their faith, and to encourage them in their efforts to contribute to the good of the nation.\u201dThe Rohingya crisis has already done reputational damage to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was stripped of her Freedom of Oxford award for failing to denounce the military\u2019s crackdown.Speaking immediately before Francis, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi acknowledged that \u201cthe situation in the Rakhine has most strongly captured the attention of the world.\u201d She said that in the face of a breakdown of trust \u201cbetween different communities in Rakhine,\u201d she especially valued the support of friends who wished for the government\u2019s success.\u201cIt is the aim of our government to bring out the beauty of our diversity and to make it our strength, by protecting rights, fostering tolerance, ensuring security for all,\u201d she said.But Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won a landslide election in 2015, is also in an excruciatingly tight political spot. She has no authority over the military, which ruled the country outright for decades. Her defenders, including Cardinal Bo and others in the church, argue that she is powerless to stop the campaign against the Rohingya, and that for her to speak out against it would only weaken her, strengthen the military and jeopardize the country\u2019s fragile democratic gains. She conferred privately with the pope before their public speeches.In a Facebook post after Monday\u2019s meeting, the general denied that religious prejudice existed in Myanmar. \u201cHis speech is always the same,\u201d said Mariano Soe Naing, a spokesman for the Myanmar Catholic bishops conference.For that very reason, many humanitarian groups had hoped Pope Francis would say something very different. Instead, he spoke broadly about religious differences as a source of enrichment, tolerance and nation-building.\u201cThe religions can play a significant role in repairing the emotional, spiritual and psychological wounds of those who have suffered in the years of conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cDrawing on deeply held values, they can help to uproot the causes of conflict, build bridges of dialogue, seek justice and be a prophetic voice for all who suffer.\u201dSome diplomats thought it was for the best that the pope had not explicitly mentioned the Rohingya.\u201cThe problem is that with the press, maybe some human rights organizations, the expectations are very high,\u201d said Nikolay Listopadov, Russia\u2019s ambassador to Myanmar, after exiting the International Convention Center, where the speeches took place. \u201cThey usually expect some miracles. But even the pope can\u2019t just produce a miracle right now.\u201dThe pope emphasized similar themes earlier Tuesday at the archbishop\u2019s residence in Yangon, where he met for 40 minutes with Buddhist leaders, as well as Hindu, Jewish, Christian and Muslim representatives. He said that diversity was a source of strength and that uniformity eroded humanity.But that view is anathema to many Buddhists in Myanmar. Many see the Rohingya, who have lived in Myanmar for generations, as unassimilated Muslim separatists whose propagation poses a threat to Buddhist, and nationalist, identity.\u201cWe don\u2019t like them. We\u2019re angry,\u201d said Naing Win, a 19-year-old novice monk who was walking around a pagoda complex in Yangon on Monday afternoon.Nor does the view of Rohingya as, essentially, trespassers in Myanmar appear to be limited to hard-line Buddhists. Asked if any Rohingya had been present at the morning meeting in Yangon, Father Soe Naing, the spokesman for the Myanmar Catholic Bishops conference, explained that it was unlikely, as the Muslims who called themselves Rohingya were not allowed to move around the country.The designation Rohingya, he added, was \u201ca sudden creation\u201d that reflected a separatist movement in Rakhine State: \u201cFor us they are called Bengalis.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You control the tea\u2019s sweetness by deciding how much to disturb the depths.On the menu, this is called three-layer tea. Malaysians also know it as a teh C peng special: \u201cteh\u201d for tea, brewed with a touch of sugar and poured back and forth between pots from a great height, to make it froth; C for Carnation, the brand once synonymous with evaporated milk, the white at the middle; and \u201cpeng\u201d for ice.Is the version here as good as on the streets of Kuching, a city in Sarawak, a state on the island of Borneo in Malaysia, where three-layer tea was first poured? I don\u2019t know, but I drank it to the dregs.I tried to resist PappaRich. I was unsure of it, because it\u2019s part of a restaurant chain, founded in Malaysia more than a decade ago, with more than a hundred outlets around the Pacific Rim; because a friend in Singapore likened it to a fast-food joint; because the Flushing outpost, opened last year, is on the second floor of a blandly modern mall.But as dish after dish arrived (so many that the waiter brought an extra table), I gave in. Here was beef braised seemingly forever in coconut milk, beautifully slumped with all its knots undone, making a virtue of indolence; fish and shrimp paste spread inside crinkly rectangles of tofu skin and slipped into a bowl of curry laksa, the soup\u2019s surface flecked with melted fat; and fish heads mobbed by okra and eggplant in a curry so luxurious, I couldn\u2019t stop dragging strips of roti canai through it and watching them turn to gold.That roti canai alone: The dough is stretched by hand until tissue-thin, and then flipped, folded twice over and gently twirled into a circle. When an order comes in, it\u2019s dropped on the griddle and arrives still bristling, flaky and chewy at once. For dessert, it\u2019s sandwiched around kaya, a coconut-milk jam with the eggy richness of custard and the pale green tinge of pandan, whose elusive flavor is not quite vanilla, hazelnut or grass, and greater than them all.Soo Kwai, the head chef of PappaRich USA, oversees the recipes, and Wong Chee Seng runs the kitchen. They keep an eye on details, like the tangle of yellow egg noodles and skinny rice noodles in curry laksa, for a mix of slipperiness and give. Even a simple order of chicken rice is decadent, the grains steeped in chicken stock, lemongrass and butter. It made me wish that PappaRich knew of the American penchant for bottomless bowls.The dining room casts back to Malaysia\u2019s colonial past, with lattice screens and arched wall niches. Etched into round mirrors is the restaurant\u2019s logo, an unruffled gentleman beaming over a cup of coffee \u2014 a \u201crich pappa,\u201d explained the general manager, Kesh Dhami, in a joking inversion.On each table is a buzzer for calling a server, which I never needed, and a chit for writing down the numbers of desired dishes, a code the servers know by heart but which I had to hunt for through the tome of a menu, leafing through its magazine-like photo spreads.One item is missing: the chain\u2019s beloved steamed Hainan bread, presented with an unsettled \u201chalf-boiled\u201d egg that customers get to crack themselves at the table. But Mr. Dhami assured me that the bread is on its way, along with another PappaRich set to open in December in Edison, N.J., and more to come \u2014 until every American knows its name.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sight, Yet Elusive", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "Damon Winter is a staff photographer for The New York Times. He won a Pulitzer Prize in feature photography for his coverage of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.But no matter how restrictive the campaign, there are usually some opportunities to capture the small and revealing moments that occur in back rooms at rallies and during the grueling, cross-country trips as the candidates court voters. These, traditionally, have been vital elements of campaign coverage, allowing us to produce a richer, more nuanced account. In the Trump campaign, there have been almost none.Photographers covering his campaign went weeks without seeing Mr. Trump interact with supporters on the rope line after his rallies. In the final weeks of the campaign, we have often been ushered out before he has finished his speech. In September, Mr. Trump left the traveling press corps behind as he made his way to a rally in New Hampshire, and gloated about it as he took the stage without us there.Despite the restrictions, I try my best to convey the tone and tenor of the campaign and capture a sense of Mr. Trump\u2019s events, which can at times feel dark, both visually and in tone.At rallies, the press is routinely harassed by supporters and insulted by the candidate himself. I often hear racist and violent comments and see young children chanting, \u201cLock her up! Lock her up!\u201d \u2014 referring to Hillary Clinton \u2014 alongside their parents. Near Milwaukee, a man leaned over the metal barricade separating us and whispered to me that if Mrs. Clinton were there, they would \u201crip her to pieces.\u201dMr. Trump is a fascinating visual subject. He is instantly recognizable from almost any angle and any distance. His signature hair reflects more light than anything around him, making him stand out in any scene. This gives me latitude to be creative in how I cover him. He is also very expressive when he speaks, which can present a challenge: He makes grand gestures so often that they begin to lose any meaning or significance.For this reason, I often find myself drawn to his quieter moments. The first time Mr. Trump used a teleprompter, I photographed him staring directly through the words reflected in the transparent glass, straight into my lens. After months of criticizing his opponent for using one and getting himself into trouble with his off-the-cuff speeches, the candidate looked chagrined to rely on it.For all of the limits to our access on the trail, Mr. Trump agreed to sit for portraits with me on three occasions over the course of the campaign. During those sessions he was always cordial and mostly agreeable, but he had very firm ideas about how he wanted to be shown. My biggest challenge was getting past his standard repertoire of poses and the near-scowl that he seems to favor the most. At a shoot in his campaign headquarters, his staff members lent a hand and cheered him on as we tossed pounds of red and blue confetti over him.In one of the final frames, as the cheering stopped and he walked off the set through the last trickle of confetti, I saw Mr. Trump at a moment that captured a glimpse of what it feels like when the spotlight is gone and the party is over.I have found that the most telling portraits don\u2019t always have to show a person\u2019s face. A photo I took in Greensboro, N.C., showing Mr. Trump in front of a dimly lit American flag, with only a pointed finger and his iconic golden hair visible, is one of the most revealing portraits I have made of him \u2014 not just because of what is shown, but because of what is obscured.I was initially reluctant to cover another election, but I quickly realized that this year it was more important than ever to be out there with a vigilant, thoughtful and critical eye. As the restrictions on the press tightened, I felt it was my duty at every possible moment to subvert them, to find photographs that were honest and telling. Every situation, no matter how controlled, contrived or mundane, was an opportunity to make something real.I know that I can never explain the day\u2019s news the way our writers do, but what I can do is help the reader feel what it is like to be there and to make pictures that have meaning beyond the objects in the frame.My role is not to make the candidate look good or make the crowds look impressive. My job is to tell the story.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "The Paradise PapersThe tech giant has found a tax haven in the island of Jersey, leaving billions of dollars untouched by the United States, leaked documents reveal.Supported byTim Cook was angry.\u201cWe pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar,\u201d Mr. Cook declared at the hearing. \u201cWe don\u2019t depend on tax gimmicks,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe don\u2019t stash money on some Caribbean island.\u201dTrue enough. The island Apple would soon rely on was in the English Channel.Five months after Mr. Cook\u2019s testimony, Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the small island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income.Apple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.The previously undisclosed story of Apple\u2019s search for a new tax haven and its use of Jersey is among the findings emerging from a cache of secret corporate records from Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm that caters to businesses and the wealthy elite.The documents reveal how big law firms help clients weave their way through the gaps between different countries\u2019 tax rules. Appleby clients have transferred trademarks, patent rights and other valuable assets into offshore shell companies, avoiding billions of dollars in taxes. The rights to Nike\u2019s Swoosh trademark, Uber\u2019s taxi-hailing app, Allergan\u2019s Botox patents and Facebook\u2019s social media technology have all resided in shell companies that listed as their headquarters Appleby offices in Bermuda and Grand Cayman, the records show.\u201cU.S. multinational firms are the global grandmasters of tax avoidance schemes that deplete not just U.S. tax collection but the tax collection of most every large economy in the world,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a former corporate tax adviser to such companies who is now a law professor at the University of Southern California.Indeed, tax strategies like the ones used by Apple \u2014 as well as Amazon, Google, Starbucks and others \u2014 cost governments around the world as much as $240 billion a year in lost revenue, according to a 2015 estimate by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The disclosures come on the heels of last week\u2019s proposals by Republican lawmakers to provide several new tax benefits for multinational companies, including cutting the federal corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. President Trump has said that American businesses are getting a bad deal under current rules.But the documents show how major American companies find creative ways to avoid paying anything close to 35 percent.Apple, for example, pays taxes at a small fraction of that rate on its offshore profits, according to calculations by The Times based on the company\u2019s securities filings. Apple reports that nearly 70 percent of its worldwide profits are earned offshore.An Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, declined to answer most questions about the company\u2019s tax strategy. He did say that Apple had told regulators \u2014 in the United States and Ireland and at the European Commission \u2014 about the reorganization of its Irish subsidiaries. \u201cThe changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cAt Apple we follow the laws, and if the system changes we will comply. We strongly support efforts from the global community toward comprehensive international tax reform and a far simpler system.\u201dIn prepared statements, Allergan, Facebook, Nike and Uber said they complied with tax regulations around the world.Congressional Republicans are also seeking to impose a 10 percent tax on some of the profits that American businesses say are earned offshore \u2014 half the rate they are proposing for profits in the United States. The lawmakers have also proposed another break, permitting multinationals to bring home more than $2.6 trillion stowed offshore at sharply reduced tax rates. Both proposals, critics say, would only create additional incentives for businesses like Apple to shift more profits into island hideaways.Appleby is a member of the global network of lawyers, accountants and bankers who set up or manage offshore companies and accounts for clients who want to avoid taxes or keep their finances a secret from authorities, business partners or even spouses. The firm did not respond to questions from The Times about its work for Apple or other companies.Tax authorities have challenged several of the offshore structures maintained by Appleby and Estera, a spinoff of the law firm\u2019s corporate services business. Nike won a fight over back taxes with the Internal Revenue Service a year ago; a similar dispute between the I.R.S. and Facebook is continuing.European regulators are trying to force countries including Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to collect back taxes from big companies that relied on offshore arrangements. Apple is being pursued for $14.5 billion in back taxes after European regulators ruled that its old tax structure amounted to illegal state aid from the Irish government.Since the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens. Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions \u2014 mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2014 now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the world\u2019s population.Criticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.In May 2013, the Senate\u2019s investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apple\u2019s tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared \u201ctax residency\u201d nowhere in the world.Under Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is \u201cmanaged and controlled\u201d abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax. By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.At the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there. The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.\u201cApple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,\u201d then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.Ireland\u2019s finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, at first defended his country\u2019s policies: \u201cI do not want to be the whipping boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.\u201d Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies. Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.But by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.At that time, Apple had accumulated $111 billion in offshore cash, mostly in its Irish subsidiaries. Billions of dollars in new profits poured into them each year. Yet they paid almost no corporate income tax.Company officials wanted to keep it that way. So Apple sought alternatives to the tax arrangement Ireland would soon shut down. And the officials wanted to be quiet about it.\u201cFor those of you who are not aware Apple are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,\u201d wrote Cameron Adderley, global head of Appleby\u2019s corporate department, in a March 20, 2014 email to other senior partners. \u201cThey also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.\u201dIn building Apple\u2019s new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor. A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago. The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax regulators. It has also fought international proposals for tax avoidance crackdowns.Baker McKenzie wanted to use a local Appleby office to maintain an offshore arrangement for Apple. For Appleby, Mr. Adderley said, this assignment was \u201ca tremendous opportunity for us to shine on a global basis with Baker McKenzie.\u201dBaker McKenzie\u2019s San Francisco office emailed a 14-item questionnaire in March 2014 to Appleby\u2019s offices in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey.\u201cConfirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities (such as board meetings, signing of important contracts) without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction,\u201d the document requested. Baker McKenzie also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: \u201cAre there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?\u201d(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, \u201cAs a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.\u201d)Apple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Appleby\u2019s office in Jersey, which is one of the Channel Islands and has strong links to the British banking system. Jersey makes its own laws and is not subject to most European Union legislation, making it a popular tax haven.But the plan to use Jersey faced a potential snag: In mid-2014, again under pressure from other governments, Irish ministers explored ending a tax shelter known as the \u201cdouble Irish,\u201d used by scores of companies, including the Appleby clients Allergan and Facebook, as well as Google, LinkedIn and other businesses.The double Irish allows companies to collect profits through one subsidiary that employs people in Ireland, then route those profits to an Irish mailbox subsidiary that is a tax resident of an offshore haven like Bermuda, Grand Cayman or the Isle of Man.Irish officials explored a ban on Irish companies claiming tax residency in tax havens. Executives at Allergan \u2014 which had used a double Irish for at least a decade, records show \u2014 tried to derail the rule change. Terilea Wielenga, then Allergan\u2019s head of tax, was also international president of the Tax Executives Institute, a trade group. She argued to the Irish finance ministry in July 2014 that any such changes should occur slowly.The campaign seemed to work. \u201cFor existing companies, there will be provision for a transition period until the end of 2020,\u201d Mr. Noonan declared in October 2014. The gradual phase-in would apply not just to existing companies but to any new ones created by December of that year.This gave Apple just enough time. By the end of the year, Jersey had become the new tax home of the Irish companies Apple Sales International and Apple Operations International.But a third Apple subsidiary, Apple Operations Europe, became resident in Ireland.Apple would not say why. But tax experts offer one possible reason. While media attention focused on Ireland\u2019s crackdown on the double Irish, officials announced a new measure: The country expanded its tax deductions for companies that move rights to intellectual property \u2014 like patents and trademarks \u2014 into Ireland. If an Irish company spent $15 billion buying such rights, even from a fellow subsidiary, it could claim a $1 billion tax deduction each year for 15 years.Apple declined to say whether it has availed itself of the new benefit.But J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova law professor and former I.R.S. official who reviewed the Appleby documents, concluded that there was a strong possibility the company moved intellectual property into Ireland to take advantage of the generous tax rules. Based on Apple\u2019s American securities filings, he estimated that the transfer was worth about $200 billion.That would mean that any income that Apple now generates in Ireland could be partially offset by more than $13 billion in tax deductions each year for 15 years.Apple\u2019s hunt for a tax haven is a familiar tale, said Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, who also reviewed the Appleby documents.\u201cThis is how it usually works: You close one tax shelter, and something else opens up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just goes on endlessly.\u201dSimon Bowers is a reporter for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Advertisement"}

Then Facebook, responsible for much of its success, almost killed it.Supported byTwo friends started a greeting card company on the internet. It was cheap to launch and it instantly reached millions. Then one day without warning, Facebook changed the way it did business.This is a story about survival in the age of Facebook, when a privately held algorithm can turn a beloved product into a hobby with no monetary value. Subplots include forays into alcohol, cheap laughs, and low-paid freelancers.\u201cIn the back of your head, especially back then, you\u2019re like, Is this the next million dollar idea?\u201d Mr. Mitchell, 48, said.Mr. Mitchell was a graphic designer; Mr. Lundy had a way with words. At the very least, they thought, they could create cards for their friends.\u201cAnd at the very best we could leave our advertising jobs,\u201d Mr. Lundy, 46, said. \u201cThat was the ambitious side of us, that we could figure out this business that we knew nothing about.\u201d Their product, they thought, was tailor-made for the social network of Facebook: fast, funny and intensely shareable.\u201cFacebook has grown at a pace and had an impact that it\u2019s really hard to say anybody planned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just a mere commercial platform. It\u2019s a place that people are turning to to get their sense of what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201cThat\u2019s a combination that should be carefully navigated,\u201d Mr. Zittrain said. \u201cIt would be awfully strange, back in the day, if the Yellow Pages rearranged themselves every other day.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s good news,\u201d said May Wilkerson, an editor on the site. \u201cWe\u2019re at 18 million sessions for the month so far, up from 16.7 million at this point last month.\u201dWhat was drawing those users, though, was not e-cards but a stream of articles about things that were popular on the internet at that moment, including a celebrity\u2019s new \u201cboob tattoo\u201d and a dermatologist who called herself Dr. Pimple Popper, with a 15-minute video of a \u201cnever ending\u201d cyst doing \u2014 well, you can imagine what it was doing.More than half a million people watched the video.\u201cOld reliable,\u201d said Orli Matlow, one of the writers, noting that this was not the first time the company had posted videos from Dr. Pimple Popper.Two writers in the room said they were physically repelled by the video. All agreed this was a good thing.These hourly blog posts have replaced e-cards as the company\u2019s main source of revenue. How long that will last before the company has to reinvent itself again is anyone\u2019s guess.For a humor company, the office was short on banter. The staff communicated mainly through Slack, the messaging app. WeWork, with its cold brew iced coffee on tap, supplied a fun-ish workplace with no personal design touches, and Slack enabled camaraderie without actual discussions.When the two friends started the company in 2007, with $350,000 in seed money, their plan was to produce e-cards, build a following and possibly sell to a larger company.The first two steps came quickly. Using stock line drawings found on the internet, they wrote wry texts \u2014 an early favorite was, \u201cWhen work feels overwhelming, remember that you\u2019re going to die\u201d \u2014 and posted them on Facebook. When people clicked on a card, it sent them to the company website, which contained paid advertising. Within a year, the site was drawing 1.5 million visitors a month. The founders hired more writers. Traffic to the site reached 5 million visitors a month.Then four years ago, something changed. Cards that might once have reached 200,000 people were suddenly reaching only a few hundred, Mr. Mitchell said.By then, Facebook had become the equivalent of television in the 1960s, said Nicole Ames, who runs a digital marketing firm called Twist IMC. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest dog on the porch,\u201d she said. But for the companies that grew there, she said, it was impossible to know what formula it used to determine which posts appeared in users\u2019 news feeds. When Facebook cut down on images that directed users to other sites, companies like Someecards were blindsided.\u201cYou spent years building up this organic following, and now your content no longer shows up unless you pay,\u201d Ms. Ames said. \u201cI tell clients all the time, you play in Facebook\u2019s playpen, and if they change something, it\u2019s their game, it\u2019s their rules.\u201dAlthough e-cards remain popular, they now mostly provide an identity for the company, distinguishing it from other internet humor sites, Mr. Mitchell said. Freelancers submit texts for cards, and earn $25 for each one chosen.\u201cTwelve million people can look at them on Facebook, but we don\u2019t make any money from that,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. The company tried to sell the cards for a while, but there was not enough interest.Instead, the staff uses the Someecards style to create branded advertising for Showtime, Splenda and other clients, relying on Facebook shares.\u201cIf we can make you happy enough to share it with your friends, then your friends will be advertised to, and you\u2019ll be advertising,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cFacebook\u2019s algorithm plays to that too. If we post this and people don\u2019t like it, it goes away. We need you to share.\u201dMr. Lundy said he had given up worrying about the uncertainty, because there was nothing he could do about it. But Mr. Mitchell pointed to a recent experiment in six countries, where Facebook stopped including posts from publishers in users\u2019 news feeds, relegating them to a separate feed. Companies lost most of their readership overnight, Mr. Mitchell said.\u201cGoogle and Facebook have so much power,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cWhen they make these changes you have to be ready and have ideas. There could be a day where we\u2019re out of ideas. Hasn\u2019t happened yet. So I worry about it. I try to keep that concern in that place that doesn\u2019t paralyze you, but keeps you motivated to keep doing new things.\u201dIn the meantime, the company survives by Facebook\u2019s algorithms and the tastes of the American public, which turns out to favor a vivid dermatology video.\u201cI\u2019ve had friends complain,\u201d Mr. Mitchell admitted. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t look at Dr. Pimple Popper. But all I can say is, the way Facebook works, if you people out there weren\u2019t clicking on Dr. Pimple Popper, it wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201dThis, he said, is a winning formula, at least for now.\u201cSomebody is watching that stuff, and a lot of people are watching it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Tour With an Islamic Pop Star Who Makes Fans Swoon", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBIRMINGHAM, England \u2014 About 11 p.m. one recent Friday, in a room backstage at the International Convention Center here, the pop star Maher Zain, dressed all in white, was meeting his fans after a sold-out 90-minute show.Fiaza Kausar, a 23-year-old receptionist for a vacuum cleaner company, walked up to him, somehow managing to keep her cool. \u201cWhen you\u2019re having a bad day or something you just listen to him and you feel happier,\u201d she\u2019d said earlier, adding that she plays his music out loud at work.After taking a photograph, she faced him and said, \u201cMay Allah bless you with happiness and success always.\u201d Mr. Zain smiled and touched his hand to his heart. Then Ms. Kausar was ushered out of the room, and replaced by more people who had each paid 150 pounds, or about $200, for the chance to meet him.Given his popularity, his public image is surprisingly narrow: focused on his charity work and little else except the fact he likes working out. In Birmingham, fans asked what they knew of Mr. Zain other than his music could say only that he is a family man and role model.Sitting in a London hotel room three days after the Birmingham concert, Mr. Zain denied having any strategy for a public image. \u201cI\u2019m the same guy on and offstage,\u201d he said. He added that he liked his privacy and the quiet life in Sweden.\u201cI don\u2019t want to live this life, basically. I really don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Zain added. \u201cI believe I\u2019m on a mission and you cannot turn it down, you know what I mean? I\u2019ve been chosen.\u201dMr. Zain was born in Lebanon, but, when he was 8, his parents sold their car and other possessions to buy fake Swedish visas so they could escape the country\u2019s civil war. Mr. Zain remembers little from this time, apart from playing in the snow shortly after arriving in his new country: \u201cYou\u2019re just a kid \u2014 everything\u2019s new and fun,\u201d he said.Music was largely a hobby for Mr. Zain until his 20s, when he met Nadir Khayat, the Swedish-Moroccan music producer known as RedOne, who has worked with high-profile artists like Lady Gaga and Shakira. Mr. Khayat needed an assistant, and Mr. Zain went to the United States to work for him. But just before RedOne hit the big time, Mr. Zain returned to Sweden to take a break. \u201cIt was supposed to be a short time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was, like, \u2018I will go back, I will go back\u2019 \u2014 but that didn\u2019t happen.\u201dInstead, Mr. Zain said, he rediscovered his faith \u2014 though he is vague about the details. He said he had experienced many difficulties in his teens and mid-20s. \u201cIt\u2019s everything from a love story to family problems,\u201d he said, \u201cthings every youngster goes through.\u201d There was an identity crisis, too: \u201cI had many questions about life and death. It doesn\u2019t make sense that I\u2019m just born and then I\u2019m going to work and I\u2019m going to have fun, whatever I\u2019m going to do, then die and that\u2019s it.\u201dAll that meant he was receptive when an acquaintance invited him to a lecture at a mosque. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how this started,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit wasn\u2019t a hallelujah experience.\u201d He said it took time for his faith to grow, \u201cto be strong enough to say, \u2018I want to leave it behind, all these opportunities.\u2019\u201d\u201cIslam for me is not just about God, about the Prophet; Islam is emotions, it\u2019s human beings, it\u2019s what I breathe, it\u2019s what I do every day,\u201d Mr. Zain said. \u201cJust by waking up and hugging my wife, that\u2019s Islam.\u201dHe still kicks himself for failing to mention Allah in one track on his debut album. Faith, he said, \u201cis not something I shy away from.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite. I\u2019m proud of it.\u201dDuring an hourlong interview, Mr. Zain was charming and carefree. The only time he seemed ruffled was when discussing politics.Mr. Zain is very active on social media and regularly highlights issues that affect Muslims. He has championed the support that Mr. Erdogan, the president of Turkey, has shown to the Rohingya in Myanmar and to Syrian refugees, for instance. (Turkey is doing what \u201cno one in the world has done,\u201d Mr. Zain said.)But he insisted that highlighting such issues was \u201cmore humanity than politics.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really, like, so not into politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you see these things, I feel as a human and as an artist I have a responsibility to highlight what people are going through.\u201dA few hours after the interview, Mr. Zain took the stage at Central Hall Westminster. The show was far livelier and louder than Birmingham\u2019s. At one point, two teenage girls, wearing abayas and head scarves, stood on their chairs to see better and sing along, and were reprimanded by security.\u201cAnd if she\u2019s not with you anymore, don\u2019t forget to pray for her, inshallah,\u201d he added. The audience swooned.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Trial Begins for the Nevada Rancher Cliven Bundy", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 When Cliven Bundy refused to hand over his trespassing cattle to officials in 2014, he inspired an armed standoff that highlighted sharp divisions over the power of the federal government and the ways Americans use public lands.A guilty verdict for Mr. Bundy could reinforce Washington\u2019s control of these acres, while an acquittal could embolden those who ignore federal rules.Ian Bartrum, a law professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said the case raised questions about whether land protection was \u201csomething the federal government can even do.\u201dMr. Bundy\u2019s family has ranched in Bunkerville, Nev., for generations. But when the government announced new land-use rules in the 1990s, Mr. Bundy stopped paying grazing fees and racked up a $1 million debt. In April 2014, federal agents finally moved in to confiscate his livestock.The government agents withdrew, and in the end, not a shot was fired. Months later, Mr. Bundy\u2019s sons Ammon and Ryan started a second confrontation when they decided to occupy a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon.The trial beginning on Tuesday involves only the Nevada conflict. Mr. Bundy is charged with more than a dozen felonies, including conspiracy to commit an offense against the nation and assault on a federal officer. Ammon, Ryan and an ally named Ryan Payne are also charged.The main question in the case is whether the conflict at the wash was a \u201cmassive armed assault\u201d on officers, as the government states in its indictment, or an exercise of free speech by Mr. Bundy and others who believe that Washington should relinquish control of federally owned acres.In the footnotes of the thousands of documents related to the case, Mr. Bundy\u2019s lawyer previews his trial strategy, comparing Mr. Bundy with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the stand at Bunkerville with the 1965 march on Selma.\u201cPerhaps the most famous civil rights demonstrations in American history,\u201d writes Bret O. Whipple, \u201cinvolved demonstrators who \u2018advanced\u2019 and \u2018moved forward\u2019 against the commands of public authorities.\u201dTo strengthen the argument that he is a political prisoner, Mr. Bundy will wear jail-issued blue scrubs and orange flip-flops during the trial, rather than a suit and tie.If convicted, Mr. Bundy and the others could spend decades in prison.A challenge for prosecutors, legal experts say, will be persuading the jury to trust the government\u2019s side of the story in the face of a wave of anti-institutionalism that has influenced everything from the presidential election on down.\u201cThere is a fundamental distrust of institutions that wasn\u2019t there when we were prosecuting cases 10 years ago,\u201d said Ethan D. Knight, an assistant United States attorney, who tried Mr. Bundy\u2019s sons for their role in the takeover in Oregon. \u201cWe underestimated that.\u201dIn that case, a jury acquitted the Bundy sons, just days before the election of Donald J. Trump.Eighteen lesser players in the Oregon takeover received convictions or entered guilty pleas.Mr. Bundy\u2019s fans cheered in appreciation. Mr. Trump has not responded.Law-enforcement actions could also influence the trial.Agent Dan Love led the federal Bureau of Land Management\u2019s response during the standoff. But recent reports have cast doubt on his ability to properly handle the case.The defense is seeking to compel Mr. Love to testify in the standoff trial, a clear effort to use Mr. Love\u2019s behavior to discredit government action. So far, Judge Gloria Navarro has said it is \u201ctoo premature to determine if a motion to compel is appropriate.\u201dWith more than 1,000 potential witnesses in the case, the trial could last through February.Mr. Bundy\u2019s Nevada standoff began a wave of acts of defiance against restrictions on government-controlled acres.A Utah county commissioner led an ATV ride through a canyon that had been closed to protect Native American artifacts. Armed protesters in Oregon swarmed a mining area after officials told the mine owner to stop work. A ranching family in Battle Mountain, Nev., released cattle onto drought-stricken public land, despite an order not to do so.These activities have alarmed people who view land-use rules as critical to environmental protection.\u201cIf the Bundys are acquitted,\u201d said Jennifer Rokala, director of the conservation group Center for Western Priorities, \u201cthat sends a chilling message to park rangers and land managers that their ability to do their job safely is at risk.\u201d\u201cWhat happened here in 2014, I\u2019ve never seen government overreach quite like that,\u201d Angie Bundy, Ryan\u2019s wife, said in an interview. \u201cI do believe that God will deliver my husband,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s in the hands of evil right now.\u201dMr. Bundy and his sons Ammon, Ryan, Mel and Dave have been jailed for nearly two years, leaving their wives with a heavy load. Mel\u2019s wife, Briana, said there were 26 children under the age of 15 among the jailed men. (Mel and Dave will be tried at a later date.)A July fund-raiser here was just one of many events around the West designed to help pay the family\u2019s legal fees and other costs. That evening, hundreds of people crowded a party hall staffed by bartenders in tuxedos. The Bundy women wore black dresses bearing the words \u201cWe the People.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Savenni\u00e8res, Age Comes With Benefits", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolWine can put extraordinary demands on consumers.When you buy a car, you drive it away. Plug in a new television, and you can roll with laughter at a favorite comedy. But buy a few bottles of the latest vintage of a fine wine? Often, you are expected to stow it someplace cool, dark and protected and forget about it for years.Bet you were not aware that wine is great training for 401(k)\u2019s and other examples of responsibly delaying gratification.Here at Wine School we are often on the wrong end of the aging curve. In our effort to share the experience of drinking wines, we rely on what is generally available in wine shops: the most recent vintages. It is hard enough for many people to find even these newly issued bottles. Trying to ferret out a generous, reasonably priced supply of well-aged bottles would be virtually impossible.For the last few weeks we have been drinking Savenni\u00e8res, a great chenin blanc of the Anjou. Among other things, the wines have given us firsthand experience of the aging conundrum. Each of the three bottles I recommended would have benefited from a few more years in the bottle.These are educated estimates on my part. But that does not mean these bottles, or two of them at least, could not be profitably enjoyed right now. It is simply that experiencing the greater potential of these wines is not yet possible.Among those experienced with properly aged wines, uncorking a fine bottle prematurely will draw aghast grimaces and cries of infanticide. That is an overly dramatic metaphor, obviously, but it conveys the generally accepted notion that opening a bottle too soon is a horror.Is it really? It depends on the purpose. With wines that benefit the most from aging \u2014 like Bordeaux, Burgundy, Rioja and Barolo among reds \u2014 a bottle at a peak moment is a blessing to be savored. The awareness of this potential has also bred a nagging, almost paralyzing fear among many wine drinkers that they have failed in pinpointing that blink-of-an-eye apogee.Please take heart. Good, age-worthy wines do not have just one instant of fulfilled potential. Like people, bottles experience an arc of aging during which many high points emerge.To enjoy a red Burgundy at the height of its youthful power \u2014 as it proudly displays itself in all its gorgeous plumage \u2014 leads to a richer understanding of the beauty of its middle-aged complexity, and then to a profound empathy, if not love, for the stately dignity of its declining years.This arc is why it has often been said that great wine cannot be understood by drinking a single bottle. A case is required to grasp it in all of its manifestations.Well, that conceit will not stop us. We are drinking these Savenni\u00e8res young, perhaps even too young, yet we can still learn a thing or two. For one, it is important to understand what is meant by \u201cyoung.\u201dI suggested that the Closel La Jalousie was meant to be consumed on the younger side. It is an introductory Savenni\u00e8res, aged in steel tanks rather than barrels to preserve its fresh fruitiness.The wine was understated, as Savenni\u00e8res ought to be. Nonetheless it was delightful, with subtle aromas and flavors of stone fruits and flowers, and a touch of woolliness. This is not a wine that will evolve for years \u2014 Closel makes other cuv\u00e9es for longer aging \u2014 but with time it will become more expressive and less hesitant.The $60 Boudignon, almost twice as expensive as the $32 Closel, is a more ambitious wine. It was aged in oak barrels rather than tanks, which is clear from the aromas, especially if you sniffed it directly after the Closel. Yet the oak was well integrated on the palate, and the wine will get less obviously aromatic with time.More important, the barrel aging can be felt in the texture of the wine, which seems to have an extra dimension compared with the simpler Jalousie. It has a mildly peachy flavor and a persistent mineral sensation, which I loved. The 2015 vintage was quite warm, but the Boudignon was precise and well shaped, with great acidity. This is a terrific Savenni\u00e8res, and it will only get better.Knowing that the proprietor recommends decanting this wine 48 hours in advance, even when sufficiently aged, I followed the advice, though I sampled it along the way.Botrytis can afflict grapes intended for dry wines, too. Certain vintages of white Burgundy, like 1986, are marked by an almost exotic complexity conferred by botrytis, and it often shows up in Savenni\u00e8res, though not to the extent I\u2019ve seen in the wines of Joly.With time in the decanter, the Joly became more and more interesting, and more drinkable, developing the wet wool character, along with an aroma of chamomile. After 48 hours, it had a distinct mineral quality, and an undeniable complexity.At this stage, drinking the 2015 Les Vieux Clos was more educational than enjoyable, a lesson in the difference between oxidative and oxidized wines, which are ruined by exposure to air. It was also a reminder that, yes, some wines simply are too young to drink.Let\u2019s be clear: Most mass-market wines need no aging at all. They are ready to drink as soon as you buy them. But many good wines, even if a small percentage of all bottles sold, do benefit from time in the bottle.As the audience for fine wines has become more democratized, and fewer people have the resources to age bottles, the industry has made an effort to produce wines that are ready sooner, even if some qualities ultimately are lost. Even so, it is disheartening to open a highly touted restaurant wine list to see great Burgundies, Barolos and the like from the most recent vintages. That is the time to order Beaujolais.Still, it is encouraging to know that some producers, like Joly, cling to the tradition of making wines that require long aging. It is a reminder that great wine is a living thing. While it is possible to adapt wines to the more superficial requirements of modern life, it is nice to be reminded of what we are missing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australia Votes for Gay Marriage, Clearing Path to Legalization", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 A solid majority of Australians voted in favor of same-sex marriage in a historic survey that, while not binding, paves the way for Parliament to legally recognize the unions of gay and lesbian couples.Of 12.7 million Australians who took part in the government survey, 61.6 percent voted yes and 38.4 percent voted no, officials announced on Wednesday morning. Participation was high, with 79.5 percent of voting-age Australians sending back their postal ballots.\u201cThe Australian people have spoken, and they have voted overwhelmingly \u2018yes\u2019 for marriage equality,\u201d said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who called the survey in a move described by advocates as a delay tactic devised to appease his party\u2019s far-right faction. \u201cThey voted \u2018yes\u2019 for fairness, they voted \u2018yes\u2019 for commitment, they voted \u2018yes\u2019 for love.\u201dThe high turnout and unequivocal result amounted to a rebuke for Australia\u2019s most conservative politicians, many of whom saw a majority of their constituents vote to support same-sex marriage despite their arguments against it.Proponents of gay rights spent the day celebrating. They gathered in cities around the country to watch news broadcasts of the survey results. The largest crowd, at Prince Alfred Park in Sydney, broke into cheers, with hugs, dancing and tears, as soon as the news was announced.\u201cThis is our proudest moment as gay and lesbian Australians,\u201d said Chris Lewis, 60, an artist from Sydney, who waved a large rainbow flag he bought in San Francisco about 30 years ago. \u201cFinally I can be proud of my country.\u201dBut many Australians said it was also late in coming.Annika Lowry, 42, who brought her 4-year-old daughter to the celebration, said the vote revealed a widening gap between Australia\u2019s political class and voters who have been demanding same-sex marriage legislation for years.\u201cIt was not just about us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s for our kids, so that they know equality is important.\u201dAlex Greenwich, a state lawmaker from New South Wales and the co-chairman of Australian Marriage Equality, an advocacy group, said the vote \u201cshows that Australians have truly come together in support of their gay and lesbian mates and have said that everybody should be able to have the freedom to marry.\u201dIn calling for the national survey, Mr. Turnbull sought public backing for a shift in social policy that was opposed by many members of his center-right Liberal Party.Mr. Turnbull voted yes, and he urged other Australians to do so as a matter of fairness, seeking to blunt opposition from far-right members of his party.\u201cMy commitment was to give every Australian their say,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said after the results were announced. \u201cThat has been done, they have spoken.\u201dHe added: \u201cNow it is up to us, here in the Parliament of Australia, to get on with it \u2014 to get on with the job the Australian people have tasked us to do, and get this done, this year, before Christmas.\u201dDean Smith, a federal senator from the Liberal Party, who is gay, said that he would immediately introduce a bill to legalize same-sex marriage. He said on Tuesday that he believed he had the votes to pass the legislation in the Senate and send it to Parliament\u2019s lower house for approval.Lyle Shelton, a Christian lobbyist who was the \u201cno\u201d campaign\u2019s most outspoken advocate, said he would begrudgingly \u201caccept the democratic decision.\u201d\u201cMillions of Australians will always believe the truth about marriage, that it\u2019s between one man and one woman,\u201d Mr. Shelton said. \u201cIt could take years, if not decades, to win that back.\u201dThe record of subjecting same-sex marriage to a public vote remains mixed.As the deadline approached for citizens to mail in their ballots, passions were inflamed by heartfelt pleas and vitriolic attacks.Many supporters of same-sex marriage opposed the survey, saying that human rights should not be a matter for an up-or-down vote and urging Parliament to decide the matter.Estimates put the cost of the survey around 122 million Australian dollars, or $97 million. The poll was not a legally required step for changing the law.Although legalization is not guaranteed, the results announced on Wednesday make the country\u2019s path to same-sex marriage much clearer.Mr. Greenwich said the outcome delivered \u201can unequivocal mandate for Parliament to legislate for this bill as soon as possible for a fair bill this year.\u201dFocus has already shifted to that bill, and what form it will take.\u201cAfter a cost of 122 million, and over two months of campaigning and years of public discussion, it makes no sense to delay a parliamentary debate,\u201d Mr. Smith, the Liberal senator, said in an interview. \u201cAustralians upheld their end of the bargain by voting en masse. Now it\u2019s time for Parliament to uphold its end of the same deal.\u201dMr. Smith\u2019s bill provides for some religious protections and allows members of the clergy to refuse to solemnize marriages that conflict with their beliefs.\u201cThat bill is obviously manifestly inadequate,\u201d said Mr. Shelton, the opponent of same-sex marriage, who added that it focused on wedding ceremonies. \u201cThe \u2018yes\u2019 side should make good on its promise that no one else\u2019s freedoms would be affected. They\u2019ve maintained this all along. They\u2019ve said that our concerns about freedom of speech and freedom of religion are red herrings.\u201dMr. Shelton said Mr. Smith\u2019s bill would affect Muslim and Christian schools that wish to teach that marriage is between one man and one woman. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about bakers and florists being taken to court, as has occurred in the United States,\u201d he added.An alternative bill, proposed by another Liberal Party senator, James Paterson, has more robust religious protections. His bill would allow service providers like bakers and photographers to refuse service to same-sex couples, without facing legal action. His bill would provide additional anti-discrimination protections for religious people and businesses opposed to gay marriage. Reflecting the national debate that often centered on the well-being of children, Mr. Paterson\u2019s bill would allow parents the right to take their children out of classes that \u201cconflict with their values.\u201dIn the dwindling days of the campaign \u2014 with \u201cyes\u201d looking more and more likely to prevail \u2014 many conservatives on the opposing side pushed for Mr. Paterson\u2019s bill, saying that it provided the best protections for free speech and religion. But Mr. Turnbull said he did not believe Mr. Paterson\u2019s bill could pass Parliament. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Australians would welcome, and certainly the government would not countenance, making legal discrimination that is illegal, that is unlawful, today.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no denying that this has been tough for many people. This has been a campaign which has gone on for more than 10 years,\u201d said Mr. Greenwich, the same-sex marriage advocate. \u201cThis result is a reflection of the leadership that\u2019s been shown by everyday Australians during this campaign. It shows that Australians truly did have the opportunity to shape our nation as a fairer and more equal place.\u201dAdam Baidawi reported from Melbourne, and Damien Cave from Sydney, Australia.

{"Headline": "Uber Hid 2016 Breach, Paying Hackers to Delete Stolen Data", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber disclosed Tuesday that hackers had stolen 57 million driver and rider accounts and that the company had kept the data breach secret for more than a year after paying a $100,000 ransom.The deal was arranged by the company\u2019s chief security officer and under the watch of the former chief executive, Travis Kalanick, according to several current and former employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were private.The security officer, Joe Sullivan, has been fired. Mr. Kalanick was forced out in June, although he remains on Uber\u2019s board.The two hackers stole data about the company\u2019s riders and drivers \u2014 including phone numbers, email addresses and names \u2014 from a third-party server and then approached Uber and demanded $100,000 to delete their copy of the data, the employees said.Uber acquiesced to the demands, and then went further. The company tracked down the hackers and pushed them to sign nondisclosure agreements, according to the people familiar with the matter. To further conceal the damage, Uber executives also made it appear as if the payout had been part of a \u201cbug bounty\u201d \u2014 a common practice among technology companies in which they pay hackers to attack their software to test for soft spots.The details of the attack remained hidden until Tuesday. The ride-hailing company said it had discovered the breach as part of a board investigation into Uber\u2019s business practices.But the handling of the breach underscores the extent to which Uber executives were willing to go to protect the $70 billion ride-hailing giant\u2019s reputation and business, even at the potential cost of breaking users\u2019 trust and, perhaps more important, state and federal laws. The New York attorney general\u2019s office said on Tuesday that it had opened an investigation into the matter.A spokeswoman for Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.The breach is also a black mark for Mr. Sullivan, who was a prominent figure in the information security industry. Mr. Sullivan joined Uber as the company\u2019s first chief security officer in 2015, after serving as the head of security at Facebook for seven years.Unlike many cybersecurity executives, Mr. Sullivan was previously a lawyer and had studied cyberlaw at the University of Miami. He began his career in the technology industry as a federal prosecutor during the tech boom of the late 1990s, working at companies including eBay in 2002, where he was head of trust and safety.Mr. Sullivan\u2019s decision to join Uber was seen as a win for the company. As Uber\u2019s ranks of drivers and riders had grown, people in and outside the company became worried about privacy and security. Uber had faced complaints about driver and rider assaults, as well as allegations that it was not doing enough to protect rider data. Mr. Sullivan was tasked with keeping drivers and riders safe.The other Uber employee who was fired alongside Mr. Sullivan was Craig Clark, the company\u2019s legal director of security and law enforcement. Neither Mr. Sullivan nor Mr. Clark responded to requests for comment.\u201cCompanies are funding organized crime, an industry of criminals is being created,\u201d said Kevin Beaumont, a cybersecurity expert based in Britain. \u201cThe good guys are creating a market for the bad guys. We\u2019re enabling them to monetize what years ago would have been teenagers in bedrooms breaching companies for fun.\u201dThis latest breach puts Uber in another difficult situation just as the company is working to repair its battered image and preparing to seek an initial public offering in 2019. Mr. Khosrowshahi has characterized his tenure at the company as \u201cUber 2.0.\u201d As part of that, he has tossed out the aggressive corporate values that were prized by Mr. Kalanick and given the ride-hailing service a new list of values that includes \u201cdoing the right thing. Period.\u201dUber has hired Matt Olsen, former general counsel at the National Security Agency, as an adviser, and has retained Mandiant, a security firm, to conduct an independent investigation of the security breach. Uber said Mr. Olsen planned to reorganize the company\u2019s security team.But the damage has already been done, and Uber officials are aware of the long road back to good standing with the public.While it is not illegal to pay money to hackers, Uber may have violated several laws in its interaction with them.By demanding that the hackers destroy the stolen data, Uber may have violated a Federal Trade Commission rule on breach disclosure that prohibits companies from destroying any forensic evidence in the course of their investigation.The company may have also violated state breach disclosure laws by not disclosing the theft of Uber drivers\u2019 stolen data. If the data stolen was not encrypted, Uber would have been required by California state law to disclose that driver\u2019s license data from its drivers had been stolen in the course of the hacking.An Uber spokesman declined to comment.Mike Isaac and Sheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco, and Katie Benner from New York.

Mr. Ramadan is a grandson of Hassan al-Banna, who founded the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in the 1920s. He is the author of a dozen books in English on modern Islam and the Western world, and a familiar presence on television news shows and on social media.Ms. Ayari accused Mr. Ramadan of raping and assaulting her in a hotel on the sidelines of a conference in Paris in 2012. She said Mr. Ramadan had acted as an online teacher and mentor to her and then had suggested one day that they meet at his hotel.Ms. Ayari has lodged a complaint with the French police, alleging rape, sexual assault, harassment and intimidation. Her lawyers said she had also submitted evidence with her complaint.A second Frenchwoman has also filed a complaint with the police in Paris, accusing Mr. Ramadan of assaulting and raping her in a hotel in Lyon in 2009. That woman, who has not been named publicly, described a horrifying assault by Mr. Ramadan to two French newspapers.Other allegations have surfaced in French and Swiss newspapers, including accounts from two women who said they had sexual relations with Mr. Ramadan before they had reached the age of consent, and a third who described having a consensual but violent relationship with him.Students at Oxford\u2019s Faculty of Oriental Studies, where Mr. Ramadan teaches, had complained about the university\u2019s slow response to the allegations, according to Cherwell, a student newspaper.Members of the faculty at first said they expected Mr. Ramadan to continue teaching and supervising students last week, but complaints from students grew, the newspaper reported.Mr. Ramadan\u2019s leave of absence \u201cimplies no presumption or acceptance of guilt and allows Professor Ramadan to address the extremely serious allegations made against him,\u201d Oxford\u2019s statement said, \u201cwhile meeting our principal concern \u2014 addressing heightened and understandable distress, and putting first the well-being of our students and staff.\u201dAsked about students\u2019 complaints, Eugene Rogan, director of the Middle East Center at St. Anthony\u2019s, emphasized that student security was a paramount concern.\u201cIt is important to note that since the reported meeting Tariq Ramadan has not taught at Oxford and, in fact, has not been in the city,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNevertheless, my colleagues and I contacted each of Professor Ramadan\u2019s students, and made alternative teaching arrangements for any student who asked for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Reversal, Tech Companies Back Sex Trafficking Bill", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe companies had argued that they had worked hard to combat sex trafficking on their services, but that the bill would jeopardize a free and open internet, as well as subject them to many potential lawsuits for the actions of users.But companies have come under increasingly harsh scrutiny in recent weeks, particularly for their role helping to spread Russia propaganda during the 2016 presidential election. This week, executives at Facebook, Twitter and Google faced tough questions from lawmakers in three congressional hearings.After weeks of negotiating over details, an internet lobbying group announced on Friday that it had ended its battle to squash the bill.The bill \u201cwill grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association.Congressional aides said the internet companies had been invited to weigh in on the bill before it was introduced in August, but they declined. The companies then forcefully came out in opposition, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users were hard to police.Lawmakers said the new bill contained modest changes that clarified that state law enforcement officials would have to use federal law as their basis of suits, one of the final sticking points for the companies. And the new draft contained language that only websites that knowingly assisted and supported sex trafficking would be targeted.\u201cThis important bill will hold online sex traffickers accountable and help give trafficking survivors the justice they deserve,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The bill amends Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, established in 1996, that protects online companies from liability over content they hosted on their sites. Companies say that law has allowed internet services like Google and Facebook to thrive.But with broad support, legislators said some smaller companies had hidden behind Section 230.\u201cRemoving the unwarranted shield from legal responsibility will save countless children from horrific tragedy, both physical and emotional,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said.Consumer advocates said that the law put the big companies on notice as well.\u201cThis is a chink in the Teflon of Google and Facebook\u2019s shield of immunity,\u201d said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Upside of Being Ruled by the Five Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. But what if that\u2019s not so bad?For a year and a half \u2014 and more urgently for much of the last month \u2014 I have warned of the growing economic, social and political power held by the five largest American tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.That\u2019s not ridiculous. Over the last few weeks, several scholars said there are good reasons to be sanguine about our new tech overlords. Below, I compiled their best arguments about the bright side of the Five.Tech is inherently messy. The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them. This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow. The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo \u2014 and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides.One benefit of having five giant companies in charge of today\u2019s tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems.Consider Russian propaganda. People have worried about the internet\u2019s capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades \u2014 from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism \u2014 the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation. But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies \u2014 one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs \u2014 it was never conceivable to limit that era\u2019s equivalent of fake news.Today, it suddenly is. Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control.This does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates \u2014 and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression. But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms.\u201cThis is new stuff everybody is dealing with \u2014 it\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of \u201cBig Is Beautiful,\u201d a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies. (The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.) \u201cSo when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier. You\u2019ve got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor.\u201dOver the last few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome \u2014 so why was I including their company in that group?This dynamic \u2014 where each company competes mightily against the others \u2014 suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d with Mr. Atkinson. \u201cAs long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then what\u2019s to complain about?\u201dYou can see this in their product road maps. None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control \u2014 for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop.At the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies. And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways \u2014 with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics.\u201cSo, why pre-emptively say that maybe we\u2019ll be harmed in the future \u2014 that in 2030 they\u2019ll jack up their prices or something?\u201d Mr. Lind asked. \u201cWell, deal with that as it comes.\u201dThe Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale. Thanks to economic dynamics like network effects \u2014 where a product, like Facebook, gets more useful as more people use it \u2014 it was perhaps inevitable that we would see the rise of a handful of large companies take control of much of the modern tech business.I don\u2019t mean this list to get the Five off the hook. How we deal with their efforts to capture more power over the economy and our society is perhaps the next great question facing America. But this is a complex problem precisely because there are both advantages and disadvantages to their size.As I said, tech is messy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Same-Sex Marriage and Australian Democracy", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 34______But if the high turnout and victory showed the health of Australia\u2019s democracy, as many people said it did, there were also quite a few arguing that the survey itself pointed to the country\u2019s biggest problem: a divided, out-of-touch legislature that often lags behind other countries and its own constituents on the important issues of the day.But as is often the case, there was nowhere near enough room to include all the insightful and interesting comments we collected on the issue, even just this week. So rather than let it all go to waste, I figured I\u2019d share a few outtakes here.Now here are a few of those outtakes, followed by a roundup of other Timesian work and a recommendation.An Ugly Process\u201cThe fact that a referendum on an issue such as equal access to marriage is allowed is in itself a problem with respect to the notion of democracy: as democracies, we rely on majorities to make decisions, and this gives us the enormous responsibility of protecting minorities and never allowing majorities to make decisions on fundamental rights of minorities.Like other countries, Australia is a mix of people with very different beliefs, but this debate is a chance to become a better democracy through the recognition of the diverse identities of Australians and of the responsibility of establishing rules to protect the rights of minorities, and showing that these rights can never be subject to discretionary behavior.\u201dA Weaker Right?\u201cIt shows the influence of the conservative right is overstated because of their control of particular places in the media and the political hierarchies. And I think it gives some sort of hope to people that would like to see an opportunity to challenge the conservative right on issues like climate change, potentially \u2014 and also on issues like the treatment of refugees.Love and \u2018No\u2019\u201cThe same-sex marriage lobby have never really let the \u2018no\u2019 side express their case before. In the media and journalism, no offense, if you\u2019re against gay marriage it\u2019s a very negative thing in the profession.Now the postal vote has occurred, we\u2019re allowed to express our case. I think they\u2019re freaking out over that, they\u2019re not used to opposition. I think for the L.G.B.T.I. community, they\u2019ve been sold a lie and if we disagree with same-sex marriage we hate them. But you can still disagree with someone and still love a person.\u201dGay and Opposed to Marriage\u201cWhen I came out, being gay was about nonconformity and being different and not being the same as everyone else in society. Marriage is the ultimate in conformity. It\u2019s just not my thing.They\u2019ve been saying it\u2019s all about equality, but to me it\u2019s just sameness. I\u2019m not knocking anyone that wants to get married and I\u2019m not denying anyone who wants to do that. But in Australia, same-sex couples already have all the legal protections.And we\u2019re such a small minority, who are we to change anything that is important to a lot of people?\u201dA Painful ProcessSome of my friends who are older, who I would say have PTSD because of homophobic hate crimes they experienced in the \u201980s and \u201990s, this experience certainly triggered that PTSD and caused them a great deal of harm and torture.Witnessing that was incredibly difficult.\u201d____________Dr. Esperanza Cer\u00f3n, director of a group that campaigned for a tax on sugary drinks, experienced it firsthand. When she spoke up, Colombia\u2019s consumer protection agency barred her from talking about the link between sugar and obesity.____________You care about the planet, right?

Ryan and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, each told reporters that Mr. Conyers, Democrat of Michigan, should resign after a woman who settled a sexual harassment claim against him said on television that the lawmaker had \u201cviolated\u201d her body, repeatedly propositioned her for sex and asked her to touch his genitals.Additionally, Representative Joe Barton, a Republican and the Texas delegation\u2019s most senior House member, announced in an interview with The Dallas Morning News that he would not seek re-election after sexually suggestive online messages that he sent a constituent came to light.And an Ohio Army veteran on Thursday became the fifth woman to accuse Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, of inappropriate touching. Senior House Democrats began calling for Mr. Franken to resign.For weeks, both the House and the Senate have been reeling from the upheaval over sexual harassment and misconduct that already have leveled powerful men in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and media suites in New York and Washington. Thursday\u2019s developments added to the chaos on Capitol Hill as lawmakers sought to respond to allegations of sexual harassment while dealing with a proposed Republican overhaul of the tax code.\u201cThe allegations against Mr. Conyers, as we have learned more since Sunday, are serious, disappointing and very credible,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told reporters. \u201cIt is very sad. The brave women who came forward are owed justice. I pray for Congressman Conyers and his family and wish them well.\u201d\u201cHowever,\u201d she added, \u201cCongressman Conyers should resign.\u201dMinutes later, Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, told reporters he agreed. And several other Democrats, including Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the minority whip, and Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, also called on Mr. Conyers to resign.Representatives Joseph Crowley and Kathleen Rice, Democrats of New York, and Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, called on both Mr. Conyers and Mr. Franken to resign.Mr. Conyers, 88, was hospitalized overnight for dizziness, lightheadedness and shortness of breath. At a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Conyers\u2019s lawyer, Arnold E. Reed, dismissed Ms. Pelosi\u2019s demand and said he was only worried about whether Mr. Conyers\u2019s health would allow him to continue. He said Mr. Conyers did not plan to resign.\u201cNancy Pelosi did not elect the congressman, and she sure as hell won\u2019t be the one to tell the congressman to leave,\u201d Mr. Reed said.Mr. Reed, like some members of the Congressional Black Caucus, also hinted that Ms. Pelosi was treating Mr. Conyers unfairly.\u201cThere are, to my count, five of these allegations against Al Franken. There are three or four against the congressman,\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I would suspect that Nancy Pelosi is going to have to explain what is the discernible difference between Al Franken and John Conyers. That is a question she is going to have to answer.\u201dBut Mr. Conyers\u2019s case differs significantly from the charges of groping that are bedeviling Mr. Franken. None of Mr. Franken\u2019s accusers are employees, while Mr. Conyers has been accused of demanding sex from women in his office, and punishing some who did not comply.Ms. Brown appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and described Mr. Conyers\u2019s conduct as clear-cut sexual harassment. She said he once invited her to a hotel room, stood before her in his underwear and asked her to touch his genitals.\u201cSome of the things that he did, it was sexual harassment,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cViolating my body, propositioning me, inviting me to hotels with the guise of discussing business and then propositioning for sex. He just violated my body. He has touched me in different ways, and it was very uncomfortable and very unprofessional.\u201dMr. Conyers, who stepped aside this week from his post as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, has repeatedly denied Ms. Brown\u2019s claims and has said in statements and through his lawyer that he never sexually harassed any of his staff members.Ms. Brown, who appeared with her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, pushed back on Mr. Conyers\u2019s insistence that he did nothing wrong.\u201cHe pointed to genital areas of his body and asked me to, you know, touch it,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cI did tell him I was not going to do that, and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable.\u201dMr. Franken faced added pressure as well. On Thursday, Stephanie Kemplin, 41, an Ohio Army veteran, told CNN that Mr. Franken groped her breast in 2003, while she was deployed in Kuwait and he was a comedian on a U.S.O. tour.Ms. Kemplin said the incident happened while the two were taking a photo together and lasted five to 10 seconds. She said she eventually turned her body to shift Mr. Franken\u2019s hand off her breast before the picture was taken.\u201cWhen he put his arm around me, he groped my right breast. He kept his hand all the way over on my breast,\u201d Ms. Kemplin told CNN.An aide for Mr. Franken told CNN he had never \u201cintentionally engaged in this kind of conduct.\u201dMr. Barton later told The Dallas Morning News that he would not run for his congressional seat again. \u201cThere are enough people who lost faith in me that it\u2019s time to step aside and let there be a new voice for the 6th district in Washington, so I am not going to run for re-election,\u201d Mr. Barton said.Together, the new revelations added bipartisan pressure on House leaders to take a tougher stand against harassment. A bill being considered by the House would unmask settlements paid by lawmakers under nondisclosure agreements and end a practice of funding such settlements with taxpayer money. Forty-two Republicans and Democrats have signed on to the legislation so far.\u201cTaxpayer dollars should not be used as a congressional piggy bank to bail out members of Congress and staff who have committed acts of sexual harassment or assault,\u201d Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina, said. \u201cThat this has been swept under the rug and kept from the public \u2014 both the payments and the acts themselves \u2014 makes it even more egregious because it marginalizes the victims and acts to excuse the aggressors with little to no consequences.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Panic. Then Vote.", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe part that knocked the wind out of me about the bug thing wasn\u2019t really the story itself, it was the crystallization of how desperately, comically far we are from taking it, or anything, seriously as a planet. Instead of leaping into global collective action to mitigate the collapse of the biosphere and potential human extinction, America\u2019s ruling party is currently squabbling about whether they should punitively investigate Hillary Clinton over a routine committee decision from 2010 or for somehow rigging the election she lost. Why do we tolerate this from our elected employees? How is our basic animal survival instinct not sending us into open revolt?Even if we\u2019d elected that bat from \u201cFernGully\u201d last year instead of a gaseous, smoke-belching coal baron who seems to feel personally wronged by fresh air, pulling the planet back from disaster would still be a nail-biting scramble at this point. I speak as a seasoned, professional procrastinator: It would still be the second-to-last day of the semester, and we have not remotely started the reading. Instead, we\u2019re out in the woods burning our textbooks for warmth while we argue about whose job it is to chop down a tree to build a desk so we can start our kindergarten homework, and we don\u2019t even know how to build a desk.This week\u2019s indictments are satisfying, of course, and I feel faintly hopeful in a concrete way that I thought I\u2019d lost. But I\u2019m struggling to truly relish them. The efficacy of the Mueller investigation depends on so many unknowns, most pressingly whether the rule of law will hold after a year of President Trump\u2019s assaults on it \u2014 and whether Americans across the political spectrum can find our way back to some common truth.But even in the best-case scenario, even if every last corrupt cog in the Trump administration goes down, Trump\u2019s successor, our glorious deliverer, will just be some establishment Republican pushing the same old tax cuts for billionaires and E.B.T. cuts for the impoverished. We need to be surging ahead, aggressively, for survival; instead, we\u2019ll be dog-paddling around Mitt Romney\u2019s drain.Enough. Why are we doing this? Why are we allowing billionaires to trick us into letting them grind up and devour our country so they can briefly become trillionaires before we all either explode or burn or die slowly of famine? We have to stop. Fire these snakes and elect human beings who will at least try to take care of us. Our procrastination window is up, and it\u2019s time to close Facebook (that part works both inside and outside of the metaphor) and get serious about this all-nighter.For years I\u2019ve had a recurring dream about falling off a cliff. I never see what caused me to stumble, and I never reach the impact \u2014 in the dream I am trapped in the moment just after I go over, when I am still intact and conscious, still myself, but aware that I have made an irreversible mistake. I am alive and dead at the same time. The moment isn\u2019t scary; it\u2019s indescribably, breathtakingly sad.I have to believe that we, as a nation, have not quite reached that point of no return. We can regain our balance. It\u2019s easy to forget that the government does not just happen to us; we make it. But next week, all over the country, we have local elections, and local elections are where the next generation of national candidates come from \u2014 the people who may, eventually, fill the vacuum if the Mueller probe doesn\u2019t go well for the Republican Party.One of the most frightening questions about the Trump administration, and the Republican machine that laid the groundwork for it, is just how extensively they\u2019ve managed to savage voting rights, especially in our most vulnerable and marginalized communities. Maybe it\u2019s already worse than we think. Next week is one way to begin to find out. As of right now, we do know that Americans who didn\u2019t vote for President Trump vastly outnumber Americans who did. Use that power.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Uncounted", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "\n  The Razzos lived in the Woods, a bucolic neighborhood on the banks of the Tigris, where marble and stucco villas sprawled amid forests of eucalyptus, chinar and pine. Cafes and restaurants lined the riverbanks, but ever since the city fell to ISIS the previous year, Basim and Mayada had preferred to entertain at home. They would set up chairs poolside and put kebabs on the grill, and Mayada would serve pizza or Chinese fried rice, all in an effort to maintain life as they\u2019d always known it. Their son, Yahya, had abandoned his studies at Mosul University and fled for Erbil, and they had not seen him since; those who left when ISIS took over could re-enter the caliphate, but once there, they could not leave \u2014 an impasse that stranded people wherever they found themselves. Birthdays, weddings and graduations came and went, the celebrations stockpiled for that impossibly distant moment: liberation.\n\n  Next door to Basim\u2019s home stood the nearly identical home belonging to his brother, Mohannad, and his wife, Azza. They were almost certainly asleep at that hour, but Basim guessed that their 18-year-old son, Najib, was still up. A few months earlier, he was arrested by the ISIS religious police for wearing jeans and a T-shirt with English writing. They gave him 10 lashes and, as a further measure of humiliation, clipped his hair into a buzz cut. Now he spent most of his time indoors, usually on Facebook. \u201cSomeday it\u2019ll all be over,\u201d Najib had posted just a few days earlier. \u201cUntil that day, I\u2019ll hold on with all my strength.\u201d\n\n  Sometimes, after his parents locked up for the night, Najib would fish the key out of the cupboard and steal over to his uncle\u2019s house. Basim had the uncanny ability to make his nephew forget the darkness of their situation. He had a glass-half-full exuberance, grounded in the belief that every human life \u2014 every setback and success, every heartbreak and triumph \u2014 is written by the 40th day in the womb. Basim was not a particularly religious man, but that small article of faith underpinned what seemed to him an ineluctable truth, even in wartime Iraq: Everything happens for a reason. It was an assurance he offered everyone; Yahya had lost a year\u2019s worth of education, but in exile he had met, and proposed to, the love of his life. \u201cYou see?\u201d Basim would tell Mayada. \u201cYou see? That\u2019s fate.\u201d\n\n  Basim had felt this way for as long as he could remember. A 56-year-old account manager at Huawei, the Chinese multinational telecommunications company, he studied engineering in the 1980s at Western Michigan University. He and Mayada lived in Portage, Mich., in a tiny one-bedroom apartment that Mayada also used as the headquarters for her work as an Avon representative; she started small, offering makeup and skin cream to neighbors, but soon expanded sales to Kalamazoo and Comstock. Within a year, she\u2019d saved up enough to buy Basim a $700 Minolta camera. Basim came to rely on her ability to impose order on the strange and the mundane, to master effortlessly everything from Yahya\u2019s chemistry homework to the alien repartee of faculty picnics and Rotary clubs. It was fate. They had been married now for 33 years.\n\n  Around midnight, Basim heard a thump from the second floor. He peeked out of his office and saw a sliver of light under the door to the bedroom of his daughter, Tuqa. He called out for her to go to bed. At 21, Tuqa would often stay up late, and though Basim knew that he wasn\u2019t a good example himself and that the current conditions afforded little reason to be up early, he believed in the calming power of an early-to-bed, early-to-rise routine. He waited at the foot of the stairs, called out again, and the sliver went dark.\n\n  It was 1 a.m. when Basim finally shut down the computer and headed upstairs to bed. He settled in next to Mayada, who was fast asleep.\n\n  Some time later, he snapped awake. His shirt was drenched, and there was a strange taste \u2014 blood? \u2014 on his tongue. The air was thick and acrid. He looked up. He was in the bedroom, but the roof was nearly gone. He could see the night sky, the stars over Mosul. Basim reached out and found his legs pressed just inches from his face by what remained of his bed. He began to panic. He turned to his left, and there was a heap of rubble. \u201cMayada!\u201d he screamed. \u201cMayada!\u201d It was then that he noticed the silence. \u201cMayada!\u201d he shouted. \u201cTuqa!\u201d The bedroom walls were missing, leaving only the bare supports. He could see the dark outlines of treetops. He began to hear the faraway, unmistakable sound of a woman\u2019s voice. He cried out, and the voice shouted back, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d It was Azza, his sister-in-law, somewhere outside.\n\n  \u201cMayada\u2019s gone!\u201d he shouted.\n\n  \u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll find her!\u201d\n\n  \u201cNo, no, no, she\u2019s gone,\u201d he cried back. \u201cThey\u2019re all gone!\u201d\n\n  The clip is one of hundreds the coalition has released since the American-led war against the Islamic State began in August 2014. Also posted to Defense Department websites, they are presented as evidence of a military campaign unlike any other \u2014 precise, transparent and unyielding. In the effort to expel ISIS from Iraq and Syria, the coalition has conducted more than 27,500 strikes to date, deploying everything from Vietnam-era B-52 bombers to modern Predator drones. That overwhelming air power has made it possible for local ground troops to overcome heavy resistance and retake cities throughout the region. \u201cU.S. and coalition forces work very hard to be precise in airstrikes,\u201d Maj. Shane Huff, a spokesman for the Central Command, told us, and as a result \u201care conducting one of the most precise air campaigns in military history.\u201d\n\n  American military planners go to great lengths to distinguish today\u2019s precision strikes from the air raids of earlier wars, which were carried out with little or no regard for civilian casualties. They describe a target-selection process grounded in meticulously gathered intelligence, technological wizardry, carefully designed bureaucratic hurdles and extraordinary restraint. Intelligence analysts pass along proposed targets to \u201ctargeteers,\u201d who study 3-D computer models as they calibrate the angle of attack. A team of lawyers evaluates the plan, and \u2014 if all goes well \u2014 the process concludes with a strike so precise that it can, in some cases, destroy a room full of enemy fighters and leave the rest of the house intact.\n\n  The coalition usually announces an airstrike within a few days of its completion. It also publishes a monthly report assessing allegations of civilian casualties. Those it deems credible are generally explained as unavoidable accidents \u2014 a civilian vehicle drives into the target area moments after a bomb is dropped, for example. The coalition reports that since August 2014, it has killed tens of thousands of ISIS fighters and, according to our tally of its monthly summaries, 466 civilians in Iraq.\n\n  Yet until we raised his case, Basim\u2019s family was not among those counted. Mayada, Tuqa, Mohannad and Najib were four of an unknown number of Iraqi civilians whose deaths the coalition has placed in the \u201cISIS\u201d column. Estimates from Airwars and other nongovernmental organizations suggest that the civilian death toll is much higher, but the coalition disputes such figures, arguing that they are based not on specific intelligence but local news reports and testimony gathered from afar. When the coalition notes a mission irregularity or receives an allegation, it conducts its own inquiry and publishes a sentence-long analysis of its findings. But no one knows how many Iraqis have simply gone uncounted.\n\n  Our own reporting, conducted over 18 months, shows that the air war has been significantly less precise than the coalition claims. Between April 2016 and June 2017, we visited the sites of nearly 150 airstrikes across northern Iraq, not long after ISIS was evicted from them. We toured the wreckage; we interviewed hundreds of witnesses, survivors, family members, intelligence informants and local officials; we photographed bomb fragments, scoured local news sources, identified ISIS targets in the vicinity and mapped the destruction through satellite imagery. We also visited the American air base in Qatar where the coalition directs the air campaign. There, we were given access to the main operations floor and interviewed senior commanders, intelligence officials, legal advisers and civilian-casualty assessment experts. We provided their analysts with the coordinates and date ranges of every airstrike \u2014 103 in all \u2014 in three ISIS-controlled areas and examined their responses. The result is the first systematic, ground-based sample of airstrikes in Iraq since this latest military action began in 2014.\n\n  We found that one in five of the coalition strikes we identified resulted in civilian death, a rate more than 31 times that acknowledged by the coalition. It is at such a distance from official claims that, in terms of civilian deaths, this may be the least transparent war in recent American history. Our reporting, moreover, revealed a consistent failure by the coalition to investigate claims properly or to keep records that make it possible to investigate the claims at all. While some of the civilian deaths we documented were a result of proximity to a legitimate ISIS target, many others appear to be the result simply of flawed or outdated intelligence that conflated civilians with combatants. In this system, Iraqis are considered guilty until proved innocent. Those who survive the strikes, people like Basim Razzo, remain marked as possible ISIS sympathizers, with no discernible path to clear their names.\n\n  In the hospital, Basim was hazily aware of nurses and orderlies, but it was not until morning that he saw a familiar face. Mayada\u2019s brother placed a hand on his shoulder. When Basim asked who in his home survived, he was told: nobody. The blast killed Mayada and Tuqa instantly. A second strike hit next door, and Mohannad and Najib were also dead. Only Azza, Najib\u2019s mother, was alive, because the explosion had flung her through a second-story window.\n\n  With his hip shattered, his pubic bone broken and his back and the sole of his left foot studded with shrapnel, Basim would need major surgery. But no hospital in Mosul, or anywhere in the caliphate, had the personnel or equipment to carry it out. The only hope was to apply for permission to temporarily leave ISIS territory, which required approval from the surprisingly complex ISIS bureaucracy. A friend put in the paperwork, but the ISIS representative denied the request. \u201cLet him die,\u201d he told Basim\u2019s friend. \u201cThere were four martyrs. Let him be the fifth.\u201d\n\n  Basim was moved to his parents\u2019 home on the city\u2019s southern side. For two days, close friends and family members streamed in, but he hardly registered their presence. On the third day, he found himself able to sit up, and he began flipping through the pictures on his phone. One of the last was taken the evening before the attack: Tuqa grinning in the kitchen, clutching a sparkler. For the first time, he began to sob. Then he gathered himself and opened Facebook. \u201cIn the middle of the night,\u201d he wrote, \u201ccoalition airplanes targeted two houses occupied by innocent civilians. Is this technology? This barbarian attack cost me the lives of my wife, daughter, brother and nephew.\u201d\n\n  Suddenly, it was as if the whole city knew, and messages poured in. Word filtered to local sheikhs, imams and businessmen. Basim\u2019s own fate was discussed. Favors were called in, and a few weeks later, ISIS granted Basim permission to leave the caliphate. There was one condition: He must put up the deed to some of his family\u2019s property, which would be seized if he did not return. Basim feared traveling to Baghdad; whoever targeted his home might still believe him to be part of ISIS. Turkey seemed like his only option, and the only way to get there was to cross the breadth of Islamic State lands, through Syria.\n\n  For Basim, the next few days passed in a haze. A hired driver lowered him into a GMC Suburban, its rear seats removed to accommodate the mattress on which he reclined. They drove through the Islamic State countryside, past shabby villages and streams strewn with trash. In the afternoon, they reached Mount Sinjar, where a year earlier, Yazidi women were carted off by ISIS and sold into slavery. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have to go fast now,\u201d the driver said, revving up the engine until they were tearing through at 100 m.p.h. Yazidi guerrillas were now taking refuge in the highlands and were known to take aim at the traffic down below.\n\n  The country opened up into miles and miles of featureless desert. Basim could not distinguish the small Syrian towns they passed but was aware of reaching Raqqa, the capital of the caliphate, and being lifted by a team of pedestrians and moved to a second vehicle. Soon a new driver was rushing Basim along darkened fields of wheat and cotton on narrow, bone-jarring roads. At times, the pain in his hip was unbearable. They stopped to spend the night, but he did not know where. At dawn, they set out again. After a while, the driver reached under his seat and produced a pack of cigarettes, forbidden in the caliphate. Basim was alarmed, but the driver began to laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in Free Syrian Army territory.\u201d\n\n  Before long, the traffic slowed, and they were weaving through streets crowded with refugees and homeless children and Syrian rebels. Basim was pushed across the border on a wheelchair. Waiting on the Turkish side, standing by an ambulance, was his son. Weeping, Yahya bent down to embrace his father. They had not seen each other in a year.\n\n  Basim spent the next two months in and out of a bed at the Special Orthopedic Hospital in Adana, Turkey. In the long hours between operations, when the painkillers afforded moments of lucidity, he tried to avoid ruminating on his loss. He refused to look at photos of his house, but occasionally at first, and then obsessively, he began replaying his and Mayada\u2019s actions in the days and weeks before the attack, searching for an explanation. Why was his family targeted? Some friends assumed that an ISIS convoy had been nearby, but the video showed nothing moving in the vicinity. What it did show was two direct hits. \u201cO.K., this is my house, and this is Mohannad\u2019s house,\u201d he recalled. \u201cOne rocket here, and one rocket there. It was not a mistake.\u201d\n\n  Basim\u2019s shock and grief were turning to anger. He knew the Americans; he had lived among them. He had always felt he understood them. He desperately wanted to understand why his family was taken from him. \u201cI decided,\u201d he said, \u201cto get justice.\u201d\n\n  In the 1970s, as Saddam Hussein consolidated power, Mosul\u2019s pluralism began to erode, but Basim would not be around long enough to witness its disappearance. He left for England in 1979 and soon made his way to the United States. Settling into Michigan life was easy. Basim bought a Mustang, figured out health insurance, barbecued, went to cocktail parties and dated a woman he met in England. This development alarmed his parents, who began to pester him to settle down and suggested that he marry his cousin Mayada. He resisted at first, but the allure of making a life with someone from back home proved too great. He married Mayada in 1982, in a small ceremony at his uncle\u2019s home in Ann Arbor, Mich., in front of a dozen people.\n\n  As the oldest son, Basim felt increasingly concerned about his aging parents, so in 1988, he and Mayada made the difficult decision to move back home permanently. The city they returned to had undergone a shocking transformation. The Iran-Iraq war was winding down, but at a cost of as many as half a million dead Iraqis. The political alternatives of Basim\u2019s youth were gone: Communism had long since been crushed, and Arab nationalism had lost its luster under Hussein\u2019s Baathist dictatorship.\n\n  Instead, people increasingly described their suffering in the language of faith. The culture was transforming before Basim\u2019s eyes; for the first time, Mayada wrapped herself in a head scarf. Not long after, small networks of religious fundamentalists began appearing in Mosul, preaching to communities devastated by war and United Nations sanctions.\n\n  Then, in 2003, the United States invaded. One night just a few months afterward, the Americans showed up at the Woods and took over a huge abandoned military barracks across the street from Basim\u2019s property. The next morning, they started cutting down trees. \u201cThey said, \u2018This is for our security,\u2019\u2009\u201d Basim recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Your security doesn\u2019t mean destruction of the forest.\u2019\u2009\u201d Walls of concrete and concertina wire started to appear amid the pine and chinar stands. The barracks became a Joint Coordination Center, or J.C.C., where American troops worked with local security forces. Basim came to know some of the Americans; once, before the center acquired internet access, he helped a soldier send email to his mother back home. Sometimes he would serve as an impromptu translator.\n\n  Across Iraq, the American invasion had plunged the country into chaos and spawned a nationalist resistance \u2014 and amid the social collapse, the zealots seized the pulpit. Al Qaeda in Iraq recruited from Mosul\u2019s shanty towns and outlying villages and from nearby provincial cities like Tal Afar. By 2007, sections of Mosul were in rebellion. By then, the Americans had expanded the mission of the J.C.C., adding a center where Iraqis could file compensation claims for the injury or death of a loved one at the hands of American forces.\n\n  Basim was transfixed. He\u2019d never seen an American talk this way. That night, he wrote an email. \u201cDear Dr. Richards, my name is Basim Razzo, and I am a citizen of Iraq,\u201d he began. He described how Iraqis had celebrated the overthrow of Hussein but then lost hope as the war progressed. \u201cRadical Islamists grew as a result of this war, and many ideas grew out of this war which we have never seen or heard before,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank you very much for your speech to enlighten the American public about this war.\u201d\n\n  Richards invited Basim to begin speaking to his classes over Skype, and a friendship blossomed. Years later, Richards saw Basim\u2019s Facebook post describing the attack and ran it through Google Translate. He and his wife spent hours messaging with Basim, trying to console him. In the end, Richards had signed off, \u201cThis American friend of yours, this American brother, sends you a virtual hug.\u201d\n\n  Now, as Basim lay in bed in the Special Orthopedic Hospital in Adana, he found his thoughts returning to the old Joint Coordination Center next to his house in Mosul and the condolence payments they used to offer. He knew that he would never recover the full extent of his losses, but he needed to clear his name. And he wanted an accounting. He decided that as soon as he recuperated, he would seek compensation. It was the only way he could imagine that an Iraqi civilian might sit face to face with a representative of the United States military.\n\n  Because the military still refused to consider the payments as compensation for loss, the system became capricious almost by design. Rebuilding a home could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, on top of several thousands\u2019 worth of furniture and other possessions. Medical bills could amount to thousands of dollars, especially for prostheses and rehabilitation. Losing government documents, like ID cards, could mean years of navigating a lumbering bureaucracy. The American condolence system addressed none of this. Payouts varied from one unit to the next, making the whole process seem arbitrary, mystifying or downright cruel to recipients: Payouts in Afghanistan, for example, ranged from as little as $124.13 in one civilian death to $15,000 in another.\n\n  In 2003, an activist from Northern California named Marla Ruzicka showed up in Baghdad determined to overhaul the system. She founded Civic, now known as the Center for Civilians in Conflict, and collected evidence of civilians killed in American military operations. She discovered not only that there were many more than expected but also that the assistance efforts for survivors were remarkably haphazard and arbitrary. Civic championed the cause in Washington and found an ally in Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont. In 2005, Ruzicka was killed by a suicide blast in Baghdad, but her efforts culminated in legislation that established a fund to provide Iraqi victims of American combat operations with nonmonetary assistance \u2014 medical care, home reconstruction \u2014 that served, in practice, as compensation.\n\n  When the Americans withdrew in 2011, however, all condolence programs went defunct, and they were not revived when the United States began the war against ISIS in 2014. The Marla Ruzicka Iraqi War Victims Fund itself \u2014 the only program specifically designed to aid war victims still in effect \u2014 has turned to other priorities and no longer provides assistance to civilian survivors of American combat operations. When we asked the State Department whether civilian victims of American airstrikes could turn to the Marla Fund for assistance, they were unable to provide an answer.\n\n  The two most recent military spending bills also authorized millions of dollars for condolence payments, but the Defense Department has failed to enact these provisions or even propose a plan for how it might disburse that money. In fact, in the course of our investigation, we learned that not a single person in Iraq or Syria has received a condolence payment for a civilian death since the war began in 2014. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t a process,\u201d a senior Central Command official told us. \u201cIt\u2019s not that anyone is against it; it just hasn\u2019t been done, so it\u2019s almost an aspirational requirement.\u201d\n\n  With Mosul and Raqqa now out of ISIS control, the coalition is \u201cnot going to spend a lot of time thinking about\u201d condolence payments, said Col. John Thomas, a spokesman for Central Command. \u201cWe\u2019re putting our efforts into community safety and returning refugees to some sort of home.\u201d While assisting civilian victims is no longer a military priority, some authorities appear to remain concerned about retaliation. About a year after the strike on Basim\u2019s house, his cousin Hussain Al-Rizzo, a systems-engineering professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, received a visit from an F.B.I. agent. The agent, he said, asked if the deaths of his relatives in an American airstrike made him in his \u201cheart of hearts sympathize with the bad guys.\u201d Hussain, who has lived in the United States since 1987, was stunned by the question. He said no.\n\n  Basim channeled his frustrations into proving his case to the Americans. With a quiet compulsiveness, he scoured the web, studying Google Earth images. He asked a niece, still living inside Mosul, to take clandestine photographs of the site, including close-ups of bomb fragments. He inventoried his lost possessions. He contacted everyone he\u2019d met who might have links to the American authorities: acquaintances from Michigan, his cousins in Arkansas, a relative who was an assistant professor at Yale University. His best hope was Sam Richards, the professor at Penn State: One of his former students was an adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, and she helped him get an appointment at the United States Embassy in Baghdad.\n\n  The consular officer, who spoke to us on the condition of anonymity, was moved. \u201cI have people coming in every day that lie to me, that come with these sob stories,\u201d the officer remembered telling him, \u201cbut I believe you.\u201d When Basim emerged onto the street, the rain was beating down, and a passer-by held out an umbrella as he hobbled to a taxi.\n\n  Two months passed, and Basim heard nothing. He wrote to the officer and reattached the report, asking for an update, but he received no reply. He tried again the next month and was told that his case had been \u201cforwarded.\u201d Then more silence.\n\n  We first met Basim not long after, in the spring of 2016, in a quiet cafe in Baghdad\u2019s Mansour district. Basim\u2019s cousin\u2019s wife, Zareena Grewal, the Yale professor, had written an Op-Ed in The New York Times about the attack. We had already been investigating the larger problem of civilian airstrikes for several months, so we contacted him to learn more about his story. Nearly half the country was still under ISIS control, and all along Mansour\u2019s palm-shaded sidewalks were the resplendent bursts of militia flags and posters of angelic-looking young men who had fallen on the front. Around the city, residents were living under a pall of suspicion that they were Islamic State sympathizers, a target for rogue militias and vengeful security forces, and Basim was eager to move north to Erbil. This was another reason he was determined to meet the Americans \u2014 not only for compensation but also for a letter attesting to their mistake, to certify that he did not belong to ISIS. \u201cWe\u2019ll hear something soon,\u201d Basim assured us.\n\n  But as the summer months came and went, still without word, Basim\u2019s confidence began to waver. In September, nearly a year after the airstrike, he tried emailing the embassy again. This time he received a response: \u201cThe recipient\u2019s mailbox is full and can\u2019t accept messages now. Please try resending this message later, or contact the recipient directly.\u201d (The consular officer later told us that when Basim\u2019s case was referred to a military attorney, the attorney replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no way to prove that the U.S. was involved.\u201d)\n\n  In November, we wrote to the coalition ourselves, explaining that we were reporters working on an article about Basim. We provided details about his family and his efforts to reach someone in authority and included a link to the YouTube video the coalition posted immediately after the strike. A public-affairs officer responded, \u201cThere is nothing in the historical log for 20 SEP 2015,\u201d the date the coalition had assigned to the strike video. Not long after, the video disappeared from the coalition\u2019s YouTube channel. We responded by providing the GPS coordinates of Basim\u2019s home, his emails to the State Department and an archived link to the YouTube video, which unlike the videos on the Pentagon\u2019s website allow for comments underneath \u2014 including those that Basim\u2019s family members left nearly a year before.\n\n  \u201cI will NEVER forget my innocent and dear cousins who died in this pointless airstrike,\u201d wrote Aisha Al-Rizzo, Tuqa\u2019s 16-year-old cousin from Arkansas.\n\n  \u201cYou are murderers,\u201d wrote Basim and Mohannad\u2019s cousin Hassan al-Razzo. \u201cYou kill innocents with cold blood and then start creating justification.\u201d\n\n  \u201cHow could you do that?\u201d wrote another relative. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a heart.\u201d\n\n  Over the coming weeks, one by one, the coalition began removing all the airstrike videos from YouTube.\nWhen ISIS left a mortar in Qaiyara\u2019s rail yard, a local informant passed on the coordinates for an airstrike. The strikes hit the rail yard (below), but ISIS had moved on. Instead, the homes of Salam al-Odeh and Aaz-Aldin Muhammad Alwan were hit. Salam\u2019s wife, Harbia, hung on until she reached the hospital, where she told her relatives what happened, then died of her injuries. A few weeks later, her son Musab died of his wounds, too. Of the eight people living in the two homes struck, only Rawa (below), who was 2, survived.\n  When we visited in May, several uniformed officials walked us through the steps they took to avoid civilian casualties. The process seemed staggeringly complex \u2014 the wall-to-wall monitors, the soup of acronyms, the army of lawyers \u2014 but the impressively choreographed operation was designed to answer two basic questions about each proposed strike: Is the proposed target actually ISIS? And will attacking this ISIS target harm civilians in the vicinity?\n\n  As we sat around a long conference table, the officers explained how this works in the best-case scenario, when the coalition has weeks or months to consider a target. Intelligence streams in from partner forces, informants on the ground, electronic surveillance and drone footage. Once the coalition decides a target is ISIS, analysts study the probability that striking it will kill civilians in the vicinity, often by poring over drone footage of patterns of civilian activity. The greater the likelihood of civilian harm, the more mitigating measures the coalition takes. If the target is near an office building, the attack might be rescheduled for nighttime. If the area is crowded, the coalition might adjust its weaponry to limit the blast radius. Sometimes aircraft will even fire a warning shot, allowing people to escape targeted facilities before the strike. An official showed us grainy night-vision footage of this technique in action: Warning shots hit the ground near a shed in Deir al-Zour, Syria, prompting a pair of white silhouettes to flee, one tripping and picking himself back up, as the cross hairs follow.\n\n  Once the targeting team establishes the risks, a commander must approve the strike, taking care to ensure that the potential civilian harm is not \u201cexcessive relative to the expected military advantage gained,\u201d as Lt. Col. Matthew King, the center\u2019s deputy legal adviser, explained.\n\n  After the bombs drop, the pilots and other officials evaluate the strike. Sometimes a civilian vehicle can suddenly appear in the video feed moments before impact. Or, through studying footage of the aftermath, they might detect signs of a civilian presence. Either way, such a report triggers an internal assessment in which the coalition determines, through a review of imagery and testimony from mission personnel, whether the civilian casualty report is credible. If so, the coalition makes refinements to avoid future civilian casualties, they told us, a process that might include reconsidering some bit of intelligence or identifying a flaw in the decision-making process.\n\n  Most of the civilian deaths acknowledged by the coalition emerge from this internal reporting process. Often, though, watchdogs or journalists bring allegations to the coalition, or officials learn about potential civilian deaths through social media. The coalition ultimately rejects a vast majority of such external reports. It will try to match the incident to a strike in its logs to determine whether it was indeed its aircraft that struck the location in question (the Iraqi Air Force also carries out strikes). If so, it then scours its drone footage, pilot videos, internal records and, when they believe it is warranted, social media and other open-source information for corroborating evidence. Each month, the coalition releases a report listing those allegations deemed credible, dismissing most of them on the grounds that coalition aircraft did not strike in the vicinity or that the reporter failed to provide sufficiently precise information about the time and place of the episode. (The coalition counts both aircraft and artillery attacks in its strike figures; we excluded artillery attacks.)\n\n  In the eyes of the coalition, its diligence on these matters points to a dispiriting truth about war: Supreme precision can reduce civilian casualties to a very small number, but that number will never reach zero. They speak of every one of the acknowledged deaths as tragic but utterly unavoidable. \u201cWe\u2019re not happy with it, and we\u2019re never going to be happy with it,\u201d said Thomas, the Central Command spokesman. \u201cBut we\u2019re pretty confident we do the best we can to try to limit these things.\u201d\n\n  The coalition sees the same problem but draws the opposite conclusion. In a September opinion article in Foreign Policy, with the headline \u201cReports of Civilian Casualties in the War Against ISIS Are Vastly Inflated,\u201d Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the coalition\u2019s former top commander, wrote: \u201cOur critics are unable to conduct the detailed assessments the coalition does. They arguably often rely on scant information phoned in or posted by questionable sources.\u201d\n\n  Counting civilian deaths in war zones has always been a difficult and controversial endeavor. The Iraq Body Count project, which sought to record civilian deaths after the 2003 invasion using techniques similar to Airwars, was flooded with criticism for both undercounting and overcounting. The Lancet, a medical journal, published studies based on surveys of Iraqi households that detractors alleged were not statistically sound. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have conducted ground investigations, but usually for only a handful of strikes at a time. Yet the coalition, the institution best placed to investigate civilian death claims, does not itself routinely dispatch investigators on the ground, citing access and security concerns, meaning there has not been such a rigorous ground investigation of this air war \u2014 or any American-led air campaign \u2014 since Human Rights Watch analyzed the civilian toll of the NATO bombing in Kosovo, a conflict that ended in 1999.\n\n  In our interview at the base, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of the United States Air Forces Central Command at Udeid, told us what was missing. \u201cGround truth, that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking for,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see what we see from altitude and pull in from other reports. Your perspective is talking to people on the ground.\u201d He paused, and then offered what he thought it would take to arrive at the truth: \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a combination of both.\u201d\nIn early 2016, an ISIS patrol forced its way into the home of Rafi al-Iraqi (below, with his children), demanding the family\u2019s cellphones. Sama (right), Rafi\u2019s 10-year-old daughter, burst into tears and produced her mother\u2019s phone, which contained negative messages about ISIS that she had recently sent to her sister in Erbil. Rafi and his wife were arrested and interrogated, but only he was released. When Rafi asked about his wife, he was told, \u201cWe\u2019ll bring her to you.\u201d Not long after, the family received her bullet-riddled body. Almost precisely a year later, at the height of the Mosul offensive, an airstrike leveled Rafi\u2019s house and two others next door. Only Rafi, his mother and his 12-year-old son, Mohammed (far left), survived.\n  The areas we visited had undergone intense attacks of all kinds over the previous two years: airstrikes, sniper fire, mortars, rockets, improvised explosive devices, demolitions by ISIS, demolitions by anti-ISIS vigilantes and more. Our approach required mapping each area, identifying the sites that had been struck from the air and excluding those damaged by Iraqi forces in close-quarters ground combat.\n\n  Finally, we determined who or what had been hit. In addition to interviewing hundreds of witnesses, we dug through the debris for bomb fragments, tracked down videos of airstrikes in the area and studied before-and-after satellite imagery. We also obtained and analyzed more than 100 coordinate sets for suspected ISIS sites passed on by intelligence informants. We then mapped each neighborhood door to door, identifying houses where ISIS members were known to have lived and locating ISIS facilities that could be considered legitimate targets. We scoured the wreckage of each strike for materials suggesting an ISIS presence, like weapons, literature and decomposed remains of fighters. We verified every allegation with local administrators, security forces or health officials.\n\n  In Qaiyara\u2019s residential district, where small wheat-colored homes sit behind low concrete walls, one or two structures had been reduced to rubble on almost every block. We went to all of them. A significant part of our efforts involved determining which air force \u2014 Iraqi or coalition \u2014 carried out each strike. Either way, according to official accounts, the air war in Qaiyara was remarkably precise: The coalition has stated that it killed only one civilian in or near the town, while the Iraqi Air Force has not acknowledged any civilian deaths in the area.\n\n  It was soon clear that many more had died. We visited one house that stood partly intact but for the rear alcove, which had been pancaked. A woman stepped out from the front of the structure, three children orbiting her. She told us her name, Inas Hamadi. \u201cMy children died here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt happened so quickly.\u201d One of the surviving children, Wiham, 11, remembered waking up to the sound of aircraft and running under the stairs to hide with her six siblings and cousins. Then the house was struck, collapsing the staircase onto them. Riam, 8, and Daoud, 5, did not survive. \u201cDaoud\u2019s body was full of shrapnel,\u201d Wiham said. \u201cRiam had a hole beside her ear and a hole in her brain. She looked around and was dizzy.\u201d\n\n  The strike was witnessed by neighbors, who helped rescue the children. Everyone agreed that the target was most likely the hospital or a pair of homes on the next street, all of which had been commandeered by ISIS. We collected the names and photographs of the dead and checked satellite imagery to confirm the date range of the strike. The deaths were never reported, were never recorded in any public database and were not investigated by the coalition.\n\n  We continued in this fashion, door to door. What we found was sobering: During the two years that ISIS ruled downtown Qaiyara, an area of about one square mile, there were 40 airstrikes, 13 of which killed 43 civilians \u2014 19 men, eight women and 16 children, ages 14 or younger. In the same period, according to the Iraqi federal police, ISIS executed 18 civilians in downtown Qaiyara.\n\n  In Shura and Aden, we found a similar discrepancy between the number of civilian deaths on the ground and the number reported by the coalition. Through dozens of interviews at each site in all three locations, along with our house-to-house mapping, we tried to determine the reasons behind each airstrike that killed civilians. Coalition officials say ISIS fighters embedded in the population, making it difficult to avoid hitting civilians nearby. This appeared to be the case for about one-third of the deadly strikes \u2014 for example, a September 2016 strike on an ISIS-occupied primary school in Shura that killed three civilians in the vicinity.\n\n  But in about half of the strikes that killed civilians, we could find no discernible ISIS target nearby. Many of these strikes appear to have been based on poor or outdated intelligence. For example, last fall we visited a bombed-out house on the edge of Qaiyara, near the rail yard. It belonged to the family of Salam al-Odeh; neighbors and relatives told us the family had been sleeping one night when they awoke to the shudder of an airstrike nearby. Sometimes strikes came in pairs, so Salam\u2019s wife, Harbia, scooped up their baby, Bara, and ran out the door. Salam scrambled to save his other children \u2014 his daughter, Rawa, and his sons, Musab and Hussein. But then a second strike hit. Salam, the baby and Hussein were killed instantly. His wife hung on until she reached the hospital, where she told her relatives what happened, but then died from her injuries. A few weeks later, Musab died of his wounds too. Only Rawa, who was 2, survived. Several months later, we found the person who called in the strike, one of the coalition\u2019s main sources in Qaiyara, a local Iraqi official we are not identifying for his safety. He told us that while on a walk one day, he spotted an ISIS mortar under a clump of trees near the rail yard and transmitted the coordinates. (Neighbors also told us that ISIS had occupied and then abandoned a house in the area a year earlier, which a different informant may have told the coalition about.) By the time the information made its way to the coalition and it decided to act, the mortar had been moved.\n\n  Such intelligence failures suggest that not all civilian casualties are unavoidable tragedies; some deaths could be prevented if the coalition recognizes its past failures and changes its operating assumptions accordingly. But in the course of our investigation, we found that it seldom did either.\n\n  In June, for example, we visited an electrical substation occupying several blocks of the Aden neighborhood in eastern Mosul. On the evening of April 20, 2015, aircraft bombed the station, causing a tremendous explosion that engulfed the street. Muthana Ahmed Tuaama, a university student, told us his brother rushed into the blaze to rescue the wounded, when a second blast shook the facility. \u201cI found my brother at the end of the street,\u201d he said. \u201cI carried him.\u201d Body parts littered the alleyway. \u201cYou see those puddles of water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just like that, but full of blood.\u201d We determined that at least 18 civilians died in this one attack and that many more were grievously wounded. News of the strike was picked up by local bloggers, national Iraqi outlets and ISIS propaganda channels and was submitted as an allegation to the coalition by Airwars. Months later, the coalition announced the results of its investigation, stating that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to find that civilians were harmed in this strike.\u201d Yet even a cursory internet search offers significant evidence that civilians were harmed: We found disturbingly graphic videos of the strike\u2019s aftermath on YouTube, showing blood-soaked toddlers and children with their legs ripped off.\n\n  A key part of the coalition\u2019s investigation process is to match civilian casualty accusations against its own logs. Chris Umphres, an Air Force captain at Udeid who assesses allegations of civilian casualties, told us that military investigators possess the coordinates of \u201cevery single strike conducted by coalition forces,\u201d crucial information unavailable to the typical journalist. \u201cWe have 100 percent accountability of where all of our weapons are employed.\u201d\n\n  We found this to not always be the case. For every location we visited, we submitted GPS coordinates to determine whether it was the coalition or the Iraqi Air Force that bombed the site. At first, the coalition told us it did not have the time or the staff to check more than a handful of the coordinates. But eventually, a team of Air Force analysts at Udeid agreed to compare the dates and coordinates of each of the 103 sites in our sample with those the coalition had recorded in its airstrike log. If a strike in our sample occurred within 50 meters of a strike that was recorded in the logs, they classified it as a \u201cprobable coalition airstrike,\u201d while assessing those outside this range \u2014 that is, anything more than a couple of house-lengths away \u2014 as \u201cunlikely.\u201d\n\n  By this measure, 30 of the 103 strike sites in the sample we submitted are probable coalition strikes. But other evidence suggests that the coalition was responsible for many more. Human rights organizations have repeatedly found discrepancies between the dates or locations of strikes and those recorded in the logs. In one instance, the coalition deemed an allegation regarding a strike in the Al-Thani neighborhood of Tabqa, Syria, on Dec. 20, 2016, as \u201cnot credible,\u201d explaining that the nearest airstrike was more than a kilometer away. After Human Rights Watch dispatched researchers to the ground and discovered evidence to the contrary, the coalition acknowledged the strike as its own.\n\n  We found many such discrepancies. For instance, the Air Force analysts said it was unlikely that the coalition had struck Qaiyara\u2019s water-sanitation facility because the logs recorded the nearest strike as 600 meters away, which would place it outside the compound entirely. Yet we discovered a video \u2014 uploaded by the coalition itself \u2014 showing a direct strike on that very facility. (When we asked Lt. Col. Damien Pickart, director of public affairs at Udeid, about this discrepancy, he said he could only report \u201cwhat the strike log shows.\u201d) Similarly, we were told that a strike we identified on Qaiyara\u2019s main bridge was unlikely to be by the coalition, because the nearest strike was on a truck 150 meters away. We again found a coalition video showing a direct hit on the structure. Pickart explained the inconsistency by saying the coalition had conducted multiple strikes on various targets within an hourlong period, only one of which was included in the official log.\n\n  The most common justification the coalition gives when denying civilian casualty allegations is that it has no record of carrying out a strike at the time or area in question. If incomplete accounts like these are standard practice, it calls into question the coalition\u2019s ability to determine whether any strike is its own. Still, even using the most conservative rubric and selecting only those 30 airstrikes the Air Force analysts classified as \u201cprobable\u201d coalition airstrikes, we found at least 21 civilians had been killed in six strikes. Expanding to the 65 strikes that fell within 600 meters \u2014 for example, the strikes on the home of Inas Hamadi in Qaiyara and the electrical substation in Aden \u2014 pushed that figure to at least 54 killed in 15 strikes. No matter which threshold we used, though, the results from our sample were consistent: One of every five airstrikes killed a civilian.\n\n  To understand how radically different our assessment is from the coalition\u2019s own, consider this: According to the coalition\u2019s available data, 89 of its more than 14,000 airstrikes in Iraq have resulted in civilian deaths, or about one of every 157 strikes. The rate we found on the ground \u2014 one out of every five \u2014 is 31 times as high.\n\n  Basim\u2019s case had now become impossible to ignore. Based on the evidence we provided, Maj. Gen. Scott Kindsvater, then an Air Force deputy commander, ordered an internal investigation to determine what might have gone wrong on the night of the strike. And then, on Feb. 14, for the first time in the 17 months since the attack, Basim received an email from the coalition. \u201cWe deeply regret this unintentional loss of life in an attempt to defeat Da\u2019esh,\u201d Scrocca wrote, using another term for ISIS. \u201cWe are prepared to offer you a monetary expression of our sympathy and regret for this unfortunate incident.\u201d He invited Basim to come to Erbil to discuss the matter. Basim was the first person to receive such an offer, in Iraq or Syria, during the entire anti-ISIS war.\n\n  Early in the morning of his scheduled meeting, Basim dreamed about Mayada. He could feel her skin next to his. He suddenly felt a surge of regret for things said and left unsaid, accrued over a lifetime together. He awoke in tears. \u201cI washed my face,\u201d he said, \u201cdid my morning prayer and sent her my prayers. It made me calmer.\u201d\n\n  It was March 17. The air outside was soft and cool; Erbil had finally experienced rainfall after a parched winter. The coalition had asked Basim to go to Erbil International Airport, where he would be picked up and taken to meet coalition representatives and receive a condolence payment. He invited us to join him, and we agreed. Basim did not know how much money the Americans would offer, but he had spent hours calculating the actual damages: $500,000 for his and Mohannad\u2019s homes, furnishings and belongings; $22,000 for two cars; and $13,000 in medical bills from Turkey. We stood waiting in the parking lot. A white S.U.V. with tinted windows rolled by. A family emerged from a taxi, the father juggling two suitcases and a toddler, heading off on what appeared to be a vacation.\n\n  Basim checked his phone to see the latest messages from friends in Mosul. It had been a month since Iraqi forces seized the eastern half of the city, but the Woods were still too dangerous to visit because ISIS controlled the opposite bank and was lobbing mortars across the river. On the west side, thousands were trapped in the Old City, and Basim heard stories that ISIS was welding doors shut to keep people in their homes, holding them hostage against heavy artillery and air power. That morning, an airstrike flattened almost an entire city block in the Mosul Jidideh neighborhood \u2014 killing 105 civilians, according to the coalition, or possibly double that number, according to Airwars, in either case making it one of the largest aerial massacres since the war began.\n\n  It was late afternoon, 30 minutes past the meeting time, when an S.U.V. rolled up, an American in Army fatigues behind the wheel. We climbed in, and the truck moved off through the sprawling airfield, past rows of parked helicopters, toward a set of hangars. Basim struggled to maintain his composure. He\u2019d imagined this day a hundred times, but now he wasn\u2019t sure what to say, how to act. The driver made small talk about the weather, the winter drought, the needs of farmers. He pulled the truck around to a prefab trailer ringed by blast walls. Inside, sitting around a large wooden table, were more American soldiers. Capt. Jaclyn Feeney, an Army attorney, introduced herself and invited Basim to be seated.\n\n  \u201cWe just wanted to start by expressing our deepest sympathies, not only on behalf of the Army but on behalf of myself,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do take the closest care in what we do here, but it\u2019s high risk, and sometimes we make mistakes. We try our best to prevent those mistakes, but we hope that since we did make a mistake here, we can do everything that we can to right it, as best we can. I know there\u2019s nothing that I can say that can make up for the loss that you\u2019ve \u2014 \u201d\n\n  \u201cThe only thing that cannot be returned is the loss of life,\u201d Basim said. His hands gripped the armrests, as if he were using every ounce of energy to stay seated. He struggled to keep his voice steady. \u201cEverything else could be redone or rebuilt. The loss of life is unrepairable.\u201d\n\n  \u201cCertainly. We are prepared to offer you a condolence payment,\u201d Feeney replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to recompensate you for what you\u2019ve lost, or for rebuilding or anything like that. It\u2019s just meant to be an expression of our sympathy, our apologies for your loss.\u201d\n\n  Outside, a plane lifted off, and the room trembled. Feeney was holding documents in her hand. \u201cAnd so for that reason, we are capped in the amount that we can give you. So the amount in U.S. dollars is $15,000, which we will be paying you in Iraqi dinars, so 17,550,000 dinars. And so, if you\u2019re willing to accept that \u2014 \u201d\n\n  Basim looked at her in disbelief. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n  \u201cYou\u2019re not willing to accept that?\u201d\n\n  \u201cThis is \u2014 this is an insult to me. No, I will not accept it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n  Feeney looked stunned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry also,\u201d she said.\n\n  Moments passed, and everyone sat in silence. Feeney explained again that they were capped by their own regulations. Basim replied, \u201cThis is, I have to say, I\u2019m sorry to say, ridiculous.\u201d Basim said he wanted official documentation proving his innocence, so that he could return safely to Mosul one day. Feeney promised to make some calls. The meeting quickly came to an end.\n\n  Basim walked out into the late-afternoon air. Traffic at the airport had picked up: buses overloaded with families, children sticking their elbows out of taxis. Basim drove home in disbelief, as if he were living through an elaborate hoax and the Americans would call back any minute with a serious offer. The truth was, he never expected to recover the full extent of his material losses, and he knew the military was not in the business of compensation, only condolence, but after so many months, so much back and forth, the humiliation burned. \u201cThis is what an Iraqi is worth,\u201d he said.\n\n  At home, he considered his options. He wanted a lawyer \u2014 but from where? Could an Iraqi find an American attorney? The amount the coalition had offered exceeded its own guidelines, which stipulated $2,500 per Iraqi, but did not cover Mohannad and Najib, which meant he \u2014 or his sister-in-law \u2014 would potentially have to endure this process again. He considered traveling to the United States to find an advocate, but getting a visa was almost impossible. Once, in the first months after the attack, he even wanted to move there, seek asylum. Now the thought seemed absurd.\n\n  Despite everything, Basim could not bring himself to hate Americans. In fact, this experience was further evidence for a theory he had harbored for a while: that he, fellow Iraqis and even ordinary Americans were all bit players in a drama bigger than any of them. A few weeks later, he spoke to Sociology 119, Sam Richards\u2019s Race and Ethnic Relations class at Penn State. \u201cI have nothing against the regular American citizen,\u201d he told the class of some 750 students. \u201cI lived among you guys for eight years. I was never bothered by any person \u2014 in fact, many of them were very helpful to me.\u201d\n\n  \u201cThis situation of war,\u201d he continued, \u201cbig corporations are behind it.\u201d This is where the real power lay, not with individual Americans. He\u2019d come to believe that his family, along with all Iraqis, had been caught in the grinder of grand forces like oil and empire, and that the only refuge lay in something even grander: faith. He had rediscovered his religion. \u201cThere was some bond that grew between me and my God. I thanked him for keeping my son alive. I thanked him that my operation was successful. Now I can walk.\u201d\n\n  It was the same God who had written out his whole life from the 40th day in the womb. Basim\u2019s faith in this divinely authored fate had become a calming current, coursing through his every waking moment. \u201cSometimes I go out with my friends,\u201d Basim told the students. \u201cBut when I come back home, when I go to bed and thoughts start coming into my head about my wife, what would have happened probably five years from now, my daughter would be in college, she wanted to study this and that \u2014 there isn\u2019t a day that goes by that I don\u2019t think about them. But in the end, life goes on.\u201d\nAhmed al-Layla tried to persuade his parents to escape from Mosul with his sister, Eaman, and join him in Erbil, but they were stubborn. His father, Mohammed Tayeb al-Layla (below left), a former dean of engineering at Mosul University, refused to abandon his prized library, shelf after shelf of books on engineering and soil mechanics. As the Iraqi Army approached, neighbors told us, several ISIS fighters broke into the home, climbed to the roof and assumed sniper positions. Ahmed\u2019s father raced up in pursuit, with Ahmed\u2019s mother, Dr. Fatima Habbal (below right), a prominent gynecologist, close behind. Not long after, an airstrike flattened the home, killing the snipers, along with Ahmed\u2019s parents and sister.\n  Next, according to the report, the coalition dispatched a drone to surveil the property. Over three days, in 15-to-30-minute windows, his house was filmed. The investigation acknowledged that \u201cno overtly nefarious activity was observed,\u201d but nonetheless everything the coalition witnessed confirmed its conviction that it was filming a terrorist headquarters. No weapons were visible, but the report noted that ISIS \u201cdoes not obviously brandish weapons,\u201d so as to go undetected. Occasionally Basim or Mohannad would open their shared gate to the street, allowing a guest to enter. The coalition simply saw men opening a gate, an action that it determined was consistent with the activity of an ISIS headquarters. And, perhaps most important, the report stated that the coalition did not observe any women or children outdoors \u2014 although in the ISIS-controlled city, women rarely left the house to avoid the religious police, and most filming had occurred under the blistering afternoon sun, when almost everyone stayed indoors.\n\n  Though the Razzos hadn\u2019t known it, the burden of proof had been on them to demonstrate to a drone watching them from above that they were civilians \u2014 guilty until proved innocent. In the end, 95 minutes of unremarkable footage had sealed the fate of Mayada, Tuqa, Mohannad and Najib. The report concluded that there was \u201cno evidence indicating carelessness or bad faith\u201d on the part of the coalition and that its targeting process \u201cremains sound.\u201d (It also declared that because of an equipment error, the drone footage no longer existed for investigators to review.) Yet to Basim, the truth seemed just the opposite: The coalition had disregarded ground realities and acted on flimsy intelligence.\n\n  Not long after receiving the report, Basim decided to return to the Woods. It was risky to visit \u2014 ISIS was still controlling neighborhoods on the opposite bank \u2014 but he wanted to see, to touch, what was left, and he took us along. We set out in the early morning, driving past dusty abandoned villages, through checkpoints sporting brilliant hoists of red, blue and green militia flags and onto a broad boulevard, teeming with pushcart vendors and street children. Whole city blocks were flattened. Basim was not caught off guard by the destruction, which he expected based on the videos he\u2019d seen, but he was surprised by the traffic. He regarded the passing scenes as if he were a tour guide, recounting the history of each neighborhood. It appeared to be an affectation of calm, a studied attempt to withstand the torment of return, but the truth eventually surfaced. \u201cI\u2019m numb,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just numb.\u201d\n\n  We drove past more ruined buildings. Around the wreckage of one stood a concrete wall, still intact, where ISIS had painted two hands open in supplication. Basim translated the inscription: THANK GOD FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE. IF YOU DO, HE WILL GIVE YOU MORE.\n\n  We headed toward the Tigris River. As we approached, we could see the apartments, houses and minarets on the other side, still under ISIS control. And then suddenly, the city was gone. We entered the Woods, which remained a bucolic oasis. The trees were heavy with figs, apricots and lemons, and the air buzzed with mosquitoes. We pulled up to a pale yellow gate. Basim lingered outside for a moment, afraid to approach. He then opened it and stepped onto his property for the first time in 18 months. We followed him along an overgrown stone path. He stopped in front of a smashed-up wall surrounded by chunks of concrete. Rebar snaked out like hairs. \u201cThis was the laundry room,\u201d he said.\n\n  To the right stood what was once his kitchen. A faint rotten odor emerged from within. The remnants of a table and three chairs were visible. Scattered amid the shattered glass and charred metal bars were pages of recipes: Cookies & Cream Freeze, Chocolate Mousse Torte.\n\n  We moved over the rest of the debris. Marble shards, concrete blocks, several mattresses, two satellite dishes, a Spalding tennis racket, an iron, a book of equations, a bathroom sink. The backyard was intact. \u201cAt least we still have a swimming pool!\u201d Basim said, laughing absently.\n\n  He circled back to the laundry room. There he spotted in a corner, poking out of the rubble, a white platform heel. It belonged to Tuqa. \u201cI told her they were too high and that she would fall,\u201d he said. He could picture her wearing them, coming down the stairs.\nAzmat Khan is an investigative journalist and a Future of War fellow at New America and Arizona State University.

{"Headline": "Synagogue\u2019s Mix of Arts and Religion Helps Shape Jewish Life in Washington", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On a wet night in August, in a bare room in the basement of the Sixth and I synagogue, one of Washington\u2019s oldest, the comedian Joe Mande was preparing backstage for his stand-up set.\u201cIt was like an anxiety dream,\u201d said Mr. Mande, who is Jewish. \u201cI was imagining that the manager was going to be like, \u2018You have to do your Torah portion.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe what was happening.\u201dThe setting might have been unlikely in most houses of worship, but not the Sixth and I Historic Synagogue \u2014 now a centerpiece of Jewish life in the capital, where bawdy comedy sets, high-profile music acts, podcast recordings, beer tastings and book talks mix with traditional spiritual programming: Simhat Torah celebrations, regular Sabbath observances, Purim theater and five varieties of High Holy Day services.Sixth and I\u2019s High Holy Days services sell out to over 3,000 people, part of the 80,000 who visit every year \u2014 a staggering number for a small space that is just over a decade old. Sabbath services alone draw 10,000 guests each year. Around 680,000 people live in the District.\u201cWhat it is today is really the story of the inordinate amount of change we\u2019re seeing in American Jewish life,\u201d said M. Bruce Lustig, the rabbi at one of the capital\u2019s most storied synagogues, Washington Hebrew Congregation.The physical structure, too, has become an important expression of Washington\u2019s complicated and shifting demography, changing from its century-old roots as a synagogue to a black church, almost becoming a nightclub, before being restored as a synagogue \u2014 the only one in the city\u2019s center.Young Jews, Rabbi Lustig said, \u201cwant to walk to work, to where you buy food, where you pray, where you get intellectually stimulated.\u201dThe building, just blocks from a subway hub, is a kind of spiritual middle point in the city, easy to access by bike, train, car or foot.\u201cWe decided what D.C. needed was a nondenominational synagogue,\u201d Mr. Zuckerman said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t conservative; it wasn\u2019t orthodox; it wasn\u2019t reform.\u201d\u201cAmerican Jewish life,\u201d he said, \u201cis sorely in need of more alternative, open-ended and self-defining and evolving institutions.\u201dYet for all of its appeals to modern Jewish life, the Sixth and I Historic Synagogue is a logical consequence of a long and classical tradition in Washington.The most successful early entrant was the Washington Jewish Community Center, which remains a presence less than a mile north of the White House.Mr. Zuckerman and his partners reopened the building in 2004 and rebranded it as the Sixth and I Historic Synagogue. Its early years were susceptible to criticism, especially from local rabbis at synagogues with long membership rolls.\u201cI have more than once actually been named in a rabbi\u2019s sermon in D.C., pointing out that this is not a way you build community,\u201d said Esther Safran Foer, the director from 2007 to 2016. \u201cThey were afraid we were undermining the Jewish community.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have traditional services on Friday and then in the next room, 250 young Jewish professionals enjoying shabbat dinner,\u201d said Heather Moran, Sixth and I\u2019s executive director.The senior rabbi at Sixth and I, Shira Stutman, estimates that a third of those at her services are not Jewish. She said that her intent was to \u201cengage people who are marginally connected to Judaism, who have Jewish pride but whose first thought on a Friday night isn\u2019t to go to services.\u201dOne of those non-Jews, Katharina Obser, said she started going to interfaith couples workshops and Sabbath services with her husband, who is Jewish, in 2015 and has not stopped.\u201cEven if the specific liturgy isn\u2019t my liturgy,\u201d Ms. Obser, 33, said, \u201cthat space for reflection, that space for thoughtfulness is something that I value immensely and have not found in another religious setting.\u201dMs. Obser said that there was \u201ca spirituality there that I can practice that has really resonated with me.\u201dOne subject Rabbi Stutman emphasizes to all of her congregants is the effect of gentrification in the neighborhoods surrounding Sixth and I, which have become destination addresses amid the city\u2019s population boom.Washington is a study in the ways new communities interact with older ones, she said. The synagogue rents a Chinese church for services, joins with a black church for Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday services and hosts a young Muslims group, leaving her congregants more sensitive to the city\u2019s fabric.The synagogue has also been adept with the currency of celebrity.Notable speakers include Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice; Senator Elizabeth Warren; the surgeon and journalist Atul Gawande; the chef Yotam Ottolenghi; the transgender activist Caitlyn Jenner; the actresses Tina Fey and Gabourey Sidibe; and the Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg.\u201cFriends on boards of other synagogues have told me they\u2019ve loosened it up because of Sixth and I\u2019s influence,\u201d Mr. Zuckerman said.Sixth and I is \u201cthe vanguard and trendsetter\u201d in Washington Jewish life, said Rabbi Herzfeld, whose synagogue\u2019s members include several couples that met at Sixth and I.Despite its reach, Sixth and I\u2019s triumphs have not created friction with the leaders of other Jewish institutions. The Jewish Community Center\u2019s director, Carole Zawatsky, is regular breakfast partners with Ms. Moran.\u201cWe complement each other and enhance each other,\u201d Ms. Zawatsky said. \u201cA robust Jewish community is now part of what D.C. is.\u201dAnd Sixth and I\u2019s pull is not limited to its neighbors.\u201cThe kinds of things that have been done at Sixth and I are a model for what can be done at a Jewish community center,\u201d said Doron Krakow, the president and chief executive of the Jewish Community Center Association of North America, which is based in New York. Mr. Krakow says he thinks of Sixth and I as precisely what has made Jewish institutions more appealing to an urban-dwelling set: letting young Jews live and pray in the same small radius.\u201cJewish community centers have been born or reborn to respond to precisely that dynamic,\u201d he said.Washington\u2019s traditional synagogues have capitalized, too. A decade ago, Rabbi Lustig was worried about the resources his synagogue had to attract young Jews. Now, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re busting at the seams,\u201d with millenial-targeted events oversubscribed \u2014 another indication of the attendant riches of a wave of religious 20-somethings moving to the capital.Adas Israel, a synagogue that used to be housed in Sixth and I\u2019s building, now counts many young Sixth and I participants among its members.Sixth and I is \u201cblowing up Jewish ideas into new dimensions,\u201d said Lauren Holtzblatt, a rabbi at Adas Israel. She recently ran the synagogue\u2019s mindfulness center, which includes meditation, yoga and \u201csoulful\u201d Sabbath services.For the more established synagogues like hers, Rabbi Holtzblatt said, Sixth and I, only notionally a synagogue, can be instructive even for the most conventional places of worship.\u201cThey form intimate Jewish communities in a place that claims not to have a Jewish community,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On YouTube Kids, Startling Videos Slip Past Filters", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a typical night in Staci Burns\u2019s house outside Fort Wayne, Ind. She was cooking dinner while her 3-year-old son, Isaac, watched videos on the YouTube Kids app on an iPad. Suddenly he cried out, \u201cMommy, the monster scares me!\u201dWhen Ms. Burns walked over, Isaac was watching a video featuring crude renderings of the characters from \u201cPAW Patrol,\u201d a Nickelodeon show that is popular among preschoolers, screaming in a car. The vehicle hurtled into a light pole and burst into flames.\u201cMy initial response was anger,\u201d said Ms. Burns, a nurse, who credits the app with helping Isaac to learn colors and letters before other boys his age. \u201cMy poor little innocent boy, he\u2019s the sweetest thing, and then there are these horrible, horrible, evil people out there that just get their kicks off of making stuff like this to torment children.\u201dBut the app contains dark corners, too, as videos that are disturbing for children slip past its filters, either by mistake or because bad actors have found ways to fool the YouTube Kids algorithms.Malik Ducard, YouTube\u2019s global head of family and learning content, said that the inappropriate videos were \u201cthe extreme needle in the haystack,\u201d but that \u201cmaking the app family friendly is of the utmost importance to us.\u201dWhile the offending videos are a tiny fraction of YouTube Kids\u2019 universe, they are another example of the potential for abuse on digital media platforms that rely on computer algorithms, rather than humans, to police the content that appears in front of people \u2014 in this case, very young people.Mr. Ducard said that while YouTube Kids may highlight some content, like Halloween videos in October, \u201cit isn\u2019t a curated experience.\u201d Instead, \u201cparents are in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d he said, pointing to the ability to block channels, set usage timers and disable search results.Parents are also encouraged to report inappropriate videos, which someone at YouTube then manually reviews, he said. He noted that in the past 30 days, \u201cless than .005 percent\u201d of the millions of videos viewed in the app were removed for being inappropriate.\u201cWe strive,\u201d he added, \u201cto make that fraction even lower.\u201dHolly Hart of Gray, Tenn., said she was recently reading while her 3-year-old daughter was in the room when she noticed that Disney Junior characters in the video her daughter was watching started \u201cturning into monsters and trying to feed each other to alligators.\u201d An image previewing a recommended video showed the characters in a provocative pose.\u201cIt was an eye-opener for me,\u201d said Ms. Hart, who had downloaded the app because it was being used at the local elementary school.Most of the videos flagged by parents were uploaded to YouTube in recent months by anonymous users with names like Kids Channel TV and Super Moon TV. The videos\u2019 titles and descriptions feature popular character names and terms like \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201clearn colors.\u201dThey are independently animated, presumably to avoid copyright violations and detection. Some clips uploaded as recently as August have millions of views on the main YouTube site and run automatically placed ads, suggesting they are financially lucrative for the makers as well as YouTube, which shares in ad revenue. It is not clear how many of those views came on YouTube Kids.The Super Ares TV account seems to be linked to a number of other channels targeting children with cartoon imitations, based on their similar channel fonts, animation style and Greek mythology-inspired names, from Super Hermes TV and Super Apollo TV to Super Hera TV.Dr. Michael Rich, a pediatrics professor at Harvard Medical School and the director of the Center on Media and Child Health, said such videos brought up a host of issues for children. \u201cIt\u2019s just made that much more upsetting by the fact that characters they thought they knew and trusted are behaving in these ways,\u201d he said.Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, argued that inappropriate videos on YouTube Kids showed hazards of today\u2019s media reality.Google has largely defended its errors by pointing to the enormous amount of content it hosts, including more than 400 hours of content uploaded to YouTube every minute.Disney and Nickelodeon, mainstays of children\u2019s programming, work with YouTube Kids to introduce children to their characters. But they are also aware that their content can be mixed in with disturbing knockoffs.\u201cNickelodeon creates its characters and shows to entertain kids, so we share the same concern as parents about the unsuitable nature of some of the videos being served to them,\u201d said David Bittler, a spokesman for the Viacom-owned network.A Disney spokesman said YouTube Kids had assured the company that it was \u201cworking on ways to more effectively and proactively prevent this type of situation from occurring.\u201dSome parents have taken to deleting the app. Others, like Ms. Burns, still allow its use, just on a more limited, supervised basis.\u201cThis is a children\u2019s application \u2014 it\u2019s targeted to children,\u201d said Crissi Gilreath, a mother of two in Oklahoma, \u201cand I just can\u2019t believe that with such a big company they don\u2019t have people whose job it is to filter and flag.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Force Young Girls to Hug Their Relatives, the Girl Scouts Say", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen relatives and guests make an appearance this holiday season, do not force your daughters to hug them. That\u2019s the latest advice from the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A.\u201cThink of it this way, telling your child that she owes someone a hug either just because she hasn\u2019t seen this person in a while or because they gave her a gift can set the stage for her questioning whether she \u2018owes\u2019 another person any type of physical affection when they\u2019ve bought her dinner or done something else seemingly nice for her later in life.\u201d\u201cNo girl is going to seriously think she has to get physical with a guy to be polite, just because she had to give Aunt Betty a hug at Christmas when she was little,\u201d said one reader, Angelique McKowan.Another parent, Jennifer Davis-Batista, wrote: \u201cIf an adult is seriously offended by a CHILD not feeling comfortable with a hug, they need to grow up. Of course we all want our kids to be loving and kind. But doing something that doesn\u2019t feel right to them just because an adult wants you to is wrong.\u201dThe Girl Scouts said that its advice on opting out of hugs was not meant to be portrayed as a \u201clicense to be rude.\u201d But it emphasized that there were ways other than physical contact to show gratitude and love.\u201cSaying how much she\u2019s missed someone or thank you with a smile, a high-five, or even an air kiss are all ways she can express herself, and it\u2019s important that she knows she gets to choose which feels most comfortable to her,\u201d it said.The Girl Scouts regularly publishes statements and blog posts on its website about topics that might interest girls in their development as future leaders, from the importance of voting to how to recover from natural disasters.The post had outsize reach, generating interest far beyond the organization\u2019s membership of more than 1.8 million girls and their families.On social media, the hugs post was widely shared. Some readers wondered how the conversation would play out across a diverse culture of Americans, suggesting that some ethnic groups are believed to be more emotionally demonstrative.In the emailed statement on Wednesday, the Girl Scouts responded to some of the criticism: \u201cObviously, our advice will not apply in all situations, and we recognize that parents and caregivers are in the best position to judge which conversations they should have with their girls.\u201dDr. Andrea Bastiani Archibald, the Girl Scouts\u2019 developmental psychologist, said in the post that it was never too early to start the conversation about consent with girls.\u201cThe notion of consent may seem very grown-up and like something that doesn\u2019t pertain to children,\u201d she said.\u201cPlus, sadly, we know that some adults prey on children, and teaching your daughter about consent early on can help her understand her rights, know when lines are being crossed, and when to go to you for help,\u201d she said.The gist, the Girl Scouts added, was that girls need to be given the space to decide when and how they want to show affection. \u201cOf course, many children may naturally want to hug and kiss family members, friends, and neighbors, and that\u2019s lovely \u2014 but if your daughter is reticent, don\u2019t force her,\u201d the organization said.But Sharon Lamb, a professor of counseling and school psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, said in an interview that the Girl Scouts\u2019 advice might be expecting too much of young children to figure out their own boundaries.\u201cThere is a little bit of pushing kids to taking care of themselves and set their own boundaries,\u201d Dr. Lamb said.She said that having a general no-hugs policy could remove an opportunity for parents to find out whether there are deeper meanings to a child\u2019s hesitation.\"Coming with up a rule should not take the place of figuring out what\u2019s up with your child, and whether that child is just shy and doesn\u2019t like hugs, or whether they don\u2019t like this relative, or something else is going on,\u201d Dr. Lamb said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Old and Lonely in New India", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorKOLKATA, India \u2014 Once when I was searching for old-age homes in Kolkata for a story, my mother said sardonically: \u201cLook around you. The whole neighborhood has become an old-age home.\u201d It was an exaggeration but not by much.The old man down the street was recovering from a knee replacement. The elderly lady across from him spent her days in her nightgown feeding the neighborhood\u2019s stray dogs. The children were gone \u2014 to the United States and Australia, to Bengaluru and Mumbai. When my sister went to pay our property taxes she found a separate line for seniors. It was pointless. Almost everyone there was a senior.My mother had grown up as one of 30-odd cousins, all living in one sprawling house. In the morning they would leave their soaps outside the common bathroom to mark their place in the line. On holiday afternoons they would crowd onto their grandmother\u2019s bed. It was not a very big bed but somehow they all fit. Only a few of the next generation still live in Kolkata. The others return for weddings and funerals.When I lived in the United States, my immigrant friends would always say their dream was to retire in India. The magnetic lure of the dollar had pulled them to the United States. In old age they planned to be economic migrants again, returning to India, where their dollar would go much further. India was the coda to their American dream. Who wants to live in the United States in old age, they would shudder. It was too expensive, too lonely, too difficult.But according to the Global Age Watch Index, a survey by Help Age International that measures the quality of life \u2014 using income security, health, personal capability and enabling environment \u2014 for people age 60 and older, India ranked 71 out of 96 countries in 2015.There have always been instances of older people being abandoned and neglected, treated as burdens and cheated out of property. It is just that now modernity, immigration and globalization make for more convenient scapegoats.An aging specialist once told me that in the West, development came before longevity, but in India aging has come before development. The problem is not the 100 million seniors. The problem is they do not have enough savings. There is little by way of a social safety net and health infrastructure. Too few have health insurance or pensions.India still largely relies on the family to take care of its elderly. The strain is showing as families splinter. The population of Indians older than 60 has grown at twice the rate of the overall population in recent years.Over 100 million Indians are older than 60, according to the Indian government estimates. Help Age India suggests that by 2050 a quarter of the population will be over 60.

{"Headline": "India\u2019s Top Payments App Adds Chatting, Challenging WhatsApp", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 India\u2019s smartphone users love Paytm for sending money and WhatsApp for sending messages. Now each company is getting into the other\u2019s business.Paytm unveiled an updated version of its service on Friday that integrates chat features, including photo and video sharing, into its market-leading digital wallet.The move is a pre-emptive strike against WhatsApp, the global messaging app used by about two-thirds of India\u2019s 300 million smartphone users. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, has been developing a person-to-person payment service for India that it plans to introduce in the next few months.Deepak Abbot, Paytm\u2019s senior vice president of product, said his company had decided to add the communications feature, called Inbox, because its executives saw millions of people using its service to send money to other individuals without any way of discussing those payments inside the app.\u201cIf I sent money to you, I\u2019d wonder, \u2018Hey, have you received the money?\u2019\u201d Mr. Abbot said in an interview. \u201cEither I\u2019d call you, or find another messaging app.\u201d From that simple problem, a full-fledged chat service was born.With nearly $2 billion in financing from Alibaba, China\u2019s leading e-commerce company, and SoftBank, the Japanese investment giant, Paytm jumped in. It marketed itself to small merchants and consumers as an easy way to make all sorts of payments with a few taps on a smartphone. The company now offers a wide range of products, from gold by the gram to airline and movie tickets, and it said 100 million Indians visited its service at least once a month.WhatsApp, which claims more than 200 million monthly active users in India and 1.3 billion worldwide, has eyed business services and person-to-person payments as a potential way to generate revenue from what has been a free service. Facebook paid $22 billion in cash and stock for WhatsApp in 2014.The messaging service has already begun experimenting with verified business accounts in India, which companies use to communicate with customers. The payments feature will let Indian users send immediate payments to one another via a chat message.Neeraj Arora, head of business at WhatsApp, said in an October interview that his team was studying opportunities created by India\u2019s demonetization and the government\u2019s broader campaign to push more business and services online.\u201cThey are trying to digitize every part of society,\u201d said Mr. Arora, who also sits on the board of Paytm. \u201cWe play right in the middle of it. It\u2019s natural for us to think about improving the experience.\u201dWhatsApp\u2019s overall popularity could give its new payments service a leg up, but Mr. Abbot said it would also raise awareness for all digital payment services, including Paytm.WhatsApp, like another new service from Google, Tez, will probably be limited to transferring funds from one person\u2019s bank account to another\u2019s because of complex Indian banking regulations. Paytm has cast itself as a broader financial player, handling payments made by credit and debit cards, the government\u2019s electronic transfer system, and digital wallets.A Paytm banking affiliate is exploring how to offer loans too small to interest a normal bank, with creditworthiness assessed by examining a borrower\u2019s transactions on the service. And a Paytm digital mall is selling physical products.Messaging is just Paytm\u2019s latest brand extension. Mr. Abbot said other plans for the chat service included a personalized news feed of special offers based on each user\u2019s history in the app.\u201cEventually it might become the main screen for Paytm,\u201d he said. \u201cPaytm is at heart a payments company.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Disappearing American Grad Student", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are two very different pictures of the students roaming the hallways and labs at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering.At the undergraduate level, 80 percent are United States residents. At the graduate level, the number is reversed: About 80 percent hail from India, China, Korea, Turkey and other foreign countries.For graduate students far from home, the swirl of cultures is both reassuring and invigorating. \u201cYou\u2019re comfortable everyone is going through the same struggles and journeys as you are,\u201d said Vibhati Joshi of Mumbai, India, who\u2019s in her final semester for a master\u2019s degree in financial engineering. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201dIn arts and humanities, the figure was about 16 percent; in business, a little more than 18 percent.Many factors contribute to the gap, but a major one is the booming job market in technology. For the most part, Americans don\u2019t see the need for an advanced degree when there are so many professional opportunities waiting for them. For some, the price is just too high when they have so much student debt already.\u201cYou can believe that U.S. bachelor\u2019s students, if they\u2019re good, can go get a job at Microsoft or Google with a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d said Edward D. Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington.Universities and employers are eager to tap the pool of international talent that helps them stay competitive globally, and graduate programs have a financial incentive in attracting them: Demand from abroad is so high, administrators don\u2019t see a need to offer as much tuition assistance.The Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, for example, saw a 30 percent decrease in international applications to its professional master\u2019s program for this semester, according to the dean, Joseph J. Helble. Dr. Helble surveyed more than two dozen engineering deans earlier this year, and three quarters of them said they, too, had seen significant drops in international graduate applications. But enrollment, he said, was not off.Still, trends are not clear.\u201cIf there are one or two more years of comparable 20 to 30 percent decreases in international applications, we\u2019re very concerned about our ability to conduct research and spin off and start companies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned from a competitive perspective.\u201dDan Spaulding, who oversees human resources at Zillow Group, the online real estate company, said that in specialized areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence, his company favors graduate degrees, but for the vast majority of its technical jobs, a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science is adequate. He said he has heard concerns from students and managers about an international chill, but for now the supply of students with computer science skills hasn\u2019t been affected.\u201cA great many of them are coming in with programming skills first and looking to radiate out into other business disciplines, product management, product design,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think going deep academically is not a priority for as many computer science students today.\u201dIn 1994, only about 40 percent of students who were enrolled in computer science Ph.D. programs were from outside the country, according to the Computing Research Association survey.As the economy improved, the percentage of Americans in graduate programs dropped. \u201cGoing to grad school became less of a priority for so many students,\u201d said Stuart Zweben, co-author of the survey and professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University. \u201cYou had to really be interested in research or something special.\u201dThe balance of computer science graduate programs began to tilt toward so-called nonresident aliens in the late 1990s, when well-capitalized dot-coms began scouring for programmers, sometimes encouraging summer interns to drop out of school, Dr. Zweben said.Students from other countries have long seen graduate school as their best path to employment and residency in the United States, and for the industry connections they are not likely to find in their home countries.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to get access from here,\u201d said Ms. Joshi, who is president of the N.Y.U. finance club. She wanted to attend N.Y.U. so she could merge her background in information technology with her interest in the financial industry. She has regular exposure to industry speakers and recruiters.And he would like to see more of them enrolled in the graduate programs. \u201cI feel that\u2019s an imbalance,\u201d he said, \u201cthat absolutely needs to be corrected.\u201dNick Wingfield is a technology correspondent at The Times based in Seattle.Advertisement"}

Two days into the project, he said, he noticed that his frequent stress headaches had disappeared and he no longer needed his afternoon power nap. At the end of the week, he told us, meditation was a \u201cgreat stress reliever\u201d and he got better with practice.Anxiety controlErin A. Paul, 30, a musician from the Bronx, said she often has trouble concentrating. Last Thursday, she was playing the French horn at a concert when, she said, she experienced a panic attack. But her meditation practice had helped her through it, she said. \u201cI was able to keep breathing in a methodical way, and focus my mind on the task at hand rather than allowing myself to go down the path of \u2018what\u2019s going to happen next?

Like many of our participants, she said she is under a lot of pressure at her job. Before the meditation project began, she had ended a two-year relationship and was \u201cdevastated,\u201d she said. But during a meditation session on Tuesday, when thoughts of her ex began to surface, she was able to stop and refocus. \u201cIt was 15 minutes of calmness that I could use more often.\u201d She plans to fit small meditation sessions into her schedule.Help managing painA few days before she started meditating, Lola Guerrero, 25, a choreographer and theater director living in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, had hip surgery. The meditation sessions, she said, helped her \u201cmaintain a calm relationship\u201d with how she felt physically. She spent most of the week in bed, she said. Practicing meditation allowed her to transform her situation \u201cinto something constructive and eye-opening.\u201dThose experiences were only a handful of the stories we heard from participants. We\u2019d like to also thank: Judith Caporale of Tudor City; Mary Li Hsu of Lower Manhattan; Sam Liff of Gravesend, Brooklyn; Carolyn Loeb of Ridgewood, Queens; Jonathan Maldonado of the Bronx; Casey Noel of the Upper West Side; Dara Silverman and Sharene Williams of Kensington, Brooklyn; and Jane Wolff of Brooklyn Heights.Stay tuned for our next hands-on project with readers (and yes, we will be looking for volunteers).Here\u2019s what else is happening:Take a deep breath, exhale, and enjoy: It\u2019s a bright and sunny Friday.There\u2019s rain up ahead this weekend.

{"Headline": "Living, Loving and Dying in Church", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorI am the pastor at La Vernia United Methodist Church, seven miles west of Sutherland Springs, where the shooting occurred. Everyone here knew someone associated with the First Baptist Church. One of the dead was a parent whose child was in the 4-H club with a child in our program. Another victim was a lifelong friend of one of my parishioners; they graduated from La Vernia High 38 years ago. People from my congregation had attended Bible study at First Baptist or worked with its members on a mission project.The idea that such a thing would happen in a sacred space, a place where families are supposed to be safe, has angered many people. Churches are places where the spirit of God is felt, where the presence of God is very real, where manners are expected and vulgarity is shunned. The church is where we, with all our faults and failures, come into the presence of the divine to find grace, to find peace, to rest in the arms of the Lord. The church is a sanctuary in the literal sense of the word, set apart, safe, protecting. All this was shattered.Things like this don\u2019t happen in small towns like ours. Those who moved to the country to protect their family from the perceived dangers of the city were especially shaken.Almost every family here identifies with a church. In some cases, it\u2019s more a matter of a family tradition than active participation. But for weddings and funerals, it is usually the \u201cfamily church\u201d that\u2019s called. Even so, families go to different churches as they find activities that fit their needs. The Boy Scouts at the Methodist church. Soccer at the Roman Catholic church. Lions Club meetings at the Church of Christ.One church has a clinic while another has a day care and still another a weekly lunch for the elderly. The churches work together to run a food bank, sponsor blood drives, and hold community worship services on Thanksgiving and Good Friday.In our community, there is a deep, solid, underlying faith in God, even if it doesn\u2019t manifest itself in church attendance every week. Immediately after the shooting the churches started receiving and making offers of help. They rushed meals to those grieving and to the emergency workers. They were called on to help fund funerals and host a blood drive. Lutheran, Catholic, Methodist, Baptist, nondenominational \u2014 it didn\u2019t matter. Christ commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves, and the churches are where the people come together to serve in ways bigger than each of us can serve individually.On Sunday night, a theology student at Texas Lutheran University in Seguin, about 20 miles north, posted on Facebook about a prayer vigil he was organizing. I went to participate and was asked to join him in leading it. I saw people from my own church. I saw people from one of the nondenominational churches, a Catholic church, and a Methodist church in Floresville. Together we sang songs of worship and praise. Together we prayed for the victims and their families. The people from many churches became the Church, the one Body of Christ \u2014 holy, universal and apostolic \u2014 in love and compassion.A church in Wilson County is a community center where good people strive to do good for fellow human beings. A church in Wilson County is a home for extended family to share their lives. A church in Wilson County is a place where we come to mourn losses, grieve the death of a friend or relative, celebrate the joys of life and love. A church in Wilson County is a place where we connect with the God who loves us, watches over us, and, in the end, welcomes us home.Stephen A.

{"Headline": "Here Comes the Best Part of Thanksgiving: Leftovers", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn that pause before pie, when the bulk of the Thanksgiving meal is over and it\u2019s time to stack gravy-smeared plates and carry them to the sink, every cook is happy.It\u2019s not only that the labor of cooking for a crowd is over and that everyone is well fed. It\u2019s the endless possibilities of that turkey carcass on the counter. A cook looks at a wrecked bird and sees salads and soups, tacos and dumplings, sandwiches and noodle dishes, already halfway there.When it comes to leftover turkey, Ms. Raij carves off the prime cuts first, then picks all the smaller pieces of meat off the bones by hand. She makes a brown stock with the carcass. The little pieces are ideal for chilaquiles, or for baking into enchiladas. The stock might bring depth to arroz brut, a soupy rice dish she packs with vegetables and larger pieces of meat.Leftovers are also an invitation to digress from the usual menu, to tinker and experiment.I don\u2019t have much counter space or the luxury of a second refrigerator, which means there\u2019s no putting this off: I start breaking down the turkey right away, before Thanksgiving dinner is even over. It is, just like roasting and carving the bird, a part of the ritual.While the water is boiling for coffee, I cut the remaining meat and pack it up, wrapping some for guests who\u2019d like to take it home. Then I put the carcass in a stockpot and cover it with water, tossing in a halved onion, a carrot and any herb stems saved from the day\u2019s prep.Through dessert, and the post-dessert drawing and painting sessions with my nieces and nephews that follow at the coffee table, the stock simmers along quietly and unattended. After a couple of hours, I\u2019ll strain the liquid and set the hot carcass aside. When it\u2019s cool enough to touch, sometime before I go to bed, I\u2019ll pull any meat that remains and get it into the fridge, along with the stock. By then, the carcass has nothing left to give, and I can get rid of it.This strategy of breaking down the turkey means you\u2019re more likely to use all of its parts, and makes the refrigerator appear like the organized walk-in of a tiny, turkey-loving restaurant. The rest of the year, it\u2019s all raw vegetables in various states of freshness and jarred condiments, but peer in the morning after Thanksgiving, and you\u2019ll see labeled containers of homemade, gelatin-rich turkey stock, and slices of cooked dark and white meat, all ready to be turned into the special of the day.Nine accomplished writers share their stories of the holiday.These are building blocks, the setup for at least three excellent meals that go well beyond warming up a plate of leftovers in the microwave (its own, distinct pleasure, to be sure).On the first day, when the meat can still be enjoyed as is, it\u2019s easy to pull the roasted pieces into thick shreds and put together a turkey salad.Ms. Admony makes hers by folding the meat with pieces of fried eggplant and potato, hard-boiled eggs and a tart aioli spiked with dried mango powder. I often toss the cold meat with ripped-up leaves of mint and cilantro, green chiles, plenty of lime juice and a mix of raw and fried shallots. Served as is, or over some rice noodles, it\u2019s a quick way to use up the best pieces of meat that are left.The turkey stock, strained and kept in the fridge, is good for any kind of soup on the second day of leftovers. I take inspiration from my friend Whitney Reynolds, who comes from Tennessee. Her family makes turkey and noodles on Thanksgiving Day, serving it alongside the roasted meat and vegetable dishes.At my table, this would be considered radical, but after Thanksgiving there are no rules.The noodle dough \u2014 the recipe comes from Ms. Reynolds\u2019s father, Jeff Reynolds \u2014 can be put together quickly, by hand. Rolled out to about the size of a piece of pie dough and cut into tiny batons, as long and thick as French fries, it\u2019s left out for hours to firm up and dry out, to get ready for a long simmer.The noodles rehydrate in boiling turkey stock, bubbling away for about a half-hour, until they are tender and sticky-edged, infused all the way through with the flavor of roasted turkey. The stock itself reduces in that time and thickens, landing somewhere on the texture dial between soup and gravy.Ms. Reynolds, a noodle purist, insists on serving the dish simply, without meat or herbs or any such adulteration in the sauce, just some generous grinds of black pepper. It is deeply comforting this way, an ode to roasted turkey with no roasted turkey in sight. But if you\u2019ve got an excess of meat in the fridge, you might see this as another opportunity to serve it, shredded and simmered with the noodles.This brings us to Day 3 of leftovers, and to the least celebrated part of the turkey: the scraps of meat pulled after making stock, which are far less substantial than the roasted meat.Crisp them patiently in a cast-iron pan, and they could top rice or tortillas with a squirt of hot sauce. But I had pav bhaji on my mind, because I always have pav bhaji on my mind. The Indian dish is usually made from a spicy mash of vegetables, served with buttered, toasted buns.Ginger, garlic and green chile zap the turkey with warmth and flavor, as do crushed tomatoes and garam masala. To serve it, I press buttered potato rolls into a hot pan, until they are crisp and brown. When it\u2019s time to eat, everyone makes sloppy, delicious tartines, piling the bread with a spoonful of turkey, a little chopped onion and cilantro, and a squeeze of lime.It\u2019s a dish I would never have found my way to, except in the aftermath of Thanksgiving, with a fridge full of semi-organized leftovers and an impulse to not waste any of them. Now, it\u2019s a tradition.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

It takes less than 15 minutes for everyone in the complex to hear about \u201cla migra,\u201d whereupon they shut their doors and hold their breath. Some show up late to work, and others skip it altogether. The school bus might leave some children behind.\u201cIt\u2019s just us helping each other out,\u201d said Ms. Monteros, 35. \u201cThere\u2019s fear every day.\u201dFew places in the United States have simultaneously beckoned undocumented immigrants and penalized them for coming like metropolitan Atlanta, a boomtown of construction and service jobs where conservative politics and new national policies have turned every waking day into a gamble.Freed of constraints, the regional ICE office in Atlanta made nearly 80 percent more arrests in the first half of this year than it did in the same period last year, the largest increase of any field office in the country.It has had help. Local sheriffs and the police have been working with federal agents to identify and detain immigrants, a model of cooperation that the Trump administration is rapidly trying to expand throughout the country.Atlanta\u2019s immigrants can do little but hide. At strip-mall taquerias and fruit stands, business has lagged. Word of the arrests flows through neighborhood phone trees, and Facebook has become an early-warning system for people desperate for clues about where ICE is operating. All around the metropolitan area, cabs and Uber cars are picking up immigrants who know driving their own cars may get them no further than detention.As the Trump administration pushes the rest of the country toward tougher immigration enforcement, the Atlanta area offers a glimpse of what could be.Parked outside their target\u2019s home in Norcross, northeast of Atlanta, in the pre-dawn blackness, the ICE agents watched the neighborhood blink awake, bedroom light by bedroom light.Inside the small house was a 48-year-old school maintenance supervisor named David Martinez-Samano, who had a pair of felony convictions for domestic violence from 1996 and 1997, plus a rape charge that a plea bargain reduced to a lesser charge. He had served time in prison and had been deported to Mexico twice.\u201cSo he\u2019s a pretty bad guy,\u201d one agent told the team, \u201cand we want to get him off the streets.\u201dMr. Martinez-Samano\u2019s window glowed at 6:09 a.m. A little later, his wife emerged to walk one of their daughters to the school bus.Then his Honda Civic shivered to life. As he headed for a turn, the blue lights of the SUVs went blazing down the street.Within two minutes of being pulled over, Mr. Martinez-Samano was handcuffed, patted down and stowed in a back seat. The quick turnaround, ICE officials said, minimized the chances that rubbernecks would post a video on Facebook, where, inevitably, it would be described as a checkpoint or a random traffic stop.At the agency\u2019s Atlanta building, where detainees in orange jumpsuits filled the holding cells ringing the fluorescent intake room, Mr. Martinez-Samano sat stoically in handcuffs.The agents were doing their jobs, he said in a brief interview. But, he said, he did not think he was worth ICE\u2019s time. Having already gone to prison, he said, \u201cI already paid.\u201dJust the day before, he and his wife had been at the hospital with their eldest daughter, celebrating the birth of their first grandson.ICE\u2019s Atlanta office made 7,753 arrests across Georgia and the Carolinas from January through June, the most recent period for which data was available. That was more than any other field office except Dallas\u2019s, and an increase of nearly 80 percent over the same period last year.\u201cIf you\u2019re in this country illegally, you should be scared,\u201d said Sean Gallagher, the Atlanta field office director. \u201cWe\u2019re probably going to come knocking at some point.\u201dICE officials say that agents do not randomly arrest people, instead targeting immigrants such as Mr. Martinez-Samano. But rumor often outpaces fact. In the suburban neighborhoods where hundreds of thousands of immigrants have made precarious camp, dread of a knock from ICE informs every decision.When even going to work seems chancy, trips to the food courts and clothing stands of Plaza Fiesta, a vast Hispanic shopping mall north of Atlanta, have started to seem like a luxury. At El Rosario, which sells rosaries and spiritual sundries, the owner, Ana Robles, said business was down, although one item was selling better than usual: a white Holy Spirit candle, burned to ward off immigration trouble.But information about ICE\u2019s movements, however thin, is worth a thousand candles.\u201cIf Mario says, \u2018Hey, I see guys on Buford Highway,\u2019 I move,\u201d said Mr. Zeron, 44. \u201cMario\u2019s like family. I\u2019ve never met him \u2014 just online. That\u2019s my dream, to meet him. I want to buy him a beer.\u201dMr. Guevara, who has 250,000 Facebook followers and counting, is usually in his car by 4:30 a.m., gulping coffee and chasing tips from suburb to suburb.Asked whether he had any reservations about helping readers evade immigration law, he said he preferred to think he was helping people with no criminal records stay in the country. \u201cHonestly, I believe it\u2019s an honor as a journalist if the people can use your information for protecting their own families,\u201d he said.As he approached a Chamblee Heights apartment one afternoon, three little girls spotted him. \u201cMario!\u201d they shouted. \u201cMario!\u201dThey were the daughters of another devoted reader, Paola, 37. Even as she and her husband discussed moving to a more immigrant-friendly state, she was preparing her children\u2019s passports and laboring to improve their Spanish.\u201cSomeday we\u2019ll be back in Guatemala or Honduras,\u201d she told them, \u201cand no one speaks English there.\u201dThough one daughter played the clarinet in an after-school music program last year, she had to drop out this year because Paola could not pick her up.In Georgia, after all, it is risky even to drive.\u201cIt\u2019s huge for us,\u201d said Mr. Gallagher of ICE, calling the program \u201ca force multiplier.\u201dGabriela Martinez, 28, a single mother of three who illegally crossed the border from Mexico in 2005, was moving the last of her family\u2019s belongings to the new house she had just rented in Norcross when her Ford Expedition was pulled over for a broken brake light in April.She knew the risks. The father of her 5-, 7- and 10-year-old daughters, was deported after being pulled over in 2012. Ever since, she had taught the girls to be extra diligent about wearing seatbelts. Once Mr. Trump took office, she rode with friends and took Ubers as often as possible.But she said she had no choice but to drive to her daughters\u2019 school, to the doctor or to the houses she cleans. As rapidly as the Atlanta area has grown, public transit is practically absent outside Atlanta itself.\u201cEvery time I pull out of here, I think, \u2018Please, God, please, God, don\u2019t let me get stopped,\u2019\u201d she said.She was held for four days at the Gwinnett County jail \u2014 where a sign outside announces \u201cThis is a 287(g) facility\u201d \u2014 before being transferred to an immigration detention center. The friend who had been watching her children when she was arrested told them their mother was traveling for work, but Ms. Martinez called to tell her 10-year-old daughter, Evelyn, the truth.\u201cIf I don\u2019t come home,\u201d she told her, \u201cyou\u2019re in charge.\u201dEvelyn began to wail, sobbing so hard that she dropped the phone. Ms. Martinez could only listen.She was released with an ankle monitor after telling ICE agents about her American-born children. But she still faces possible deportation.An analysis of one month of Gwinnett County jail records from this summer shows that 184 of the 2,726 people booked and charged at the jail were held for immigration authorities. Almost two-thirds of those detained for ICE had been charged with a traffic infraction such as failing to stay in their lane, speeding or driving without a license. Others were booked on charges including assault, child molestation and drug possession.But to Butch Conway, the longtime sheriff of Gwinnett County, there is no reason his deputies should not turn in immigrants caught driving without a license. They are, after all, doubly breaking the law.\u201cI find it offensive that they just thumb their nose at our laws and operate vehicles they are not licensed to operate,\u201d Mr. Conway said in a 2010 interview, \u201con top of the fact that they are here illegally.\u201d (Through a spokeswoman, he declined to comment for this article.)In nearby Cobb County, Maria Hernandez, a school janitor from Mexico, was arrested while driving home from work one night in May. An officer conducting a random license tag check, a common practice in some police departments, had determined through a state database that the tag had been suspended because the car lacked insurance. After pulling over Ms. Hernandez, the officer then discovered she had no driver\u2019s license.Her boss tried to bail her out of the Cobb County jail, but was told that the money would go to waste: She was headed to immigration detention, where she would spend three days trying to explain that she was a single mother with a sick child. Estefania, her 13-year-old daughter, was being treated for depression after a suicide attempt.Ms. Hernandez was released, given an ankle monitor and told to report back with a plane ticket. (A lawyer has helped delay the deportation.)Her car, in fact, was insured; the officer had called in the wrong license tag, according to a Cobb County Police Department spokesman, Sgt. Dana Pierce.Sergeant Pierce said it made no difference, given Ms. Hernandez\u2019s lack of a driver\u2019s license. Generally, \u201cthere is no singling out of any race, creed, color, religion or anything else,\u201d the sergeant said.But by the time the mistake was discovered, it was too late. Ms. Hernandez was already being booked into the county jail.Robert Gebeloff contributed reporting from New York, and Mariano Castillo from Chamblee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Democratic Party", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA year ago this week, America made what I believe history will record as one of the greatest electoral mistakes in the life of the nation: It elected Donald Trump president of the United States.It did so while drowning in Russia-produced propaganda, under a torrent of Russia-stolen emails, facing the stiff arm of renewed voter suppression, and on the watch of a splintering and dysfunctional Democratic Party.All of those caveats are valid and necessary, but they don\u2019t undo what has been done. They rightly call into question the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s presidency, but they don\u2019t nullify it.The only remedy is removal, and that\u2019s a very high bar, although recent moves in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation have renewed hopes.How did we get here?This is becoming old saw: Russia stole and published emails and also generated fake news, all in an attempt to hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of being elected and therefore to aid Trump\u2019s chances. What is new is knowledge of the overwhelming extent of Russia\u2019s meddling and how it was aimed specifically at widening America\u2019s divisions.Russia used American technology and American companies as weapons against American democracy.The Democratic Party, or at least many of its highest-profile figureheads from the last election, is locked in a vicious cycle of re-examinations and recriminations. The latest of those is the controversial new political memoir, \u201cHacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House,\u201d by Donna Brazile, about serving as acting head of the Democratic National Committee during the last legs of the campaign.But at a time when Trump is scrambling for anything at all to distract from Mueller\u2019s plodding \u2014 and fruitful \u2014 investigation, is it the right time to start a three-alarm?I don\u2019t begrudge anyone the right to tell his or her own story, but my focus now is on protecting the country from Trump, and nothing else.The reign of Trump is the reign of ruin. That is why the Resistance is needed now more than ever.More people in polls appear to be waking to the reality that Trump is a walking failure who built his legend and his fortune on the lies that he was savvy and shrewd and a consummate deal maker. They are also waking to the very real possibility that all these Trump campaign contacts with Russians that everyone on the campaign seemed to forget may not be an epidemic of amnesia, but instead a widespread effort to cover something up.Liberals have the will and determination to turn this giant mistake around, to pressure their elected officials or possibly replace them. They have the resolve to resist Trump by every means at their disposal, while clinging to the hope that he might one day be replaced.The only issue I see is that these efforts seem to be operating separately from the national Democratic Party, a dinosaur of bureaucratic machinery in an evolved age of direct democratic action.Liberalism has leapt over the Democratic Party. Liberalism has its eye on a new beginning, while the mainstream party is stuck looking backward and bickering. The Resistance isn\u2019t part of the old Democratic Party; The Resistance is the new Democratic Party, or at least its future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cyclist Lost Her Job After Raising Middle Finger at Trump\u2019s Motorcade", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Virginia cyclist who was photographed extending her middle finger at President Trump\u2019s motorcade as it drove past her last month has lost her job because of the gesture, she said on Monday.Juli Briskman, 50, was riding her bicycle on Lowes Island Boulevard after 3 p.m. on Oct. 28 when she found herself sharing a lane with President Trump\u2019s motorcade, which was leaving the Trump National Golf Course in Sterling, Va. As the fleet of about a half-dozen vehicles started to roll slowly past her, she thought briefly of cutting between the cars and riding away.Instead, Ms. Briskman made the spontaneous gesture. It was captured by news cameras and soon became a moment shared across social media.\u201cHonestly, my blood started boiling at that point,\u201d she said in an interview on Monday, describing when the motorcade overtook her. \u201cI saw somebody holding a newspaper; I assumed he was in there.\u201dMs. Briskman explained that she was angry about steps taken by the Trump administration, including on health insurance and deportations. Earlier in the day she had learned from news reports at the nail salon that Mr. Trump was playing golf in the area.\u201cI just got angry,\u201d Ms. Briskman said. \u201cI lifted my arm and started flipping him off. I started thinking, You\u2019re golfing again when there is so much going on right now.\u201dShe kept her arm up until the rest of the fleet passed and then repeated the gesture a second time when the cars came to a stop and she caught up. She said she locked eyes with a man inside who she thought was a Secret Service agent, and then held the gaze of another man, but then the cars moved past her and drove away.\u201cI did not see him, but he was the target,\u201d she said of Mr. Trump.The moment might have faded into obscurity. But riding along with the president\u2019s motorcade was a gaggle of journalists and photographers who captured the gesture in images that were distributed far and wide, spreading online.It was soon embraced by Trump critics. Ms. Briskman said she became aware of the photograph the next day, when Indivisible Loudoun ACTION, an anti-Trump Facebook group, posted Mr. Herman\u2019s tweet and asked, \u201cWho is this?\u201d Ms. Briskman replied in the comments section that she was the cyclist.\u201cThen the ball started rolling,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it started getting a lot of traction.\u201d She said she kept track of the tens of thousands of times that the photograph was shared from Mr. Herman\u2019s timeline. Jimmy Fallon featured a segment showing the image, she said. And Ms. Briskman was referred to online as a \u201cShe-ro.\u201d\u201cI went in and I said: \u2018Have you heard about the bike woman?\u2019\u201d Ms. Briskman said. The human resources official said no. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to look that up,\u201d Ms. Briskman told her. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dOn Oct. 31, she was called into a meeting with the official and two other company executives.\u201cWe have chosen to separate from you,\u201d she quoted one of them as saying to her, citing the company\u2019s social media policy ban on \u201cobscene content.\u201dShe said she was told that she was not meeting the company\u2019s code of conduct and that the officials feared \u201cit could hurt business\u201d because of their work related to government contracts.Akima expects that a high level of ethical standards and personal integrity will be reflected in all of its business dealings.Similarly, Akima expects its employees, officers and directors to exercise good judgment and maintain high ethical standards in all activities which affect Akima. Every Akima employee is held to these standards.Ms. Briskman said she was later encouraged by the human resources official to submit a resignation because it would be easier to get future work. She did, calling it a \u201cforced resignation.\u201d She was escorted from the building.\u201cI was surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t view that as obscene as other content that you see out there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Cliff-Edge Town Visited by Poets, Dolphins \u2014 and Octopuses", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew Quay JournalNEW QUAY, Wales \u2014 The poet Dylan Thomas called this the \u201ccliff-edge town at the far end of Wales,\u201d but lately it has become better known as the place where the octopuses crawled out of the sea.\u201cYes I did say that,\u201d Mr. Stones said, as we went out on a final dolphin-spotting cruise one recent day. \u201cBut you had to be there. And they seemed quite with it, not like they were dying.\u201d Some were even spotted walking on their eight arms up the stone ramp to the lifeboat station.The octopuses did not hang around long. Conservation-minded locals plopped them back into the sea; fishermen scooped them up and took them home. One posted a Facebook picture showing a bucketful. \u201cHe\u2019s a fisherman so I guess he\u2019s in favor of eating whatever comes out of the sea,\u201d Mr. Stones said.\u201cOh well,\u201d he said, with a good-natured laugh. \u201cThat and other things going on in my sad life.\u201dBefore he brought his boat up on the beach under the curve of the old quay (it was new in 1834), Mr. Stones did one last cruise of the bay, and within minutes came across a small pod of bottlenose dolphins, not more than two football fields out. \u201cThis is the best place in the U.K. to see dolphins,\u201d Mr. Stones said.\u201cYou never get tired of seeing them,\u201d Mr. Stones said.There were three adults and two calves, one a newborn. He said the newborn seemed to still be learning how to swim properly, and it breached awkwardly.Local watchers later said its mother may have been a famous cow who was first spotted as an adult 30 years ago, so is nearly 40 now but remarkably still procreating. Dolphins typically live only into their 20s in the wild, though some have been known to reach their 60s.That cow actually has two names. One set of dolphin watchers here, the Marine Wildlife Center, call her Sue, and the other set, Seawatch, call her Ghost.Yes, tiny New Quay, population 1,000 people and 200 to 300 dolphins, has two dolphin-tracking organizations, each of which keep separate lists of the animals.New Quay is a photogenic place, even after most of the boats are pulled up for winter. From the Cnwcy Glap, or Chat Corner, a stone-built hangout on the cliff-top main street, it is easy to see what Dylan Thomas meant about the curved quay \u201cshouldering out to sea.\u201dOn the hill behind is what the poet referred to as a \u201chill of windows,\u201d rows of stucco-fronted houses painted in bright colors. The poet never mentioned that bright palette; apparently, it\u2019s a modern phenomenon.In Thomas\u2019s time here, only 1944-45, it was a fishing village, a place for sea captains to retire \u201csober as Sunday.\u201d Now the pubs greatly outnumber the churches, probably because of the new tourist trade, though there were plenty in the poet\u2019s day. A famous alcoholic, he was a regular at a couple.Winston Evans, 78, remembers when the fishing was so good that he had to go out only five days a week to make a living. Then prices rose in the 70s, \u201cand we all bought bigger boats, so we had to go out seven days a week to pay for them.\u201d Then prices fell, and restrictions on catches came in, and times were hard again.Then, as he recalled, in the 90s, a local conservationist, Alan Bryant, \u201cdiscovered\u201d the dolphins. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know they were dolphins, we used to call them tumblers,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cHe showed us these were bottleneck dolphins and that started the ball rolling.\u201dMr. Evans soon bought three dolphin-sighting boats. \u201cDolphins, it\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s happened to New Quay,\u201d Mr. Evans said.There are three dolphin-spotting tour companies in town these days. \u201cThey should rename it Dolphinville,\u201d Mr. Stones said.The dolphins brought the tourists. Then came the paint jobs, to prettify the old cottages. Next were the weekend homeowners up from London. They own a big chunk of the housing now \u2014 some rowhouses are said to go for a million pounds \u2014 sending some local young house hunters off to the trailer parks that surround the town.More worrying is the gradual though slow decline in dolphin numbers in the area. Peter Evans (no relation to Winston Evans), a marine biologist and director at Seawatch, the dolphin-watching group, said one theory being studied was whether all the dolphin watching was gradually chasing the dolphins away.Mr. Stones acknowledged the possibility that one day Dolphinville might have no dolphins, but said that would not be the end of the world. \u201cWe\u2019ll still have 22 species of sea birds,\u201d he said.Mr. Evans, the fisherman, is hedging his bets. He had sold his fishing boat when he started his dolphin-watching business, but the buyer had bad luck and one night went down to the pub and impulsively put the boat up for sale. Mr. Evans snapped it back up, and is out fishing again.\u201cIt\u2019s a strange old world, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.Or as Dylan Thomas put it, in \u201cUnder Milk Wood,\u201d which is putatively based on New Quay characters: \u201cOh, isn\u2019t life a terrible thing, thank God?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Playlist: Eminem Reflects, Sturgill Simpson Busks and 11 More New Songs", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week\u2019s most notable new songs and videos \u2014 and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. This week, Elvis Costello croons on a new soundtrack song, Superchunk issues a blast of disillusionment and Betty Davis delivers a dose of \u201cF.U.N.K.\u201dOn the new Eminem single, there is no sense of mischief or joy, no sense of danger or devastation. Instead Eminem, once a master of playful extremes, is in excavation mode, assessing his diminished place in pop culture, and wondering if all the effort it requires to be him \u2014 and to spin the gold he has spun \u2014 is worth undertaking once more. \u201cWalk on Water\u201d \u2014 the first single from his forthcoming album, \u201cRevival\u201d \u2014 is grim and ponderous and, to its credit, seems to understand that it might be perceived as grim and ponderous. \u201cButterflies rip apart my stomach,\u201d he raps, \u201cknowing that no matter what bars I come with/you\u2019re gonna harp, gripe/and that\u2019s a hard Vicodin to swallow.\u201dEminem has been self-lacerating before, but perhaps never this soberly. And there are feelings here that are alarmingly, and arrestingly, stark: \u201cAlways in search of the verse that I haven\u2019t spit yet/Will this step just be another misstep/To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect I\u2019ve garnered?\u201d Rapping about rapping is among his strongest skills, but for every deft turn of phrase here, there are deeply awkward moments, too (\u201cIt\u2019s true, I\u2019m a Rubik\u2019s/A beautiful mess\u201d).A song like this, misguided though it may be \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9 sings the chorus, reduced to an unimaginative avatar of dignity and goodness, and Rick Rubin produces what\u2019s little more than a glum piano \u2014 can only come from a place of savvy. Eminem is alive to the way he is seen, and astute enough to know he has few moves available to him, especially in a cultural moment likely to abjure his scathing, violent early work. \u201cNow I\u2019m getting clowned and frowned on,\u201d he laments.Still, considering that for almost two decades Eminem has been, for white rappers, both the high-water mark and also the most visible and theatrical personality, it is astonishing to hear him rapping \u2014 in mood, tone and, sometimes, pattern \u2014 like Macklemore. JON CARAMANICAElvis Costello is in crooner mode for \u201cYou Shouldn\u2019t Look at Me That Way\u201d from the soundtrack of \u201cFilm Stars Don\u2019t Die in Liverpool,\u201d about the later years of a faded movie actress. It\u2019s a piano waltz backed by an orchestra, a throwback style neatly suited to thoughts about the ravages of time and mortality: \u201cFrom the first flush of affection/to avoiding your own reflection.\u201d JON PARELESShould you be nostalgic for the self-confident rock \u2019n\u2019 roll urgency of the mid-2000s, take comfort in the fact that no amount of social, cultural or political change has convinced Evanescence to veer from its lite-opera-rock theater. \u201cMy Heart Is Broken\u201d is one of the better songs on \u201cSynthesis,\u201d the group\u2019s fourth album and first since 2011, which sounds like an only mildly restrained version of its earliest work. Amy Lee\u2019s voice remains vibrant, soaring and sweet. She makes disappointment sound like romance. J.C.\u201cTo see the rot in no disguise/Oh what a time to be alive,\u201d Mac McCaughan of Superchunk sings in the title song from an album due in February. The distorted blare and galloping beat are true to the band\u2019s indie-rock beginnings, back in 1989; the furious disillusionment is from right now. J.P.On his remarkable new album, \u201cI Am a Man,\u201d the trumpeter Ron Miles nestles his light and buoyant sound inside compositions that bespeak an aching memory and a righteous ambition. He has convened an all-star quintet, with Jason Moran on piano, Bill Frisell on guitar, Thomas Morgan on bass and Brian Blade on drums. They play seven Miles originals meditating on the revolutionary potential of spirituality, and the need to reject political oppression. On the album\u2019s epic finale, \u201cIs There Room in Your Heart for a Man Like Me,\u201d tension builds around two repeated notes, just a half-step apart, before opening onto a slowly ascending landscape of twirling, laconic melodies and subtly dazzling interplay. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLOSimbiatu Ajikawo, the British songwriter who calls herself Little Simz, raps, sings and plays guitar in \u201cPoison Ivy,\u201d a tale of a \u201ctoxic\u201d romance that she can\u2019t pull away from. Its minor-key groove transforms itself into R&B, psychedelia and North African desert blues, circling through four chords that offer no way out. J.P.On \u201c\u00f7,\u201d the most recent album from Ed Sheeran, he teamed up with the Ghanaian-British rapper-singer Fuse ODG for a light, charming duet, \u201cBibia Be Ye Ye.\u201d Now, he has returned the favor, singing in Twi on Fuse ODG\u2019s new single, \u201cBoa Me,\u201d a song that effectively blends the two artists\u2019 brands of exultant optimism. J.C.\u201cF.U.N.K.\u201d is part of \u201cNasty Gal,\u201d the 1975 album by Betty Davis, who was briefly married to Miles Davis in the late 1960s; the full album is to be reissued early next year. Raw and often raunchy funk was her calling; Ms. Davis rasps, teases, moans and screams through songs like \u201cF.U.N.K.\u201d Its lyrics list a funk pantheon, while its groove, elaborated through the crosstalk of guitar and clavinet, and Ms. Davis\u2019s vehement, hopped-up vocals, tell a wilder story. J.P. \u201cHalf Life\u201d is a freeze frame at the moment of a breakup: \u201cWe pull apart so patiently,\u201d sing the two women in the Australian folk-pop duo Oh Pep! They\u2019re backed by a plush orchestra and a brisk drumbeat, sharing a melody that\u2019s both angular and affectionate, already looking toward the aftermath: \u201cYou will become an echo of a sound once heard/scattered through my universe.\u201d J.P.Errorsmith, which just released the album \u201cSuperlative Fatigue,\u201d is the very occasional project of the electronic musician and software designer Erik Weigand; its previous album came out in 2004. The music uses a bare handful of sounds in ways that are transparent, propulsive and, in tracks like \u201cInternet of Screws,\u201d downright comedic. With its minimal vocabulary of syncopated drum taps, nearly nonstop mechanical blipping and silly, sliding tones, the track is like five minutes of sped-up slapstick. J.P.\u201cUnfiltered Universe\u201d is the third album in a trilogy from Rez Abbasi, a guitarist of Pakistani descent, who has used each record to look at a different South Asian musical tradition. This one is focused on the Carnatic lineage of South India, and like the others it features Mr. Abbasi\u2019s powerful band, Invocation: the saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, the pianist Vijay Iyer, the cellist Elizabeth Mikhael, the bassist Johannes Weidenmueller and the drummer Dan Weiss. On \u201cPropensity,\u201d each instrument seems to be advocating for a distinct interpretation of the song\u2019s rhythm; sparks flash between them. Mr. Abbasi flies into the fray after a darting solo from Mr. Mahanthappa, using his creamy distortion and patient phrasing as a ballast in the swarm. G.R.Advertisement"}

Is Accused by 5 Women of Sexual Misconduct", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs soon as they sat down in his room, still wrapped in their winter jackets and hats, Louis C.K. asked if he could take out his penis, the women said.They thought it was a joke and laughed it off. \u201cAnd then he really did it,\u201d Ms. Goodman said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cHe proceeded to take all of his clothes off, and get completely naked, and started masturbating.\u201dIn 2003, Abby Schachner called Louis C.K. to invite him to one of her shows, and during the phone conversation, she said, she could hear him masturbating as they spoke. Another comedian, Rebecca Corry, said that while she was appearing with Louis C.K. on a television pilot in 2005, he asked if he could masturbate in front of her. She declined.Now, after years of unsubstantiated rumors about Louis C.K. masturbating in front of associates, women are coming forward to describe what they experienced. Even amid the current burst of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men, the stories about Louis C.K. stand out because he has so few equals in comedy. In the years since the incidents the women describe, he has sold out Madison Square Garden eight times, created an Emmy-winning TV series, and accumulated the clout of a tastemaker and auteur, with the help of a manager who represents some of the biggest names in comedy. And Louis C.K. built a reputation as the unlikely conscience of the comedy scene, by making audiences laugh about hypocrisy \u2014 especially male hypocrisy.After being contacted for an interview this week about the on-the-record accusations of sexual misconduct \u2014 encounters that took place over a decade ago \u2014 Louis C.K.\u2019s publicist, Lewis Kay, said the comedian would not respond. \u201cLouis is not going to answer any questions,\u201d Mr. Kay wrote in an email Tuesday night.For comedians, the professional environment is informal: profanity and raunch that would be far out of line in most workplaces are common, and personal foibles \u2014 the weirder the better \u2014 are routinely mined for material. But Louis C.K.\u2019s behavior was abusive, the women said.\u201cI think the line gets crossed when you take all your clothes off and start masturbating,\u201d Ms. Wolov said.Ms. Corry, a comedian, writer and actress, has long felt haunted by her run-in with Louis C.K. In 2005, she was working as a performer and producer on a television pilot \u2014 a big step in her career \u2014 when Louis C.K., a guest star, approached her as she was walking to the set. \u201cHe leaned close to my face and said, \u2018Can I ask you something?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d Ms. Corry said in a written statement to The New York Times. \u201cHe asked if we could go to my dressing room so he could masturbate in front of me.\u201d Stunned and angry, Ms. Corry said she declined, and pointed out that he had a daughter and a pregnant wife. \u201cHis face got red,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand he told me he had issues.\u201dWord quickly reached the show\u2019s executive producers, Courteney Cox and David Arquette, who both confirmed the incident. \u201cWhat happened to Rebecca on that set was awful,\u201d Ms. Cox said in an email, adding that she felt \u201coutrage and shock.\u201d\u201cMy concern was to create an environment where Rebecca felt safe, protected and heard,\u201d she said. They discussed curtailing the production. Ms. Corry decided to continue with the show.\u201cThings were going well for me,\u201d Ms. Corry said in the statement, \u201cand I had no interest in being the person who shut down a production.\u201dA fifth woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect her family\u2019s privacy because she has not been publicly linked to the incident with Louis C.K., also has disturbing memories about an incident with the comedian. In the late \u201990s, she was working in production at \u201cThe Chris Rock Show\u201d when Louis C.K., a writer and producer there, repeatedly asked her to watch him masturbate, she said. She was in her early 20s and went along with his request, but later questioned his behavior.\u201cIt was something that I knew was wrong,\u201d said the woman, who described sitting in Louis C.K.\u2019s office while he masturbated in his desk chair during a workday, other colleagues just outside the door. \u201cI think the big piece of why I said yes was because of the culture,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe abused his power.\u201d A co-worker at \u201cThe Chris Rock Show,\u201d who also wished to remain anonymous, confirmed that the woman told him about the experience soon after it happened.Ms. Schachner, a writer, illustrator and performer, admired Louis C.K.\u2019s work. They had met in the comedy scene; Ms. Schachner\u2019s former boyfriend was a comedy writer who had worked with Louis C.K. In 2003, when she called Louis C.K. with an invitation to her show, he said he was at work in an office as a writer on the series \u201cCedric the Entertainer Presents,\u201d she recalled.Their conversation quickly moved from the personal \u2014 Louis C.K. had seen photos of her on her boyfriend\u2019s desk, he said, and told her he thought she was cute \u2014 to \u201cunprofessional and inappropriate,\u201d Ms. Schachner said.She said she heard the blinds coming down. Then he slowly started telling her his sexual fantasies, breathing heavily and talking softly. She realized he was masturbating, and was dumbfounded. The call went on for several minutes, even though, Ms. Schachner said, \u201cI definitely wasn\u2019t encouraging it.\u201d But she didn\u2019t know how to end it, either. \u201cYou want to believe it\u2019s not happening,\u201d she said. A friend, Stuart Harris, confirmed that Ms. Schachner had described the call to him in 2003.For years afterward, Ms. Schachner said, she felt angry and betrayed by an artist she looked up to. And she wondered what she could have done differently. \u201cI felt very ashamed,\u201d she said.During Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov\u2019s surreal visit to Louis C.K.\u2019s Aspen hotel room, they said they were holding onto each other, screaming and laughing in shock, as Louis C.K. masturbated in a chair. \u201cWe were paralyzed,\u201d Ms. Goodman said. After he ejaculated on his stomach, they said, they fled. He called after them: \u201cHe was like, \u2018Which one is Dana and which one is Julia?\u2019\u201d Ms. Goodman recalled.Hoping that outrage would build against Louis C.K., and also to shame him, they began telling others about the incident the next day. But many people seemed to recoil, they said. \u201cGuys were backing away from us,\u201d Ms. Wolov said. Barely 24 hours after they left Louis C.K.\u2019s hotel, \u201cwe could already feel the backlash.\u201dSoon after, they said they understood from their managers that Mr. Becky, Louis C.K\u2019s manager, wanted them to stop telling people about their encounter with Louis C.K. Lee Kernis, one of the women\u2019s managers at the time, confirmed on Thursday that he had a conversation in which he told Mr. Becky that Louis C.K.\u2019s behavior toward the women had been offensive. Mr. Kernis also said that Mr. Becky was upset that the women were talking openly about the incident.Mr. Becky denied making any threats toward the women. \u201cI don\u2019t recall the exact specifics of the conversation, but know I never threatened anyone,\u201d he wrote by email on Thursday. Ms. Halpern and Robert Schroeder \u2014 Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov\u2019s agent at the time \u2014 said that the pair told them that they felt they had been warned to stop talking.Mr. Becky arguably wields even more power in comedy than Louis C.K. He represents Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Amy Poehler and other top performers, and his company, 3 Arts, puts together programming deals for nearly every platform.Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov moved to Los Angeles shortly after the Aspen festival, but \u201cwe were coming here with a bunch of enemies,\u201d Ms. Goodman said. Gren Wells, a filmmaker who befriended the comedy duo in 2002, said the incident and the warning, which they told her about soon after Aspen, hung heavily over them both. \u201cThis is something that they were freaked out about,\u201d Ms. Wells said.In the years since, Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov have found some success, but they remained concerned about Mr. Becky and took themselves out of the running for the many projects he was involved in. Though their humor is in line with what he produces, \u201cwe know immediately that we can never even submit our material,\u201d Ms. Wolov said.\u201cSadly, I\u2019ve come to learn that Louis C.K.\u2019s victims are not only real,\u201d she said by email, \u201cbut many are actual friends of mine within the comedy community,\u201d like Ms. Corry, who confided in her, she said.Yet in an interview with The Times in September at the Toronto film festival, where \u201cI Love You, Daddy,\u201d was shown, Louis C.K. dismissed stories of his alleged sexual misconduct as \u201crumors,\u201d and said the notion that the masturbation scenes referred to them never occurred to him. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, I didn\u2019t think of that, \u201d he said.In private, though, he appears to have acknowledged his behavior.In 2009, six years after their phone call, Ms. Schachner received a Facebook message from Louis C.K., apologizing. \u201cLast time I talked to you ended in a sordid fashion,\u201d he wrote in the message, which was reviewed by The Times. \u201cThat was a bad time in my life and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He added that he had seen some of Ms. Schachner\u2019s comedy and thought she was funny. \u201cI remember thinking what a repulsive person I was being by responding the way that I did,\u201d he wrote.Ms. Schachner accepted his apology and told him she forgave him. But the original interaction left her deeply dispirited, she said, and was one of the things that discouraged her from pursuing comedy.The call confounded her, Ms. Corry said: not only had he misremembered the incident, which made her think there were other moments of misconduct, he also implied she had done something to invite his behavior. \u201cIt is unfair he\u2019s put me or anyone else in this position,\u201d Ms. Corry said.Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that with other allegations swirling around the entertainment world, they could no longer stay silent. \u201cBecause of this moment, as gross as it is, we feel compelled to speak,\u201d Ms. Goodman said.Ms. Notaro said she was standing in support of those with the courage \u201cto speak up against such a powerful figure,\u201d she said, \u201cas well as the multitude of women still out there, not quite ready to share their nightmares.\u201dWilliam K.

{"Headline": "Spurned by ESPN, Barstool Sports Is Staying on Offense", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "FeatureThe insurgent media company has built a devoted following of what it sees as \u201caverage\u201d sports fans: unruly, occasionally toxic and aggressively male.Supported byOn an overcast day in June, Dave Portnoy, Barstool\u2019s wiry, 40-year-old founder \u2014 known to followers as El Presidente \u2014 stood shirtless in front of a green screen rapping, trying to recreate an Instagram video LeBron James had posted from the gym. At the other end of the office, a gaggle of dudes in impressively obscure jerseys hyped up a one-on-one basketball game between two bloggers called Smitty and Gay Pat. I sat down next to Noah Ives, a pale, slightly hunched intern, who was 21 and recently graduated from a communications program at Syracuse University. In decades past, Ives might have spent his summers at ESPN headquarters in Bristol, Conn., coiling wires and fetching coffee. \u201cESPN was definitely on my mind when I got to college,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut Barstool is just a cooler brand that people my age just respect more.\u201d When I asked him what he meant by \u201crespect,\u201d Ives smirked and said: \u201cThe takes are just much more relatable. It\u2019s like Pres says \u2014 Barstool is by the common man, for the common man.\u201d He paused before adding: \u201cESPN is just spitting facts and political correctness.\u201dIves spoke the language of the culture war raging in sports media \u2014 a mix of marketing jargon and Bannon-lite populism directed, at all times, at the self-proclaimed Worldwide Leader in Sports, which stands accused of losing touch with the young bros whose attention it once owned. This is surely part of why, early this fall, ESPN announced \u201cBarstool Van Talk,\u201d a half-hour talk show that would air at 1 a.m. on a secondary channel and feature two of Barstool Sports\u2019s most palatable personalities: Consciously or not, the network wanted to co-opt the resistance.But the day before the Oct. 17 premiere of \u201cVan Talk,\u201d Sam Ponder, host of ESPN\u2019s \u201cSunday N.F.L. Countdown,\u201d tweeted \u201cWelcome to the ESPN family\u201d to one of the show\u2019s hosts \u2014 along with two screen captures of a Barstool blog post from 2014, in which Portnoy called her a \u201cBible-thumping freak\u201d and wrote that her job\u2019s \u201c#1 requirement\u201d was to \u201cmake men hard.\u201d Other outlets, like USA Today\u2019s For the Win blog, surfaced audio from a Barstool show in which Portnoy calls on Ponder to be more \u201cslutty.\u201d Just six days after the first episode aired, John Skipper, ESPN\u2019s president, announced the cancellation of the show in a P.R. statement. \u201cI erred,\u201d he wrote, \u201cin assuming we could distance our efforts from the Barstool site and its content.\u201dThe cancellation sparked joy in sports media\u2019s more progressive ranks, which tend to view Barstool with the same disdain that their colleagues in political news might view Breitbart or The Daily Caller. Skipper\u2019s statement was, however, paying Portnoy a kind of compliment. Only two years ago, any business that wanted to partner with Barstool knew it would be partnering with the unfiltered chauvinism that made Portnoy a minor celebrity in Boston, his hometown. Now the president of the biggest sports network in the world was admitting that he had believed there was a way to temper Barstool for a mainstream market. \u201cOnce upon a time, they\u201d \u2014 ESPN \u2014 \u201cwere the coolest people in the room,\u201d said Richard Deitsch, a media columnist for Sports Illustrated, in a podcast discussing the controversy. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case in 2017. It\u2019s the opposite. They are polarizing; people dislike them on all sides.\u201d By partnering with Barstool, he said, they were trying \u201cto associate themselves with who they believe are the cool kids in the room.\u201dPortnoy says he doesn\u2019t really think ESPN\u2019s future depends on the implied politics of its on-air personalities, but he knows a branding opportunity when he sees one. And the entrenched narrative \u2014 that the once-irreverent network has fed its soul to the hounds of political correctness and liberal fake news \u2014 is certainly an opportunity. As professional athletes have knelt for the national anthem, criticized the president and railed against police violence, ESPN has been repeatedly accused of being too sympathetic to them and too liberal for its own good. A company once built on an aggressively apolitical foundation has somehow become a locus of almost every imaginable type of political fight. As it has blundered its way through widely publicized incidents like Jemele Hill\u2019s tweets about the president and the N.F.L., the sports-radio host Clay Travis has taken to calling the network \u201cMSESPN\u201d; the reporter Britt McHenry has suggested that she was fired from the network for professing her conservative beliefs. Whether these critiques are accurate seems largely irrelevant. Neither does it particularly matter that Portnoy and his cast of bloggers are largely liberal-leaning dudes from the breeding grounds of the coastal elite. There exists a swarm of angry sports fans who maintain that they do not want to talk about Colin Kaepernick or the national anthem, and Barstool has cleared a space for them to gather and talk, mostly, about just how much they don\u2019t want to talk about politics. They claim to be an overlooked majority \u2014 the vast market inefficiency that will richly reward anyone who will let them watch their games, memes and funny videos without having to feel bad about themselves. Barstool is their safe space.Early in the decade, the only sports blogs with any significant audience were Sports by Brooks \u2014 which mostly aggregated news \u2014 and the writer Bill Simmons\u2019s column on AOL\u2019s Digital City Boston. (I later worked for Simmons for three years at Grantland, the ESPN website where he was editor in chief.) Portnoy revered Simmons and agreed with his assessment that Boston\u2019s sports coverage, which was still centered in the column inches of The Globe and The Herald, had grown stale and out of touch with the common man. Not so for Portnoy: In an early mock-up, calling himself Devilfish Dave, he wrote that \u201cthe people at Barstool Sports are a bunch of average Joes, who like most guys love sports, gambling, golfing and chasing short skirts.\u201dBarstool went through the usual spate of early hardships, and there\u2019s every chance that had it been born out of some actual journalistic ideal, it would have folded within the year. But Portnoy\u2019s talent was for gathering feedback from readers and advertisers and tweaking his product accordingly: \u201cWe could pivot really easily,\u201d he told me, \u201cand chase money.\u201d The first breakthrough came when a local photographer told Portnoy he should start putting photos of area women on the tabloid\u2019s covers \u2014 and offered to take the pictures himself. (A version of this idea still exists on the website, under the title \u201cLocal Smokeshow of the Day.\u201d) Around the same time, Portnoy noticed that readers seemed to respond more to stories about drinking, women and gambling than day-to-day sports news. He sold ads to bars and breweries and catered more and more to a certain archetypal Boston bro \u2014 the type who puts on a collared shirt to get blackout drunk every weekend while ruefully cheering on the Red Sox. His writing voice fell into a distinct rhythm, half-cocked and prone to fits of anger. When he finally mustered up a web version of Barstool, it looked like a relic from the 1990s and often crashed, but he called such inconveniences \u201cthe Barstool difference\u201d \u2014 a sign, he maintained, of true authenticity.By the time Barstool began publishing, Simmons had started a national column for ESPN and moved to Los Angeles to write for television. Portnoy had Boston to himself. \u201cWhen Bill was writing on Digital Cities, he was reaching regular guys like me,\u201d Portnoy told me. \u201cI\u2019m reaching the new me.\u201dWhether he knew it or not, Portnoy was also building a modern online-media business well before its time \u2014 with low overhead, an investment in brand loyalty and diversified revenue streams that could withstand fluctuations in advertising. He started hawking T-shirts and merchandise on the site, another venture that fell prey to the Barstool difference; printing and shipping could take months. He built up a network of bloggers in other cities, like Dan Katz in Chicago and Kevin Clancy in New York \u2014 Big Cat and KFC, per their Barstool nicknames. When Portnoy realized that readers were more invested in these bloggers as personalities than in their opinions on sports, he began turning the site into a sort of online reality show: Every office argument and personal-life development was written up and fed to a growing legion of \u201cStoolies.\u201dPart of what Barstool offered these readers was escapism, something that retains a lot of power among sports fans who still see games as a nightly release from their responsibilities. The site\u2019s enduring slogan, \u201cSaturdays Are for the Boys,\u201d promises a day free from girlfriends and wives. Search for the phrase on social media, and you\u2019ll find videos of Stoolies relaxing at beach houses, on boats or at tailgates, surrounded by nothing but shirtless men; in some, they actually push women out of the camera\u2019s frame. Sports could also be a reprieve from office work. In his initial mock-up, in 2003, Portnoy wrote that \u201cwe don\u2019t take ourselves very seriously and view working at Barstool Sports as a way to avoid becoming slaves to cubicle life.\u201d When Clancy, who calls himself \u201cthe king of average,\u201d started writing Barstool New York, he was working as an accountant at Deloitte; when he saw that his tales of mind-numbing corporate boredom were getting traction with readers, he began writing a column called \u201cCubicle Chronicles,\u201d grumbling rancorously about everything from bad coffee to the \u201cfat secretary blasting Dominic the [expletive] Donkey\u201d around Christmas.The only thing the Stoolies wouldn\u2019t do, it turned out, was \u201cpolitics.\u201d For the most part, Portnoy and his readers employed the time-honored bro tactic of saying they had no problem with anyone \u2014 until, of course, \u201canyone\u201d started complaining. A particularly illustrative example of this can be found in an article from 2009, in which a reader informed Portnoy about the \u201cFagbug,\u201d an art installation aimed at raising awareness about homophobic violence. \u201cI could give a [expletive] less if somebody is gay or not,\u201d Portnoy responded, insisting that, much as he enjoyed the female anatomy, if another man preferred the male one, then \u201cmore power to him.\u201d But what, he asked, was the point of the installation? \u201cI thought gay dudes hated being called fags? Or is this like when a black person uses the N-word as a compliment?\u201d He closed by saying all this \u201cfag talk\u201d reminded him of last night\u2019s television: Did anyone else see Adam Lambert on \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d? Every line was aimed directly at dudes who, like Portnoy, would not identify as bigots, but who also scratched their heads at the weird tendencies of anyone who wasn\u2019t exactly like them, self-proclaimed common men.By 2010, Barstool was doing well enough that Portnoy had an office in Milton, Mass., local pages for New York, Chicago and Philadelphia and a handful of employees, including the future YouTube megastar Jenna Mourey, a.k.a. Jenna Marbles. That year, he hired a local white rapper named Sammy Adams and set up a tour of New England colleges. \u201cWhen we showed up on the campuses, they had our signs on their dorms, people were rushing after our bus,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat was the first time I really thought this might be bigger than I anticipated.\u201dThe following year, he started a nationwide party tour called \u201cBarstool Blackout.\u201d The college students who attended danced under blacklights and occasionally \u2014 the obvious implication \u2014 drank until they blacked out. (One of the slogans: \u201cBy the C- student, for the C- student.\u201d) It was Barstool\u2019s first real encounter with controversy. Early in 2012, students in the Boston area demonstrated against the Blackout Parties, claiming that they promoted rape culture and circulating Portnoy\u2019s writings on the subject. \u201cJust to make friends with the feminists,\u201d he\u2019d written on the site, \u201cI\u2019d like to reiterate that we don\u2019t condone rape of any kind at our Blackout Parties in mid-January. However, if a chick passes out, that\u2019s a gray area though.\u201d And: \u201cThough I never condone rape, if you\u2019re a Size 6 and you\u2019re wearing skinny jeans, you kind of deserve to be raped, right?\u201d The parties, which were held at private spaces near campuses, went ahead as planned. Portnoy issued no retractions or apologies. \u201cI think the controversy probably helped us,\u201d he says now. \u201cOur fans liked that we didn\u2019t back down. They realized that I was on their side.\u201dIn a blog post about the sale \u2014 which concluded with the coy signoff \u201cPS \u2014 I\u2019m kinda rich now\u201d \u2014 Portnoy added something prescient: \u201cChernin knows about the Size 6 skinny-jean joke. They know about Babygate.\u201d (The \u201cBabygate\u201d controversy stemmed from Portnoy\u2019s speculating about the size of Tom Brady\u2019s baby\u2019s penis.) \u201cThey know about Al Jazeera.\u201d (In this one, Clancy questioned the legitimacy of any news outlet with an Arabic-sounding name.) \u201cThey get it.\u201dThe Barstool acquisition was engineered by the president of Chernin Digital, Mike Kerns. \u201cWhen I got access to Barstool\u2019s Google analytics, I knew this was something different,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey had something like 20 percent of their visitors coming back about 20 times a day. I\u2019ve been in this business for two decades, and all their numbers bucked the usual trends.\u201d Portnoy kept full editorial control; Chernin\u2019s bet was that it could serve cheap content to his loyal fan base, which would then pay for things like T-shirts, events and premium content. The brand would be scaled up into something that could be sold to advertisers, big media partners and even sports leagues. Every Barstool executive I spoke to mentioned the possibility of opening branded sports bars across the country; all of them talked about partnerships with networks. Since its acquisition, Barstool has released a raft of popular podcasts \u2014 including \u201cPardon My Take,\u201d which, with downloads running up to one million per episode, is one of the biggest sports podcasts in the country. It has partnered with Facebook on a roving pregame college-football show (since canceled) and produced a widely watched baseball show that regularly features former major-league players.This bullish transition has been helmed by Erika Nardini, a 42-year-old former marketing executive who once served as the chief marketing officer for AOL. Nardini, who grew up playing sports with her younger brother, seems uniquely qualified to deal with both the business of turning Barstool into a national brand and the inevitable public- and human-relations disasters that will arise along the way. She is also a woman, and despite its growth since the Chernin acquisition, Barstool still has to work around how bad its worst moments can get \u2014 from Portnoy\u2019s rape jokes to posts like the one a blogger named Chris Spagnuolo wrote this summer: \u201cIs Rihanna Going to Make Being Fat the Hot New Trend?\u201dThe Rihanna incident highlighted how much has changed since the Chernin acquisition, but also how much has stayed more or less the same. The post was quietly taken down. But Portnoy also opined on the site that he thought the post wasn\u2019t \u201cas bad as many are making it out to be,\u201d and that he was angry mostly because Spagnuolo had given \u201cfeminists\u201d fodder to say \u201cthere goes Barstool being Barstool again.\u201d And yet Portnoy himself cannot seem to stop personally offering up more and more of that fodder. A controversy last month, involving the terms of a contract offered to a sports personality named Elika Sadeghi, began on relatively professional footing. Within days, though, Barstool had released a seven-minute animated video in which a cartoon Portnoy says Sadeghi\u2019s surname sounds like \u201cthe monkey from \u2018The Lion King.\u2019\u2009\u201d It also portrays her hanging upside down over a boiling caldron.I spoke to several women in sports media who have had run-ins with Barstool. All described the same pattern: They would tweet something critical of Barstool\u2019s statements about women, which would prompt a response from Portnoy or one of his bloggers. Then came the swarm of Stoolies on social media, who would harass them with misogynist slurs and threats, often for days. Even random sports fans have been targeted. A few years ago, a Cubs fan named Missy suffered a brain injury after a fall; during her recovery, she found that she had trouble reading anything longer than a paragraph, so she moved her usual sports-media consumption over to Twitter. When she saw an article detailing the way Clancy and an army of Stoolies had responded to the Al Jazeera incident, Missy tweeted her support for the author of the article and women she felt had been abused online. Stoolies responded almost immediately, with three days of the usual misogynist epithets and vague threats. A year later, she says, after another comment critical of Barstool, a reader found photos she had posted memorializing a cousin who died of cancer \u2014 and reposted them on Twitter, tagging Barstool writers to do God knows what with them.There\u2019s a uniform response from Barstool employees about the worst of the Stoolies. \u201cI hate seeing it,\u201d Katz told me. \u201cBut it\u2019s just a few idiots who have nothing better to do, and it sucks that people use them to smear an entire company.\u201d The average Stoolie, Portnoy, Clancy and Markovich all argue, is not a misogynist abuser but has been painted with a broad brush by other media outlets. \u201cI\u2019m used to it by now,\u201d Nardini said of the constant negative press surrounding Barstool\u2019s attitudes toward women. \u201cEvery time anyone mentions us in the media, they\u2019re always going to write that requisite paragraph.\u201d She used to be part of a network of female executives, she told me, but \u201cafter they heard I was coming here, every single one of them dropped me like a bad habit.\u201dThe wrath of the Stoolies can occasionally extend to Barstool\u2019s own employees. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single day that would go by without me seeing the N-word in the comments,\u201d Maurice Peebles, Barstool\u2019s first black employee, told me. Peebles ran Barstool\u2019s Philadelphia page for three years. His administrator access allowed him to see that the racial slurs were coming mostly from a concentrated number of IP addresses, which meant that only a few readers were posting the slurs, and over time the site\u2019s filters became better at blocking them. But he doesn\u2019t absolve Barstool of all responsibility. \u201cThey could\u2019ve done more about it,\u201d he says. \u201cNone of the guys who worked at Barstool ever said anything racist to me, but I don\u2019t know if they all understand what it\u2019s like to see that word every day.\u201dBarstool\u2019s reputation \u201cwas certainly listed as a risk,\u201d Kerns says. \u201cBut I think time is on our side. The younger folks within agencies and brands get Barstool and recognize the world is increasingly taking itself less seriously.\u201d Over the past year, that time seemed to have already arrived. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, the advertiser most associated with Boston sports, had long been wary of dealing with Portnoy, but this year, Barstool dedicated an entire month to promoting the chain\u2019s new energy drink. Wendy\u2019s had also expressed hesitation to partner with Barstool, but this summer the company sponsored \u201cBarstool 5th Year,\u201d a Snapchat channel specifically targeted at college students.The question of whether Barstool should be held responsible for the worst behaviors of its fans reflects a fundamental question facing online media \u2014 the same one at the core of Facebook\u2019s issues with fake news, Twitter\u2019s with neo-Nazis and Reddit\u2019s with various toxic communities. Unlike those companies, Barstool can\u2019t hide behind the notion of being an open, neutral platform for the free speech of others. Its readers may come from all sorts of backgrounds, but the core Stoolies are an organic online community that grew under the caring, thoughtful hand of their very own El Presidente. Every new-media venture seeks out an \u201corganic online community\u201d like this \u2014 one that can, in Nardini\u2019s words, \u201cconvert content into commerce.\u201d That community could mean, say, subscribers of The Daily Skimm, an email for millennial women that recaps the news in a peppy, corporate voice. But it can also mean tribes of angry, disaffected young men who gather online to find shelter from the floodwaters of political correctness. This leaves companies like ESPN with a discomforting dilemma. Should they try to create their own communities \u2014 an almost impossible enterprise, especially with young audiences who have grown up on completely independent, unfiltered personalities on YouTube and social media? Or should they co-opt, sanitize and scale audiences like the Stoolies?The other road is to take the popular material that has been built since the Chernin acquisition and take another crack at entering media\u2019s mainstream. I have friends and relatives \u2014 the majority of whom would be considered progressive, many of whom are not white \u2014 who read Barstool regularly, like its videos on Instagram and listen to \u201cPardon My Take.\u201d Some are vaguely aware that Portnoy has said disturbing things about women, but they shrug it off in the same way they shrug off the cloud of bad news that continually engulfs the N.F.L. The vast majority of the Barstool content they consume ticks between standard-fare aggregation (funny videos, memes, weird stories from Florida) and genuinely enjoyable content aimed directly at men who, like me, grew up watching sports and went to colleges where we watched sports with our sports-watching friends.During the N.H.L. finals in June, I went to the Barstool offices to watch a recording of \u201cPardon My Take.\u201d Katz, who is not as fat as he claims to be on air, sat in a La-Z-Boy, idly watching hockey and scribbling notes. His co-host, who goes by the pseudonym PFT Commenter, tried out jokes about handshake lines and the superiority of the N.H.L. to the N.B.A. When the game ended, they settled on a list of segments and piled into a small recording studio, completely bare except for poorly stapled acoustic tiles and posters of Chris Berman and Lenny Dykstra.They rattled through the show without second takes or pauses, the jokes and banter falling into a familiar, rapid rhythm. Katz is the straight man; he is mostly playing himself, an affable dude who loves his Chicago sports and could easily slide into the chair of any ESPN opinion show. PFT Commenter, who has shoulder-length hair and wears Hawaiian shirts, has created a type of character that has never really been seen in sports media \u2014 a gag version of a commenter on the well-trafficked N.F.L. blog Pro Football Talk, his tweets and columns filled with the spelling errors, prejudices and leaps of logic that plague all open forums about sports. In 2015, covering the early part of the presidential campaign, in character, for SB Nation, he would pound airplane bottles of Fireball whiskey and walk straight into scrums of reporters; outside a Republican debate in Cleveland, he held up a sign behind Chris Matthews that read, \u201cIs Joe Flacco a ELITE Quaterback?\u201dAlmost everything about \u201cPardon My Take\u201d is a densely referential sports-fan in-joke. Even the title plays off two ESPN talk shows, \u201cPardon the Interruption\u201d and \u201cFirst Take.\u201d If you\u2019ve never watched Chris Berman run through a highlight reel or admired the sports-yelling talents of Stephen A. Smith, Katz and Commenter might as well be speaking a foreign language. But most sports fans have watched hundreds of hours of ESPN programming, absorbing all the tics, clich\u00e9s and motifs that Katz and Commenter have quilted together into a pitch-perfect satirical pidgin. One of its catchiest elements derives from the N.F.L.-coach habit of explaining some bit of masculine bluster by saying \u201cI\u2019m a football guy\u201d \u2014 in my time at Barstool, at least 70 percent of conversations seemed to include some deadpan variation on \u201cI\u2019m a huge [something] guy.\u201d This entertaining mix has attracted an impressive list of high-profile athletes and media figures to the show. Before the Chernin deal, Portnoy had not seen the value in producing podcasts, which he admitted to me was a \u201cbig mistake\u201d; now \u201cPardon My Take\u201d is Barstool\u2019s flagship product. Katz and Commenter were, until October, proof that Barstool could be scrubbed clean and scaled up.During our conversations, Portnoy kept bringing up \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d mentioning it as a model for Barstool. What he meant was that he wanted to create a broad cast of characters, each capable of his or her own independent success. Barstool has hired the ESPN sideline reporter Julie Stewart-Binks; Michael Rapaport, the character actor who hosts a popular podcast; the former major-league pitcher Dallas Braden; Pat McAfee, an N.F.L. punter who retired midcareer to sign with Portnoy; and Adam Ferrone, a battle-rap champion who told me that he pestered Barstool for two years for a job. By choosing Barstool, each seems to be signing on with the gospel of Portnoy: Say what\u2019s on your mind \u2014 and if anyone has a problem with it, fight back.Over the days to come, Portnoy and a handful of bloggers \u2014 alongside hundreds of Stoolie volunteers \u2014 scrubbed through the social-media accounts of women at ESPN who had spoken out about them, resurfacing every comment that was even slightly off-color. (\u201cI hate hypocrisy,\u201d Portnoy told me \u2014 and that image, of ugly honesty triumphing over hypocrisy, probably explains Barstool\u2019s appeal to young men better than any of its content.) A week later, Henry Lockwood, the producer of \u201cPardon My Take,\u201d tweeted that Britt McHenry had \u201ccankles,\u201d leading to another spat. It was as if Barstool was doubling down on being more Barstool than ever, even though ESPN wasn\u2019t the only partner that had been scared off: Portnoy told me another network had backed away from a deal, and that some advertisers had expressed concern.We talked about something that happened a few hours before ESPN\u2019s announcement, while Portnoy was recording one of his daily pizza reviews \u2014 a Barstool programming staple in which Portnoy tries to review every pizza joint in Manhattan. That day, his guest was Jake Paul, the 20-year-old YouTube heel who might be the only person on the internet better than Portnoy at turning hate and controversy into merchandising opportunities. \u201cPeople know I\u2019m a Jake Paul guy,\u201d Portnoy said. \u201cI respect people who take over the internet, and this guy has got maybe more haters than I do, which I also love.\u201d He ventured that \u201cif you put Team 10\u201d \u2014 the name of Paul\u2019s company \u2014 \u201cwith the Stoolies, I think we can bring down, like, the entire country.\u201dHe was joking, but if companies like ESPN want to corral the millions of young people who have cut cable cords, turned off \u201cSportsCenter\u201d and flocked to unfiltered and anarchic internet personalities, they will have to reckon with Jake Pauls and Dave Portnoys. The truth about ESPN\u2019s supposed bias will not really matter: A lot of people, like Ives the intern, believe that the Worldwide Leader in Sports no longer speaks to them. Their grievances, like those of the angry men who fume over the female cast of \u201cGhostbusters\u201d or ethics in video-game journalism, will seem absurdly petty, whether they\u2019re complaining about the rare yet somehow oppressive sight of a female sportscaster or the unbearable burden placed upon their consciences by a two-minute conversation about Colin Kaepernick. But they will voice these grievances online with enough volume and vitriol to worry even the most reasonable media executive. And if that executive doesn\u2019t bend to their will, they will seek out someone, anyone, who feels more authentic to their experience, whatever that may mean. For huge media conglomerates, this dynamic might matter only in the margins; ESPN surely has more immediate business concerns. But gains in media right now occur only in the margins. The market inefficiencies will not be ignored.In his office, I asked Portnoy why he thought ESPN had been interested in partnering with Barstool in the first place, given its past. A half-smile crept over his face. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s like that Batman quote,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a time of desperation, you turn to a man you don\u2019t fully understand.\u201dAn earlier version of this article about the media company Barstool Sports, relying on information from company representatives, misstated the circumstances under which one of its bloggers, Chris Spagnuolo, left the company last spring. Following a brief suspension, his departure occurred when the company and Spagnuolo could no longer agree on the terms of his continued employment. He was not fired.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft to Expand Campus, as Amazon Looks Elsewhere", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetThe project, which Microsoft plans to announce at its annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday, amounts to a major overhaul of the company\u2019s 500-acre campus in Redmond, Wash., the leafy Seattle suburb that it has called home since 1986.Amazon said it received 238 bids from across North America and is whittling down the list to a group of finalists, with a winner to be announced next year.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said the company did not intend for its hometown expansion \u2014 which he described as a multibillion-dollar investment \u2014 as a comment on Amazon. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re out to make a statement about what anyone else is doing or not doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is the right decision for us.\u201dStill, Mr. Smith could not resist a slight dig. \u201cWhen it comes to headquarters, one is enough, we feel,\u201d he said.Today Microsoft\u2019s Redmond campus has most of the trappings found at the sprawling headquarters of tech giants in Silicon Valley \u2014 the soccer fields, manicured lawns and oceans of parking lots. That will not change on its renovated campus, but Microsoft is taking a different approach in other respects.The new buildings will be clustered closer together. They will also be taller \u2014 four stories instead of the two or three that are common now. There will be a new underground parking facility, a 2-acre open plaza that will serve as a central gathering place and new walking and cycling trails.\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to build a somewhat denser campus and create a somewhat more urban feel,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The company\u2019s decision to stay put at its Redmond campus flies in the face of a trend among technology companies to gravitate closer to cities. The abundance of amenities, night life and public transportation in urban areas has led to thriving tech scenes in San Francisco, New York and other cities.\u201cMy gut reaction is, \u2018Wow, they seem kind of out of touch,\u2019\u201d said Dan Bertolet, a researcher at Sightline Institute, a nonprofit in Seattle focused on sustainability. \u201cAll the young people I know who work in the tech industry out there want to be in Seattle. They pooh-pooh places like Redmond.\u201dTech companies are also finding that the talent they are after increasingly wants to live in cities, not suburbs. That has led suburban giants like Google, Facebook and Apple to operate large private bus services to ferry workers to their headquarters. Microsoft\u2019s own bus service has more than 94 buses and over 4,000 daily riders.But those buses also frequently sit in soul-crushing traffic. Possible relief for Microsoft\u2019s commuters will come in the form of light-rail that will connect it to Seattle. A light-rail station on Microsoft\u2019s campus is scheduled to open by 2023.Had Microsoft decided to move to Seattle rather than remain in the suburbs, the company would likely have faced severe criticism from affordability advocates, who are worried about lower income residents getting pushed out of the city.Mr. Bertolet said suburban areas outside Seattle tend to restrict the density of housing so they\u2019re not likely to develop an urban atmosphere without significant change. \u201cMaybe in the long term,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s better to have a regional network of bigger cities, but getting there will be rough.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Not the Bots We Were Looking For", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyBut despite the tech industry\u2019s efforts and hopes, the bots that have most effectively lodged themselves in the public\u2019s consciousness over the last year were not here to help \u2014 at least, not us. A different sort of bot \u2014 undercover but public-facing, highly political but comparatively primitive \u2014 was implicated in toxic and disorienting online conversations throughout the 2016 election cycle. Before the election, researchers at Oxford University suggested that between the first and second presidential debates, more than a third of pro-Trump tweets and almost a fifth of pro-Clinton tweets came from bot accounts. Political social bots have been stealing headlines ever since, described variously as \u201cfake Americans,\u201d as \u201cweaponized\u201d and as \u201cfake-news-disseminating\u201d agents of Russia.Such motive-centric descriptions tend to give too much credit to the influence bots. Mostly they are crude imitations of regular, if single-minded, people that, by virtue of existing and posting \u2014 a lot \u2014 are able to manipulate platforms\u2019 shared spaces: They increase visible follower counts and sharing metrics; they create Twitter trends and hijack or pollute hashtags into uselessness; they flood searches around breaking news. They probably don\u2019t follow you, and you probably don\u2019t follow them, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. They find their strength in numbers. They thrive just out of sight but fully within earshot.This type of bot bears little resemblance to the ones demonstrated on the stages of tech campus auditoriums. But each sort of bot is made, in its own way, to exploit untapped opportunity in large-scale automation. Where commercial bot-makers see an almost-too-good-to-be-true chance to simultaneously personify their brands and automate their businesses, political bot-makers see an opportunity to exploit anonymity with a humanlike touch at an inhuman scale. While tech companies stand proudly behind their bots, the people who create prolific and ideological social bots hide behind them. (Their provenance remains murky even today.)But the proximity is toxic, and custody of the word is slipping. Bots, it turns out, make an excellent foil. Angela Merkel, in the run-up to this year\u2019s German federal election, talked about bots, generally, as if they were an invading army. In May, Hillary Clinton pointed to Russia-backed online efforts \u2014 including \u201cthe bots\u201d \u2014 as \u201cjust out of control.\u201d The phrase \u201cnot a bot\u201d now litters the profiles of politically engaged Twitter users (and, presumably, some bots). At the same time, President Trump, or a staff member, has indulged a habit of wandering into Twitter\u2019s uncanny valley to retweet supportive accounts whose humanity is hard to discern, or which eventually and mysteriously just disappear.Social automation is both disruptive and revealing. Twitter in particular dehumanizes users in the process of giving them access to one another, so of course bots could thrive there \u2014 and of course they\u2019d closely resemble our worst-tweeting selves. Voice-and-text-activated assistants help monopolistic companies further consolidate power, and they complicate the stories we tell ourselves about privacy, as we invite the eyes and ears of the world\u2019s most ambitious tech businesses into our most personal spaces. Alexa reminds us what Amazon wants; Twitter bots show us how online mass communication breaks down. What was truly great about Hubot, the cobbled-together, inscrutable, mostly useless chat automaton, was the suggestion it made, through each absurd routine: that online, it\u2019s necessary that we build spaces for ourselves.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egon Schiele Is Still Too Racy for Some, Nearly 100 Years After His Death", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIENNA \u2014 It\u2019s been nearly a century since the Austrian painter Egon Schiele died, but his art \u2014 charged with erotic energy and usually showing more than a little skin \u2014 still ruffles feathers.A series of advertisements showing Schiele\u2019s graphically contorted bodies (with explicitly rendered private parts) didn\u2019t make it past the critical eyes of those selling advertising space in Britain and Germany \u2014 nor the anti-nudity restrictions on Facebook. The artworks had to be covered up.Both Schiele and his mentor, the painter Gustav Klimt, died in 1918, the same year World War I and the Austro-Hungarian empire ended. In 2018, museums in Vienna will mount a yearlong series of exhibitions and events to mark the centennial: \u201cStairway to Klimt\u201d begins at Vienna\u2019s Kunsthistorisches Museum on Feb. 13; \u201cEgon Schiele, Expression and Lyricism\u201d opens at the Leopold Museum on Feb. 23.Vienna\u2019s Tourist Board has also been working on a campaign celebrating these and other big-draw exhibitions, and Viennese modernism in general. But the campaign ran into an unusual glitch \u2014 the office\u2019s originally planned posters, featuring large Schiele nudes, turned out to be too racy.According to a Vienna Tourist Board spokeswoman, Helena Hartlauer, Transport for London rejected the original images, citing trepidation about depicting genitals in public space.Ms. Hartlauer said that modified advertisements with pixelated genitals were also declined. Ultimately approved were versions using the same artworks (Schiele\u2019s \u201cSeated Male Nude (Self-Portrait),\u201d 1910, and \u201cGirl With Orange Stockings,\u201d 1914, and other paintings by the artist, all from the Leopold Museum collection), but with certain bits covered by a banner.The banner reads: \u201cSORRY, 100 years old but still too daring today.\u201d The modified images are now on view on bus shelters in Cologne and building facades in Hamburg, and, since this week, in tube stops in London.\u201cWe wondered, How much Viennese modernism is bearable today?\u201d said Norbert Kettner, chief executive of the Vienna Tourist Board. Apparently for the British and Germans, less than the Austrians anticipated.In some ways, the no-nude attitudes abroad have been a blessing in disguise for Vienna\u2019s campaign \u2014 since early November the Tourist Board has been highlighting images of the public ads with the hashtag #DerKunstihreFreiheit (#ToArtItsFreedom in English) on social media.The hashtag comes from the slogan \u201cTo every age its art, to art its freedom,\u201d still visible in German on the facade of the Viennese Secession, an exhibition venue co-founded by Klimt in 1897 and still operating today as an autonomous artist-run institution. And the controversy certainly echoes discussions that took place in Schiele\u2019s time. In fin-de-si\u00e8cle Vienna, an era of dramatic shifts in both art and society, many considered the artist\u2019s work to be pornographic. Schiele\u2019s first broader acceptance didn\u2019t come until early 1918 with a major exhibition in the Secession \u2014 later that year, the artist succumbed to Spanish flu at age 28.\u201cWe want to show people just how far ahead of their time Vienna and its protagonists really were,\u201d Mr. Kettner said. \u201cAnd also encourage the audience to scrutinize how much really has \u2014 or hasn\u2019t \u2014 changed in terms of openness and attitudes in society over the times.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Every so often, I would move the bottle out of the way to wipe crumbs off the counter, but I didn\u2019t dare twist open the top. I knew once I did, I\u2019d end up pouring it compulsively on everything.Vying for attention next to the regular olive oils \u2014 the good one for saut\u00e9ing, the better one for salads and garnishes \u2014 it lured me with the promise of containing two of my favorite ingredients, olives and lemons pressed together into a golden oil.And at upward of $35 for a rather small bottle, it would become yet another expensive staple in my already pricey pantry. (I\u2019m looking at you, aged balsamic.)It was a bowl of escarole, green and succulent, that made me relent. A slick of lemon olive oil, along with some grated garlic and a pinch of chile flakes, was exactly what it was begging for. The combination of the greens\u2019 snappy bite and the oil\u2019s fragrant tang was bright and deep.What makes lemon olive oil taste so intense is that, unlike my workaday salad dressing of lemon juice and olive oil, it doesn\u2019t display the sharpness of citrus juice. Instead, it\u2019s all about the heady oil from the lemon zest along with olive oil. And, while it does contain some acidity, it\u2019s a lot more subtle.As predicted, once I opened it, I couldn\u2019t get enough of the stuff.Luckily, lemon olive oil turns out to be very easy and economical to make at home. While it may not be quite as nuanced as the cold-pressed stuff in the bottle, it\u2019s still richly citrusy and perfumed, and a jar of it will last a month. It\u2019s fantastic on salads, pastas, fish and my current obsession, avocado-anchovy toast.Here, I pair the oil with mackerel, one of the most underrated fish I know. Pale-fleshed and much more delicate than people think, it has more character than, say, your average ultra-mild white fish, like flounder. But it\u2019s a lot gentler and less fatty than everyone\u2019s beloved salmon \u2014 and it\u2019s more sustainable.The tender fish, roasted along with olives, basil and cherry tomatoes, makes a zippy dish perfect for any given weeknight \u2014 whether you\u2019re cracking open a bottle of store-bought lemon olive oil, or making your own.And to Drink \u2026cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Laptops Are Great. But Not During a Lecture or a Meeting.", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewStep into any college lecture hall and you are likely to find a sea of students typing away at open, glowing laptops as the professor speaks. But you won\u2019t see that when I\u2019m teaching.Though I make a few exceptions, I generally ban electronics, including laptops, in my classes and research seminars.That may seem extreme. After all, with laptops, students can, in some ways, absorb more from lectures than they can with just paper and pen. They can download course readings, look up unfamiliar concepts on the fly and create an accurate, well-organized record of the lecture material. All of that is good.But a growing body of evidence shows that over all, college students learn less when they use computers or tablets during lectures. They also tend to earn worse grades. The research is unequivocal: Laptops distract from learning, both for users and for those around them. It\u2019s not much of a leap to expect that electronics also undermine learning in high school classrooms or that they hurt productivity in meetings in all kinds of workplaces.Measuring the effect of laptops on learning is tough. One problem is that students don\u2019t all use laptops the same way. It might be that dedicated students, who tend to earn high grades, use them more frequently in classes. It might be that the most distracted students turn to their laptops whenever they are bored. In any case, a simple comparison of performance may confuse the effect of laptops with the characteristics of the students who choose to use them. Researchers call this \u201cselection bias.\u201dResearchers can solve that problem by randomly assigning some students to use laptops. With that approach, the students who use laptops are comparable in all other ways to those who don\u2019t.The researchers hypothesized that, because students can type faster than they can write, the lecturer\u2019s words flowed right to the students\u2019 typing fingers without stopping in their brains for substantive processing. Students writing by hand had to process and condense the spoken material simply to enable their pens to keep up with the lecture. Indeed, the notes of the laptop users more closely resembled transcripts than lecture summaries. The handwritten versions were more succinct but included the salient issues discussed in the lecture.Even so, it may seem heavy-handed to ban electronics in the classroom. Most college students are legal adults who can serve in the armed forces, vote and own property. Why shouldn\u2019t they decide themselves whether to use a laptop?The economic term for such a spillover is a \u201cnegative externality,\u201d which occurs when one person\u2019s consumption harms the well-being of others. The classic negative externality is pollution: A factory burning coal or a car using gasoline can harm the air and environment for those around it. A laptop can sometimes be a form of visual pollution: Those nearby see its screen, and their attention is pulled toward its enticements, which often include not just note-taking but Facebook, Twitter, email and news.These experiments go only so far. They may not capture positive effects of laptops in real classrooms over the course of a semester, when students use their typed notes for review and grades are at stake. But another study did just that.You might question whether the experience of military cadets learning economics is relevant to students in other settings \u2014 say, community college students learning Shakespeare. But we\u2019d expect the negative effects of laptops to be, if anything, less at West Point, where all courses are taught in small sections, than it is at institutions with many large lectures. Further, cadets have very strong incentives to perform well and avoid distractions, since class rank has a major impact on their job status after graduation.The best way to settle this question is probably to study laptop use in more colleges. But until then, I find the evidence sufficiently compelling that I\u2019ve made my decision: I ban electronics in my own classes.I do make one major exception. Students with learning disabilities may use electronics in order to participate in class. This does reveal that any student using electronics has a learning disability. That is a loss of privacy for those students, which also occurs when they are given more time to complete a test. Those negatives must be weighed against the learning losses of other students when laptops are used in class.Students may object that a laptop ban prevents them from storing notes on their computers. But smartphones can snap pictures of handwritten pages and convert them to an electronic format. Even better, outside class, students can read their own handwritten notes and type them, if they like, a process that enhances learning.The best evidence available now suggests that students should avoid laptops during lectures and just pick up their pens. It\u2019s not a leap to think that the same holds for middle and high school classrooms, as well as for workplace meetings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Signs of Russian Meddling in Brexit Referendum", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 More than 150,000 Russian-language Twitter accounts posted tens of thousands of messages in English urging Britain to leave the European Union in the days before last year\u2019s referendum on the issue, a team of researchers disclosed on Wednesday.More than 400 of the accounts that Twitter has already identified to congressional investigators as tools of the Kremlin, other researchers said, also posted divisive messages about Britain\u2019s decision on withdrawing from the bloc, or Brexit, both before and after the vote.Most of the messages sought to inflame fears about Muslims and immigrants to help drive the vote, suggesting parallels to the strategy that Russian propagandists employed in the United States in the 2016 election to try to intensify the polarization of the electorate.The separate findings amount to the strongest evidence yet of a Russian attempt to use social media to manipulate British politics in the same way the Kremlin has done in the United States, France and elsewhere.On Tuesday, the chief of the National Cyber Security Center released a summary of a prepared speech asserting that in the past 12 months, Russian hackers had unleashed cyberattacks on the British energy grid and the telecommunications and media industries.Any evidence that Moscow did, however, may also complicate the already vexed politics surrounding the issue.But the British government, consumed by the negotiations for an exit from the European Union, has not yet obtained similar disclosures. Although a parliamentary committee recently asked the social media companies for information, many critics have argued that the government has little appetite for an inquiry that could muddy its mandate.The social media companies, including Facebook, Twitter and Google, have had little incentive to volunteer information about the exploitation of their own platforms. And the predominantly right-wing, pro-Brexit British press, particularly the powerful tabloids, have little enthusiasm for undermining the validity of the referendum.The researchers, Oleksandr Talavera and Tho Pham, of Swansea University in Wales, said in interviews on Wednesday that the Russian accounts, which had posted very little about Brexit in the month before the referendum, became quite active at the last minute: from about 1,000 a day two weeks before the vote to 45,000 in the last 48 hours and 39,000 on the day the results were announced, June 24, 2016.\u201cIt is very strange that someone whose language is Russian tweets in English,\u201d Ms. Pham said \u2014 describing it as an anomaly that had prompted the researchers to look more closely at 10 of the most active accounts under suspicion.Nine had been deleted, and the last, Sveta1972, appeared to emanate from a Russian resort town. On the eve of the referendum, Sveta1972 urged Britain to \u201cmake June the 23rd our Independence Day.\u201dThey found that 419 of the 2,752 accounts already identified by Twitter to congressional committees as being linked to the Kremlin had posted 3,500 times using Brexit hashtags.More than 70 percent of those posts were after the vote, but 38 of the accounts tweeted a total of 400 times on the day of the vote, said Laura Cram, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, who conducted the study with her colleague, Clare Llewellyn.Researchers study Twitter for indications of broader patterns in social media, because information about its users and contents is more accessible than in the larger but less-open platforms like Facebook. But without the disclosure of more information from the companies, social scientists said, neither of the findings disclosed this week will provide conclusive evidence of a deliberate Kremlin campaign to influence the Brexit vote or other British elections.Ms. Cram, for example, noted that Russian propagandists might have used hashtags related to Brexit only because they fit with protectionist, nativist or anti-Muslim themes that resonated in the context of the American election, as well.\u201cThese accounts were definitely using Brexit hashtags,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we cannot say whether they were primarily trying to influence Brexit or whether it was a side effect of them trying to wreak discord generally.\u201d\u201cMany of these accounts strongly pushed the narrative that all Muslims should be equated with terrorists and made the case that Muslims should be banned from Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is very consistent with the Russian strategy on U.S. issues, and the fact that they were using the same tactics to target Europeans is extremely telling.\u201dRaphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter, It\u2019s Time to End Your Anything-Goes Paradise", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWeirdly, the world didn\u2019t end. There was some whining from old-timers, which quickly died out. Mostly, everything was O.K. Some might even say the change was for the better.There\u2019s a lesson in this for Twitter: It should be bolder in how it manages its network. It can slay more sacred cows. And after a year in which it became blindingly obvious that Twitter was rife with abuse and harassment, and that it has become a haven for propagandists, bots and other manipulators, there\u2019s one sacred cow in particular that deserves to be roasted more thoroughly than your Thanksgiving bird.It\u2019s time for Twitter to scrap one of its founding principles: the idea that it is an anything-goes paradise, where anyone who signs up for a voice on its platform is immediately and automatically given equal footing with everyone else, and where even the vilest, most hateful and antisocial behavior should be tolerated.It ought to consider a radical, top-to-bottom change like this: Instead of awarding blue checks to people who achieve some arbitrary level of real-world renown, the company should issue badges of status or of shame based on signals about how people actually use, or abuse, Twitter. In other words, Twitter should begin to think of itself, and its users, as a community, and it should look to the community for determining the rights of people on the platform.Is someone making a positive contribution to the service, for example by posting well-liked content and engaging in meaningful conversations? Is an account repeatedly spreading misinformation? Is it promoting or participating in online mobs, especially mobs directed at people with fewer followers? Did it just sign up two days ago? Is it acting more like a bot than a human? Are most of its tweets anti-Semitic memes? Can the account be validated with other markers of online reputation \u2014 a Facebook account or a LinkedIn profile, for instance? And on and on.Twitter should not just embrace such reputational guidelines, it should make them transparent and meaningful. If you\u2019re new to Twitter, or if you\u2019ve repeatedly flouted its community rules, your rights on the platform would be circumscribed. Perhaps you wouldn\u2019t show up in other people\u2019s timelines or replies or search results. The better you used the service \u2014 where \u201cbetter\u201d is determined, as much as possible, based on how others react to your account \u2014 the more status you\u2019d earn, and the more you\u2019d be allowed to do.\u201cYou set up a system that encourages positive behaviors, and discourages others \u2014 so all of a sudden people see that the more trusted you are, the more reach you get,\u201d said Anil Dash, a software executive in New York who has spent years creating and managing online communities, and who floated the broad outlines of this plan in a recent interview.Mr. Dash suggested that instead of a blue check mark, everyone might start out with, say, a gray one. But as you gained trust and rights on the network, your check mark would change color \u2014 it\u2019d turn blue, then green, then perhaps gold. Status would be something you could earn and could lose, rather than something you\u2019d be awarded by Twitter from on high.\u201cIt becomes a positive dynamic,\u201d Mr. Dash said.Twitter declined to discuss how it might change its verification system, and there are many questions about how such a plan might work. Before we get to those, let\u2019s deal with the two most obvious criticisms of this idea. One: Who cares? Two: Isn\u2019t Twitter supposed to be a bastion of free speech?\u201cWho cares?\u201d is a fair question. Twitter\u2019s user base is tiny compared with Facebook or Instagram, and its arcane conventions and the generally combative, depressive hellscape that is much of its content deters most normal people. But because it is catnip for journalists (including yours truly), who think of it as a fast feed of news and commentary, Twitter exerts influence beyond its numbers.Twitter now concedes that its system for mitigating some of these problems, the verification badge, has been badly mismanaged. The blue check system started out as a simple way to verify a person\u2019s identity \u2014 a kind of trademark for ensuring that a tweet from an account with the name Donald J. Trump had come from the real Donald J. Trump.But Twitter\u2019s system for giving out the checks was never very transparent or logical. Dozens of Twitter users told me that they\u2019d been denied check marks for reasons that were never explained. (I got mine when I worked at Slate, whose social media team had a connection with Twitter; in this business, it\u2019s all about who you know.)Twitter has since muddied the meaning of the blue badge. It has come to convey more than just an ID check; Twitter has rolled out special features to verified accounts, and blue check-marked tweets receive special treatment from its algorithms. This confounded Twitter\u2019s efforts to police the network: On one hand, it was trying to fight abuse; on the other, it was verifying trolls who routinely directed their followers to harass people.At the core of this problem is confusion over what kind of network Twitter should be. Twitter\u2019s founders always talk about the service as a kind of public square, where everyone should be able to have a more or less unfettered voice. That\u2019s a misguided analogy, because it misses the nuances of the real world.Even a real public square imposes limits on how people can behave. Sure, the sign-wielding crazy guy is free to stand up on a crate and spout his nonsense \u2014 but you\u2019re free to ignore him, and if you do, he\u2019s not allowed to marshal all his acolytes (or to invent new ones) to follow and harass you. More than that, in the real world, we have many ways of determining who is worth listening to and who isn\u2019t; there are body language, ways of speaking, ways of dressing and an overall history \u2014 an earned reputation that determines a person\u2019s place in the community.It wouldn\u2019t be easy to recreate such a system on Twitter. The company faces Wall Street pressure to gain more users; imposing checks on people would most likely frustrate that effort. Twitter would also have to have frank discussions about which behaviors it considered beneficial and which it didn\u2019t \u2014 and it would have to explain and defend those decisions to those whose trust it has repeatedly broken.But what choice does it have? Twitter, as it is now, isn\u2019t working well for anyone.\u201cWould it get complicated? Of course it would, but that\u2019s the nature of running a business that\u2019s not negligent,\u201d said Sarah Szalavitz, the chief executive of 7 Robot, a design agency, who has long criticized Twitter\u2019s efforts to police itself. \u201cAt the moment, I think they\u2019re doing harm, and they know it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is the Age of the Artistic Recluse Over?", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIN THE EARLY 1880S, a recent arrival to Amherst, Mass., gossiped in a letter about her neighbor, \u201ca lady whom the people call the Myth. She is a sister of Mr. Dickinson, & seems to be the climax of all the family oddity. She has not been outside of her own house in fifteen years.\u201d The details were tantalizing: \u201cShe dresses wholly in white, & her mind is said to be perfectly wonderful. She writes finely, but no one ever sees her.\u201dMore than a century later, a gentleman in Yonkers wrote an article for his local paper about a man named Don DeLillo, who lived on the same street and whom he\u2019d often run into while walking his dog. \u201cDeLillo didn\u2019t seem all that approachable,\u201d he noted of the author, admitting he was more of a Carl Hiaasen fan. \u201cOh, he\u2019d nod and smile faintly when we passed on the parkway bridge leading to Bronxville. But serious writers don\u2019t advertise their presence. They tend to be quiet, solitary types who fight internal battles. You don\u2019t want to bug them during their death struggle with writer\u2019s block.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to say when, precisely, the myth of artistic reclusiveness finally lost its luster \u2014 certainly before Sia came out from behind her wig, or even before Thomas Pynchon, the last of our great literary recluses, voiced himself on \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on two episodes in 2004 drawn with a bag over his head. (The irony, of course, is that if Pynchon simply had a recent author photo \u2014 the only known portraits of him are from the 1950s \u2014 no one would really care about unmasking him anymore.)Now that we have terms like social anxiety disorder and agoraphobia and drugs like Paxil, retiring to one\u2019s bedchamber feels less Emily Dickinson, more hikikomori. It\u2019s all too easy to believe the age of the artistic recluse is over, given that most artists now cultivate a cyclical relationship with the spotlight, intermittently stepping into and receding from it. It\u2019s almost impossible for the artist not to engage with the public today, and so the standards of privacy have lowered. These days, using a painting of yourself as an album cover (Lorde) or limiting press interviews (Frank Ocean) seems to count as mystery.But what has increased in the age of distraction is our concern for the necessary conditions in which art could flourish. No longer can the world be kept at bay with the closing of a door; Woolf\u2019s room of her own is now wired for internet. To look at my shelves of favorite novels written in feverish solitude and think that they might never have come to pass is also to know there must be many more today that are simply not being written. And so the greater truths found in solitude \u2014 in nature, like the Romantics\u2019 \u201cthoughts of more deep seclusion,\u201d or in a country in which you don\u2019t speak the language, in which no one knows your name \u2014 have never felt more rare and hard-won. The hermit sits alone no longer; he has a Facebook page to update.What has endured in the act of creation is the idea of getting lost in order to be found in art. This negotiation can also go terribly wrong: Nell Stevens\u2019s darkly funny memoir, \u201cBleaker House,\u201d recounts the six weeks she spent in one of the most remote parts of the Falkland Islands with the hopes of writing a novel, only to find herself watching \u201cEat Pray Love\u201d over and over again and making lists of things she would Google if she could. Isolation has a way of becoming its own subject. But then I think of Howard Axelrod\u2019s \u201cThe Point of Vanishing,\u201d the extraordinary book he wrote about the two years he spent alone in a wooded Vermont cabin after losing the vision in one eye. \u201cSome people say solitude is their biggest fantasy; some say it\u2019s their biggest fear,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cBut when I ask why, they all give the same reason: hearing themselves think.\u201dThe desire to uncover our one true voice, the dread of hearing what it has to say: This seems to me the tension of modern life, the thing that has us searching for a cell signal on yoga retreat. Being in a place where nothing has an agenda for your attention, as Axelrod found, means looking and listening in an unguarded way. \u201cNatural curiosities and affinities emerge,\u201d as he puts it, \u201cbecoming the filters for experience.\u201d How we breathe in the world, then, defaults to a function of an unbidden part of identity, rather than a function of what others want us to be \u2014 or, perhaps even more crucially, how we want others to think we are.Elena Ferrante, the Italian author whose pseudonymity became part of her mystique, once wrote to me in an email interview, \u201cIf my book were publicly mine from the beginning, I would be careful not to damage my image, I would censor myself.\u201d Writing was a \u201cbattle against lying. Only with the confidence of anonymity can I decide occasionally to publish. In the end, if I\u2019m forced to choose, I prefer to lose the role of writer rather than spoil my passion for writing \u2014 that\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been.\u201d When she was allegedly unmasked by an Italian investigative journalist, her fans were outraged at the violation. It was invasive, they argued, which it was, but it seemed to me that not only were they defending Ferrante from the indignity of having her financial and real-estate records unveiled, they were also defending their own right not to know, to be free to imagine that she was, in fact, Elena Greco, the narrator of her Neapolitan Novels, the woman they knew with the intimacy and deep interiority only possible in literature.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Pair With That Thanksgiving Bird, Consider Beer", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn all the meticulous course planning for Thanksgiving, wine tends to get top billing on the beverage list. But beer \u2014 with its versatility, approachability, carbonation and broad range of flavors \u2014 may be just as happy a pairing.While hoppy I.P.A.s seem to get all the attention from American beer drinkers these days, our rich holiday fare makes winter a time to celebrate the profoundly uncool, forgotten styles of continental Europe. The dishes of Thanksgiving call for beers that are medium-bodied, neither summery nor heavily roasted.Opt for bready flavors over hop bombs, as hoppy bitterness is better for spicy or sharply flavored foods. Rather than getting swept up by beers with kitschy additives like fruit or spice, stick to age-old standbys that harmonize with the food rather than upstage it.And don\u2019t worry that beer will leave you feeling too full. These styles can satisfy with sips instead of gulps, and have less alcohol than wine.Here are some general principles and a few good picks for your dinner this year.While your guests graze, start with something light and easy to drink. This is a good time for dry, grassy, European-style hops. Used judiciously in a sharp, golden lager, they whet the appetite without bowling you over with big flavors or alcohol; these tend to clock in at 4 to 5.5 percent A.B.V. (alcohol by volume).Don\u2019t be afraid of cans \u2014 they\u2019re the vessel of choice for many innovative breweries, and they chill down more quickly than glass bottles.For the main event, stock up on big bottles (750 milliliters) in two styles, and let guests pour for themselves. This lets them try both, allowing an option without overwhelming a table already filled with attractions.A dozen tools reviewed by Wirecutter to improve your Thanksgiving feast.On the light end, look for classic saisons, also called farmhouse ales. They have a spicelike tingle thanks to Belgian yeast, with no actual spices added. For the meal, you\u2019ll want a beer that\u2019s heftier than for the appetizers, in the range of 6 to 8 percent A.B.V., which will lend enough body to stand up to gravy and sweet potatoes.On the dark end, weizenbock is your secret weapon, a beer that will pair with everything on the holiday table. It\u2019s a cross between a hefeweizen (German wheat beer) and a doppelbock (a strong brown lager), and its caramel sweetness is braced by faint acidity from the wheat and the frothy, celebratory carbonation.Beer with dessert is tricky, unless you stick to the basics. Imperial stouts, rich and roasty ales that can exceed 10 percent A.B.V., are one of the few styles that have enough sweetness to match a pumpkin or pecan pie. Skip today\u2019s trendier imperial stouts, which are often laden with gobs of heady vanilla and coconut. Try stouts brewed with coffee, or even better, with no frills at all.Banish all hand-wringing over glassware. The appeal of specialized beer glasses is largely aesthetic; short of a champagne flute, there\u2019s scarcely a vessel that will make for a bad sip. Wineglasses are a nice choice because their small size invites guests to taste different beers, even switching between beer and wine if you\u2019re serving both.The ideal serving temperature for the beers mentioned here is around 45 to 55 degrees. If you pull them from the refrigerator when the turkey comes out the of the oven, they\u2019re safe to keep tableside the rest of the night.When you shop, as with any beer, buy only at stores that keep their inventory refrigerated. The styles listed here are slow sellers, so if the beer has been sitting around for a few months, make sure it\u2019s been kept properly.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Policeman\u2019s Bear Hug Stops a Suicide Bomber From Killing More", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 No one will ever know what went through the mind of Afghan Police Lt. Sayed Basam Pacha in those moments when he came face to face with a man he suspected of being a suicide bomber on Thursday afternoon, but whatever it was, he did not hesitate to act.At his back was a crowd of civilians, many of them dignitaries, leaving the hall he was guarding. Around him were officers from the police company he commanded. The suspect had just approached their heavily guarded gate, the only way in or out of the compound around the hall.Broad-shouldered and heavily muscled, Lieutenant Pacha shouted at the suspect to halt, but instead the man started running. The officer stopped him, throwing his arms around him in a bear hug.A second later the bomber detonated the explosive vest hidden under his coat. Fourteen people, including Lieutenant Pacha and seven other police officers as well as six civilians, were killed; 18 others were wounded, seven police and 11 civilians, said Basir Mujahed, a police spokesman.There was little doubt the death toll would have been far higher without the lieutenant\u2019s body blunting the blast, Mr. Mujahed said.\u201cHe\u2019s a hero, he saved many lives,\u201d he said. \u201cAll seven of those policemen are heroes but especially him. Just think if that suicide attacker got past the gate, what would have happened \u2014 you cannot even imagine.\u201dLieutenant Pacha\u2019s father, Gen. Sayed Nizam Agha, is also a police commander.\u201cMy son sacrificed himself to save other people,\u201d General Agha said, proud but tearful when reached by telephone. He wept as he recounted his son\u2019s story.\u201cHe had two bachelor degrees, one in political science and another one at the police academy,\u201d the father said. \u201cHe studied five years in Turkey. He came back from Turkey a year and a half ago. He was 25 years old and he was single. He has three brothers and one sister. He and I are the only police in our family. He was a very sporty guy.\u201dWeight lifting was his sport, his friends said.The general apologized and said he could not keep talking any longer; he was too overcome with emotion. He had one last thing to say though.\u201cI lost my bodyguard in this incident as well,\u201d the general said.He had assigned the bodyguard to assist his son at the event, which many high-profile political figures were attending. \u201cHe was my bodyguard for the last 15 years, he was like my son,\u201d General Agha said. \u201cHis name was Noor Agha, he left three children behind.\u201dTwo journalists for Rah-e-Farda Radio and Television were also caught up in the attack, said an anchorman at the station, Ramazan Abdullahzada. A reporter, Taqi Sadid, was in critical condition and a cameraman, Hussain Nazari, was missing, he said.\u201cWe checked all the private hospitals and public hospitals, but couldn\u2019t find him,\u201d Mr. Abdullahzada said. \u201cNow we are in front of the police hospital. I hope he will be here.\u201d\u201cHe was always worried about victims, but he never thought that one day he would get killed,\u201d said his longtime friend, Sayed Najib Asil, a producer at Tolo Television.If the lieutenant had a chance in the final moments of his life to look back on it, Mr. Asil said what would have stood out was his passion for higher education \u2014 he wanted to continue advanced studies in Britain \u2014 and his determination to stay in Afghanistan long-term.\u201cHe wanted to make changes here, he had an opportunity to leave and go live abroad, but he rejected it,\u201d Mr. Asil said. \u201cHe really hated corruption, and felt bad when people assumed that all policemen are corrupt.\u201dLieutenant Pacha was not someone who would have faced death fatalistically, as his friends told it.\u201cHe had very big dreams for himself,\u201d Mr. Asil said. \u201cHe wanted to be a general like his father, and maybe one day a high ministry official.\u201dThe characteristic his friends most noted, though, was his cheerfulness. Every week or two he and his friends had a party together. \u201cHe was always the cheeriest guy in the party, making everyone else happy,\u201d Mr. Asil said.If Lieutenant Pacha had been less conscientious, he might have missed the attack altogether.During the long afternoon event, Lieutenant Pacha had gone into the hall to drink tea with some of the guests, but then said he wanted to return to the gate as people started to leave, a witness said.The owner of the hall told him to finish his tea, but he said he had to check on his men, according to the witness. Lieutenant Pacha returned just as the suicide bomber arrived; people saw him challenge and then bear hug the attacker.Mr. Asil said his friend\u2019s split-second decision was to be expected. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised when I heard he had hugged the suicide attacker,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a very brave guy.\u201dJawad Sukhanyar and Fatima Faizi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

However, the Russians would not have been able to attempt this subversion had these issues not already been exploited, for many decades, by unscrupulous domestic entities in our politics and media.Future Russian efforts may be thwarted best by a move toward decency in American politics. Regrettably, that is not an easily attainable goal.ALAN S. WEINER, YONKERSTo the Editor:It is clear from the materials released by Facebook and Twitter that, leading up to the 2016 election, Russia engaged in a campaign to divide the American voting public. The frustration of members of Congress conducting hearings into these efforts is certainly understandable. This country is clearly polarized, and the ads purchased by Kremlin-linked entities are troubling.More worrisome, however, is the divisive conduct during Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and his continued efforts since taking office to fan the divisions in this country with his bullying racist, misogynistic, hate-encouraging tweets and rallies. This effort, mirroring the documented efforts of Russia and never before undertaken by a president, certainly appears to be collusion, stupidity, evidence of a deeply flawed character or a combination of these.No matter how one looks at it, though, it does not bode well for our country. It is time for Congress to turn its attention to the biggest threat to our democracy, and stand up for the values and standards that made America great before this administration came into power.ROBERT M. LEVINE, NEW YORKTo the Editor:After raking tech executives over the coals over Russia\u2019s use of social media to influence the presidential campaign, Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters, \u201cWhat we need to do is sit down and find ways to bring some of the controls we have on over-the-air broadcast to social media to protect the consumer.\u201dAs a scholar who studies First Amendment issues and the ways in which campaign finance laws have been used to stifle speech under the pretext of safeguarding democracy, I get very nervous when politicians discuss the need for \u201ccontrols\u201d over the media to \u201cprotect\u201d us.

But unlike Mr. Ricketts, who closed his unprofitable sites a week after the staff voted to unionize, they have found ways to stay in business telling the stories considered too small for the major newspapers to bother with.And even as they mourn the demise of DNAinfo and Gothamist, they sense an opportunity. \u201cAfter it happened I had all these people telling me this is your chance to fill that gap even more,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Conde said.\u201cAll of a sudden there was no power and no one knew what was going on,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe had information like \u2018Whole Foods has a generator so you can go and charge your phone.\u2019 People suddenly saw how useful a neighborhood news site can be.\u201dAs of Friday, such efforts enjoyed the support, at least rhetorically, of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who blasted Mr. Ricketts as \u201cundemocratic\u201d for closing down \u201cmedia outlets that people depend on for information, for perspective, to keep democracy thriving.\u201dBut plaudits don\u2019t pay the bills.Mr. Torkells tries to turn the fact that his ads reach only a small local audience into a selling point. \u201cI tell people if you want to reach TriBeCans, you come to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you open a preschool here and you want to get the attention of the people who are living there who have young children, a neighborhood website is far and away the best way to do it.\u201dBut the pressure is unrelenting.

You silently pray that you don\u2019t see anyone you know. You get good at the thousand-yard stare, waiting for your session to begin.The therapist and her receptionist rushed over to separate the two patients, as if they might be irreparably scarred if they came in contact with each other. The therapist told Mr. Hertwig later that in all her years practicing, she had never seen anything like it. But, as Mr. Hertwig wrote, he and the woman, then identified only as \u201cCatherine,\u201d did meet later at a cafe to talk about their estranged spouses\u2019 affair and the swirl of emotions it had stirred up in each of them.The essay was a reminder that there are two sides to every story, or perhaps four, in this case. We learn about Mr. Hertwig\u2019s pain and confusion and surprise, but what of Catherine? What had she made of being confronted by Mr. Hertwig in the therapist\u2019s office? How did the cafe meeting go, from her perspective?\u201cIt was a time when I had so many questions and so few answers,\u201d said Catherine Chaulk, reached by phone. \u201cI so desperately wanted to understand any part of it. I was just so confused.\u201dMs. Chaulk was 28 and had been married just shy of five years when she learned of her husband\u2019s infidelity. She had gone to see the therapist, she said, because she and her husband had met with the woman previously for marriage counseling. Ms. Chaulk wanted to get answers from someone who knew and understood her situation. It turned out that person was not the therapist, but Mr. Hertwig.Indeed, one ponders the mysterious ways of chance and fate after learning that Ms. Chaulk visited the therapist just once (after couples counseling). Meeting Mr. Hertwig that day in the waiting room was \u201ca total fluke\u201d and \u201csurreal,\u201d she said.She found talking with the husband of the woman that her husband was having an affair with more therapeutic than any therapy session.For one thing, she was able, through Mr. Hertwig, to \u201cpiece together some of the timeline,\u201d she said, to better know what had happened by comparing their spouses\u2019 behavior and schedules over the previous months. \u201cI\u2019ll never get the full story,\u201d she said. \u201cBut having some sense helped me find some closure and move on.\u201dIt also helped that Mr. Hertwig knew exactly what she was going through because he was going through it, too. \u201cWith some of my friends, they were so angry on my behalf and I didn\u2019t want the anger,\u201d Ms. Chaulk said. \u201cWhereas Benjamin and I could express a wide spectrum of feelings. It was a safe place to do it, and more productive.\u201dMr. Hertwig, looking back on the encounter four years later, had a similar assessment of his conversations with Ms. Chaulk, who had \u201cexperienced the flip side of the coin,\u201d he said. Being able to talk to her likewise for him made the therapist largely unnecessary. What was more helpful, he said, was \u201cthe feeling of looking across at someone who had experienced much of what I experienced and felt what I had felt.\u201dMr. Hertwig is a former soldier who had served in Afghanistan, a difficult experience he was struggling with. In his essay, he said he was \u201cattracted to her strength \u2014 maybe to her as well.\u201d How did Ms. Chaulk feel in that moment?For so long in her relationship with her husband, she said, \u201cI\u2019d been lying to my friends and everyone, pretending all was well when it wasn\u2019t. During that time in the cafe, I was willing to look it in the eye and embrace it and make a plan. That was the first time I was honest with myself and how I was feeling.\u201dIf she felt a similar romantic spark toward Mr. Hertwig, it was because they were communicating honestly, she said, \u201cand because we so clearly were on the same page. We had some very similar values. Being able to share that with someone was intimate in its own way.\u201dThese days, Ms. Chaulk is a nurse in the same Canadian city where the story takes place. She is divorced from her husband, with whom she shares custody of their son, and is currently in a long-term relationship.Every now and then, she said, she dusts off Mr. Hertwig\u2019s essay. \u201cRereading it puts me back in a place where I was the most honest I\u2019ve been with myself,\u201d Ms. Chaulk said. \u201cI use that story as a checkpoint so that I maintain that.\u201dMr. Hertwig is no longer in contact with his ex-wife. He has been dating the same woman for several years, and he also communicates with Ms. Chaulk every so often through Facebook. Despite their brief interaction, and the unhappy circumstances under which it took place, Mr. Hertwig said he will always feel \u201clinked\u201d to her, even as the years pass.\u201cBecause however brief, it was important to me,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The South will rise again!\u201d The ad, created in October of 2016, cost approximately $1,300 and garnered roughly 40,000 clicks.Representatives also noted that some ads, including one from the account \u201cTEN_GOP,\u201d were shared by members of the Trump campaign and administration, including Kelly Anne Conway, Michael Flynn and President Trump\u2019s son, Donald J. Trump Jr.\u201cWhether knowingly or unknowingly, they helped legitimize and spread Russian disinformation,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut.One ad from a Facebook account called \u201cBack the Badge\u201d saw more than 1.3 million impressions and more than 73,000 likes.The timing and content of the ads were no accident. Last year, as the Black Lives Matter protest movement gained steam, the Internet Research Agency in Russia created groups that supported the movement \u2014 like the far-reaching account \u201cBlacktivists\u201d \u2014 and opposed to it, like \u201cBack the Badge.\u201d That suggested a surgical deployment of incendiary content across all three platforms with the aim of dividing Americans at critical moments in the election season.\u201cIt was undertaken by people who understand social media,\u201d Facebook\u2019s general counsel, Colin Stretch said, referring to the Russian agencies who created the accounts. \u201cThese people were not amateurs.\u201dLawmakers used a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee to stake partisan positions on the legitimacy of the 2016 presidential campaign, either defending President Trump\u2019s election or asserting that his narrow victory could have been delivered by Russian efforts on social media.Republicans strongly pushed back on the idea that Facebook, Google, and Twitter were responsible for the election results.\u201cA lot of folks, including many in the media, have tried to reduce this entire conversation down to one premise: foreign actors conducted a surgically executed covert operation to help elect a United States president,\u201d said Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the committee. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, emphasized that the real intent of Russian propaganda was to generally spread misinformation and chaos.\u201cThese operations, they\u2019re not limited to 2016 and not limited to the presidential race, and they continue to this day. They are much more widespread than one election,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.Democrats, however, trained their remarks on the direct connection between Russian activity and the election.\u201cThe Russians created Facebook pages, posted YouTube videos, all trying to appeal to specific audiences,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat from Oregon, said.The partisan dynamics put the social media companies in a difficult position, and Facebook wouldn\u2019t take a side.\u201cWe\u2019ve provided all the information we can about the content that we\u2019ve identified on the system,\u201d said Mr. Stretch, suggesting that the committee assess \u201call of the online and offline activity that would be necessary to effectuate a campaign.\u201dSenator Martin Heinrich, Democrat from New Mexico, aimed at Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissal of the role of social media in his win.\u201cLast month President Trump called Russian purchased Facebook ads a hoax. I\u2019ve looked at those Russian sponsored Facebook ads. I certainly hope you\u2019ve had a chance to review them. Are they, in fact, a hoax?\u201d Mr. Heinrich said.\u201cNo. The existence of those ads were on Facebook, and it was not a hoax,\u201d Mr. Stretch saidRepresentative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, got to the heart of the Facebook and Twitter\u2019s dilemma: its business models are built on generating viral content.\u201cPart of what made the Russia social media campaign successful is that they understood algorithms you use that tend to accentuate content that is either fear-based or anger-based,\u201d said Mr. Schiff, who then asked the companies what their \u201csocietal obligation\u201d is to change those dynamics.The companies pushed back on the idea that their algorithms only reward viral content, which would make the sites vulnerable to the most outrageous posts.\u201cYes we do have an obligation to prevent foreign interference in the election. We take that obligation seriously,\u201d Mr. Stretch of Facebook said. \u201cWith respect to the algorithm, our goal is to provide the most relevant information. It\u2019s primarily driven by friends and family. That\u2019s the core of Facebook.\u201dSenator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has largely spearheaded the effort prodding Facebook into handing over data, immediately went after the social media giant in his questioning.In a seven-minute exchange, most of Mr. Warner\u2019s time was spent dressing down Mr. Stretch for what he characterized as a lack of responsiveness from Facebook as his office repeatedly asked for more data on the extent to which Russian meddling influenced the election.\u201cI have more than a little bit of frustration that many of us on this committee have been raising this issue since the beginning of this year, and our claims were frankly blown off by the leadership of your companies,\u201d Mr. Warner said.Mr. Warner hammered his point with blown-up prints of some of the Facebook posts that circulated. One featured an illustration of Hillary Clinton in a fistfight with a picture of Jesus, an inflammatory ad aimed at riling up conservative Americans.Several senators trained their attacks on Facebook on Wednesday for its inadvertent role in the Russian influence campaign, a repeat of Tuesday\u2019s Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing.\u201cI must say, I don\u2019t think you get it,\u201d said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who was also at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cI went home last night disappointed. I asked specific questions, I got vague answers.\u201dAs senators pressed Facebook\u2019s general counsel on Facebook\u2019s role in the election, one of the hallmarks of Facebook\u2019s explanation has been the issue of \u201cauthentic accounts.\u201dSince Facebook went public with its findings, the company\u2019s reasoning for taking down more than 80,000 fake, Russian-linked ads, was not the type of content they posted, but because those responsible for them had misrepresented who they were when creating the accounts.That distinction is key for Facebook. Outside of some parameters like nudity or incitement to violence, executives at the company are wary of becoming the arbiters of what content is or is not allowed on Facebook, fearing accusations of censorship.\u201cWe don\u2019t take for granted that each one of you uses Facebook to connect with your constituents, and that the people you represent expect authentic experiences when they come to our platform to share,\u201d Mr. Stretch said in his opening remarks on Tuesday.Mr. Burr asked if Facebook would have shut down the 470 Russian-linked accounts if they weren\u2019t fake.\u201cDoes it trouble you it took this committee to look at the authentic nature of the users and the content?\u201d Mr. Burr asked Facebook\u2019s general counsel.Mr. Stretch didn\u2019t directly answer. \u201cThe authenticity issue is the key,\u201d Mr. Stretch said, noting that many of those accounts would have been shut down anyway because they violated other terms of service.Political ads are just part of the problem, Mr. Warner said at Wednesday\u2019s first hearing.Russian agents spread nonpaid content through the creation of pages on Facebook dedicated to hot-button issues like race. On Twitter, the Kremlin-connected internet Research Agency used automatic messaging tools known as bots that could quickly spread tweets through multiple accounts.\u201cFor Facebook, much of the attention has been focused on the paid ads Russian trolls targeted to Americans. However, these ads are just the tip of a very large iceberg,\u201d Mr. Warner said. \u201cThe real story is the amount of misinformation and divisive content that was pushed for free on Russian-backed pages, which then spread widely on the news feeds of tens of millions of Americans.\u201dEarlier this week, Twitter, Facebook and Google revealed new information and numbers showing that foreign interference on their site was worse than they first reported. But the companies all stressed that the amount of Russian propaganda that reached users was just a sliver of the total amount of content their platforms produce every day.But some lawmakers think the companies are holding back information.Twitter said it identified 2,752 accounts controlled by Russian operatives and more than 36,000 \u201cbots\u201d that tweeted 1.4 million times during the election. The company had previously told lawmakers it found only 201 accounts linked to Russia.The new numbers still seem low, according to Mr. Warner.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that Twitter seems to be vastly underestimating the number of fake accounts and bots pushing disinformation. Independent researchers have estimated that up to 15 percent of Twitter accounts \u2013 or potentially 48 million accounts \u2013 are fake or automated,\u201d Mr. Warner said in his opening statement.Mr. Burr also noted the slow reaction by internet companies.With Facebook\u2019s acknowledgment that 126 million people were exposed to Russia-linked content instead of the 10 million people they originally estimated, \u201ctells me that your companies are just beginning to come grips with the scale and the depth of the problem,\u201d Mr. Burr said.\u201cYour actions need to catch up to your responsibilities,\u201d he added.For a second straight day, Ms. Feinstein asked Google why it continues to allow RT to continue to publish videos on YouTube even though a report from the American intelligence community has described RT, formerly known as Russia Today, as the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cprincipal international propaganda outlet.\u201dKent Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, walked a fine line, saying that RT\u2019s influence goes beyond merely YouTube; he noted that RT is available on cable and satellite television packages. It advertises in newspapers and can be found on hotel television channels.Google has reviewed RT\u2019s content and found that no violations to YouTube\u2019s community guidelines, Mr. Walker said. He said that the company provides information about the \u201cgovernment-funded nature\u201d of RT on Google \u2014 presumably on search results \u2014 and said it is considering expanding that to YouTube. He didn\u2019t elaborate how Google plans to do so.On Tuesday in a separate hearing, Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s director of law enforcement and information security, said Google dropped RT from its top advertising tier because of \u201ca drop in viewership\u201d \u2014 not because of its content.Ms. Feinstein said Google\u2019s answers were unsatisfactory. She repeated an earlier admonition of the tech companies: \u201cWe\u2019re in a different day now.\u201d\u2014 Daisuke WakabayashiDespite being located in the San Francisco Bay Area, all of three tech companies position themselves as \u201cglobal platforms.\u201d The internet, as Mr. Stretch noted on Tuesday, is borderless.But the distinction presents a number of problems for the companies, particularly on foreign interference in American elections. Are technology companies beholden to protecting the interests of the nations they reside in? Or do they answer to some higher authority?Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, noted that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks continue to use Twitter and other digital outlets to publish document dumps and email leaks, some of which are damaging to Americans.\u201cIs it biased to side with America against our adversaries?\u201d Mr. Cotton asked, painting Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks as anti-American.Twitter\u2019s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, demurred. \u201cWe try to be unbiased across the world.\u201dRecently, Twitter broke ranks with Google and Facebook in its treatment of Russia Today and Sputnik, state-backed media agencies in Russia. Twitter banned RT and Sputnik from advertising on its platform and donated the funds to external research into how Twitter is used for civic engagement and elections. Facebook and the Google-owned YouTube have not taken the same route, citing that RT and Sputnik have not broken their terms of service agreements.But Twitter\u2019s move puts the company in a difficult position: What if Russia, for example, claims that an American news network is a state-backed propaganda arm in America, and demands that such a network be banned from advertising as well?Top executives for the three companies appeared before a judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday armed with regrets and pledges to do better. The lawmakers appeared to be unimpressed.Facebook came under particularly heavy fire, as senators from both parties pressed the companies on their sluggish responses.\u201cWhy has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem, see it clearly for the problem it is, and begin to work in a responsible way to address it?\u201d Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, asked in one pointed exchange.The senators also raised doubts that efforts outlined by the companies \u2014 Facebook, for instance, said that it would hire more than 1,000 people to review political ad purchases \u2014 would protect the United States from outside influence.\u201cI\u2019m trying to get us down from La-La Land here,\u201d said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. \u201cThe truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month. Every minute. Probably every second. You don\u2019t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?\u201dSenator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, pushed the executives to weigh in on legislation that would require the companies to report who funds political ads online. In response, they suggested voluntary efforts already underway but said they hoped to work with lawmakers on such requirements.The House intelligence committee is expected on Wednesday to publicly release much-anticipated copies of Facebook ads purchased by Russian-linked accounts.Wednesday will be a particularly busy day for Facebook, which will also report its third-quarter earnings at 4 p.m. Eastern, around the middle of the day\u2019s second hearing.The company, which is used by more than 2 billion people worldwide, is expected to post stellar results, with revenues from advertising jumping 41 percent from the same quarter last year to $9.88 billion.With its stock trading at a record high and the company\u2019s market capitalization over $500 billion \u2014 more than the gross domestic product of countries like Columbia and Taiwan \u2014 Facebook\u2019s business success clashes with the posture it will present to lawmakers.To members of Congress, Facebook will be contrite and stress the challenges of fixing its technology to prevent abuse of its site by foreign governments. But to investors, the message this afternoon will be decidedly bullish.That contradiction is at the heart of the problem Facebook is confronting. Its business model, all based on advertising, is largely automated and reward the most viral content, even at the sake of the public interest.According to testimony by the companies, Russian agents spread inflammatory posts that reached 126 million Facebook users, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded more than 1,000 videos to Google\u2019s YouTube service.The latest disclosure will most likely serve to underline complaints among lawmakers that the tech giants have been slow to recognize and react to the significance of the Russian campaign.On Wednesday, Mr. Warner and others are likely to bore into the details of the companies\u2019 internal investigations, questioning their rigor, as well remedies the companies have already volunteered.They will also want to hear about solutions to issues beyond the disclosure of paid political advertising, like the influence of bots and \u201corganic posts\u201d harnessed by foreign powers.\u201cTransparency in advertising alone, however, is not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages,\u201d Mr. Schiff said recently.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pope Francis Arrives in a Myanmar Tarnished by Rohingya Crackdown", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYANGON, Myanmar \u2014 Pope Francis landed in Myanmar, and in a diplomatic minefield, on Monday.In Myanmar, the pope will seek to strike a careful balance by maintaining his moral authority without endangering his tiny local flock.Despite the criticisms of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the pope\u2019s allies have urged him to lend her his support \u2014 and, they hope, political strength \u2014 as the country\u2019s best chance to prevent a backslide into absolute rule by the military.The Constitution, written by the military, puts the armed forces out of her control. And the military has enough support in Parliament to prevent any changes that could loosen the grip on power held by General Min Aung Hlaing, who has ambitions to run the country.So for Francis, his first meeting here with the general, which was added at the last minute, might well be the more important one.\u201cIt\u2019s smart to meet the commander in chief first because he is very important and the principal person to solve this challenge facing our country,\u201d said Dr. Yan Myo Thein, a political analyst in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s main city.According to the Vatican, the meeting with the general and top commanders from the Bureau of Special Operations lasted about 15 minutes and was a \u201ccourtesy visit\u201d at the residence of the local archbishop, where Francis is staying.Greg Burke, the Vatican spokesman who is traveling with the pope, said they had discussed \u201cthe great responsibility of the country\u2019s authorities in this moment of transition.\u201dA statement on the general\u2019s Facebook page paraphrased him as telling the pope that soldiers sought to build a stable and peaceful country and \u201cthere\u2019s no religious discrimination in Myanmar and there\u2019s the freedom of religion.\u201dThe pope then gave the general a medallion commemorating his visit. The general gave the pope an ornate rice bowl and a harp in the shape of a boat.The timing of the meeting suggested that the pope was mindful of the egos and agendas that he must navigate without making a misstep that could endanger Myanmar\u2019s 700,000 Catholics, who make up about 1.3 percent of the population.If the gravity of the task weighed on him, he did not show it on the flight from Rome.On the plane, Francis seemed in good spirits, apologizing beforehand for the scorching temperatures in Myanmar and announcing, \u201cNow I will salute you.\u201d He also walked through the cabin, gamely signing books and accepting the trinkets of reporters.As he left Yangon Airport in a Toyota Mark II Grande sedan, Francis rolled down a window to wave at hundreds more children cheering \u201cViva, Papa\u201d next to curious backpackers and wary security officials. The surrounding streets were lined with young people in white T-shirts and yellow hats with the trip\u2019s official emblem, a heart under the motto \u201cMissionary of Love and Peace.\u201d Some waved Vatican flags and had its yellow-and-white colors painted on their cheeks.Those crowds thinned, though signs on lampposts extended \u201cA Heartiest Welcome to the Holy Father Pope Francis, Missionary of Love and Peace.\u201dCopies of the Vatican\u2019s newspaper, L\u2019Osservatore Romano, which were made available on the plane, featured a front-page interview with Cardinal Bo in which the prelate said that the pope \u201cwill arrive in a moment in which the country is in the news because of the migration of thousands of people.\u201d\u201cThere is great hope that his presence will succeed in melting the heart of everyone and push the country towards a lasting peace,\u201d the cardinal said in the interview.The semantic flexibility \u2014 saying migration instead of ethnic cleansing, Muslims of Rakhine State instead of Rohingya \u2014 has introduced a degree of diplomatic absurdity to the visit, especially for a pontiff who has a reputation for speaking his mind.In a certain sense, the trip may be a needless headache for Francis.As the onetime darling of the humanitarian community and democracy activists, she was already starting to come under criticism at that time for the poor treatment of the Rohingya. The situation has since deteriorated, and her reputation has sunk as she has failed to confront a military crackdown on the Rohingya \u2014 or \u201cthose who have crossed over to Bangladesh,\u201d as she has called them.But the church\u2019s leaders in Myanmar, especially Cardinal Bo, whom Francis elevated in 2015, have argued that the pope must invest in Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, as she is perhaps the country\u2019s last, and best, chance to proceed on a road to democracy and the protection of civil rights.Francis is scheduled to fly to the capital, Naypyidaw, to meet her on Tuesday.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described a present given to Pope Francis in Myanmar. It was a harp in the shape of a boat, not in the shape of a goat.An earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to Pope Francis\u2019s trip to Myanmar. The trip to Myanmar was not his first papal visit to a majority-Buddhist nation; Francis visited Sri Lanka in 2015.Saw Nang contributed reporting from Mandalay, Myanmar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "WeWork Buys Meetup, the Service for Bringing Hobbyists Together", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWeWork has made its name \u2014 and collected billions of dollars from investors \u2014 by providing places for people to work. Now, it is buying a social network meant to bring people together in their off time.WeWork announced on Tuesday that it had bought Meetup, whose 35 million members use the service to find fellow aficionados of some common interest: drone racing, say, or learning Dutch.Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\u201cIt\u2019s like a magical puzzle that fits together,\u201d said Scott Heiferman, the chief executive and a co-founder of Meetup.Meetup members organize on average about 15,000 gatherings a day, according to the company.The event-organizing service has at least broken even over the last few years and has not taken in outside money in years, Mr. Heiferman said. But the company believed that to grow \u2014 and especially to do so abroad \u2014 it needed to bring in investors again.The process of raising money eventually led to conversations about selling Meetup altogether. The company\u2019s general counsel, David Pashman, had a relationship with a senior WeWork executive and suggested the two businesses talk.In August, Mr. Heiferman met with WeWork\u2019s chief executive, Adam Neumann, and the two quickly came to believe that uniting the two companies made sense. WeWork\u2019s roughly 10 million square feet of leased office space, spread out over more than 170 locations in 16 countries, is used primarily during the day. By contrast, meetups happen primarily outside of working hours.WeWork could especially help in promoting Meetup abroad, given its growing overseas presence.Already, roughly 100,000 people have attended a Meetup gathering at a WeWork location, according to the companies.\u201cYou need a proper community space for that,\u201d Mr. Heiferman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a musty church basement or whatever space people used in the old days.\u201dBut Shiva Rajaraman, WeWork\u2019s chief product officer, said that the deal had been done for a bigger reason: to help instill a sense of broader community in the company\u2019s spaces.\u201cIt\u2019s less about utilization and much more about that fundamental mission of connecting people to their purpose,\u201d Mr. Rajaraman said. \u201cThis is a great tool to introduce people to their passions.\u201dMeetup will continue to operate as it has, Mr. Heiferman said. He added that the ideal operating model would be something like how Instagram functions within Facebook, or Zappos within Amazon. (Zappos\u2019s chief executive, Tony Hsieh, is on Meetup\u2019s board.)\u201cWe\u2019re going to be a core part of WeWork,\u201d Mr. Heiferman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really great culture that we\u2019re proud to be a part of.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You know that little blue badge that some people have on Twitter, signifying that they have been \u201cverified\u201d to be who they say they are? Well, Twitter thinks it needs an overhaul.The badge had become something of a status symbol. But then people started pointing out that avowed white supremacists had become verified, and people argued that Twitter was giving a tacit seal of approval to racist speech or the people behind it.The company says it is also rethinking how verification should work in the future. I always thought being verified was sort of silly, even though I admit I have a little blue badge as well. It seems like the whole program really isn\u2019t worth the headache to me.For Twitter, though, I have to imagine that part of the problem comes from how unevenly it applied those blue badges. You are a New York Times reporter with a badge; I am one without.

He went to say that things are changing, and that starts with more transparency around the company\u2019s rules and terms of service.\u201cWe\u2019re working to be more transparent. I wouldn\u2019t give us a high grade at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to learn as quickly as possible.\u201d\u2014 Mike IsaacHoward Schultz, the executive chairman of Starbucks, lashed out at the proposed tax code overhauls being promoted by Republicans.\u201cWhen so many people are living paycheck to paycheck, corporate America does not need a tax cut,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not tax reform. This is a tax cut. This is fool\u2019s gold.\u201dInstead, Mr. Schultz said the government should focus on investing in initiatives like education and better health care.\u2014 David GellesLaurene Powell Jobs, the founder of Emerson Collective and the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, is emerging as a potent force in philanthropy.On education.Ms. Powell Jobs said the sorry state of public education had motivated her to pursue a number of initiatives aimed at improving opportunities for students and giving them more resources. \u201cAt most, 50 percent of students who are graduating high school prepared for college or a career,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not even close to where we need to be.\u201dOn immigration.Ms. Powell Jobs discussed the issue with President Trump earlier this year and took out advertisements supporting the Dream Act, legislation intended to shield young immigrants who brought here illegally from deportation. \u201cWe believe strongly that congress needs to pass the Dream Act or something akin to it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to put some pressure on people who have to take this vote.\u201d\u2014 David GellesAmerica needs manufacturing, said Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s chief executive.And for Mr. Krzanich, who was on the president\u2019s manufacturing advisory council before it disbanded in August, keeping manufacturing in America is about more than jobs. Without it, the nation risks losing its edge on research and development, too.\u201cR. & D. and manufacturing are often tied together and if we lose manufacturing I think we really risk losing R. & D. next,\u201d he said.\u2014 Niraj ChokshiMaybe, said Mark Cuban.Mr. Cuban said that he was \u201cconsidering\u201d a presidential run, repeating an assertion he has made before.\u201cPeople are looking for an independent voice, a real independent voice, that at least has an inkling of what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said. But he added \u201cI\u2019ve had three kids. What caring, loving parent would put an 8-, an 11- and a 14-year-old child through this?\u201dMr. Cuban also offered thoughts on how he might approach tax regulation.The corporate tax rate should be lower, somewhere around 25 percent, but not too low, Mr. Cuban said. There are so many incentives to do business in America that there\u2019s no reason to excessively cut rates.\u2014 Niraj ChokshiOver the past several years, business has become inextricably linked with policy \u2014 in Washington, in Brussels, in Beijing \u2014 like never before.

{"Headline": "Myanmar General\u2019s Purge of Rohingya Lifts His Popular Support", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYANGON, Myanmar \u2014 The most powerful person in Myanmar now, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, was little known outside the country\u2019s military circles until the villages started burning.Within just a few weeks in 2009, his forces drove tens of thousands of people out of two ethnic enclaves in eastern Myanmar \u2014 first the Shan, near the Thai border, then the Kokang, closer to China. Locals accused his soldiers of murder, rape and systematic arson.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who is the country\u2019s de facto civilian leader, has been harshly criticized for allowing the Rohingya\u2019s expulsion. But under the Constitution, which was written by the military, she has no authority over the armed forces.That is solely the province of General Min Aung Hlaing, 61.\u201cThey are pinching themselves,\u201d David Scott Mathieson, an analyst in Yangon, said about the military leadership. \u201cThey hit the jackpot. They are six years into the democracy era, and they are more popular than in decades.\u201dGeneral Min Aung Hlaing has effectively sidelined Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose electoral landslide in 2015 blocked a potential path for him to become president of Myanmar, also known as Burma. She is barred in the Constitution from becoming president and heads the government under the title she created, \u201cstate counselor.\u201dShe and the general rarely meet or speak to each other. And as his military offensive continues, it is deeply undermining Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s international standing.\u201cAung San Suu Kyi and her government are a human shield for the military against international and domestic criticism,\u201d said Mark Farmaner, director of the London-based Burma Campaign U.K.General Min Aung Hlaing\u2019s power includes appointing three key cabinet members, overseeing the police and border guards, and presiding over two large business conglomerates. He fills a quarter of Parliament\u2019s seats, enough to block any constitutional amendment that would limit his authority.The general makes occasional public appearances and often posts on social media about his high-level meetings. Mostly, though, he asserts his power quietly from behind closed doors. People who know him are reluctant to talk publicly about his character or their conversations. He declined to speak to The New York Times.Interviews with more than 30 people, including current and former military officers, rights activists, analysts, diplomats and legal experts, paint a portrait of a thoughtful strategist who has used his power to promote a starkly nationalist agenda.Now, many expect he will try in coming elections to again put a general in the presidency: himself.\u201cHis plan is to become president in 2020,\u201d said U Win Htein, an adviser to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and a leader in her party, the National League for Democracy.Min Aung Hlaing grew up in central Rangoon, now Yangon, where his father was a construction ministry official.After high school, the future general studied law. But his dream was to attend the Defense Services Academy, the surest route to success for a young man during a half-century of military rule. He passed the entrance exam on his third try, said his childhood friend, U Hla Oo, a writer who lives in Australia.The future general was known for his smile, but his tendency to criticize and blame others won him few friends. His contemporaries gave him a nickname meaning cat feces, an especially vulgar epithet in Burmese, said three former military members, including Mr. Win Htein.One fellow cadet recalled in a 2011 radio interview that the young Min Aung Hlaing liked to bully the newer students.\u201cWe were so afraid of him,\u201d recalled U Aung Lynn Htut, who became an intelligence officer and diplomat before defecting to the United States. \u201cWhenever we walked by in front of him, he always loved to find fault. So we always tried our best to keep away from him.\u201d\u201cBurning villages is what they have done for years,\u201d Mr. Mathieson said. \u201cHe would have risen in the ranks in the \u201980s when this was happening all the time.\u201dOne of his commanding officers, Mr. Hla Oo said, was a colonel named Than Shwe, who later became senior general and head of the ruling clique.In early 2009, Min Aung Hlaing was named chief of the Bureau of Special Operations-2, overseeing northeastern Myanmar. In July and August that year, his troops targeted rebels in Shan State campaigns that drove nearly 50,000 people from their homes.In March 2011, Senior Gen. Than Shwe bypassed older and more experienced generals and picked Min Aung Hlaing, then a young lieutenant general, as commander-in-chief.His selection was part of the junta leader\u2019s plan to restructure the government under the new Constitution. Then in his mid-70s, Than Shwe needed a trusted successor who would not hold him accountable in retirement for his brutal reign or his accumulation of personal wealth.Than Shwe put two other top generals into civilian positions, including Thein Sein as president, and dissolved the junta in 2011.In 2013, Min Aung Hlaing took on the title of senior general previously held by his mentor. It is unclear who promoted him.Min Aung Hlaing was in line to succeed Thein Sein in the presidency, but that plan was foiled by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s overwhelming victory in 2015.After the election, he decided to stay on past the mandatory retirement age of 60 for five more years, despite complaints that the move was improper.As commander-in-chief, he has acted much like a head of state, traveling to meet foreign leaders and arms suppliers, and holding court in Naypyidaw, the capital, with ambassadors and visiting dignitaries.\u201cHe pays attention to detail,\u201d said U Min Zin, executive director of the Institute for Strategy and Policy Myanmar, an independent center in Yangon that promotes democracy. \u201cHe is good at delegating; he presents himself as a statesman.\u201dThe military\u2019s edge in Myanmar is not an accident. The generals spent more than 15 years drafting their Constitution, instituting a byzantine government structure with many built-in powers for the commander-in-chief.Since Parliament selects the president, the commander-in-chief\u2019s control of a quarter of the seats gives him a big head start in any future contest.He has extensive authority over local civilian affairs through his control of the Ministry of Home Affairs and its General Administration Department. \u201cThat means day-to-day administration of the country is under the military,\u201d said U Yan Myo Thein, an independent analyst in Yangon.The general also oversees an extensive intelligence apparatus, unlike Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who at times seems poorly informed about events in the country.And the military owns two of Myanmar\u2019s largest conglomerates, the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited and Myanmar Economic Corporation.Those secretive companies operate in many sectors, including jade mining, energy, banking, insurance, telecommunications, transportation, tourism and information technology, analysts say.Historically, they have been an important source of wealth for the generals, said U Ye Myo Hein, executive director of the Tagaung Institute of Political Studies, an independent policy center in Yangon.\u201cThey have a vast economic empire,\u201d he said. \u201cHe does not have to answer to Parliament or the civilian government. We have a long history of the business-military complex. It is very difficult to stop that.\u201dMost land in Myanmar is owned by the government, and the generals have a history of seizing desirable properties and handing them to favored companies, including their own. The commander-in-chief also has authority over many land-use decisions through the Ministry of Home Affairs.\u201cHe controls everything that has to do with the land,\u201d said U Myint Thwin, a lawyer who represents farmers trying to recover 20,000 acres outside Yangon that the military seized two decades ago. Twenty farmers were jailed for months in 2014 after they filed a lawsuit seeking the land\u2019s return.He said he and the farmers sent letters last year to General Min Aung Hlaing asking him to give back the land.\u201cThe military people were calling the farmers and threatening them.\u201d he said. \u201cThe military sent me a letter saying, \u2018If you don\u2019t withdraw the letter, we will sue you for defamation.\u2019 \u201dSome activists fear that the general will declare the abandoned Rohingya villages vacant and give the property to other ethnic groups, making it harder for the refugees to return.In September, the general visited Maungdaw, a town in northern Rakhine State on the border with Bangladesh, and lamented in a speech that the Rohingya had been more successful in business than other ethnic groups.He urged non-Rohingya who had fled the violence to return home and rebuild their communities.Saw Nang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snapchat Remakes Itself, Splitting the Social From the Media", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Wednesday, its parent company, Snap, continued that unconventional approach, unveiling a redesign that effectively separates social and media into two parts of the Snapchat app.Where users of Facebook see one giant news feed of information, typically determined by what they have liked and what their friends post, Snapchat users will now see a left side of the app that includes chats and stories shared with, or by, their friends. That\u2019s the social part. On the right side, there will be content from publishers, amateur creators, celebrities and stories that Snap curates from user-generated videos and photos. That\u2019s the media part.\u201cWhile blurring the lines between professional content creators and your friends has been an interesting internet experiment, it has also produced some strange side effects (like fake news) and made us feel like we have to perform for our friends rather than just express ourselves,\u201d Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, said in a blog post about the redesign, which is to begin rolling out on Wednesday and continue through the end of the week.Snap\u2019s stock has fallen below its initial public offering price, and the company remains unprofitable. Snap delivered a disappointing earnings report this month, causing its stock to plunge even further. .Some things about Snapchat are not changing. For instance, the app still opens to the phone camera, allowing users to make and share photos and videos.But the redesign otherwise moves Snapchat even further away from a traditional social media model.Material shown on the app\u2019s right side \u2014 what is now the media part \u2014 must meet content and community standards, Snap has decided, whether that material is produced by a newspaper, a television studio, the company\u2019s in-house news and stories teams or so-called influencers. All must be vetted and approved.\u201cSeparating social from media has allowed us to build the best way to communicate with friends and the best way to watch great content \u2014 while addressing many of the problems that plague the internet today,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.Philip Napoli, a professor of public policy at Duke who studies media and democracy, said that Snapchat\u2019s redesign would test people\u2019s willingness to embrace a social media app that relied more on human curators than algorithms.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there\u2019s enough of a consumer backlash to make this potentially viable, especially in light of the last year,\u201d Professor Napoli said.Snap said it was using a kind of artificial intelligence known as machine learning to understand what people like to see, based on their activity, and planned to offer them new content in line with those preferences.There are limits to the amount of personalization that Snapchat will provide. In an approach similar to how Netflix widely promotes some television shows and movies, Snap will continue to promote some material \u2014 including breaking news, a new video series or a popular sporting event \u2014 to all of its users.Human curators will also program content to make sure that users\u2019 preferences are not keeping them from seeing a wide array of opinions and ideas, the company said. In addition to winnowing out fake news, this may keep Snapchat from becoming a place that reinforces narrow sets of thinking.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Bronx Takeout Spot Honors the Memory of a Mother", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City11 PhotosThe alcapurrias at Margarita\u2019s, in Longwood in the South Bronx, are as dark as caramel stopped just short of burning, and too hot to touch. Let them rest a minute.The fritters\u2019 dough \u2014 of green bananas and plantains, mashed and tinged red-orange from achiote \u2014 has a crust as thin as skin, with crunch immediately giving way to sinking in. The textures keep changing: chewy, then airy at the center, where you might find jueyes, freshwater crab meat still juicy and roused by sofrito, or ground beef with a streak of saz\u00f3n, the warming Latin spice blend.The chef, Margarita Brito, has been making alcapurrias all her life. She came to New York at age 16 from the Dominican Republic; her mother, Reyna Prospero (known by her middle name, Margarita), started a food truck five years later, in 1992, with Ms. Brito at the stove. They called the truck Mama Isabel\u2019s Place, after Ms. Brito\u2019s grandmother back in Santo Domingo, and stationed it on an empty chain-linked lot across the street from P.S. 130 in the Bronx, where Ms. Prospero\u2019s youngest children went to school.Then, on Nov. 12, 2001, Ms. Prospero boarded American Airlines Flight 587 with her 9-year-old son, Wilberto Brito, for a visit home to Santo Domingo. It was a flight so often taken by Dominican immigrants that the merengue star Kinito M\u00e9ndez memorialized it in \u201cEl Avi\u00f3n,\u201d his late-\u201990s hit with Johnny Ventura. But on that autumn morning, shortly after takeoff from Kennedy International Airport, the plane fell from the sky, killing all 260 passengers and crew on board and five people on the ground, in one of the deadliest crashes in American history.After mourning, Ms. Brito soldiered on with the help of her husband, Rafael Medina, selling alcapurrias and pastelillos from the same truck, in the same spot, every March through Thanksgiving as her mother had done. Then, two years ago, they left the truck behind and opened this small takeout joint a block and a half away on Avenue Saint John.The name, Margarita\u2019s, is as much her mother\u2019s as her own.In this predominantly Latino neighborhood, Ms. Brito\u2019s pastelillos are justly beloved. They are cousins to empanadas but flakier, with a greater debt to butter. Ms. Brito turns them into giant crescents with generous fillings and wide margins of bubbled, crispy dough, without a stain of oil. They are as buoyant and satisfying, whether packed with beef or with jueyes, camarones (shrimp) or carrucho (conch), briny and tender.The prices haven\u2019t changed from the food truck days, save for a couple of pastelillos nudged up 50 cents. And the larger kitchen has given Ms. Brito room to show off more of her formidable cooking skills. Now there is a steam table that, if you\u2019re lucky, will include great rugged alb\u00f3ndigas (meatballs) in a dark sauce of tomatoes and sofrito, and bistec, beef braised and tangled with keeled loops of onion, their sugars running.Other nights there might be res guisada, a stew of long-mellowed beef and broken-down carrots, or cocido, a soup stocked with cow feet, the collagen leaching into a broth that rests lush and heavy on the tongue. Sopa de camarones is always on the menu, fortified by shrimp stock and rice, with tamarind bringing a contour of sourness. The color is the gift of achiote, like a last gasp of sunset.Still, I might be content if Ms. Brito made nothing but carne de cerdo frita, knots of pork rubbed with garlic and oregano, sheened with lemon and fried. Each bite is a smack of salt. They come with a choice of tostones (twice-fried smashed plantains) or potatoes, and I pity those who choose potatoes: Ms. Brito\u2019s tostones are among the best in town, long cuts of rough gold, crispy on the outside and then all surrender.To those who don\u2019t live in the neighborhood, the modest storefront may look like any of the city\u2019s thousands of takeout joints, with its neon welcome sign, photographs of food in the front window, utilitarian counters and two mismatched tiny tables. But note the throngs of customers, many of them among the faithful who once lined up at the truck, who have eaten Ms. Brito\u2019s alcapurrias for more than two decades.They know. As the legend on the truck said: \u201cLe esperamos, Margarita y Familia\u201d \u2014 Margarita and her family await you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jet Pilot Might Not Seem Like a \u2018Gig,\u2019 but at Ryanair, It Is", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo contain the crisis, Ryanair might cut a week of vacation from the airline\u2019s 4,200 pilots \u2014 many of whom aren\u2019t full-time employees but independent contractors. If they \u201cmisbehaved\u201d by declining to help, he added, they would get no \u201cgoodies\u201d in the future.It wasn\u2019t the first provocative comment from Mr. O\u2019Leary, a pugnacious leader who transformed Europe\u2019s airline industry with an aggressive cost-cutting approach that extended to the work force.Employees have banded together to demand collective bargaining and more secure contracts, touching off a fresh clash with management. Last week, 59 pilots representing employees across Europe renewed those demands, adding that \u201cpilots have had enough.\u201dRyanair controls its expenses by using a mix of full-time employees and self-employed pilots recruited through outside agencies. It also issues Irish work contracts to cabin crew and senior pilots around Europe, arguing that they work in Irish-registered aircraft and not in the countries where they are based.The company\u2019s practices are also feeding employees\u2019 frustrations. In interviews, more than a dozen current and former pilots and crew members described demanding work conditions and atypical employment arrangements that made it difficult to voice complaints. Most agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, citing nondisclosure agreements in Ryanair contracts and concerns about jeopardizing their jobs.The president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association expressed support for Ryanair pilots.Ryanair has vowed not to meet with or recognize any union. Its concern is that rivals are capitalizing on the flight cancellation episode to organize Ryanair\u2019s pilots and crew members \u2014 a move that analysts say would hurt the company\u2019s advantage in low labor costs.Mr. O\u2019Leary declined requests for an interview. But in letters and public statements, he repeatedly blamed airline unions and competitors, saying they tried to \u201cdemean and disparage our collective success,\u201d a charge he has renewed in recent weeks.Brookfield handed Mr. Van Boekel, who was based in Belgium, a list of Irish accounting firms and told him to choose one, according to a 2013 lawsuit that Brookfield brought against Mr. Van Boekel when he resigned to work at another carrier. The accountants made him a shareholder and director of a Dublin-based \u201cservice company\u201d called Winged Foot Ltd. Brookfield then arranged for the company to supply Mr. Van Boekel\u2019s piloting services to Ryanair, the suit said.The labor setup is key to an elaborate cost-cutting strategy that Mr. O\u2019Leary pioneered in the mid-1990s, when the European air travel market was liberalized. Until then, big national carriers like Alitalia, Air France and Lufthansa had commanded the Continent, with a corps of unionized pilots.Mr. O\u2019Leary followed the low-cost model of Southwest Airlines in Dallas, now the world\u2019s biggest airline in terms of passengers. Southwest had minimized operating costs and lured fliers from legacy carriers by offering cheap, bare-bones flights.He honed the approach for Ryanair, putting hubs in inexpensive European locales that generated new tourism and jobs. Fuel costs were rigorously managed, and turnaround times for flights squeezed to the fastest in the industry. The company uses only Boeing jets to reduce engineering costs, and leases part of its fleet to recoup tax write-offs. And it avoided unionization, a strategy that some low-cost European rivals have copied, along with Ryanair\u2019s tactic of using contract pilots to cut costs.The chief executive of the biggest budget airline is Europe issued an impassioned plea to pilots, who are demanding more secure contracts.Ryanair is also a fast-track opportunity for young pilots and crew members to accumulate experience and jump to another airline. Those promoted to captain can earn a six-figure salary on a full-time contract.But employees were often blindsided by the labor setup once they were inside, according to the current and former Ryanair pilots and crew members.Thousands of new Ryanair pilots went through the same process as Mr. Van Boekel. Some were required to form limited liability companies in several countries with pilots they didn\u2019t know.As contractors, they didn\u2019t receive standard benefits for pensions or health insurance. Pilots and flight attendants on Ryanair\u2019s Irish contracts weren\u2019t always protected by labor laws in the countries where they worked. Ryanair said its contracts complied with labor laws in Ireland and the European Union.Pay has been another concern. Self-employed pilots and aircrew members are paid only for hours flown, but not for time spent preparing for a flight, or when they are delayed or canceled. Minimum monthly work hours were promised though not guaranteed.Contractor pilots paid their own transportation and costly hotel bills when assigned to fly from different airports. Like flight crews, they said they shelled out for uniforms, food and even drinking water on flights. Ryanair said that staff members received allowances to defray the costs of uniforms and other expenses. The company\u2019s go-to employment agencies required job seekers to pay for qualification training, starting at around \u20ac2,500 for flight attendants and about \u20ac30,000 for pilots.Pilots, in interviews, said they felt discouraged from raising workplace concerns, which could lead to being called into Dublin for tense meetings with managers. Others recounted being pressured to limit their fuel consumption and fearful of being reprimanded if they complained of fatigue. Flight attendants reported coming to work ill and scrambling to fulfill sales quotas on flights for lottery cards, perfumes and other items to avoid rebuke by managers. Ryanair said it did not limit fuel consumption and that its aircraft take off with fuel exceeding E.U. safety guidelines. The company disputed reprimanding staff for complaining of fatigue or illness.One former pilot recalled protesting after being told to pay for a costly taxi ride to another airport to fill in for a colleague. Managers suggested he could be demoted if he didn\u2019t comply. It created a culture of fear, he said.Robin Kiely, Ryanair\u2019s spokesman, said that claims of workplace pressures were \u201cfalse and invented,\u201d fomented by unions seeking to undermine Ryanair. \u201cThere is no pressure on people here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly work hard, but we work smart.\u201dMr. Kiely said employees enjoyed favorable conditions and unmatched job security. \u201cWe have 13,000 employees,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was so bad, they wouldn\u2019t be working here.\u201dRyanair employees have made various attempts to unionize. Each time, the effort has been rebuffed.James Atkinson, a pilot who flew with Ryanair for eight years, said that when he started in Rome in 2006, the company pressured crew members who tried to organize.People who participated in those organizing efforts were reassigned to other airports outside of Italy where Ryanair operates. Those who refused to relocate were fired; others eventually retracted their demands, he said.Later, Mr. Atkinson created his own website to try to organize Ryanair employees. Soon after, he said, Brookfield declined to renew his contract. \u201cI was pushing for organization and my contract was terminated,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said. Ryanair said he was dismissed for \u201cmisconduct,\u201d although it would not specify what that was. Today he is a pilot at a rapidly expanding airline in China.In 2011, Belgium-based Ryanair flight attendants on Irish contracts sued for the right to claim Belgian pay and entitlements in the nation\u2019s courts. Ryanair had claimed that disputes involving Irish contracts could be heard only in Ireland, where benefits like unemployment insurance and social security were less favorable than in Belgium.One attendant, Virginie Mauguit, who had been with the carrier for over two years, approached a local union for advice. She distributed union leaflets to crew members describing their rights under Belgian labor law. Two weeks later, Ms. Mauguit received notice that she was fired for previously missing work days, she said.\u201cPeople don\u2019t have the right to complain,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was dangerous for your job.\u201dMr. O\u2019Leary declared victory because the court didn\u2019t bar Ryanair from continuing to issue Irish contracts. But in his letter to employees, he said Ryanair might close gaps in benefits between Irish contracts and local labor laws.The autumn scheduling breakdown brought the issue to the forefront again, hitting not only morale but also the corporate suite.Staff members at Ryanair have continued to fight back, calling on Mr. O\u2019Leary to change the contractor model and improve working conditions. Growing numbers are pressing Ryanair to conduct collective bargaining and recognize a Europe-wide management committee that they organized, rather than negotiate through managers at each Ryanair site. Ryanair maintains that it will only recognize management committees at each of its bases.Pilots in London and in Madrid recently revolted against an offer for pay increases on the condition that they agree to continue negotiating with Ryanair directly. Many are now trying to spread the message more widely via WhatsApp and Facebook.\u201cPilots have said enough is enough: we like this company but we don\u2019t accept the terms and conditions any more,\u201d said Dirk Polloczek, president of the European Cockpit Association, representing more than 38,000 pilots across Europe.\u201cThey think Ryanair can be a good employer,\u201d he added. \u201cAll they have to do is have a dialogue with their pilots.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The G.O.P. Tax Bill Helps Me and That\u2019s Too Bad", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn my career, I have been a substantial beneficiary of the so-called \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole, the tax provision that provides an indefensibly lower tax rate on profits earned by private equity investors, hedge fund operators, real estate developers (presumably including President Trump) and the like.And I continue to be.But it is an outrageously unfair provision and, incredibly, in a bill being advertised as major tax reform, it survives.On Morning Joe Friday, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, Representative Mark Meadows, insisted that the provision would be added later, as the bill moves through Congress. If that\u2019s true, why wasn\u2019t it in a 429-page bill that includes many trivial provisions, like imposing a small tax on large university endowments?For his part, the next guest, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Kevin Brady, claimed that doubling the one year holding period for investments by users of the loophole would restore fairness. At least that\u2019s what Mr. Brady said. But after scouring the bill, I could find no provision that remotely resembled what he said.Even if his statement was true, it wouldn\u2019t negate much of the advantage of the carried interest provision. Private equity investors, real estate developers and even hedge fund managers typically hold their investments for well over two years. That means they would still get the benefit of paying 23.8 percent on this income while high-income Americans earning over $1 million per year would still pay 39.6 percent.Yes, the bill contains some other provisions that might impinge on private equity\u2019s freedom to make money, particularly the 30 percent limit on interest expense (as a percentage of earnings.) But the proposal allows any excess interest to be carried forward for five years and used to reduced gains on the sale of the investment. That makes it a small inconvenience for private equity and real estate guys.So it looks like I am going to continue to pay 23.8 percent on a substantial component of my seven-figure income, roughly the same rate on that portion as will be paid by someone making $90,000 per year.The Republicans have done a fantastic job in obscuring the impact of their bill on regular people \u2014 including the fact that a family of five will be worse off with the doubling of the standard deduction than they were before, when they could claim exemptions for their children.We know that the Republicans have fashioned a tax bill designed to help businesses and wealthy individuals. Smaller provisions buried deep in the bill \u2014 like the treatment of carried interest \u2014 simply provide more depressing evidence that this measure is not about helping the middle class.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chrysler Pacifica Owners Say Minivans Suddenly Shut Off", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySid Patel encountered the problem with his minivan while driving on a busy highway near San Francisco. Traveling at 70 miles an hour, the brand-new Chrysler Pacifica suddenly shut off.\u201cIt just died,\u201d Mr. Patel, a physician from Menlo Park, Calif., recalled. \u201cI had no electrical power, no power steering.\u201d As the minivan slowed to a crawl, and other cars whizzed by, he edged over to get to the shoulder on the right.\u201cA semi truck was coming, and he laid on the horn and swerved out and barely missed me,\u201d Mr. Patel said.That experience two months ago was not an isolated occurrence. Since the beginning of this year, more than 50 Pacifica owners have filed complaints with federal safety regulators about their vehicles suddenly losing power on the road. Others have described similar incidents on a chat forum devoted to the Pacifica and on Facebook.The number of complaints represents a small fraction of Pacifica owners \u2014 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has sold more than 156,000 Pacificas since the model was introduced in 2016. No crashes or injuries have been linked to the issue, and dealers who have examined affected vehicles have not been able to replicate the problem.Still, the company is facing mounting pressure to figure out if a serious safety defect is causing the stalling problem, and to respond to customers who have experienced it. Some say they are hesitant to drive their Pacificas \u2014 or have stopped \u2014 until a fix or explanation can be found.One owner, Adam Cohen, a lawyer in Leesburg, Va., said he and an advocacy group, the Center for Auto Safety, filed a petition with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Monday calling on the agency to open a formal investigation of the stalling issue in Pacificas and to order a recall.\u201cI understand you have to find the source of the problem before you can fix it, but there\u2019s still a safety issue here,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in an interview. He purchased his 2017 Pacifica last year and said it had twice shut down while his wife was driving.Fiat Chrysler says it is aware of the complaints and is looking into the matter, but has not found information pointing to a specific, widespread or consistent problem. The company \u201croutinely monitors the performance of its vehicles using information from multiple data streams,\u201d including formal complaints filed with regulators, Fiat Chrysler said in a statement.The automaker \u201cis unaware of any injuries or accidents associated with these complaints,\u201d a spokesman, Eric Mayne, said by email. He added that Chrysler takes customer concerns seriously and that there was no indication that the function of airbags or seatbelt tension was compromised.The Pacifica is designed so that its airbags remain operational even during a loss of power, he said.Both Mr. Cohen and Mr. Patel have left their Pacificas with their dealers and have declined to take the cars back until the stalling issue is cleared up. Mr. Cohen is driving a loaner vehicle. Mr. Patel, whose Pacifica had 308 miles on it when it shut down on the highway, is trying to get his dealer or Fiat Chrysler to buy back the minivan from him.Mr. Cohen said he was particularly frustrated because he had been discussing the matter with Fiat Chrysler engineers and quality officials over the last several weeks via phone and email. On Oct. 22, he wrote to the company\u2019s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, to bring the issue to his attention.\u201cThey want to put a data recorder on my Pacifica and have me take it back and drive it around,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cI told them they should drive it themselves and wait for it to happen. I don\u2019t want my family to be their test dummies. And that\u2019s where it stands. We\u2019re at a deadlock.\u201dKelly Katz, a mother of three small children in Yuma, Ariz., has also experienced the problem with her 2017 Pacifica. In May, she was creeping along in a parking lot when her minivan lost power. Like Mr. Cohen and Mr. Patel, she got a message on her instrument panel that said the vehicle had to be stopped, shifted into park and restarted.A few weeks later, it happened while her husband was at the wheel. Her dealer drove the minivan for three weeks but never experienced the problem. The dealer did replace an electronic steering-control monitor, though.She is still driving her Pacifica but it worries her. \u201cI\u2019m not O.K. with it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got three kids in car seats. As a mother, you don\u2019t want a minivan that can shut off while you\u2019re driving.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The shrimp are more disorderly, heaped in long trays, alongside floppy tubes of calamari and the occasional bin of glaring sardines.The possibilities: fried whole, or baked with a hidden hoard of tomatoes, celery, parsley, dill and cilantro tucked into a slit in the belly. Best of all: patted down with cracked wheat bran, slapped on a hot griddle until both sides are black and glittering, then thrust into water \u2014 quenched like a newly forged sword \u2014 with a swirl of cumin, lemon and crushed pepper. The bran keeps the juices from escaping, so the flesh is tender, and the near scorch leaves a trace of smoke.Shrimp may appear steamed, head-on and feelers outstretched, in a half-soup, half-sauce of collapsed tomatoes, bell peppers and onions. This is fine, but no rival to their grilled incarnation, butterflied and curling inward, speckled with char and sweating garlic, plump as if to burst.Fried calamari with frilly bronzed edges are as light and crisp as they should be, showing no shine of oil. The flare on the tongue is the paprika in Old Bay, strewn over the tentacles and rings; the earthiness comes from cumin, infiltrating the batter. For an Egyptian-style tagine \u2014 presented in a clay pot with high sides and no peaked lid \u2014 calamari and shrimp are half-grilled, then left to simmer with bell peppers and tomatoes that slowly wrinkle and cave in, giving up their juices to the cause.AbuQir, which opened two years ago, takes its name from a fishing village on the eastern outskirts of Alexandria, Egypt, overlooking the bay where Lord Nelson laid waste to Napoleon\u2019s fleet in 1798.

Here in Astoria, there is no scenery to distract, no sun throwing its knives at the waves, and time may grow heavy as you wait for your food. The space was once a butcher\u2019s shop and still seems more like a store than a restaurant. Tables are set close and covered with white paper. A handful of shells loll in a net draped from the ceiling. A cartoon shark grins from a wall.The side dishes arrive first. (Only a few are on offer; best to order them all.) I could have made a meal of eggplant alone, fried rounds of it dark with oil, under rings of blistered peppers and a lovely wreckage of garlic, then the same dish reprised with the garlic diluted by crushed tomatoes (a slight loss), and an exemplary baba ghanouj, the tahini and garlic in perfect concord.Rounding out the sides are a garden\u2019s worth of cucumbers and tomato, and rice mounded like a cake and shot through with caramelized onions. Pita is served in a stack like flapjacks, fluffy and shedding flour, from a local bakery. \u201cI used to make it,\u201d Mr. Ibrahim said (he ran a wholesale bread company for years). \u201cBut the kitchen is too small.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Pazar Food Collective in Canterbury, New South Wales", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare8 PhotosCANTERBURY, New South Wales \u2014 Sydney, it seems, has re-embraced fusion. From Japanese-Italian degustation menus to pop-ups serving vegan Mexican-Japanese food paired with natural wines, the city has accepted its role as a culinary rule-breaker and run with it, into sometimes dubious territory. But there are upsides to this madness.The restaurant is on a stretch of Canterbury Road that is home to drab office buildings and car dealerships and a smattering of chain restaurants. From a few paces away, the storefront space looks nondescript, so much so that the vibrancy of the room is somewhat breathtaking as you enter.Pazar is the amalgamation of the owner Attila Yilmaz\u2019s culinary experiences. Raised by his Turkish father, Mr. Yilmaz left a career in law enforcement in 2011 after being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He decided to fulfill a longstanding desire to learn more about Mexico\u2019s food, traveling to Los Angeles and Sonora, Mexico.When he returned to Sydney, Mr. Yilmaz opened a food truck serving Sonoran-style charcoal-grilled meats, and flour tortillas made in the traditional way with lard. In a city and country with a dearth of quality Mexican cooking, the regionally specific food Mr. Yilmaz cooked was a revelation to many. The following year, the space he used in Canterbury as a garage and prep area slowly morphed into a pop-up restaurant called La Lupita.The concept was a hit \u2014 the neighborhood loved it, the city discovered it and soon people were making the trip to Canterbury to try it. It was so popular that Mr. Yilmaz received a partnership offer from a local businessman to move the restaurant to a central Sydney location. La Lupita relocated to Circular Quay, but the business relationship did not last. Mr. Yilmaz severed ties and returned to Canterbury, where Pazar Food Collective was born in the same space that La Lupita had first found its audience.When Pazar opened, Mr. Yilmaz decided to bring his Turkish heritage into the mix. He installed a wood-burning oven specifically to cook the lamb forequarter that became the restaurant\u2019s signature dish: a heaping pile of smoky, juicy lamb meat served with tomato and herb ezme, and a pilaf made from bulgur. At $38, it is the most expensive item on the menu, and could feed a table of four.Dishes tend to lean in one direction or another \u2014 Turkish or Mexican \u2014 rather than blend the two cuisines aggressively. Chicken is rubbed in harissa, roasted and served with tahini yogurt, while roast pork belly, its skin crisped to a chicharr\u00f3n, is accompanied by chipotle salsa and a pineapple quinoa salad. There are crossovers, but they are mainly in the form of swapping Mexican elements out for similar Middle Eastern ingredients, or vice versa. Pazar\u2019s ode to elote \u2014 a bowl of shucked sweet corn shot through with lime \u2014 replaces the traditional cojita cheese with shaved manchego, and some of the dish\u2019s creaminess comes from labneh. These are flavors so adjacent they barely count as cross-cultural. There are no kofte tacos, in other words.There is, however, kofte made from red lentils rather than meat, and described on the menu as \u201ck\u00f6fte ss\u00e4m.\u201d Talk about your multicultural umlauts. The Korean word ssam here is employed to describe the method of consumption rather than any Korean flavor elements. The spicy lentil kofte, which has a weight and consistency remarkably close to its meaty counterpart, is served with lettuce leaves for wrapping, as well as pickles, herbs and chiles.At times the food becomes truly borderless. Japanese eggplants are cooked to a glorious, creamy mush under a blanket of roasted red pepper sauce, topped with garlic yogurt. The dish undoubtedly takes much of its DNA from the classic Turkish eggplant preparation imam bayildi, but it also shares kinship with Italian eggplant, and its unabashed sauciness even hints at ratatouille.If the food at Pazar has a connective thread, it is a dedication to brightness and balance, a penchant for ramping up flavors. It is fusion, in every sense of the word, but it tastes big and bold and global and delicious. Much like Sydney itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hartford Student Charged After Boasting About Contaminating Roommate\u2019s Belongings", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA student at the University of Hartford in Connecticut was charged with criminal mischief and expelled from school after boasting about having contaminated her roommate\u2019s toothbrush, face lotion and other belongings in an effort to drive her from the room.The student, Brianna Brochu, 18, was in court on Wednesday for charges that originated with an Instagram post in which she said that she had finally accomplished what had apparently been a long-held goal: ridding herself of her dorm roommate, Chennel Rowe, whom she referred to as \u201cJamaican Barbie.\u201d\u201cAfter one and a half months spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons on her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn\u2019t shine, and so much more, I can finally say goodbye to Jamaican Barbie,\u201d said the post, which has since been deleted. Ms. Brochu is white; Ms. Rowe is black.Lt. Michael Perruccio of the West Hartford Police Department said that the police began investigating the report on Oct. 18 and that Ms. Brochu turned herself in on Saturday.On Wednesday, the police department said it would be requesting that Ms. Brochu be charged with intimidation based on bigotry or bias, a felony. The university announced that she was no longer a student there.\u201cAs of this morning, Brianna Brochu is no longer a student at the University of Hartford,\u201d said the school\u2019s president, Gregory S. Woodward. \u201cShe will not be returning to the institution.\u201dShe said that the revelations, posted on Instagram as she was moving out, had helped explain why she had been sick early in the school year, suffering from extreme throat pain that eventually made it difficult to sleep or speak.Ms. Rowe said that she and Ms. Brochu had been placed together randomly and that their relationship had been tense.\u201cI moved out because I felt like I was unwanted in my own room,\u201d she said.As she was in the process of moving, Ms. Rowe said, other residents approached her about several posts Ms. Brochu had made on social media. They included pictures of bloodstains on Ms. Rowe\u2019s backpack and videos of Ms. Rowe eating, with comments suggesting that the utensils she was using had been contaminated.Ms. Brochu had already been charged by the time Ms. Rowe posted the video. But Ms. Rowe expressed frustration that it had taken so long for Ms. Brochu to be punished.She said that school authorities had told her if she spoke out about the situation, she could be removed from her campus residence. And she said that race had been a factor in the school\u2019s response, speculating that if she were white and Ms. Brochu were black, the investigation would have been more urgent.\u201cIf the race roles were reversed, I feel like this would have gone down a different route,\u201d she said.Ms. Rowe did not respond to emails requesting further comment on Wednesday.Her video catapulted her experience into the news, with the hashtag #justiceforjazzy \u2014 based on the name she uses on Facebook \u2014 being used to spread her story.\u201cThe university strictly and swiftly followed all procedural and legal processes related to this alleged event; claims to the contrary are based on misinformation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe incident has brought about accusations of racism, and I want you to know that I hear and share your anger and frustration. Acts of racism, bias, bullying, or other abusive behaviors will not be tolerated on this campus.\u201dMr. Woodward followed up on Wednesday with the statement announcing Ms. Brochu\u2019s expulsion. That statement clarified the timeline, saying that the school\u2019s public safety department became involved on Oct. 17 and that the case was turned over to the local authorities early the next day.Molly Polk, a spokeswoman for the university, said that the school had followed its standard procedures, immediately referring the case to the police. She said that Mr. Woodward had not been accusing Ms. Rowe of spreading misinformation in his initial statement, and that he was instead referencing the almost instantaneous reaction to the video among people on social media.Ms. Polk added that the residential staff had asked Ms. Rowe not to act on the matter on her own, but insisted that \u201ctheir intention was never to try to keep her quiet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Said to Have Held Talks to Acquire 21st Century Fox Assets", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Walt Disney Company recently held preliminary talks to buy entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the Fox movie and television studio, the FX cable network and a share of Hulu.The talks were first reported by CNBC on Monday and confirmed by two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private information. The two companies are no longer talking, although discussions could restart.Spokeswomen for both companies declined to comment.The talks, however preliminary, say a lot about the rapidly evolving media industry. Big players like Disney are seeking to get bigger as they follow Netflix into the streaming business and square off against technology giants like AT&T, which is in the final stages of acquiring Time Warner. Medium-size players like 21st Century Fox may be realizing \u2014 or accepting \u2014 that gaining the scale they need to compete may be out of reach at this point.Disney shares climbed 2 percent on Monday. Disney is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.Fox shares shot up 10 percent. Fox is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\u201cWe see the real strategy here as Fox content helping Disney build out its direct-to-consumer strategy,\u201d Steven Cahall, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note.As growth in the traditional cable business slows because of cord cutting, Disney also sees value in Hulu, which focuses on programming aimed at adults, including the Emmy-winning \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d Disney owns 30 percent of Hulu now. Fox also holds a 30 percent share, with the balance owned by Comcast and Time Warner.As part of the talks, Disney also looked at buying Fox\u2019s minority stake in Sky, the Britain-based pay-television service. Fox has been trying to buy all of Sky, but has so far been stymied by regulatory approvals.For 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, such a sale would amount to an acknowledgment that it cannot compete against media colossuses like AT&T and Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal. Companies like Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google are also expanding into entertainment.Mr. Murdoch tried to buy Time Warner in 2014 for $89 billion but dropped the effort after Time Warner spurned the offer.With some of its assets sold, Fox would remain a powerful player in television news and sports, two niches that remain highly valued by advertisers. The talks with Disney did not include the sale of Fox\u2019s broadcasting network, Fox News or Fox\u2019s sports holdings.In its last fiscal year, which ended on June 30, 21st Century Fox had $28.5 billion in revenue, a 4 percent increase from a year earlier, and $2.95 billion in profit attributable to Fox shareholders, a 7 percent increase. Much of that profit came from Fox\u2019s cable television unit, of which Fox News is the largest contributor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "God Should Sue Roy Moore", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, one of the most sanctimonious moralizers in American politics has been Roy Moore, the longtime Bible-thumper in Alabama who crusaded against gays, transgender people, Islam and \u201csexual perversion.\u201dThe victim said that Moore, then a 32-year-old assistant district attorney, drove the girl to his house, removed her clothes and touched her sexually. Under Alabama law, that apparently constitutes sexual abuse in the second degree. If you want an example of a politician who lost support and was arrested for less egregious behavior, consider Anthony Weiner, the former Democratic member of Congress, who is now in prison for sexting a 15-year-old girl.The Post found three other women who said that Moore pursued them when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. The women did not contact the Post and were initially reluctant to speak.This is of course a larger pattern in American life. As one reader put it on my Facebook page: \u201cThose who moralize most, sin most.\u201dThat\u2019s not always true, and sanctimonious hypocrites inhabit the left as well as the right: Harvey Weinstein participated in a \u201cwomen\u2019s march.\u201d But we\u2019re at a watershed moment in the aftermath of the Weinstein case, trying to end impunity for sexual assault, and allegations against our leaders are even more serious than those against our entertainers. And, frankly, it\u2019s just staggering to see \u201cfamily values\u201d conservatives making excuses for child molestation.Sigh. When Christians cite the Bible to defend child molestation, Jesus should sue for defamation.Looking back, some of the grossest immorality of the late 20th century had nothing to do with gay bath houses, as preachers sometimes suggested, but rather with the blowhard televangelists who suggested that AIDS was God\u2019s punishment of gay men. This smirking moralizing slowed the response to AIDS and arguably resulted in millions dying unnecessarily all over the world.We all make compromises \u2014 I supported Bill Clinton in 1992 over George H.W. Bush, whom I thought was personally more moral \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t require downplaying the inexcusable. I used to complain that conservatives believe that morality is about only personal behavior, while liberals believe it is only about policy positions, while actually it\u2019s about both. Sadly, some of the \u201cfamily values\u201d conservatives now don\u2019t seem to care about either private or public morality.As it happened, just before the revelations about Moore became public, I visited leaders of an inspiring tri-faith project in Omaha, where a church, a synagogue and a mosque are partnering on a shared site to build empathy and understanding. I asked the pastor involved, Rev. Eric Elnes, for his reaction to Moore.\u201cBlazing with self-righteous indignation toward others is often what people use to hide their own sins in the shadows,\u201d Elnes said. \u201cThis is probably why Jesus\u2019 biggest problem \u2014 by far \u2014 was with the self-righteous. When it came to those whom society cast away as \u2018sinners,\u2019 Jesus was repeatedly gentle, gracious, encouraging, and forgiving, but he continually castigated the self-righteous.\u201dElnes added: \u201cI\u2019ve never understood why certain Christians are so eager to turn the United States into a Christian country when their time would be so much better spent turning their churches into Christian churches.\u201dRoy Moore today is a challenge for those who see themselves as good and decent people of faith: If you find yourself excusing child molestation, then you are driven not by morality or faith, but simply by the emptiest kind of tribalism.An earlier version misspelled the name of Alabama\u2019s state auditor. He is Jim Zeigler, not Ziegler.Advertisement"}

For a luxury brand, what\u2019s the point of a store, at least a bricks-and-mortar store?\u201dBut the solution, say several retail innovators, is not the end of bricks and mortar, as some in the industry once anticipated.\u201cThere was a time six or seven years ago when there was only talk of pure play e-commerce,\u201d said Stephanie Phair, the chief strategy officer of Farfetch, the marketplace and retail platform that helps brands do business online. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen from a millennial consumer behavior point of view is customers really want that joined-up online and offline experience.\u201dWhat that means is a renovation of the old bricks-and-mortar ideal. Instead of the arms race for the biggest location on the most desirable street, a new model focused on multifunctional, integrated stores is gaining currency: less storehouses of product than event spaces, classrooms, community centers, showrooms or studios.In the case of Oscar de la Renta, the two-story Marignan space will serve as not only the brand\u2019s retail home in Paris, but also the showroom for its four annual wholesale presentations. Jeang Kim, an interior designer and sister of Laura Kim, the brand\u2019s co-creative director, is designing it as a modular space: Displays can be cleared for customer-entertaining events and dinners, like the brand has begun to hold in New York following its runway shows, and a tailoring studio will allow customers to have fittings and alterations done on site.But while the physical stores continue to drive business, Oscar de la Renta has been finding new customers outside of its usual channels. Since joining Farfetch earlier this year to expand its e-commerce, often by way of the site\u2019s personal shoppers, the company has seen sales in the range of $200,000 a month, mostly from new customers. \u201cTwo hundred thousand dollars, seemingly out of thin air,\u201d Mr. Bolen said.The brand\u2019s stores now are inviting those personal shoppers to visit, to learn more about the collections. And they, in turn, may take their clients to the physical shops.The model for success, as Mr. Bolen sees it, is a combination of on- and off-line. \u201cWe think bricks and mortar is going to be a critical part of it, but a very different part than it\u2019s been in the past,\u201d Mr. Bolen said. \u201cBricks-and-mortar stores \u2014 those aren\u2019t necessarily advantages any more.\u201d Especially in second-tier markets, he added, \u201cstores might be a real millstone.\u201dWhere brands affiliated with major luxury groups, like LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering, once had a clear competitive advantage in negotiating for real estate, given their ability to leverage entire portfolios of brands, smaller companies like Oscar de la Renta and the upstart London-based evening wear label Galvan are finding the playing field leveled by the rise of the smaller shop.\u201cI was with these very big brands that sell tens of thousands of units a week and have flagship stores,\u201d said Paul O\u2019Regan, the chief executive of Galvan, who previously was an executive at the Gucci Group (now Kering) and Burberry. \u201cEveryone\u2019s closing stores around us and the fashion model\u2019s changing.\u201dGalvan just opened its first store, combining its work space and showroom with shopping for walk-in customers and by appointment. And its location in the Notting Hill area of London ensures lower overhead than on a luxury retail strip like Mount Street, a few miles east.Not only will the store have the current season\u2019s options but customers also may order from the next season\u2019s collection and browse past collections to have pieces revived in custom colors, working with personal shoppers or, in some cases, the founders themselves. Appointments also may be made at a client\u2019s home or office.\u201cWe wanted to throw away all of those preconceptions and say: \u2018What would be the dream scenario for a woman buying a dress?\u2019 \u201d Mr. O\u2019Regan said.Robert Burke, whose New York-based company has consulted on retail strategies for industry players including Ralph Lauren, Chlo\u00e9 and Bulgari, has seen such thinking emerge in recent years. Even the larger retailers, he said, \u201care looking at just how many flagships or large stores they really need. That format worked for decades and decades. With the growth of online, it doesn\u2019t seem to be working. Bigger isn\u2019t better, necessarily. More focused is better, I think. And more intimate and more personal.\u201dThe distinction, he added, was between the old idea of department stores and the emerging model of the \u201capartment store.\u201dMatchesFashion.com, the London-based retailer, began as a single bricks-and-mortar store in Wimbledon Village (called simply Matches). But while business from its (now three) stores has been dwarfed by its global e-commerce, as its rechristening as MatchesFashion.com suggests, the company is continuing to invest in new stores. After a year of testing smaller, homier stores as part of a pop-up program called \u201cIn Residence,\u201d it is scheduled to open a new permanent space (the company prefers not to call it a \u201cstore\u201d) at No. 5 Carlos Place in Mayfair in the spring.The space will have two floors of retail as well as floors for private shopping, but equally important will be the floor that is to house the company\u2019s broadcasting and content hub. Classes, panel discussions and events will be held there, all of which will be streamed on Facebook Live and YouTube, its social channels and its website. And all of it will be digitally shoppable.\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Ulric Jerome, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to create an enormous department store to have a reach that is 10 or 100 times bigger than that department store. The reach is way bigger than the physical space. But the physical space enables you to produce amazing content.\u201dThe Carlos Place store will have fewer choices than the full MatchesFashion.com range; it will be \u201cthe curation of the curation, and we\u2019ll change the product quite often,\u201d Mr. Jerome said. But iPads will allow browsing in-store, and all products will be available within 90 minutes for delivery within metropolitan London.But at the company\u2019s existing stores, 40 percent of the sales already are done via iPad. It reflects the reality that, for Matches, the online dwarfs the physical in every way: 95 percent of Matches\u2019 business is online, Mr. Jerome said, and 85 percent is done outside of Britain.Mr. Jerome has confidence in the hybrid online/offline model, with smaller physical and larger digital space.Even those brands born online are stepping into the physical world. The RealReal, the online luxury consignment giant \u2014 it receives 8,000 to 10,000 consignment items per day, according to Julie Wainwright, its founder and chief executive \u2014 has spent a year testing pop-ups. And this month it is setting up a permanent retail space on Wooster Street in New York City.Ms. Wainwright is envisioning the space as community center as much as shop: RealReal\u2019s staff of experts, from watch gurus to fashion historians, will offer clinics and classes and offer appraisals, and the store will include a coffee bar and flower shop.It will also, lest one forget, have a curated selection of the website\u2019s clothes, shoes, accessories, jewelry and more: a fraction of the online offering, but a selection tailored to New York consumers.The RealReal\u2019s pop-up experiment last December in New York revealed a particular synergy between on- and off-line shopping, and a customer base ready and willing to combine the two, Ms. Wainwright said. And, she added, the average purchase at the pop-up was larger than the average one online.\u201cIf you walk into the store, everything you see will also be online, and anything you see online you can see in-store,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we saw when we ran the pop-up, some people went in, saw the item, thought about it, ordered it online that night and picked it up in the store that next morning.\u201dSuch synergy is what drives Ms. Wainwright, and others like her, toward their new approach. While the death knell for the bricks-and-mortar store has been premature, the online experience is never far away.\u201cThere are going to be iPads everywhere,\u201d Ms. Wainwright said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Life for Thanksgiving Ingredients", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fight against food waste is not a new one. Stale bread, for instance, has long been precious in bread-eating cultures, where to waste even a slice is a kind of sin. A hard baguette, a loaf that\u2019s too dry to cut, even the leftover heels and crusts: all have potential in the kitchen.There are lots of traditional recipes meant to use up old bread, which excels at absorbing flavors. There\u2019s panzanella, the Italian bread salad, or fattoush, a Lebanese one made with pita. Spanish migas marries shards of old bread and olive oil. French onion soup, with its cheesy, soup-soaked toast, is among the more well-known strategies.A less-famous dish, but no less praiseworthy, is the panade.Imagine a sturdier onion soup or a soupier lasagna, made with bread instead of pasta, layered with cheese and vegetables, moistened with broth, and baked. Inside, it\u2019s delightfully soggy, while the top is golden, crisp and cheesy. A panade satisfies the way a really good grilled cheese sandwich does, or well-baked macaroni and cheese.This panade is essentially a savory bread pudding interspersed with layers of caramelized onions, winter squash and grated alpine cheese, such as Gruy\u00e8re or Comt\u00e9. The onions are the most important part. It\u2019s essential that they be slowly browned and well seasoned, so they add their flavor to the cooking liquid. You could also use another vegetable instead of squash, like stewed tomatoes or cooked leafy greens or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.To build this humble dish, you need slices from a sturdy hearth-baked loaf. A large, European-style sourdough whole-wheat bread, made with a wild yeast (levain) starter, is ideal. You can make a panade from day-old slices, but older slices that are completely dried out work fine, too.Nine accomplished writers share their stories of the holiday.If you don\u2019t have stale bread on hand, you can easily \u201cmake\u201d it. Keep your sliced bread in a cloth or paper bag, and let it dry slowly. As long as it can breathe, it will not mold. It will be there when you need some homemade bread crumbs or croutons.Water is a fine choice, with so many onions and herbs in the dish, but a quickly made vegetable broth will add another dimension of flavor. Simmer 6 cups water with 2 cups (combined) chopped leeks, onions and celery. Toss in a bay leaf or a thyme sprig and some squash peelings and cook for 30 minutes. But good chicken or beef broth are also options.You might consider a panade as a substitute for bread stuffing and serve it alongside a roasted holiday bird. On other cool days, it shines as a hearty, warming meatless meal, served along with a crisp winter salad and sent to the table in all its molten glory.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Yemen Crumbles, One Town Is an Island of Relative Calm", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarib JournalMARIB, Yemen \u2014 As much of Yemen slides toward famine, residents of this dusty desert town can now buy food many locals had never tasted before: pizza, hamburgers and ice cream.While the country is divided between competing factions, the government of Marib Province has used oil revenues and tribal politics to lessen the blows of war, providing a level of security and services lacking elsewhere. Its relative stability has attracted Yemenis fleeing more violent areas, some of whom have in turn brought money to buy property and start businesses.\u201cIt is a success in exceptional circumstances,\u201d said Abdul-Razaq Naqib, a production supervisor for Yemen\u2019s Safer oil company. \u201cLike digging through rock with your fingers,\u201d he said, using a Yemeni saying for doing the impossible.During a recent four-day trip to Marib with a group of Western journalists and researchers, I saw a town struggling for a sense of normalcy \u2014 and even progress \u2014 despite the collapsed country around it.\u201cWe can\u2019t stop the war in Yemen right now, but at least we can cause more conversation about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to bring the world to Yemen and bring Yemen to the world.\u201dMarib\u2019s unlikely success is partly a symptom of the near complete shattering of the Yemeni state, which has left regions to fend for themselves in providing life\u2019s basics for their people.But the ingredients that make it work \u2014 warm ties with Saudi Arabia, oil and gas reserves, and a forward-looking governor \u2014 make it unlikely to be easily replicated elsewhere. And despite the progress here, security threats and poverty remain.Central to Marib\u2019s rise has been the provincial governor, Sultan Al-Aradah, our host, who provided the armed convoy that retrieved us from the airport, guarded our hotel and drove us around.He clearly wanted to show off his town\u2019s progress while elevating his political profile. It worked. After the local news media reported on our visit, Yemen\u2019s president and prime minister both called to congratulate him.Marib\u2019s growth has surprised locals.Until a few years ago, the town had only a few paved roads, and clashes between tribes raged often. The Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda is active in the province, and American drone strikes often kill people thought to be militants.\u201cIt was Marib\u2019s fate to confront it,\u201d Mr. Aradah said of the rebel attack. \u201cWe tried to face the danger to us with one hand and to build with the other hand.\u201dSince then, as talks aimed at ending the war have stalled, Mr. Aradah has kept his focus local.He has a few advantages. Marib Province produces much of Yemen\u2019s oil and gas, and Mr. Aradah\u2019s administration now collects 20 percent of the proceeds, allowing it to pay salaries and finance infrastructure projects.New roads cross the city, and a soccer stadium is rising downtown that will have turf imported from Germany, local officials said. Mr. Aradah is planning an international airport.Saudi Arabia has long maintained ties with Marib tribal leaders, including Mr. Aradah, and leads a coalition that is bombing the Houthis and has a base in Marib.The town\u2019s relative security has attracted Yemenis displaced by the war, and its population has swelled. Precise statistics are hard to come by, but the United Nations says that 73,000 people who fled other parts of the country have settled in Marib Province, in addition to its original population of 340,000. Local officials say the number of displaced is much higher.While security concerns prevented us from roaming freely, during tours organized by the governor\u2019s office we saw displaced people crowded into unfinished buildings, covering their windows with plastic and cardboard.Local historic sites associated with the legendary Queen of Sheba are neglected and strewn with trash. Violence has kept tourists away for years, and they are unlikely to return soon.At a cultural night in a large tent near the governor\u2019s office, a band played, dancers leapt in the sand and a gray-haired man sang mournfully, \u201cWhoever loses gold can find it in a jewelry shop, but whoever loses the homeland land will not find it anywhere.\u201dOther sites brimmed with optimism.\u201cMarib has become a refuge for all Yemenis,\u201d said Mohammed Abdul-Khaliq, a media student at the town\u2019s public university who had fled to Marib after the Houthis took over his hometown.Turmoil had shuttered the university, administrators said, but it reopened last year with 2,700 students. Now it has more than 5,000, and tin classrooms have been erected to handle the overflow.Students who had fled from elsewhere said they mixed well with locals. I met two young women in black abayas and face veils who were studying physics. One, Rasmiya Matkour, said her family had fled Sana out of fear that they would die in Saudi airstrikes meant for the Houthis.Her friend, Sheema Mohsin, a Marib native, said she had been amazed at how the town had changed, with new restaurants, better roads and a park for children.But the war was never far away. On the day of our hospital visit, a rocket believed to have been fired by the Houthis landed in an open area and an explosion of unknown origin killed a young boy. On our first night, a strike that locals assumed to be from an American drone killed four people believed to be Qaeda militants.On the edge of town, a \u201cmartyrs\u2019 cemetery\u201d of sandy graves and simple headstones stretched nearly to the horizon. It did not exist a few years ago, but now holds the remains of hundreds of men, women and children.At Marib\u2019s general hospital, most of the patients were war victims.In a workshop, technicians crafted artificial limbs for patients wounded by land mines, and the hospital had taken in so many wounded fighters that young men packed its pediatric ward.Six lay on beds in one room. One was covered in bandages and moaning; his car had been blown up as he entered a military base, nurses said. The next had a broken arm and bullet holes in his shoulder. Yet another had been shot through the stomach by a sniper.Next door were six more men, including Khalil al-Kual, 20, a soldier who had stepped on a land mine, losing his left foot and peppering his other limbs with shrapnel.\u201cI\u2019ll get a fake limb and go back to the front,\u201d he said.When asked how the war would end, he replied: \u201cThe only solution is with God.\u201dMr. Aradah, the governor, said he had worked to increase the rule of law, but problems persist.A university student, Somaya Sanea, said that her husband, Mohsin al-Awadi, had been dragged from his cellphone shop by security forces after a Facebook post in his name criticized local political figures. His wife and their infant son have not seen him since.\u201cEven if someone is a criminal, they can\u2019t put him away and not give his family any news,\u201d she said.Khalid Baglan, the head of a local youth organization, said security forces had attacked him and his colleagues in October when they protested the appointment of a new security chief for the province.One of his friends died from a gunshot wound, and three are still detained, he said.Sadam al-Adwar, a local human rights activist, said that such issues appeared to be less common than in other parts of Yemen, but that he knew of more than 10 people who had been detained for apparent political reasons.\u201cPolitical cases never ever go to the court,\u201d he said.Still, the town\u2019s rise has brought other natives home, and highlighted the potential for development in Yemen when basic security can be provided.Mohammed Zubaiyen, the business manager of large family enterprise with interests across the Persian Gulf, said the family had moved its businesses out of Yemen in 2011 as turmoil spread.Now, they\u2019re back, launching an $8 million venture to build a new, modern district mixing residential and commercial properties, he said.Other projects have picked up, too, like the failed mall his family built in 2006. After sitting largely vacant for years, its 104 shops are full, he said, and the family is considering building more.\u201cThere is a future for malls in Marib,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Arthur Schlesinger\u2019s \u2018Disuniting of America\u2019 Lives On", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayAmid what was becoming a debate among left-leaning academics and populist tribunes like Rush Limbaugh and Lynne Cheney, Schlesinger sought to define a liberal alternative to what he described as militant multiculturalism on the left and bigoted monoculturalism on the right: \u201cThe monoculturalists are hyperpatriots, fundamentalists, evangelicals, laissez-faire doctrinaires, homophobes, anti-abortionists, pro-assault-gun people.\u201d Of the two groups, Schlesinger considered the monoculturalists a greater threat: \u201cLeft-wing political correctness is an irritation and a nuisance. It becomes a threat to the young only when it invades the public schools.\u201d In contrast: \u201cRight-wing political correctness catches kids before they are old enough to take care of themselves and in environments where they are rarely exposed to clashes of opinion. It is a weapon with which small-town bigots, conducting pogroms against Darwin, Marx, J.D. Salinger, Judy Blume and other villains, seize control of school committees and library boards.\u201dAccording to Schlesinger, \u201cMonoculturalists abuse history as flagrantly as multiculturalists. They sanitize the past and install their own set of patriotic heroes and myths.\u201d In a chapter titled \u201cHistory the Weapon,\u201d Schlesinger acknowledges what he sees as the valid complaints of multiculturalists: \u201cAmerican history was long written in the interests of white Anglo-Saxon Protestant males. My father, growing up in the 1890s in Xenia, a small Ohio town containing large contingents of Germans, Irish and blacks, one day asked his father, who had come from Germany as a child and whose hero was Carl Schurz, the American general, politician and reformer, why the schoolbooks portrayed England as the one and only mother country. My grandfather\u2019s wry comment was that apparently the only Germans worth mentioning were \u2018the Hessians who had fought on the wrong side in the War for Independence.\u2019 Irish and blacks fared even less well in schoolbooks, and the only good Indians were dead Indians. Non-WASPs were the invisible men (and women) in the American past.\u201dSchlesinger notes one predictable response by minorities to their exclusion from mainstream historical texts and commemorations: \u201cThe ethnic enclaves thus developed a compensatory literature.\u201d To illustrate this, he quotes from the Irish-American scholar John V. Kelleher about articles claiming \u201cthat the Continental Army was 76 percent Irish, or that many of George Washington\u2019s closest friends were nuns or priests.\u201d However badly the \u201cwhite ethnics\u201d suffered from Anglo-Saxon Protestant condescension, Schlesinger notes, blacks, Latinos and Native Americans suffered far worse: \u201cThe situation is radically different for nonwhite minorities facing not snobbism but racism.\u201dBut Schlesinger maintains that what he calls \u201ccompensatory history\u201d is bad history, whether it takes the form of Afrocentrism, or the claim that other regions have falsely taken credit for inventions that originated in Africa, or what he, following Kelleher, calls \u201cthe there\u2019s-always-an-Irishman-at-the-bottom-of-it-doing-the-real-work approach to American history.\u201d These views ceased to be harmless folly when their holders enlisted the support of federal, state or local governments to impose them as official versions of history, Schlesinger argues: \u201c \u2018Who controls the past controls the future,\u2019 runs the Party slogan in George Orwell\u2019s \u20181984\u2019; \u2018who controls the present controls the past.\u2019 \u201dAt worst, Schlesinger writes, the sanctioning of state ethnonational ideologues could Balkanize American society further. He denounces the federal 1974 Ethnic Heritage Studies Program Act because it \u201cignored those millions of Americans \u2014 surely a majority \u2014 who refused identification with any particular ethnic group.\u201d Schlesinger may have seen himself in the latter group. His paternal ancestors included Prussian Jews and Austrian Catholics, while his mother was a descendant of the Mayflower colonists and supposedly related to the 19th-century American historian George Bancroft.\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound too apocalyptic about these developments,\u201d Schlesinger writes. Indeed, unlike many of his contemporaries who criticized multiculturalism, he did not see Latino immigration as either a linguistic or a social challenge to American national unity. Schlesinger noted: \u201cAs for Hispanic-Americans, first-generation Hispanics born in the United States speak English fluently, according to a Rand Corporation study; more than half of second-generation Hispanics give up Spanish altogether.\u201d Subsequent social science studies by Stephen Trejo, Richard Alba and others have confirmed that marriage outside of the group and erosion of ethnic identity tends to increase with each generation of Latinos, as it did in the case of European immigrant diasporas in the United States in the past.Like other memorable tracts for the times, \u201cThe Disuniting of America\u201d blends passages of enduring relevance with much that has become obsolete. Today, what is most striking about this book and other entries in the late-20th-century battle of the books is the assumption shared by all sides in the canon wars that the fate of the nation might depend on the content of the curriculum, as determined by academic experts.Since Schlesinger wrote, there has been a collapse in the authority of establishments of all kinds, not just academics. In the age of Twitter and Facebook and 24-hour cable news, public intellectuals like Schlesinger, based in the academy or in journalism, have lost influence over public opinion to movie stars, cable commentators, pop musicians and late-night comedians.Perhaps the greatest change has involved the declining status of liberal arts education and the historical studies at its core. In response to decades of slower-than-expected growth and heightened foreign competition, students deserted the humanities for more practical degrees like business. Meanwhile, in the 2000s and 2010s the bipartisan elite shared a new consensus that national success depended not on widespread liberal arts education but on student proficiency in science, technology, engineering and math. The debate over federal \u201cno child left behind\u201d standards that aimed to increase the number of Americans who go into engineering or science eclipsed the debates over the content of the American historical pantheon. The only academics who seem to find audiences among today\u2019s elite are economists and social scientists who claim to know how to boost gross domestic product or manipulate human behavior.Today the canon wars have given way to the icon wars. Although the focus of controversy has shifted from the contents of undergraduate education to the historical figures commemorated by statues and currency, debates over America\u2019s past continue to mirror debates over America\u2019s present and future. To the challenges of teaching history in a way that is at once accurate and inclusive, Schlesinger remains an insightful guide.Michael Lind, a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, is the author of \u201cLand of Promise: An Economic History of the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What if You Knew Alzheimer\u2019s Was Coming for You?", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "Six years ago, at age 49, Julie Gregory paid an online service to sequence her genes, hoping to turn up clues about her poor circulation, blood-sugar swings and general ill health. Instead she learned she had a time bomb hidden in her DNA: two copies of a gene variant, ApoE4, that is strongly linked to Alzheimer\u2019s. Most Americans with this genotype go on to develop late-onset dementia.\u201cAlzheimer\u2019s was the furthest thing from my mind,\u201d Ms. Gregory told me. \u201cI never thought I was at risk. When I saw my results, I was terrified.\u201dWhen Ms. Gregory consulted with a neurologist about how to delay the onset of illness, he had four words for her: \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d After all, no drug had proven effective in reversing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And preventive measures like diet and exercise, the neurologist told her, would do no good.Ms. Gregory is not the sort of person who pops into your mind when you think of Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 youngish, healthy and sharp-minded. But she represents a type of sufferer we are likely to encounter more and more: those grappling with the looming threat of the disease rather than the disease itself.Scientists say they are on the cusp of developing blood tests that could detect the earliest signs of Alzheimer\u2019s damage in people in their 40s and 50s who have no obvious symptoms. Today, finding out whether dangerous plaques are building up in your brain requires either a PET scan at a cost of about $4,000 or a spinal tap. And while genetic tests can help predict risk, they don\u2019t tell us anything about the current state of your brain. Effective blood tests could reveal thousands \u2014 even millions \u2014 of people who are now living with a \u201cpre-Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d condition.Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.On Monday, Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft, wrote on his blog that \u201cmen in my family have suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d which means that he may have a high risk for dementia. He called for new approaches to combating the disease, including developing \u201ca more reliable, affordable and accessible diagnostic \u2014 such as a blood test.\u201d Mr. Gates also announced that he would be donating $100 million to fight Alzheimer\u2019s, which will no doubt help to make blood tests a reality.So you may be faced with some difficult choices within the next decade: Do you want to receive potentially alarming news about your cognitive health, or would you rather not? If you learn that you have a high risk for Alzheimer\u2019s, is that information you will want to keep private \u2014 from employers, clients, health insurers and others? Or will you want to openly embrace it as part of your identity and publicly advocate for a cure?In the difficult months after her genetic test, Ms. Gregory \u201cwanted to be with people who were going through the same devastation,\u201d so she sought out other ApoE4 carriers. In 2013, she and a few others started a nonprofit group and created a website (ApoE4.info) where the community could gather. Today the group has more than 2,000 members. They pore over medical journals, reach out to top researchers in the field and share notes about their experiments with diet, exercise and other lifestyle modifications.Many of the members maintain their anonymity for fear of being \u201couted\u201d as carriers of the gene variant. One member of the group \u2014 I\u2019ll call her D., after her first initial \u2014 told me that she feared public exposure almost as much as Alzheimer\u2019s itself.About 20 years ago, D. graduated from a top-tier law school. She spoke with rat-a-tat speed and juggled her many to-do lists in her mind. But in middle age, her memory began to tatter and she struggled sometimes to find words. She went to a hospital for a cognitive-health work-up and learned that she carries a single copy of the ApoE4 gene variant.She was alarmed. Her father, a neurologist, had retired in his 60s because his own mind felt \u201cwrong\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s likely he diagnosed the oncoming dementia in himself. \u201cI was just really scared of following in his footsteps,\u201d she said.But when D. joined the ApoE4 online community, other members reassured her that her risk profile was not as worrisome as it might seem. With only one copy of the \u201cbad\u201d ApoE4 gene variant and one \u201cgood\u201d variant, she has a much better outlook than those with two copies. She now feels that she managed to clear her brain fog in part by overhauling her diet and exercise habits. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t known about this gene,\u201d she said, \u201cwould I be on my stupid exercise bike first thing in the morning when I\u2019m hungry? No way.\u201dStill, D. has kept her genetic status a secret from all but her closest friends. \u201cIf you\u2019re working in a professional capacity, seeing clients who need to have confidence in your brain,\u201d she said, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t want them to know that you had this gene variant.\u201d She is afraid of being denied insurance and long-term disability care because of her genotype. And like many other ApoE4 carriers, she also worries about social stigma.Jason Karlawish, a professor of medicine and neurology at the University of Pennsylvania, studies how people at high risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease cope with that knowledge. \u201cWe have to make it socially acceptable to talk about having risk of getting dementia,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think that is one of the ground zero struggles we are going to face in the coming decades.\u201dMany health organizations discourage patients from learning their ApoE genotype. They warn that people may not be able to cope with bad news or will misinterpret the results. But according to Theresa, a member of the ApoE4 community who, like D., is protective of her privacy, it is paternalistic to decide how someone else should feel about the test. \u201cMy attitude is that you have to know the facts, analyze them and deal with them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sooner you know your gene status, the sooner you can start doing something about it.\u201dNot all cases of Alzheimer\u2019s can be traced to a particular gene variance, but for someone like Theresa \u2014 who has two copies of ApoE4 and is now in her late 50s \u2014 chances are high that she will be diagnosed with the disease within the next 10 to 20 years. Yet she said that this knowledge \u201chas been life-changing and positive.\u201d She now tracks her lipid levels, glucose levels and other biomarkers. When I interviewed her, she had just returned from skiing black-diamond trails in the Colorado mountains.David Holtzman, a neurologist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, has researched the ApoE gene for 25 years. But he has chosen not to look at his own ApoE4 genotype. Why do it, he asked me, when there is no drug or lifestyle strategy that is absolutely guaranteed to protect the brain? It would be far more useful if researchers could watch the disease as it spreads through the brain and wreaks its damage. That\u2019s why Dr. Holtzman and his colleagues are working on a method to detect the presence of markers in the blood that are red flags for brain illness.Everything about our relationship to Alzheimer\u2019s is in flux right now. The disease \u2014 once thought to be unpreventable \u2014 is beginning to look more like a multifactorial illness that might result from poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle, chronic inflammation, exposure to chemicals in the environment and genetics. Some scientists now describe Alzheimer\u2019s disease as another form of diabetes; others are pursuing a link between Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cardiovascular problems. And studies have shown a link between Alzheimer\u2019s and exposure to air pollution and head injuries. Many researchers in the field, including Dr. Holtzman, believe that the key to defeating Alzheimer\u2019s will be to catch it at the earliest possible moment and prevent it.It remains unclear whether lifestyle interventions can significantly delay cognitive decline. But the members of ApoE4 group believe that by banding together, sharing data and collaborating with scientists, they can improve their odds. \u201cWe are genetic pioneers, modern-day canaries in the coal mine, searching for and testing out strategies,\u201d reads the group\u2019s website. Rather than seeing themselves as victims of genetic bad luck, Ms. Gregory and her collaborators regard themselves as citizen scientists and activists who may be able to outsmart the disease.They are a reminder that diagnostic tests do more than predict our biological fates; they also perform a social and political function. They help turn strangers into a family, a tribe and, sometimes, a revolution. When the H.I.V. test became available in the 1980s, thousands of people suddenly felt connected to the disease. The test radicalized many of them, and those activists pushed for the reform of medical trials, requested a shorter drug approval process and fought against medical discrimination. Most consequentially, they demanded \u2014 and got \u2014 treatments that have extended the lives of AIDS patients by decades.So what would happen if something like an H.I.V. test for Alzheimer\u2019s were to exist in the near future, and millions of people found out that their brains were on the path to dementia? Dr. Alison Goate, a professor of neuroscience at Mount Sinai in New York, said the effects could be profound. Today there are no Alzheimer\u2019s survivors. That means that Alzheimer\u2019s patients \u201ccan\u2019t speak for themselves,\u201d she observed. Widespread blood tests could create an army of \u201cpre-Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d patients clamoring for breakthroughs in treatment.We need patient-advocates who can \u201cown\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s disease. They would represent a constituency other than that of the pharmaceutical companies that now control the conversation about the disease. A drug to prevent dementia could become the world\u2019s most profitable medicine. It\u2019s not a surprise to learn that one of the biggest insider-trading scandals in history involved a would-be Alzheimer\u2019s drug (which seemed effective in mouse brains but failed to help humans as much).When thousands of patients rise up, refuse to be stigmatized, discuss their symptoms and participate in research, science benefits. A new test for Alzheimer\u2019s could help to create that movement, but let\u2019s not wait. Twenty-five percent to 50 percent of us will show signs of Alzheimer\u2019s by the age of 85. When it comes to dementia, we all should consider ourselves vulnerable. No matter what genes you carry, your odds of developing cognitive problems increase as you age.In other words, welcome to the club: If you plan to live a long time, then you, too, belong to the high-risk group. Now what are you going to do about it?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the \u2018Resistance\u2019 Helped Democrats Dominate Virginia", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "FeatureFor campaign managers like Kathryn Sorenson, much of their job was simply channeling the enormous wave of energy that came their way.Supported byEven if she hadn\u2019t broken her neck, she most likely couldn\u2019t have taken even a few hours off work to attend the march: She was the manager, and sole employee, of the two-week-old David Reid for Delegate campaign. Sorenson met Reid on New Year\u2019s Day for a mutual interview; Reid, a well-kept, goateed father of two in his mid-50s, was a latecomer to politics, and was relieved when Sorenson agreed to lead his campaign for the House of Delegates, the 100-member lower chamber of Virginia\u2019s legislature. In her six years out of college, Sorenson had worked continuously on campaigns, all but one of them in Northern Virginia, and despite her youth, she exhibited the grim, sardonic cheer of the veteran operative.Sorenson agreed to work with a novice like Reid because he seemed committed to real issues, and he made a sincere first impression. Also, she liked his odds. Virginia\u2019s 32nd house district is part of Loudoun County, one of the fastest growing counties in the country and, by median income, the wealthiest. Verdant, indistinguishable subdivisions are laid out in self-contained loops between windowed blocks of strip mall and windowless blocks of data center. There are overpasses to nowhere; there are construction sites that look like Caterpillar sales lots as well as actual Caterpillar sales lots. The county and its schools are around 30 percent nonwhite, with a large immigrant population. (Sorenson\u2019s favorite local lunch spot is an Afghan kebab joint.) The 32nd went for Hillary Clinton by 19 points. There was, Sorenson quickly got into the habit of saying, \u201cabsolutely no reason this district has a Republican delegate.\u201dThey had come, she realized, on behalf of what she began to call \u201cthe pop-up groups.\u201d She went to as many of their meetings as she could and found that many of their members were largely unacquainted with politics, especially on the local level. Some of them weren\u2019t even county residents; they were from McLean, and Arlington, and D.C., and even Maryland. Though a majority of these meetings might have been better described as meetings about meetings, she nevertheless admired all these new faces and the vitality they were prepared to bring to what were ordinarily considered marginal down-ballot races.What Sorenson needed from these inchoate volunteer armies, however, was not a collective expression of outrage; it was reliable support for campaign practicalities like door-knocking and phone-banking, tasks that lacked the glamour and solidarity of marches and protests. Even those who could readily speak about state and local issues \u2014 how the Republicans in the House of Delegates had refused the Medicaid expansion and passed a sheaf of anti-abortion bills; how Loudoun County was the only district in Northern Virginia without full-day kindergarten; how somebody needed to put a stoplight at Waxpool and Demott, where Sorenson was almost killed \u2014 were rarely acquainted with the proper channels for action. They would talk about calling their representative, and Sorenson would say, \u201cThat\u2019s not a congressional thing, that\u2019s a state thing!\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s not a state thing, that\u2019s a supervisor thing! Call your supervisor!\u201d Sorenson showed them how to find out who their supervisors were. They wanted to write letters to Terry McAuliffe, the governor, about bathroom discrimination. She said: \u201cDon\u2019t write letters to Terry! The bathroom bill is dead, don\u2019t worry. It died in subcommittee, and even if it hadn\u2019t, Terry had already promised to veto it, so pick a better battle!\u201dTo get Reid on the ballot, Sorenson explained, the campaign needed to collect 125 signatures by March. The pop-up groups were happy to help, especially because Sorenson had a pleasant, easygoing appeal, not to mention a broken neck. Within a few weeks, she was given almost 600 names. She couldn\u2019t quite account for how it was done; these groups didn\u2019t have leadership, exactly, or if they did, they had large \u201csteering committees\u201d \u2014 and they could be touchy if you used the wrong word or gave one individual too much credit \u2014 but they used Facebook and they contacted friends of friends and somehow they got the signatures they needed. And not only that. Representatives from some groups got the required signatures, and then representatives from some other groups materialized to vet those signatures and remove inadvertent out-of-district signatories, and then still other representatives from different or maybe the same groups suggested they might help Sorenson by formatting all of that petition data so they could merge the relevant information with their master voter file. As long as Sorenson was explicit about what she needed, it all seemed to just ... happen.A majority of the pop-up groups were experiments in decentralized organizing, so individual chapters were free to expend their energy where and how they pleased. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia \u2014 and in particular to its 32nd district. Reid\u2019s district had no primary, for one thing, and seemed acutely winnable. It also had Sorenson. She was not only competent; she was, at least outwardly, calm. She also reached out to each group on its own terms, even if that effort alone absorbed three or four hours of each day. And she didn\u2019t want to seem exploitative, so she refused on principle to blast the groups\u2019 lists with what she called \u201chair-on-fire send-$5-now-or-the-world-will-end emails.\u201dThough in theory these groups had diverse goals, the impression they made on Sorenson was one of a great, reverberant longing. \u201cThere\u2019s just this huge energy,\u201d Sorenson told me, \u201cwith people saying, \u2018We want to do something right now, we want to effect change in this election.\u2019\u2009\u201d They were hard to keep track of: who was with which group, what each one cared about, which groups were subgroups or affinity groups of other groups, which had national umbrella organizations and which didn\u2019t, which terms of art groups preferred to describe their particular variety of leaderlessness. There were chapters and huddles and pods, and they used Google Forms or Google Docs or Eventbrites or Meetups. She found herself scrolling through endless Facebook commentaries in search of group moderators or other sources of provisional authority.She began to build her own Google Doc as a central storehouse for all the fugitive information. This color-coded document included but was not limited to, in no particular order, the following groups: 31st Street Swing Left; Code Blue; Indivisible Del Ray; Indivisible VA Assembly 42; Network NoVA; NOVANation Coalition; Sister District DC; Sister District Maryland; Swing Left; Together We Will NoVA; Vienna Neighbors United; VOTE MOB VA; WofA (We of Action); ACT Empowered; We ARE the People Who Stand Up; Loudoun 4 Women\u2019s March on Washington; Hunter Mill Huddle; Arlington Huddle Action Network; Neighbors for a Blue Virginia; Ward 3 Democrats; the Resurgent Left; Turn It Blue DC (formerly Swing Left NE DC); Dining for Democracy; #Citizen. Sorenson got a kick out of the names the groups had given themselves. She loved one called the Huddlery.Sorenson\u2019s list included the names of the principals, to which she often felt obligated to append the qualification \u201c(co-leader?)\u201d or \u201c(steering committee member?).\u201d She documented their purpose, insofar as she could divine it; her perception of their viability (\u201call talk no plans\u201d); and their willingness to help the Reid campaign to, as her own hashtag put it, #flip32blue. Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way. Some, like Flippable, had former campaign people on staff; they just needed to hear the numbers and they\u2019d mail a check. Others, like the West L.A. Democratic Club, asked her questions for an hour before saying no. Some had clear purity tests \u2014 \u201cWill you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?\u201d \u201cWere you endorsed by Senator Sanders?\u201d \u2014 and Sorenson\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t always check all the boxes. Others were concerned that she didn\u2019t need the help badly enough.Sorenson did her best to put her candidate and their campaign up for adoption in a way that made their specific requirements clear. It was going to be expensive, for one thing. They had to raise at least $400,000, or $500,000 if she wanted her \u201cCadillac plan.\u201d The map of Loudoun County is a Mandelbrot set of nested subdivisions, and three of her precincts \u2014 the Villas, Lansdowne Woods and the Ashby Ponds retirement community \u2014 are gated and thus \u201cunknockable,\u201d which meant the campaign would have to double down on phone banking. This would require a lot of coordination. Running against a seven-year incumbent, Reid also faced a huge deficit in name recognition, which meant that early preparatory canvassing was just as important as a late turnout effort.Money and time would always be the hardest asks, but while Sorenson was still neck-braced and understaffed, there were plenty of basic start-up tasks to complete. One outfit offered to make the campaign an easily updatable website. Another sent a member to take photographs, which saved the campaign $700. Sorenson offhandedly mentioned that it would be nice to have a spreadsheet itemizing all of Tag Greason\u2019s votes in his seven years in the House of Delegates \u2014 bill number, how he voted, why it matters. She had it within hours. Yet another organization delivered print-at-home postcards that recalled classic Americana, marked with parks and schools and polling places; she wanted people to keep in mind that the 32nd district was an actual place. She loved the postcards, even if she had to send repeated reminders about which disclosures were necessary to make them compliant with campaign-finance law.It wasn\u2019t lost on her that some of the work being done was redundant, and that some of her interactions required more effort than they ultimately returned, but Sorenson understood that the new spirits were fragile. She tried to remind herself that each group brought its own perspective or talent, even as her attempt to outline their special characteristics revealed a litany of special needs. One group was part of a Jewish organization and thus couldn\u2019t canvass on Saturdays. Another one wanted to know how to get over to Loudoun without paying tolls, and many of its members were older and needed printed directions or car pools. But Sorenson\u2019s willingness to keep track of and accommodate all these preferences gave her word-of-mouth fame. No research trial \u2014 volunteer-coordination software, fund-raising by text message \u2014 was too small or bug-ridden for her to disdain, and she joked that she was first in every line to serve as a guinea pig.In June, Shaun Daniels, then an executive director of an influential PAC called Win Virginia, told me, \u201cNo one anywhere is working with more outside groups than Kathryn.\u201d Democratic politics had entered a new era of experimentation, he said, and \u201cthis here is ground zero.\u201dThe other salient election was the recent runoff between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. Sorenson herself was not disposed to draw any big lessons from Ossoff\u2019s defeat, which she was by nature unable to regard as a leading indicator on the president, or the Democratic Party, or the role of outside patrons. It seemed to her that the campaign was waged about as well as it could have been in a district that was close to impossible for a Democrat to win. For many of her volunteers, however, the loss felt like a dispiriting prelude to what was supposed to be a stirring campaign kickoff.Early in the morning, a crowd of campaign staff members, longstanding volunteers and outside irregulars milled around Reid\u2019s home in anticipation of their canvassing shifts. The family\u2019s two shiba inus were underfoot, the coffee table was decorated with back issues of astronomy and archaeology magazines and the whole place smelled faintly but persistently of maple syrup. There were cars from Massachusetts and Missouri, and Reid joked more than once about how he kept meaning to give out an award for the person who traveled the farthest to be there. The volunteers were mostly women, and mostly middle-aged, and had come outfitted for day hikes of moderate exertion. Whenever one of them was asked which group, if any, she had come with, there was a perceptible pause as she thought about the profusion of mailers in her inbox and posts in her Facebook feed.Those there for the first time were nervous about how they would be greeted. A woman from Vienna, Va., named Francesca, in capri-length cargo pants, sturdy boots and a beaded necklace, raised her hand. She had come on behalf of half a dozen groups. \u201cAm I going to look like a carpetbagger, or should I say that I care so much that I came here from elsewhere?\u201dReid looked to Sorenson before responding. \u201cNobody will ask you because you look like the district \u2014 it\u2019s pretty diverse here. We joke that we give an award for the person who came the furthest. All of this, here, it\u2019s really starting to make a difference.\u201d The volunteers were shuffled through a brief orientation, which was longer on Reid\u2019s biography \u2014 a foster child who was the first in his family to go to college; a local businessman who sent his daughters to the public schools; a retired Navy Reserve intelligence officer who gave 23 years of service to his country \u2014 than it was on his positions. But the point of the summer canvass was deliberately introductory.Francesca, the woman from Vienna, cleared a space for me in her cluttered minivan. She\u2019d worked on clean-energy policy, she told me en route, but her entire department was recently eliminated. We passed a new data center across from a data center under construction. She delivered an impassioned monologue as she tried to pay attention to the GPS; she had an air of spiky distraction, as if stopping to scowl at news alerts while watching a TV show. \u201cNow the Klan is out in Charlottesville when they take down the Confederate monuments. Just the other day I went to the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center for the first time in my life. It\u2019s intersectionality. If affluent people like me aren\u2019t caring about Black Lives Matter, well \u2014 it kind of opened my eyes. We can\u2019t ever not be engaged again. It\u2019s like the Founding Fathers\u2019 idea of the yeoman government. My progressive friends, they\u2019re on Facebook but they\u2019re not out canvassing and phone-banking. There\u2019s nothing else going on in \u201917, and there\u2019s all this pent-up energy.\u201dFrancesca said she had gone to the Women\u2019s Summit the previous morning and left exhilarated, but what she took away from the conference wasn\u2019t wholly clear. Each delegate emphasized the importance of gerrymandering, and health care, and school funding, and rural broadband, and the state of the roads. If the national Democratic Party really was in crisis, torn between cultural politics and pocketbook issues, it certainly wasn\u2019t visible at the summit. The biggest applause line of the day came from Danica Roem, a transgender former journalist and \u201cfreshman member of the Democratic Party\u201d who won a surprise victory in a four-way primary in District 13, to the south. \u201cMy opponent,\u201d she said with national-stage charisma, \u201ccares more about where I go to the bathroom than how you get to work!\u201d Francesca, however, seemed to have little interest in low-stakes issues like the office vacancies on Manassas Drive. \u201cWe\u2019re literally fighting for our democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u2019\u2009\u201dWe got out to canvass in a subdivision of modest flagpoled homes on branching cul-de-sacs. Francesca traipsed over people\u2019s lawns and rapped hard on doors. The hit rate with canvassing is always low, and over two hours on a hot and cloudless Sunday, we encountered only half a dozen families at home.In the few conversations Francesca did have, she was invariably friendly and polite, but her pitch about Reid was mostly that he was a great guy; every once in a while she remembered to say that he was in favor of full-day kindergarten districtwide or distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. In her one extended interaction, a young mother began by saying that her family cared above all about full-day kindergarten. She had only ever voted in presidential elections, she admitted, but then managed, over the course of five minutes, to convince herself that she was wrong to do so.\u201cI don\u2019t vote in the local but I guess I really need to now,\u201d she said.\u201cWell, I was never out canvassing before, either!\u201d Francesca said.Some volunteers I accompanied were more careful to stay off lawns, or more fluent in the local issues, or had greater experience with the mechanics of political campaigns; some remembered that a \u201c1\u201d on the voter-information sheet meant most likely to vote for David Reid, while others were sure that great enthusiasm was recorded with a \u201c5.\u201d On the record, they were always positive about their huddles and steering committees, even if off the record they wondered whether the welter of organizations meant duplicative or otherwise-inefficient resource allocation. No one, however, seemed frustrated by the fact that they reached only a handful of voters, or discouraged from making a return trip.By the end of the weekend, more than 40 volunteers had knocked on more than 2,500 doors. Sorenson rarely allowed herself to be thrilled by anything, but she conceded some satisfaction that these were patently terrific results. This wasn\u2019t to say that everything had gone smoothly. When canvassing was over, Sorenson checked the campaign\u2019s email account to find a restrained but irate message from a community member, upset that his home\u2019s \u201cno soliciting\u201d sign was ignored. The volunteer stood and argued about the First Amendment. The voter leaned Republican, he continued, but had always voted on both sides of the aisle, and from what he knew about David Reid, he was interested. This encounter, however, had cost them his vote.This didn\u2019t sound to Sorenson like one of her own people. She looked up the planned itineraries of one of the outside groups \u2014 an organization dedicated to voter-suppression issues \u2014 and found that it must have been someone from its camp. Sorenson wasn\u2019t sure there was much she could do. \u201cThey have a different list, and a different script, and different priorities. We tell our people in training not to get into constitutional battles, but each group does its own thing.\u201dThe major development was an unexpected shift in the dynamics at the top of the ticket. The governor and the state\u2019s two senators were Democrats; the pipe dream for November 2017 was to bring the State Legislature into line. In August, however, the Republican gubernatorial candidate \u2014 a former lobbyist, R.N.C. chairman and all-around establishment figure named Ed Gillespie \u2014 hired an erstwhile Trump campaign operative and reinvented himself in the president\u2019s image. He began to speak out against the removal of Confederate monuments and in favor of the travel ban. He spoke about the danger of \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d even though Virginia has none, and ran campaign ads about Latino gang violence that prompted a rare public rebuke from Obama.It was hard to tell how this affected Sorenson\u2019s race, though the summer poll wasn\u2019t good; Reid was down by seven. But the race, Sorenson knew, was always going to come down to turnout. The weekend after Labor Day would hopefully set the tone for the fall, when, with any luck, the name recognition they\u2019d worked to foster might begin to translate into voter commitments. When returning summer volunteers arrived, they found a more mature operation: there was a sign-in table in the entryway, three times the turnout and a campaign staff large enough for one person to do check in, one person to divide the turf and a third to guide the orientations.Reid as a candidate seemed looser and more confident. He\u2019d received recent endorsements from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, and was willing to talk about more difficult subjects. \u201cThere\u2019s some hesitation among people of color to put up yard signs\u201d for a Democrat, he told a group of volunteers, \u201cafter what we\u2019ve seen, down in Charlottesville and elsewhere, with the emboldening of white supremacists.\u201d He did not seem like the sort of person who\u2019d ever had reason to refer to white supremacy. He was, however, still making the same joke about giving an award to whoever had traveled the farthest to volunteer.For every volunteer who saw fit to challenge the campaign\u2019s authority or its expertise, however, there were half a dozen there for a political education. If everybody hated the tolls, more than one canvasser asked, why were they so high? Well, the campaign answered, the Australian firm that owned the Dulles Greenway had donated $8,000 to Delegate Greason. There was something about the modesty of that figure that got even distant volunteers incensed on behalf of the local community. The conflicts surrounding Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel and the emoluments clause were exasperating but remote in their immensity, whereas a $6 toll for a $2.29 bottle of milk was an affront you could grasp.With 11 days to go before the election, their ground strategy shifted from the voter-commitment stage to the final get-out-the-vote effort; on the campaign\u2019s final Saturday, they enlisted 205 volunteers to go door to door helping voters articulate an explicit plan for when and how they\u2019d go to the polls on Tuesday. The race, as Sorenson predicted, was going to come down to turnout on the margins: their tracking poll had them in a dead heat. Sorenson\u2019s estimate was that Reid needed 13,150 votes to win, and it was easy for her to imagine that the final tallies would be within the 1 percent margin that would trigger an automatic recount. With the race tightening, Greason sent mailers that described Reid as a radical leftist who had taken \u201ctens of thousands of dollars from New York, Washington and California.\u201d Sorenson showed it to me and shrugged. \u201cWell, that last part\u2019s true.\u201dSorenson was grateful for all the money and help from her outside volunteers, but what most moved her was when she felt someone had made the organizational leap from political fury to political identification. When one of her Sister District captains in Maryland asked for a yard sign, Sorenson furrowed her brow and asked her why she wanted one on the other side of the river. The volunteer simply said, \u201cWe need to expand what we think of as our own backyard.\u201d Sorenson didn\u2019t have a lot of time for mawkishness, but that idea, she said, \u201cis just beautiful to me.\u201d And she could appreciate whatever it was that got people newly involved in politics and kept them there. If Indivisible wanted to call Virginia \u201cthe first statewide referendum on Trump,\u201d that was fine with her, as long as they didn\u2019t set expectations so high that their support couldn\u2019t survive a disappointment.The foot traffic \u2014 not just the usual folks from D.C. or Maryland, but people who came from California, Florida and Iowa \u2014 was so steady that the campaign began to run out of clipboards. Volunteers would arrive, muddy and soaked, peel off their clear ponchos and hand over their unreadably macerated voter rolls. By midafternoon, they were almost finished with the fifth complete pass they\u2019d done, over their 11-day \u201cmobilization window,\u201d of all 10,000 doors in their universe. Most returnees declared that everyone on their lists had either voted already or was just waiting for a spouse to come watch the kids; some of them stopped Sorenson to tell her stories about how they took a moment at the end of their shifts to circle back around and check on these promissory replies, and more often than not they encountered \u201cI voted\u201d stickers. Then they\u2019d be handed a new packet and sent back out into the rain. Someone in need of reprieve asked Sorenson when she planned to wrap things up for the day. \u201cWhen do you stop? If your nearest polling place closes at 7:00 and is two minutes away, you stop at 6:58.\u201dSorenson didn\u2019t feel she could really trust the numbers that were coming in \u2014 turnout, she thought, couldn\u2019t realistically be as high as it seemed to be \u2014 but by 4 o\u2019clock she could no longer ignore the fact that most polling places had already far exceeded the totals they usually showed in off years. She dealt with her mounting anxiety by making new spreadsheets to compare precinct-level historical data and devoted her last hour of her campaign\u2019s last day to one final round of phone-banking to voters in what she worried was her one underperforming precinct.The campaign party was at a favorite strip-mall wine bar. Sorenson went home to change, thinking she might have a moment to herself before the results came in, but by the time she and the rest of her team arrived, 90 percent of Loudoun\u2019s precincts were reporting. Reid\u2019s race was one of the first calls. He won with more than 17,000 votes, by at least 17 points. Shoals of well-wishers formed around Sorenson, touching her arms and shoulders and yelling through their tears. \u201cYou are so [expletive] awesome,\u201c one said. \u201cYou brought happiness back into our lives,\u201d said another.Sorenson made her way through the crowd slowly and with only a small, hesitant, curious smile. Every few minutes the growing crowd reacted to new results. Wins at the top of the ticket brought sighs of relief, but the shouted announcement of each successive delegate victory triggered gasps and whoops of astonishment: the first Asian-American woman, the first two Latina women, the first out lesbian, the first trans woman, an African-American woman, even a woman in a Trump district; altogether at least 11 new Democratic women, seven from Northern Virginia alone, in a swell that seemed likely to result in 16 flipped districts for a tied House. Eventually Sorenson sat down with her finance and field directors \u2014 the three young women, Reid later proclaimed, who organized a legion of volunteers and brought them to victory \u2014 to eat some cheese; she particularly liked the kind of Brie they had there, which is why they chose the venue for the party. She stopped to read a congratulatory text from \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s guy.\u201dHer finance director looked over at her and asked, through a flood of tears: \u201cHow are you so calm? I feel like we\u2019ve all been in our little bubble, but look\u201d \u2014 she gestured toward the television overhead \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re on MSNBC! How are you not crying?\u201dSorenson just smiled her smile of mellow detachment, and finally spoke. \u201cI just kind of want to throw my phone into the ocean.\u201dGideon Lewis-Kraus is a writer at large for the magazine.

Authorities had not yet named a suspect, but that didn\u2019t deter Mr. Williams, who is black, from speculating that the gunman was probably \u201ceither a Muslim or black.\u201dLater, after the shooter was identified as a white man named Devin P. Kelley, Mr. Williams posted a follow-up video. He claimed that Mr. Kelley was most likely a Bernie Sanders supporter associated with antifa \u2014 a left-wing anti-fascist group \u2014 who may have converted to Islam. Despite having no evidence for those claims, Mr. Williams argued them passionately, saying that photos of Mr. Kelley circulating online suggested that he was a violent liberal.\u201cSometimes, you can tell a lot from a person\u2019s picture,\u201d Mr. Williams said.YouTube has long been a haven for slapdash political punditry, but in recent months, a certain type of hyper-prolific conspiracist has emerged as a dominant force. By reacting quickly and voluminously to breaking news, these rapid-response pundits \u2014 the YouTube equivalent of talk radio shock jocks \u2014 have successfully climbed the site\u2019s search results, and exposed legions of viewers to their far-fetched theories.In a phone interview from his home in Houston, Mr. Williams told me that he had created more than 10,000 YouTube videos over an eight-year period, posting as many as 20 monologues per day, and racking up an estimated 200 million views.His hit productions have included fact-challenged videos like \u201cBarack and Michelle Obama Both Come Out The Closet,\u201d which garnered 1.6 million views, and \u201cHillary Clinton Is On Crack Cocaine,\u201d which had 665,000. He was admitted to YouTube\u2019s partner program, which allows popular posters to earn money by displaying ads on certain types of videos, and claims to have made as much as $10,000 a month from his channel.\u201cI like to call myself a reporter who reports the news for the common person,\u201d Mr. Williams said.Whether motivated by profit or micro-celebrity, the success of sensationalists like Mr. Williams has become a vexing problem for companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, which owns YouTube.These companies sort and prioritize information for their users, and most have built ranking systems that boost news from mainstream outlets over stories from less credible sources. But those algorithms can be gamed in breaking news situations by users who work fast, uploading their videos in the valuable minutes between when news breaks and when the first wave of legitimate articles and videos appears.\u201cBefore reliable sources put up stories, it\u2019s a bit of a free-for-all,\u201d said Karen North, a professor studying social media at the University of Southern California. \u201cPeople who are in the business of posting sensationalized opinions about the news have learned that the sooner they put up their materials, the more likely their content will be found by an audience.\u201dConservatives have argued that YouTube unfairly targets their videos while allowing liberal channels, such as The Young Turks, to post heated political commentary. And some dispute that there is any conscious gaming going on.Tech companies, already under fire for the ease with which they allowed Russia to interfere in last year\u2019s election, have also vowed to take a harder stance on domestic misinformation. Twitter\u2019s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, told congressional investigators last week that the company would take steps to keep false stories from being featured on trending topic pages.\u201cIt\u2019s a bad user experience, and we don\u2019t want to be known as a platform for that,\u201d Mr. Edgett said.In Mr. Williams\u2019s case, human intervention seems to have been necessary. On Tuesday, shortly after I asked YouTube some questions about Mr. Williams\u2019s account, all of his videos disappeared, and his profile was replaced by a message saying, \u201cThis account has been terminated due to multiple or severe violations of YouTube\u2019s policy prohibiting hate speech.\u201dMr. Williams, who said he had recently left his job as an operations manager at a hazardous materials plant to focus on full-time punditry, has tangled with YouTube\u2019s hate speech policies before. The company shut down one of his previous accounts for similar infractions, which he claimed cost him 250,000 subscribers and a lucrative income stream.\u201cIf YouTube didn\u2019t punish me,\u201d Mr. Williams said, \u201cI could easily be making over $30,000 a month.\u201dIn a statement, YouTube said that Mr. Williams\u2019s account was banned \u201cas soon as it was flagged to us,\u201d because its terms of service prohibit repeat rule-breakers from opening new accounts. It also said that its terms prohibit advertising from appearing on videos featuring \u201ccontroversial and sensitive events, tragedies, political conflicts, and other sensitive topics.\u201dEven before this week\u2019s crackdown, Mr. Williams was branching out. He sells cellphone ringtones on his website, and was considering starting his own paid streaming service. Tuesday night, just hours after he was banned by YouTube, Mr. Williams posted a video on Vimeo, another video-hosting platform. He pledged to keep insulting his favorite targets \u2014 Democrats, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama \u2014 and not shy away from controversy, no matter what the policies said.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be on YouTube anymore,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s too communist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can A.I. Be Taught to Explain Itself?", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "FeatureAs machine learning becomes more powerful, the field\u2019s researchers increasingly find themselves unable to account for what their algorithms know \u2014 or how they know it.Supported byKosinski has made a career of warning others about the uses and potential abuses of data. Four years ago, he was pursuing a Ph.D. in psychology, hoping to create better tests for signature personality traits like introversion or openness to change. But he and a collaborator soon realized that Facebook might render personality tests superfluous: Instead of asking if someone liked poetry, you could just see if they \u201cliked\u201d Poetry Magazine. In 2014, they published a study showing that if given 200 of a user\u2019s likes, they could predict that person\u2019s personality-test answers better than their own romantic partner could.After getting his Ph.D., Kosinski landed a teaching position at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and soon started looking for new data sets to investigate. One in particular stood out: faces. For decades, psychologists have been leery about associating personality traits with physical characteristics, because of the lasting taint of phrenology and eugenics; studying faces this way was, in essence, a taboo. But to understand what that taboo might reveal when questioned, Kosinski knew he couldn\u2019t rely on a human judgment.Kosinski first mined 200,000 publicly posted dating profiles, complete with pictures and information ranging from personality to political views. Then he poured that data into an open-source facial-recognition algorithm \u2014 a so-called deep neural network, built by researchers at Oxford University \u2014 and asked it to find correlations between people\u2019s faces and the information in their profiles. The algorithm failed to turn up much, until, on a lark, Kosinski turned its attention to sexual orientation. The results almost defied belief. In previous research, the best any human had done at guessing sexual orientation from a profile picture was about 60 percent \u2014 slightly better than a coin flip. Given five pictures of a man, the deep neural net could predict his sexuality with as much as 91 percent accuracy. For women, that figure was lower but still remarkable: 83 percent.It was Kosinski\u2019s own research, but when he tried to answer that question, he was reduced to a painstaking hunt for clues. At first, he tried covering up or exaggerating parts of faces, trying to see how those changes would affect the machine\u2019s predictions. Results were inconclusive. But Kosinski knew that women, in general, have bigger foreheads, thinner jaws and longer noses than men. So he had the computer spit out the 100 faces it deemed most likely to be gay or straight and averaged the proportions of each. It turned out that the faces of gay men exhibited slightly more \u201cfeminine\u201d proportions, on average, and that the converse was true for women. If this was accurate, it could support the idea that testosterone levels \u2014 already known to mold facial features \u2014 help mold sexuality as well.But it was impossible to say for sure. Other evidence seemed to suggest that the algorithms might also be picking up on culturally driven traits, like straight men wearing baseball hats more often. Or \u2014 crucially \u2014 they could have been picking up on elements of the photos that humans don\u2019t even recognize. \u201cHumans might have trouble detecting these tiny footprints that border on the infinitesimal,\u201d Kosinski says. \u201cComputers can do that very easily.\u201dIt has become commonplace to hear that machines, armed with machine learning, can outperform humans at decidedly human tasks, from playing Go to playing \u201cJeopardy!\u201d We assume that is because computers simply have more data-crunching power than our soggy three-pound brains. Kosinski\u2019s results suggested something stranger: that artificial intelligences often excel by developing whole new ways of seeing, or even thinking, that are inscrutable to us. It\u2019s a more profound version of what\u2019s often called the \u201cblack box\u201d problem \u2014 the inability to discern exactly what machines are doing when they\u2019re teaching themselves novel skills \u2014 and it has become a central concern in artificial-intelligence research. In many arenas, A.I. methods have advanced with startling speed; deep neural networks can now detect certain kinds of cancer as accurately as a human. But human doctors still have to make the decisions \u2014 and they won\u2019t trust an A.I. unless it can explain itself.This isn\u2019t merely a theoretical concern. In 2018, the European Union will begin enforcing a law requiring that any decision made by a machine be readily explainable, on penalty of fines that could cost companies like Google and Facebook billions of dollars. The law was written to be powerful and broad and fails to define what constitutes a satisfying explanation or how exactly those explanations are to be reached. It represents a rare case in which a law has managed to leap into a future that academics and tech companies are just beginning to devote concentrated effort to understanding. As researchers at Oxford dryly noted, the law \u201ccould require a complete overhaul of standard and widely used algorithmic techniques\u201d \u2014 techniques already permeating our everyday lives.Those techniques can seem inescapably alien to our own ways of thinking. Instead of certainty and cause, A.I. works off probability and correlation. And yet A.I. must nonetheless conform to the society we\u2019ve built \u2014 one in which decisions require explanations, whether in a court of law, in the way a business is run or in the advice our doctors give us. The disconnect between how we make decisions and how machines make them, and the fact that machines are making more and more decisions for us, has birthed a new push for transparency and a field of research called explainable A.I., or X.A.I. Its goal is to make machines able to account for the things they learn, in ways that we can understand. But that goal, of course, raises the fundamental question of whether the world a machine sees can be made to match our own.Machine learning isn\u2019t just one technique. It encompasses entire families of them, from \u201cboosted decision trees,\u201d which allow an algorithm to change the weighting it gives to each data point, to \u201crandom forests,\u201d which average together many thousands of randomly generated decision trees. The sheer proliferation of different techniques, none of them obviously better than the others, can leave researchers flummoxed over which one to choose. Many of the most powerful are bafflingly opaque; others evade understanding because they involve an avalanche of statistical probability. It can be almost impossible to peek inside the box and see what, exactly, is happening.Rich Caruana, an academic who works at Microsoft Research, has spent almost his entire career in the shadow of this problem. When he was earning his Ph.D at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1990s, his thesis adviser asked him and a group of others to train a neural net \u2014 a forerunner of the deep neural net \u2014 to help evaluate risks for patients with pneumonia. Between 10 and 11 percent of cases would be fatal; others would be less urgent, with some percentage of patients recovering just fine without a great deal of medical attention. The problem was figuring out which cases were which \u2014 a high-stakes question in, say, an emergency room, where doctors have to make quick decisions about what kind of care to offer. Of all the machine-learning techniques students applied to this question, Caruana\u2019s neural net was the most effective. But when someone on the staff of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center asked him if they should start using his algorithm, \u201cI said no,\u201d Caruana recalls. \u201cI said we don\u2019t understand what it does inside. I said I was afraid.\u201dThe problem was in the algorithm\u2019s design. Classical neural nets focus only on whether the prediction they gave is right or wrong, tweaking and weighing and recombining all available morsels of data into a tangled web of inferences that seems to get the job done. But some of these inferences could be terrifically wrong. Caruana was particularly concerned by something another graduate student noticed about the data they were handling: It seemed to show that asthmatics with pneumonia fared better than the typical patient. This correlation was real, but the data masked its true cause. Asthmatic patients who contract pneumonia are immediately flagged as dangerous cases; if they tended to fare better, it was because they got the best care the hospital could offer. A dumb algorithm, looking at this data, would have simply assumed asthma meant a patient was likely to get better \u2014 and thus concluded that they were in less need of urgent care.\u201cI knew I could probably fix the program for asthmatics,\u201d Caruana says. \u201cBut what else did the neural net learn that was equally wrong? It couldn\u2019t warn me about the unknown unknowns. That tension has bothered me since the 1990s.\u201dThe story of asthmatics with pneumonia eventually became a legendary allegory in the machine-learning community. Today, Caruana is one of perhaps a few dozen researchers in the United States dedicated to finding more transparent new approaches to machine learning. For the last six years, he has been creating a new model that combines a number of machine-learning techniques. The result is as accurate as his original neural network, and it can spit out charts that show how each individual variable \u2014 from asthma to age \u2014 is predictive of mortality risk, making it easier to see which ones exhibit particularly unusual behavior. Immediately, asthmatics are revealed as a far outlier. Other strange truths surface, too: For example, risk for people age 100 goes down suddenly. \u201cIf you made it to this round number of 100,\u201d Caruana says, \u201cit seemed as if the doctors were saying, \u2018Let\u2019s try to get you another year,\u2019 which might not happen if you\u2019re 93.\u201dCaruana may have brought clarity to his own project, but his solution only underscored the fact the explainability is a kaleidoscopic problem. The explanation a doctor needs from a machine isn\u2019t the same as the one a fighter pilot might need or the one an N.S.A. analyst sniffing out a financial fraud might need. Different details will matter, and different technical means will be needed for finding them. You couldn\u2019t, for example, simply use Caruana\u2019s techniques on facial data, because they don\u2019t apply to image recognition. There may, in other words, eventually have to be as many approaches to explainability as there are approaches to machine learning itself.The researchers in Gunning\u2019s group stepped confidently up to the white board, showing off new, more powerful ways to draw predictions from a machine and then visualize them. But the intelligence analyst evaluating their pitches, a woman who couldn\u2019t tell anyone in the room what she did or what tools she was using, waved it all away. Gunning remembers her as plainly dressed, middle-aged, typical of the countless government agents he had known who toiled thanklessly in critical jobs. \u201cNone of this solves my problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be able to visualize another recommendation. If I\u2019m going to sign off on a decision, I need to be able to justify it.\u201d She was issuing what amounted to a broadside. It wasn\u2019t just that a clever graph indicating the best choice wasn\u2019t the same as explaining why that choice was correct. The analyst was pointing to a legal and ethical motivation for explainability: Even if a machine made perfect decisions, a human would still have to take responsibility for them \u2014 and if the machine\u2019s rationale was beyond reckoning, that could never happen.Gunning, a grandfatherly military man whose buzz cut has survived his stints as a civilian, is a program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. He works in Darpa\u2019s shiny new midrise tower in downtown Alexandria, Va. \u2014 an office indistinguishable from the others nearby, except that the security guard out front will take away your cellphone and warn you that turning on the Wi-Fi on your laptop will make security personnel materialize within 30 seconds. Darpa managers like Gunning don\u2019t have permanent jobs; the expectation is that they serve four-year \u201ctours,\u201d dedicated to funding cutting-edge research along a single line of inquiry. When he found himself at the brainstorming session, Gunning had recently completed his second tour as a sort of Johnny Appleseed for A.I.: Starting in the 1990s, he has founded hundreds of projects, from the first application of machine-learning techniques to the internet, which presaged the first search engines, to the project that eventually spun off as Siri, Apple\u2019s voice-controlled assistant. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a dinosaur,\u201d he says with a smile.As of now, most of the military\u2019s practical applications of such technology involve performing enormous calculations beyond the reach of human patience, like predicting how to route supplies. But there are more ambitious applications on the horizon. One recent research program tried to use machine learning to sift through millions of video clips and internet messages in Yemen to detect cease-fire violations; if the machine does find something, it has to be able to describe what\u2019s worth paying attention to. Another pressing need is for drones flying on self-directed missions to be able to explain their limitations so that the humans commanding the drones know what the machines can \u2014 and cannot \u2014 be asked to do. Explainability has thus become a hurdle for a wealth of possible projects, and the Department of Defense has begun to turn its eye to the problem.After that brainstorming session, Gunning took the analyst\u2019s story back to Darpa and soon signed up for his third tour. As he flew across the country meeting with computer scientists to help design an overall strategy for tackling the problem of X.A.I., what became clear was that the field needed to collaborate more broadly and tackle grander problems. Computer science, having leapt beyond the bounds of considering purely technical problems, had to look further afield \u2014 to experts, like cognitive scientists, who study the ways humans and machines interact.This represents a full circle for Gunning, who began his career as a cognitive psychologist working on how to design better automated systems for fighter pilots. Later, he began working on what\u2019s now called \u201cold-fashioned A.I.\u201d \u2014 so-called expert systems in which machines were given voluminous lists of rules, then tasked with drawing conclusions by recombining those rules. None of those efforts was particularly successful, because it was impossible to give the computer a set of rules long enough, or flexible enough, to approximate the power of human reasoning. A.I.\u2019s current blossoming came only when researchers began inventing new techniques for letting machines find their own patterns in the data.Gunning\u2019s X.A.I. initiative, which kicked off this year, provides $75 million in funding to 12 new research programs; by the power of the purse strings, Gunning has refocused the energies of a significant part of the American A.I. research community. His hope is that by making these new A.I. methods accountable to the demands of human psychology, they will become both more useful and more powerful. \u201cThe real secret is finding a way to put labels on the concepts inside a deep neural net,\u201d he says. If the concepts inside can be labeled, then they can be used for reasoning \u2014 just like those expert systems were supposed to do in A.I.\u2019s first wave.To create a neural net that can reveal its inner workings, the researchers in Gunning\u2019s portfolio are pursuing a number of different paths. Some of these are technically ingenious \u2014 for example, designing new kinds of deep neural networks made up of smaller, more easily understood modules, which can fit together like Legos to accomplish complex tasks. Others involve psychological insight: One team at Rutgers is designing a deep neural network that, once it makes a decision, can then sift through its data set to find the example that best demonstrates why it made that decision. (The idea is partly inspired by psychological studies of real-life experts like firefighters, who don\u2019t clock in for a shift thinking, These are the 12 rules for fighting fires; when they see a fire before them, they compare it with ones they\u2019ve seen before and act accordingly.) Perhaps the most ambitious of the dozen different projects are those that seek to bolt new explanatory capabilities onto existing deep neural networks. Imagine giving your pet dog the power of speech, so that it might finally explain what\u2019s so interesting about squirrels. Or, as Trevor Darrell, a lead investigator on one of those teams, sums it up, \u201cThe solution to explainable A.I. is more A.I.\u201dFive years ago, Darrell and some colleagues had a novel idea for letting an A.I. teach itself how to describe the contents of a picture. First, they created two deep neural networks: one dedicated to image recognition and another to translating languages. Then they lashed these two together and fed them thousands of images that had captions attached to them. As the first network learned to recognize the objects in a picture, the second simply watched what was happening in the first, then learned to associate certain words with the activity it saw. Working together, the two networks could identify the features of each picture, then label them. Soon after, Darrell was presenting some different work to a group of computer scientists when someone in the audience raised a hand, complaining that the techniques he was describing would never be explainable. Darrell, without a second thought, said, Sure \u2014 but you could make it explainable by once again lashing two deep neural networks together, one to do the task and one to describe it.Darrell\u2019s previous work had piggybacked on pictures that were already captioned. What he was now proposing was creating a new data set and using it in a novel way. Let\u2019s say you had thousands of videos of baseball highlights. An image-recognition network could be trained to spot the players, the ball and everything happening on the field, but it wouldn\u2019t have the words to label what they were. But you might then create a new data set, in which volunteers had written sentences describing the contents of every video. Once combined, the two networks should then be able to answer queries like \u201cShow me all the double plays involving the Boston Red Sox\u201d \u2014 and could potentially show you what cues, like the logos on uniforms, it used to figure out who the Boston Red Sox are.Call it the Hamlet strategy: lending a deep neural network the power of internal monologue, so that it can narrate what\u2019s going on inside. But do the concepts that a network has taught itself align with the reality that humans are describing, when, for example, narrating a baseball highlight? Is the network recognizing the Boston Red Sox by their logo or by some other obscure signal, like \u201cmedian facial-hair distribution,\u201d that just happens to correlate with the Red Sox? Does it actually have the concept of \u201cBoston Red Sox\u201d or just some other strange thing that only the computer understands? It\u2019s an ontological question: Is the deep neural network really seeing a world that corresponds to our own?We human beings seem to be obsessed with black boxes: The highest compliment we give to technology is that it feels like magic. When the workings of a new technology is too obvious, too easy to explain, it can feel banal and uninteresting. But when I asked David Jensen \u2014 a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and one of the researchers being funded by Gunning \u2014 why X.A.I. had suddenly become a compelling topic for research, he sounded almost soulful: \u201cWe want people to make informed decisions about whether to trust autonomous systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019re depriving people of the ability to be fully independent human beings.\u201dFor many, this law seems frustratingly vague. Some legal scholars argue that it might be toothless in practice. Others claim that it will require the basic workings of Facebook and Google to change, lest they face penalties of 4 percent of their revenue. It remains to be seen whether complying with the law will mean a heap of fine print and an extra check box buried in a pop-up window, some new kind of warning-label system marking every machine-made decision or much more profound changes.If Google is one of the companies most endangered by this new scrutiny on A.I., it\u2019s also the company with the greatest wherewithal to lead the whole industry in solving the problem. Even among the company\u2019s astonishing roster of A.I. talent, one particular star is Chris Olah, who holds the title of research scientist \u2014 a title shared by Google\u2019s many ex-professors and Ph.D.s \u2014 without ever having completed more than a year of college. Olah has been working for the last couple of years on creating new ways to visualize the inner workings of a deep neural network. You might recall when Google created a hallucinatory tool called Deep Dream, which produced psychedelic distortions when you fed it an image and which went viral when people used it to create hallucinatory mash-ups like a doll covered in a pattern of doll eyes and a portrait of Vincent Van Gogh made up in places of bird beaks. Olah was one of many Google researchers on the team, led by Alex Mordvintsev, that worked on Deep Dream. It may have seemed like a folly, but it was actually a technical steppingstone.Olah speaks faster and faster as he sinks into an idea, and the words tumbled out of him almost too quickly to follow as he explained what he found so exciting about the work he was doing. \u201cThe truth is, it\u2019s really beautiful. There\u2019s some sense in which we don\u2019t know what it means to see. We don\u2019t understand how humans do it,\u201d he told me, hands gesturing furiously. \u201cWe want to understand something not just about neural nets but something deeper about reality.\u201d Olah\u2019s hope is that deep neural networks reflect something deeper about parsing data \u2014 that insights gleaned from them might in turn shed light on how our brains work.Watching him use the tool, I realized that it was exactly what the psychologist Michal Kosinski needed \u2014 a key to unlock what his deep neural network was seeing when it categorized profile pictures as gay or straight. Kosinski\u2019s most optimistic view of his research was that it represented a new kind of science in which machines could access truths that lay beyond human intuition. The problem was reducing what a computer knew into a single conclusion that a human could grasp and consider. He had painstakingly tested his data set by hand and found evidence that the computer might be discovering hormonal signals in facial structure. That evidence was still fragmentary. But with the tool that Olah showed me, or one like it, Kosinski might have been able to pull back the curtain on how his mysterious A.I. was working. It would be as obvious and intuitive as a picture the computer had drawn on its own.Cliff Kuang is a writer at large for Fast Company and the author of \u201cUser Friendly,\u201d which will be published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.Advertisement"}

Take a moment to appreciate it before you dig in.Or maybe they ordered it from a caterer. That\u2019s fine, we don\u2019t judge. As you give thanks for the bounty of this meal and the company you share it with, spend some time thinking about some of the scientific facts that made your meal possible. Biology. Chemistry. Physics. It\u2019s all there on your plate.Here are some things we\u2019ve learned about your Thanksgiving meal. If all else fails, these facts might make for nice conversation starters with that step-cousin you only see once a year.In 2016, scientists published new research showing that the Zapotec people living in what is now Mexico kept whole turkey eggs in their households as long ago as 400 to 500 A.D., using them for ritualistic purposes. The discovery pushed back the earliest known domestication of turkeys by 100 to 200 years.A turkey is shaped physically like a big round ball, and when you\u2019re roasting it the heat has to come in from the outside. That makes the inner parts of the turkey the last to become hot enough to kill dangerous bacteria; the U.S.D.A. recommends at least 165 degrees.But by the time the inner thighs get to that temperature, the breast is overcooked. And if the bird is stuffed, the stuffing may never get that hot, and at lower temperatures stuffing is a wonderful growth medium for bacteria.Cranberries are made red by pigments called anthocyanins. These compounds are a common source of red coloration in the plant kingdom, from fall foliage to raspberries, apples and cherries.But beets have something different going on.Their brilliant reds result from substances called betalains. Scientists recently reported that in their evolutionary history, beets figured out how to harness a surplus of an amino acid called tyrosine. This is the same substance that helps opium poppies produce their narcotic effect. But while most plants switch off the process that yields tyrosine, the beet keeps it going until it becomes such a beautiful shade of red. Get the full story on the chemistry that makes beets so red.Scientists found that when a brussels sprout plant detects eggs laid on its surface by a type of butterfly, it responds by manufacturing a chemical. That chemical sends a signal to parasitic wasps, sort of like a last-minute invitation to a Thanksgiving meal. The wasps lay their own eggs, which eat the growing butterflies, and the brussels sprouts are saved.Not that we\u2019re saying that digging into those delicious green orbs will attract wasps. Enjoy! Here\u2019s an overview about that and other surprising things that plants can do.Instead of the whipped topping, we\u2019ll offer you this fact: your dessert is the product of an evolutionary quirk that transpired some 100 million years ago.There\u2019s still some left.

{"Headline": "How Far Will Sean Hannity Go?", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "FeatureThe Fox News host is willing to defend Trump at all costs \u2014 and is reaching more than 13 million people a day.Supported byIn his morning call with his senior executive producer at Fox, Porter Berry, and his executive producer, Tiffany Fazio, he suggested a rewrite of the opening monologue, a six-to-seven-minute riff that he sees as the most important part of the show. On Twitter, he told the producers, he\u2019d noticed many liberals calling for increased gun control. He wanted to center his monologue on a theme he frequently returns to on Fox and on his syndicated daily radio show, which reaches approximately 13.5 million Americans: Why was it that liberals always used tragedies to further their own political ends? To make the segment really hum, he would need material to react to \u2014 Hannity\u2019s most effective segments are oppositional \u2014 and Berry and Fazio agreed to start digging.Until a few years ago, the staff of \u201cHannity,\u201d the top nightly cable show in the United States, shared news by text or email, but today, much of the collaborative work is handled via a Twitter account accessible to only the staff. \u201cIf I like something, I\u2019ll click Like, and if other producers like something, they\u2019ll click Like,\u201d Berry told me. The result is a \u201cpool of ideas\u201d \u2014 \u201c50, 60, 70 stories,\u201d in addition to articles Hannity himself has flagged for inclusion. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to pull it all together,\u201d Berry added. \u201cBuild that argument.\u201d Soon, a few top contenders had emerged, among them a Facebook comment from a CBS executive, Hayley Geftman-Gold, who wrote that she was \u201cnot even sympathetic\u201d because \u201ccountry-music fans often are Republican gun toters.\u201dAround 3 p.m., Hannity settled into his studio on one of the top floors of the iHeartRadio offices just north of Times Square. Hannity has been a talk-radio host for three decades \u2014 he has been on television a comparatively meager 23 years \u2014 and his posture was relaxed, his normally helmeted-for-TV hair swept into a hand-combed side part. He bickered amiably with his longtime executive producer, Lynda McLaughlin, and his young chief engineer, Jason Mosse, and when I took a seat behind McLaughlin, Hannity hissed into the talk-back channel, placing a finger over his lips: \u201cShhh, guys. That\u2019s a New York Times writer. Nobody be themselves.\u201dHannity later told me he had, over time, developed separate approaches for his radio and television shows. \u201cMy thoughts are the same: I\u2019m mad,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with television, I\u2019ve got the images to help me out. With radio, it\u2019s on me to paint the picture.\u201d He opened his Oct. 2 radio broadcast with police-scanner audio from Las Vegas, punctuated by the sound of a SWAT team using breach charges to enter the shooter\u2019s hotel room. When it ended, Hannity compared the officers to the first responders who had run toward the crumbling World Trade Center in 2001. \u201cIn this particular case,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got the same policemen that are regularly trashed by individuals, those same policemen standing outside the door where this madman is firing his weaponry.\u201dOn the other side of the glass of the studio booth, her legs hidden beneath an American-flag blanket, Lauren Scirocco, the associate producer, was screening potential callers. \u201cThe Sean Hannity Show\u201d receives more than 1,000 calls per line per minute, and Scirocco told me she has learned, with practice, to swiftly differentiate the cranks from the callers who might be able to engage with the host. She put a couple of callers on hold, adding notes to a computer program that Hannity could see from the booth: \u201cSadly, this will hurt respectable gun owners \u2014 Aaron from Cincinnati.\u201d \u201cHatred for these victims is sickening \u2014 Joe from Brooklyn.\u201dMcLaughlin glanced up at one of the three overhead TV screens \u2014 \u201cThey fired that [expletive] on CBS,\u201d she reported \u2014 before returning her focus to the dozen open tabs on her laptop screen. An article featured on The Drudge Report claimed that not long after the shooting, a Twitter user with the handle @TheResistANNce, who identified herself in her profile as a \u201cteacher, mother, sister, woman,\u201d said to \u201cpray that only trumptards died\u201d in the Las Vegas attack. McLaughlin copied the link and sent it on to Hannity.\u201cHere\u2019s where we\u2019re going to go next,\u201d Hannity told his listeners, his hands raised like a football referee calling a field goal. \u201cHow is it some people, when a tragedy like this happens, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s politicize this!\u2019 Oh, you\u2019ve got a lawyer for CBS who says, \u2018No sympathy for Vegas victims; they\u2019re probably Republicans.\u2019 You\u2019ve got \u2014 and social media can be beyond vicious \u2014 you know, leftists celebrating. We\u2019ve got copies of the tweets. I\u2019ll show you on TV tonight.\u201dA few hours later, I found Hannity in his greenroom at Fox News headquarters, dressed like a mismatched Ken doll: Up top, a suit jacket and shirt and tie, and down below, where the camera lens wouldn\u2019t find them, jeans and loafers. In the dim light, a heavy coating of foundation and blush gave his face a garish glow. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d he laughed, catching me staring. \u201cI don\u2019t like it either.\u201dAlong with Neil Cavuto and Jon Scott, Hannity is one of the last remaining members of the original 1996 Fox News lineup, and following the sexual-harassment scandals that led to the ouster of its chief executive, Roger Ailes, and the host Bill O\u2019Reilly, the network\u2019s prime-time offerings have largely been remade in Hannity\u2019s image. But because of his radio obligations, Hannity rarely spends much time at Fox, preferring to remain at the radio offices until the last possible moment so he can prepare for his TV show in silence. \u201cI come in to do TV, I do TV and I walk out,\u201d is how he put it to me. Office politics, he said, didn\u2019t interest him.\u201cHannity\u201d broadcasts from Studio J, a chasmal chamber that also serves as the backdrop to Dana Perino\u2019s new daytime show. Out on the floor, the techs were making their final preparations. \u201cTwo minutes!\u201d someone shouted. Hannity glanced at his phone \u2014 he\u2019d just received a text message from John Rich, a country star who performed at the concert in Las Vegas, and who would be interviewed by Hannity. \u201cHe\u2019s sending a video of when he honored the military,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cHave that loaded up and ready to roll?\u201dAt the 10-second mark, the techs froze in place. You could hear the hum of the stage lights, the squeak of the camera rigs. \u201cTonight, America in a state of shock after a madman opened fire on a country-music festival in Las Vegas,\u201d Hannity intoned.After a recap of the shooting, he moved into a clip of CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny pointing out that \u201ca lot of these country music supporters were likely Trump supporters.\u201d (Zeleny had been trying to explain that the shooting would affect a wide \u201ctapestry\u201d of Americans.) Next, there was an impassioned reading of the CBS executive\u2019s Facebook comment. Later, in an interview with the singer Kaya Jones, who also performed at the Las Vegas concert, Hannity paraphrased a portion of @TheResistANNce\u2019s tweet. \u201cWe deserve to get shot because we voted for Trump?\u201d Jones fumed via telefeed.\u201cWhere is your human soul to tweet that out?\u201d Hannity said.Hannity rarely grants interviews to mainstream reporters, whom he calls \u201cdisgustingly biased, ideological and corrupt.\u201d But he also suffers from a suspicion that his critics willfully misunderstand his motivations. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know what drives me, what energizes me,\u201d he told me. And in October, when I asked him to show me around his hometown, Franklin Square, on Long Island, he enthusiastically agreed, suggesting a pizzeria off Hempstead Turnpike.\u201cI realized early on that there\u2019s no other Sean Hannity than the one you see on television,\u201d Rivera told me. \u201cHe\u2019s a fire-breather who breathes fire all day and then sits down and has a drink.\u201d Rivera recalled the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape last year, in which Trump bragged of grabbing women by their genitals. At the time, many political commentators on the right were treating the video as fatal to Trump\u2019s presidential bid; a handful of party figures called on Trump to step aside and put his running mate, Mike Pence, on the top of the ticket. Hannity went in the opposite direction, allowing that what he called the \u201clocker room\u201d comments were wrong, but framing the tape as a politically motivated distraction. \u201cKing David had 500 concubines, for crying out loud!\u201d he joked to one panelist. Later, he suggested on Twitter that it was Bill Clinton who should be investigated for sexual misconduct.It was a pivotal moment for Hannity and for Trump, and it sealed the bond between the two men. \u201cIf you look back at those traumas,\u201d Rivera told me, \u201cyou\u2019ll see that Hannity steadied the whole of conservative politics during those crucial times. And I think he plays much the same role now. He\u2019s firm in his support of the president, and woe unto you if you don\u2019t see things the same way. He\u2019s a shield.\u201dHannity and Trump remain extraordinarily close and speak to each other regularly. President George W. Bush once called Hannity, too, \u201cbut Hannity\u2019s and Trump\u2019s personalities are much more in line,\u201d a friend of Hannity\u2019s told me, \u201cand they\u2019ve both come from the media world.\u201d In their conversations, the friend continued, Hannity served as sounding board: \u201cHannity\u2019s a numbers guy, Trump\u2019s a numbers guy. He thinks there\u2019s nothing worse than bad numbers, and he knows Hannity\u2019s got his finger on the pulse.\u201dHistorically, a chumminess between a president and a journalist isn\u2019t exactly unusual \u2014 in the early 1960s, the syndicated columnist Joe Alsop often defended his friend President Kennedy with a vehemence that struck many colleagues as unseemly. What makes the Hannity-Trump alliance so unusual, says Nicole Hemmer, a scholar of media history at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center, is the extent of Hannity\u2019s reach: \u201cHe\u2019s talking for four hours a day. He\u2019s got social media. He\u2019s empowered by his new status at Fox, this massive institution of Republican power.\u201dTo trace the arc of Hannity\u2019s career is to appreciate how deftly he has leveraged two concurrent trends \u2014 the rightward tack of the Republican Party and the expanding influence of conservative media \u2014 to become power broker, spokesman and arbiter of the Republican base. \u201cIf I\u2019m trying to figure out how to communicate to the American people,\u201d Hannity\u2019s longtime confidant Newt Gingrich told me, \u201cthere are very few people who have a better understanding of the broad base, a better intuitive understanding of the kind of folks who elected Trump. He at least matches or surpasses Rush [Limbaugh] in that understanding.\u201dIn our conversations, Hannity insisted that he hadn\u2019t changed at all; it was the Republicans who had left him. \u201cReagan talked about bold color differences, no pale pastels,\u201d he said, \u201cand I can\u2019t distinguish between the Republicans and the Democrats right now.\u201d Some Republicans, he argued, \u201cdeserve to lose.\u201dStephen K. Bannon, the former chief strategist for Trump, told me Hannity is \u201cthe single most important voice for the \u2018deplorables,\u2019\u2009\u201d as Trump backers often style themselves. But to his critics, Hannity\u2019s approach is at best dismaying and at worst emblematic of the corrosive, fact-free, \u201cat-any-costs\u201d partisanship that helped propel Donald Trump to power. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous stuff,\u201d Katie Packer Beeson, Mitt Romney\u2019s deputy campaign manager in 2012, told me. \u201cAnd I do worry that it might be a while before the pendulum swings back the other way.\u201dIn November, news broke that Roy Moore of Alabama, the far-right Republican Senate nominee, was said to have approached, dated or initiated sexual contact with several teenagers \u2014 one of whom was 14 \u2014 in the 1970s. As had been the case with the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, it was a crucial (and dangerous) moment for the populist wing of the Republican Party, and for days, Hannity tried to filter and refilter the allegations for his fans.Declaring that Moore should drop out of the race if the charges were true, Hannity nonetheless initially adopted a skeptical stance: \u201cHow do you tell?\u201d he asked on Nov. 9, the day The Washington Post published the first article detailing accusations against Moore. \u201cHow are we, the American people, to ascertain what is true and not true?\u201dOn the same program, McLaughlin, Hannity\u2019s executive producer, argued that at least some of the allegations involved consensual contact. \u201cConsensual, that\u2019s true,\u201d Hannity responded. A few hours later, after heated criticism on social media, Hannity told his viewers he\u2019d not been referring to the 14-year-old, who under Alabama law, would be incapable of consent. But in a panel discussion that followed, he prodded a legal analyst, Mercedes Colwin, to explain why a woman might make a false claim of assault.\u201cHave people lied to get money?\u201d he asked Colwin.\u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d Colwin said, and went on to argue that actual victims of sexual predators were \u201cvery few and far between.\u201dThe demand was straight out of the pro-wrestling playbook: the powerful impresario demanding his foe grovel to be spared. And sure enough, hours before Hannity\u2019s deadline, Moore, who had denied the allegations, argued for a stay of execution. \u201cDear Sean,\u201d he wrote in an open letter published on Twitter. \u201cI am suffering the same treatment other Republicans have had to endure.\u201d In the end, Hannity announced that he would leave the choice to the voters of Alabama. \u201cThey will make the best decision for their state,\u201d he said on Fox News. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be decided by me.\u201dAs Hemmer, the media scholar, pointed out, Hannity was backed into a corner of his own making. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know which way the wind is going to blow with Moore,\u201d she said, \u201cand Hannity\u2019s got advertising pressure and probably pressure from inside Fox. This was his way out of an impossible situation.\u201d I asked if she thought Hannity recognized he\u2019d crossed a line. \u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d she said, \u201cis that as long as the politics are moving in the right direction, the lines don\u2019t really exist.\u201dBoth Hugh and Lillian worked throughout Sean\u2019s childhood, Hugh as a family-court officer in the city and Lillian as a stenographer and a corrections officer at a county jail. In the evenings, there was a fug of Pall Mall smoke in the air and, occasionally, his mother\u2019s pistol sitting on the kitchen table. Hugh allowed Sean to take his first shooting lesson at 11, inspiring his love of guns; today, Hannity has a concealed-carry permit for his .40 Glock.Hannity\u2019s older sister Teddy Grisham remembers Lillian, with her halo of white hair, as the family taskmaster. But Hannity told me that \u201cwhen I got in trouble, my father ripped the belt off and kicked the [expletive] out of me.\u201d Still, he came to admire what he saw as Hugh\u2019s sense of right and wrong. \u201cIn many ways,\u201d he told me, \u201cI\u2019m not as good as him.\u201d I asked Hannity to describe himself as a kid. \u201cAn [expletive],\u201d he replied. \u201cHonest answer. Not on purpose. I just wasn\u2019t that interested in school. It bored me to tears.\u201d He clashed frequently with the nuns at Sacred Heart Seminary, and by high school, he was cutting class to smoke with his classmates.One recent afternoon, Hannity drove down the long, curving streets in Franklin Square that he once pedaled as a newspaper-delivery boy, past the park where he manned the concession stand. Recalling his job as a 17-year-old bartender, he told me that work gave him an outlet for his natural restlessness. \u201cI think in my life,\u201d he later said, \u201cI\u2019m just a worker bee.\u201dWe drew to a halt in front of Hannity\u2019s childhood home, on Oaks Drive. It had been 35 years since he was last inside. \u201cI\u2019ll knock if you will,\u201d he said.The current owner, Barbara Jenik, opened the door, an aggrieved Chihuahua vised into her armpit. \u201cSean Hannity?\u201d she yelped, squinting into the sun. \u201cI listen to your radio show all the time!\u201d She led us around the side of the house, where decades ago Hannity carved his name into the brick facade. The letters, scrawled in a child\u2019s hand, were still visible. Hannity shook his head disbelievingly. \u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d Jenik asked.In the kitchen, Jenik\u2019s teenage daughter was reading the newspaper. Hannity looked toward the den. \u201cMy parents\u2019 room was here, and my room was in the back,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019d listen to the radio. That was my obsession.\u201dLillian and Hugh, originally supporters of John F. Kennedy, had, in the manner of much of white working-class America, gradually shifted their allegiance to the Republican Party, but neither had any interest in talking politics at home. Radio was Hannity\u2019s tutor: From morning till night, he\u2019d tune into local right-wing talkers like Bob Grant and Barry Farber, progenitors of the hyperpoliticized style that Rush Limbaugh would perfect.Grant is today best remembered for his declaration, in 1991, that the United States was being taken over by \u201cmillions of subhumanoids, savages, who really would feel more at home careening along the sands of the Kalahari.\u201d He was adept at toggling between genteel patter, with guests he agreed with, and explosions of indignant fury, at those he didn\u2019t. In one memorable exchange from the late 1980s, he demanded to know the whereabouts of a caller who called him a \u201cbigot,\u201d roaring: \u201cI want to meet you to kill you, you skunk! Get off my phone!\u201dIn Hannity\u2019s youth, \u201cit was never, \u2018Turn off the television!\u2019\u2009\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was: \u2018Turn that blankety-blank radio off now! Turn it off!\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Fine,\u2019 and then my parents would leave, and I\u2019d put it back on.\u201dIn the 1980s, after two years of college at New York University and Adelphi University, Hannity and Grisham drove up to Rhode Island, where they opened a wallpaper and design business. Between jobs, he read the novels of Taylor Caldwell, a conservative writer and member of the John Birch Society. Man \u201cwas made for rude combat\u201d and \u201ccrude ferocity,\u201d Caldwell writes in the novel \u201cBright Flows the River,\u201d which Hannity, a martial-arts practitioner, cites as a favorite.In 1989, now living in Santa Barbara, Calif., Hannity began calling in to the local talk station, KTMS, to argue the merits of the Reaganite worldview he\u2019d absorbed from Grant and others. That fall, he applied for an unpaid position at KCSB, the radio station of the University of California, Santa Barbara. As a host, Hannity was quick to test boundaries, to jab at what he regarded as the liberal pieties of the student body. After just a few months on the air, he invited onto his program a Lutheran minister named Gene Antonio, who contended that the government was hiding the truth about the AIDS crisis. \u201cFirst of all, the rectum is designed to expel feces, not take in a penis, and so what happens is the body rebels against that,\u201d Antonio told Hannity, explaining his theory of why gay men were prone to various diseases.In a later broadcast, Hannity took a call from Jody May-Chang, the host of a KCSB show called \u201cGay and Lesbian Perspectives.\u201d Hannity asked if it was true that May-Chang had a child with another woman. It was, May-Chang said. Hannity shot back that he felt sorry for the kid. \u201cI think anyone that believes, anyone listening to this show that believes homosexuality is just a normal lifestyle has been brainwashed,\u201d Hannity concluded.Richard Flacks, then the station\u2019s faculty adviser, says that \u201cit was this specific moment when he deals with Jody that was something more than repulsive speech.\u201d After the studio took the young host off the air, Hannity contacted a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union and successfully petitioned the university for a second chance. Then, in an act of characteristic bravado, he called for a public apology and an extra hour on the air every day. He was turned down.Hannity told me his removal was \u201cdeserved\u201d; in retrospect, he said, his statements were \u201cignorant and embarrassing.\u201d His views on same-sex marriage, he stressed, were now \u201clibertarian,\u201d and he has gay friends. But it was the start of a pattern that would repeat throughout his radio and TV career: Poke, prod, provoke, step back and do it all over again. Bill Dunnavant, Hannity\u2019s boss at his first professional radio gig, in Huntsville, Ala., recalled turning on the radio one afternoon and hearing Hannity engaging in a contentious live interview with the madam of a Nevada brothel. Dunnavant told me he pulled over at the nearest pay phone. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever do that again!\u201d he shouted at Hannity. \u201cThis is a family station.\u201dHannity told me, \u201cYou know, the only way to be successful \u2014 it took me a little while to figure it out \u2014 is you\u2019ve got to be yourself on the radio.\u201d His ratings slowly improved, and in 1992, he accepted a job at WGST in Atlanta, one of the largest markets in the south. At WGST, he alternated condemnation of the White House-bound Bill Clinton, an early Hannity b\u00eate noire, with lighter fare, like a one-off April Fools\u2019 Day segment in which he prodded young callers to vow not to engage in premarital sex. He also began periodically traveling to New York to appear as a political commentator on daytime programs hosted by Phil Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael. The segments were short, but the camera liked Hannity\u2019s blocky features and his forceful delivery.In 1996, Hannity\u2019s agent, David Limbaugh, got word of a new cable network being funded by the Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch. Limbaugh had an inside line \u2014 the network\u2019s head, Roger Ailes, had helped start his brother Rush\u2019s television show. He suggested Hannity apply.A few hours later, Hannity was in Ailes\u2019s office in New York. Their conversation was short and straightforward: \u201cRoger goes, \u2018Great, you\u2019re going to do a debate show,\u2019\u2009\u201d Hannity remembers. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all it took. My life changed forever.\u201dFor his producer, Hannity proposed Bill Shine, whom he met while subbing in as a host on a short-lived cable network called NewsTalk Television. \u201cThe worst thing you can do to Sean Hannity,\u201d Shine told me, \u201cis remind him of his first day.\u201d Hannity was stiff and \u201cpetrified,\u201d in his own recollection, prone to tensing up in front of the camera. At one point, Hannity and Shine ran into each other in a parking garage on 48th Street, near the Fox headquarters. Shine asked Hannity if he thought the show would last five years. \u201cFive years would be great,\u201d Hannity said.In 1997, Hannity took a nighttime radio slot at WABC \u2014 the show went into national syndication the day before the 9/11 attacks \u2014 and learned to use the radio program as a workshop for television. On WABC, he could afford to float new ideas, test new lines of attack. By the next day, in time for the start of \u201cHannity & Colmes,\u201d the material had been sharpened and refined into talking points he could fire at his Fox audience. It was in this manner \u2014 percussively, repeatedly \u2014 that he helped bolster the case for an invasion of Iraq and chipped away at Republican support for a bipartisan 2007 path-to-citizenship bill that later perished in the United States Senate.When Colmes left \u201cHannity & Colmes\u201d in 2009, the program was rebranded as just \u201cHannity,\u201d and dressed up in American-flag-inspired graphics. Hannity credits Ailes for sticking with him long enough to see him prosper on television. The Fox C.E.O., Hannity told me, \u201cwas a father figure,\u201d and in 2016, Hannity vociferously defended his boss in the face of sexual-harassment allegations. (With Hannity, as with Trump, loyalty is paramount, and although he and the former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly have not always gotten along, \u201cHannity\u201d was O\u2019Reilly\u2019s first stop at the network after being fired from Fox this year in response to allegations of sexual harassment.)\u201cSean definitely led the \u2018Come on, guys, we can\u2019t let our boss go down\u2019 group,\u201d Geraldo Rivera told me. \u201cBut Sean is also the one who ultimately said to me, \u2018From what I\u2019ve seen and heard, some of the allegations are true.\u2019\u2009\u201d Hannity told me of Ailes: \u201cYou know, sometimes people are complicated in life, sometimes it\u2019s not black and white. Some of the most brilliant people I have met in my life \u2014 something I don\u2019t have to worry about; I consider myself pretty average \u2014 the most brilliant people, often their blessing can be their curse. Do I believe everything that was said? No. Do I think maybe some of it is true? Maybe.\u201d He added, \u201cBut if you assume for a second some of it was true, that\u2019s a side of him I never knew, never saw.\u201dHannity\u2019s overt backing of the Tea Party was not unique at Fox News. But he wasn\u2019t just backing the movement on air: He was also participating in fund-raising activities and allowing his image to be attached to promotional mailers for groups like the Tea Party Patriots, which was also an advertiser on his radio show. And occasionally he pushed into fringier terrain, as when in 2011 he aired a television interview with Trump, then toying with running for president the following year, during Trump\u2019s crusade to force President Obama to release his birth certificate. Obama, Trump said, \u201ccould have easily have come from Kenya, or someplace.\u201d\u201cThe issue could go away in a minute,\u201d Hannity interjected. \u201cJust show the certificate.\u201dAt least publicly, Ailes did not always seem comfortable with Hannity\u2019s association with the Tea Party, and in 2010, he forbade Hannity to tape his Fox show from the stage of a Tea Party fund-raiser in Ohio. (Hannity says he was unaware that the group had charged for tickets.) But according to a source at Fox News, Ailes\u2019s private reaction was considerably more measured: \u201cLook, Roger was smart \u2014 he knew how much money was being generated by the opinion-side guys versus the news-side guys.\u201d Hannity was called into Ailes\u2019s office and sent on his way with a promise not to involve the show in any future fund-raising gigs.The success of the Tea Party movement, Hannity told me recently, made him certain that if Obama-era Democratic rule were going to be toppled, it would not be with more establishment Republican politics. In 2015, after observing Mitt Romney\u2019s sound thumping in the previous presidential election, he decided to fly around the country to secure the first interview with Republican contenders, preferably immediately after each one announced. He chartered flights himself, spending almost a million dollars in travel expenses. He saw it as \u201can investment in the business.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d take friends, my staff, whatever,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019d always fill the seats.\u201d He gravitated early to the Tea Party favorite, Ted Cruz. \u201cBut then I\u2019d go to a Trump rally,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou only had to open your eyes and see the enthusiasm.\u201d\u201cA big part of how Trump gauges how things are going is how they play out on television in particular,\u201d a Trump campaign official told me. And long before he began his presidential bid in the lobby of Trump Tower in June 2015, Trump was a frequent viewer of \u201cHannity.\u201d \u201cFrom that first trip down the escalator at Trump Tower,\u201d the official went on, \u201cTrump was able to literally speak like he was on \u2018Hannity.\u2019\u2009\u201dAs the primaries gave way to the general election, Hannity and Trump\u2019s campaign staff were in touch on an almost-daily basis. \u201cOccasionally, we\u2019d talk on Sean\u2019s show knowing Trump was watching,\u201d Gingrich told me. \u201cThe two most effective ways of communicating with Trump are \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 and \u2018Hannity.\u2019\u2009\u201dJohn Gomez, Hannity\u2019s old friend, who traveled with him on several legs of his Republican primary tour, recalled that Hannity saw something of himself in the president. \u201cSean knows that there\u2019s nothing better in radio than that shocking moment, that moment that freezes you,\u201d Gomez told me. Trump did what other politicians wouldn\u2019t. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid to state a controversial point. That bugs Sean.\u201dBill Shine told me that when it came to the opinion side of the Fox News operation, Hannity was \u201cearly on, pretty [much] first\u201d when it came to vocal support of Trump. This put the host at odds with a sizable portion of the Fox News brass, along with Rupert Murdoch, who, according to Murdoch\u2019s biographer, Michael Wolff, had advised Ailes to \u201ctilt to anyone but Trump,\u201d even if that anyone was Hillary Clinton. The vehemently anti-Clinton Hannity was not about to let that happen. (Ailes, after leaving Fox News, later joined the Trump campaign as a debate adviser.)Hannity spoke directly to Trump during the campaign. \u201cI was a little bit of a liaison,\u201d he says, between the Trump camp and Fox News. In August 2015, Hannity\u2019s colleague Megyn Kelly asked Trump at a Fox News-sponsored debate to account for his derogatory comments about women. \u201cI say this just very objectively: I thought the question was patently unfair,\u201d Hannity told me. In \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain,\u201d his book on Bannon and Trump, the Bloomberg Businessweek correspondent Joshua Green writes that Trump phoned Hannity the weekend after the debate, threatening to boycott Fox. Shortly thereafter, he tweeted: \u201cRoger Ailes just called. He is a great guy & assures me that \u2018Trump\u2019 will be treated fairly on @FoxNews.\u201dThe problem for Fox News is that while Hannity has risen to become the top ratings-earner of the nightly lineup, he is also a figure prone to barreling headfirst into the murky territory between opinion and out-and-out conspiracy theorism. And Fox executives frequently have been forced to juggle advertiser discontent with the need to ensure that Hannity, does not leave for a rival network, like Sinclair Broadcast Group, a right-leaning owner of local TV stations.After Rich\u2019s family demanded an apology and a retraction from Fox News, Hannity stopped mentioning Rich on the air, and he declined to discuss the case directly with me. But he has also tweeted that he is still looking into the circumstances of Rich\u2019s death: \u201cOk TO BE CLEAR, I am closer to the TRUTH than ever. Not only am I not stopping, I am working harder. Updates when available.\u201d He visited Assange at the Ecuadorean embassy in London, and he told me that he has continued to exchange messages with Kim Dotcom, a New Zealand-based fugitive internet entrepreneur and another proponent of the Rich-as-D.N.C.-leaker story. \u201cThere is a much deeper story yet to be heard,\u201d he said.Hannity\u2019s intransigence is Trumpian in its effectiveness: By backing off on reporting on Fox News about Rich, but maintaining his contention that there \u201cis something going on,\u201d he is effectively having it both ways. At least until a killer is found, he will never have to admit he is wrong. And Trump will continue to be the beneficiary.\u201cWe have days we call \u2018keeping it real,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cAnd keeping it real is like this guy who\u2019s so big and so strong, and he\u2019s coming up to me all throughout an hour-and-15-minute session and putting me in chokeholds, seeing how I respond to a gun to my head. You know, how do I deal with blades? And then another day is pain day, and then literally you put out your arms, \u2018Boom, boom, boom.\u2019\u2009\u201d He mimed a hammer-punching motion against his forearm and stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s made me stronger than I\u2019ve ever been in my life.\u201dA waiter appeared with two more pints of beer. When he left, Hannity gestured toward him. \u201cI\u2019m no different to all the service businesses,\u201d he said. It was a theme he returned to frequently, his enduring fixation on consumer demand \u2014 what made people angry or happy, what turned them on or off. Hannity, who was recently inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame, told me he continues to pay for his own focus-group surveys of his radio and television shows: What he seems to fear more than anything else is the prospect of a fan picking up the remote.For now, he has little to worry about. During the Moore scandal, he ascended to the top of the cable-news ratings heap. In the weeks after our first meeting, I kept in close touch with Hannity by text. As John Gomez, Hannity\u2019s longtime friend, had warned me, Hannity appears to be constitutionally unable not to answer his phone, and the messages often arrived at night \u2014 \u201casleep at 11 p.m.?\u201d read one chiding text \u2014 or even on commercial breaks from his television show.Sometimes, Hannity would preview segments to me, offering the broad arguments that he would refine and repeat that night. \u201cRemember trump lost VA and NJ. No shock,\u201d he texted after Republican losses in races for governor in those states; that night on the air, he repeated the words almost verbatim. \u201cMassive boomerang coming back on Dems on Russia,\u201d he texted before a segment on the purported uranium deal; a few days later, Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s office announced it would consider appointing a special counsel to look into the supposed deal. The influence obviously thrilled him, as did the reactions it could provoke. \u201cI say it,\u201d he texted, \u201cand it\u2019s gone. Then liberals bubble and fizz and give off steam like Alka-Seltzer in water.\u201dIn October, Hannity flew to Middletown, Pa., to interview Trump in advance of a rally to gin up support for tax reform. Sitting inches from the president, Hannity covered the biggest issues of the day, serving as rudder and prompt \u2014 steering Trump gently to friendly terrain. The new tax cuts, Trump said, would be \u201cmassive\u201d; working-class Pennsylvanians were \u201cincredible\u201d; health care reform would be \u201cgreat\u201d; and Democratic policies were \u201cterrible,\u201d an adjective the president went on to apply to Colin Kaepernick, the education system and the urban crime rate.Hannity, smiling solicitously throughout, let the roar of the crowd stand in for his response.\u201cI will say this,\u201d Trump told his friend, before leaving the stage. \u201cYou have been so great. And I\u2019m very proud of you.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the terms of Sean Hannity\u2019s contract. It is not the case that he can leave Fox News with no notice.Matthew Shaer is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Franken Case Sets Off Debate Over Line Between Abuse and a Mistake", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A day after the latest in a dizzying series of sexual assault revelations enveloped Senator Al Franken and rattled the Capitol, politicians and comedians were left trying to assess the line between predatory behavior and an inexcusable mistake, as calls mounted for him to resign.But that did not diminish their zeal as they called on Mr. Franken to step down.By Friday evening, Mr. Franken had canceled a coming appearance at a book fair in Miami.\u201cI\u2019m just so upset about this atmosphere and good people being dragged into it,\u201d said Jane Curtin, a member of the original cast of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d with Mr. Franken from 1975 to 1980 who has been close with him since. \u201cIt\u2019s just like the red menace. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to be next.\u201dMs. Curtin said that in a comedy setting where women were at times not valued or dismissed because of their gender, Mr. Franken was a powerful ally who viewed female writers and comedians as his equal. But she was also among several who said they were disappointed by Mr. Franken\u2019s conduct and were struggling with the episode, which happened during his comedy career.\u201cI was surprised,\u201d Ms. Curtin said. \u201cIf he did that, that\u2019s really stupid, but I have never seen him in a situation where he has been sexually aggressive with anybody.\u201d\u201cBecause if he did this to somebody else, or if anybody else has stayed silent, or anybody else has been the victim of any kind of abuse, maybe they can speak out and feel like they can come forward in real time and not wait a decade or longer,\u201d she said.As Washington wrestled with how to categorize Mr. Franken\u2019s behavior, which was accompanied by a photo that showed him appearing to grope Ms. Tweeden as she slept on a military plane, even some ardent defenders of women\u2019s rights said the senator\u2019s offense was not so grievous as to require his resignation.\u201cThis is not a Harvey Weinstein situation,\u201d said Debra Katz, a civil rights lawyer who handles sexual harassment cases. \u201cHarvey Weinstein was a serial predator who used his power to put women in very vulnerable situations. He abused that power by sexually assaulting women. That\u2019s not what this is.\u201dMs. Katz also drew a distinction between Mr. Franken\u2019s role as a comedian and that of a senator.\u201cContext is relevant,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did not do this as a member of the U.S. Senate. He did this in his capacity of someone who was still functioning as an entertainer.\u201dVictoria Jackson, who also overlapped with Mr. Franken on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d said he did not have a history of acting in an inappropriate manner in that workplace, where humor was often bawdy. She remembered him telling her he was troubled she acted like \u201ca ditz\u201d in meetings when he knew she was smart, a comment that unsettled her but one that she ultimately did not feel was harassment.\u201cI have a lot of stories of sexually inappropriate things that have happened to me in my life from people in show business,\u201d Ms. Jackson, 58, said in an interview. \u201cAs far as Al Franken, he never said or did anything inappropriate to me the six years I was on \u2018Saturday Night Live.\u2019\u201dSeveral of Mr. Franken\u2019s former aides said that they believed Ms. Tweeden\u2019s accusation, but that her account did not match what they experienced on Capitol Hill. They expressed disappointment in his actions but defended his track record as a lawmaker who promoted women in his office and valued their opinions.\u201cHe\u2019s had unsavory jokes in the past that he\u2019s regretted,\u201d Ms. Volin Lehr said of Mr. Franken\u2019s comedy career. She said the photo published Thursday fell into that category, \u201cbut it is hard to see how this is comparable to the other incidents that women have brought forward in the recent past.\u201dThe senator may not have welcomed all of his defenders. An Ohio Supreme Court justice, who is running for governor as a Democrat, shared his sexual experiences with \u201capproximately 50 very attractive females\u201d as he tried to defend Mr. Franken.\u201cNow that the dogs of war are calling for the head of Senator Al Franken I believe it is time to speak up on behalf of all heterosexual males,\u201d the justice, Bill O\u2019Neill, wrote Friday on Facebook in a post that has since been removed. \u201cI am sooooo disappointed by this national feeding frenzy about sexual indiscretions decades ago.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Reynolds was riding in the front passenger\u2019s seat.The exchange between Mr. Castile and Officer Yanez started off routine, but turned tense after Mr. Castile said he was carrying a gun. Dash camera video showed Officer Yanez shouting at Mr. Castile not to reach for the weapon. The officer then unholstered his gun and fired several shots into the car, fatally striking Mr. Castile.The episode quickly gained national attention because Ms. Reynolds, Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend, began streaming the shooting\u2019s aftermath live on Facebook and challenging Officer Yanez\u2019s version of events. Ms. Reynolds said her boyfriend had meant no harm and was trying to comply with the officer\u2019s orders.Ms. Reynolds\u2019s video showed Mr. Castile bleeding through his T-shirt as Officer Yanez cursed and continued pointing his gun through the window.

{"Headline": "Cabernet Franc and the Finger Lakes: Made for Each Other", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesOver the course of the last decade or so, only one New York State region has been recognized for the world-class wines it has produced.No, it\u2019s not the North Fork of Long Island. That is often the first guess. Perhaps the North Fork\u2019s proximity to New York City and the Hamptons is the reason even those with just a tepid interest in wine know about it. Long Island has great potential, certainly, and it has some fine producers. But as a region it has yet to establish an identity for either quality or style.The region we\u2019re looking for is the Finger Lakes of New York in western New York State, where the nearest big cities are Rochester and Syracuse.It is not often in the United States that decisions about which grapes to plant are motivated more by sound viticultural reasons than by commercial concerns. Few marketers looking for a wine to tempt the masses would settle on riesling, a critically adored grape that has had difficulty achieving a clear identity with consumers, even, paradoxically, as it has become more popular in the United States.For the Finger Lakes, though, it was a sound decision. The critical acclaim for its rieslings has fed a growth in production and the arrival of new producers.By 2011, the last year for which New York kept records of grape acreage, riesling was by far the region\u2019s most planted of white vinifera grapes, the European species that accounts for all the familiar fine-wine grapes. Even so, the region still has many acres of hybrid and native American grapes, like Concord and Niagara, a legacy of its history both as a producer of cheap fortified wines and of small wineries that did the bulk of their business selling directly to visitors.Still, few regions in the world flourish with only one signature wine. For as long as riesling has prospered in the Finger Lakes, winemakers there have debated what its red counterpart ought to be.I\u2019ve had charming pinot noirs, made in a fresh, delicate style rather than with opulent fruit. I\u2019ve had intriguing teroldegos and blaufr\u00e4nkisches. Yet the most consistently good and distinctive reds I\u2019ve had from the Finger Lakes have been cabernet francs.In the last five years or so, I have seen more cabernet francs from the region. It has not been a lot \u2014 cab franc acreage accounts for less than a third of riesling acreage \u2014 but enough to notice.As with riesling, focusing on cab franc is not at all a marketing no-brainer. It\u2019s the other cabernet, the one without a clear identity and name recognition. The easy path is not necessarily the best path, as was true with riesling, so maybe cabernet franc, too, makes sense.As we tasted through the 20 bottles, a clear profile of Finger Lakes cabernet franc emerged. These wines were pale in color, savory and spicy, more than sweetly fruity. Indeed, the fruit flavor tended more toward the tart end of the spectrum, leavened with herbal and mineral touches.These wines spoke plainly of cool-climate viticulture, a phrase often bandied about by regions that have little claim to it. Yet it is a true description of conditions in the Finger Lakes, where alcohol levels only occasionally rise above 13 percent, compared with the 14 percent to 15 percent seen regularly in California. The best cabernet francs were light- to medium-bodied with almost delicate textures and lively acidity, the sort that would go especially well on the Thanksgiving table.\u201cPeople are looking for more food-friendly wines,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cCool-climate cabernet franc will appeal to those seeking mineral-driven, acid-driven, more firmly tannic wines.\u201dIt\u2019s certainly a lovely, desirable style, though perhaps not mainstream American yet.\u201cUp in Copake, a lot of people want something local,\u201d Christy said. \u201cBut they also want something that\u2019s big and rich, so it\u2019s a fine line.\u201dAs a sommelier, Thomas has tried to pique his customers\u2019 interest in NoMad\u2019s excellent selection of Finger Lakes wines.\u201cI used to say, \u2018Think of a lighter version of cabernet sauvignon,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow I say, \u2018A spicier version of pinot noir.\u2019 It\u2019s been more successful in terms of peoples\u2019 expectations.\u201dAlmost any of these bottles is an excellent value. None of our favorites cost more than $25.It\u2019s the kind of experimentation that suggests a serious exploration of the region\u2019s potential. It will only get better from here.Best Value: \u2605\u2605\u2605 Lakewood Vineyards Finger Lakes Cabernet Franc 2014 $18Fresh and crunchy, with savory, nuanced flavors of tart red fruit, flowers and herbs.\u2605\u2605\u2605 Schneider & Bieler Finger Lakes Cabernet Franc Le Breton 2015 $21Concentrated and dark, with well-balanced, lingering flavors of cranberries and herbs.\u2605\u2605\u2605 Inspire Moore Finger Lakes Cabernet Franc Wisdom 2014 $19Textured and saline, with flavors of tart and sweet red fruits and herbs.\u2605\u2605\u00bd Atwater Estate Finger Lakes Cabernet Franc North Block Six 2014 $17Tense and floral, with aromas and flavors of red fruits, herbs and a touch of oak.\u2605\u2605\u00bd Hermann J.

Mr. Mugabe, who will be 94 next year, is running for re-election despite his increasingly frail health.Ms. O\u2019Donovan was arrested on Friday at her home in Harare and charged with subverting the government and undermining the authority of \u2014 or insulting \u2014 the president. She faces up to 20 years in prison.But on Thursday, a high court judge in Harare granted bail to Ms. O\u2019Donovan and openly expressed skepticism of the charges against her.The judge, Clement Phiri, said that Ms. O\u2019Donovan had \u201cshowed that she has a plausible defense.\u201d He added that \u201cit appears, prima facie,\u201d that there was no evidence of a plot \u201cto overthrow the government.\u201dShe has surrendered her passport and was ordered not to leave the country. A trial date has yet to be set.Ms. O\u2019Donovan, of Martinsville, N.J., is a 2014 graduate of New York University\u2019s Gallatin School of Individualized Study and is a project coordinator for Magamba Network, which produces political satire and comedy. She lives in Harare, the Zimbabwean capital.Prosecutors said that, starting in February, Ms. O\u2019Donovan had \u201csystematically sought to incite political unrest through the expansion, development and use of a sophisticated network of social media platforms as well as running some Twitter accounts.\u201dMs. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s goal, prosecutors charged, was to \u201creplicate offline uprisings like what happened in Tunisia and Egypt\u201d in 2011.The @matigary account \u2014 which has accumulated a wide following, including among Zimbabwean journalists, for incisive posts about Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government \u2014 has continued to tweet since Ms. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s arrest.A social media campaign started by the organization under the hashtag #FreeMartha urges Zimbabweans to call for her release, and is being spread by local and international rights groups.David McGuire, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Harare, said it was \u201cmonitoring Martha\u2019s case very closely and our Consular Services team has been in frequent, direct contact with Martha since her arrest.\u201dThe arrest came as Zimbabwe\u2019s government, which last month established a cybersecurity ministry, is tightening its control over social media and its potential threat to Mr. Mugabe\u2019s 37-year rule.The crackdown has helped keep the nation\u2019s streets quiet this year. But as Mr. Mugabe prepares to run for another term, Ms. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s arrest indicates that the authorities are unlikely to tolerate even the slightest criticism of the aging leader.In an apparent display of strength, Mr. Mugabe had the airport in Harare, the nation\u2019s biggest, renamed for him on Thursday.In September, government officials described social media as a security threat, after false rumors about shortages in the nation\u2019s supermarkets caused panic buying and a spike in prices.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s longtime finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, was appointed the new cybersecurity minister last month. It is not known where \u2014 or whether \u2014 the ministry has a physical office.An earlier version of this article misidentified an anonymous web browser.

{"Headline": "Virtual Reality Companies Are Changing How Athletes See Practice", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStanford kicker Jet Toner drags his right foot on the ground, then taps it twice. He looks down at the football in front of him and visualizes a line extending to the white poles 40 yards ahead.Defensive players shake out their quads and bend into squats in front of him, their hamstrings screaming from the second practice of the day. Sweat darkens their practice jerseys. The holder crouches, pats the grass with two fingers \u2014 the \u201cgo ahead.\u201dToner wiggles his right shoulder and turns his right wrist a few times, as he always does before field goal attempts. He tilts forward in anticipation, his eyes locked on the football. He exhales, springs lightly onto his left foot, and then takes two bounding hops before swinging a locked, pointed foot just below the holder\u2019s fingers. He only narrowly avoids nailing his foot into the wall.This is Stanford\u2019s virtual reality training room: a little glass box above the locker room where a virtual reality headset \u2014 a foamy black box flanked by three limp elastic headbands \u2014 dangles midair, suspended by a thick black cord. A desktop computer displays VR footage simulations used by almost every player position. Toner picks a simulation, clicks \u201cPlay\u201d and slides goggles down his face. Instantly, high definition pixels surge out of the black vacuum. His flip-flops melt into cleats; his brain believes he is back at practice. He can pivot 180 degrees and watch Coach David Shaw making clipboard tallies, or look straight ahead and count a lineman\u2019s eyelashes.This training VR is not animated \u2014 it\u2019s real video.\u201cI was pretty blown away by how immersive it was,\u201d Toner says. \u201cI was hesitant it would be helpful. After using it I was like, \u2018Wow, this is a whole different angle that you just don\u2019t get when you\u2019re watching a typical film with your coach.\u2019\u201dSince 2015, sports virtual reality has expanded beyond college football to become the sparkly new training toy for professional programs in the N.F.L., N.H.L., N.B.A., M.L.B. and Japanese baseball leagues. The industry pioneers \u2014 EON Sports VR and STRIVR \u2014 both grew out of college football. Shaw was one of the first coaches to adopt STRIVR in 2015 and is now an investor.Toner kicks field goals on real-life fields while an unwieldy contraption \u2014 what appears to be six GoPros welded together into a 360 degree video camera \u2014 records by his shoulder. Then, Toner can relive kicks using a VR headset.As the N.C.A.A. and N.F.L. increasingly restrict the frequency of so-called hitting practices, virtual reality training is providing a contact-free way to keep players sharp.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons STRIVR was so successful to begin with, especially in college teams,\u201d says Shawnee Baughman, the company\u2019s product manager. \u201cI think the N.C.A.A. coaches are really excited to be able to use a tool that allows their players more practice without breaking practice regulation rules, fatiguing them or injuring them.\u201dFor all the industry enthusiasm, VR\u2019s record is rife with letdowns. Since the \u201990s, almost every round of virtual reality hype has disappointed. Unresolved issues of motion sickness, fuzzy graphics and clunky equipment sabotaged almost any sense of \u201creality.\u201d It simply wasn\u2019t cool enough for its price.Today, VR once again demands the tech world\u2019s attention, thanks to investments from Facebook, HTC, Valve and Samsung. Yet while VR costs are decreasing, it\u2019s still not easy on budgets. Adopting STRIVR costs between $50,000 and $150,000; EON Sports\u2019 products start at $5,000 and hit an undisclosed \u201cmuch more than that\u201d on the high end, according to chief executive Brendan Reilly. For pro sports programs, VR must prove more useful than a handful of interns or new weight room equipment.For quarterbacks, VR is a decision-making incubator \u2014 a playbook with moving X\u2019s and O\u2019s. Before quarterbacks press play, their teammates are frozen, as if they\u2019re in a personalized wax figure museum. A button clicks, and they bubble to life, jogging to predetermined positions. Quarterbacks train to spot defensive gaps and open receivers. Linemen train to spot blitzes, and safeties look for offensive tells.In bird\u2019s-eye game film, plays are simplified, and correct decisions appear obvious. In VR, each snap is a kaleidoscopic human puzzle, with every piece constantly shifting positions, glaring, deceiving.\u201cYou can only get so much out of a traditional sideline anymore,\u201d says Chas Petrone, Vanderbilt\u2019s director of football video services, who also manages Vanderbilt\u2019s sports VR. \u201cYou go down, you put the headset on and you\u2019re almost going up against the defense again. It\u2019s decreasing your reaction time and making you that much better on the field.\u201dThe brain\u2019s reflex center believes VR experience is real.\u201cIt\u2019s visualization times a million,\u201d says Conrad Ukropina, Toner\u2019s predecessor at Stanford. \u201cKicking is like golf. It\u2019s like bowling. You want everything to be unconscious and muscle memory. The magic is the extra edge you can get.\u201d\u201cIf we make it we win. If I miss it we lose,\u201d Ukropina recalls thinking. \u201cIt was as big as a kick can get.\u201d\u201cIt felt comfortable and looked familiar,\u201d Ukropina says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about it in the moment, but afterward I was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, it was literally identical.\u2019 It started conscious and moved into unconscious because I\u2019ve done it so many times.\u201dBut the potential for VR performance training extends beyond athletics to more mundane activities.In one simulation, it\u2019s 5 a.m. in a Walmart vegetable aisle. An older woman \u2014 an actress \u2014 peruses the green peppers. First-time users wander around the store aimlessly, their eyes darting from frail, translucent produce bags to plastic carts brimming with butternut squash. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re supposed to be looking for.\u201cThe problem is in the bottom row,\u201d Baughman, STRIVR\u2019s product manager, explains, her voice floating into the vacuum like a movie narrator\u2019s. The carrots and the celery are stacked too high, and no cold air can get to the bottom vegetables. Customers won\u2019t want moldy carrots. If Walmart employees are to pass this test, they must catch the mistake.In 10 years, virtual reality training could be everywhere \u2014 from kindergarten classrooms to NASA training centers.For some, it\u2019s underwhelming; the black-rimmed fantasy gear of childhood dreams has finally materialized, only to shave seconds off player reaction-times at a cost of thousands of dollars. Derek Belch, the chief executive of STRIVR, and Reilly recognize the need to find uses appealing to average people \u2014 the ones who could never hit a field goal in virtual reality, much less daily life.\u201cEight months ago, no one would have been asking whether this was a fad, because there was so much coolness about it,\u201d Reilly says. \u201cThen there was this \u2018Oh wait, once the hype wears off, why are we doing this? How can we measure real value?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Breaking News of a Texas Church Shooting Required Accuracy and Sympathy", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tranquillity of a Sunday afternoon in the newsroom was shattered earlier this week with an unconfirmed report of a shooting at a church in Texas.Just before 1 p.m., Dataminr, an online platform that scours Twitter for breaking news, alerted us with a \u201cFlash,\u201d the highest level of importance, regarding a tweet that read:PSA: Active shooter with 15 ppl down at the baptist church in Sutherland Springs down my road, be careful everybody\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0fI\u2019m the weekend editor on the Express Team, where breaking news is one of our primary missions. The tweet immediately seized our attention, but it proved difficult to confirm: It was a Sunday, and government offices were closed; the rural nature of the area made it challenging to find addresses for neighbors; and the police, at the moment, were offering no details.For eight minutes after the initial alert, there was not another tweet about Sutherland Springs or an active shooter. I started to get restless. Could this be a false alarm?Regardless, we started to cast a wide net. Zach Johnk, a senior staff editor, looked at the community on Google maps. There was not much to see: a couple of churches and gas stations, a Dollar General store. Maggie Astor and Christina Caron, both reporters, started to call the stores, local law enforcement, government officials and hospitals. Ms. Caron also checked public records for residents we could call, but reaching people in this rural community proved difficult.By about 1:15 p.m. a few more tweets had started trickling in, and I tweeted back to as many people as possible, asking them to please call me or Ms. Astor.Some news outlets, almost all of them citing social media posts, also reported there were \u201cnumerous\u201d dead and wounded. However, we needed someone in authority \u2014 a coroner, a police officer or someone from the sheriff\u2019s office \u2014 to confirm what happened. Accounts on Twitter were from people discussing the event, but they were not witnesses. The goal was to reach at least one official or one person with firsthand knowledge.Unofficial accounts in breaking news are almost always inaccurate, and social media can amplify the echo chamber of incorrect details. For instance, the early erroneous media reports of the massacre in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 \u2014 reports that falsely suggested there was a second shooter and an additional victim in Hoboken, N.J. \u2014 still resonate with me.Meanwhile, I could feel a pit in my gut as the minutes ticked by and we repeatedly called law enforcement agencies and other officials to no avail. Calls to local residents were also fruitless. Every time we hit a wall, we tried a new tack \u2014 and then another.Finally, through Twitter, I was able to reach someone close to the scene, Joseph Silva. He agreed to take some pictures of the emergency responders, email them to me and describe what he saw.We were at last able to post our first article about 3 p.m. and build on our reporting in several updates. And as time went on, the scale and horror of what happened came into sharper focus.The extent of the tragedy was driven home when I got a call from a parishioner, Sandy Ward. She was among several parishioners I found on a Facebook page for the church; I\u2019d left a message for her hours earlier.My interview with Ms. Ward was extraordinary. We\u2019d spoken for about five minutes before she told me that three of her grandchildren and a daughter-in-law had been shot. Her grandson, 5, was shot four times and was in surgery, she said. At the time of our conversation, she was still awaiting word on her other family members.I was struck by the unfailing politeness and consideration she showed by calling me back from a hospital at a time of great personal crisis. I wished her strength and healing. She asked for prayers.Maybe it was my adrenaline starting to ebb or maybe it was this up-close example of the enormous tragedy that befell a small Texas community \u2014 but at the end of the interview, I could feel my voice starting to crack.I got off the phone and took a moment to regain my composure. There was more work to do.I still have not had the heart to look for updates about her relatives.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hacks That Help: Using Tech to Fight Child Exploitation", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpending the weekend in front of a computer sounds like a nightmare, especially to people who already spend most of their week in front of a screen. Still, 100 engineers gathered in Manhattan for a weekend hackathon earlier this month.They traveled from around the country to work with Thorn, a nonprofit that uses technology to fight adolescent and child sexual exploitation. Founded in 2009 by Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher as the DNA Foundation, with a mission of combating trafficking, Thorn was renamed in 2012 after the couple split, and expanded its mission to better incorporate technology in the fight against trafficking.\u201cWe get to use our skills for good,\u201d said Federico Gomez Suarez, a program manager in operations at Microsoft. Mr. Gomez Suarez has been volunteering for Thorn, with support from Microsoft, for two years.His group project focuses on how to help authorities identify missing or exploited children that appear in escort ads. Creating a program to quickly sort through the tens of thousands of images as quickly as possible requires answering many questions.\u201cWe want to create a program that can quickly ask, \u2018Is this child in several ads? Does the ad have text? Are there other ads with similar text? If so, is it possible they were made by the same person?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gomez Suarez said.Thorn has software with the ability to search through text ads, but wants to be able to better search through images. Engineers and law enforcement agencies focus on information from the solicitation ads posted on sites like Night Shift, Erotic Monkey and Backpage.Thorn\u2019s team garnered insight, they said, from talking to child sex trafficking victims who had worked in prostitution, and from that, created their first tool, called Spotlight.\u201cSometimes kids were forced to write their own escort ads to sell themselves,\u201d said Julie Cordua, the C.E.O. of Thorn. \u201cWe wondered: Can you analyze the writing in an ad, and if you have a hundred ads and somewhere was one that was written by a child, could you raise that one to the surface by running algorithms on top of it to say, \u2018Which of these ads was written by a child?\u2019\u201d\u201cSpotlight condenses a lot of the information out there on sites like Backpage into a format that we can more easily use to identify people faster,\u201d Mr. Reveles said.The availability of this technology presents lots of questions. One obvious one: Can\u2019t authorities abuse the technology and use it to trace people they believe are guilty of crimes unrelated to sexual exploitation?Ms. Cordua said the technology the organization uses already exists in some capacity. However, no one has made the concentrated effort to use it to fight issues like human trafficking and child and adolescent sexual abuse, because there\u2019s no money there.\u201cIf your customer is a child in distress and trauma and you have the technology, you don\u2019t really have the incentive to use it,\u201d Ms. Cordua said. \u201cWhat we wanted was to change the game.\u201dThorn has repurposed and is working to improve the same natural-language processing tools companies use to advertise the shoes you were interested in a few days ago, and the restaurant whose menu you browsed the other night on Facebook. Additionally, Thorn uses network analysis, similar to tools used in terrorism or fraud cases.\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at escort ads and someone is being sold, you want to know \u2018Is that person alone or are they maybe part of a group of five being controlled by the same trafficker?\u201d Ms. Cordua said.Central to much of Thorn\u2019s work is research done by medical professionals who have worked with victims as well as offenders. From that research, Thorn has experimented with warnings that appear in search engines when people search for child sex content.The strategies can vary depending on the audience: There are differences between someone who abuses a child; someone who abuses a child, documents it and shares it online; and someone who is trading abuse content but has never abused a child.\u201cThose insights affect a lot of our messaging,\u201d Ms. Cordua said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a someone who is consuming abuse content but you haven\u2019t abused a child yet, I want to get to you and get you to stop before it gets worse.\u201dIt would be a misconception to think that law enforcement personnel can push a button and come up with people to arrest (yet).\u201cThe last 100 yards are always human, but what we\u2019re trying to do is make it faster to find these kids and really to find a needle in the haystack,\u201d Ms. Cordua said.Mr. Kutcher, who testified about trafficking before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this year, has spent a lot of time thinking about how to best combat the abuse of technology by traffickers.\u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet, one-size fits all solution,\u201d Mr. Kutcher said. \u201cYou create a tool that helps law enforcement solve one issue, but then you have to build another tool to deal with another issue.\u201dMr. Kutcher said Thorn is the most fulfilling of his more than 150 investments. \u201cThis is the one I\u2019m most proud of,\u201d he said.slide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s New Album Is a Love Letter to Optimism", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat comes after heartbreak? For Bj\u00f6rk, it\u2019s \u201ca love letter to enthusiasm and optimism,\u201d she said.But her new album, \u201cUtopia,\u201d prizes airiness: the breath that powers voices and flutes; the atmosphere where birds fly; structures and tempos that change freely rather than being locked to a beat. The album, due on Nov. 24, is the latest iteration of Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s career-long fascination with how nature and technology can interact.The 2016 election of Donald J. Trump only strengthened her determination to envision hope. \u201cIf optimism ever was like an emergency, it\u2019s now,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of moaning and becoming really angry, we need to actually come up with suggestions of what the world we want to live in, in the future, could be. This album is supposed to be like an idea, a suggestion, a proposal of the world we could live in.\u201dBj\u00f6rk\u2019s proposal involves \u201cthat feeling, post-Trump, when everything\u2019s gone horribly wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you escape to an island, and there\u2019s a lot of women there with children, and everybody\u2019s playing flutes, and everybody\u2019s naked, and there\u2019s all these plants you\u2019ve never seen before and all these birds you\u2019ve never heard before, and orchids, and it has that feeling of pioneering into a new world.\u201dBj\u00f6rk, 51, played a nearly finished version of the album for me during one of her brief stays in New York City this year, on a muggy day back in July. (She has since been to London, to her home in Iceland, and on tour to Moscow, Buenos Aires and Tbilisi, juggling concerts with her band, gigs as a disc jockey and curating Bj\u00f6rk Digital, a traveling exhibition of her virtual-reality videos, which she will expand with songs from \u201cUtopia.\u201d) That afternoon, she was outfitted in a multicolored dress with an asymmetrical cut. After playing through the album on her stereo, she conversed volubly about the music across her kitchen table, over cups of strong coffee.\u201cI started thinking about this album as a city in the clouds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have gravity. It\u2019s more like floating in the air.\u201dThe album concludes with \u201cFuture Forever,\u201d with shimmering chords and Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s voice floating above silences; she invokes a benign matriarchy. \u201cImagine a future and be in it/feel this incredible nurture, soak it in,\u201d she sings, then turns to tech advice. \u201cYour past is a loop \u2014 turn it off.\u201dBut when reading about Mr. Weinstein, she said, she was struck by \u201chow he used the media against the ladies.\u201d Stories had circulated at the time of filming that Bj\u00f6rk was \u201cdifficult\u201d on the set. But she said: \u201cI was very conscientious. I showed up for every shoot on time,\u201d until there was a dispute over control of her music.\u201cWhen I talked about this project with Lars, he always promised me I had full control of my music,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was turning up at dance rehearsals, and somebody else had been editing my music in a way that was totally musically wrong. And they would keep telling me, \u2018Oh, it belongs to us now, it\u2019s not yours.\u2019\u201cAfter two months of just turning up for every single thing, and really just accepting all the harassment and just becoming part of the whole \u2014 just keeping on doing what I was told, basically \u2014 I had one weekend where I stood up. I could stand up as a musician and say, \u2018I\u2019m not returning back to work on Monday unless I get full control of my music.\u2019 And that took one day. On Monday night, they said yes, and then on Tuesday, I returned to work.\u201dArca, who has also worked on tracks for Kanye West and the R&B singer Kelela, joined Bj\u00f6rk partway through the making of \u201cVulnicura,\u201d and went on to tour with her amid his own prolific solo efforts.While Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s many previous co-producers have been enlisted to help execute her ideas, \u201cUtopia\u201d is closer to a full partnership. \u201cWhat was different was that me and Alejandro were merging,\u201d Bj\u00f6rk said. \u201cWe felt like we could write 50 albums, because it was so fun. At first we were really surprised because the generational gap is pretty large between us, and then we figured out that philosophically, we share a lot of things. And there\u2019s an optimistic and a celebrational element in both of our music that we really like.\u201d\u201cWe were sending each other a thousand ideas \u2014 it was like playing games with someone,\u201d Bj\u00f6rk said. \u201cIt\u2019s so interesting to communicate on so many levels. I was telling him, when I was being a music nerd at the beginning of this album: \u2018If we are going to merge as two musicians, let\u2019s go out of the grid. Let\u2019s try to not do the normal song structure thing, but meet in a very instrumental way. Let\u2019s have freedom.\u2019\u201dBj\u00f6rk has often based an album on a particular sonic palette: strings for \u201cVulnicura,\u201d the human voice for \u201cMedulla,\u201d the angelic, staccato sounds of harps, celesta and music boxes for \u201cVespertine.\u201d For \u201cUtopia,\u201d Bj\u00f6rk turned to the flute, the instrument she played growing up. \u201cMy flute side has been dormant for a long time,\u201d she said.To record the music she had composed on her computer, Bj\u00f6rk gathered an ensemble of a dozen flutists, all women, for \u201cFlute Fridays\u201d in Reykjavik. \u201cI tried to get as many colors out of the flutes as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cI miked them differently. Sometimes I had 12 flutes, sometimes six. There was alto flute, bass flute, tenor flute. They\u2019re treated a lot, with a lot of effects, or they\u2019re really clean, with nothing on them.\u201cWe went between the churches in Reykjavik, trying to get the right sound,\u201d she added. \u201cPlus, I recorded a lot of the flutes in my cabin by the lake \u2014 trying to create this world where you have people hanging out in your living room, playing flutes and singing and making beats, but it\u2019s part of real life.\u201dHer new songs also take up the more immediate pleasures of music and burgeoning romance. In \u201cBlissing Me,\u201d she sings about \u201ctwo music nerds obsessing,\u201d falling in love by \u201csending each other MP3s.\u201d In \u201cCourtship,\u201d she looks into software-assisted dating. \u201cHe turned me down/I then downturned another/who then downturned her,\u201d she sings, over chords built from flutes, and bursts of sputtering percussion hinting distantly at techno.There\u2019s still some lingering resentment and sorrow in songs like the defiant \u201cSue Me\u201d and \u201cTabula Rasa,\u201d and broader thoughts of solace in \u201cLoss,\u201d an elegiac melody strafed by a frenetic beat. But Bj\u00f6rk wanted the album to look ahead. \u201c\u2018Vulnicura\u2019 was the end of a chapter, and this is the beginning of a new chapter,\u201d she said.\u201cYou go through different periods in your life. It would be really nice if we could just figure out one recipe that would work throughout our whole lives. But fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, most things don\u2019t last long, and you have to rethink things, whether it\u2019s practical or emotional or spiritual or whatever level it has to be.\u201cIn the beginning of each period, you have to dream. You have to say, \u2018Oh, I want \u2026,\u2019 and it might at the beginning sound very utopian. But then if half of it becomes real, that\u2019s pretty good going. But you have to come up with, OK, what do I want to do next?\u201dAs the summer interview wound down, the afternoon suddenly darkened; there was a rumble of thunder, and a heavy downpour began. Bj\u00f6rk smiled to hear it. \u201cAll the tension has broken,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article included an erroneous transcription of part of an interview with Bj\u00f6rk. She described thinking about her new album as \"a city in the clouds,\u201d not \u201cgraffiti in the clouds.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some demanded that politicians put their differences aside to focus on what matters: repairs. Others questioned whether decision makers even ride the subway. Some were stunned to learn how much M.T.A. workers make. And others called on fellow straphangers to react \u2014 and act.A sample of what readers in New York and elsewhere are saying:Lawmakers Need to \u2018Work Together\u2019\u201cGovernor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio should be forced to ride the subways together, preferably while handcuffed and holding hands, until the New York City subway system\u2019s on-time performance meets or surpasses the standards set by other American subway systems.\u201d\u2014 William Ryall, 66, West Harlem\u201cQuit bickering and work together to repair and replace hazardous conditions before something horrific occurs.\u201d\u2014 Barbara Woodin, 76, West Chester, Pa.\u201cAll elected officials should be required to ride the subway or take the buses, especially those who have any input toward the budgets \u2014 the mayor, the governor, and the M.T.A. board. Stop fighting over who\u2019s in charge and do something.\u201dM.T.A. Workers Make How Much?\u201cThe M.T.A. system is a disgrace. Meanwhile we learn that M.T.A. administrators are making $280,000 (really?) and average workers are pulling in $170,000, while millions are being diverted to everything but maintenance and upkeep, track and signal upgrades, safety, and cleanliness. It\u2019s almost criminal.\u201d\u2014 John Keene, 52, Jersey City\u201cMr. Samuelsen rejected the idea that subway workers were overpaid, arguing that it is a dangerous job in which assault is common. As a primary care sub-specialist physician, I am unlikely ever to earn this type of salary.

{"Headline": "Instead of Making Turkey, They Make Reservations", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFlip through the folder where you store images of Thanksgiving meals gathered from movies, food magazines and Norman Rockwell illustrations. You will notice that wine lists are missing from the tables, lavishly set though they are, and the cast of characters, though extensive, does not include any bussers or sommeliers.A preponderance of the evidence, musical and otherwise, suggests that there\u2019s no place like home for the holidays. This does not seem to bother the thousands who make reservations instead of mashed potatoes. In fact, it seems to give them the quiet joy that comes from figuring out something that the rest of the country hasn\u2019t.What they know has something to do with what restaurants can be relied on to provide and what they can\u2019t. On Valentine\u2019s Day, a customer with a long-term horizon may expect a restaurant to create the conditions under which agreeing to get married seems like a terrific idea. One with a more immediate outlook may hope that the truffles and chocolate cake will directly result in a night of unprecedented sex.The Thanksgiving customer\u2019s goals, by contrast, tend to be easier for restaurants to achieve. Questioned closely, people who\u2019ve made a tradition of eating out on that day reveal that they like it because somebody else does all the planning. And the shopping. And the cooking. They like having a choice of main courses. And when the last drumstick has been picked clean, they like knowing that somebody else will wash all the dishes.This may sound familiar, and indeed it should. These are the very advantages that lure us to restaurants on any other day of the year. But no other day seems to require so much planning, shopping and cooking, or to leave so many gravy-streaked dishes in its wake.The first time somebody eats out on Thanksgiving, the reason is usually something other than laziness. That comes later. In the beginning, it may be because offers to join somebody else\u2019s family meal were unappealing or nonexistent.\u201cWhen we moved here, we didn\u2019t have family around,\u201d said Rhonda Le Grice, who settled in Atlantic Highlands, N.J., with her husband and son almost 30 years ago. \u201cWe\u2019d pitifully say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just the three of us \u2026 \u2019 but we didn\u2019t get too many invitations.\u201dShe also found that her young son, who had refused to eat turkey since he was a baby, could order something else. Typically, Thanksgiving menus have a fixed price and revolve around the standard dishes. Almost all, though, offer a choice of main courses for the turkey skeptics, who are legion.At 5 on Thanksgiving morning, the cooks file in. If the pies and bread don\u2019t arrive before the police close the streets for the Thanksgiving Day parade, somebody will have to meet the delivery truck. One server will spend the day covering for co-workers on their 30-minute breaks. The staff meal, served buffet-style in the bar, will feed 70 employees. The first of about 700 customers will be seated just after 1 p.m. and the last around 8 p.m.Bonnie Jenkins, the general manager, has worked 20 Thanksgivings at Keens. In her view, because the logistics have been honed over the years, the dining rooms are filled with something resembling tranquillity.\u201cThe restaurant has a little different feel to it,\u201d Ms. Jenkins said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have that same New York buzz: rraaahwr, rraaahwr.\u201d She made a noise like a toddler running over a plastic dinosaur with a Tonka truck. \u201cIt\u2019s more \u2018La la-la, la la-la\u2019,\u201d she sang, and this time she sounded like a child directing a small choir of stuffed unicorns.Those la la-las may also be attributable to another factor: the civilizing effect of restaurants. Thanksgiving can be a time when relatives express their mutual affection. Or it can be a time when long-simmering resentments, feuds and political differences spill over like the filling in an apple pie.The presence of other families in restaurants seems to act as a guardrail, keeping the dinner conversation from careening into a ditch.Even families for whom arguments at the table are as routine as saltshakers seem to appreciate a little restraint. The family of Fran Kessler, who worked for many years as an assistant to the editors of New York and Esquire magazines, gave up on a home-cooked Thanksgiving after the infamous year one of her younger relatives nicknamed the undercooked main course \u201cturkey carpaccio.\u201dMs. Kessler is active in Democratic politics and has strong views that can cause friction with her Republican relatives. \u201cIn our family, we fight over everything,\u201d she said. \u201cBut maybe we don\u2019t yell at each other as loud in a restaurant as we would at home.\u201dLarge, squabbling tables are less common on Thanksgiving, though, than two-tops \u2014 couples without children, taking advantage of their freedom and escaping a home-cooked meal. Restaurants are also a haven for people who are, by default or design, alone on the holiday. Gotham Bar and Grill sets places at its long bar for solo diners, and if they don\u2019t want to eat the whole, formidable menu, Mr. Portale lets them order \u00e0 la carte.There is, however, one disadvantage mentioned by almost everybody who eats out on Thanksgiving.\u201cYou avail yourself of the best chefs with every possible component of the dinner, you can sleep in, you can watch the parade, you can watch the dog show,\u201d Ms. Viney said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you the one thing you miss.\u201dAs good as they were in other respects, she said, the restaurants never sent her home with leftovers.Advertisement"}

So in 2015, she created a list of 100 black vegans for a website. It included pioneering figures like Dick Gregory and Coretta Scott King and younger, less famous writers, filmmakers, cooks and activists.Many people who give up eating animal products do it for their health, or for animal welfare. The same is true for the new veganism among African-Americans, but there is an added layer of another kind of politics.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about I want to eat well so I can live long and be skinny,\u201d said Jenn\u00e9 Claiborne, a personal chef and cooking teacher who recently moved to Los Angeles from New York. Her first cookbook, \u201cSweet Potato Soul,\u201d is due out in February. \u201cFor a lot of black people, it\u2019s also the social justice and food access. The food we have been eating for decades and decades and has been killing us.\u201dMs. Claiborne, 30, is part of a new generation of vegan cooks who are transforming traditional soul food dishes, digging deeper into the West African roots of Southern cooking and infusing new recipes with the tastes of the Caribbean.As a result, ideas about the dull vegan stews and stir-fries that were standard-bearers among the early generations of black vegan cooks are changing \u2014 albeit slowly.\u201cSome folks are kind of stuck in the \u201970s,\u201d said Jessica B. Harris, 69, an author and a food scholar of the African diaspora. \u201cTheir food seems to come with a dashiki.

But it pales in comparison to what a new batch of black vegan cooks are doing. \u201cI cook like someone\u2019s grandma,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really excited about are some of the younger chefs who are professionally trained and know how to put food together in a new way.\u201dOne of them is Ms. Claiborne, who grew up in suburban Atlanta and moved to New York after college to pursue an acting career. Her father was raised vegan, according to Hebrew Israelite beliefs, and still eats that way 90 percent of the time, she said. She grew up eating everything but red meat, and learned to cook soul food at her grandmother\u2019s side.She adds butternut squash to sweet potato pie to create the texture usually contributed by eggs. Oyster mushrooms stand in for shrimp in Creole \u00e9touff\u00e9e.

{"Headline": "Could a Democrat Actually Win the Alabama Senate Race?", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Democratic victory in an Alabama Senate race would rank as one of the most improbable, astonishing outcomes in the last few years of improbable, astonishing political events. So, yes, this could happen.The Roy Moore-Doug Jones contest can be seen as a mad experiment to test the limits of Republican strength in Alabama, perhaps the toughest for Democrats in the country. It might be reasonable to say that if Democrats can\u2019t win it here and now, they just can\u2019t win it as long as the country remains so divided by race, religion and education.A Republican defeat in Alabama would jeopardize the party\u2019s Senate majority in the midterms in 2018. Democrats need a net gain of three seats to take the chamber, but in 2018 they have only two good opportunities, in Arizona and Nevada, and must defend 10 seats in states that voted for Donald J. Trump. A Democratic victory in Alabama would hand the party that third, tough-to-find state even before the beginning of the cycle. It is probably far too soon to get a good sense of where the race will end up, especially since it is not clear whether a write-in candidate will enter the race. Recent polls have not been of the highest quality, but they suggest a tight race. There\u2019s a simple reason Mr. Moore is still very competitive: Alabama is just that conservative.Alabama voted for Mr. Trump by 28 percentage points in 2016, but even this doesn\u2019t do justice to the Republican strength there. The state is deeply polarized by race. Hillary Clinton probably didn\u2019t win even 15 percent of white Alabama voters last year. Black voters represent a quarter of the electorate, and made up around two-thirds of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 34 percent statewide vote share.It\u2019s tough enough to carry a state where your party\u2019s presidential candidate lost by 28 points. It\u2019s about one-third harder if you\u2019ve already maximized your vote share among a quarter of the electorate. In part for that reason, Alabama\u2019s election results are among the most stable in the country. Since 1984, Alabama has swung less between presidential elections than any other state, moving an average of just 4.8 points from the prior presidential result. Alabama also has the third-lowest average share of third-party votes in the country in presidential elections since 1980, which may be a rough measure of the strength of partisan allegiances. A reason that Alabama might be tougher still for Democrats is that its staunchly conservative white voters are particularly tough to persuade. White evangelical Christians represent about half of Alabama\u2019s electorate, according to exit polls, and more than 90 percent of them probably supported Mr. Trump. It\u2019s not easy to come up with recent favorable precedents for Democratic victories in the Deep South. Perhaps the best involves David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican who managed to lose the governor\u2019s race by 12 points in 2015. Mr. Obama lost Louisiana by 17 points in 2012. Mr. Vitter was dogged by a prostitution scandal from nearly a decade earlier.Another promising precedent for Democrats happens to be Mr. Moore himself. He won by only four points in his 2012 campaign for Alabama chief justice, and that was without the sexual harassment allegations that have shaken his current Senate campaign. It was the worst performance by an Alabama Republican running for statewide office since 2008.Black voters represented a larger share of the election in both of these contests than they have in the post-Obama era, so one might assume that Democrats would fare a couple of points worse with today\u2019s turnout patterns. But Republicans can take hope because neither of these precedents was a federal election. That makes a big difference. Historically, the relationship between governors\u2019 election results and presidential vote choice is quite weak relative to federal elections and presidential vote choice. Democrats also ran more moderate candidates in those races. John Bel Edwards, now governor of Louisiana, ran against Mr. Vitter as a pro-gun, anti-abortion Democrat. Mr. Moore\u2019s 2012 opponent, the circuit court judge Bob Vance, consistently characterized himself as a moderate without taking positions on hot-button issues. Whether Mr. Moore will have the resources necessary to appeal to Alabama\u2019s deep conservatism is an open question. Even if he does, it\u2019s possible that the allegations against him are just bad enough to ensure defeat.But if Mr. Moore does have the money and the opening to make the case that Mr. Jones is too liberal, I wouldn\u2019t count him out.Advertisement"}

(\u201cOur podcast friends could fill that stadium.\u201d)Maybe he wasn\u2019t kidding.Primero y Diez began as a blog in 2008, run by Harada and a friend, and has mushroomed into four podcasts, with a paid staff of 12 and, it says, 1.5 million visits to its programs monthly during the football season.Primero y Diez has grown in sync with Mexican interest in the N.F.L., accelerated by the regular-season game here last season \u2014 the first in Mexico City in 11 years \u2014 and by a matchup Sunday between the New England Patriots and Oakland Raiders at the city\u2019s famed Estadio Azteca, with another game planned for next year.The leagues are finding that these big events carry a cachet that Mexicans, regardless of their level of interest in the sport, are willing to pay for.\u201cThere is a social effect, and one of not wanting to miss the big event in the city,\u201d said Rodrigo Latorre, an independent sports marketing analyst. \u201cIn that regard, a lot of attendance is guaranteed.\u201dBoth N.F.L. games, in a stadium with a capacity of 72,000 for American football, sold out in less than an hour. The average price was $95.On Primero y Diez programs, the complicated discussions and debate that occur in the United States \u2014 over concussions, domestic violence, racial protests by players and whether the sport is in decline \u2014 take a back seat to full-throated dissections of Philip Rivers\u2019s floating passes, and Blake Bortles\u2019s interceptions, and whether the Rams \u201ccan play with the big boys of the N.F.C.\u201d\u201cHere in Mexico they like sports, but they don\u2019t like to talk about what surrounds sports,\u201d said Harada, 32, who worked in public relations and sports journalism before beginning the site to satisfy his own demand for saturated N.F.L. news and commentary.\u201cPeople were looking for information to place their bets,\u201d said Andres Ornelas, 34, who does a betting podcast for the site. \u201cThey said it\u2019s how they pay their rent.\u201dA loose vibe prevails in the cramped, rented booth where the podcasts are recorded. A cardboard cutout of Raiders quarterback Derek Carr loomed over the hosts last week, and during one taping they sipped cold beer while riffing on the weekend\u2019s games.\u201cThere is great quality in their content with a lot of different elements that give great, additional value,\u201d said Eric Arriaga, a 34-year-old government lawyer who follows the podcasts. \u201cAll their work is unique and original.\u201dThe N.F.L. is betting on a future of long-term economic growth in Mexico to expand the middle class and lure more sponsors; further develop a growing fan base (the league\u2019s surveys put it at upward of 10 million self-described hard-core fans); and increase sales of merchandise, as well as television and media rights.In a typical week, nine games are aired in Mexico City, two on broadcast television and the others on cable \u2014 in some cases more than what is available in most American cities. As in the United States, ratings have slipped \u201cin the single digits,\u201d said Arturo Olive, the N.F.L.\u2019s point person in Mexico.Most analysts believe that security and logistical hurdles make putting a permanent team here largely a fantasy. The city\u2019s smog and elevation of about 7,500 feet are enough of a challenge that extra oxygen tanks will be on hand for the players this weekend.But the league reaps benefits in business deals around the visits. Olive said the game on Sunday would turn a profit for the league, but he declined to elaborate.The N.F.L. decided to resume regular-season games here after Estadio Azteca, a showcase venue for soccer, was remodeled last year for its 50th anniversary, adding two locker rooms suitable for professional football teams and internet and communications upgrades expressly to lure back the N.F.L.The Patriots and the Raiders are two of the most popular teams in Mexico. The Cowboys and the Steelers lead the pack, since their games were the first to be broadcast in the country in the 1970s. When fans are encountered here, they tend to be rabid about the sport.\u201cWhat I would tell you is the level of knowledge that fans have of the game, the Xs and Os, the sophistication, is as strong as it is in the U.S.,\u201d said Mark Waller, the N.F.L.\u2019s chief international executive. \u201cWhen you become the fan of a sport in another country, almost by definition you become more knowledgeable because you have to force yourself to learn it.\u201dThe young men behind Primero y Diez exemplify that.Their site is housed in an incubator for tech start-ups in a hip neighborhood, buzzing with well-educated 20- and 30-somethings like themselves.Jorge Tinajero, 41, a computer engineer who is another founder of the site, traces his passion for the sport to a family tradition of football, in his case a father who played at a college in Mexico.Tinajero played touch football as a boy and remembers getting hooked for good while watching John Elway in the Super Bowl against the Giants.\u201cAnd then I started suffering every two or three years like die-hard Broncos fans,\u201d he said.Carlos Gorozpe, 31, a social network and website consultant and a commentator on Primero y Diez, said he had never caught the soccer bug, instead inheriting a fondness for the Buffalo Bills from an uncle mad about the team and about college football here and in the United States.\u201cAs a kid, I woke up to watch bowl games,\u201d he said.Primero y Diez receives news media credentials from the N.F.L. \u2014 and Harada writes occasional pieces in Spanish for the Steelers\u2019 website \u2014 but it otherwise is not affiliated with the league, which Harada said he preferred.\u201cI like the idea of independence, I have so many ideas,\u201d he said.This week, Primero y Diez has been in its element. It has published a magazine on the Patriots-Raiders game, filled with statistical breakdowns, player snapshots, a history of the stadium. And it was planning live shows on Facebook in the days leading up to the game.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the Raiders are going to do to deter the offense of the Patriots,\u201d Tinajero said.Harada settled on a prediction: Raiders over the Patriots, 31-28.It surely did not come out of thin air.Ken Belson contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Smash that like!Men under 65 may suffer from all kinds of things. The problem isn\u2019t only erectile dysfunction, for which Hims offers sildenafil (the generic name of Viagra, $20 per month); there\u2019s also the sensitive issue of hair loss, for which Hims offers finasteride (the generic form of Propecia, $28.50 per month).Both are pharmaceutical drugs requiring prescriptions, which Hims offers via its staff of five staff physicians making diagnoses via online consultation, whose fees are included in the service\u2019s prices. Prescriptions can be filled through Hims\u2019 own network of pharmacy partners, or sent to patients\u2019 current pharmacies for pickup. (Hims, which does not accept insurance, serves 18 states in the U.S.)The site also sells over-the-counter options like minoxidil (known to older people as Rogaine), DHT-blocking shampoo said to promote hair growth, gummy biotin vitamins, and, coming soon, skin care and more.Its models (some nonmodels, Mr. Dudum said) are young, handsome, tattooed and multiethnic, many found and photographed in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. The palette, site and packaging design is coolly minimal: millennial pink gone masculennial beige.\u201cWhen you look at the brand, at the tone, it\u2019s incredibly casual,\u201d Mr. Dudum said. \u201cThere\u2019s run-on sentences. Punctuation\u2019s in the wrong place. It\u2019s meant to be said out loud. We need to talk to guys as if we\u2019re that older cousin, the uncle at the family barbecue who says, \u2018Dude, why are you balding right now?\u2019\u201dRegarding the look of previous marketing and branding efforts, Mr. Sperduti said, \u201cWhat came to your mind first was what came to all of our minds. We just kind of started listing out all the things we knew we wanted to be diametrically opposed to.\u201dMr. Dudum declined to share specifics about sales, but the millions raised in funding suggest backers confident in the prospect of direct-to-consumer telemedical health. (Mr. Dudum is also a founder and general partner of Atomic, a venture capital fund.) In any case, Mr. Dudum said, the response has already outstripped expectations.\u201cWe have reordered everything, when we didn\u2019t think we were going to have to do that for months,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are pretty far out exceeding every number we thought was possible by a pretty large sum. We\u2019re just shocked at the amount of people coming in.\u201d The market is likely to only grow when erectile dysfunction drugs like Cialis go off-patent, which could happen as early as September 2018.At Roman, which addresses itself specifically to erectile dysfunction, response has also been strong. Roman offers several prescription drugs (sildenafil \u2014 both generic and Viagra \u2014 Cialis and Levitra) and acts as a conduit between physicians and customers, rather than employing its own doctors, although it does operate its own pharmacy, where its participating doctors can send prescriptions for fulfillment. (Roman refers to this as a \u201ccloud pharmacy.\u201d) Prices range from $2 to $63 per pill, plus $15 for the medical consultation.Those prescriptions may also be sent to any pharmacy, but at Roman\u2019s own, you can get your packages delivered in a plain brown box, with doses portioned into single-serve packets for wallet- and pocket-friendliness.\u201cWhen you think of a Roman man, you think of this shredded guy on a pedestal ready for battle,\u201d said Mr. Reitano, the former entrepreneur in residence at the venture firm Prehype. \u201cWe wanted to redefine what that actually means. What that means to us is someone who tackles their health head on. Not the \u2018rub some dirt on it, walk it off\u2019 mentality that people are brought up with. While that might work for a charley horse, it doesn\u2019t enable you to be the best partner to your significant other, and it doesn\u2019t enable you to stay around as long for your children.\u201dPart of the appeal of Roman and Hims is the ability to sidestep a potentially awkward face-to-face conversation with a doctor, one of the boons of the emerging field of telemedicine. The potential downside, of course, is misdiagnosis or abuse, as Dr. Steven Lamm, the director of the Tisch Center for Men\u2019s Health at N.Y.U. Langone, and a medical adviser to Roman, acknowledged.\u201cErectile dysfunction is often a barometer of a man\u2019s health,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a potential for it really to be a reflection of vascular disease. You want to be certain you have the right screening procedures to rule out the person who is inappropriate to be put on this. I think the companies that are going to be initiating this field understand that. They\u2019d have to be idiots not to.\u201dHowever, he said, he was bullish on the prospect, as Roman may bring men unaccustomed to regular doctor\u2019s visits into the medical fold. (Roman offers an incentive for men to visit their own physician after their diagnosis, in the form of a rebate.)\u201cThe bottom line, we\u2019ve always known that the area of sexual medicine is a common entrance into the health care system,\u201d Dr. Lamm said. \u201cMen generally wait until things are broken before they go to the doctor.\u201dWith phone in hand, the doctor is in, and solutions are at hand. For an erection lasting longer than four hours, slide into their DMs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Facebook\u2019s Oracular Algorithm Determines the Fates of Start-Ups", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "FeatureThe platform is so good at \u201cmicrotargeting\u201d that many small e-commerce companies barely even bother advertising anywhere else.Supported byOne night in the summer of 2015, over Sichuan at Han Dynasty on 85th Street, Cogan asked Horwitz for advice about his latest notion: selling contact lenses online. The contacts business was dominated by a handful of companies like Johnson & Johnson and Bausch & Lomb, which seemed to charge whatever they wanted \u2014 at least in Cogan\u2019s view, based on the price increases for his own lenses. Surely a low-cost competitor could tempt away customers. Cogan pulled his laptop from his bag and opened it at the table in the middle of dinner, pushing aside plates of dumplings and scallion pancakes. He had two plans to show Horwitz. They could sell a cheap disposable lens to doctors. Or they could mimic Cogan\u2019s employer, a wildly successful start-up called Harry\u2019s.By late 2015, Harry\u2019s, which sold safety razors and shaving cream, was in the vanguard of upstart online retailers known as direct-to-consumer companies. The business model works like this: Firms sell only their own products, only through their own websites. By cutting out retailers and distributors, they can charge less for their specialty products than entrenched competitors. That year, Casper, then a direct-to-consumer mattress and bedding seller, was reported to be on track to exceed $100 million in sales in its second year of business. Dollar Shave Club, another seller of razors, had reached $152 million in revenue. Warby Parker, the eyeglasses purveyor that many credit with pioneering this business model in 2010, had recently closed an investment round that reportedly valued the company at $1.2 billion. Venture capitalists \u2014 convinced that consumers would increasingly patronize specialty online retailers as they grew more comfortable shopping online \u2014 were pouring money into direct-to-consumer start-ups, more than $2 billion over the past four years, according to CB Insights.Horwitz, by now bored in his job, pushed Cogan to keep pursuing his idea and volunteered to help him do research. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to intellectualize whether an idea is good or not,\u201d Horwitz says. \u201cYou have to just start doing it and see.\u201dBy February 2016, after many nights and weekends of emailing Asian manufacturers and reading up on Food and Drug Administration compliance, the vision of a viable business was coming into focus. The pair had found an F.D.A.-approved manufacturer in Asia and figured out how to meet the necessary regulations. Still, Cogan was reluctant. He had been accepted to Wharton and had even put down a deposit. He believed that was the smarter option. At best, the contact-lens business would become a side project.Before shelving their venture, they decided to try one more tack. They recruited two friends: Paul Rodgers, a buddy of Horwitz\u2019s from Columbia who knew how to write computer code, and Dan Rosen, a friend of Cogan\u2019s from Bronx Science who was handy with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Together the four built what is known in the world of online retailing as a demand experiment. The technique, credited to Harry\u2019s founders (who give away its basic code), amounts to a two-page website. The first page explained the concept of a monthly subscription for contacts and asked those who were interested to submit their email addresses. Visitors who did so were taken to a second page and were made an offer: Share this referral code with friends, and if enough of them sign up, you\u2019ll get free contacts.They posted a link to their site on the walls of about 40 Facebook friends. Within a few days, not only had their own friends signed up, but friends of friends of friends had, too \u2014 some 2,000 people in all. Some of those distant connections were even evangelizing the company on their own Facebook walls. \u201cIt went mini-viral,\u201d Cogan says.He and Horwitz applied to tech incubators \u2014 organizations that invest in and coach young companies in exchange for minority stakes \u2014 using the demand experiment as one slide in their 16-page PowerPoint presentation. They pitched a few venture capitalists based in New York as well. They decided that if they were admitted to an incubator, they would work on the project full time. If not, Cogan would go to Wharton. By April, they had not only been called back for interviews with five incubators; venture funds were also offering to invest a total of $3.5 million in their idea.Cogan dropped his Wharton plans. He and Horwitz ordered 50,000 contact lenses and, with Rosen as creative director and Rodgers as chief technology officer, began working out of their investors\u2019 offices, stacking boxes and boxes of lenses along the walls by their desks. They eventually named their enterprise Hubble, after the orbiting telescope that can see into deep space.Facebook helped them succeed with their demand test; now it would generate their first sales. During the summer of 2016, a friend of one of Hubble\u2019s prospective investors, a start-up veteran named Joshua Liberson, recommended that the founders try a new type of Facebook advertising called Lead Ads. No outside website was needed: Would-be customers simply clicked a button on the ad to submit their email addresses, directly from Facebook. Hubble directed its ads to ZIP codes in New York and Chicago, where they had already signed up optometrists willing to write prescriptions. After people clicked the ads, Horwitz emailed them to coordinate appointments and take their orders.When Hubble\u2019s online store opened officially on Nov. 1, 2016, Cogan and Horwitz knew how to run a Facebook advertising campaign, and they were confident it would continue to generate sales. They planned to spend the additional $3.7 million they raised almost entirely on Facebook ads.In considering Facebook\u2019s far-reaching influence, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind the perspective of the more than five million advertisers whose money is financing the social network\u2019s rampant growth. For them, Facebook and Instagram, which the company also owns, are the stuff of fantasy \u2014 grand bazaars on a scale never seen before. By advertising directly in users\u2019 news feeds, companies can, at any time of day, target potential customers at moments when they are often bored and open to novelty. What better time to hear a product pitch?\u201cFacebook created the world\u2019s greatest infomercial,\u201d says Roger McNamee, a founder of Elevation Partners, who invested early in Facebook but has since become critical of the company\u2019s influence. \u201cIt\u2019s really inexpensive to produce ads and unbelievably inexpensive to reach exactly the market that you\u2019re looking for.\u201d As a result, Facebook has become especially lucrative for companies trying to sell new products online. The leaders of more than half a dozen new online retailers all told me they spent the greatest portion of their ad money on Facebook and Instagram.\u201cIn the start-up-industrial complex, it\u2019s like a systematic transfer of money\u201d from venture-capital firms to start-ups to Facebook, says Charlie Mulligan, the founder of BrewPublik, which uses a \u201cBeergorithm\u201d to deliver personalized selections of craft beers to customers every month. At 500 Startups, the tech incubator based in Silicon Valley that funded BrewPublik, Facebook advertising is a topic covered in classes. In fact, social-network advertising is an assumed prerequisite for anyone studying marketing at a tech incubator these days \u2014 or at any business school across the country. \u201cThere is a formula for this stuff,\u201d Mulligan says. \u201cAnd the reason why there is a formula is because it works.\u201dThe process is easy, cheap and effective. With a few hundred dollars and a morning\u2019s effort, an entrepreneur can place his or her ads before social-media users that same afternoon. Companies unsure which ads are best can upload a handful of them and let Facebook\u2019s artificial-intelligence software test their efficacy. If they don\u2019t know who should see their ads, they can embed code on their websites that enables Facebook to monitor the traffic and then show ads to recent visitors. Or companies can send the email addresses of their existing customers to Facebook, and it will locate their Facebook accounts and put ads in front of so-called Lookalikes, users who like and click on the same things that your proven fan base does. It\u2019s all about as straightforward as setting up an online dating profile. Steph Korey, a founder of Away, a luggage company based in New York that opened in 2015, says that when the company was starting, it made $5 for every $1 it spent on Facebook Lookalike ads.The ease of opening a business on Facebook has in turn spawned a wild proliferation of specialty digital sellers that depend on the social network\u2019s algorithm to find their early customers. Many of them follow the same playbook and even share a similar aesthetic. They spend money on traditional public relations, on sponsored links that appear next to Google search results and on \u201cinfluencer\u201d marketing, or giving away their product to people with large social-media followings, in hopes of creating buzz. Then they buy ads on Facebook and Instagram. Inevitably you will encounter them there: They feature a sleek photograph or a video loop of a product \u2014 a wood-handled water filter, woolen shoes, an electric toothbrush. At the top, in bold, the company\u2019s name appears, often ringing with the same friendly, typically two-syllable whimsy. Soma. Allbirds. Goby.\u201cSometimes we\u2019ll look at each other and say, \u2018God, there are just so many of them,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Ellie Wheeler, a partner at the venture fund Greycroft Partners, which invested in Hubble last year. Her firm has also taken ownership stakes in Thrive Market, which sells health foods; Plated, a meal-kit delivery service; Trunk Club, which mails a box of clothes to its customers; and Eloquii, a fast-fashion retailer specializing in plus sizes.While not all of these companies and others like them will survive, plenty are encroaching on established brands, which are taking the threat seriously. In July 2016, Unilever, the European consumer-products conglomerate, acquired Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1 billion. In June, Walmart agreed to buy Bonobos, an internet-based apparel brand, for $310 million. Companies that sell products exclusively online continue to grow faster than any other type of retailer in the United States \u2014 some 17 percent annually since 2011, more than six times the rate of retail over all, according to Euromonitor International.And Facebook has even been taking steps to influence offline sales, in order to bring traditional retailers into its orbit. In September, the social network introduced a tool that lets businesses with physical stores show ads to shoppers and their Lookalikes even if they visit the store but don\u2019t buy anything. Day by day, Facebook is extending its reach further and further into the American marketplace.The basic building block of Facebook advertising is an ad set. It consists of the ads themselves and choices in three other categories: audience, goal and budget. That day, Rosen was designing a set to reach an audience of people on Instagram who had visited hubblecontacts.com in the past 30 days. His goal was \u201cconversions,\u201d or persuading users who had seen the company\u2019s ad to make a purchase. Finally, he set a budget of $1,000 per day. He uploaded the three images. Now they were ready to be tested, to see if any of them were winners in the eyes of users and the algorithm.This detailed handicapping process involves thousands of advertisers per auction. Millions of auctions take place every minute as users across Facebook load their feeds. The process is never the same twice. The algorithm is constantly learning, using past results to inform how it weighs bids in the next auction. The intent, Facebook says, is to maximize value for everybody: to pair the advertiser with its likeliest customers, and to show ads that users want to see. And, of course, to make money for Facebook.But from Rosen\u2019s perspective, nothing much had happened before he ambled into the office a little after 10 a.m. Facebook had spent a grand total of $1.86 on his ads. It had shown the first ad to 51 people, the second to 45 and the third to only two. The first ad had been clicked once. Rosen, unperturbed, poured himself a cup of coffee from the single-serve machine. The algorithm takes a little while to get warmed up, he said. \u201cIn an hour, it\u2019ll get exciting.\u201dTwenty minutes later, Rosen refreshed his browser. The Ads Manager window displayed the latest numbers: Rosen could see only the results, not the process that produced them, but it seemed as if the click had inspired the algorithm to favor the first ad. During those 20 minutes, the first ad appeared before 76 more people \u2014 that is, it won 76 more auctions than the other two ads. Over the next hour, the algorithm showed the first ad, which featured a photo of colorful Hubble boxes against a blue background, to more and more users; the algorithm had begun to favor it, apparently. As Rosen refreshed his browser, the sensation was like watching a seed sprout. The ad got more views. Some led to clicks. And eventually, sometime between 11:28 a.m. and 11:53 a.m., one of those clicks led to the test\u2019s first sale. Commerce was in bloom.The moment felt odd. Obviously there was science behind the scenes; the algorithm was a set of rules written by Facebook engineers. But from where Rosen sat, the operation might as well have been run by the Holy Spirit. Facebook\u2019s artificial-intelligence algorithm had wound its way through the server farms, reached out among two billion users, found an individual and showed her a Hubble ad on Instagram \u2014 and she used her credit card to buy a subscription for contact lenses.In quick succession, the first ad generated two more sales. The algorithm started increasing how much it bid on Hubble\u2019s behalf, thus winning even more auctions for ad space and spending more of Hubble\u2019s money on it \u2014 first $1 a minute, then $2 a minute, then more than $3. By 2 p.m., Facebook\u2019s A.I. had charged Hubble $306.50 to put that ad in front of 9,684 users. The second ad, after an outlay of $8.03, had been all but abandoned. And the third ad was hardly given a chance: Since 8 a.m., it had appeared before only 30 people.\u201cNo idea why,\u201d Rosen said, shaking his head. Rosen could see all sorts of data arranged in neat rows on Facebook\u2019s Ads Manager program: the number of views, clicks, sales and the average cost, in advertising, of acquiring each new customer. But none of the metrics at Rosen\u2019s fingertips could resolve a fundamental mystery: why the algorithm behaved as it did, why it preferred some ads over others and why the third ad got little attention whatsoever.The morning\u2019s ads were incredibly similar: \u201chubblecontacts,\u201d the company\u2019s Instagram handle, appeared at the top, above pictures of boxes in peach, blue, yellow and green. The only differences were that the first ad showed the boxes of contact lenses lined up against a blue background; in the second and third ads, they were set against a split pink-and-blue background and were arranged diagonally in the second and scattershot in the third. But they were all just boxes! Did Instagram users really prefer contact-lens ads with strict rows of boxes or blue backgrounds? Had rules been written into the algorithm favoring orderly arrangements? (The Hubble team knew Facebook favored certain aesthetics.) To what extent was the day\u2019s outcome, apparently set in motion when the first ad happened to get that first click in the morning, actually random? Rosen could only guess.In the early 2010s, direct-to-consumer companies showboated. But lacking the money for big TV ad campaigns, they relied instead on old-fashioned public relations, panache and luck. Warby Parker hired a public-relations firm to pitch its concept to Vogue and GQ and debuted its website on the same day issues reached subscribers. It also held an event featuring bespectacled models at the New York Public Library during Fashion Week. Dollar Shave Club first succeeded on account of the exquisite timing, both commercial and comedic, of its founder, Michael Dubin. He made a funny, low-budget video introducing his company, then uploaded it to YouTube on the same day TechCrunch reported Dollar Shave Club\u2019s first round of venture funding. Within days, after some immediate attention at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., Dubin had three million views online.Facebook\u2019s sales pitch \u2014 putting the right ad in front of the right person, thanks to the wonders of data technology \u2014 isn\u2019t exactly new. As far back as 1964, William Allan, a business editor for The Pittsburgh Press, reported that in the near future, \u201ccomputers will tell businessmen which half of their advertising budgets are being wasted.\u201d Thirty years later, The Economist described an effort to take advantage of American Express\u2019s transactional records: \u201cPowerful data-crunching computers known as massive parallel processors, equipped with neural-network software (which searches, like the human brain, for patterns in a mass of data), hold out a vision of marketing nirvana.\u201d Companies like Acxiom, Experian and Datalogix have been offering similar data-mining services to direct marketers for years. What sets Facebook (and Google) apart are scale and sophistication.A recent study by a Princeton professor, Arvind Narayanan, and a doctoral candidate, Steven Englehardt, provides a sense of how thoroughly the two online giants monitor user behavior. In early 2016, they examined the top one million websites in the world, using special bots they developed to scour them for tracking mechanisms. Google had trackers on 76 percent of these sites, Facebook on 23 percent of them. (Twitter, in third place, had trackers on just over 12 percent of the sites.) The tech giants can examine all this data looking for patterns and then match them back to prospective customers.What also sets Facebook and Google apart from their direct-marketing forebears is that they give access to everyday advertisers. Anyone with a credit card can go online and test ads on Facebook\u2019s platform, one of the most sophisticated direct-marketing operations ever. But while average people can use the machine, there\u2019s still a lot of mystery about how it works. The methods and calculations of the algorithm \u2014 why it ends up pushing some ads and not others \u2014 are all hidden.Almost as soon as they began, Rosen, Horwitz and the others at Hubble became determined to fathom the algorithm\u2019s secrets \u2014 to figure out why some ads succeeded and others didn\u2019t. Soon they were trading hypotheses with other entrepreneurs, cribbing ideas from other companies\u2019 ads and taking a formal approach to testing, rooted in the scientific method. They uploaded ads with identical images but different wordings, for example. The Hubble team wound up concluding all sorts of things. Ads with third-party endorsements \u2014 from GQ, say, or BuzzFeed \u2014 beat those with their own slogans. Ads featuring close-ups of the Hubble boxes outperformed those with human models. Ads that included a button that said \u201cShop Now\u201d or \u201cLearn More\u201d fared worse than an ad with no button at all; viewers simply preferred to click anywhere on the picture to go to the website.But even as the Hubble team gleaned more about what yielded successful Facebook ads, the algorithm could be unpredictable, almost moody. If you kept loading the same ads into the same ad set every day, they stopped performing as well. The founders figured at first that users were tiring of the same ads. But actual viewer numbers revealed that practically no individual user had seen any ad more than once. The algorithm itself seemed to grow bored. At night, meanwhile, the algorithm spent lots of money and rarely found customers. The Hubble executives started shrinking the budgets at 11 p.m., which they called \u201cputting the algorithm to bed.\u201d The algorithm could also be impulsive and streaky \u2014 some days it might go on a sudden jag, blowing a thousand dollars in a few hours with nothing to show for it. At any time, any one of the 15 different ad sets might go haywire. Rosen found himself checking the Ads Manager compulsively on his laptop and his iPhone. (Facebook offers an iOS app for advertisers.) \u201cIt occupies my brain constantly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling of \u2018Did you leave the oven on?\u2019\u2009\u201dOne night we went to a standup-comedy night Rosen hosted at a bar called Muchmore\u2019s in Brooklyn. (For the past four years, he has moonlighted as a comedian.) But while the other comics were onstage, Rosen was on the Ads Manager the whole time. \u201cWho cares about jokes?\u201d he quipped afterward.Eager for help, Rosen sought guidance from a former Facebook employee named Faheem Siddiqi, who now runs his own marketing agency. Hubble\u2019s sales representative at Facebook told him that Siddiqi had figured out the best ways to optimize Facebook advertising campaigns. But it turned out that Siddiqi and his employees checked the Ads Manager even more compulsively than Rosen \u2014 every half-hour, for up to 16 hours a day. When I asked Siddiqi to share his tips for managing Facebook ads, he replied, \u201cStep\u20091 is meditation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a baby,\u201d Jesse Horwitz told me. \u201cIf you go more than half an hour without checking in on it, it\u2019s probably dead.\u201d (Horwitz, who is married, does not yet have children.)Recently ProPublica, the investigative-journalism nonprofit, showed how bad actors can abuse this process: Facebook\u2019s software gave advertisers the option to target \u201cJew Haters,\u201d for instance. In a separate investigation, ProPublica found that Facebook made it possible to exclude specific \u201cethnic affinities\u201d from seeing ads, noting that ads excluding people based on race are prohibited by federal housing and employment laws.This stereotyping isn\u2019t a glitch of Facebook\u2019s machine-learning process \u2014 it\u2019s how the software works. To formulate audiences, the algorithm scours profiles and analyzes them for shared traits and correlations and self-identified interests and, it assumes, our preferences, grouping us into tribes that can be targeted. It\u2019s up to Facebook and advertisers to constrain this amoral process in ethical and lawful ways. Yet the ethics of targeting are not clear-cut. In May, The Australian reported that Facebook employees had prepared a document showing how they could gather details on teenagers during vulnerable moments \u2014 when Facebook users feel \u201cstressed,\u201d \u201cinsecure,\u201d \u201cdefeated\u201d or \u201cworthless.\u201d Is that immoral, or simply crass?Such challenges are opening a new front for companies and corporate-responsibility watchdogs. Bad human actors don\u2019t pose the only problem; a machine-learning algorithm, left unchecked, can misbehave and compound inequality on its own, no help from humans needed. The same mechanism that decides that 30-something women who like yoga disproportionately buy Lululemon tights \u2014 and shows them ads for more yoga wear \u2014 would also show more junk-food ads to impoverished populations rife with diabetes and obesity.\u201cSometimes data behaves unethically,\u201d Antonio Garcia-Martinez, a former Facebook employee who worked on the advertising team, wrote in an essay in The Guardian. He provided an example from his time at the company: \u201cSomeone on the data-science team had cooked up a new tool that recommended Facebook pages users should like. And what did this tool start spitting out? Every ethnic stereotype you can imagine.\u201dAs algorithms sort users in increasingly complex ways \u2014 already the multivaried criteria for determining a Lookalike group defies human comprehension \u2014 regulators and companies will have to confront how to determine who is being nudged, and why, and whether that\u2019s benefiting the public or exacerbating societal ills. An algorithm that draws its lessons from the present reality can\u2019t be counted on to improve the course of the future on its own.Facebook\u2019s A.I. isn\u2019t operating unattended, certainly: Garcia-Martinez wrote that Facebook decided not to release the recommendation tool. Facebook points out that it makes efforts to prevent harmful advertising. It does not, for instance, allow ads for payday loans, which prey on the poor. It says it has removed advertisers\u2019 ability to target users by ethnicity when promoting housing, employment or credit; it removed \u201cJew Haters\u201d and other objectionable categories and said it would increase human review of its ad-targeting options. In response to the report in The Australian, Facebook said the analysis \u201cwas intended to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook. It was never used to target ads.\u201dYet managing a platform this way \u2014 seeing what mischief the algorithm and its users gets up to, then responding with countermeasures \u2014 can be difficult to sustain. \u201cThis is a whack-a-mole problem, one among many Facebook has,\u201d Garcia-Martinez told me. It makes Facebook, a company still largely controlled by a single man, Mark Zuckerberg, the ultimate arbiter of morality and taste for all two billion of its users. It also means the company has unilateral power to make or break companies when it tweaks its system.This is not a hypothetical possibility. In 2013, media sites like those measured by the BuzzFeed Partner network, which includes BuzzFeed, Thought Catalog and The New York Times, noticed a huge surge in referrals from Facebook \u2014 a jump of more than 50 million page views from August to October. A year later, Facebook announced that it had adjusted its news-feed algorithm to eliminate so-called click bait. Upworthy, a peddler of stories with headlines like \u201c9 Out of 10 Americans Are Completely Wrong About This Mind-Blowing Fact,\u201d had its total page views decline by half in the span of three months, from 90 million to 48 million visitors. (At the time of these huge shifts, 30 percent of Americans got news from Facebook. In 2017, 45 percent of Americans do, according to Pew Research Center.)\u201cWe always knew that Facebook is sort of like the weather,\u201d says Eli Pariser, Upworthy\u2019s co-founder and president. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be sunny days and stormy days.\u201d In response to the algorithm adjustment, Pariser instructed his staff to stop posting as many videos to YouTube, which is owned by Google, and start publishing more videos directly to Facebook instead.\u201cThat certainly served Facebook well,\u201d Pariser admits. \u201cBut you know, I also wouldn\u2019t be able to reach 200 million people on any other medium,\u201d he says, citing the reach of Upworthy\u2019s videos on Facebook. The platform may be mercurial, but Upworthy still relies on it.Imagine, now, that Facebook tweaks its algorithm in a way that \u2014 rather than cause wild swings in web traffic\u200b \u200bto a purveyor of viral videos \u2014 leads to a steep decline in advertising and sales for a consumer-products company, one that happens to be the largest employer in a small town. Or imagine\u200b \u200bmultiple\u200b \u200bcompanies shaken up by such an adjustment, or an entire industry overhauling its practices\u200b \u200bto suit Facebook.\u200b \u200bEven the threat and uncertainty of those possibilities could\u200b \u200bhurt\u200b \u200bbusinesses, which depend on predictable returns to invest in future projects.As we delegate more control to artificial intelligence, both businesses as well as users are venturing into uncertain territory. In the meantime, more and more companies \u2014 start-ups, mom-and-pop stores, major corporations \u2014 are handing their dollars and their data to the social-networking giant. Facebook\u2019s Ads Manager is user-friendly. Sales are plentiful. And if you don\u2019t take advantage of it, your competitors will. How could you not go there?But by the end of June, Rosen\u2019s stress-free life was still a dream. A new problem arose: No matter what new ads they put in an ad set, the growth rate of sales declined and the cost per acquisition went up. They began to think it was an audience problem: Had they found all the customers in those groups? With their ad sets going fallow, the Hubble team scrambled to find fresh and fertile ground. Their ideas for new audiences got quirkier, more outlandish. One week they zeroed in on people who like Sweetgreen, the salad chain. Next they went after people who had indicated that they were fans of bottled water, whoever they are. Each group fizzled after a few days \u2014 the cost per each new customer climbed higher and higher; sales dwindled. As they searched for more and more audience descriptors, they landed upon a novel idea: They began trading their Lookalike groups with other online retailers, figuring that the kind of people who buy one product from social media will probably buy others. This sort of audience sharing is becoming more common on Facebook: There is even a company, TapFwd, that pools together Lookalike groups for various brands, helping them show ads to other groups.Cogan and Horwitz have decided that they need to reduce their dependence on Facebook advertising, for the sake of their business and their own sanity. In May, they tested their first 15-second cable-television commercials. With TV, the data is vaguer, and it takes longer to get results back. Yet even though the old medium provides them with less information than Facebook, in some ways the ignorance is bliss. \u201cThere\u2019s fewer levers; there\u2019s less to stress out about.\u201d Rodgers says. \u201cYou can push the button and get on with your life.\u201dIn August, the Hubble team finally handed over their domestic Facebook advertising work to an outside agency, Ampush, that charges them based on how many new customers sign up. Ten people at Ampush now do the job of Rosen and Robo-Dan. Still, the handoff was bittersweet. \u201cWe ran their numbers \u2014 it\u2019s something we could beat,\u201d Rosen says, meaning Hubble could get more customers for less money if it did the ad buying in-house. \u201cBut it would destroy our lives.\u201dThanks largely to Facebook, Hubble is on track to finish its first full year in business having made $20 million in revenue. In August, Hubble raised $10 million, valuing the company at $210 million. In January, Hubble will use those funds to expand its business to Continental Europe. Its advertising strategy? Robo-Dan, with some help from Rosen. As Hubble advances into new territories, Facebook and the algorithm will be tagging along with them.Burt Helm is a senior contributing writer for Inc. magazine.

The two who are still scheduled to stand trial in Superior Court of the District of Columbia are Aaron Cant\u00fa, a staff reporter at The Santa Fe Reporter in New Mexico who worked as a freelancer in January, and Alexei Wood, a freelance photojournalist and videographer based in San Antonio.Mr. Cant\u00fa, 29, is scheduled to go before a judge in October. The trial for Mr. Wood, 37, is scheduled for Wednesday.Mr. Wood is charged with several felonies, including rioting and destruction of property. He faces up to 61 years in prison if convicted, said his lawyer, Brett E. Cohen.\u201cThe government has not informed me as to why Mr. Wood\u2019s case involved any greater degree of culpability than of the other journalists who were ultimately not charged,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in an email.An April 3 indictment, which lists eight charges against Mr. Wood and 211 other defendants, \u201cdoes not single out Mr. Wood for anything arising from the demonstration,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. A spokesman for the Justice Department said he would not comment on pending cases.Mr. Wood\u2019s lawyer, however, said the video showed that his client was innocent of the charges against him.The footage shows Mr. Wood taking digital-camera photographs, usually from the sidelines, as he live-streams the event. Several times he runs to the front of the group of demonstrators to get a different shot.Occasionally Mr. Wood is heard letting out a cry of \u201cWhoo!\u201d as he captures protesters in the act of spray-painting buildings and throwing rocks through windows. A few times he turns the camera to himself, showing his reactions as the protest escalates.\u201cI could see someone at the D.O.J. saying this is what a protester does,\u201d Mr. Leslie said.\u201cObviously, journalists are not above the law \u2014 they can\u2019t break windows,\u201d Mr. Brody said. \u201cThey can be sympathetic to the people that they cover, and they can draw attention to the people that they cover. But you can\u2019t arrest and you can\u2019t charge journalists for covering events.\u201dToward the end of the video, as the police are about to move in, Mr. Wood is seen identifying himself as a member of the media.Mr. Cohen said Mr. Wood had done nothing illegal. \u201cI believe the government understands the import of charging Mr. Wood but still continues to do so, despite the First Amendment issues,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.Alexandra Ellerbeck, the North America program coordinator for Committee to Protect Journalists, said the law must distinguish between those who covered demonstrations and the participants.\u201cCriminal laws should require criminal intent, and so if a journalist is covering the story, that does not constitute criminal intent,\u201d Ms. Ellerbeck said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t vandalizing property, and the charges against him are incredibly extreme.\u201dThe Washington Metropolitan Police seemingly ignored journalists who presented their credentials, including Mr. Wood, who is seen flashing a press badge in the video.\u201cThe police used the actions of a few window breakers as an excuse of a mass roundup,\u201d said Scott Michelman, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington.In those instances, it seemed that police officers did not distinguish between the alleged lawbreakers and those covering the events. Afterward, Ms. Ellerbeck said, journalists were \u201cforced through a legal process that is expensive and arduous and scary \u2014 and all the more so if you\u2019re a freelance journalist.\u201dMr. Wood, who declined to be interviewed for this article, expressed his feelings about the trial in a blog post on his photography website. \u201cI\u2019ve been confronted with my biases yet I am embodying a \u2018journalist\u2019 identity more than ever,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI honor that duty to a professional level.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Its title, \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe: A Killing on Bay Street,\u201d seems to imply a narrow focus on the Garner killing, belying the book\u2019s prismatic approach to both the people and policies involved in Garner\u2019s life and death.Taibbi has recently come under renewed scrutiny for a 2000 book he co-wrote with Mark Ames, with whom he edited an English-language newspaper in 1990s Russia, in which they describe sexually harassing and assaulting their female employees. Taibbi has since posted two apologies on Facebook, saying that such passages in the book were intended as satire.It is impossible to understand how society\u2019s pressures and inequities wore Garner down without examining an obsession with providing for his family that went so deep that he ignored his own needs. But Taibbi\u2019s reportorial voice, often blunt and forceful, is most compassionate when he is integrating political realities with facts about Garner and the incidents depicted. Taibbi describes in full the horrors of institutionalized poverty in neighborhoods like Tompkinsville, from the real-estate scams that created them to the overseer mentality of the police patrolling them. Crooked landlords and legal quagmires all shaped Garner\u2019s world.Taibbi is smart to depict the structurally racist system of law enforcement in this country as a character in and of itself. The misguided and destructive \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing tactic is portrayed here as Frankenstein\u2019s monster, built with good intentions without thought to tragic consequences. \u201cRight or wrong, the threat of being stopped went from an annoyance to a thing that took over his life,\u201d Taibbi writes. Like the Moirai of Greek mythology, other people made political choices that directed the course of Garner\u2019s life and accelerated its end. The first half of the book, as it progresses, feels increasingly like a train without brakes that is rolling downhill. If readers are unfamiliar with the fatalism and frustration that racial discrimination, poverty and poor policing engender in men like Eric Garner, Taibbi provides an able introduction.Jamil Smith, a journalist and a radio host, is currently a contributing opinion writer at The Los Angeles Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Look Like a Morrissey Fan", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe lookThe photographer Ryan Lowry captured the musician\u2019s devotees in their element.How to get in the mood? I play some vintage Morrissey, circa 1992, the year I most associate with my own fandom, when his songs from \u201cBona Drag,\u201d \u201cKill Uncle\u201d and \u201cYour Arsenal\u201d were the only ones I wanted to hear. \u201cEvery Day Is Like Sunday\u201d still stirs my emotions. And \u201cGlamorous Glue,\u201d bratty and brassy, struts along. The music I know and love from 1990s Moz plays on, and my excitement grows. I sing along to \u201cOur Frank\u201d and \u201cThe Last of the Famous International Playboys\u201d and start to dress for the concert. I look like a Morrissey fan. As I trudge up the path to the Hollywood Bowl with my traveling companions, I watch the thousands of fans making their way up. Moz fans are not unlike the decked-out Dodgers fans swathed in their team\u2019s colors, scripts and logos on game day. (Often, they\u2019re the same people.) And they\u2019re not so different from the paisley purple-clad Prince fans, or the Michael Jackson fans who rock a single white bedazzled glove, a sequined bomber jacket and a tipped-forward black fedora. Moz fans, too, have a code that identifies them. In his 2013 \u201cAutobiography,\u201d Morrissey wrote about his fans in their \u201cfastidious attire\u201d of \u201c\u2018Viva Hate\u2019 emblems; art-hound Ts, tank tops and bags graffitied in Morrissey-code.\u201d He invented this code, and fans receive the message. Morrissey\u2019s quiff is his signifier. In Limerick, Ireland, the popular Manchester Night party at Dolan\u2019s beckons its resident Smiths and Morrissey fans to dance the night away in their best quiffs, NHS spectacles, gladioli and Morrissey T-shirts. In Portland, Ore.,; Fresno, Calif.; and Hollywood, fans adorn themselves with T-shirts, jewelry, badges, buttons and other merchandise that feature Morrissey\u2019s iconic image: angular jawline, prominent brow, close-clipped sideburns and tall quiff. I am with my people. \u201cWe look to Los Angeles for the language we use, London is dead,\u201d Morrissey sings in his 1992 hit \u201cGlamorous Glue.\u201d He sang this song on Morrissey Day, and judging by the fans\u2019 response, Los Angeles \u2014 especially the fans \u2014 looks to Morrissey for the language it uses. We speak in the idioms of the Smiths and Morrissey, swapping lyrics like lovers\u2019 letters or fighters\u2019 fists.

{"Headline": "Revenge of the Obama Coalition", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn his book \u201cActive Faith: How Christians Are Changing the Soul of American Politics,\u201d former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed described 1989, the year the group was founded, as a dark one for religious conservatives. The once-powerful televangelists Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker were discredited by lurid scandals. In Virginia and New Jersey, anti-abortion Republican candidates lost gubernatorial races to pro-choice Democrats. \u201cThe number of conservative votes in Congress dwindled to barely enough to sustain President Bush\u2019s abortion vetoes,\u201d Reed wrote. The movement that had been so formidable at the start of the decade \u201cseemed dead, and cultural elites danced on its grave.\u201dSeeking resurrection, the religious right turned to local politics, investing in the bench of the Republican Party. \u201cWe are training people to be effective \u2014 to be elected to school boards, to city councils, to state legislatures and to key positions in political parties,\u201d Pat Robertson wrote in a 1991 Christian Coalition fund-raising letter. The next year, Sarah Palin would get her start by winning a seat on the Wasilla City Council, part of a wave of evangelicals pouring into local politics.If there is one threadlike silver lining to Donald Trump\u2019s election last year, it\u2019s that it has forced the left to emulate the Christian right\u2019s extremely successful strategy for building political power. For decades, Democrats have paid far less attention to local politics than Republicans. That\u2019s part of the reason the party lost almost a thousand state legislative seats \u2014 there are 7383 in total \u2014 over the course of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. But in the last year, citizens nationwide \u2014 particularly women and people of color \u2014 who were horrified by Trump\u2019s victory have decided to run for office in their own communities. And on Tuesday, many of them won.For the past year, the Democratic Party has been engaged in an angry internal debate over identity politics, which are often framed in opposition to a purely class-based appeal. At times, it feels like progressives are doomed to re-litigate the 2016 Democratic primary forever, tearing each other apart while Trump tears down the republic. But if you squint at Tuesday\u2019s results, you can sort of see a synthesis emerging between Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s theory of the emerging Democratic electorate \u2014 in which Democrats win by appealing to a coalition of white professionals and minorities \u2014 and Bernie Sanders\u2019s focus on grass-roots organizing and economic populism.In some ways the election was the revenge of the Obama coalition. Educated white liberals joined people of color to elect an amazingly diverse group of candidates. A Latina single mother, Michelle De La Isla, was elected mayor of Topeka, Kan. Wilmot Collins, a refugee from Liberia, won the mayoral race in Helena, Mont. Seattle elected its first lesbian mayor, Jenny Durkan. After a year in which liberals have been bludgeoned by demands that they abandon identity politics and empathize with resentful Trump voters, the election was a reminder that white men needn\u2019t be the center of the political universe.Yet class politics and identity politics aren\u2019t really a binary, even if they\u2019re sometimes presented that way. Murillo, for example, the first person in her family to graduate from either high school or college, told me that affordable housing was a central issue in her campaign. Overall, Tuesday was a great night for economic populists. Before this week, the Democratic Socialists of America had 20 elected officials among its membership. On Tuesday, 15 more won local office, including 30-year-old Marine veteran Lee Carter, who unseated the Republican majority whip in Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.Run For Something is part of a robust progressive grass-roots infrastructure that has emerged from the wreckage of the 2016 election. In the past year, membership in the Democratic Socialists of America has more than tripled, to around 25,000. Every congressional district in the country now has at least two Indivisible chapters, and on Thursday Indivisible launched a new program to mobilize these chapters for elections. In the past, the right was far better than the left at channeling its activist energy into electoral politics, but that\u2019s finally starting to change. Perhaps the Resistance can do for Democrats what the religious right did for Republicans. If so, it will start local, but it won\u2019t end there.Advertisement"}

After they separated, Ms. Chaulk sought help from a therapist. So too did Benjamin Hertwig, the other woman\u2019s husband.What happened next became the subject of one of the most popular essays in the Modern Love column\u2019s 13-year history. In 2016, a million people read Mr. Hertwig\u2019s account of crossing paths with Ms. Chaulk in the waiting room. \u201cAre you the wife of the guy my wife is having an affair with?\u201d he blurted; the therapist, alarmed by the damage their meeting might cause, came rushing out of the office to make sure everything was O.K. It was, and afterward the two bonded over coffee.We have always imagined love as a species of serendipity. When the Modern Love column began in 2004, however, the definition of \u201cmodern\u201d was arguably different: Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat did not exist, and so the daily deluge of public confessionals was still to come.But love has always been complex, and the column has always made a virtue out of messiness. Over time, Modern Love has kept pace with the ever-multiplying varieties of human connection, and 80,000 submissions, 670 published columns, one book and 99 podcasts later, the paper is celebrating the column\u2019s teenagehood. Spearheaded by Ethan Hauser, a Styles editor, and the Modern Love editor Daniel Jones, the section explores ideas like the long tail of chance, in the case of Ms. Chaulk and Mr. Hertwig\u2019s experience; the immediacy of Iraqi refugees of being separated by paperwork; and the language men and women use to talk about all of these experiences.\u201cI\u2019m still struck by how disarming it can be, as a reader, to encounter someone who\u2019s confronting pain, heartbreak, loss or just confusion and trying to make sense of it all,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s able to wade into her own mess with curiosity and humility instead of bitterness and self-pity. I think we can learn from that kind of storytelling, and what you get out of it depends on what you bring to it \u2014 what your own baggage is.\u201dWhile some pieces go long, others go short \u2014 very short. Using social media, the editors asked readers to submit love stories told in 13 words or less. They received nearly 9,000 in response.In the end, 13 were chosen. One of Mr. Hauser\u2019s favorites came from Grace Gardner in Atlanta: \u201cMy dad calls my mom Love, almost as if that is her name.\u201d (\u201cI thought it was kind of wonderfully sweet but still not totally cheesy,\u201d he said.)The editors also included postscripts to past columns. \u201cMany of these stories took place a decade or more in the past, and a lot has happened since: marriages have dissolved, people have died, strained ties have mended,\u201d Mr. Jones said.In Ms. Chaulk\u2019s case, her connection with Mr. Hertwig was far more valuable than visits to a counselor. The two have stayed in touch on Facebook and continue to root for each other as they both pursue new relationships.\u201cThey are connected now, and hopefully their lives will go on, and each of them will find love and lasting love and a family,\u201d Mr. Kurutz said. \u201cIn some way they are connected through the experience they had, and through the Modern Love column. Sometimes very brief encounters have a significance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Where the STEM Jobs Are (and Where They Aren\u2019t)", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe national priority in education can be summed up in a four-letter acronym: STEM. And that\u2019s understandable. A country\u2019s proficiency in science, technology, engineering and mathematics is vital in generating economic growth, advancing scientific innovation and creating good jobs.The STEM campaign has been underway for years, championed by policymakers across the ideological spectrum, embraced in schools everywhere and by organizations ranging from the YWCA to the Boy Scouts. By now, the term \u2014 first popularized and promoted by the National Science Foundation \u2014 is used as a descriptive identifier. \u201cShe\u2019s a STEM,\u201d usually meant as a compliment, suggests someone who has a leg up in the college admissions sweepstakes.Much of the public enthusiasm for STEM education rests on the assumption that these fields are rich in job opportunity. Some are, some aren\u2019t. STEM is an expansive category, spanning many disciplines and occupations, from software engineers and data scientists to geologists, astronomers and physicists.What recent studies have made increasingly apparent is that the greatest number of high-paying STEM jobs are in the \u201cT\u201d (specifically, computing).\u201cThere is a huge divide between the computing technology roles and the traditional sciences,\u201d said Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor\u2019s chief economist.In a recent analysis, Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, focused on the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment forecasts in STEM categories. In the decade ending in 2024, 73 percent of STEM job growth will be in computer occupations, but only 3 percent will be in the physical sciences and 3 percent in the life sciences.A working grasp of the principles of science and math should be essential knowledge for all Americans, said Michael S. Teitelbaum, an expert on science education and policy. But he believes that STEM advocates, often executives and lobbyists for technology companies, do a disservice when they raise the alarm that America is facing a worrying shortfall of STEM workers, based on shortages in a relative handful of fast-growing fields like data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and computer security.\u201cWhen it gets generalized to all of STEM, it\u2019s misleading,\u201d said Mr. Teitelbaum, a senior research associate in the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School. \u201cWe\u2019re misleading a lot of young people.\u201dIf physicists and biologists want to enjoy the boom times in the digital economy, a few specialist start-ups will train them and find them jobs as data scientists and artificial intelligence programmers.Carlos Faham made that passage. He had an impressive academic career, with a string of grant awards and fellowships. His Ph.D. from Brown University was in dark-matter physics. After Brown, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.Dr. Faham loved the research, but after nearly two years he was feeling the strain of that life. By then, he had spent 12 years in college, graduate school and postgraduate research. His next step would be to compete for a handful of tenure-track teaching openings across the country. For the pricey Bay Area, he wasn\u2019t making enough. A postdoc researcher typically makes $40,000 to $60,000 a year.Dr. Faham had done serious programming for his physics research. He applied to tech companies, figuring they would be eager to hire someone with his intellectual firepower. He couldn\u2019t get an in-person interview. He was told his background was too academic. He fumbled a couple of phone screening interviews because the statistical and machine-learning problems were unfamiliar to him.\u201cIt was like hitting a wall running at full speed, really humbling,\u201d he recalled.Dr. Faham joined the seven-week Insight Data Science Fellows program in 2015. There was no formal course work. Other than a few tutorials by industry people, the time was spent creating a product \u2014 his was software for recognizing and tracking faces in video \u2014 and training for interviews. That involved solving a programming problem on a white board and explaining his thinking. \u201cInterviewing is a muscle and you have to exercise it again and again,\u201d he said. After the program, he received six job offers. He accepted the offer from LinkedIn. (Insight is free for participants; hiring companies pay an undisclosed fee.)Today, Dr. Faham, 33, is a senior data scientist, working on a team that uses machine learning and statistical models to detect illicit activity on the social network, including fake job listings, ad fraud, spam and bot attacks.The range of data-intensive detective work, he said, is \u201cextremely rich\u201d and \u201cit moves so much faster than my previous world.\u201d He makes a \u201cpretty good six-figure salary,\u201d about five times what he did as a postdoctoral researcher.About 90 percent of those who enter the Insight program have landed jobs as data analysts, the company says, with a dropout rate of about 3 percent.Anasuya Das made a similar career move, but not one as far from her academic training. After the program, Dr. Das, whose Ph.D. is in neuroscience, joined the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she is now a senior data scientist. She works on a team that creates software tools for the center\u2019s doctors, nurses and researchers. One current project is a program to recommend the most promising clinical trials for individual cancer patients, based on their medical histories, age, gender and genetics.Data science is distinctly different from neuroscience, Dr. Das said, but some of the tools she employs, like a machine-learning technique called artificial neural networks, do take their inspiration from the brain. Her experience points to the larger trend that digital technologies like data science and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in nearly every discipline. So technology and the other STEM fields merge.That is the thinking behind a new division of data sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, that started in July. The division is a response to student demand and advancing technology. Berkeley\u2019s \u201cFoundations of Data Science\u201d course attracted 1,200 students from more than 50 majors in the last academic year.The choice of the term \u201cdivision\u201d rather than \u201cinstitute,\u201d explained David Culler, the interim dean for data sciences, underlines its approach. \u201cWe want this to be something foundational across the university, innovating with other disciplines, not differentiating from them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the academic world mirroring what is happening in the larger economy.\u201dSteve Lohr is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

Lawmakers questioned Facebook \u2014 as well as Google and Twitter \u2014 about how Russians may have misused online ads and other parts of their platforms to sow discord and inflame tensions in the American electorate.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that you\u2019re here, and not your C.E.O.s,\u201d Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, said during a hearing on Wednesday morning.In a statement, Mr. Zuckerberg added, \u201cProtecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d noting that the amount of money Facebook is spending on security will affect the company\u2019s bottom line.On Wednesday, Facebook said its online ads business rose by 49 percent to $10.1 billion for the quarter. Much of that success continues to hinge on its ability to make money from people using smartphones; some 88 percent of Facebook\u2019s advertising revenue is derived from mobile devices.The performance was bolstered by Facebook\u2019s push into video advertising, which the company has prioritized for the past two years. Advertisers are generally charged more for video ads than static ads because of the engaging nature of the content.Mr. Zuckerberg said video would remain a top priority for the company\u2019s revenue growth over the next three years. David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, also earmarked video as an area for heavy investment in 2018.That spending will go into Facebook\u2019s nascent efforts of funding new original shows for streaming, specifically on the social network. Money will also go toward making video products more \u201csocial,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg, as a way to strengthen the bonds between the people who regularly use Facebook.Another reason for the successful quarter: user growth. Already home to more than two billion people who regularly use the social network every month, Facebook\u2019s number of users grew another 16 percent to 2.07 billion people. Some 1.37 billion people use the site on a daily basis.To make sure that growth stays on track, Facebook plans to spend even more. The company said it employs more than 23,000 full-time workers, up 47 percent from the same period a year ago. Facebook reported more than $1.76 billion in capital expenditures.More hiring is in the works. During this week\u2019s hearings, Facebook executives said they planned to hire 10,000 more workers to increase safety and review content across the platform, doubling to 20,000 reviewers. Facebook and other companies typically use less expensive third-party companies, not full-time in-house employees, to review content.Facebook also said it would keep investing in its still-fledgling virtual and augmented reality businesses.The company also made clear that even as it has faced grilling from lawmakers over what has been posted and shared on its site by Russian actors, it will not go overboard by stifling free expression on the social network.\u201cWe believe that ads are important to free expression,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said during the earnings call. \u201cBut we will also do our part to elevate the quality of those ads.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now they post #metoo. Social media, famous accusers and generational change add up to a profound shift.Supported byForty years ago this month, Ms. magazine put sexual harassment on its cover for the first time. Understanding the sensitivity of the topic, the editors used puppets for the cover image \u2014 a male hand reaching into a woman\u2019s blouse \u2014 rather than a photograph. It was banned from some supermarkets nonetheless.In 1977, the term sexual harassment had not been defined in the law and had barely entered the public lexicon. And yet, to read that Ms. article today, amid a profound shift in discourse, is to feel haunted by its familiarity.It describes an executive assistant who quit after her boss asked for oral sex; a student who dropped out after being assaulted by her adviser; a black medical administrator whose white supervisor asked if the women in her neighborhood were prostitutes \u2014 and, subsequently, if she would have group sex with him and several colleagues.Citing a survey in which 88 percent of women said they were harassed at work, the author said the problem permeated almost every profession, but was particularly pernicious \u201cin the supposedly glamorous profession of acting,\u201d in which Hollywood\u2019s casting couch remained a \u201cstrong convention.\u201d\u201cWhat we have so far seen,\u201d the article stated, \u201cis only the tip of a very large and very destructive iceberg.\u201dA great many women \u2014 and some men, too \u2014 have also spoken out more openly and more forcefully than ever before about what happens behind closed doors or even in the open spaces of studios, newsrooms and other workplaces. Companies have rushed to reassert zero-tolerance policies and whipped together training programs.But this sequel seems to have a surprise ending, or at least a plot twist: The public outrage is deeper and more sustained, and the dominoes continue to fall.Maybe it\u2019s that the accusers this time were famous, media-savvy and mostly white actors with more star power than the accused (unlike, say, Paula Jones vs. Bill Clinton). Maybe it\u2019s reflective of a specific period in American history, in which working women of a new generation \u2014 those who had grown up with working mothers \u2014 decided that enough was enough.Several experts likened it to a dam breaking, the cumulative effect of harassment claims over decades and especially the last few years. Some see it as the other shoe dropping after Donald J. Trump\u2019s taped boasting about offensive behavior did not block his path to the presidency: He may have gotten away with it, but women were no longer going to let that boss, that mentor, that colleague get away with it, too.An Army of VoicesI\u2019ve heard from women who said they\u2019ve retroactively confronted their harassers and those who enabled them, and from men who are re-examining, perhaps somewhat nervously, their own behavior. The new conversation goes way beyond the workplace to sweep in street harassment, rape culture and \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d \u2014 terminology that would have been confined to gender studies classes, not found in mainstream newspapers, not so long ago.With Mr. Weinstein, the accusers were on the record, poised, and more of them seem to emerge each day, so no individual had to bear the burden alone, as Professor Hill had. \u201cWhen you have Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow in the same sentence, well, people take note,\u201d the sociologist Michael Kimmel said.But behind these famous faces was an army of ordinary voices, too, using social media to collectively tell their stories \u2014 but also for action. In the case of Bill O\u2019Reilly, remember, it was a coordinated effort, by groups that included the organizers of the Women\u2019s March, that urged advertisers to #DropOReilly. They, and Fox News, ultimately did.Another significant new element is the presence of what many have called silent co-conspirators: dozens of people, over dozens of years, who knew what was going on but did nothing.A Look BackIf this is a moment of historical social change, it is worth looking at what led us here.Then came Professor Hill, whose televised testimony about Mr. Thomas, her former boss \u2014 at the E.E.O.C., of all places \u2014 was, Ms. Berg said, in effect \u201chome-schooling a generation of Americans in what sexual harassment was.\u201d Almost immediately, the phone hotline for 9to5, a support group for working women, began ringing off the hook.Ms. Berg said she remembers a former colleague calling to ask, of their former boss, \u201cDid he proposition you, too?\u201d (He had.) Professor Kimmel said his mother told him over dinner that she was harassed in graduate school.\u201cIt was literally water-cooler conversation everywhere,\u201d said Freada Kapor Klein, who conducted one of the first surveys on sexual harassment in the 1970s.But most of those stories were shared in private \u2014 in part because of what the world watched Professor Hill endure. Before an all-male Senate judiciary panel, she was accused of bringing \u201csleaze\u201d into the nomination process, portrayed as suffering from delusional fantasies, and famously called, by the pundit David Brock, \u201ca little bit nutty and a little bit slutty.\u201d\u201cI remember the anger of that moment,\u201d Teresa Younger, then a 22-year-old nanny and now president of the Ms. Foundation for Women, said. \u201cAnita Hill was the example of a strong, accomplished black woman, and if she of all people could be discredited then it seemed women, particularly women of color, had no voice when it came to sexual harassment.\u201dFrom \u2018I Believe\u2019 to #metooIt\u2019s worth noting that the campaign slogan back then, on buttons and bumper stickers rather than Facebook and Twitter, was not \u201cMe Too\u201d but \u201cI Believe Anita\u201d \u2014 a message of solidarity, not self-exposure.\u201cI think for a long time it shut women up, at least publicly,\u201d Professor Kimmel said.Professor Kimmel, the sociologist, said, \u201cThere comes a tipping point when the \u2018frame\u2019 changes.\u201d\u201dOne day, segregated water fountains seemed \u2018normal\u2019 if you were a white Southerner,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt\u2019s just how things were. Then they\u2019re illegal, and a few years later you say, \u2018Wow, how did we ever see that as O.K.?\u2019\u201dMs. Friedman, though, said she is waiting for an important moment: \u201cWhen are we going to start believing people the first time?\u201d\u201cWhen is it going to be that one instance is enough, and that you don\u2019t have to find out 30 years later?\u201d she asked. \u201cI also worry that there is the possibility for this to be treated like a cancer, and now Harvey is gone so the cancer is excised.

Over the course of the 1960s, after Kennedy\u2019s death, those divisions would deepen. Our current decade bears parallels to that time. We are still a fractured nation. We are still entangled in innumerable foreign wars. And we still, even on Thanksgiving, struggle to recognize one another as countrymen across economic, political and racial divides.In the proclamation, Kennedy quotes Washington, who in his inaugural call for a thanksgiving asked the citizens of the new republic to beseech God \u201cto pardon our national and other transgressions.\u201d Kennedy was writing after the Bay of Pigs invasion, after the first \u201cmilitary advisers\u201d had arrived in Vietnam, and only two months after the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in which members of the Ku Klux Klan murdered four African-American girls.

I have celebrated the holiday at a Chinese restaurant with Turkish artists and writers, over kebabs with Afghan warlords, and by splitting up the best parts of a box of MREs with Iraqi special police.Giving thanks over a meal bridges the widest cultural divides. It makes friends of wary allies and, in certain cases, friends of enemies. And, today, we should let it work at home. A national day of gratitude can serve a double purpose. It can also be a national day of healing before \u2014 sadly \u2014 we retrench into our perceived differences.Maybe I\u2019m overanalyzing Kennedy\u2019s proclamation. Perhaps it was just a few paragraphs drafted by a staff member. Yet it reads as if it wasn\u2019t. It reads as if Kennedy was asking the country to do one last thing: Take a break from divisions.

Neither side gave many details, apart from a vague commitment to beginning a repatriation process within two months\u2019 time.While Myanmar has pushed for the return of any Rohingya to be conducted bilaterally, the Bangladeshis have called for international agencies to be involved.Earlier, the Myanmar authorities said they would, in principle, allow for the return of displaced Rohingya if they could prove that they had lived in Myanmar before fleeing across the border over the past three months.Mr. Ali, who in September accused Myanmar\u2019s military of killing thousands of Rohingya, said he would not divulge the terms and conditions of any accord until Saturday. But he put the onus of responsibility on Myanmar.Refugees pouring into Bangladesh from Rakhine, in Myanmar\u2019s west, have described civilians being executed, women gang-raped and villages systematically razed by fire.\u201cSince their houses are burned and destroyed,\u201d Mr. Ali said, \u201cthey need to be rebuilt.\u201dThe Myanmar authorities have in recent weeks balked at the possibility of the Rohingya, whom they consider to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, returning to their native villages. Instead, Myanmar\u2019s government has spoken obliquely of camps where they might be sequestered.Around 120,000 Rohingya already live in such camps in the central part of Rakhine after a wave of violence in 2012 forced them from their homes.In late October, officials in Myanmar ordered the harvesting of fields that had been deserted in the Rohingya exodus. The authorities in Myanmar have said they will confiscate all land that they consider \u201cabandoned.\u201dOther serious obstacles remain to any repatriation. For one, it\u2019s not clear whether Myanmar\u2019s military, which largely succeeded in ridding a Buddhist-majority country of a hated Muslim minority, would accept a proof of their residence if returning Rohingya were even able to offer it. Many fled without any papers. Others never had any.Almost all Rohingya are stateless, stuck in an official netherworld between the two countries.It\u2019s also not certain whether the vast majority of Rohingya would want to return to a place where the security forces have unleashed what the United States and others have labeled crimes against humanity.\u201cI will never go back home,\u201d said Mohamed Rafique, a Muslim cleric who arrived in a refugee camp in Bangladesh in September. \u201cHow can I go back to a place where they want to kill me?\u201dBangladesh, itself poor and overcrowded, is struggling to cope with the influx, which has created on the country\u2019s eastern flank one of the world\u2019s largest refugee camps.Human rights groups worry that this sprawling settlement could be a breeding ground for disease and religious radicalism.The latest surge of refugees began after Rohingya militants attacked Myanmar security outposts in late August. A previous strike by Rohingya insurgents a year ago also sent around 100,000 refugees to Bangladesh.Meanwhile, Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of Myanmar\u2019s military, said in a statement last week that \u201cit is impossible to accept the number of persons proposed by Bangladesh.\u201dHe also raised doubts about any repatriation process, saying that it had to be \u201cacceptable\u201d to ethnic Rakhine Buddhists who have been accused of aiding in pogroms against the Rohingya.\u201cEmphasis must be placed on the wishes of local Rakhine ethnic people who are real Myanmar citizens,\u201d said an English statement on the military commander\u2019s Facebook page, before warning that any \u201cunacceptable situation\u201d could lead to \u201cpolitical instability.\u201dAKM Moinuddin contributed reporting from Naypyidaw.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Coast Guard\u2019s \u2018Floating Guant\u00e1namos\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "FeatureIn an expansion of the war on drugs, the U.S. Coast Guard is targeting low-level smugglers in international waters \u2014 shackling them on ships for weeks or even months before arraignment in American courts.Supported byBy day Arcentales would stand against the wall and stare out at the water, his mind blank one moment, the next racing with thoughts of his wife and their newborn son. He had not spoken to his family, though he asked each day to call home. He increasingly felt panicked, fearing his wife would believe he was dead.Arcentales has wide muscular shoulders from his 25 years hauling fishing nets from the sea. But his meals now consisted of a handful of rice and beans, and he could feel his body shrinking from the undernourishment and immobility. \u201cThe moment we would stand up, we would get nauseated, our heads would spin,\u201d he recalled. The 20-some prisoners aboard the vessel \u2014 Ecuadorians, Guatemalans and Colombians \u2014 would often stand through the night, their backs aching, their bodies frigid from the wind and rain, waiting for the morning sun to rise and dry them.In the first weeks, Arcentales had turned to his friend Carlos Quijije, another fisherman from the small town of Jaramij\u00f3, to calm him. They were chained side by side, and the 26-year-old would offer some perspective. \u201cRelax brother, everything is going to work out,\u201d Arcentales remembered Quijije saying. \u201cThey\u2019ll take us to Ecuador, and we will see our families.\u201d But after two months of being shackled aboard the ship, Quijije seemed just as despondent. They often thought they would simply disappear.By this time it was November 2014, and in the brick box of a house where Arcentales lived in Ecuador, Lorena Mendoza, Arcentales\u2019s wife, and their children were praying together for his return. In Jaramij\u00f3, it is not unheard-of for fishermen to vanish, stranded by a broken motor, shot by a pirate or shipwrecked in a storm. \u201cI was always worried that we would never see him again,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut he always came home.\u201d This time Mendoza was certain she would receive a call to collect Arcentales\u2019s waterlogged body from the docks.Mendoza had no way of knowing that her husband was still alive. He had departed Jaramij\u00f3 because his family needed money so desperately that he had accepted a job smuggling cocaine off the coast of Ecuador. But deep in the Pacific, Arcentales and the other fishermen he traveled with were stopped not by pirates or vigilantes but by the United States Coast Guard, deployed more than 2,000 miles from U.S. shores to trawl for Andean cocaine. Over the past six years, more than 2,700 men like Arcentales have been taken from boats suspected of smuggling Colombian cocaine to Central America, to be carried around the ocean for weeks or months as the American ships continue their patrols. These fishermen-turned-smugglers are caught in international waters, or in foreign seas, and often have little or no understanding of where the drugs aboard their boats are ultimately bound. Yet nearly all of these boatmen are now carted from the Pacific and delivered to the United States to face criminal charges here, in what amounts to a vast extraterritorial exertion of American legal might.Congress responded by passing a set of laws, including the 1986 Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, that defined drug smuggling in international waters as a crime against the United States, even when there was no proof that the drugs, often carried on foreign boats, were bound for the United States. The Coast Guard was conscripted as the agency empowered to seek out suspected smugglers and bring them to American courts.In the 1990s and through the 2000s, maritime detentions averaged around 200 a year. Then in 2012, the Department of Defense\u2019s Southern Command, tasked with leading the war on drugs in the Americas, launched a multinational military campaign called Operation Martillo, or \u201chammer.\u201d The goal was to shut down smuggling routes in the waters between South and Central America, stopping large shipments of cocaine carried on speedboats thousands of miles from the United States, long before they could be broken down and carried over land into Mexico and then into the United States. In 2016, under the Southern Command\u2019s strategy, the Coast Guard, with intermittent help from the U.S. Navy and international partners, detained 585 suspected drug smugglers, mostly in international waters. That year, 80 percent of these men were taken to the United States to face criminal charges, up from a third of detainees in 2012. In the 12 months that ended in September 2017, the Coast Guard captured more than 700 suspects and chained them aboard American ships.Over the last year, I\u2019ve interviewed seven former Coast Guard detainees, some of whom are still in American federal prison, and received detailed letters, some with pencil renderings of the detention ships, from a dozen others. Most of these men remain confounded by their capture by the Americans, dubious that U.S. officials had the authority to arrest them and to lock them in prison. But it is the memory of their surreal imprisonment at sea that these men say most torments them. Together with thousands of pages of court records and interviews with current and former Coast Guard officers, these detainees paint a grim picture of the conditions of their extended capture on ships deployed in the extraterritorial war on drugs.Their protracted detention is justified by Coast Guard officials and federal prosecutors alike, who argue that suspects like Arcentales are not formally under arrest when the Coast Guard detains them. While on board, they\u2019re not read Miranda rights, not appointed lawyers, not allowed to contact their consulate or their families. They don\u2019t appear to benefit from federal rules of criminal procedure that require that criminal suspects arrested outside the United States be presented before a judge \u201cwithout unnecessary delay.\u201d It is as if their rights are in suspension during their capture at sea. \u201cIt\u2019s hard-wired into the Coast Guard\u2019s minds,\u201d says Eugene R. Fidell, a former Coast Guard lawyer who teaches at Yale Law School, \u201cthat usual law enforcement constraints don\u2019t apply.\u201dThe increased detentions and the domestic prosecutions of extraterritorial activity were ushered in largely under the watch of Gen. John Kelly, who from 2012 to 2016 served as the head of the Southern Command and is now the White House chief of staff. He has long championed the idea that drug smuggling and the drug-related violence in Central America poses what he has called an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to the United States and that to protect the homeland, American law enforcement must reach beyond U.S. borders. This April, during his brief tenure as Trump\u2019s secretary of Homeland Security, which now oversees the Coast Guard, Kelly gave a lecture at George Washington University. \u201cWe are a nation under attack\u201d from transnational criminal networks, he told the audience. \u201cThe more we push our borders out, the safer our homeland will be,\u201d he said. \u201cThat includes Coast Guard drug interdictions at sea.\u201d Asked about the detainments, a White House spokesperson said, \u201cUnder General Kelly\u2019s command, U.S. personnel treated detainees humanely and followed applicable laws.\u201d The spokesperson declined to comment further.Arcentales never had much money. The $6,000 he could hope to make a year, on the skiff and working on tuna ships for a month or two at a time, does not stretch far in Ecuador\u2019s economy. The house where he and Mendoza lived was just a single room for their family of nine: their teenage son, Enrique; Mendoza\u2019s two older daughters from a previous marriage, Nelly and Juliana, who have three children between them; and Nelly\u2019s husband, Wladimir Jaramillo. They all slept on fraying mattresses, sharing a single toilet. When it rained, the roof leaked and muddy water trickled through the door.The thrum of anxiety about money became an alarm in 2014 when Mendoza unexpectedly became pregnant at 43. A doctor prescribed bed rest. Too worried to be out at sea for long, Arcentales worked less. That July, Mendoza gave birth to a boy they named Ismael. The household had grown to 10. It would be more than two months before his next fishing trip, and Arcentales could not escape the nagging sense of failure. \u201cI would lie some nights in bed, asking myself, \u2018Am I going to live my entire life in a hut that is close to falling apart?\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201c\u2009\u2018What will I leave my children?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe next evening, he and Quijije met another man in San Lorenzo, near the Colombian border. The man led them to a skiff, gave Arcentales a GPS tracker and instructed the pair to meet another boat at a location 50 nautical miles away. There, he said, they would collect 100 kilos of cocaine, split in four packages, and the coordinates for another vessel less than a day\u2019s trip away where they would drop off the drugs and then be done. But when they arrived at the location to retrieve the drugs, they were instead given 440 kilos of cocaine and joined by a baby-faced Colombian in his early 20s named Jair Guevara Payan, paid to watch the drugs. Payan led Arcentales and Quijije on a five-day voyage, 1,100 miles to the north, farther than either man had ever ventured. Arcentales considered refusing to go, but he knew there was no real choice now that they were at sea. \u201cWe had been screwed,\u201d he told me.When Arcentales, Quijije and Payan finally arrived at their final coordinates, 145 miles off the coast of Guatemala, a small white speedboat motored toward them, then another, each manned by two Guatemalan men. Together, the men offloaded the drugs onto one of the boats, and Payan motored away on it with a pair of Guatemalan brothers. Arcentales and Quijije were told to step into the second boat, a skiff called the Yeny Arg, manned by the two other Guatemalans, Giezi Zamora, a mechanic, and Hector Castillo, a fisherman. The four of them headed for shore, and Arcentales let his senses dull for the first time since he had set out. \u201cWe are free,\u201d he thought to himself, and nearly fell asleep.But a U.S. Navy patrol airplane had been tracking the Guatemalan boats since the morning. The plane\u2019s crew had watched the men step into the arriving boats and the Southern Command had contacted the Coast Guard. Soon, Arcentales spotted a white military ship, then a speedboat with five officers aboard racing toward them. The officers ordered Arcentales and the others not to move, and the men raised their hands in the air.When boats are not registered to a country or flying a country\u2019s flag, they are considered stateless, and maritime laws allow U.S. officials to board. Hundreds of these unmarked boats depart from Ecuador and Colombia each year. But the Yeny Arg was registered in Guatemala, so federal officials contacted their Guatemalan counterparts to gain permission, under a bilateral agreement, to board and conduct a search. U.S. authorities have some 40 agreements with countries around the world to gain access to foreign vessels. For some countries, U.S. prosecution removes a burden from their own legal systems; with other countries, the U.S. has exerted pressure on governments to forge such agreements. Countries in the Americas and the Caribbean have generally allowed U.S. officials to board and search ships that bear their flags.For several hours, the Coast Guard officers searched the Yeny Arg. By midafternoon, Arcentales, Quijije and the two Guatamalans were moved to the Coast Guard speedboat, and were delivered to the Coast Guard ship. On board, they had mug shots taken. Less than 12 hours later, the men were moved to a Coast Guard ship called the Boutwell, a 378-foot, 46-year-old cutter with a crew of 160. Payan and the Guatemalan brothers were already onboard.The men were not told where they would be taken nor allowed to call their families. Officials told them to strip down and change into papery white Tyvek jump suits, and then guards led them up a flight of stairs above the deck and into a hangar. Arcentales felt a cuff close around his ankle. He and Quijije looked at each other, and then at their ankles, which, he said, were now attached to the floor by short chains. Thin rubber mats would serve as their beds. \u201cA deep sadness came over me,\u201d Arcentales said. \u201cRight there my life changed.\u201dBut as they approached land, a guard showed up with a plastic bucket to use as a toilet. An officer closed the doors of the hangar where they were held. Through small holes in the wall, they could see people walking on the docks. The Guatemalans recognized a port called Acajutla. An hour passed, then four, then eight. When the narrow beams of light that had shone through the holes in the hangar wall faded, they felt the Boutwell move. The boat\u2019s engines roared, and a guard threw open the doors: The sun was setting, and the men were back at sea. For 30 minutes, an hour maybe, they sat in silence, watching the water and the sky become dark, their minds turning to their families. That night, Arcentales and Castillo, the Guatemalan fisherman, both cried, their chests heaving as the other men looked out at the sea.Coast Guard and Southern Command officials, including John Kelly, have argued that if the agency had more ships to deploy, it could interdict four times as much cocaine. \u201cBecause of asset shortfalls, we\u2019re unable to get after 74 percent of suspected maritime drug smuggling,\u201d Kelly said at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in 2014. \u201cI simply sit and watch it go by.\u201d Colombian cocaine production is again on the rise, and while the Coast Guard says it has seized nearly half a million pounds of cocaine over the past year, agency officials have warned as recently as this September that they need more resources to stop the flow.Government officials say intelligence gained from small-time boatmen is key to investigating and dismantling larger transnational criminal networks. The Coast Guard has claimed that between 2002 and 2011, cases against these maritime smugglers helped the government secure three-quarters of its extraditions of Colombian drug kingpins. Affidavits filed more recently in criminal cases against three Mexican and Central American drug leaders, including the notorious cartel leader El Chapo, have noted boat interdictions as small points in larger constellations of evidence. By linking kingpins to boats, prosecutors can add maritime smuggling to the list of charges against them. But the fishermen caught aboard these small smuggling boats, many detained on their first or second run, often have access to mere fragments of information about the people they\u2019re working for. For the most part, men like Arcentales barely know the identity of their recruiter, sometimes just a first name or moniker, and nothing more. \u201cThey are not key widgets in this process,\u201d said Bruce Bagley, a leading scholar on drug smuggling and a professor of political science at the University of Miami. By prosecuting them, he added, \u201cyou don\u2019t slow down the broader operations.\u201dThe cocaine made land long before the detainees. For 44 more days, Arcentales, Quijije, Payan and the Guatemalans were transferred from one ship to the next, passing a week or 10 days on one, a few days on another, always chained to the decks. \u201cI remember one time I asked the nurse officer if he could do me a favor,\u201d Payan wrote later in a letter, \u201cjust shoot me and kill me, I would appreciate, because I cannot take this anymore.\u201d As day after mind-numbing day dragged on, hunger began to rival their families as their central preoccupation. Food logs from Coast Guard ships and testimony from Coast Guard officers show that on some ships, detainees\u2019 meals consisted of only small portions of black beans and rice, on occasion with a bit of spinach or chicken. Arcentales says that he learned to eat slowly, to fool his mind into thinking the plate contained more than it did. The men watched the guards discard their unfinished meals into trash bags hanging nearby and devised a plan. \u201cSomeone would ask to be taken to the restroom so that we could try to reach the trash and take the food,\u201d Quijije said in testimony. They would pass a piece of leftover chicken down the line, each detainee taking a bite and handing it to the next, until the bone was picked clean. After more than two months of detention, Arcentales says, he had lost 20 pounds; Payan says he lost 50. Time began to warp for them. \u201cWe could no longer endure living in such conditions for that prolonged period of time,\u201d Arcentales wrote later in a letter. \u201cIt did not matter to us where they would leave us; we were desperate to communicate with our family.\u201d The Coast Guard and the Department of Justice maintain that all detainees are treated humanely and with accordance to the law. The Coast Guard adds that it shackles detainees and conceals them while in port for their own safety and the safety of the crew.The Coast Guard does not have discretion over where and when to transfer drug-interdiction detainees. Those decisions are made by the Department of Justice, the D.E.A. and federal prosecutors with information from the Coast Guard. Coast Guard officers I spoke to, one of whom was disturbed enough to call the vessels \u201cboat prisons,\u201d say they want detainees removed far more rapidly from their ships, which they acknowledge were never designed to serve as detention centers. Drug Enforcement Administration agents say in court filings that rapid transfers to U.S. soil are logistically impossible, with few countries allowing airport transfers and a shortage of available D.E.A. flights. The Coast Guard says the agency patrols six million square miles, which creates \u201clogistical and transportation challenges.\u201dBut there\u2019s evidence in those court filings that budgetary considerations may also add to the delays. In 2015, a Southern Command official suggested in an email to a D.E.A. agent who was handling a Coast Guard detainee transfer that the agency \u201cmay save costs to the taxpayers\u201d when weighing the benefits of one route back versus another. In an April 2017 brief in a separate case, the government argued that pulling a cutter from normal drug-smuggling patrol to hasten a detainee transfer would be a \u201cconsiderable waste of government resources and time.\u201dCoast Guard ships and frigates on loan from the Navy instead slowly fill up their hangars or decks, waiting to unload detainees when port calls can be arranged with foreign officials and flights arranged with the D.E.A. Other detainees are simply kept aboard cutters as they make trips back to San Diego or through the Panama Canal on the way to East Coast ports. No matter the route, federal judges have repeatedly waived normal protections against extended prearraignment detention, accepting the government\u2019s claims that transferring detainees from the Pacific is too logistically complex to allow for a speedy appearance before a judge. And so over the years federal judges have allowed for progressively longer periods of detainment: five days in the Caribbean in 1985; then 11 in 2006; in 2012, 19 days in the Pacific. Average detention time is now 18 days. An official told me that men have been held up to 90 days.Maritime- and human-rights-law scholars caution that the delayed periods of detention employed by the United States in its antidrug campaign run counter to international human rights norms. \u201cIn a European context, what the U.S. does would not meet the standard,\u201d says Efthymios Papastavridis, a maritime-law scholar at Oxford University. \u201cIt would have to be measured against human rights and due-process law and this would be unlikely to pass the test.\u201dBut Melanie Reid, a former federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice\u2019s Dangerous Narcotics division, said the department\u2019s position was that \u201cthe clock does not start ticking, in the procedural sense, until these people get to the United States and are arrested.\u201d A senior Coast Guard lawyer wrote in a 2016 paper on maritime enforcement and human rights that \u201cno remedy for these delays is generally available to defendants.\u201dWhen she returned home, Mendoza saw that she had missed a series of phone calls from the United States. At 11 the next morning the phone rang again. \u201cI am here,\u201d Arcentales said. \u201cI am alive.\u201d Mendoza cried, overcome by a great swell of relief. \u201cThank God I can hear my family again, thank God you are all O.K.,\u201d Arcentales said.Several days before, the American ship had taken yet another trip to port, this time on the coast of Panama. This time the detainees were told to stand up. Guards unlocked their ankle cuffs and led them off the ship. He would see his family soon, Arcentales thought. Then he heard a guard announce: \u201cGentlemen, D.E.A. agents are waiting for you outside. You are going to the United States.\u201dUnlike domestic arrests, which stipulate that defendants be charged in the jurisdiction of their crime, maritime smugglers can be prosecuted anywhere, as long as it\u2019s the first place they land or in the District of Columbia. American law-enforcement officials have developed a clear preference for prosecuting maritime smuggling cases in Florida, where federal agencies have set up interagency drug-task forces and prosecutors have expertise on maritime drug cases. Trying these cases in Florida may have made practical sense in the 1980s and even the 1990s, when the bulk of maritime interdictions took place in the Caribbean. But now that sea smuggling has shifted significantly to the Pacific, the desire to prosecute defendants in Florida\u2019s federal courts has arguably played a role in the increasingly prolonged maritime detentions.One reason few trials have moved to the West Coast may be that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California, has placed a significant limit on the reach of the U.S. Coast Guard. Unlike courts on the East Coast, the Ninth Circuit requires federal prosecutors to prove that drugs discovered on foreign-registered boats were actually bound for the United States. That decision, in 1994, returned the legal framework in California to something more like the one that existed nationally in the 1980s. Prosecuting smugglers found aboard a foreign-flagged ship without proving their cargo was intended for U.S. markets, the court found, violates Fifth Amendment due-process protections. \u201cWe try not to bring these cases to the Ninth Circuit,\u201d said Aaron Casavant, a Coast Guard lawyer who until 2014 provided legal guidance to the service\u2019s law-enforcement operations and recently wrote a law-review article defending the legal basis of extraterritorial drug enforcement. Casavant points to the fact that there are more lawyers and judges with maritime experience in Florida. But the Justice Department would likely lose a case like Arcentales\u2019s in the Ninth Circuit, where there is a burden of proof. The majority of these cases are tried in the 11th Circuit in Florida, where no such burden exists.Orlando do Campo, a private defense lawyer in Miami, has been assigned by the courts to handle 23 cases of maritime smuggling. \u201cIt\u2019s like a nature documentary where you see the hawk grab the fish out of water, and the fish is there saying, \u2018What the hell am I doing in the air?\u2019\u2009\u201d do Campo said. \u201cFor them that\u2019s Florida. \u2018A few weeks ago, I was in Ecuador, then I went into the middle of the Pacific and now I\u2019m here?\u2019 It\u2019s entirely surreal.\u201dSuch motions, in the rare instances when defense lawyers file them, have little effect. Lawyers for three men whose detention overlapped on a cutter with Arcentales petitioned a federal court to throw out their indictments for \u201coutrageous government conduct.\u201d The judge said he was troubled by detainees\u2019 accounts of \u201cinadequate nutrition, weight loss, lack of privacy for toilet use and lack of sufficient protection from the elements.\u201d Even so, he said, the \u201cinhumane treatment\u201d had not been used \u201cin an effort to secure an indictment,\u201d so he could not dismiss this indictment. \u201cThis is not to say that such treatment of detainees is condoned by this court,\u201d he added. \u201cFar from it.\u201dOn July 2, 2015, Arcentales and Castillo were taken to court for a sentencing hearing. In testimony before Congress this year, John Kelly attested that \u201csuspects from these cases divulge information during prosecution and sentencing that is critical to indicting, extraditing and convicting drug-cartel leadership and dismantling their sophisticated networks.\u201d But the judge presiding in the Arcentales case, Virginia Hernandez Covington, made it clear that the two men were of little use. \u201cThey are just trying to do it to make some money for their family,\u201d Covington said in court. \u201cThe higher up you are, the more information you have. You\u2019re more culpable. But you have more information.\u201d She continued, \u201cThe lower level folks have less information to bargain with.\u201d But defendants charged under the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, even mules like Arcentales, are rarely provided reduced sentences on mandatory minimums, as a suspect caught on U.S. shores with the same quantities of drugs might be. Covington sentenced Arcentales to 10 years in federal prison and Castillo to just over 11.\u201cI had a terrible nightmare about the chains,\u201d Arcentales told me in the visitation room. \u201cI would wake up feeling the chains digging into my ankle and jerk my leg thinking I was shackled, and feel my leg free and be relieved that I was not chained there on the boat. I would wake up sweating; almost crying, thinking I was still chained. Over time it passes. But a thing like this, it never leaves you.\u201dIn the home that Arcentales had left behind, life is no less destitute than when he departed. Two weeks after Arcentales arrived in Florida, Mendoza opened a store in what was once their small sitting area, but it was a good day if it brought in $15. When I met her in Jaramij\u00f3, Mendoza welcomed me warmly into her home, which is crowded with her children and grandchildren and a flow of customers who step inside to buy diapers, plantains or cheese.Wladimir\u2019s court-appointed lawyer, Joaquin Mendez, argued in a federal court in Florida that the 31-day delay between his interdiction and his delivery to court in the United States was a violation of federal statutes requiring that defendants be arraigned within 30 days. \u201cThe Coast Guard made a calculated determination to continue on with their interdiction, to keep these individuals in the conditions that they were, while they\u2019re going about doing their business,\u201d Mendez told Judge James I. Cohn.For what may have been the first time in federal court, Cohn dismissed the indictment against Wladimir because of the delay. \u201cIf government\u2019s argument is taken to its logical extreme, an individual could be detained indefinitely for a federal crime as long as the government did not file a formal complaint,\u201d Cohn said in court. But he threw the case out \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d \u2014 a small embarrassment for federal attorneys, yet one that allowed them to file a new complaint. In late August, Wladimir was sentenced to 10 years.Seth Freed Wessler is an investigative journalist and a Puffin reporting fellow at the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Joomak in Melbourne, Australia", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia FareMELBOURNE, Victoria \u2014 It is hard to argue with barbecue and fried chicken. Those two foods have snaked their way into the Australian restaurant zeitgeist like no other in recent years, as edible Americana has become ubiquitous here. But these two giants of Southern cookery are also culinary emissaries of Korean culture. And as ambassadors go, you can\u2019t get much more charming and irresistible than sizzling meats and crispy chicken served with plenty of beer.There is so much more to Korean food, however, than these greasy darlings, and there are very few places in Melbourne to explore that vast deliciousness. You can get a decent bibimbap here and there, and kimchi shows up on cafe menus almost as often as dukkah these days. Much harder to find are bubbling caldrons of jjigae, turned blazing scarlet from kimchi and chiles, dotted with pork and bulbous clouds of soon tofu.11 PhotosIt was no easy feat: Joomak, opened in 2010, is in the basement of a personality-less Swanston Street office building in Melbourne\u2019s Central Business District, with no street signage indicating that you are in the right location. You enter the building feeling wholly unsure of yourself before descending a flight of stairs that lead to a heavy wooden door. Though the name of the restaurant is above the staircase, and a note on the basement door explains that the business is cash-only, it is not until you step into the room that you are entirely sure you have found the place. It does not help that both map apps on my phone put Joomak down a nearby alley, where I encountered other bewildered would-be customers searching for an entrance between Dumpsters. Use the street address, not the name of the restaurant.Who is cramming into the long, low room, with its booths tucked into nooks along its sides? Mainly young people speaking Korean. They are here for blended sochu and fruit slushies (the pineapple version is best) in pitchers, and unfiltered rice wine on tap, served in metal teakettles and drunk from shallow metal bowls. And they are here for the food that goes with drinking: corn kernels heaped in a pile and smothered in melted cheese; egg rolls stuffed with cheese and fish roe; and yes, spicy pan-fried chicken.I came for the jjigae, listed in English on Joomak\u2019s menu as \u201ckimchi and pork soup with tofu,\u201d presumably because the word \u201cjjigae\u201d has yet to make it into the lexicon of the non-Korean-speaking Australian. It came bubbling in a black caldron, and satiated my lust for piquant, porky comfort. I have certainly had better versions. But Joomak\u2019s kimchi pancake could hang with the best of them, its perfectly greasy crisped crust giving way to a slightly creamy interior, as proficient at soaking up booze as any street pizza. (The seafood pancake is pretty fine, too.) Spicy chicken gizzards, sizzling on a platter, lose their bouncy magic as they cool into rubbery nubs. But those first few bites are fantastic.There is a common theory that Los Angeles\u2019s giant Korean population and Koreatown neighborhood have a strong influence on Korean food culture worldwide. Because America has high-quality beef, one result is more beef-based dishes. You can see that at Joomak in the \u201cL.A.-style short ribs,\u201d cut thin and cooked crispy, the flesh sweet with soy and garlic.Australia has its subtle influences, too. \u201cSchool prawns,\u201d the common bar snack of fried shrimp, are not much different at Joomak than they are at any number of Melbourne pubs, eaten head-on and served with aioli. A dish of kabana sausage stir-fried with vegetables is the ultimate multicultural mash-up \u2014 a Korean take on an Australian version of a Polish sausage.A helpful hint: Call ahead and make a booking. Joomak has one of Melbourne\u2019s rare extremely-late-night licenses, and it is likely you will be taking advantage of those very late hours if you decide to wander in without warning. The efficient, harried staff will take your name and quote a two-to-three-hour wait for a table. There is nowhere in the restaurant to wait. Go drink somewhere else and check back by phone intermittently. Persistence pays off.In Seoul, as in Los Angeles, youth culture and food culture are inextricably intertwined, much like fashion in Tokyo or hip-hop in Atlanta. Ancient methods and ingredients are still respected, but the force that drives the creativity and excitement and revenue for the restaurant industry is food-obsessed millennials. At midnight on Friday nights, Swanston Street is packed with young people of Korean, Vietnamese and Chinese descent, and their energy foretells a Melbourne that is bound to become increasingly influenced by Asian youth culture.Through a door and down some stairs, Joomak is a window into that culture in all its late-night, sochu-soaked vibrancy.Advertisement"}

Its net loss was $443.2 million \u2014 nearly four times the size of the loss a year ago and more than twice as large as what analysts had predicted. About half of that loss was because of the cost of stock-based compensation that the company pays its employees.Snap added 5 million users to its Snapchat messaging service from the previous quarter, but that, too was below estimates from Wall Street, which expected 8 million new users.Snap\u2019s chief executive, Evan Spiegel, said revenue growth had been hurt by the company\u2019s move to automate its ad-buying process. That transition caused ad pricing to drop by about 60 percent from the previous year, he said, though the change is now largely complete.\u201cI am grateful that this transition is nearly behind us,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said on a call with analysts. \u201cThis has been a good test for our business.\u201dMr. Spiegel also said that Snap was redesigning its app to make it easier to use and that the company would focus on user growth in 2018, as well as on content and augmented reality. In the past, Mr. Spiegel has said little about Snap\u2019s product strategy. Unlike many other companies, Snap also does not give an estimate for future revenue in its earnings report.Mr. Spiegel\u2019s talk of goals for 2018 and notes of contrition were a welcome change. For the past two quarters, analysts have expressed frustration over Mr. Spiegel\u2019s unwillingness to give guidance about the company\u2019s product strategy. On stage at a recent conference, Mr. Spiegel said that he needed to do a better job communicating with investors.Snap also indicated it was cutting back on Spectacles, its video recording sunglasses. The company said it had \u201cmisjudged strong early demand for Spectacles\u201d and wrote off $39.9 million of the sunglasses in the quarter.Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said there remained reasons for optimism about Snap and he questioned Wall Street\u2019s focus on user growth.\u201cThe last time I checked this isn\u2019t a subscription business,\u201d he said of Snapchat. \u201cThey\u2019ve done really well retaining their users.

{"Headline": "Life in the Lights", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "Covering a campaign is like taking a photograph through a window. The challenge is to see beyond the reflected image \u2014 what the campaign is trying to project \u2014 and to capture what is really there.I was with Mrs. Clinton on and off during the 2016 campaign and her first presidential run. Her image has always been carefully managed, and our access to behind-the-scenes activity is rare, making it a challenge to capture the candidate in more unguarded moments. I see no point in showing what anyone can see from the audience or on television. For me, a successful campaign photo allows you to step back and give a fuller sense of the scene.I have taken tens of thousands of pictures of Mrs. Clinton and covered her first presidential run. This campaign feels very different from the 2008 race, and I have wanted to make sure our images reflect that.This time around, Mrs. Clinton has shown more confidence as a candidate and seems more energized on the trail. The crowds at her events are far more diverse and much younger than those during her last run \u2014 they look a lot like the ones Barack Obama had in November 2008. Many of the best photos I take of Mrs. Clinton are at the moment she arrives onstage or when she is on the rope line talking to voters. Mrs. Clinton was the front-runner in this race, just as she was in the 2008 campaign. But she seems to have enjoyed this one more.There are a couple of moments that have stuck with me as I covered Mrs. Clinton over the course of her political career. At the Arkansas Governor\u2019s Mansion during the 1992 transition, Mrs. Clinton appeared at a news conference with a group of her husband\u2019s senior advisers. It was a quiet signal that she would wield significant power in his administration, and a hint of her political ambitions.In October 2015, I was at the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, an annual Democratic fund-raiser in Des Moines, where I watched as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s primary opponents took sharp jabs at her for her policy positions and her ties to big banks. But as Mrs. Clinton entered the room, the mood turned from political gathering to rock concert as ecstatic supporters reached across bicycle gates, trying to touch her. Mrs. Clinton was a superstar who was expected to cruise to the nomination and enjoy clear advantages in the general election. But very few people \u2014 possibly including Mrs. Clinton herself \u2014 had an inkling that she was about to take part in the most searing presidential campaign in modern history.I have been photographing Mrs. Clinton since the 1992 presidential campaign, and have spent so much time watching her that I can sometimes predict her gestures and actions at campaign events.While Mrs. Clinton is often described as guarded and hyperaware of how she is perceived, she has frequently projected a sense of ease with who she is during this campaign. She refers to her age unapologetically, often talking about being a grandmother, and seems more comfortable interacting with voters on the trail, at times appearing to take genuine delight in it. Though she rarely deviates from her script, I am always looking for those real and telling moments that show her as a private person rather than just a public figure \u2014 though in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s case, those two roles are deeply intertwined.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Radio Shack Robbery Could Spur a New Era in Digital Privacy", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The case that could transform privacy law in the digital era began with the armed robbery of a Radio Shack store in Detroit, a couple of weeks before Christmas in 2010. In the next three months, eight more stores in Michigan and Ohio were robbed at gunpoint.The robbers took bags filled with smartphones. Their own phones would help send them to prison.Experts in privacy law said the case, Carpenter v. United States, No. 16-402, was a potential blockbuster.In a pair of recent decisions, the Supreme Court expressed discomfort with allowing unlimited government access to digital data. It limited the ability of the police to use GPS devices to track suspects\u2019 movements, and it required a warrant to search cellphones.The court\u2019s decision, expected by June, will apply the Fourth Amendment, drafted in the 18th century, to a world in which people\u2019s movements are continuously recorded by devices in their cars, pockets and purses, by toll plazas and by transit systems. The court\u2019s reasoning may also apply to email and text messages, internet searches, and bank and credit card records.In addition to presenting testimony, prosecutors relied on months of records obtained from cellphone companies to prove their case. The records showed that Mr. Carpenter\u2019s phone had been nearby when several of the robberies happened. He was convicted and sentenced to 116 years in prison.Mr. Carpenter\u2019s lawyers said cellphone companies had turned over 127 days of records that placed his phone at 12,898 locations, based on information from cellphone towers. Prosecutors could tell whether he had slept at home on given nights and whether he attended his usual church on Sunday mornings.Relying on the Smith decision\u2019s \u201cthird-party doctrine,\u201d federal appeals courts have said government investigators seeking data from cellphone companies showing users\u2019 movements also do not require a warrant.Professor Kerr said Congress was better suited than the courts to strike the right balance between the government\u2019s need for information and privacy rights. In Mr. Carpenter\u2019s case, he added, the Fourth Amendment should not apply because there was no search.\u201cModern cellphones are not just another technological convenience,\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the court. Even the word cellphone is a misnomer, he said. \u201cThey could just as easily be called cameras, video players, Rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, libraries, diaries, albums, televisions, maps or newspapers,\u201d the chief justice wrote.But the Riley case concerned information possessed by the person arrested. Mr. Carpenter\u2019s case concerns information held by cellphone companies.All nine justices agreed that this was problematic under the Fourth Amendment, but they were divided on the rationale for the decision. The majority said the police were not entitled to place the device on private property. But five justices in concurring opinions expressed unease with the government\u2019s ability to vacuum up troves of private information.\u201cThe use of longer-term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy,\u201d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for four justices. \u201cSociety\u2019s expectation has been that law enforcement agents and others would not \u2014 and indeed, in the main, simply could not \u2014 secretly monitor and catalog every single movement of an individual\u2019s car for a very long period.\u201dCellphone tower information is not nearly as accurate as that generated by GPS devices, but it is catching up.Mr. Rosen, who favors broad privacy protections, said Mr. Carpenter\u2019s case could transform Fourth Amendment law however the court rules.\u201cIf the court squarely recognizes what it\u2019s been suggesting in recent cases, namely that we do have an expectation of privacy in our digital data and public movements and that the Fourth Amendment prohibits the government from tracking us door to door for weeks in public, that would be an occasion for dancing in the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the court holds that we don\u2019t have an expectation of privacy in public except when there is some sort of physical trespass involved, that could be a huge setback for privacy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghanistan Acts to Ban WhatsApp, but Claims Move Is Temporary", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The Afghan government has moved to temporarily ban WhatsApp, the messaging app that is popular among the country\u2019s elite, angering some users and raising concerns about freedom of expression.Government letters asking private telecommunications companies to suspend WhatsApp as well as Telegram, another encrypted messaging app, began circulating in Afghanistan on social media on Thursday. Late that evening, customers of Salaam Telecom, a government-owned service provider, reported that both apps had stopped working for them.\u201cIt is wrong and illegal,\u201d Abdul Mujeeb Khalvatgar, executive director of Nai, a group that campaigns for free speech, said on Friday. \u201cAccording to the Constitution, freedom of expression is inviolable in Afghanistan. WhatsApp and Telegram are tools of free speech \u2014 if the government bans them, it means that tomorrow they could stand against media in Afghanistan too.\u201dIt was not clear where the decision to ban the apps originated. The letters to the service providers were sent by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. But an official there, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said the request had come from the National Directorate of Security, the country\u2019s intelligence agency.The official said the spy agency had asked the Ministry of Communications to test a 20-day ban on the two apps. He did not provide a reason for the request, but WhatsApp and Telegram are often used by the Taliban and other militant groups to evade government surveillance.But later Friday, the Ministry of Communications gave an entirely different explanation, in what appeared to be a face-saving response to criticism of the ban. It said that the apps were being temporarily banned \u201cto introduce a new kind of technology,\u201d because users had complained about the quality of WhatsApp\u2019s service.The statement also denied that the ban constituted a threat to free expression. \u201cWhatsApp and Telegram are just applications for contact and the sending of audio messages, and this does not affect freedom of speech,\u201d it said.An official at the intelligence agency denied that it had been behind the ban. If the move had been made for security reasons, it would have included other messaging apps like Viber, and it would not have been imposed for just 20 days, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue.Representatives of WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.Ajmal Ayan, a former official with the telecoms regulatory authority, said the government had the legal right to ask service providers to suspend apps if there were \u201clegitimate issues of national security.\u201dBut Mr. Ayan noted that if militants were the intended target of a security-related ban, they could easily find ways around it, like virtual private networks, or VPNs. \u201cThose who want to use WhatsApp and other banned applications, they can technically find other ways of using them,\u201d he said.In 2014, telecom companies refused a government request to ban Facebook during a prolonged election dispute that appeared to threaten Afghanistan\u2019s stability. The government argued that posts on Facebook were worsening the tensions.Mr. Ayan said companies might find it harder to refuse the government\u2019s request this time \u2014 in part because a ban on the messaging apps could increase their revenue, with users forced to make phone calls or send text messages instead of using the free apps.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Parliament Asks Twitter About Russian Meddling in Brexit Vote", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A British lawmaker said on Friday that some of the same Russian-linked Twitter accounts that sought to influence the American presidential election were also deployed in Britain, in the strongest indication yet that Russia used the same tactics on both sides of the Atlantic.Twitter disclosed to the United States Congress this week that it had identified 2,752 accounts affiliated with Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, a notorious troll factory. In a letter to the company, the lawmaker, Damian Collins, wrote that \u201cit has subsequently emerged that some of those accounts were also posting content that relates to the politics of the United Kingdom.\u201dMr. Collins, a Conservative who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into \u201cfake news,\u201d had been presented with screen shots showing the same Russian-linked accounts posting about Britain, his office said Friday.The Brexit process has tied the Conservative government in knots, with cabinet divisions that have badly weakened Prime Minister Theresa May. Any suspicions about Russian interference in the vote would deepen the troubles Mrs. May already faces in rallying her government around a unified stance over Brexit.Although Twitter reaches a relatively small British audience, Russian efforts to use the platform would suggest that its propagandists were also active on Facebook, which has more users and is much harder for those outside the company to monitor.Asked about the claim that accounts linked to Russia had also posted about Britain, a Twitter spokesman declined to comment. But the spokesman said that Twitter would support government investigations into election interference.Russia is eager to weaken or divide the European Union, which it sees as a threat to its influence in Eastern Europe, so it would not be surprising if it were found to have mounted a campaign in favor of Brexit.Facebook said Russia\u2019s internet Research Agency had posted roughly 80,000 pieces of divisive content that was shown to about 29 million people between January 2015 and August 2017, and those posts were then widely shared and reposted to reach far more. The company said it had deleted more than 170 accounts on its photo-sharing app Instagram that had posted about 120,000 pieces of Russia-linked content.That has raised questions about the possibility that a coordinated \u201cbot army\u201d was deployed, and also about the possibility that Twitter itself may have detected and removed them without disclosing the manipulation. Because creating active Twitter accounts can be costly, owners who use them for campaigns typically prefer not to discard them. A spokesman for Twitter has declined to comment.In his letter, Mr. Collins, the chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, asked Twitter for \u201ca list of accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency and any other Russian linked accounts that it has removed and examples of any posts from these accounts that are linked to the United Kingdom.\u201d Mr. Collins asked the company to provide the information by the end of November.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Found the Harbor for Their Hearts", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsThe trip offered spots on 100 boats, with each consisting of friends or family: five women and five men. Jacqueline Spagnola, a native New Yorker, was in her final year of law school. Guido Wolff lived in Amsterdam and was finishing his degree in business hospitality.Both just wanted to hone their boating skills, travel with friends and have a little fun. Neither expected to find a soul mate alongside their shipmates.\u201cGuido and I each got a spot, but since we didn\u2019t know each other we were on different boats,\u201d Ms. Spagnola said. \u201cEven though everyone leaves together, the boats go to different islands at different times during the week.\u201dMs. Spagnola, now 28, met Mr. Wolff, who is 29, on the third day of the trip.\u201cAt any given time, you can have 20 boats docked and tied together and everyone walks from one boat to another,\u201d she said.After hearing loud music that morning, Ms. Spagnola went on deck to see where it was coming from and spotted a group of handsome men two boats from hers.\u201cI was mesmerized by the best-looking guy I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d she said. \u201cI told my friends, \u2018We have to go over there now.\u2019 I quickly retreated to my cabin, did a beauty transformation and went with my friends to Guido\u2019s boat.\u201dMr. Wolff was equally charmed. \u201cShe wore a captain\u2019s hat and a green bikini,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew she was the pretty girl that people wanted to talk to, so I left her a little space.\u201dHours later, the two boats traveled together to the evening activity, which was a party at Fort George, an abandoned castle overlooking the Adriatic Sea. \u201cHer table was next to mine,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cI was so attracted to her. I never lost sight of her.\u201dThey drank and danced, and at midnight they kissed. \u201cI remember looking out onto the crowd, being very happy, and thinking this is exactly where I want to be,\u201d Ms. Spagnola said. \u201cKissing him felt very special.\u201dIt was that kind of special that transcended back to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, where Ms. Spagnola was living while finishing her law degree at Brooklyn Law School. Her mother visited the day after she returned home.\u201cI didn\u2019t think she would meet anyone, it was a singles trip, and she went with friends,\u201d said Victoria Spagnola, 57. \u201cBut she couldn\u2019t stop talking about this man she met. She was 100 percent sure she loved him. She had boyfriends before, but she had never spoken about anyone the way she was speaking about Guido. When she said he was from Amsterdam, I thought, \u2018How are they going to do this? Is it just vacation thing? Who is going to move where?\u2019\u201dAnd thus, problem No. 1: location. Ms. Spagnola grew up in Todt Hill, Staten Island. Her parents also own an apartment in Murray Hill in Manhattan. Her mother is a retired accountant, and her father, Fred Spagnola, 58, is a financial adviser for UBS. She and her brother, who went to school in Manhattan, had strong ties to New York. Moving to Amsterdam for love seemed impulsive.Mr. Wolff grew up in Abcoude, a small town in the Netherlands, until he was 4. Then he moved to Madrid with his older brother and parents. \u201cMy mother was a homemaker and my father was the C.E.O. of a record label,\u201d he said. They returned to his hometown six years later, and by then there were four Wolff children.Still love has a way of steering the ship, so to speak, and after that first kiss, the couple\u2019s course was set.When the night was over, they departed to their separate yachts, hoping they would continue finding each other along the same route and schedule.\u201cI was the captain of our boat and in charge of docking the ship,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d always be looking for hers and park as close to hers as possible. Somehow we end up finding each other at every party.\u201dExcept for the final night, which was filled with mishaps. Each thought the other was going to a specific event and, without cellphone reception, there was no way to connect.\u201cI was so upset I couldn\u2019t find him,\u201d Ms. Spagnola said.Mr. Wolff was at another party looking for her.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any goodbye or closure,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have his phone number. I wasn\u2019t sure how he spelled his first name. All I remembered was Wolff had two Fs.\u201dUpon arriving home, though, she saw that Mr. Wolff had sent her a message on Facebook.\u201cI was really sad about not saying goodbye,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cOn the last day, every boat goes back to their original harbor. Ours weren\u2019t together. When I arrived back in Amsterdam, I looked at Yacht Week\u2019s app, which was connected to Facebook. I went through 500 photos looking for her, none of which had names on them, but I found her.\u201dHis message, according to Ms. Spagnola, read: \u201cIf we didn\u2019t say a proper goodbye, then it wasn\u2019t a goodbye.\u201dShe replied, and phone numbers were exchanged. The next several days turned into a texting frenzy. Then came the phone calls and Skyping. Two months later, Mr. Wolff was visiting her in New York.\u201cYou always have to be cautious with your heart, but I didn\u2019t want any regrets not following it,\u201d he said. \u201cI might as well go and see if she felt the same.\u201dMs. Spagnola did. \u201cWhen I saw him again, I knew I was looking at the man I would marry,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was one of the happiest weeks of my life.\u201dMr. Wolff stayed with Ms. Spagnola for 10 days, during which time they each said \u201cI love you.\u201d The two also went to see a lawyer who informed them about visas, immigration laws and working internationally.Their desire to be with each other superseded the obvious roadblocks.In November 2013, she visited him in the Netherlands, and again for the New Year\u2019s holiday. In March 2014, Mr. Wolff stayed with her for three months. That October, Ms. Spagnola passed the bar and Mr. Wolff visited to celebrate.\u201cThey were so committed to each other from the start,\u201d the bride\u2019s mother said. \u201cIt was true love. You could see it. They looked at each other like no one else was in the room.\u201dBut the couple understood they would not often actually be in the same room, let alone live together full time.\u201cI lived in constant fear we wouldn\u2019t be together,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cThere\u2019s also the fear of not knowing when you\u2019ll see the other person or that you\u2019ll lose them because they\u2019re not in the same city or even the same country with you.\u201dMs. Spagnola felt similarly. \u201cI never knew you could miss someone so much that it caused physical pain,\u201d she said. \u201cGuido had unwavering confidence in us and the value of our love.\u201dIn December 2013, Mr. Wolff obtained a sales job with a denim company that would sponsor him to work in the United States.The couple found an apartment in Williamsburg.On a cold, foggy day in February 2015, while walking on the Brooklyn Promenade, Mr. Wolff dropped to one knee and proposed with a diamond ring he had designed.\u201cEven though we spent so much time being separated, I wanted her to know this was forever,\u201d he said.Things seemed to be going well until that September, when Mr. Wolff, who planned to study for an M.B.A., received a scholarship to Hotelschool The Hague, one of the best hospitality schools in the world, in Amsterdam.He was hesitant to leave. \u201cWhen you only get to be with someone for a week or two at a time, there\u2019s the fear you won\u2019t get a chance to really know them because you\u2019re only seeing them for such short periods,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never got to have a normal rhythm of life. I wasn\u2019t sure leaving would be the best thing for our relationship.\u201dMs. Spagnola refused to let him miss the opportunity. \u201cIt was an 18-month program,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew he couldn\u2019t pass it up, so I really encouraged him to take it. \u201dFor the next four months the couple fell back into a long-distance relationship, each visiting the other monthly. In January 2016, Ms. Spagnola, unable to live without him, found work by persuading a law firm that it needed an international person in its Amsterdam location. Another visa, this time for her, was obtained.\u201cEveryone told me not to go, but I would have regretted not meeting the people who made him the person that I love,\u201d she said.After a year, Ms. Spagnola was unfulfilled with her job. Knowing that Mr. Wolff would return to New York after graduating from school in September, she came home in May 2017. Mr. Wolff was able to secure a job in New York as an account executive at Harver, a Dutch technology company.\u201cEveryone says how great we\u2019ve managed doing a long-distance relationship, but it\u2019s been extremely hard and painful,\u201d Ms. Spagnola said.Eduard Sabbagh, who was part of the groom\u2019s boat and a guest at the wedding, saw the couple\u2019s determination from the beginning. \u201cWithin a week the relationship escalated very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was difficult, but they did it. If Guido sets his mind to something, he\u2019ll figure it out. They\u2019re very similar in that respect.\u201dThe couple were married Oct. 7 before 190 guests at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Manhattan. The Rev. Andrew King, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony.Later in the evening, guest were greeted by two trumpeters in medieval attire at the Metropolitan Club on 60th Street. The couple\u2019s 15 bridesmaids and groomsmen descended the grand stairwell of the club, and then waited as the newly Mr. and Mrs. Wolff entered the reception.\u201cThey were instantly drawn to each other,\u201d said Morgan Manousos, who was on the bride\u2019s boat when the couple first met. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter there was an ocean between them and different continents, they both love fiercely.\u201dIndeed, in the last four years, between the two of them, they have taken the eight-hour flight between New York and Amsterdam more than 35 times.\u201cWe\u2019re both big dreamers,\u201d said the bride, who clutched her husband\u2019s hand before they walked into the dining room for their first dance. \u201cBut he\u2019s here, and we\u2019re here. Today has been better than my wildest dreams. Everybody we love is here. It was the fairy tale wedding I always wanted.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia Inquiry Fails to Unite a Nation", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorIn a buck-stops-with-us moment, they were resolute about doing better. And they were contrite \u2014 even the Fox News founder and chief executive, Roger Ailes, a famous bully who rarely shied from a fight.\u201cWe let our viewers down,\u201d Mr. Ailes said. \u201cIt will not happen again.\u201dThe networks were on the hot seat because their election-night coverage had contributed to the chaos of that shambolic evening. They declared Al Gore the winner in Florida before all of the state\u2019s polls were closed \u2014 and then they called it for George W. Bush, although the results remained in doubt for weeks.In the months that followed, the news organizations agreed on the basic facts, if not on every detail. And under bipartisan pressure from Congress, they moved swiftly to fix their flawed election-night projection system.Look at us now. As the country grapples with a still more serious affront to American democracy, the agreement on the basic facts in the mainstream news media does not extend to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire and other important parts of the conservative media.This is the case even as the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III bears down in his investigation of the alleged Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election.As Mr. Mueller and his team home in on people connected to President Trump, including his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, the president and his allies in the conservative media sphere are pointing at the Democrats and Hillary Clinton.The opacity of the tech companies was matched by the efforts of some conservative media outlets to confuse and distract.In the days leading up to the indictment of Mr. Manafort and his lobbying partner Rick Gates, they saw fit to question Mr. Mueller\u2019s legitimacy. They did so while arguing that the real focus should be on Mrs. Clinton, the Democrats and a political research firm that commissioned the gathering of information on Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, Fusion GPS.The counternarrative was particularly pronounced in the outlets controlled by Mr. Murdoch \u2014 who has close ties to the president\u2019s family \u2014 and his news and entertainment companies, 21st Century Fox and News Corp.Foreshadowing Mr. Goodwin\u2019s dubious argument was an editorial in the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal, which declared that Mr. Mueller \u201clacks the critical distance\u201d to look into the allegation that \u201cDemocrats paid for Russians to compile wild allegations about a U.S. presidential candidate.\u201d The editorial also questioned whether the dossier had triggered the F.B.I. inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.And while skepticism is a virtue in all journalistic endeavors, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the Democrats hired Fusion GPS with the purpose of getting Russians to spread \u201cwild allegations\u201d about Mr. Trump.As John Sipher, a former Central Intelligence Agency chief of station, pointed out, intelligence tends to come from sources within foreign governments.\u201cReaching out to Russians and Americans to try to collect information on what might have happened and then pass that information to sources in good faith, that\u2019s different from trying to conspire with Russia to get stolen emails from the United States,\u201d Mr. Sipher told me.The collective coverage from The Journal editorial page, The New York Post and Fox News \u2014 not including the straight-ahead coverage by the likes of Shepard Smith and Bret Baier \u2014 was testament to the Murdoch empire\u2019s ability to make its own journalistic weather.Between the promotion of alternative narratives and the way the social media platforms have been so slow in describing their inadvertent hosting of the Russian effort, there\u2019s a striking lack of national unity over what appears to have been a foreign incursion in an American election. So you have to wonder how the country will ever come together to do something about it.\u201cThere\u2019s this epic lack of consensus, or active dis-census,\u201d said Shawn Powers, the executive director of the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, who has spent years studying what he calls the \u201cgeopolitics of information.\u201dMr. Powers was confident that, as the facts come out, the country will find a way to fend off similar attacks. For instance, he said, Facebook, Twitter and Google are adding new policies to combat false information, fake accounts and nefarious foreign political advertising.But I can\u2019t help thinking back to 2001.On Tuesday, I called Tom Johnson, the former CNN chairman, who was one of the executives who appeared on Capitol Hill to testify in 2001. He said some colleagues had some qualms appearing before Congress, given the First Amendment implications. But he told me that he had felt it was the right thing to do.\u201cI still think we have the very highest public responsibility to make sure we get it right and, when we don\u2019t get it right, that we try to determine what went wrong and what we can do about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really gets down to operating in the public interest.\u201dOh, yeah, that.Jaclyn Peiser contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

And apparently that\u2019s something a lot of people want to do. I was just flooded with job applicants.Tell us about the cultural phenomenon that ensued when you posted the listing. And people created memes.Justin Trudeau did not apply for the job. This is satire.A 14-year-old version of me is very excited that Al B. Sure! knows my name right now. Actually, current me is very excited that Al B. Sure! knows my name right now. But things like this have no bearing on whether you get the job, because I didn\u2019t ask everyone to submit a celebrity friend video.So obviously everyone who ever dreamed of spending a year traveling the world applied for this job. Tell us a little about their backgrounds. I was really heartened by the wide variety of people who applied. We got a lot of people who don\u2019t have a traditional background for being a reporter for The Times. First of all, a lot of baristas applied.We got a lot of people from tech companies. We got somebody who used to be a coal miner and was trying to become a travel photographer. We got a lot of teachers \u2014 a lot of history teachers. We also got flight attendants, probably because they like to travel and don\u2019t get to do it at a slower pace.Actors, actresses, we got some models, a mechanic writing from Russia, an airplane refueler. We got a physics professor, a dance professor.We got a lot of writers who are really great feature writers. We got a lot of applicants who were photographers or make documentaries.We also got a lot of people who work in television. We got a lot of people who work in broadcast television, anchors or hosts. A lot of people who work on sports too \u2014 a lot of people who cover sports, a lot of anchors, a lot of producers.With 9,000 applications, how did you manage to evaluate everyone?We looked at every single one of them, I\u2019m proud to say. There was a team of four of us and we set up sessions. We divided up the list, created these immense spreadsheets with titles, positions, experience skills, and scanned the spreadsheets. If anything jumped out at us, we would dive into the application material to find out about the person.That yielded a lot of surprises. A lot of people who I wouldn\u2019t expect to be good at writing and putting together a story were actually good at it.What are you looking for in this travel writer?The qualifications are quite broad because I wanted to make sure that people who applied were not just travel journalists and not just writers, but people who are really good at visual storytelling.I\u2019m looking for someone who loves travel. We got a little pushback at one point for asking for someone who has travel experience. Even though travel seems fun, working and writing while you\u2019re traveling is actually a job and it\u2019s a skill that you get better at over time. I\u2019m looking for someone who can really parachute into a place, get to know what it\u2019s like, share with our readers and viewers what it\u2019s like on social media, using video, using images; someone who can write a piece that appears on our site and in print as well.Where are you in the process? We are now sort of narrowing down and selecting the top candidates. For the top candidates, we\u2019re thinking of choosing more along the lines of 100, rather than just 10 or so. We\u2019ll be reaching out to those people for the next couple of weeks, just asking for more information and asking questions.We\u2019re also trying to figure out how to engage all of the applicants, regardless of whether they make the cut, trying to figure out how to engage them in the trip and get their perspective. I\u2019ll have some updates on that going forward.After we reach out to everybody, we\u2019re going to announce our selection. I\u2019m calling it informally \u2014 in house \u2014 the traveler job.

They were headed for 10 years in jail!\u201dThe players did thank Trump, among many others.\u201cTo President Trump and the United States government, thank you for taking time to intervene on our behalf,\u201d Riley said.The players also thanked the Chinese police for treating them with respect.\u201cThese are good young men who exercised an inexcusable lapse of judgment,\u201d Alford said.No questions were taken after the news conference.The news conference was the first time players or staff members at U.C.L.A. had commented significantly on last week\u2019s incident. The university had been mostly closed-lipped on the matter while the players were detained. Alford said that the team had been advised that speaking about it could have jeopardized the players returning home.The players were arrested on Nov. 8, accused of stealing designer sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton store in Hangzhou. The team was in the country to play an exhibition against Georgia Tech. Playing without the three freshmen, U.C.L.A. won, 63-60, in Shanghai on Friday.The players were detained at their hotel in Hangzhou for most of the week as their teammates flew home. On Tuesday, the three players were allowed to board a flight back to California.\u201cAn awful lot of American kids don\u2019t realize that the kinds of things that in United States society we tolerate with a slap on the wrist, a lot of countries they take very seriously,\u201d John F.

She cast her eyes down as the hymn \u201cJerusalem My Happy Home\u201d swelled around her.As the words \u201cHosanna in the highest!\u201d echoed in the cathedral, she never looked up. That is, until she finished buying a pair of black boots off the internet on her iPhone.But during Sunday Mass at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, it seemed either the pontiff\u2019s message had not yet reached across the Atlantic or the churchgoers were not listening.Beside a font of holy water, tourists took in the Mass via the screens of their phones, some mounted on selfie sticks. By the entrance, devotees stood praying, but every so often phone-holding hands would pop up above the crowd to snap a picture. One man stood in the back, hunched in what appeared to be deep devotion \u2014 to select the perfect photo filter for his picture of the cathedral\u2019s eaves.In the pews, most people pored over the missals. But a surreptitious few checked email, planting their phone between the pages of the Psalms. One woman strode boldly through the nave as the organ played, her earbuds in, video chatting all the while.\u201cIt\u2019s probably a trend they should embrace,\u201d said Edward Zhong, 25, a doctor visiting from Australia with his brother Mark, 21, who spent much of the homily taking pictures. Dr. Zhong suggested the church might go so far as create an app for use during Mass. \u201cThey probably could access a greater demographic \u2014 people who are born with an iPhone in their hand.\u201dJoseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, said that some churches already offer apps, a trend he does not approve. \u201cThere are enough occasions for our mind to wander during Mass; we shouldn\u2019t be using these artificial things that take us away,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat happens when you have your phone out? It buzzes, you get a text, you get a Facebook update, you get a notification. Suddenly, you\u2019re not thinking about what\u2019s happening in the Mass\u201d Mr. Zwilling added. \u201cThat\u2019s the real danger of having your phone.\u201dThe archdiocese, as well as the Vatican, regularly broadcast Mass and other services. Watching sermons beamed from St. Patrick\u2019s as a boy was why Sergio Sandoval, 63, had been drawn to visit the cathedral all the way from Dallas on Sunday, with his wife, Norma, 56. Even after learning of the pope\u2019s displeasure, the Sandovals were uncertain what the difference was between the two types of filming \u2014 official recordings and their own smartphone clips.\u201cI wanted to record the organ, it\u2019s so powerful,\u201d said Mr. Sandoval, who runs a day care center with his wife. He had planned to play the recording back home for one of his sons, a preacher. He didn\u2019t mind that the pontiff disapproved. \u201cI\u2019d still probably do it.\u201dThough firmly of the internet generation at 16 years old, Joseph Kelley, a visitor from Bluffton, S.C., said he wouldn\u2019t dare use his phone in church. At his home church, his priest discourages even following along in the Bible, lest reading distract from the moment, he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about taking a picture,\u201d Joseph said, \u201cyou\u2019re not really focused on the feelings.\u201dDespite all the selfie-taking at the Fifth Avenue church on Sunday, an anti-phone sentiment seemed to predominate, and it cut across faiths.

But They\u2019re Still Easy to Spot.", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Executives of Facebook, Twitter and Google pledged to Congress this week to do more to prevent the fakery that has polluted their sites. \u201cWe understand that the people you represent expect authentic experiences when they come to our platform,\u201d Colin Stretch, the general counsel of Facebook, told the Senate Intelligence Committee. He said the company was doubling its review staff to 20,000 and using artificial intelligence to find more \u201cbad actors.\u201dDespite months of talk about the problem of fraud facing Facebook and other tech companies, and vows to root it out, their sites remain infected by obvious counterfeits. The Russian influence operation during the 2016 election, which occasioned the three congressional hearings this week, is only one especially consequential sample of a far larger problem, in which the platforms are gamed for profit or political influence.Conswriters.com, like hundreds of \u201cclickbait\u201d sites, pastes enticing headlines on articles that read like the work of time-pressed high school students. But it is packed with Google ads that generate revenue for every click, highlighting Google\u2019s foundational role in the ecosystem of online deception.Jonathan L. Zittrain, who studies the internet and society at Harvard, said the companies are reluctant to aggressively purge bogus users and deceptive content because of their business model, which is built on signing up more and more people.\u201cThese platforms are oriented to maximize user growth and retention,\u201d Mr. Zittrain said. \u201cThat means not throwing up even tiny hurdles along the sign-up runway, and not closing accounts without significant cause. I suspect they figure there are enough accounts that are the subject of complaints to review without looking for more to assess.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how sloppy some of these accounts are,\u201d Mr. Elwood said. \u201cI hate liars and I\u2019m drawn to understand stuff like this.\u201d______Red Flags: How to Spot Fake ContentCheck out who a profile is \u201cfriends\u201d with. Is the hometown listed on a profile similar to its friend base? For example, \u201cKeven Eversley\u201d claims to be from Minneapolis, but the majority of his friends are from Skopje, Macedonia.Compare the profile\u2019s public name to its web address. For the Eversley profile, it has a different name in the address: Aleksandar Teovski.If a profile seems suspicious, search for similar pages that draw on the same personal details or images.______\u201cThe reporting process is frustrating,\u201d Mr. Elwood said. \u201cFacebook seems to be lagging way behind the problem.\u201dFacebook estimates that as many as 60 million accounts, 2 to 3 percent of the company\u2019s 2.07 billion regular visitors, are fakes. Sean Edgett, Twitter\u2019s general counsel, testified before Congress that about 5 percent of its 330 million users are \u201cfalse accounts or spam,\u201d which would add up to more than 16 million fakes.\u201cSpammers and bad actors are getting better at making themselves look more real,\u201d Mr. Edgett said.Independent experts say the real numbers are far higher.On Twitter, little more than an email address is needed to start tweeting. Facebook\u2019s requirement that users be their authentic selves means the company asks for a smattering of information to sign up \u2014 name, birthday, gender and email address. But few checks exist to verify that information.\u201cPart of the problem is that Facebook is a black box,\u201d said Michael Serazio, a professor of communications at Boston College. \u201cThey do what they do, and we don\u2019t know to what degree their operations can even handle these issues \u2014 not to mention how handling them maps with their economic model.\u201dIn fact, fighting too hard against deception may clash with the business models that have allowed the companies to thrive. Facebook, Google and Twitter all offer self-serve advertising systems allowing anyone in the world to buy, target and deliver ads for as much \u2014 or as little \u2014 money as they wish to spend. More scrutiny could hamper growth.\u201cProtecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d he said.Whether public concern about the manipulation of the platforms might at some point threaten the business remains to be seen. But many customers who run up against the fakery problem end up unhappy.Kristofer Goldsmith, an assistant director for policy and government relations at Vietnam Veterans of America, noticed last summer a look-alike Facebook page calling itself Vietnam Vets of America that initially borrowed the real group\u2019s logo. Linked to a website hosted in Bulgaria, the upstart page pushed viral content, weighing in on N.F.L. players\u2019 protests of police shootings. It posted looping videos that were months or years old but presented them as breaking news, he said.\u201cSometimes their grammar was off,\u201d Mr. Goldsmith said, but there was no way to know who was behind the page.Soon, the look-alike page had 200,000 followers \u2014 more than the 120,000 than the page of the real group, which has a long history of service, a congressional charter and chapters around the country. Mr. Goldsmith said the linked website had few ads, so he suspected a political motive, probably in line with the Russian campaign to divide Americans.In August, Mr. Goldsmith began complaining to Facebook. But officials there hesitated; hosting pages for millions of groups, they were hardly equipped to assess in detail whether a particular veterans group was worthy and another was not.Finally, in late October, Facebook shut the newer page, deciding it had illicitly stolen the intellectual property of the older page. But Mr. Goldsmith said the experience was disturbing.\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re taking a very proactive approach,\u201d he said of Facebook. \u201cThere was a foreign entity targeting American vets and inserting itself into divisive debates. Someone could do this to us every month.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated at one point Facebook\u2019s most recent report of its monthly average users. The correct number is 2.07 billion, not 2.3 billion. That earlier version also misstated how many users Facebook estimates are fakes. The company estimates that 10 percent of its accounts, or 200 million, are duplicates used by real people, and that 60 million accounts are fake.Lilia Chang contributed to this article.Advertisement"}

Unless you have a dietary restriction, in which case it might lack something you can actually eat.What every modern Thanksgiving table needs is one great dish that anyone can eat. It should be satisfying and hearty enough to be a meal on its own, but appealing enough to share as a side dish.This golden-topped casserole of wild rice, white beans and seared mushrooms fits the bill.The white beans, some of which are pur\u00e9ed, give it creaminess, while the wild rice adds a robust, chewy texture. The combination of mushrooms, leeks and fennel makes it autumnal. And plenty of saut\u00e9ed spinach not only helps lighten the starchiness of the beans and rice, but also adds some necessary color.Like many casseroles, this one is adaptable so you can tailor it to your tastes and your crowd. You can use gluten-free panko for celiac friends, or leave off the Parmesan in the topping for vegans and the lactose-intolerant. If you can\u2019t get, or don\u2019t want to spring for, the pricey wild rice, brown rice makes an equally nubby substitute. Cilantro haters can substitute basil.One thing to keep in mind is that canned beans vary a lot in terms of salt content. If possible, find a brand that lists sea salt as an ingredient. These tend to have a better flavor than unsalted beans. But in either case, taste as you go, adjusting the salt as you see fit.Conveniently for Thanksgiving (or any other dinner party), you can assemble the components for this dish the day before you want to serve it. Store the filling and topping separately in the fridge. Just before baking, spread the crumbs over the casserole and bake until steaming hot inside and golden on top.Then serve it to your loved ones, because this is a dish they all can love.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Myanmar Is Not a Simple Morality Tale", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAYPYIDAW, Myanmar \u2014 As world capitals go, this is one of the weirdest. Six-lane highways with scarcely a car on them could serve as runways. The roads connect concealed ministries and vast convention centers. A white heat glares over the emptiness. There is no hub, gathering place or public square \u2014 and that is the point.Military leaders in Myanmar wanted a capital secure in its remoteness, and they unveiled this city in 2005. Yangon, the bustling former capital, was treacherous; over the decades of suffocating rule by generals, protests would erupt. So it is in this undemocratic fortress, of all places, that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, long the world\u2019s champion of democracy, spends her days, contemplating a spectacular fall from grace: the dishonored icon in her ghostly labyrinth.Perhaps because she sees something else above all: that Myanmar is not a democracy. It\u2019s a quasi democracy at best, in delicate transition from military rule, a nation at war with itself and yet to be forged. If she cannot walk the fine line set by the army, all could be lost, her life\u2019s work for freedom squandered. This is no small thing. Not to recognize her dilemma \u2014 as the West has largely failed to do so since August \u2014 amounts to irresponsible grandstanding.The problem is with what the West wants her to be. Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general who delivered a report on the situation in Rakhine State, in western Myanmar, just as the violence erupted there, told me that people in the West were incensed about Aung San Suu Kyi because, \u201cWe created a saint and the saint has become a politician, and we don\u2019t like that.\u201dCertainly Aung San Suu Kyi has appeared unmoved. She has avoided condemning the military for what the United Nations has called a \u201chuman rights nightmare.\u201d She shuns the word \u201cRohingya,\u201d a term reviled by many in Myanmar\u2019s Buddhist majority as an invented identity. Her communications team has proved hapless, and opacity has become a hallmark of her administration as she has shunned interviews. At a rare appearance with Tillerson at the Foreign Ministry here, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why people say that I\u2019ve been silent.\u201d It\u2019s untrue, she insisted. \u201cI think what people mean is that what I say is not interesting enough. But what I say is not meant to be exciting, it\u2019s meant to be accurate. And it\u2019s aimed at creating more harmony.\u201d\u201cHarmony\u201d is a favorite expression of hers, as is \u201crule of law.\u201d Both lie at a fantastic distance from the reality in Myanmar. It is a fragmented country still confronting multiple ethnic insurgencies and \u201calways held together by force,\u201d as Derek Mitchell, a former American ambassador, told me. Since independence from British imperial rule in 1948, the army, known as the Tatmadaw, has ruled most of the time, with ruinous consequences.In many respects, the military continues to rule. When her National League for Democracy won the 2015 election, Aung San Suu Kyi did not become president. The world rejoiced \u2014 and glossed over this detail. The 2008 Constitution, crafted by the military, bars her from the presidency because she has children who are British citizens. So she labors under the contrived honorific of state counselor. The Ministries of Defense, Home Affairs and Border Affairs \u2014 all the guns \u2014 remain under military control, as do the National Defense and Security Council and 25 percent of all seats in Parliament.This was not a handover of power. It was a highly controlled, and easily reversible, cession of partial authority.Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s decisions must be seen in this context. She is playing a long game for real democratic change. \u201cShe is walking one step by one step in a very careful way, standing delicately between the military and the people,\u201d said U Chit Khaing, a prominent businessman in Yangon. Perhaps she is playing the game too cautiously, but there is nothing in her history to suggest she\u2019s anything but resolute.The problem is she\u2019s a novice in her current role. As a politician, not a saint, it must be said that Aung San Suu Kyi has proved inept. This is scarcely surprising. She lived most of her life abroad, was confined on her return, and has no prior experience of governing or administering.You don\u2019t endure a decade and a half of house arrest, opt not to see your dying husband in England and endure separation from your children without a steely patriotic conviction. This is her force, a magnetic field. It can also be blinding. \u201cMother Suu knows best,\u201d said David Scott Mathieson, an analyst based in Yangon. \u201cExcept that she\u2019s in denial of the dimensions of what happened.\u201dThe hard grind of politics is foreign to her. Empathy is not her thing. Take her to a refugee camp; she won\u2019t throw her arms around children. She sees herself as incarnating the inner spirit of her country, a straight-backed Buddhist woman with a mission to complete what her father, whom she lost when she was 2, set out to do: unify the nation. Yet the road to that end remains vague. Even Myanmar\u2019s ultimate identity \u2014 a Buddhist state dominated by her own ethnic Bamar majority or a genuinely federalist, multireligious union \u2014 remains unclear. Her voice is absent.Could she, short of the military red lines that surround her, have expressed her indignation at the immense suffering of Rohingya civilians, and condemned the arson and killing that sent hundreds of thousands of terrified human beings on their way? Perhaps. But that would demand that she believes this is the essence of the story. It\u2019s unclear that she does; she\u2019s suspicious of the Rohingya claims and what she sees as manipulation of the media. It would also demand that she deem the political risk tolerable in a country that overwhelmingly supports her in her stance. Certainly she did not order the slaughter. Nor did she have the constitutional powers to stop it.In Rakhine State, where all hell broke loose last August, the poverty is etched in drawn faces with staring eyes. The streets of its capital, Sittwe, a little over an hour\u2019s flight from Yangon, are dusty and depleted. Its beach is overrun with stray dogs and crows feeding on garbage. As the town goes, so goes all of Rakhine, now one of the poorest parts of Myanmar, itself a very poor country. The violence that ripped through the northern part of the state was a disaster foretold.There was an earlier eruption, in 2012, when intercommunal violence between Rakhine Buddhists and Muslims left close to 200 people dead and about 120,000 people marooned in camps. There they have rotted for five years. Government promises have yielded nothing. The camps are closed off. Former Rohingya districts in town have been emptied, a shocking exercise in ghettoization.I spoke by phone with Saed Mohamed, a 31-year-old teacher confined since 2012 in a camp. \u201cThe government has cheated us so many times,\u201d he told me. \u201cI have lost my trust in Aung San Suu Kyi. She is still lying. She never talks about our Rohingya suffering. She talks of peace and community, but her government has done nothing for reconciliation.\u201dRakhine, also called Arakan, was an independent kingdom before falling under Burmese control in the late 18th century. Long neglect from the central government, the fruit of mutual suspicion, has spawned a Rakhine Buddhist independence movement, whose military wing is the Arakan Army. \u201cWe are suffering from 70 years of oppression from the government,\u201d Htun Aung Kyaw, the general secretary of the Arakan National Party, whose objective is self-determination for the region, told me.The steady influx over a long period of Bengali Muslims, encouraged by the British Empire to provide cheap labor, exacerbated Rakhine Buddhist resentments. The Muslim community has grown to about one-third of Rakhine\u2019s population of more than 3.1 million and, over time, its self-identification as \u201cRohingya\u201d has become steadily more universal.Within Myanmar, this single word, \u201cRohingya,\u201d resembles a fuse to a bomb. It sets people off. I could find hardly anybody, outside the community itself, even prepared to use it; if they did they generally accompanied it with a racist slur. The general view is that there are no Rohingya. They are all \u201cBengalis.\u201dU Nyar Na, a Buddhist monk, seemed a picture of serenity, seated at the window of a Sittwe monastery beside magenta robes hanging on a line. But when our conversation turned to the Rohingya, he bristled.\u201cThe whole problem lies in that word; there are no Rohingya among the 135 ethnic groups in Myanmar,\u201d he told me, alluding to the indigenous peoples listed in connection with the country\u2019s 1982 citizenship law. \u201cThis is not an existing ethnic group \u2014 they just created it. So if they believe it, the belief is false.\u201dHe reached down for his smartphone, and found an internet image supposedly representing the secessionist plans of the \u201cBengali Muslims.\u201d It showed Rakhine, shaded green, under the words: \u201cSovereign State of Rahamaland, an independent state of Rohingya people.\u201d He looked at me as if to say, there, you see, empirical proof of their diabolical intent.Such fears run deep. Aung San Suu Kyi is inevitably sensitive to them. A combination of more than a century of British colonial subjugation, the looming presence of China to the east and India to the west, with their 2.7 billion people (Myanmar has 54 million), and its own unresolved internal ethnic conflicts have marked the national psyche with a deep angst over sovereignty. U Ko Ko Gyi, a politician long imprisoned by the military but now in full support of the army\u2019s actions in Rakhine, told me, \u201cOur in-bone conviction from our ancestors is to resist outside pressure and fight until the last breath to survive.\u201dMyanmar, with its bell-shaped golden pagodas dotting the landscape, shimmering in the liquid light, often seems gripped these days by a fevered view of itself as the last bastion of Buddhism, facing down the global advance of Islam in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and elsewhere. The Rohingya have come to personify these fears.Many conversations here reminded me of my time covering the Balkan wars of the 1990s when Serbs, in the grip of a nationalist paroxysm, often dismissed the enemy \u2014 Bosnian Muslims, Kosovo Albanians \u2014 as nonexistent peoples. But as Benedict Anderson observed, all nations are \u201cimagined communities.\u201d The Rohingya exist because they believe they exist.It does not matter when exactly the name was coined \u2014 dispute rages on this question \u2014 or when exactly the Muslims of Rakhine embraced it in their overwhelming majority. Nothing is more certain to forge ethno-national identity than oppression. By making Rakhine Muslims stateless \u2014 by granting them identity cards of various hues that at various times seemed to confer citizenship or its promise only to withdraw them \u2014 and by subjecting them to intermittent violence, the military of Myanmar and its Rakhine Buddhist militia sidekicks have done more than anyone to forge a distinct Rohingya identity.Out of such desperation emerged the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, or ARSA, the Rohingya insurgent group whose attacks on several police outposts close to the Bangladeshi border on Aug. 25 ignited a devastating military response. A persecuted people will take up arms. When you attempt to destroy a people you don\u2019t believe exists, fury may get the upper hand.In September, with hundreds of thousands of Rohingya already displaced in camps in Bangladesh, Aung San Suu Kyi told The Nikkei Asian Review she was puzzled as to why the exodus had continued after military operations slowed. She speculated: \u201cIt could be they were afraid there might be reprisals. It could be for other reasons. I am genuinely interested because if we want to remedy the situation, we\u2019ve got to find out why \u2014 why all the problems started in the first place.\u201dHer tone, weirdly academic, seemed almost plaintive. The problems started because of an abject failure over decades. Military governments failed Rakhine Buddists; they failed Rakhine Rohingya even more, their policy laced through with racism. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s own government has prolonged that failure. The arson, killing and rape followed. This should be clear.It\u2019s less clear what should be done now. More than half a million terrorized people find themselves homeless. Bangladesh and Myanmar announced an agreement last week to begin returning displaced people within two months, but details were murky. Repatriation is urgent, but contentious, and will be meaningless unless Myanmar lays out an unambiguous and consistent path to citizenship, or at least legal residency, for the Rohingya, who today constitute some 10 percent of all the world\u2019s stateless people. Denying the possibility of citizenship to people resident in Myanmar for a long time is unworthy of the democracy Aung San Suu Kyi wants to forge as her last legacy.This Burmese transition to democracy stands on a knife-edge. Its ultimate success is of critical importance, with forms of authoritarianism ascendant the world over. Criminal actions should be punished under the \u201crule of law\u201d Aung San Suu Kyi cites so often. But the sanctions being called for by more than 20 senators and by groups including Human Rights Watch, and even the targeted individual sanctions envisaged by the State Department, would undermine an already parlous economy, entrench the Burmese in their sense of being alone against the world and render any passage to full democracy even harder.The country is now in the sights of jihadist groups enraged by the treatment of the Rohingya. Already there is an ugly and significant movement of extremist Buddhist monks. Pope Francis, who plans to visit Myanmar this week, faces a delicate task in trying to advance conciliation. His first quandary will be whether to use the word \u201cRohingya,\u201d which the Annan report avoided, in line with the request of Aung San Suu Kyi. (She believes that both \u201cRohingya\u201d and \u201cBengali\u201d are needlessly provocative.) He should. The Rohingya exist, have suffered, and through suffering have arrived at an identity that is unshakable.Now in her 70s, Aung San Suu Kyi has to find her voice. Harmony is all very well, but meaningless without creative, energetic politicking. She knows she can\u2019t throw the military under the bus if she wants to complete what she began through her brave defiance of the army in 1988. The world should understand this, too. It might better focus on Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief who presided over a ludicrous military report on the atrocities that exonerated the army. Tillerson rightly demanded an independent inquiry. Taking down Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s portrait is easy for people in comfortable places who have never faced challenges resembling hers.In her book \u201cLetters from Burma,\u201d Aung San Suu Kyi wrote of the suffering of Burmese children: \u201cThey know that there will be no security for their families as long as freedom of thought and freedom of political action are not guaranteed by the law of the land.\u201dThe work of removing, once and for all, that anxiety from all the inhabitants of Myanmar and establishing the rule of law is far from done, as the devastating violence in Rakhine has amply illustrated. But Aung San Suu Kyi, a woman who faced down guns, remains the best hope of completing the task. Turning saints into ogres is easy. Completing an unfinished nation, clawing it from the military that has devastated it, is far more arduous \u2014 the longest of long games.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Orders Its Citizens Out of Lebanon, Raising Fears of War", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Saudi Arabia ordered its citizens to leave Lebanon on Thursday, escalating a bewildering crisis between the two Arab nations and raising fears that it could lead to an economic crisis or even war.The developments plunged Lebanon into a state of national anxiety, with politicians, journalists and even parents picking up their children at school consumed with the question of what could come next.While analysts said a war was unlikely \u2014 because Saudi Arabia was not capable of waging one and Israel did not want one now \u2014 they worried that with so many active conflicts in the region, any Saudi actions that raised the temperature increased the risk of an accidental conflagration.\u201cThere are so many fuses, so little communication, so many risks of something exploding, that there\u2019s little chance of something not going wrong,\u201d said Robert Malley, the former director of Middle East policy in the Obama White House and now vice president for policy at the International Crisis Group. \u201cEverything needs to go right to maintain calm.\u201dDespite the worries, analysts, officials and diplomats said that although they were not privy to the thinking of the Saudi crown prince, it was far-fetched that Saudi Arabia would launch a military action against Lebanon, since it is already overstretched in a war it started two years ago against Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen.And Saudi Arabia has expressed displeasure with Lebanon this way before: This was at least the fourth time in five years that it asked its citizens to leave Lebanon.But even before the current crisis, fears were building in Lebanon that Israel \u2014 which shares Saudi Arabia\u2019s goal of rolling back Iranian power \u2014 would instigate another war against Hezbollah to curtail the increased power, influence and weaponry the Lebanese group has accumulated while playing a decisive role in the war in neighboring Syria.Several Israeli officials seized on Mr. Hariri\u2019s resignation \u2014 which he attributed to Iranian interference \u2014 as proof that Hezbollah, Iran and the Lebanese government were one and the same. That has fueled anxiety even as both Israel and Hezbollah insist that while they are prepared for a war, they do not want one now.Reaction in Washington on Thursday to Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to order its citizens out of Lebanon was also cautious.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re on the brink of war, but it certainly constitutes an escalation,\u201d said Andrew Exum, a former top Middle East policy official at the Pentagon, said in a telephone interview.The question was whether heightened tensions would start one anyway.Israeli officials, while cheering Prince Mohammed\u2019s tough line on Iran, said they were uncertain that the crown prince was experienced or adroit enough to avoid setting off a broader regional conflict, perhaps one that could drag Israel in.\u201cIsrael has two objectives: to stop Iran\u2019s path towards dominance and hegemony in the region, and to create an alliance of the rational players in the region that would include Israel,\u201d said Naftali Bennett, the Israeli minister of education and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s security cabinet. \u201cThat is certainly a positive development to have such an alignment. At the same time, we have to be very cautious to prevent an unnecessary escalation in the region.\u201dDaniel B. Shapiro, a former United States ambassador to Israel, said more bluntly that it was one thing for Israel to see eye to eye with Saudi Arabia about who their adversaries were, \u201cbut it\u2019s another to let a young, impulsive leader set the pace, when he won\u2019t have to do all the fighting.\u201dSome analysts suggested the Saudi escalation in Lebanon was less about making a dent in Hezbollah\u2019s power and more a distraction from what appears to be a political purge at home and largely failed attempts to counter Iran in Syria and Yemen abroad. The developments fueled speculation that Prince Mohammed might be positioning himself to announce his accession to the throne.\u201cMaybe he felt he could score easier points in Lebanon and say internally, \u2018Look, I\u2019m being tough against Hezbollah,\u2019 \u201d said Michael Young, a Lebanese analyst. \u201cAll this suggests to me that the arrival of King Mohammed is going to be sooner than later.\u201dRather than war, analysts say Saudi Arabia\u2019s next steps against Lebanon may be economic, like the boycott and blockade Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies are conducting against Qatar.Saudi Arabi and its allies could expel Lebanese citizens, close air routes, cut off diplomatic relations and demand that Hezbollah be thrown out of government or forced to disarm, the political blogger Elias Muhanna wrote.Those measures would be likely to hurt Hezbollah least, since unlike other parties and ordinary Lebanese, it can draw on extensive financial support from Iran.But none of that was reassuring to people in Lebanon, a country of about 6.2 million people that for most its history has been batted between regional and global powers, most recently between Saudi Arabia and Iran, that exploit its own internal divisions. The country survived a devastating war in 2006 when Hezbollah fought Israel to a draw.His political party, the Future Movement, stopped short of publicly agreeing with Hezbollah and its ally, President Michel Aoun, that Mr. Hariri was a hostage. But it issued a statement implying he was not operating under his own free will, referring to him as still being the prime minister.His return \u201cis necessary to restore dignity and respect to Lebanon,\u201d the statement said, stressing its support for his leadership and vowing \u201cto follow him in whatever he decides.\u201dMr. Hariri, a dual citizen of Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, met the ambassadors of Britain and the European Union and the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires from the American Embassy on Wednesday and Thursday at his Riyadh residence. Other Western diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that those envoys, too, came away with the impression that he could not speak freely.The American ambassador to Lebanon, Elizabeth Richards, posted photographs of a meeting with Lebanese Army officials and emphasized international support for the Lebanese government.But President Trump in recent days has posted on Twitter messages of unspecified support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s rulers, saying they \u201cknow exactly what they are doing.\u201dLebanon tried to handle the stress with its customary mix of jitters and jadedness. People debated whether to stock up on canned food for a coming war, but also ratcheted up the black humor.\u201cSaudi Arabia should pay for our therapy,\u201d Karim Traboulsi, an editor at the news site The New Arab, wrote in a post on Facebook.Reporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad and Nada Homsi from Beirut; David M. Halbfinger from Jerusalem; and Eric Schmitt from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "4 More Women Accuse Roy Moore of Misconduct", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGADSDEN, Ala. \u2014 Alabama\u2019s increasingly bizarre Senate race was convulsed again as four more women came forward on Wednesday to describe encounters with the Republican candidate, Roy S. Moore, and Mr. Moore\u2019s campaign sharply questioned the credibility of another accuser.The newest accusations came from women who ranged in age from about 18 to 28 at the time. They complained of being groped, forcibly kissed or subjected to unwanted advances.One of them, Becky Gray, now 62, a retired teacher living in Gadsden, Ala., said in an interview that she was puzzled by Mr. Moore\u2019s repeated overtures when she worked in the Gadsden Mall.\u201cI just couldn\u2019t figure out why a man of his age spent every Friday and Saturday at the mall,\u201d said Ms. Gray, who was then in her late teens or early 20s.She said she frequently saw Mr. Moore, then in his 30s, talking with young women and did her best to avoid him. Ms. Gray said she eventually complained to her manager that he would not leave her alone and was later told that Mr. Moore had been banned from the mall.Nine women have now come forward with accusations, and state Republican leaders were pondering increasingly baroque mechanisms that have the potential to deny their own candidate a Senate seat. Party leaders met Wednesday evening, but no decision was announced.Also quiet was President Trump, who ignored questions about Mr. Moore\u2019s increasingly imperiled candidacy, which has been repudiated by much of his party\u2019s leadership.And so a head-spinning afternoon and evening unfolded. A series of new allegations surfaced, Republican leaders met behind closed doors before slipping away from reporters, and a lawyer for Mr. Moore raised an idea probably never before raised in a Senate race \u2014 that handwriting experts analyze a scrawled inscription in a woman\u2019s high school yearbook to see if she had fabricated the signature of a man now running for the Senate.\u201cHe didn\u2019t pinch it; he grabbed it,\u201d Ms. Johnson said, according to the Alabama Media Group report. Ms. Johnson said she had been meeting with Mr. Moore, then a lawyer in private practice, in relation to a child custody matter.Another woman, Gena Richardson, told The Post that Mr. Moore had left her frightened after he gave her a \u201cforceful\u201d kiss when she was about 18 and Mr. Moore was in his 30s.Separately, Kelly Harrison Thorp said that Mr. Moore had sought a date with her when she was 17 and he was in his 30s, and Ms. Gray told The Post about Mr. Moore\u2019s advances.Karen Lancaster, 63, a retired schoolteacher, confirmed Wednesday that Ms. Gray had told her, in the late 1980s, that Mr. Moore repeatedly tried to ask her out during those years at the mall.\u201cI\u2019ve known for over 20 years that he was a predator, that he preyed upon girls in the mall,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge.\u201dMs. Thorp, in a subsequent interview with The New York Times, recalled asking Mr. Moore if he knew how old she was.\u201c\u2018Oh yeah, I go out with girls your age all the time,\u2019\u201d she remembered him replying.Mr. Moore, in an open letter to the conservative talk show host Sean Hannity on Wednesday, flatly said that he \u201cdid not date underage girls.\u201dLess than two hours before Mr. Moore released the letter, a lawyer for him, Phillip L. Jauregui, moved to cast doubt on the credibility of Beverly Young Nelson, who accused Mr. Moore of assaulting her in 1977. He suggested that Ms. Nelson, who came forward Monday, had lied when she said she had no contact with Mr. Moore after the alleged assault.Mr. Jauregui also suggested that a purported message from Mr. Moore to Ms. Nelson in a high school yearbook may have been a forgery, which Mr. Moore\u2019s allies said may have been made using filings related to a divorce case for Ms. Nelson. Mr. Jauregui demanded that Ms. Nelson and her lawyer, Gloria Allred, allow the yearbook to be studied. He did not respond to the substance of Ms. Nelson\u2019s sexual assault allegations, and he did not address the accounts of any other woman who spoke about their encounters with Mr. Moore.Ms. Allred said that she and her client would release the yearbook if a Senate committee agreed to hold a hearing about the allegations against Mr. Moore.The pushback by Mr. Moore\u2019s campaign came as a state party committee met on Wednesday afternoon, in Hoover, Ala., near Birmingham, to discuss whether Mr. Moore should remain the Republican nominee for the Dec. 12 special election. The party did not comment on Wednesday night, but Republican activists said they believed officials had contemplated withdrawing the party\u2019s nomination of Mr. Moore.It was not immediately clear how much the efforts by the Moore campaign and the new accounts would affect the Senate race. Before the new allegations became public, but after women described advances or misconduct from Mr. Moore when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, Republican officials began distancing themselves, and their party\u2019s money, from his campaign.Asked at a meeting of Republican governors if she was still backing Mr. Moore, Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama replied, \u201cThe election will be Dec. 12.\u201d (She had said this month that she would vote for Mr. Moore, but would not endorse his candidacy.)Separately, Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, told The Associated Press in an interview published on Wednesday that \u201cthere\u2019s a special place in hell for people who prey on children.\u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a valid explanation and I have no reason to doubt the victims\u2019 accounts.\u201dUnsurprisingly to just about anyone here in the northeast Alabama community where Mr. Moore began his political career, the Republican nominee has defiantly shrugged off the anger and broadsides of Republicans in Washington.Indeed, to simultaneously be on the offensive and the defensive is almost customary for Mr. Moore, who was, in effect, twice ousted from the Alabama Supreme Court.\u201cObviously, I\u2019ve made a few people mad,\u201d Mr. Moore said during a campaign stop at a revival in South Alabama on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m the only one who can unite Democrats and Republicans because I seem to be opposed by both.\u201dAlthough Mr. Moore\u2019s campaigns are notoriously spare efforts, Mr. Moore\u2019s supporters said there had been signals of an organized response to the allegations. State Senator Trip Pittman, a Republican, said he had received a list of talking points from the campaign that repeated that Mr. Moore \u201cemphatically denies these false allegations.\u201dBut in an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Pittman made little effort to adhere to them. Instead, he wrestled aloud with the implications of the accusations against Mr. Moore. Other Republicans have stuck more closely to the campaign and suggested they needed little guidance from Mr. Moore because their assumption was that the accusations amounted to a political dirty trick. Mr. Moore\u2019s wife has posted widely shared complaints on Facebook, and the campaign has tried to use the controversy to raise money to strike back at the \u201ccharacter assaults and attacks.\u201d\u201cI think they\u2019re just counting on people bouncing past it,\u201d said the Rev. John Killian, a former president of the Alabama Baptist State Convention, who listened to a Sunday night conference call with the campaign\u2019s chairman. \u201cRoy Moore\u2019s base has never been your Republican base, and it\u2019s worked in the past.\u201dYet even among Mr. Moore\u2019s stalwarts, there is a measure of percolating discontent.\u201cI think there is a real desire among people I\u2019m talking to or see for him to come out and make a point-by-point rebuttal to the allegations or explain them and move on,\u201d said Mathew D. Staver, a lawyer who has represented Mr. Moore and is the chairman of the Liberty Counsel.\u201cFrom the strategy I can see, he\u2019s maintaining the course, and I know these allegations have been deeply hurtful and disturbing to him and Kayla and certainly to everyone,\u201d Mr. Staver said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you can bypass that. I think you\u2019re going to have to hit it head-on.\u201dStill, among Mr. Moore\u2019s most faithful supporters, the ones who have repeatedly propelled him into power \u2014 often with pockets of votes from rural areas \u2014 the campaign\u2019s message is still resonating.\u201cAll I really know is that Christians will always be attacked no matter what,\u201d said Pamela Hicks, an apartment manager who attended Mr. Moore\u2019s speech on Tuesday. \u201cIt could be true, it could be false, but he\u2019s led by God, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201dRichard Fausset and Jess Bidgood reported from Gadsden, Ala.; Thomas Gleaton from Jackson, Ala.; Jonathan Martin from Austin, Tex.; and Trip Gabriel from New York.Advertisement"}

The religious right will become, in effect, a conservative religious PAC that will be able to accept large donations from millionaires and large corporations to push its agenda, leaving secular political activists at a distinct disadvantage.MARK KERNES, LOS ANGELESYou rightly question whether any of the proposed tax cuts for corporations will, as Republicans claim, end up benefiting employees instead of shareholders and executives. While Democrats have been defensively voicing the same doubts, they should instead go on offense and call the Republicans\u2019 bluff by proposing a long overdue raise in the minimum wage.After all, Republicans have argued for years that corporations can\u2019t afford to pay higher wages and remain competitive, but since they are proposing to give corporations a huge tax break, that argument no longer holds water. Now is the time for Democrats to force this issue, and if Republicans balk at the idea of increasing the minimum wage, they will surely be recognized as the party that favors showering corporations with tax breaks while denying working people a decent wage.PETER HANAUER, BERKELEY, CALIF.The fortunes of billionaires are often based on unrealized capital gains on stock or real estate. Therefore, taxes have never been paid on these assets. The pending tax bill keeps the \u201cstep-up in basis\u201d at death, which wipes out the need for heirs to pay capital gains taxes on the appreciated value. The phasing out of the estate tax, along with a \u201cstep-up in basis,\u201d is a double gift for the children of the 1 percent.How is this a benefit for the middle class? Shame on Republicans for this giveaway.STUART L. STEIN, SANTA FE, N.M.The writer is a retired tax attorney.There are many problems with the tax bill currently being considered by Congress. However, a particularly onerous provision is often ignored: the proposal to eliminate the medical expense deduction. This deduction is crucial to middle-class families and cannot be used by the very rich since it is only for medical expenses in excess of 10 percent of income.However, it is crucial for families that incur significant medical expenses. The most obvious is nursing care for the elderly, the cost of which can exceed $100,000 a year. The poor can get Medicaid to pay such expenses. However, the middle class cannot. Medicare does not cover long-term care. Families should not have to bankrupt themselves to care for the elderly.Moreover, if people are forced to spend themselves into bankruptcy, they then become eligible for Medicaid, costing the government even more. Thus, removing this deduction, aside from being unfair, would not save as much as expected.The writer is a retired tax attorney.The Republican tax bill, favoring corporate polluters and the oil industry, would have detrimental effects on our environment. Tax incentives for electric vehicles are being targeted, with House Republicans proposing to scrap the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles.This cut will deter Americans from choosing a greener option when buying their next vehicle, causing air pollution to go up. The only profit in this situation is for oil and gas companies. A greener future is within reach, but not if a tax bill targeting electric vehicles passes.It\u2019s time to put the health and needs of Americans and our Earth ahead of corporate polluters.EVA ENDAHL, WASHINGTONThe writer is an environmental defense intern at Environment America.The question that needs to be asked is: At a time when the economy has been on a sustained recovery for eight years, and the unemployment rate is down to 4.1 percent, why do we need a tax cut at all? Basic economic theory would suggest that it would be more appropriate, under these economic conditions, to try to create a budget surplus and pay down the long-term deficit.JAY MALL, SAN FRANCISCOKatherine Mangu-Ward\u2019s trenchant piece on how Congress promotes its agenda through tax policy fails to touch on one action that could result in a significant increase in revenue without any politician\u2019s ox being gored: beefing up the I.R.S.\u2019s enforcement budget. One recent I.R.S. estimate is that for every additional dollar spent on enforcing compliance, four more dollars would be returned to the Treasury.Politicians on both sides of the aisle should be promoting an enhanced enforcement budget as a way of achieving the holy grail of revenue neutrality without offending any special interest group except, perhaps, tax scofflaws.CRAIG SHAW, TALLAHASSEE, FLA.Advertisement"}

Get ready for huanca\u00edna and huacatay, tiradito and tacu-tacu. Brush up on the rocoto chile and its cousins, pinpoint-bright aji amarillo and aji panca, warmer and fruitier. Renew your friendship with causas and chaufas and leche de tigre, the milk of the tiger, without which there can be no ceviche.At Sen Sakana, you can have more than a taste. The restaurant opened over the summer on the block of West 44th Street that is home to the Algonquin, the Royalton and the Iroquois hotels. There is room for almost 200 people in the square bar up front, the main dining room with rows of light wood tables and chairs in neutral upholstery, and a raised mezzanine that manages to make room for both extra tables and an entire sushi bar.To make this vastness look less like a warehouse and more like a Japanese restaurant, the designer made liberal use of slats. Some run up and down and the rest side to side, and behind some of those slats are lights that flood the walls with red or blue.Sprawling and sleek is not the current fashion, but it has also become apparent that small and handmade does not always mean high quality. Like any style, it can be faked. And one advantage of Sen Sakana\u2019s sprawl is that if you are working in Midtown when the quitting-time whistle blows, or are going there for a show, your chances of getting in are better than average.At six pages, the menu is a bit of a sprawl itself. Its many categories can, however, be distilled down to just four: appetizers, main courses, skewers and sushi.In the first group is a cold cucumber of unusual interest. Covered in crunchy quinoa, toasted sesame seeds and flakes of kelp intensified with soy, it sits on a yellow streak of sauce made from aji amarillo. The menu calls the cucumber yamitsuki, the Japanese word for addictive. I wouldn\u2019t go that far, but it does push a lot of good buttons at once.Gyoza, a half-dozen or so bound together by a crisp, shattering crepe-like lid, are filled with shrimp, crab and an exhilaratingly big jolt of fresh ginger. Sea bream tiradito gets a shower of shio kombu and two sauces; the tart yellow one is mango with aji amarillo and white soy; and the spicy green one is cilantro. Another tiradito sets raw bigeye tuna, daikon sprouts and pickled daikon in a lake of cilantro-jalape\u00f1o sauce.I\u2019d order any of these again, which I can\u2019t say about all the appetizers. Root vegetable chips were more oily than crisp. Sen Sakana also has a take on Japanese onigiri in which causa, the Peruvian whipped-potato constructions, are pinched inside sheets of nori. The idea is more interesting than the flavors; the potatoes needed seasoning, and the crab and chopped salmon fillings, advertised as spicy, weren\u2019t very.With the exception of undercrisped chicken skin, the skewers of meats and vegetables grilled over charcoal on a robata are worth investigating, especially the Japanese sweet potato with a melting slab of aji amarillo-spiked butter, and the pork belly stuffed with queso cremoso, which has the texture of mozzarella that is trying to turn itself into cream cheese.The short roster of main courses on the menu nearly gets lost. This wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing in the case of the skirt steak over tacu-tacu, a go-to rice-and-beans dish in Peru that becomes a flavorless paste here. But there are better choices, like a pleasantly unorthodox oyakodon, with an egg and chicken thigh over rice cooked with cilantro and pumpkin. And the chicken nanban removes any doubt that quinoa can make an effectively crunchy crust for fried chicken.Peru and Japan each have one representative in the main kitchen, where two chefs, Mina Newman and Taku Nagai, share power. Ms. Newman is a New Yorker who spent summers as a child in Chiclayo, the city in northwestern Peru where her mother was born. Mr. Nagai, an Osaka native, is a veteran of Japanese restaurants in New York and Asia. The two generally keep up with the number of seats and the size of the menu, although waits between courses sometimes drag.The dining room staff doesn\u2019t seem as well organized. My servers were cheerful and communicated well with customers, but not necessarily with each other. Three people in a row would stop by to ask the same question, and just clearing the table seemed to take a cast of hundreds.Sen Sakana\u2019s best sushi is somewhere in between: what Mr. Lee calls Nikkei sashimi and nigiri. Augmented with Peruvian or Japanese flavors, these pieces are only slightly out of bounds, and can be delicious. There\u2019s pleasurable tension in topping raw scallop with a tiny fleck of yuzu-ponzu jelly and commas of shaved lemon peel, or brushing sea bream with a tart, spicy sauce of yuzu and aji amarillo, then dotting it with a tiny bit of salted plum paste. Add six more things and they would all start to collide somewhere over the Pacific.One dessert is a small waffle made from batter that contains squash and sweet potato, a homage to Peruvian picarones, with a dark molasses syrup. Another is a shallow-pan chocolate tres leches cake, which tasted something like a dense brownie over which somebody poured a glass of cocktail de algarrobina, Peru\u2019s answer to eggnog. It had never occurred to me to soak a brownie in eggnog. \u201cDoes this make sense?\u201d I asked, between bites, until it was gone.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: A Renowned Chef\u2019s Advice for Beginners", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this refrigerated Tuesday.With Thanksgiving on the horizon, we have food on the brain.Before dinner service kicked off at Eleven Madison Park on a recent weeknight, we sat down with Mr. Humm and asked for advice from a life spent in the kitchen. (His responses have been edited down.)How does someone get started in your field?I think culinary school can be the right path, but only if someone comes from a background where their parents have money or they will not have student loans. Some of our best chefs never went to culinary schools.What is the most important quality in a chef?Passion. It\u2019s not about talent. It\u2019s about education, hard work and passion. In German the word for passion is \u201cleidenschaft\u201d and it sort of means suffering, or to enjoy suffering, or be willing to suffer for it. That\u2019s what passion is. It\u2019s not like a hobby. The German word says it much better: Be willing to suffer or enjoy suffering for it.What is your best advice to newcomers?Be patient. At first, cooking is about repetition. We do things over and over and over again, and it takes a person who enjoys that.Be focused. New York is an amazing place, but it\u2019s also incredibly distracting. There are so many cuisines alone. You could say, hey, I want to learn how to make pizza, or Japanese food is really cool. Or I want to learn how to make French food, or how to bake, or how to make pasta. All these things can be super distracting, and my advice is, just focus on what you want to be the best at.Don\u2019t jump around. Think about what you want and then pick the restaurant that fits that, and stay there for two, three or four years. When I look at chefs who stayed somewhere for a long time, I see them much more evolved.How do you become a top chef?Cooking is a craft. To learn a craft, it\u2019s not about creating at first. There is a right way to do a consomm\u00e9, a stock, searing meat, or making an omelet.

{"Headline": "She Warned of \u2018Peer-to-Peer Misinformation.\u2019 Congress Listened.", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Before the sun came up on Oct. 31, Renee DiResta sat in bed in her pajamas and logged into a virtual war room.Ms. DiResta knew the lines of questioning inside and out. Along with a handful of people with a similarly obsessive interest in mapping data across social media, she had helped prepare congressional staff members ahead of the hearings. That morning, they gathered in a dedicated channel on the Slack messaging app to watch and listen for answers to questions they had been asking for years.\u201cWe were monitoring closely to see when the companies gave misleading or partial answers so that we could follow up,\u201d said Ms. DiResta, 36, who became immersed in disinformation campaigns in her spare time outside of her job as a founder and head of marketing at Haven, a shipping technology company.How a small group of self-made experts came to advise Congress on disinformation campaigns is a testament to just how long tech companies have failed to find a solution to the problem. For years, the informal group \u2014 about a dozen or so people \u2014 have meticulously logged data and published reports on how easy it was to manipulate social media platforms.In 2016, they monitored thousands of Twitter accounts that suddenly started using bots, or automated accounts, to spread salacious stories about the Clinton family. They watched as multiple Facebook pages, appearing out of nowhere, organized to simultaneously create anti-immigrant events. Nearly all of those watching were hobbyists, logging countless hours outside their day jobs.Senate and House staff members, who knew of Ms. DiResta\u2019s expertise through her public reports and her previous work advising the Obama administration on disinformation campaigns, had contacted her and others to help them prepare for the hearings.Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement that researchers like Ms. DiResta had shown real insight into the platforms, \u201cin many cases, despite efforts by some of the platforms to undermine their research.\u201d Mr. Warner is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.One crucial line of the questioning \u2014 on how much influence Russian-bought advertisements and content had on users \u2014 was the result of work by Ms. DiResta and others with a Facebook-owned tool. \u201cFacebook has the tools to monitor how far this content is spreading,\u201d Ms. DiResta said. \u201cThe numbers they were originally providing were trying to minimize it.\u201dMs. DiResta contended that that is still just the tip of the iceberg. Minimizing the scope of the problem was \u201ca na\u00efve form of damage control,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about punishing Facebook or Twitter. This is us saying, this is important and we can do better.\u201dIn response, Facebook said it had begun organizing academic discussions on disinformation.\u201cWe regularly engage with dozens of sociologists, political scientists, data scientists and communications scholars, and we both read and incorporate their findings into our work,\u201d said Jay Nancarrow, a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe value the work of researchers, and we are going to continue to work with them closely.\u201dA graduate of Stony Brook University in New York, Ms. DiResta wrote her college thesis on propaganda in the 2004 Russian elections. She then spent seven years on Wall Street as a trader, watching the slow introduction of automation into the market. She recalled the initial fear of overreliance on algorithms, as there were \u201cbad actors who could come in and manipulate the system into making bad trades.\u201d\u201cI look at that now and I see a lot of parallels to today, especially for the need for nuance in technological transformations,\u201d Ms. DiResta said. \u201cJust like technology is never leaving Wall Street, social media companies are not leaving our society.\u201dMs. DiResta moved to San Francisco in 2011 for a job with the O\u2019Reilly Alpha Tech Venture Capital firm. But it wasn\u2019t until the birth of her first child a few years later, that Ms. DiResta started to examine the dark side of social media.\u201cWhen my son was born, I began looking into vaccines. I found myself wondering about the clustering effects where the anti-vaccine movement was concentrated,\u201d Ms. DiResta recalled. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018What on earth is going on here? Why is this movement gaining so much momentum here?\u2019\u201dShe started tracking posts made by anti-vaccine accounts on Facebook and mapping the data. What she discovered, she said, was that Facebook\u2019s platform was tailor-made for a small group of vocal people to amplify their voices, especially if their views veered toward the conspiratorial.\u201cIt was this great case study in peer-to-peer misinformation,\u201d Ms. DiResta said. Through one account she created to monitor anti-vaccine groups on Facebook, she quickly realized she was being pushed toward other anti-vaccine accounts, creating an echo chamber in which it appeared that viewpoints like \u201cvaccines cause autism\u201d were the majority.Soon, her Facebook account began promoting content to her on a range of other conspiratorial ideas, ranging from people who claim the earth is flat to those who believe that \u201cchem trails,\u201d or trails left in the sky by planes, were spraying chemical agents on an unsuspecting public.\u201cSo by Facebook suggesting all these accounts, they were essentially creating this vortex in which conspiratorial ideas can just breed and multiply,\u201d Ms. DiResta said.She recalled a meeting with tech companies at the White House in February 2016 where executives, policy leaders and administration officials were told that American-made social media platforms were key to the dissemination of propaganda by ISIS.\u201cWe kept saying this was not a one-off. This was a toolbox anyone can use,\u201d Ms. DiResta said. \u201cWe told the tech companies that they had created a mass way to reach Americans.\u201dA year and a half later, they hope everyone is finally listening. \u201cI think we are at this real moment, where as a society we are asking how much responsibility these companies have toward ensuring that their platforms aren\u2019t being gamed, and that we, as their users, aren\u2019t being pushed toward disinformation,\u201d Ms. DiResta said.Follow Sheera Frenkel on Twitter: @sheerafAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lurking in Toilets, Swimming the Streets: Snakes of Bangkok Move In", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBangkok JournalBANGKOK \u2014 Panarat Chaiyaboon was using the toilet in her downstairs bathroom in July when she felt a sharp bite on her thigh. She jumped up to see a scene straight out of a nightmare: an 8-foot python emerging from her toilet.She rushed to the hospital, bleeding heavily, and still bears the marks from eight tooth punctures that were around half an inch deep.That snake was captured. But a week later, Ms. Panarat\u2019s 15-year-old daughter found a second python in the same toilet. The daughter was so shaken, she went to stay with relatives.It could be argued that snakes have always owned this corner of Thailand, and that the people of Bangkok are merely borrowing it from them. The main airport, Suvarnabhumi, was built in a place called Cobra Swamp, and the city itself took shape on the Chao Phraya River delta \u2014 a marshy reptile paradise.But this year, the Bangkok Fire and Rescue Department, which removes snakes from homes, has been busier than ever.As of Monday, the department had received 31,801 calls this year for help in removing snakes. That is more calls than for all of last year (29,919), and more than three times the number in 2012 (10,492).On one recent day, the fire department received 173 snake invasion calls, versus five fire alarms. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could survive if there were more fires than snakes,\u201d said Prayul Krongyos, the department\u2019s deputy director.The department\u2019s figures don\u2019t even include the many thousands of snakes that are killed or removed by residents on their own or taken from homes by volunteer handlers.Most of the snakes rescued by firefighters are taken to a wildlife center and eventually released in the wild.Mr. Prayul and the department are nowhere near panic. One reason for the rising numbers is growing public awareness that firefighters can help remove snakes and other animals.It has also been a wet year, even by Bangkok standards. Heavy rains bring a surge in the number of snakes seeking refuge indoors. Flooding can turn city streets into snake highways as the creatures are forced from their hiding places and swim for higher ground.And as the sprawling city of more than 8.2 million people continues to expand into formerly wild lands, the number of snake encounters is rising. Most of the snake removal calls come from neighborhoods on the perimeter of the city where new housing is destroying what\u2019s left of the creatures\u2019 domain, Mr. Prayul explained.\u201cWhen people build houses in their habitat, of course they will seek a dry spot in people\u2019s houses because they can\u2019t go anywhere else,\u201d he said.All reasonable explanations. But casual discussion tends to end when it\u2019s your toilet the snake is in.\u201cThere are snakes everywhere!\u201d said Kanok Praditkranok, Ms. Panarat\u2019s husband. \u201cThey live beneath people\u2019s houses, they live in holes, they live in the wilderness and in the ground. But they shouldn\u2019t be able to enter people\u2019s houses.\u201dThe reality, though, is that humans cause snakes much more harm than the other way around.Thailand has more than 200 snake species, including about three dozen that are venomous. But most do not pose a threat to people.\u201cStories of snakes invading homes always sound scary, but as long as you don\u2019t provoke them, they won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d Mr. Prayul said. \u201cThere are only a few cases where snakes come into people\u2019s houses and hurt them.\u201dIn Bangkok, where garbage bags often pile up on sidewalks awaiting collection, snakes perform a public service by catching rats and other vermin.\u201cSnakes are among the most misunderstood animals in the world,\u201d said Nonn Panitvong, a leading expert in biodiversity. \u201cPeople are afraid of snakes and don\u2019t take time to identify them. In Thailand, they just kill the snakes.\u201dTo keep the animals from being needlessly slaughtered, Mr. Nonn helped set up the \u201cSnake at Home\u201d message group on the popular Line phone app. People who encounter a snake can send a photo to the group\u2019s volunteer experts and get an immediate reply on whether it is venomous.\u201cWe can give them instant answers so maybe the snake will live,\u201d said Mr. Nonn, who in August was named Thailand\u2019s first ASEAN Biodiversity Hero, a new award created by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to honor conservation advocates.Started this year, Snake at Home has 29,000 followers and receives nearly 30 identification requests a day.The identification service also has helped save a number of humans.Doctors make more than half the identification requests in the hope of learning whether a snake that bit a patient was venomous and, if so, which species, so they can use the correct antivenin.\u201cIn Thailand, homes continue to expand into the natural environment, so there will be always more snakes in the homes,\u201d Mr. Nonn said.The family fixed the problem and has not seen a python since.Despite the widespread fear of snakes in Thailand, an encounter with one is considered by many to be a sign of good luck.One relative wrote on her page, \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying that if you encounter a snake, you will meet your soul mate.\u201dMs. Panarat jokingly replied, \u201cI\u2019d rather be a widow.\u201dA caption with a previous version of this article misidentified the type of snake shown with the firefighter Surapong Suebchai.

{"Headline": "In \u2018Watershed Moment,\u2019 YouTube Blocks Extremist Cleric\u2019s Message", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For eight years, the jihadist propaganda of Anwar al-Awlaki has helped shape a generation of American terrorists, including the Fort Hood gunman, the Boston Marathon bombers and the perpetrators of massacres in San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando, Fla.And YouTube, the world\u2019s most popular video site, has allowed hundreds of hours of Mr. Awlaki\u2019s talks to be within easy reach of anyone with a phone or computer.A search for \u201cAnwar al-Awlaki\u201d on YouTube this fall found more than 70,000 videos, including his life\u2019s work, from his early years as a mainstream American imam to his later years with Al Qaeda in Yemen.He said the fact that much of Mr. Awlaki\u2019s presence was lectures on Islamic history did not justify keeping it on YouTube. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to Islam to say the teaching of the religion can\u2019t stand the loss of a preacher who was also the leading propagandist of jihad in English,\u201d he said.The policy shift at YouTube comes in the face of a growing chorus of criticism for internet companies, including Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube. They had long argued that they were merely neutral platforms with no responsibility for what users posted.But they were quick to remove copyrighted material, child pornography and beheading videos, for example, which posed an obvious threat to their business. They have slowly stepped up the removal of extremist content, spurred on after 2014 by the Islamic State\u2019s use of Twitter to recruit fighters.Most recently, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube all admitted that the Russian government had used their platforms last year to pose as American voters and spread divisive propaganda. Under fire from Congress, all the companies pledged to police their sites more carefully in the future.Born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents, Mr. Awlaki spent half his life in the United States and spoke excellent English. As a popular young imam in Denver, San Diego and a Washington, D.C., suburb, he recorded lecture series that were eventually best sellers among Western Muslims \u2014 notably his 53-CD boxed set on the life of the Prophet Muhammad.Mr. Awlaki and three other members of Al Qaeda were killed in a drone strike in Yemen in September 2011. But his death on Mr. Obama\u2019s orders made him a martyr in the eyes of many admirers, who posted more and more of his work on YouTube.As pressure mounted, however, the company recently decided to treat Mr. Awlaki the way it treats terrorist organizations, with a near-total ban, according to company officials. The officials agreed to discuss the policy change but declined to be named, citing security concerns.YouTube said the initial decision to purge any particular video was made by human reviewers. But once the decision has been made, a \u201chash function,\u201d a kind of digital fingerprint, is created to automatically rid the site of additional copies of the same video.The officials noted that YouTube, according to its published rules, \u201cstrictly prohibits content intended to recruit for terrorist organizations, incite violence, celebrate terrorist attacks or otherwise promote acts of terrorism.\u201d But they decided that in the special case of Mr. Awlaki, all of his recordings should be removed.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a major drop-off of his work on YouTube,\u201d said Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, the research director at George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism and author of a forthcoming book on Mr. Awlaki. \u201cThey deserve credit for that.\u201dSome civil libertarians cautioned about the dangers of censorship, even by a company rather than a government.\u201cThe motivations that lead any individual to commit an act of violence are very complex,\u201d said Faiza Patel of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school. \u201cTo pin it on one guy\u2019s videos seems very simplistic.\u201dMr. Meleagrou-Hitchens noted that Mr. Awlaki\u2019s work remains easy to find elsewhere on the web for those seeking it. A weekend search for Mr. Awlaki\u2019s \u201cCall to Jihad,\u201d for instance, instantly brought up the video on a French site, Dailymotion; on the Internet Archive; and on a Pakistani\u2019s Facebook page.Nonetheless, Mr. Meleagrou-Hitchens said, the popularity of YouTube and its automated recommendations have made it an especially pernicious platform for the cleric.\u201cThe fact is that if you really want Awlaki videos, you\u2019ll find them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if he\u2019s less available on YouTube, fewer people are coming across him who aren\u2019t actually seeking him out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wavering Senators Buy Trump\u2019s Assurances on Taxes. Really.", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySusan Collins and some other senators who had hinted they might oppose the Republican tax bill giveaway to the super rich are changing their tune. Apparently, President Trump assured them over lunch that he\u2019s going to fix the bill.Are they actually that clueless? Or do they merely think the rest of us are?One of the few certainties in these uncertain times is that no one can rely on anything Trump says. But these senators believe him now? The only other option is that they know Trump\u2019s pledges to \u201cfix\u201d the tax bill are insincere and they are conning their constituents and the rest of America.Neither possibility is appetizing, but that\u2019s where we are after Trump met with Republican senators to talk about the tax bill.Participants told reporters that Trump was paying attention and seemed to understand the details. Think about that. It\u2019s news when this president seems to grasp an even slightly complicated idea.After the meeting, Trump announced that the bill will \u201chave lots of adjustments before it ends, but the end result will be a very, very massive \u2014 the largest in the history of our country \u2014 tax cut.\u201dAnother false assurance. It was never going be the biggest tax cut in history, and the only \u201cvery, very massive\u201d reductions are going to corporations and extremely wealthy individuals, like Trump.(Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, thinks that is enough to get a new car or redo your kitchen.)The tax bill will blow a gigantic hole in the deficit, as much as $1.5 trillion, and the so-called deficit hawks, like Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, know that.But Trump apparently allayed Johnson\u2019s concerns with a deft and powerful argument. \u201cCome on, Ron,\u201d he is reported to have said during a lunch on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.Johnson came out of the meeting saying that \u201cthe good news is, everybody agrees it\u2019s a problem, it has to be fixed.\u201dHe added: \u201cI just keep getting assurances it\u2019s going to be fixed. I just want to see how.\u201dSo Johnson may be keeping open the possibility of opposing the bill on the Senate floor after voting for it in the Budget Committee. I doubt it, just as I doubt that the promised \u201cfixes\u201d will materialize.And even if they do, they may take the form of \u201ctriggers\u201d that will roll back tax cuts if the bill doesn\u2019t magically reduce the budget deficit. (Triggers, by the way, are strongly opposed by right-wing tax groups that dictate policy to Republicans.)\u201cI think we\u2019ve come to a pretty acceptable place, from my standpoint,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who had been denouncing the tax bill.Collins is not committing herself to the bill but is more optimistic after the lunch. \u201cI believe that a lot of my concerns, it appears, are going to be addressed and that I\u2019m going to be getting the opportunity to offer amendments on the Senate floor,\u201d she said.Right.Even if she miraculously gets those amendments through the Senate, the bill will then go to a conference with the House, whose tax measure is worse and is under the grip of the most right-wing Republican caucus the nation has ever endured.As for Trump\u2019s assurances, he has not been telling the truth about the tax bill from the start.Trump also once assured us that the United States under his leadership would lead the world, but the nation\u2019s allies are running from him, and its adversaries are delighted by how easy he is to manipulate with red carpets, fancy parties and military parades.During the campaign, he said the comments he made on the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video about assaulting women and getting away with were just \u201clocker room talk.\u201d Now he\u2019s claiming the tape was fabricated.After Trump visited the Times editorial board last year seeking our endorsement, I told my older brother, Dan, how moderate Trump had sounded.Dan said he was amazed at how gullible I was after four decades in journalism. \u201cThat\u2019s just the Trump that he wants the Times editorial board to believe exists,\u201d he said.I didn\u2019t have to hear that lesson twice. Apparently some of our senators still haven\u2019t got it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carl F. Bucherer Covers the Field", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe have no thought of joining a big group,\u201d Sascha Moeri, the brand\u2019s chief executive, said during an interview in the boardroom of its sprawling factory.Mr. Moeri, 44, spends one day a week here, traveling from the company headquarters in Lucerne to confer with engineers on the movements that the brand creates in-house and the ones it develops with partners (used in 35 percent of its timepieces) and development of its five lines, which the company calls \u201cfamilies.\u201d Manero, Patravi and Adamavi are primarily bought by men, Mr. Moeri said, while Pathos and Alacria are dedicated to women.The brand, commonly called C.F.B., sells its mechanical watches for $2,500 to $30,000, although its top-end models go for as much as $400,000. Among its quartz timepieces, the least expensive is an Adamavi steel model that sells for $2,000. \u201cWe have price diversity in each family,\u201d Mr. Moeri said. \u201cEntry level, midlevel and the \u2018cherry on the cake\u2019 for big complications or jewels.\u201dAs a privately owned business, C.F.B. does not release revenue information. But the growth of watch sales to Chinese buyers has had a big effect: This year, the company\u2019s 16th selling outside Switzerland, the factory is expected to produce 25,000 watches. That is four times as many as it did in 2010, when Mr. Moeri, a Swiss-German from nearby Biel, joined the company.He came from the Swiss watchmaker Milus, where he had spent eight years, and began his career at age 22 in the accounting department at the Swatch Group.Mr. Moeri said the sales downturn that roiled the watch industry over the last two years did not have a strong effect on the brand as 40 percent of its sales are in Asia, where activity did not slow as dramatically. \u201cFor us, it was different,\u201d he added. \u201cAsia is super important. And a lot of our business today is done by Asians traveling abroad.\u201d(As for the rest of its sales, 30 percent is from Europe, 20 percent from North America and 10 percent from the Middle East and other areas.)Apart from the brand\u2019s traditional European base, its Greater China sales region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, is considered the company\u2019s crucial market, supplemented by outlets in Japan. Mr. Moeri also believes that there are potential sales spots throughout the region, particularly in Indonesia and Vietnam.As an example of its Asian outreach, last year the Chinese film star Li Bingbing signed on as C.F.B.\u2019s first global brand ambassador. Her image now appears on Chinese billboards and in global social media, including Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, to promote the jeweled models of Pathos and Alacria.)Mr. Moeri said Asian men favored the Manero line, a group of classic dress watches, while he wears the chunky Patravi TravelTec, calling the chronograph a sporty \u201cAmerican hotcake.\u201dStill, the brand\u2019s Asian expansion \u2014 it sells in 150 stores throughout the region \u2014 has had its bumps. DFS, the duty-free department store that was its sole outlet in Singapore, stopped carrying the brand in September, a sales associate saying there were insufficient sales to its primary shoppers, tourists from mainland China.The company\u2019s origins date from 1888, when the watchmaker Carl Friedrich Bucherer opened a jewelry and watch shop in Lucerne.Today his grandson, J\u00f6rg G. Bucherer, 81, owns the Bucherer Group, one of Europe\u2019s largest watch and jewelry retail chains. And C.F.B., established in 2001, is one of its subsidiaries.As chairman of the watchmaker\u2019s board of directors, Mr. Bucherer is involved in all its major decisions, such as buying and retrofitting the factory here in Lengnau, where Gucci once produced watches. This isolated factory town at the foot of the Jura Mountains also is home to the Rado watch factory, and near those of Rolex, Breitling and ETA, the movement manufacturer that is part of Swatch.\u201cMr. Bucherer is a fast decider \u2014 split seconds,\u201d Mr. Moeri said (just after returning from taking the chairman\u2019s call). \u201cIf he agrees with the strategy, you can move forward. His word is his bond.\u201dThe renovated factory, which officially opened in June 2016, is divided into three departments: production and assembly, movements, and customer service. \u201cWe can go to 30,000 pieces, but after that we will need more production room,\u201d Mr. Moeri said, adding that increasing Asian interest, along with traditional European demand, may require the company to have additional space within the next two years.On the open-plan assembly floor, technicians in white coats sit at rows of well-lighted desks, wearing loupes to fix hands, dials and movements. Most are women, who generally score higher on the firm\u2019s dexterity tests than men; when workers are hired, they spend three to six months in training before they are allowed to work independently.Movement production is highly automated, and the company is increasing automation whenever possible. Engineers refine computer production plans, written in French, that were developed for each of a movement\u2019s 500 parts \u2014 while nearby sets of whirring machines cut tiny components, set the movements\u2019 jewels, polish elements and imprint serial numbers as well as check waterproofing, accuracy and magnetic-resistance.The company\u2019s watchmakers, who have years of training and experience, are concentrated in customer service, revitalizing watches sent in for repair or refurbishing.For Mr. Moeri, however, a highlight of the factory tour was a chance to talk about the role that the company\u2019s watches played in \u201cAtomic Blonde,\u201d the spy thriller this summer starring Charlize Theron.There were three models in the movie, a presence arranged by the movie\u2019s director, David Leitch, who is a C.F.B. brand ambassador, but it was the Manero CentralChrono that had the most screen time. (Spoiler: A list of double agents was embedded inside.)Flipping over a Manero Flyback, another model in the film, Mr. Moeri touched the case\u2019s sapphire glass back. An outer ring turns around the 25-jewel movement, a CFB 1970 caliber, which can measure multiple time intervals in rapid succession.\u201cOur product is the hero,\u201d Mr. Moeri said.Advertisement"}

Together, they are taking the British monarchy \u2014 that most conservative of institutions \u2014 into a more modern era.Prince Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and fifth in line to the throne, is engaged to Meghan Markle, his American girlfriend, the royal family said on Monday.It is a marked difference, for example, from the queen, who has maintained a more traditionally aloof style.The pair have dated for more than a year, and made their first official outing together in September in Toronto at the Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style competition for wounded or sick members of the military and veterans.Like his brother, Prince Harry grew up in the public eye, first as a son of the heir to the throne, and then as an adolescent struggling over the loss of his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a car accident when he was 12. His grief played out in what he described as \u201ctotal chaos\u201d in his 20s, a period that was gleefully pounced on by the tabloids.The relationship of Prince Harry and Ms. Markle also has been the subject of intense scrutiny.As a rebellious youth, he partied heavily, including an episode in 2005, when he wore a Nazi costume with a swastika armband, just weeks before his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, was scheduled to lead Holocaust memorial ceremonies.In 2009, a video emerged of him using racial slurs during his first tour of duty in Afghanistan. In the footage, he is seen referring to a Pakistani member of his platoon as a \u201cour little Paki friend\u201d and calls another soldier a \u201craghead.\u201d He later apologized.In another unusual break from palace protocol, he divulged to a newspaper that he had suffered for years from grief after the death of his mother, before finally getting help about three years ago at the urging of Prince William.In 2016, he took an H.I.V. test and broadcast it live on the royals\u2019 Facebook page in 2016 to promote the importance being tested for the virus that causes AIDS.Get the Morning Briefing in your inbox. What you need to know to start your day, each weekday morning.Prince Harry\u2019s public statement last year in defense of Ms. Markle effectively confirmed their relationship, and it also took aim at the British newspapers that have long hungered for news of the royals and their foibles.In their first interview since the announcement, Ms. Markle revealed that she had very little understanding of the British royal family and its significance.\u201cI didn\u2019t know much about him,\u201d she told the BBC, referring to her fianc\u00e9, adding that the pair had been set up on a blind date by a friend.\u201cThe only thing I asked her was, \u2018Was he nice?\u2019 \u201dPrince Harry said he tried to prepare her for the media scrutiny. \u201cI tried to warn you as much as possible,\u201d he said. Still, \u201cwe were totally surprised by the reaction. We were totally unprepared.\u201dWhen asked about the way she has been portrayed by some British media, Ms. Markle replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that that is the climate in this world. At the end of the day I\u2019m proud of who I am and where I come from. We just focus on who we are as a couple.\u201dTheir relationship is not the first in which a British royal has fallen in love with an American partner who had been married before.Harry\u2019s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, divorced in 1996.Kate\u2019s wedding to Prince William was also unusual in the context of the royal family because she was a commoner: Her parents had founded a mail-order party supply company.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Henry VIII\u2019s relationship to Prince Harry. Although Henry VIII is a distant relative of Prince Harry, he is not an ancestor.Anna Schaverien, Susanne Fowler and Prashant S. Rao contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Investigation Has Tech Giants Shying From \u2018Social\u2019 Label", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After years of trying unsuccessfully to build a social network to rival Facebook, Google finally got something out of all of its failures: cover.Tech companies have taken a pounding in the court of public opinion in recent months. In the eyes of their critics, they have become too big, too powerful and too unmindful of their influence. And this week\u2019s congressional hearings cast added and unflattering light on the industry\u2019s growing embarrassment over the Russian election meddling.\u201cWithout sufficient oversight, these companies never imagined hostile intelligence services would misuse their platforms in this way,\u201d said Renee DiResta, an independent security researcher at Data for Democracy. \u201cThe people running it appear to not fully appreciate what they\u2019ve designed.\u201dNot surprisingly, perhaps, a few of the industry\u2019s biggest companies have been happy to say, in essence, don\u2019t blame us.Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive and an outspoken critic of the data-collection practices of his company\u2019s technological rivals, said Wednesday that he was concerned that social networks could be weaponized against the people who use them.With the emergence of Facebook, Twitter and their ilk over the last decade, \u201csocial\u201d became a key Silicon Valley buzzword as companies crammed social network-like features into new products. Even Apple, despite the tens of billions of dollars it has earned making computing devices, has tried its hand at a social network focused on music.But as social media has become increasingly connected to unpleasant bickering, race-baiting and Russian propaganda, the must-have \u201csocial\u201d label has become an albatross, said Joseph Bayer, an assistant professor at Ohio State University who focuses on social networks.\u201cThe mere fact that a tech company is trying to minimize its overall influence is a telling signal of the moment we\u2019re in,\u201d said Mr. Bayer.Google, which operates under the parent company Alphabet, can offer a distinction between its business and how social networks operate \u2014 largely because its attempts to build a social network have not been very successful.The company spent millions of dollars creating Google+, a social site built specifically to take on Facebook. The company tied Google+ into nearly every one of its properties, describing it as the \u201csocial spine\u201d of Google in public statements at the time.There also were short-lived efforts like Google Buzz and Google Wave, or geographically specific sites like Orkut \u2014 popular in Brazil but ignored elsewhere.Google+ continues to exist but it is considered a disappointment. Google said it had found no political posts from state-linked actors on Google+.Google said accounts believed to have ties to the Kremlin had uploaded more than 1,100 videos to YouTube on racial, religious and political topics. Those videos were viewed 309,000 times. Many of those videos had only a small number of views, though they were \u201cfrequently posted to other social media platforms,\u201d Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s senior counsel in law enforcement and information security, told a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday.Facebook, to offer a comparison, estimated that 150 million users of Facebook and its subsidiary, Instagram, had been exposed to 80,000 posts that came from the Russian influence campaign.Twitter said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts that were linked to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, a company tied to the Kremlin, between September 2016 and November 2016. Those accounts posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period. Twitter identified an additional 36,000 automated accounts that had posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that same period. The tweets received about 288 million views.\u201cNow you\u2019re seeing all the attention from Congress go to Facebook and Twitter, because they\u2019re the linchpin\u201d of the Russian information operations, said Ms. DiResta, the security researcher.In his testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, sought to draw a bright line separating his company\u2019s services from social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which has been an occasional subject of Google acquisition rumors.He also played down what Google knows about its users, a surprising conceit for a company that makes more money than anybody from selling advertising based on the online interests of users.\u201cWe\u2019re somewhat differently positioned because we\u2019re not primarily a social network,\u201d Mr. Walker said in response to a question regarding whether Google should notify users who are exposed to propaganda or divisive content from a foreign government. \u201cMany users are not logged in when they access content, so it\u2019s difficult to know who sees what.\u201dStill, social media remains a compelling proposition for internet companies, even Google, because it keeps people coming back and creates a place for them to spend their time, said Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology data firm Jackdaw Research.\u201cIf you gave Google the choice of having a social network, even with everything that\u2019s happened,\u201d said Mr. Dawson. \u201cI think it would still like to have one.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Key Takeaways From Steve Bannon\u2019s Interview With The Times", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News and the former White House chief strategist, spoke with Jeremy W. Peters, a reporter for The New York Times, in a wide-ranging interview on Wednesday.The following are highlights from the transcript of that interview, with analysis from Mr. Peters.PETERS: I think it\u2019s more than a couple, but it\u2019ll do. So taking it back to the permanent political class, I think the chief offender in your mind is Mitch McConnell. So tell us what you have against Mitch McConnell.BANNON: I think \u2014 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s the chief offender, but he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s the \u2014 he. It\u2019s both individuals and institutions. Washington\u2019s an institutional city. Remember, we\u2019ve had quite a \u2014 a \u2014 quite a run. This \u2014 this \u2014 this movement not only stopped the Dreamers bill in the summer of 2013, a year later, for the first time in the history of the Republic, we removed in a primary the majority leader in \u2014 in Cantor. Right? And then later the following year, Donald Trump came down the escalator riding the same \u2014 the same \u2014 he was No. 7 at the top of the escalator. He\u2019s No. 7. By the \u2014 when he came down the escalator after the speech, I think that evening or the next morning \u2014 he was No. 1 in the polls. O.K.?Mr. Bannon is often characterized as far-right. But he has always seen himself as a player in a broader political movement that, at its core, is neither right nor left, but populist.In his ideal world, he would stitch together a coalition that draws in disaffected working-class voters from both parties who share a belief that they are powerless in the current economic and political system and disrespected by its leaders. Accomplishing this with a leader as polarizing as President Trump, of course, is more theoretical at this point than realistic.PETERS: So, Phase 1 is Trump\u2019s election. Is Phase 2 the conservative populist takeover of Congress?But a year, you know, a year later, the governor of Virginia lost. It\u2019s a blue state. Everything like that. But I keep telling people: Every day is going to be a struggle. You\u2019re going to win some and you\u2019re going to lose some, but it\u2019s a process. It\u2019s a process. So the process now goes why is Mitch McConnell? Because the Senate and Mitch McConnell have been the \u2014 the most outrageous in their lack of support of President Trump\u2019s agenda.One of the unresolved questions clouding Mr. Bannon\u2019s vision to build an enduring populist movement is whether it can transcend Mr. Trump. Mr. Bannon acknowledges that Mr. Trump is a once-in-a-lifetime charismatic leader. But he can\u2019t be the movement\u2019s leader forever. And once Mr. Trump is out of office, it is not clear that the movement he empowered lives on.Mr. Bannon took a significant gamble by betting on Mr. Moore \u2014 though Mr. Moore was not his first choice in the primary race to defeat Senator Luther Strange, the Alabama Republican who became a target of Mr. Bannon and other anti-establishment conservatives. Mr. Moore could end up being what every establishment Republican warned of: a renegade conservative who won the primary only to lose the general election and deliver a seat to the Democrats.PETERS: So was that like a Fort Sumter in your civil war? You\u2019ve got Jeff Flake on the run?PETERS: Do you think Mitch McConnell will be majority leader at this time next year?BANNON: I absolutely do not think he will be majority leader.PETERS: Is that your personal mission to make that not happen?BANNON: It\u2019s not my personal mission, but it is an objective that I \u2014 I have an objective that Mitch McConnell will not be majority leader, and I believe will be done before this time next year.Conservatives like Mr. Bannon want to make the 2018 Senate elections, in large part, a referendum on Mr. McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader. In his meetings with potential Senate candidates, Mr. Bannon has been asking them to make a pledge not to support Mr. McConnell for another term as leader.People are going to have to get over their differences on the right. And I\u2019ve said this \u2014 Breitbart was very active in this \u2014 in this campaign at the end doing lots of stories, doing lots of profiles. Breitbart radio. And the reason is \u2014 is that, hey, Gillespie\u2019s not a guy that\u2019s particularly, you know, excites me.Will the Republican Party be the Bush/Rubio party or the Trump Party? That is the question that Mr. Bannon sees as defining this looming battle between conservatives. Bush/Rubio is shorthand for the establishment that Mr. Bannon loathes \u2014 the party that favors a softer, more inclusive approach toward immigration laws and a more active role for America in the global community. The Trump Party rejects those premises entirely.The establishment wing of the party considered these debates settled. What Mr. Trump did \u2014 and what Mr. Bannon helped draw out in Mr. Trump \u2014 was to force these issues and make Republicans take sides. We know what side won 2016. We don\u2019t know yet which will prevail in 2018 and beyond.BANNON: And by the way, the Gillespie campaign never really coordinated, never really reached out. The whole thing on the Trump stuff was a little bit grafted on.PETERS: I wonder if it was something of a problem of Gillespie himself because he was seen by conservatives as a creature of the swamp, so to speak, or of the establishment.BANNON: 100 percent. But even with the Trump people, this is the thing \u2014 I \u2014 I tried in \u2014 in the \u2014 the stories of Breitbart, in the other stories that came out on the other con \u2014 far-right news services. Is that even with the Trump people \u2014 and that\u2019s with the Corey Stewart. You \u2014 if you lose in a primary, you got to get over it. The only way this thing\u2019s going to work is to keep this coalition together.Even if Ed Gillespie had sold himself as a cloned Donald Trump, it still would not have been enough to win the governor\u2019s race in Virginia, illustrating the challenges of the Bannon/Trump model in swing states like Virginia with large, highly educated suburban populations.That model works well in rural states, in the South and central Plains. It worked \u2014 but just barely \u2014 in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where less than 80,000 votes delivered the White House to Mr. Trump. Whether it can work there again is Mr. Bannon\u2019s crucible.PETERS: So there\u2019s no doubt though that that message of President Trump\u2019s has appeal with white nationalists. Is that an unfortunate reality, an unintended consequence?BANNON: I think it\u2019s, I think it\u2019s, I think it\u2019s nonsense. I think it\u2019s nonsense.PETERS: You don\u2019t think he appeals to them at all?BANNON: I think these guys grab on to anything they can. No, the message is one of, this guy is the least racist guy I\u2019ve ever met. And nothing in the campaign, and nothing that he\u2019s done to date. That\u2019s all that\u2019s all left wing. That\u2019s MSNBC nonsense. And by the way, you can\u2019t help with a couple of, these guys are marginalia to marginalia. Right? So they\u2019ll grab onto anything \u2014 and by the way, every time they say Trump\u2019s name, MSNBC has got a camera on it and The New York Times has an article on it, right? Because you\u2019re obsessed with it.PETERS: You\u2019re saying it\u2019s a media fabrication.This is a question that will continue to dog Mr. Trump, Mr. Bannon and the politicians who wrap themselves in their agenda. Mr. Bannon has denounced and rejected white nationalism publicly, as has Mr. Trump.But they always try to shift the blame from the racist far right to their enemies \u2014 the radical left and the news media. This makes it seem as if they can never truly accept that there are racists and xenophobes who see something to admire in Mr. Trump and his beliefs. And it leaves the impression that they might be trying to signal something subtly to these people.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized a Washington Post article about Roy S. Moore, the Republican nominee for a United States Senate seat in Alabama, and his alleged contact with a minor. The Post reported Mr. Moore had a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl, including groping, not that he had sex with her.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pakistan Calls In Army to Help Restore Order After Violent Clashes in Islamabad", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAuthorities said at least six protesters were killed and 200 people \u2014 including dozens of police officers and paramilitary troops \u2014 were injured as stone-throwing crowds fought with police for control of a highway intersection. Clashes also broke out in other cities, including Lahore and Karachi, with officials saying at least 150 protesters have been arrested.As plumes of smoke rose from the site of the highway clashes, officials in Islamabad requested the help of the Army to \u201ccontrol the law-and-order situation\u201d in the capital, according the Ministry of Interior. The ministry said that the military authorities would determine the number of troops to be deployed.The demonstrations began three weeks ago after the release of a proposed new version of an oath to be taken by lawmakers that omitted mention of the Prophet Muhammad. The protesters, many of them supporters of the cleric, Khadim Hussain Rizvi, an outspoken Islamist, have demanded that the law minister resign for the omission, which they called blasphemy.Supporters of Mr. Rizvi\u2019s political party, Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan, have been camped at the Faizabad Interchange, blocking the main road from the capital, Islamabad, to neighboring Rawalpindi. They refused to clear the road until the government agreed to remove the law minister, Zahid Hamid, over the changed oath.As the standoff has escalated, protest leaders have stepped up their demands, and are now calling for the entire cabinet to resign.The omission in the new oath was quickly reversed, but Mr. Rizvi\u2019s supporters have continued to accuse the law minister of blasphemy \u2014 a highly combustible issue in Pakistan, and one that has repeatedly led to acts of violence.Saturday, Mr. Rizvi rallied his supporters from atop a trailer, shouting through a microphone and accusing the authorities of working on behalf of the United States.\u201cTrump says change Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy laws. Are you acting on his orders?\u201d he asked the police.At one point, the electronic media regulating authority took all television news networks off the air in most parts of the country, and Facebook, Twitter and YouTube were also inaccessible, amid concerns that live coverage of the police action was inflaming religious sentiments.The violence and spreading protests present a grave challenge to the country\u2019s governing party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz.At least 8,000 police officers in riot gear and a separate paramilitary police force that had encircled the approximately 2,000 protesters began trying to clear the protesters staging a sit-in on the main interchange in the city early on Saturday.Using water cannons, canisters of tear gas and slings, they managed to wrest back control of a large area. Dozens of tents burned. Thick smoke and tear gas could be seen from afar as protesters and police officers clashed, each side using stones and batons.But by midday, the balance seemed to have shifted back to the protesters, who remained in control of the main part of their camp. Dozens of officers were among the injured, officials said.As the protesters held their ground, Mr. Rizvi grew bolder and urged his supporters to bring the whole country to a standstill. Mr. Rizvi\u2019s speeches were broadcast on Facebook Live and helped to galvanize his supporters across the country.By Saturday evening, officials said the operation against the protesters in Islamabad had been suspended, and they denied that a police officer had died during the clashes, after local and foreign reports had published news of the death, attributing it to a police spokesman.Protesters also stormed the home of Mr. Hamid in Pasrur in Sialkot District. Neither the law minister nor his relatives were present at the time of the attack.Another lawmaker from the governing party, Mian Javid Latif, was attacked by protesters and injured in Sheikhupura District, the local news media reported. His condition was stable, they said. Local media outlets reported that protesters in Rawalpindi had damaged the entrance of the house of Nisar Ali Khan, a former interior minister.The Islamabad high court last week ordered the government to clear the interchange. But it has been reluctant to use force, fearful that violence could give more oxygen to the hard-line Islamists.The government has refused to fire Mr. Hamid, and negotiations for a peaceful end to the protests have been unsuccessful. Reversing the change in the law has failed to assuage the anger of religious leaders, especially Mr. Rizvi, who has used the controversy to expand his influence and outreach.The authorities said that protests had closed a road that connects Islamabad to the eastern city of Lahore, where hundreds of protesters burned tires and scuffled with the police. There were clashes in the southern port city of Karachi, according to media reports.Pakistan\u2019s politically powerful Army has urged the government to move cautiously. According to a military spokesman, the Army chief of staff, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, called Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Saturday.He urged him \u201cto handle the protest peacefully, avoiding violence from both sides as it is not in the national interest,\u201d the spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, said.Afrasiab Khattak, a prominent politician and newspaper columnist, said in an interview that the protests represented a coordinated effort to topple the government.\u201cIt is not a spontaneous protest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very well-planned move by the religious right and their supporters in the state system to use the clashes in Islamabad as a detonator for riots in other parts of the country, especially Punjab Province.\u201dHe remains popular, however, and his party has ruled out calling for early elections, a demand by opposition political parties.Mr. Khattak said the protesters belonged to the Barelvi sect of Sunni Muslims, who had formed the bulk of Mr. Sharif\u2019s support. \u201cBut now, the Barelvis have been pitted against Sharif\u2019s party,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the endgame.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Security Breach and Spilled Secrets Have Shaken the N.S.A. to Its Core", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "A serial leak of the agency\u2019s cyberweapons has damaged morale, slowed intelligence operations and resulted in hacking attacks on businesses and civilians worldwide.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jake Williams awoke last April in an Orlando, Fla., hotel where he was leading a training session. Checking Twitter, Mr. Williams, a cybersecurity expert, was dismayed to discover that he had been thrust into the middle of one of the worst security debacles ever to befall American intelligence.Mr. Williams had written on his company blog about the Shadow Brokers, a mysterious group that had somehow obtained many of the hacking tools the United States used to spy on other countries. Now the group had replied in an angry screed on Twitter. It identified him \u2014 correctly \u2014 as a former member of the National Security Agency\u2019s hacking group, Tailored Access Operations, or T.A.O., a job he had not publicly disclosed. Then the Shadow Brokers astonished him by dropping technical details that made clear they knew about highly classified hacking operations that he had conducted.America\u2019s largest and most secretive intelligence agency had been deeply infiltrated.\u201cThey had operational insight that even most of my fellow operators at T.A.O. did not have,\u201d said Mr. Williams, now with Rendition Infosec, a cybersecurity firm he founded. \u201cI felt like I\u2019d been kicked in the gut. Whoever wrote this either was a well-placed insider or had stolen a lot of operational data.\u201dThe jolt to Mr. Williams from the Shadow Brokers\u2019 riposte was part of a much broader earthquake that has shaken the N.S.A. to its core. Current and former agency officials say the Shadow Brokers disclosures, which began in August 2016, have been catastrophic for the N.S.A., calling into question its ability to protect potent cyberweapons and its very value to national security. The agency regarded as the world\u2019s leader in breaking into adversaries\u2019 computer networks failed to protect its own.\u201cThese leaks have been incredibly damaging to our intelligence and cyber capabilities,\u201d said Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary and director of the Central Intelligence Agency. \u201cThe fundamental purpose of intelligence is to be able to effectively penetrate our adversaries in order to gather vital intelligence. By its very nature, that only works if secrecy is maintained and our codes are protected.\u201dWith a leak of intelligence methods like the N.S.A. tools, Mr. Panetta said, \u201cEvery time it happens, you essentially have to start over.\u201dFifteen months into a wide-ranging investigation by the agency\u2019s counterintelligence arm, known as Q Group, and the F.B.I., officials still do not know whether the N.S.A. is the victim of a brilliantly executed hack, with Russia as the most likely perpetrator, an insider\u2019s leak, or both. Three employees have been arrested since 2015 for taking classified files, but there is fear that one or more leakers may still be in place. And there is broad agreement that the damage from the Shadow Brokers already far exceeds the harm to American intelligence done by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who fled with four laptops of classified material in 2013.Mr. Snowden\u2019s cascade of disclosures to journalists and his defiant public stance drew far more media coverage than this new breach. But Mr. Snowden released code words, while the Shadow Brokers have released the actual code; if he shared what might be described as battle plans, they have loosed the weapons themselves. Created at huge expense to American taxpayers, those cyberweapons have now been picked up by hackers from North Korea to Russia and shot back at the United States and its allies.Millions of people saw their computers shut down by ransomware, with demands for payments in digital currency to have their access restored. Tens of thousands of employees at Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo cookies, had their data completely wiped. FedEx reported that an attack on a European subsidiary had halted deliveries and cost $300 million. Hospitals in Pennsylvania, Britain and Indonesia had to turn away patients. The attacks disrupted production at a car plant in France, an oil company in Brazil and a chocolate factory in Tasmania, among thousands of enterprises affected worldwide.American officials had to explain to close allies \u2014 and to business leaders in the United States \u2014 how cyberweapons developed at Fort Meade in Maryland came to be used against them. Experts believe more attacks using the stolen N.S.A. tools are all but certain.Inside the agency\u2019s Maryland headquarters and its campuses around the country, N.S.A. employees have been subjected to polygraphs and suspended from their jobs in a hunt for turncoats allied with the Shadow Brokers. Much of the agency\u2019s arsenal is still being replaced, curtailing operations. Morale has plunged, and experienced specialists are leaving the agency for better-paying jobs \u2014 including with firms defending computer networks from intrusions that use the N.S.A.\u2019s leaked tools.\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster on multiple levels,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing that the people responsible for this have not been brought to justice.\u201dIn response to detailed questions, an N.S.A. spokesman, Michael T. Halbig, said the agency \u201ccannot comment on Shadow Brokers.\u201d He denied that the episode had hurt morale. \u201cN.S.A. continues to be viewed as a great place to work; we receive more than 140,000 applications each year for our hiring program,\u201d he said.One passage, possibly hinting at the Shadow Brokers\u2019 identity, underscored the close relationship of Russian intelligence to criminal hackers. \u201cRussian security peoples,\u201d it said, \u201cis becoming Russian hackeres at nights, but only full moons.\u201dRussia is the prime suspect in a parallel hemorrhage of hacking tools and secret documents from the C.I.A.\u2019s Center for Cyber Intelligence, posted week after week since March to the WikiLeaks website under the names Vault7 and Vault8. That breach, too, is unsolved. Together, the flood of digital secrets from agencies that invest huge resources in preventing such breaches is raising profound questions.Have hackers and leakers made secrecy obsolete? Has Russian intelligence simply outplayed the United States, penetrating the most closely guarded corners of its government? Can a work force of thousands of young, tech-savvy spies ever be immune to leaks?Some veteran intelligence officials believe a lopsided focus on offensive weapons and hacking tools has, for years, left American cyberdefense dangerously porous.\u201cWe have had a train wreck coming,\u201d said Mike McConnell, the former N.S.A. director and national intelligence director. \u201cWe should have ratcheted up the defense parts significantly.\u201dAt the heart of the N.S.A. crisis is Tailored Access Operations, the group where Mr. Williams worked, which was absorbed last year into the agency\u2019s new Directorate of Operations.T.A.O. \u2014 the outdated name is still used informally \u2014 began years ago as a side project at the agency\u2019s research and engineering building at Fort Meade. It was a cyber Skunk Works, akin to the special units that once built stealth aircraft and drones. As Washington\u2019s need for hacking capabilities grew, T.A.O. expanded into a separate office park in Laurel, Md., with additional teams at facilities in Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii and Texas.The hacking unit attracts many of the agency\u2019s young stars, who like the thrill of internet break-ins in the name of national security, according to a dozen former government officials who agreed to describe its work on the condition of anonymity. T.A.O. analysts start with a shopping list of desired information and likely sources \u2014 say, a Chinese official\u2019s home computer or a Russian oil company\u2019s network. Much of T.A.O.\u2019s work is labeled E.C.I., for \u201cexceptionally controlled information,\u201d material so sensitive it was initially stored only in safes. When the cumulative weight of the safes threatened the integrity of N.S.A.\u2019s engineering building a few years ago, one agency veteran said, the rules were changed to allow locked file cabinets.The more experienced T.A.O. operators devise ways to break into foreign networks; junior operators take over to extract information. Mr. Williams, 40, a former paramedic who served in military intelligence in the Army before joining the N.S.A., worked in T.A.O. from 2008 to 2013, which he described as an especially long tenure. He called the work \u201cchallenging and sometimes exciting.\u201dT.A.O. operators must constantly renew their arsenal to stay abreast of changing software and hardware, examining every Windows update and new iPhone for vulnerabilities. \u201cThe nature of the business is to move with the technology,\u201d a former T.A.O. hacker said.Long known mainly as an eavesdropping agency, the N.S.A. has embraced hacking as an especially productive way to spy on foreign targets. The intelligence collection is often automated, with malware implants \u2014 computer code designed to find material of interest \u2014 left sitting on the targeted system for months or even years, sending files back to the N.S.A.The same implant can be used for many purposes: to steal documents, tap into email, subtly change data or become the launching pad for an attack. T.A.O.\u2019s most public success was an operation against Iran called Olympic Games, in which implants in the network of the Natanz nuclear plant caused centrifuges enriching uranium to self-destruct. The T.A.O. was also critical to attacks on the Islamic State and North Korea.It was this arsenal that the Shadow Brokers got hold of, and then began to release.Like cops studying a burglar\u2019s operating style and stash of stolen goods, N.S.A. analysts have tried to figure out what the Shadow Brokers took. None of the leaked files date from later than 2013 \u2014 a relief to agency officials assessing the damage. But they include a large share of T.A.O.\u2019s collection, including three so-called ops disks \u2014 T.A.O.\u2019s term for tool kits \u2014 containing the software to bypass computer firewalls, penetrate Windows and break into the Linux systems most commonly used on Android phones.Evidence shows that the Shadow Brokers obtained the entire tool kits intact, suggesting that an insider might have simply pocketed a thumb drive and walked out.But other files obtained by the Shadow Brokers bore no relation to the ops disks and seem to have been grabbed at different times. Some were designed for a compromise by the N.S.A. of Swift, a global financial messaging system, allowing the agency to track bank transfers. There was a manual for an old system code-named UNITEDRAKE, used to attack Windows. There were PowerPoint presentations and other files not used in hacking, making it unlikely that the Shadow Brokers had simply grabbed tools left on the internet by sloppy N.S.A. hackers.Some officials doubt that the Shadow Brokers got it all by hacking the most secure of American government agencies \u2014 hence the search for insiders. But some T.A.O. hackers think that skilled, persistent attackers might have been able to get through the N.S.A.\u2019s defenses \u2014 because, as one put it, \u201cI know we\u2019ve done it to other countries.\u201dThe Shadow Brokers have verbally attacked certain experts, including Mr. Williams. When he concluded from their Twitter hints that they knew about some of his hacks while at the N.S.A., he canceled a business trip to Singapore. The United States had named and criminally charged hackers from the intelligence agencies of China, Iran and Russia. He feared he could be similarly charged by a country he had targeted and arrested on an international warrant.He has since resumed traveling abroad. But he says no one from the N.S.A. has contacted him about being singled out publicly by the Shadow Brokers.\u201cThat feels like a betrayal,\u201d he said. \u201cI was targeted by the Shadow Brokers because of that work. I do not feel the government has my back.\u201dFor decades after its creation in 1952, the N.S.A. \u2014 No Such Agency, in the old joke \u2014 was seen as all but leakproof. But since Mr. Snowden flew away with hundreds of thousands of documents in 2013, that notion has been shattered.The Snowden trauma led to the investment of millions of dollars in new technology and tougher rules to counter what the government calls the insider threat. But N.S.A. employees say that with thousands of employees pouring in and out of the gates, and the ability to store a library\u2019s worth of data in a device that can fit on a key ring, it is impossible to prevent people from walking out with secrets.Mr. Martin\u2019s gargantuan collection of stolen files included much of what the Shadow Brokers have, and he has been scrutinized by investigators as a possible source for them. Officials say they do not believe he deliberately supplied the material, though they have examined whether he might have been targeted by thieves or hackers.But according to former N.S.A. employees who are still in touch with active workers, investigators of the Shadow Brokers thefts are clearly worried that one or more leakers may still be inside the agency. Some T.A.O. employees have been asked to turn over their passports, take time off their jobs and submit to questioning. The small number of specialists who have worked both at T.A.O. and at the C.I.A. have come in for particular attention, out of concern that a single leaker might be responsible for both the Shadow Brokers and the C.I.A.\u2019s Vault7 breaches.Then there are the Shadow Brokers\u2019 writings, which betray a seeming immersion in American culture. Last April, about the time Mr. Williams was discovering their inside knowledge of T.A.O. operations, the Shadow Brokers posted an appeal to President Trump: \u201cDon\u2019t Forget Your Base.\u201d With the ease of a seasoned pundit, they tossed around details about Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s now departed adviser; the Freedom Caucus in Congress; the \u201cdeep state\u201d; the Alien and Sedition Acts; and white privilege.\u201cTheShadowBrokers is wanting to see you succeed,\u201d the post said, addressing Mr. Trump. \u201cTheShadowBrokers is wanting America to be great again.\u201dThe mole hunt is inevitably creating an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety, former employees say. While the attraction of the N.S.A. for skilled operators is unique \u2014 nowhere else can they hack without getting into legal trouble \u2014 the boom in cybersecurity hiring by private companies gives T.A.O. veterans lucrative exit options.Young T.A.O. hackers are lucky to make $80,000 a year, while those who leave routinely find jobs paying well over $100,000, security specialists say. For many workers, the appeal of the N.S.A\u2019s mission has been more than enough to make up the difference. But over the past year, former T.A.O. employees say an increasing number of former colleagues have called them looking for private-sector work, including \u201cgraybeards\u201d they thought would be N.S.A. lifers.\u201cSnowden killed morale,\u201d another T.A.O. analyst said. \u201cBut at least we knew who he was. Now you have a situation where the agency is questioning people who have been 100 percent mission-oriented, telling them they\u2019re liars.\u201dBecause the N.S.A. hacking unit has grown so rapidly over the past decade, the pool of potential leakers has expanded into the hundreds. Trust has eroded as anyone who had access to the leaked code is regarded as the potential culprit.Some agency veterans have seen projects they worked on for a decade shut down because implants they relied on were dumped online by the Shadow Brokers. The number of new operations has declined because the malware tools must be rebuilt. And no end is in sight.\u201cHow much longer are the releases going to come?\u201d a former T.A.O. employee asked. \u201cThe agency doesn\u2019t know how to stop it \u2014 or even what \u2018it\u2019 is.\u201dOne N.S.A. official who almost saw his career ended by the Shadow Brokers is at the very top of the organization: Adm. Michael S. Rogers, director of the N.S.A. and commander of its sister military organization, United States Cyber Command. President Barack Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., and defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, recommended removing Admiral Rogers from his post to create accountability for the breaches.But Mr. Obama did not act on the advice, in part because Admiral Rogers\u2019s agency was at the center of the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump, who again on Saturday disputed his intelligence agencies\u2019 findings on Russia and the election, extended the admiral\u2019s time in office. Some former intelligence officials say they are flabbergasted that he has been able to hold on to his job.Lurking in the background of the Shadow Brokers investigation is American officials\u2019 strong belief that it is a Russian operation. The pattern of dribbling out stolen documents over many months, they say, echoes the slow release of Democratic emails purloined by Russian hackers last year.But there is a more specific back story to the United States-Russia rivalry.Starting in 2014, American security researchers who had been tracking Russia\u2019s state-sponsored hacking groups for years began to expose them in a series of research reports. American firms, including Symantec, CrowdStrike and FireEye, reported that Moscow was behind certain attacks and identified government-sponsored Russian hacking groups.In the meantime, Russia\u2019s most prominent cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, had started work on a report that would turn the tables on the United States. Kaspersky hunted for the spying malware planted by N.S.A. hackers, guided in part by the keywords and code names in the files taken by Mr. Snowden and published by journalists, officials said.So T.A.O. personnel rushed to replace implants in many countries with new malware they did not believe the Russian company could detect.In February 2015, Kaspersky published its report on the Equation Group \u2014 the company\u2019s name for T.A.O. hackers \u2014 and updated its antivirus software to uproot the N.S.A. malware wherever it had not been replaced. The agency temporarily lost access to a considerable flow of intelligence. By some accounts, however, N.S.A. officials were relieved that the Kaspersky report did not include certain tools they feared the Russian company had found.As it would turn out, any celebration was premature.On Aug. 13 last year, a new Twitter account using the Shadow Brokers\u2019 name announced with fanfare an online auction of stolen N.S.A. hacking tools.\u201cWe hack Equation Group,\u201d the Shadow Brokers wrote. \u201cWe find many many Equation Group cyber weapons.\u201dInside the N.S.A., the declaration was like a bomb exploding. A zip file posted online contained the first free sample of the agency\u2019s hacking tools. It was immediately evident that the Shadow Brokers were not hoaxsters, and that the agency was in trouble.The leaks have renewed a debate over whether the N.S.A. should be permitted to stockpile vulnerabilities it discovers in commercial software to use for spying \u2014 rather than immediately alert software makers so the holes can be plugged. The agency claims it has shared with the industry more than 90 percent of flaws it has found, reserving only the most valuable for its own hackers. But if it can\u2019t keep those from leaking, as the last year has demonstrated, the resulting damage to businesses and ordinary computer users around the world can be colossal. The Trump administration says it will soon announce revisions to the system, making it more transparent.Mr. Williams said it may be years before the \u201cfull fallout\u201d of the Shadow Brokers breach is understood. Even the arrest of whoever is responsible for the leaks may not end them, he said \u2014 because the sophisticated perpetrators may have built a \u201cdead man\u2019s switch\u201d to release all remaining files automatically upon their arrest.\u201cWe\u2019re obviously dealing with people who have operational security knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the whole law enforcement system and intelligence system after them. And they haven\u2019t been caught.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pakistan Deploys Military Troops After Violent Clashes in Islamabad", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistan deployed army troops in Islamabad on Sunday to help restore law and order to the capital, officials said, a day after violent clashes between the police and supporters of an Islamic cleric left at least six people dead and 200 others injured.The move came after the prime minister and army officials held emergency talks and agreed to send troops to protect vital areas and buildings like Parliament, the prime minister\u2019s residence and the diplomatic enclave that houses embassies.The military informed the governing party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, that it would rule out the use of lethal force to quell the protest, according to the terms of the deployment in a letter that was shared with The New York Times and circulated by the local news media.A military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, said the army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, had urged Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi \u201cto handle the protest peacefully, avoiding violence from both sides as it is not in the national interest.\u201dA military official confirmed on Sunday: \u201cThe army will remain at the backstage. We will not use force against the protesters. We will just protect important government installations.\u201d The official insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media about the protest, which has presented a potentially major crisis for the governing party.The protests erupted over two weeks ago, when the cleric, Khadim Hussain Rizvi, accused the nation\u2019s law minister, Zahid Hamid, of committing blasphemy after the governing party proposed a new version of an oath for lawmakers that dealt with a declaration of Prophet Muhammad as God\u2019s final prophet.The law minister denied the blasphemy charge, even releasing a video in which he emphatically stated that he believed that Muhammad was God\u2019s final prophet. The government also reversed the changes in the oath. But the efforts failed to placate Mr. Rizvi and several other religious leaders.They demanded his resignation, but the government refused.Blasphemy remains highly contentious in Pakistan, often leading to violence and mob justice. In recent years, hard-line Islamists have killed two prominent politicians who advocated changes in the country\u2019s laws.On Saturday, protesters stormed the home of Mr. Hamid, in Pasrur in Sialkot District, but he was not there at the time. Another lawmaker from the governing party, Mian Javid Latif, was injured in an attack by protesters in Sheikhupura District, local news outlets reported. Protesters in Rawalpindi also damaged the entrance of the house of a former interior minister, Nisar Ali Khan.On Sunday, pressure grew for Mr. Hamid to step down. Imran Khan, the leader of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, called for his resignation, adding his voice to the cleric\u2019s.Mr. Rizvi, who belongs to the Barelvi sect and built his reputation as a staunch defender of the country\u2019s blasphemy laws, was a virtual unknown a few years ago. He has since gained considerable political clout, becoming leader of the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan party. His sermons have been filled with invectives against religious minorities and opponents.In September, Mr. Rizvi\u2019s party entered a by-election in Lahore, in eastern Pakistan, for the seat vacated after the ouster of the governing party\u2019s leader, Nawaz Sharif. To the surprise of many observers, it won more than 7,000 votes, or 6 percent.The relatively strong showing appears to have emboldened Mr. Rizvi, and he used the controversy over the electoral oath to unleash supporters on the capital, where they\u2019ve been camped out for weeks, crippling traffic.The Islamabad high court had ordered the government to clear the interchange since last week. But on Saturday, as nearly 8,000 police officers and members of a paramilitary force moved in to remove the protesters, both sides attacked each other with sticks, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets, and tents burned.The police suspended the operation.The spasm of violence raised concerns about the stability of the governing party, which was weakened by the disqualification of Mr. Sharif in July. Political analysts say the current turmoil would worsen if the government did not take steps to calm the unrest.A regulator had banned live television coverage in most of the country of the police operation for fear it was inflaming religious sentiment. But many news networks taken off the air have since resumed broadcasts.All colleges and universities in Punjab Province will be closed on Monday and Tuesday, the provincial authorities announced. Twitter, Facebook and YouTube remained inaccessible Sunday, but officials had planned to unblock the platforms by evening.On Sunday afternoon, an uneasy calm prevailed in Islamabad. The aftermath of the clashes was visible in the charred grass on the sidewalks and burned tents. Boxes of food and plastic bottles of water were scattered on the ground.Supporters of Mr. Rizvi roamed about the Faizabad Interchange, one of the main entrances to the capital from Rawalpindi and its suburbs, with an air of victory.\u201cGovernment used all kinds of force and thousands of personnel, but by the grace of Allah, they ran like rats when the believers of the Prophet Muhammad retaliated,\u201d one protester, Muhammad Zubair, said.About 2,000 people at the protest site offered funeral prayers for those killed in Saturday\u2019s clashes.Abid Hussain, a seminary leader who was leading a group of about 100 protesters, said, \u201cWe will avenge the martyrdom of our six fellows by continuing the protest.\u201dAs a helicopter flew overheard, dozens of protesters turned their eyes toward the sky, raised their arms and shouted, \u201cI am here, O Prophet of God, I am here,\u201d a defining slogan of Mr. Rizvi\u2019s party.Residents from neighboring towns and cities, who said they wanted to show solidarity with the protesters, streamed to the protest site to join the sit-in.The demonstrators seemed emboldened by that fact that protesters had managed to repulse Saturday\u2019s advance by the police forces. Protest leaders have now stepped up their demands.They are calling for the entire cabinet to resign.Ihsanullah Tipu Mehsud contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arrests Raise Questions, Broadcom\u2019s Qualcomm Bid: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning. Andrew has thoughts on the detention of Prince Alwaleed of Saudi Arabia over the weekend, especially after interviewing the billionaire less than two weeks ago. And we\u2019re looking at the fallout from the Paradise Papers leaks.Two weeks ago, he seemed remarkably relaxed, no different than the few times I had interacted with him beforehand. He did make a point of praising Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his Vision 2030 plan for the country. He also was particularly spirited in his praise of President Trump, someone whom he had once called a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and had called upon to drop out of the presidential race.One thing that was surprising, given that Prince Alwaleed had been the face of finance for Saudi Arabia for years, was that he was not part of the large investment conference organized by Crown Prince Mohammed. The gathering took place at the Ritz-Carlton \u2014 just 10 minutes down the road from Alwaleed\u2019s office.\u201cThis is very risky,\u201d the business leader said, because M.B.S. is now challenging senior princes and religious conservatives simultaneously. The executive, who strongly supports M.B.S.\u2019s liberalization efforts, worried that \u201che\u2019s fighting too many wars at once.\u201dMore on Alwaleed and the Saudi detentions__________________________________________But Andrew and Michael have spoken with others, including executives and investors in New York \u2014 some of whom have had long relationships with Prince Alwaleed \u2014 who suggested that the arrests will make the business community less certain about investing in Saudi Arabia.Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, who attended the Riyadh conference, was somewhat more circumspect. \u201cDoes this scare off a pension fund or can this be sold as creating the necessary conditions of success?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-stakes game.\u201dMore on AramcoMichael says that Qualcomm is expected to quickly reject the bid as too low. But deal makers have been whispering about how Broadcom and its C.E.O., Hock Tan, may have been laying the political groundwork for this deal.More smart things to think about\u2022 Pay attention to any role that Silver Lake, which has backed Mr. Tan for 12 years, plays in supporting Broadcom\u2019s bid. Private equity firms usually don\u2019t back unsolicited takeover offers, but will this time be different?\u2022 If Broadcom wins, will it be able to strike a peace deal with Apple, which has been in a long-running legal fight with Qualcomm?Wilbur Ross Other Trump administration officialsBoth Gary Cohn, who was associated with 22 Bermuda entities while an executive at Goldman Sachs, and Rex Tillerson, who was a director of a Bermuda-based joint venture with the government of Yemen when he ran Exxon Mobil\u2019s operations there, appear in the files.

{"Headline": "The Running Bubble Has Popped. (You Couldn\u2019t Hear It in New York.)", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout 50,000 runners started the New York City Marathon on Sunday \u2014 and they were the lucky ones. Only 17 percent of those who had entered a drawing that fills a third of the field were selected, and applications for those spots were up about 20 percent over the year before, according to race organizers.But not every race is so popular. Road races have hit the wall. The number of finishers in events in the United States has fallen from a peak of about 19 million in 2013 to just over 17 million in 2016.High fees, a glut of race options and competition from other fitness activities have shrunk the fields at many races.\u201cIt\u2019s possible we got too big too fast,\u201d said Rich Harshbarger, the chief executive of Running USA, an industry group. Road races saw 300 percent growth in the number of finishers from 1990 to 2013, with a concentrated boom from 2008 to 2013. As participation recedes, Harshbarger expects some races to fold.\u201cWe\u2019ve still seen supply outstrip demand, and I think that\u2019s going to change next year,\u201d Harshbarger added.Finish Line Sports sold its specialty running division in January, and the Rodale publishing company shuttered Running Times magazine last year. City Sports, an apparel retailer that catered to runners, filed for bankruptcy in 2015.Most of running\u2019s decline has come in what Running USA labeled the \u201cother\u201d distance \u2014 nontraditional events like mud runs and color runs. They account for about one million of the lost road-race finishers, Harshbarger said. He added that the problem was not necessarily that fewer people were running, but that they were doing it less often in organized events that charge fees.\u201cEvents that aren\u2019t professional managed or professional produced are going away, and then those left in the market are forced to get more creative,\u201d he said. \u201cNow everyone\u2019s got bands on the course and beer at the finish line, so what\u2019s new?\u201dRoad races are also experiencing competition from things like studio classes, group yoga and CrossFit. High fees for races have also become an issue. In 2006, the average five-kilometer race cost $13.50, according to Road Race Management, an industry publication. Now the average is $34. In 2006, the average marathon cost $69.97. That\u2019s now $123.In a 2017 survey, Running USA found that 20 percent of runners expected to decrease their race participation. Half of the runners in the survey said they thought that races were too expensive and that cost was a top 10 factor in deciding whether or not to register for a race. The survey also indicated that six in 10 runners would participate in more races if fees were low.\u201cBack when you could enter a road race for $10 and you could enter a marathon for $25, the sport really had no appeal or very little appeal for for-profit businesses,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBut then we moved into an era where people would pay $85 for a half and $135 for a marathon. That\u2019s when you really had all the for-profit groups, and it just transformed the model.\u201dJean Knaack, the executive director of the Road Runners Club of America, said that running is \u201cat the plateau.\u201d\u201cWhile we\u2019re seeing the decline on the event side,\u201d she said, \u201cpeople are still staying active in their clubs.\u201dLess formal running groups are also creating opportunities that compete with paid events. Dave Welsh, the owner of three stores in South Jersey that cater to runners, said that after three years of decline, his business had leveled off. While he still sees a lot of interest in the sport, he also recognizes that free races or group runs are likely to lure people away from events with fees.The athletic event industry is expected to grow by 1.7 percent over the next five years, according to IBISWorld, a market research group. The category comprises running, walking, cycling and multi-activity events like triathlons, with running events making up 41.8 percent, said Rory Masterson, the lead analyst at IBISWorld.\u201cThere\u2019s been a significant increase in variety of events,\u201d Masterson said, adding that road races would have to keep battling for participants \u2014 and dollars \u2014 within that realm.\u201cThose races are still selling out, which is a testament that the sport is still strong,\u201d Knaack said. \u201cBut they can\u2019t get any bigger. I think people are still gravitating toward those races because they know they\u2019re going to get the bang for their buck.\u201dNot every road race, she added, will have such robust support.\u201cA lot of what happened is during the massive rise, you got a lot of opportunists that hopped in thinking that I\u2019ll put on an event and make a gazillion dollars,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how the industry works. Just because you built it doesn\u2019t mean that people will come.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Mr. Arroyo says the process creates greater consistency.) Feedback from taproom customers helped Heritage fine-tune its technique before starting Veritas in 2015.A year ago, Modern Times set aside part of its taproom in the Point Loma section of San Diego for a cafe. It opens at 8 a.m. daily and sells flights of cold-brew and pour-over coffee made with beans that it ages in rum barrels.The approach borrows serving styles and flavoring techniques from the beer world, enticing customers with a different kind of buzz. \u201cPeople that come into our tasting room for beer are really excited about trying our coffee once they\u2019re here,\u201d said Mr. McKean, who noted that the brewery has extended its cafe hours to 5 p.m. It\u2019s \u201cdefinitely awesome\u201d to have nonalcoholic options in the tasting room, said Mr. McKean, who will offer coffee at forthcoming outposts in Los Angeles; Encinitas, Calif.; and Portland, Ore.\u201cIt\u2019s not running 24 hours a day,\u201d Mr. McKean said. \u201cBy canning coffee, we\u2019re finding another way to put that equipment into use when otherwise it would\u2019ve been idle.\u201dWhether coffee or beer, all Modern Times products share similar logos and labeling. In Pennsylvania, Vault and Pretty Bird stay distinct brands, even though the production brewery and roastery share the same building, and coffee regularly finds its way into beers like the Breakfast Stout, also starring oats and maple syrup. The aim is to let both companies stand on their own.\u201cThe intention isn\u2019t to say, \u2018Vault does beer really well, so they should be able to do coffee really well,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Cain, the Vault owner. \u201cTo us, Pretty Bird means good coffee and Vault means good beer.\u201dCommunity sits at the heart of coffee and beer. \u201cYou sit around in the morning with a cup of coffee, then you sit around at night with a glass of beer,\u201d Mr. Arroyo said. \u201cTo merge those two cultures just seems natural.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Panic After Trump\u2019s Account Is Deleted Caps a Rough Week", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the company, customer service representatives, public relations managers and executives \u2014 including Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey \u2014 were bombarded by people asking what had happened to the president\u2019s account, which Mr. Trump regularly uses as a megaphone for all manner of matters. No one had answers, according to current and former Twitter employees who were involved or briefed on the situation, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were private.Only after further review did executives discover that it was a contractor who was leaving Twitter that day who had disabled Mr. Trump\u2019s account, said the people involved in the matter.The incident immediately made the unnamed contractor a hero to some and a villain to others for muting, even temporarily, Mr. Trump. Yet the outcome for Twitter was black and white: It was another fiasco that the social media company had to clean up.Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s deleted account showed how empty some of those promises seemed. Late Thursday, Twitter employees gathered in private Slack channels and used Twitter to send direct messages to one another to remark on how insecure Mr. Trump\u2019s account had been, according to people involved in the conversations. Hundreds of employees can access the accounts of so-called Very Important Tweeters and can take actions like disabling the accounts, according to the current and former employees.Mr. Trump, for his part, remarked that the incident reflected the impact his Twitter messages have had. He tweeted with gusto on Friday, firing off more than a dozen messages over the course of the day on issues including ISIS and Hillary Clinton.The discovery that it was a contractor who deleted Mr. Trump\u2019s account is difficult for Twitter, as well as other technology companies. Nearly every major technology company including Google, Facebook and Apple relies on contract employees to fill positions. In general, the jobs tend to be nontechnical roles such as customer support or administrative and operational positions.Many of these workers are brought on by staffing companies like Accenture, Adecco and Cognizant and work on renewable one-year contracts. Facebook, Twitter and other companies also outsource content review to third-party services like ProUnlimited and Cognizant, which are essentially internet call centers staffed with hundreds of workers who deal with customer service issues.Many of these people work side by side with full-time employees, but they are often paid significantly less, are identified with different color employee badges, and are not afforded the same perks and amenities that full-time workers have. Many complain of being treated like second-class citizens.At the congressional hearings this week, Facebook and Twitter had discussed how they planned to hire more people to help prohibit the misuse of their platforms. Facebook said it was hiring an additional 10,000 workers to review flagged content, bringing the total to 20,000 by the end of 2018.At Twitter, employees have long expressed concern about the widely available nature of internal tools for handling customer accounts. Disabling an account is typically an easy two- or three-step process, according to current and former Twitter employees. Certain teams at the company \u2014 including trust and safety, and operations \u2014 have access to all accounts including the highest levels.Twitter customer support cannot, however, access customers\u2019 private direct messages, nor can it tweet on behalf of other users, these people said.In the past, Twitter has discussed adding additional layers of security that would prohibit wide internal access to V.I.T. accounts, according to these people. That included a kind of \u201cdual layer\u201d of security, requiring assurances from multiple employees to make significant changes to accounts.In the end, the company did not follow through with the plans, these people said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ben Shapiro, a Provocative \u2018Gladiator,\u2019 Battles to Win Young Conservatives", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Benjamin Shapiro strode down the aisle of a packed auditorium at the University of Utah like a prizefighter walking toward a ring. He was dressed in a dark suit jacket and a gray shirt and was followed closely by a bodyguard. The mostly male audience sprung to its feet, cheering him with thunderous applause.After his speech \u2014 a searing critique of mainstream liberalism \u2014 a young man walked up to the microphone.\u201cI have watched so many of your videos I think my girlfriend hates you,\u201d he said.Mr. Shapiro, conservative thinker, entertainer, trash talker and destroyer of weak arguments, has been called the voice of the conservative millennial movement. He represents the tastes of an emerging political class: If Rush Limbaugh is someone your dad listens to on his car radio, Mr. Shapiro, 33, a graduate of Harvard Law School, is the cool kid\u2019s philosopher, dissecting arguments with a lawyer\u2019s skill and references to Aristotle. He exists in places that young people inhabit \u2014 podcasts, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. His podcast, The Ben Shapiro Show, is downloaded 10 million times every month. Seventy percent of his audience is under the age of 40.Mr. Shapiro is trying to define conservatism at a time when its meaning is up for grabs and the Republican Party, and traditional conservative media outlets like Fox, are built for older audiences. He does not like President Trump and he disagrees with his old boss at Breitbart News, Stephen K. Bannon, that Trumpism is the future of the Republican Party. He likes to point out that Mr. Trump won fewer votes in Wisconsin than Mitt Romney in 2012 and fewer votes in Michigan than George W. Bush in 2004. Most Republicans voted for Mr. Trump not because they loved him, he argues, but because they hated Hillary Clinton.But he is not a moderate. His views are extremely conservative: Transgenderism is a mental illness, as per the encyclopedia of mental disorders before 2013. Yes, blacks have been historically discriminated against. No, institutions are not broadly discriminating against them today. The rich pay too much tax. Abortion should be illegal. Social Security ought to be privatized and Obamacare repealed.Liberals loathe Mr. Shapiro. They say he is a pugilist who has built his brand on the nation\u2019s addiction to outrage. He is part of an industry that whips up conservatives against the left, they say, and the fact that his audience is mostly young will deepen the divide for years to come.And even some former fans say Mr. Shapiro is a brilliant polemicist, but in a tribal nation, he\u2019s just one more partisan mobilizing his troops.\u201cThere\u2019s a real battle for hearts and minds going on right now and Ben is one of the main warriors,\u201d said David French, a columnist for National Review. Mr. French calls Mr. Shapiro a \u201cprincipled gladiator.\u201d His aggressive tone draws in audiences, he said, but he does not attack unfairly, stoke anger for the sake of it, or mischaracterize his opponents\u2019 positions. He even hits his own side, as he did with Sean Hannity for not weighing in on Roy S. Moore, the embattled Alabama Republican, and Mr. Bannon for supporting him.\u201cHe appeals to the better angels of his audience\u2019s nature, while still being a pugilist, and that\u2019s quite a skill,\u201d Mr. French said.Mr. Shapiro grew up in Los Angeles in a Jewish family of Reagan Republicans. His parents both worked in Hollywood, his mother as an executive of a TV company and his father as a composer. They lived in a small house, his parents in one bedroom and he and his three sisters in the other. They had political discussions around the dinner table. He was patriotic. He dressed up as John Adams every year for Halloween from the age of 5. He had a favorite musical: 1776.He is less established than Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh, but his audience is younger. And instead of hunkering down in a studio, Mr. Shapiro travels the country, speaking at colleges (he\u2019s been to 37 since early last year) and on panels.\u201cSo often I\u2019ve felt turning on Fox, it makes you dumber, but you listen to Ben Shapiro and you are likely to be both entertained and enlightened,\u201d said Charlie Sykes, a conservative pundit and Trump critic. \u201cHe\u2019s high octane. He reads books. His mind works really fast. He likes to get under people\u2019s skin. He\u2019s clearly part of this younger generation. I could imagine Bill Buckley looking down and smiling.\u201dPeople often discover Mr. Shapiro by seeing a video clip of him arguing with somebody. Some have been watched millions of times, like one from a college in Michigan in February. After a back and forth with a young woman in the audience about transgenderism, Mr. Shapiro asked her how old she was. She said 22.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you 60?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat is the problem with you identifying as 60?\u201dThe young woman looked at him and hesitated, lowering the microphone slightly.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same as gender,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just \u2026\u201dMr. Shapiro looked at her, his face impassive: \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t magically change your gender. You can\u2019t magically change your sex. You can\u2019t magically change your age.\u201dIn an age of partisan warfare on college campuses, this video clip is a rare weapon. It is also vintage Shapiro. He takes apart arguments in ways that makes the conservative conclusion seem utterly logical, like putting a key in a locked door. The clip has had about 47 million views on Facebook.\u201cThere is a hunger in conservative millennial land for a different kind of voice,\u201d Mr. French said. \u201cThey want someone who will unapologetically stand up for conservative values, but who is also articulating a movement they can feel proud of.\u201dMr. Shapiro has always been deeply conservative and does not pretend to be objective. But he says his market niche is giving cleareyed reads of current events, not purely partisan rants. He is often compared to his former colleague at Breitbart, Milo Yiannopoulos. On the surface, they seem the same. Both speak on college campuses. Both draw protests. Both used to work for Mr. Bannon at Breitbart. Both are young.In fact, they are very different. Mr. Yiannopoulos, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Bannon, was good at shocking audiences, saying things like \u201cfeminism is cancer.\u201d But critics say that he was empty of ideas, a kind of nihilistic rodeo clown who was not even conservative. Mr. Shapiro broke with Mr. Bannon last year, saying Breitbart had become a propaganda tool for Mr. Trump.Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s act collapsed this year. But the fact that it lasted so long says a lot about the right\u2019s fury against mainstream liberalism, Mr. Shapiro said.Years of cultural dominance in TV, movies, comedy, media and to a large extent, universities, left conservatives feeling looked down on and labeled. Mr. Shapiro, who still lives in Los Angeles, wrote a book about it, \u201cPrimetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV.\u201d Add to that economic frustration, and taboos around race, gender and sexual orientation, and you start to explain Mr. Limbaugh\u2019s explosive success 20 years ago.\u201cTrump won the nomination because he was anti-left, not because of any political viewpoints,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said in an interview. \u201cHe was slapping people on the left and people on the right went, \u2018Yeah, those people need to be slapped!\u2019\u201dBut Mr. Shapiro does it too. He thinks it\u2019s easy to provoke the left, which he says has become intellectually flabby after decades of cultural dominance. It\u2019s not good at arguing and relies instead on taboos and punishing people who violate them. That is the essence of his stump speech.\u201cThe left believes in a hierarchy of victimhood,\u201d he said in Utah. \u201cIf you are L.G.B.T.Q., then we suggest that you are very top of the victimhood hierarchy. You have been most victimized in the United States and therefore your opinion must be taken with the most gravitas.\u201dHe ticked off others.\u201cBlack folks have been historically victimized in the United States, which of course, is true. But the idea that every black person now is being individually victimized by the United States is not true.\u201dThen he got to the group that made up most of the audience.\u201cWay down at the bottom are white straight males. Those are people whose opinions do not matter at all. Because those are the people who are the beneficiaries of the system. They don\u2019t get to talk about the system because they were the ones who built the system.\u201dCritics say that is great red meat for his audience, but it\u2019s nonsense. Even if straight white males are low on the left\u2019s pecking order, they have most of the power in Washington, in statehouses, in every corporate boardroom. They run America.Mr. Shapiro says he\u2019s about more than tribal polemics. In an age of combative politics, you have to be a fighter to be in the game. And he says he\u2019s willing to defend conservatism against those on the right as well as the left.\u201cI am trying to militantly defend conservative ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be anti-left for the sake of it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the tweets received by Mr. Shapiro. He received 38 percent of all anti-Semitic tweets aimed at journalists in 2016; not of tweets overall.Andy Mills contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}

Increasingly, it also serves as an example of how difficult that task can be.This week, the jobs-and-professional-networking service blocked individuals from advertising jobs on its site in China, after it ran afoul of new government regulations requiring it to verify the individuals\u2019 identities, according to a person familiar with the situation. LinkedIn said in a statement that companies could still post job listings but that it did not know when it would again allow individuals to do the same.In August, China\u2019s government increased scrutiny on internet job postings in response to a rash of online hiring scams, mostly for pyramid schemes. New regulations call for companies to have verification of the identities of those posting job listings.Beijing has been following up its new regulation with audits, according to the person, who asked not to be named because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.But in recent months, Beijing has ratcheted up its already strict internet controls, and such an approach to managing the web takes its toll on companies.After being forced to borrow hundreds of dollars from family and friends, Mr. Li drowned himself in a small pond along a highway on the outskirts of Tianjin, a port city near Beijing.His death was one of several since the summer, which has spurred an uproar across the country and prompted a government-led crackdown on pyramid schemes.The company has struggled to become a major player there. In part, that is because of China\u2019s unique internet culture. While hiring sites are popular, many people opt to manage their professional contacts in the country\u2019s most popular social network, WeChat.Advertisement"}

She was formerly an executive at Facebook, which her brother, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founded.Ms. Zuckerberg said that she and her colleague both reported the man\u2019s behavior to the flight attendants, who, she added, shrugged off their complaints, saying that he was a frequent flier who was known to act that way.During the three-hour flight, the man was given multiple alcoholic drinks, she said, and continued to harass her the entire time. At one point, Ms. Zuckerberg said, a flight attendant stopped by the man\u2019s seat and said with a laugh, \u201cAre you behaving today?\u201dShe said a flight attendant offered to move her to another seat in the back of the plane, but she declined. \u201cWhy is it the woman that needs to switch seats in this situation? Shouldn\u2019t he have been thrown off the plane?!\u201d she said.\u201cWe cannot support businesses that are complicit in allowing this behavior, and value the money of harassers over the comfort of their passengers,\u201d she added.A spokesman for Alaska Airlines said on Thursday that it was \u201cfully investigating\u201d the encounter and that two airline executives had talked to Ms. Zuckerberg about her flight. The passenger\u2019s travel privileges have also been suspended, the airline said.\u201cWhat Randi Zuckerberg shared with us is very disturbing,\u201d the spokesman, Ray Lane, said. \u201cWe want our guests to feel safe. As a company, we have zero tolerance for any type of sexual misconduct that creates an unsafe environment for our guests and crew members.\u201dMs. Zuckerberg updated her Facebook post after she talked to the Alaska Airlines executives. \u201cWhile it never should have happened in the first place, I am thankful that they are taking the situation seriously,\u201d she said. She did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.The actual number of assaults was likely far greater, as the majority go unreported.Andrew J. Maloney, a lawyer who specializes in aviation law, said that based on Ms. Zuckerberg\u2019s account of the episode, Alaska Airlines could be held liable in a lawsuit. He said it appeared the airline failed to protect her from the unruly passenger.\u201cPassengers have a right to feel secure, and airlines have a legal duty to protect passengers from harassment, especially if they are aware that a passenger is being harassed,\u201d Mr. Maloney said. \u201cOnce Ms. Zuckerberg told flight attendants about this man\u2019s behavior, they should have moved him to a different seat or ejected him from the airplane.\u201dShivani Vora contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

From Washington to Maine, New Jersey to North Carolina, Trumpist ugliness was met and vanquished, sometimes by the very targets of right-wing scorn.In January, a local New Jersey Republican politician, John Carman, mocked the anti-Trump Women\u2019s March by asking on Facebook whether the protest would be \u201cover in time for them to cook dinner.\u201d That so upset Ashley Bennett, a 32-year-old health care worker, that she challenged Mr. Carman for his seat on the Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders. \u201cElected officials shouldn\u2019t be on social media mocking and belittling people who are expressing their concerns about their community and the nation,\u201d she said during her campaign. If Mr. Carman does it again, it will be as a private citizen. Ms. Bennett defeated him on Tuesday.Democratic victories were not just a matter of diversity overcoming division, though. Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor, Ralph Northam, beat an ugly campaign of Trumpian immigrant bashing and Confederate nostalgia run by his Republican opponent, Ed Gillespie. Yet he also had, in the end, a progressive economic program, as did Phil Murphy, the victorious Democratic gubernatorial candidate in New Jersey.Mr. Northam and down-ticket candidates energized voters on issues big and small \u2014 and knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors to translate outrage into votes.What welcome inclusiveness at a time when the president stews in a hate-filled bubble, appealing only to the shrinking fraction of Americans unrepulsed by his behavior.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ajit Pai: Media Ownership Rules Must Adjust to the Digital Era", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDo you check your Twitter feed to get the latest news? Monitor trending topics on your Facebook page to see what\u2019s making headlines? Set news alerts on Google News? Read blogs analyzing the latest at the White House? Watch breaking news on cable networks or YouTube channels?No doubt most of you do some or all of these things. But none of these information sources exist in the regulatory world of the Federal Communications Commission, where core media ownership rules presume the marketplace for news is defined entirely by pulp, rabbit ears and transistor radios. In this archaic world, Americans get their news only from newspapers and broadcast television and radio stations, and the internet doesn\u2019t exist.For over four decades, the F.C.C. has restricted the ability of broadcast media outlets to also own newspapers, and vice versa, in the same market, under what is known as the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule.This rule was established in 1975 with the stated purpose of preserving and promoting a diversity of viewpoints. Arguably, it made sense at the time. But with the internet now dominating the news landscape, the rule is no longer needed, and may actually be undermining the diversity of viewpoints it was intended to foster.For newspapers to continue to play an important role in civic engagement, they need more access to capital. Their decline has created a real threat to independent reporting at the state and local level. A broadcaster\u2019s investment in a newspaper could go a long way toward keeping citizens informed. (Indeed, the number of TV and radio stations has doubled over the past half-century, even as newspapers have been vanishing.)Critics of this proposal have expressed concern that eliminating the rule will lead to additional media consolidation. I understand that point of view and recognize that some limits are needed. That\u2019s why, for example, F.C.C. rules will continue to prohibit any company from owning more than two television stations in any market.But as with any issue, it is important to go beyond the slogans and look at the specifics. And whether we look at the history of grandfathered newspaper-broadcast combinations in bigger cities like Chicago or smaller ones like Scranton, Pa., experience does not show that the residents in those communities have been harmed or their news marketplaces have been monopolized. Rather, we generally see news outlets that have been able to better serve the public.Advertisement"}

By last August, there were more than 70,000 results. An hourlong polemic by Mr. Awlaki demonizing the United States titled \u201cBattle of the Hearts and Minds\u201d had more than 80,000 views and 700 likes.The removal of this online content will ultimately save lives. There are at least 90 instances in which extremists in the United States and Europe were shown to have had ties to or been influenced by Mr. Awlaki, including the Fort Hood gunman, Nidal Hassan; the \u201cunderwear bomber,\u201d Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab; the Charlie Hebdo attackers Sa\u00efd and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi; Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in Orlando, Fla.; and the Boston Marathon bombers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev.YouTube\u2019s recent action was a significant step in a new direction, but now more must be done. Mr. Awlaki\u2019s content should be removed from all other Google sites, including the file-sharing platform Google Drive. Other internet companies, large and small, should look to YouTube\u2019s example and follow suit.Recently, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube established the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism to share information and best practices about how to counter the threat of terrorist content online. A zero-tolerance policy regarding Mr. Awlaki and similar figures would be a model for other companies.In that same vein, industrywide standards are needed to ensure the timely and permanent removal of dangerous content, especially when produced by groups and individuals on the State Department\u2019s Foreign Terrorist Organizations list, the Treasury Department\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list, and the United Nations Security Council Sanctions list, and individuals with demonstrable links to violence.There is no shortage of extremists online \u2014 Turki al-Binali, Abdullah Faisal, Yusuf al-Qaradawi and Ahmad Musa Jibril are notable examples. They must be subject to the same treatment and their content should be swiftly and permanently removed.YouTube\u2019s acknowledgment of the harmful impact of the Awlaki sermons should also open the door to a broader and more consistent approach against the content posted by the Islamic State online.The group\u2019s sophisticated exploitation of the internet to spread its message must be matched by a systematic and resource-intensive effort that includes website hosting companies such as WordPress, encrypted communications platforms such as Telegram and file-sharing platforms such as JustPaste.it, apart from video platforms such as YouTube.Killing terrorists is only half the battle, as the case of Mr. Awlaki has clearly shown. A new focus on combating extremist and terrorist ideologies online, through company policies, industrywide standards and technology, will be paramount in keeping the public safe.Mark Wallace, the chief executive of the Counter Extremism Project, was an ambassador to the United Nations in the George W.

With his speeches and flamboyant dressing down of technology companies, he became an emblem of China\u2019s increasingly unapologetic internet controls.The next year, Mr. Lu denied that China engaged in internet censorship.To quell what was perceived as a freewheeling social media, Mr. Lu went after some of the country\u2019s biggest internet personalities. At private dinners he threatened them, and on national television he scolded them. He also limited the functions and purged many of their accounts.Yet his high profile was also a liability.In China, government officials are generally dull and predictable, and Mr. Lu stood out, and often raised eyebrows. Even as his star was rising, rumors swirled about his possible fall from grace. At the World Internet Conference he helped create, he could be seen smoking cigars with a Cuban telecom official and power-walking in sweats for exercise in the morning.The announcement of the investigation could help clear the air ahead of the World Internet Conference, scheduled for two weeks from now in Wuzhen, a canal town in eastern China. Presented as a sort of Davos of the internet, the meeting was conceived as a way to show off China\u2019s new influence over the technology industry.Analysts said that despite the public strutting of Mr. Lu, he had difficulty turning the Cyberspace Administration into a powerful regulator. Created in 2014, the agency was tasked with managing an internet and technology sector already overseen by several ministries as well as China\u2019s security organizations and the military.Mr. Lu will be succeeded by Xu Lin, who worked directly under Mr. Xi when he was briefly party secretary of Shanghai in 2007.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Internet Is Dying. Repealing Net Neutrality Hastens That Death.", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe internet is dying.Sure, technically, the internet still works. Pull up Facebook on your phone and you will still see your second cousin\u2019s baby pictures. But that isn\u2019t really the internet. It\u2019s not the open, anyone-can-build-it network of the 1990s and early 2000s, the product of technologies created over decades through government funding and academic research, the network that helped undo Microsoft\u2019s stranglehold on the tech business and gave us upstarts like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix.Because net neutrality shelters start-ups \u2014 which can\u2019t easily pay for fast-line access \u2014 from internet giants that can pay, the rules are just about the last bulwark against the complete corporate takeover of much of online life. When the rules go, the internet will still work, but it will look like and feel like something else altogether \u2014 a network in which business development deals, rather than innovation, determine what you experience, a network that feels much more like cable TV than the technological Wild West that gave you Napster and Netflix.The five most valuable American companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 control much of the online infrastructure, from app stores to operating systems to cloud storage to nearly all of the online ad business. A handful of broadband companies \u2014 AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon, many of which are also aiming to become content companies, because why not \u2014 provide virtually all the internet connections to American homes and smartphones.Together these giants have carved the internet into a historically profitable system of fiefs. They have turned a network whose very promise was endless innovation into one stuck in mud, where every start-up is at the tender mercy of some of the largest corporations on the planet.The internet\u2019s singular power, in its early gold-rush days, was its flexibility. People could imagine a dazzling array of new uses for the network, and as quick as that, they could build and deploy them \u2014 a site that sold you books, a site that cataloged the world\u2019s information, an application that let you \u201cborrow\u201d other people\u2019s music, a social network that could connect you to anyone.You didn\u2019t need permission for any of this stuff; some of these innovations ruined traditional industries, some fundamentally altered society, and many were legally dubious. But the internet meant you could just put it up, and if it worked, the rest of the world would quickly adopt it.But if flexibility was the early internet\u2019s promise, it was soon imperiled. In 2003, Tim Wu, a law professor now at Columbia Law School (he\u2019s also a contributor to The New York Times), saw signs of impending corporate control over the growing internet. Broadband companies that were investing great sums to roll out faster and faster internet service to Americans were becoming wary of running an anything-goes network.Though it has been through a barrage of legal challenges and resurrections, some form of net neutrality has been the governing regime on the internet since 2005. The new F.C.C. order would undo the idea completely; companies would be allowed to block or demand payment for certain traffic as they liked, as long as they disclosed the arrangements.At the moment, broadband companies are promising not to act unfairly, and they argue that undoing the rules would give them further incentive to invest in their broadband capacity, ultimately improving the internet.Brian Hart, an F.C.C. spokesman, said broadband companies would still be covered by antitrust laws and other rules meant to prevent anticompetitive behavior. He noted that Mr. Pai\u2019s proposals would simply return the network to an earlier, pre-network-neutrality regulatory era.\u201cThe internet flourished under this framework before, and it will again,\u201d he said.Broadband companies are taking a similar line. When I pointed out to a Comcast spokeswoman that the company\u2019s promises were only voluntary \u2014 that nothing will prevent Comcast from one day creating special tiers of internet service with bundled content, much like the way it now sells cable TV \u2014 she suggested I was jumping the gun.Well, O.K. But a vibrant network doesn\u2019t die all at once. It takes time and neglect; it grows weaker by the day, but imperceptibly, so that one day we are living in a digital world controlled by giants and we come to regard the whole thing as normal.It\u2019s not normal. It wasn\u2019t always this way. The internet doesn\u2019t have to be a corporate playground. That\u2019s just the path we\u2019ve chosen.Advertisement"}

As of about midnight local time they were still working, Whale Stranding Indonesia told The New York Times via a Facebook message.Earlier in the day, the rescuers successfully relocated five of the whales to deeper water, Nur Mahdi, the head of the Aceh Province marine and fisheries office in Sumatra, told The Associated Press. They are also treating two injured whales and attempting to refloat the others, he said.\u201cThe team seems to be determined to work during night time to release the remaining whales,\u201d Whale Stranding Indonesia reported.Two more whales were released just before sunrise, the group said, according to an official from the Center for Coastal and Marine Resources Management, the regional marine and fisheries authority in Indonesia.Time was of the essence in this situation, in part because whales that come near land are at risk of suffocation and organ failure.\u201cIf you\u2019re 60,000 pounds and your body is meant to float around then gravity can take its toll,\u201d said Regina Asmutis-Silvia, the director of the North American office of Whale and Dolphins Conservation, a nonprofit that has assisted with whale strandings in the United States.In addition, the shock of being stranded evokes a stress response.\u201cElevated levels of adrenaline also take toll on the organs,\u201d Ms. Asmutis-Silvia said. It\u2019s similar to that of a human that has been in a car accident, she added.There are multiple reasons these events can happen, Ms. Asmutis-Silvia said, including navigational error, changes in the environment, a wayward hunt for food or tidal changes.Sperm whales tend to travel as a group and are unlikely to abandon their podmates.\u201cWhen they\u2019re in tight social groups they\u2019re in this together,\u201d Ms. Asmutis-Silvia said.Whales are especially important to the ecosystem, she said, because their waste fertilizes phytoplankton, the plants that produce half the world\u2019s oxygen.Advertisement"}

His final duty title was \u201cprisoner.\u201dHis first wife, Tessa Kelley, divorced him while he was confined and was awarded the couple\u2019s only four household items of value: a television, an Xbox, a wedding ring and a revolver.After his confinement, Mr. Kelley was forced out of the military with a bad conduct discharge. The Air Force said the conviction should have barred Mr. Kelley from owning any guns. Instead, law enforcement officials say, he bought several.Friends from New Braunfels, Tex., where he went to high school, expressed shock in the aftermath of the shooting, remembering how Mr. Kelley was a friendly, if awkward, teenager who grew up active in his church. His senior yearbook photo shows him smiling, with untamed hair and a Hollister T-shirt. But in recent years, friends said, he grew so dark that many unfriended him on Facebook.\u201cI had always known there was something off about him. But he wasn\u2019t always a \u2018psychopath,\u2019\u201d a longtime friend, Courtney Kleiber, posted on Facebook on Sunday. \u201cWe had a lot of good times together. Over the years we all saw him change into something that he wasn\u2019t. To be completely honest, I\u2019m really not surprised this happened, and I don\u2019t think anyone who knew him is very surprised either.\u201dInstead of straightening out after his bad conduct discharge, Mr. Kelley began a long downward slide that culminated in the shooting Sunday.After getting out of confinement, Mr. Kelley moved into a barn at his parents\u2019 house, which they had converted into an apartment, according to the local sheriff\u2019s office records.During the next two years, he was investigated twice for abusing women. The authorities in Comal County, which includes Mr. Kelley\u2019s hometown New Braunfels, released records on Monday that showed he had been the subject of an investigation for sexual assault and rape in 2013.The investigation ended without the filing of any charges \u2014 Mr. Kelley\u2019s only skirmishes in the local courts were traffic violations.Less than a year after the sexual assault report, deputies were summoned again after Mr. Kelley\u2019s girlfriend at the time, Danielle Shields, reportedly sent a text message to a friend saying she was being abused. Deputies who responded told a dispatcher, according to the report, that it was a \u201cmisunderstanding and teenage drama.\u201d Mr. Kelley married Ms. Shields two months later, local records show.At the time of both episodes, Mr. Kelley\u2019s appeals were still pending before military courts.Mr. Kelley was finally discharged from the Air Force in 2014. He married Ms. Shields in April that year. Law enforcement officials described their relationship this week as \u201cestranged.\u201dA few months after the wedding, the couple moved to Colorado Springs, where voter registration documents list his address as Parking Space 60 at a collection of trailers in a gravel lot called the Fountain Creek RV Park.A woman living in a camper next door, who gave her name only as Susan, said a man of similar age and description lived in Spot 60 for a few months during that time.\u201cHe was kind of off,\u201d she said as she loaded blankets into one of the RV park\u2019s washing machines.He said hello a few times in passing but was never friendly and stayed only a few months, she said. She never heard any arguments from his trailer.\u201cThe only thing that sticks out about him was his dog,\u201d she said.He had a puppy that he kept tied up in the sun all day outside his RV without water, she said. She also recalled an episode in which the police were called because he had struck the dog repeatedly in the head.Records show Mr. Kelley was charged with cruelty to animals, a misdemeanor, in August 2014, pleaded guilty and was given a deferred sentence. He moved out a few weeks later, she said.While in Colorado and Texas, Mr. Kelley purchased a number of guns at gun stores, according to law enforcement officials. On Monday, the Air Force admitted that it had failed to enter information from Mr. Kelley\u2019s domestic violence court-martial into a federal database that could have blocked him from buying the weapon used in the church attack.Mr. Kelley, whose father, Michael Kelley, is a computer programmer and accountant, enlisted in the Air Force soon after graduating from New Braunfels High School in 2009. Devin Kelley served as a low-ranking airman in a logistics readiness unit. A LinkedIn account in his name says he worked in cargo and distribution before his court-martial.The account says that after the military, Mr. Kelley briefly worked as an aide at a youth Bible school in Kingsville, Tex., \u201chelping their minds grow and prosper.\u201dFriends said on Facebook that in recent years, Mr. Kelley had become vocally anti-Christian, to the point where many stopped communicating with him. His Facebook page, which has been deleted, listed that he liked a number of atheist groups.\u201cHe was always talking about how people who believe in God were stupid and trying to preach his atheism,\u201d one of his Facebook friends, Nina Rosa Nava, posted on the site, saying she unfriended him because of it.Law enforcement stopped short of saying religious views may have influenced Mr. Kelley, saying Monday that the shooting may have been motivated by a \u201cdomestic situation\u201d involving Mr. Kelley\u2019s estranged wife and her family.Mr. Kelley never held jobs for long after the military. In June of this year, Mr. Kelley was hired as an unarmed night security guard at Schlitterbahn, a vast water park in New Braunfels. Less than six weeks later he was \u201cterminated,\u201d a spokeswoman for the park, Winter D. Prosapio, said Monday, adding, \u201cHe was not a good fit.\u201dBy 2017, he had returned to a house in New Braunfels that records show was owned by his parents. The house was about an hour from the church where the shooting occurred. According to local law enforcement, Mr. Kelley\u2019s second wife at times attended the church with members of her extended family.The cover photo on Mr. Kelley\u2019s Facebook page appears to show a Ruger 8515 rifle, equipped with additional aftermarket products, including a red-dot aiming sight for faster targeting and a two-stage trigger for greater accuracy.Such rifles have been legal for civilians to own in most of the United States since the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, and have become popular among many firearms owners.Mr. Kelley seemed enamored with the weapon. He posted a photograph of it on Oct. 29 with the caption \u201cShe\u2019s a bad bitch.\u201dLaw enforcement officials guarded the cactus- and rock-dotted Kelley property in New Braunfels on Monday morning, when the top of the house was just barely visible atop the tree line. A wire fence ran along the roadway.Signs on a cattle gate at the entrance read \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d and \u201cBeware of Dog.\u201dSome neighbors said they sometimes heard gunfire from the property. But in this stretch of the Texas hill country, that is hardly cause for alarm.One neighbor, who would give his name only as Doug, said he heard shots fired at the Kelley property that would set his dogs barking.\u201cMy dogs, they would be outside, and we would hear, \u2018Bim-bam, bim-bam, bim-bam, bim-bam,\u2019\u201d he said.Alan Blinder reported from New Braunfels, Tex., Dave Philipps from Colorado Springs and Richard A.

{"Headline": "The Four Rules of Thanksgiving Wines", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesHuman behavior is often unpredictable. But immutable rules seem to govern certain situations, like Thanksgiving entertaining.Rule No. 1: You will be anxious before the holiday. This is inescapable. You will worry that you have not sufficiently disguised the conditions under which you ordinarily live, which is what cleaning house usually achieves.You will be concerned that you do not have enough food, while at the same time fearing that you have too much, and that the turkey will be ready too soon, or too late, or never.You will dread underlying tensions among family members and overbearing behavior.I have not even mentioned the wine.Rule No. 2: The holiday always goes beautifully.This is the saving grace, invariably forgotten. If kept in mind, it can easily make these jittery few days far more bearable.For most families, Thanksgiving this year will not be unlike Thanksgiving any other year. Whatever new elements arrive in 2017, the foreboding is the same as always.Nonetheless, the projected disasters almost never occur. Everybody has a great time. Remembering this will not help to achieve preliminary serenity, but understanding the process can make the angst easier to endure.In order to help, the Thanksgiving wine panel annually tries to eliminate wine selections from your areas of concern. Each year, we share a Thanksgiving feast in advance. We each bring two bottles of wine to the meal, each costing no more than $25, with the aim of adding to our understanding of which types of wines work best.As with many families, we welcomed a new member this year. Our colleague Tejal Rao \u2014 sitting in for Julia Moskin, who was away on assignment \u2014 joined me, Florence Fabricant, Pete Wells and our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch.Over the years, we have learned and affirmed that wine is the least consequential issue anybody will face at Thanksgiving. Why is that?Rule No. 3: If the food is good and the company convivial, you cannot go wrong with the wine. If the food is bad and the company annoying, wine can only help.What\u2019s the worst that can happen with wine? Only one potential disaster looms: running out.The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand. We generally recommend one bottle per wine-drinking adult. This may seem like a lot, but it is simply a hedge against an insufficient supply. You do not have to finish it all. If you like, you can even give away unopened bottles with the leftovers.Beyond quantity, you need to provide both reds and whites. You can add ros\u00e9 or a sparkling wine, but both red and white are essential. You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn. This is not the time to debate these issues. Let guests drink what they want unfettered.In our calculus, we imagine Thanksgiving as a large, freewheeling buffet meal, with lots of different dishes and a sprawling patchwork of flavors. It\u2019s not the time to fret about pairing particular dishes with certain bottles. The trick is to provide versatile, nimble wines that pair well with many foods and will not be as fatiguing as everything else.That generally means bottles not especially high in alcohol, generally below 14 percent. They should not be tannic or oaky, but they must be energetic with lively acidity, which helps to refresh and cleanse the palate.Over the course of many years we have identified wines that almost always work well: Beaujolais and bone-dry sauvignon blancs are crowd-pleasers. Basic Italian reds made of barbera or sangiovese are fine, as are Italian whites made of fiano or carricante. Loire reds, pinot noirs, chardonnays, chenin blancs, menc\u00edas from Spain, rieslings \u2014 all are fine choices.These wines, I should say, fit our particular vision of the feast. If you are having a small dinner party for six with multiple courses and you would like to serve precious bottles poured into exquisite glasses, by all means do.For our party, we assume a crowd who might be drinking from tumblers or even paper cups. These are fine for big parties. But I do recommend steering clear of plastic goblets, which have a nasty habit of separating bowl from stem at the worst possible moments for your clothing, carpeting and anxiety threshold.Almost all the wines the panel sampled were excellent, and the few that fell short were nonetheless fine. Tejal brought the two most fascinating wines, both white, sort of.The first, the 2016 Caprice du Chameau from La Vrille et Le Papillon, a brother-and-sister team who make natural wines in the Ard\u00e8che region of southeastern France, was unfiltered, giving the wine a hazy appearance. Yet it was sublimely light and spicy, vibrant and thoroughly delicious. Surprisingly, it was made of viognier, which I usually associate with heavier, fruitier wines. Though visually unusual, the wine was ideal, with what Pete called \u201ca feeling of over the river and through the woods.\u201dThe gritty, amber-colored result was savory, intense and unusual, and perhaps better for a crowd of questing wine fanatics than a general-interest holiday group. I would happily serve it with cheese, though not for the long haul of a feast.Bernie took an unusual tack in selecting his white. He chose a Quincy, a Loire sauvignon blanc, because, he said, he remembered a meal many years ago when a Quincy was universally reviled.Collectively, most of these wines added good options to the tried-and-true selections. Tejal, however, second-guessed her choice of the Spanish chasselas. \u201cI realized that maybe something I personally liked is not for everybody,\u201d she said.She\u2019s correct only to the extent of the distance that a wine lies from the mainstream.

{"Headline": "Improving Your \u2018News Diet\u2019: A Three-Step Lesson Plan for Teenagers and Teachers", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by_________What a year the last few days have been, huh?This is news in the era of President Trump. It slaps you awake, follows you around all day, intrudes on your conversations, interrupts your dinner, whispers as you try to sleep.That was six months ago, and the pace this fall has been even more relentless: Political news vied for the front page with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the earthquake in Mexico, nuclear threats from North Korea, the Las Vegas shootings, the attack in Manhattan and more. Add to that the problem of \u201cfake news,\u201d and we certainly understand why anyone might simply want to ignore current events entirely.But in a connected world, information comes at us constantly, whether we choose it or not, and we must each figure out a way to navigate it. Not for a school assignment, but for our real lives.The challenge has three steps:1. Do a personal \u201cnews audit\u201d to observe the role of news in their lives right now.2. Experiment with their \u201cnews diets\u201d in some way to find new sources that address any lacks they found.3. Write a short essay or produce a short video that reflects on the process and what they learned. What did they discover about their news habits before and after they did the challenge \u2014 and what can they say about the role of news in their lives in general?To help teenagers and their teachers approach each of these steps, we have created a kind of lesson plan below. Each section is written directly to students, but each also ends with tips for teachers who may be doing this as a class project.Questions? Let us know in the comments, and thank you for participating._________Be honest with yourself: What does news mean to you? You may not remember a time when the news wasn\u2019t available online, but because it is, a lot of what informs us isn\u2019t necessarily coming from traditional news organizations. News can come from many places \u2014 and sometimes it feels like it\u2019s coming from everywhere all at once.So...is it headlines in a newspaper like The Times or breaking news on CNN? Is it links friends or relatives post in your social feeds, or discussions during lunch or at your dinner table? Is it what you view on Snapchat? What you watch on YouTube? Links your mom shares with you? Threads you follow on Reddit or accounts on Tumblr? Texts from your friends about what people in your school are doing? All of the above?Now think about how news has played a role in your life up until now. Alone or in conversation with others, see if you can come up with an example for each of these...\u2022 A memory from your childhood of hearing important breaking news, and its effect on you and those around you.\u2022 A recent breaking news item that got your attention.\u2022 A time when you were embarrassed not to know about something in the news.\u2022 A time when you used news of some kind to help you in a practical way.\u2022 A time when you felt a personal connection to news about a person, place, event or issue.\u2022 A time you\u2019ve shared a news item, whether via word of mouth, a social feed, email or in any other way.\u2022 A time when news overwhelmed, angered or upset you.\u2022 A time when knowledge of something in the news provided you with \u201csocial currency.\u201d That is, your friends, family or community was interested in it, and knowing about it enriched your relationships or helped you build new ones.Finally, answer the question, \u201cWhy do I want to consume news?\u201d Again, be as honest with yourself as you can. For instance, you might answer:\u2022 I want to be up-to-date on news about a place, group of people, issue or aspect of culture that I care about or am personally connected to.\u2022 I don\u2019t want seem like I don\u2019t know what is going on in the world because it\u2019s embarrassing.\u2022 I want to find \u201cnews I can use\u201d on a specific topic or issue.\u2022 I want to be entertained.\u2022 I feel like following news will help me academically \u2014 or in a future job.I grew increasingly bothered by how up and down the news would make me feel. At times I\u2019d be inspired by a part of the world I would never otherwise have access to. At other times, I felt completely lost following a story I just didn\u2019t have the time or context needed to really get. And at others, I felt numb, in a sort of haze of \u201cI know a little bit about a lot of unpleasant things and have no agency to do anything about them.\u201dStudents could then share some of their answers in small groups and, later define \u201cnews\u201d as a class. Together everyone might come up with a list of reasons people might follow news \u2014 and why they might not.Once you\u2019ve defined for yourself what news means to you and why you want to follow it (or why you\u2019re avoiding it), take 24 to 48 hours to closely observe the information that comes to you right now, and where it comes from.To do this, you might keep a chart of some kind, creating as many columns as you like depending on what you want to observe.But we recommend adding two other columns so that you can better use this chart as a reflective tool. First, a column in which you rate or comment on how reliable you think the information is and why, and second, a column for open-ended comments that you can use to jot down emotional reactions, questions, patterns you notice, or anything else that seems important.Would you like some examples?Now that you\u2019ve spent 24-to 48 hours noticing what news you already follow, think about what would make it better for you. What would you like to add, subtract or change? Why? How can you come up with a mix that will improve your life?Think about things like discovery, time, location, and what you\u2019ll do with the news after you consume it. For example, maybe your biggest problem is that you just don\u2019t know how to find great journalism that you actually care about it because it doesn\u2019t show up in your apps or feeds. Or, maybe you regularly discover interesting things but simply don\u2019t have the time to enjoy it \u2014 because who actually has 45 minutes to read a 5,000-word story on a Tuesday? Or, you may just prefer to read a book or watch a movie when you have free time because they give you that satisfying, relaxing feeling of having a clear beginning, middle and end. In that case, is there a news outlet out there that can give you a neat beginning, middle and end to catch up?Here are some steps you can take. Together they may take you a week or more since you may have to repeat them until the mix feels right.What is missing from my list? What do I have too much of, and what might I not have enough of? What new topics do I want to learn more about? What new sources could I explore? How reliable is the news I\u2019m getting now? How balanced? How representative of a variety of points of view and experiences? How useful for my everyday life?Where should I get my news?Perhaps the best answer, for now, is that you should try to get your news from a variety of sources. Variety here means variety in the media forms you choose and variety in the types of messages you choose. In other words, If you tend to get all of your news from cable television, you might supplement that by adding some newspaper time into the mix, or maybe spend a little bit of time listening to a public radio station to find out what they\u2019re reporting. Likewise, if you tend to get all of your news from one newspaper, you might consider turning on a cable TV news channel occasionally to see how they are presenting some of the stories you\u2019ve been following in print. If the internet is your sole source of news, consider comparing what you read at the websites of major news organizations, with you might read at some blog sites, or on social networking sites like Facebook, or video sites such as YouTube.It\u2019s always good to vary the perspective of your news sources as well. A big part of news literacy is understanding that there really is no such thing as an objective point of view in news, and that all news sources, because of technologies and because of personal, organizational and economic considerations, have their own way of shaping news.So look at the mix of sources in your news audit and experiment with adding new ones that address any imbalances you notice.\u2022 Or, maybe you\u2019ve decided that you\u2019d like to get a global view via more international news \u2014 or, conversely, maybe you\u2019d like to focus more locally, on your own city, town or even neighborhood.\u2022 Is there a topic you\u2019d like to follow in depth \u2014 say, coverage of a particular community, issue or trend? If so, seek out and add sources that will tell you more about that, or compare the ways different sources handle it.\u2022 Or, you might just want to add more \u201cnews you can use\u201d to improve your life \u2014 whether health and nutrition information, news about college, careers or hobbies, or anything else.Assess your list to see if it helps you achieve the goals you set out to achieve. For example, if you want to understand exactly what is happening in Russia and why that country\u2019s relationship with the United States is so complicated, why is over 50% of your news consumption about baseball? Or, if you want to understand someone whose politics are different than yours, are you reading any news sources that they follow to understand their worldview? Do you know anything about the communities where those voters live and how they might be different from your own?You could also invite a range of people from around the school or community to come to class and share their own daily news habits and sources, and encourage students on their own to interview people they respect to find even more. Together, you might create a long list of options in a Google doc which everyone can edit.First, live with your new news diet for a week or so, and notice what happens. Next, reflect on the change.But even if you aren\u2019t doing this for our challenge, thinking about this exercise and what you discovered can help you figure out a healthy way to navigate the stream of news in your life.Here are a few questions to help:\u2022 Where did you start? What did your news audit reveal about your habits and sources and the role of news in your life at the beginning of exercise?\u2022 What happened when you experimented with your news diet? How did it impact your daily life? What stood out from the experience?\u2022 Will you continue to experiment with your news diet? What may be the right mix for you? Why?\u2022 What notable reactions to individual news items or topics did you have along the way?\u2022 What does this exercise leave you noticing, wondering or thinking about the role of news in your life in general? Is the right mix of news making your life better somehow?\u2022 Do you want to do anything with the news you consumed? Share it in an email or on a social feed? Write about it yourself somehow? Get involved in an issue? What could you do?\u2022 What was most notable, useful or interesting about this experience?Then, they might work in groups to share their answers. Please note that we allow submissions from individuals, or from groups of up to five. While writing personal essays might be tricky in a group, group video-making may be a fun way to approach the project. How can they bring their insights together into one piece? How can they show visually what they learned? You might allow students to choose whether they\u2019d like to work alone or in groups, and whether an essay or a video feels more natural.But as we say in the contest rules, we hope students also know that they are allowed to have a sense of humor about the project, and take creative risks of all kinds. We\u2019ve never done a challenge like this before, and we can\u2019t wait to be surprised.Thank you for participating!On Variety in News Sources and Reading News TodayOn Reliability of News Sources_________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For This Playwright, Africa With Laughter, Not Tears", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA year ago, the actress and playwright Jocelyn Bioh decided to write a play about African characters \u2014 a searing play, a brutal play, a play that theaters would finally produce. \u201cI was going to write the \u2018poverty porn,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThe play about African suffering.\u201dShe ended up with \u201cHappiness and Joe.\u201d It\u2019s a rom-com.Ms. Bioh, a native New Yorker whose parents emigrated from Ghana in 1968, has made it her mission, theatrically and personally, to tell stories about African and African-American characters that buck expectation and defy stereotype.\u201cI thought I was being so deep and it was so stupid,\u201d she said.The play\u2019s director, Niegel Smith, watched her work with the sound designer to encapsulate 450 years of black female representation in one dance. \u201cJocelyn is go for broke, no stone unturned,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote in an email. \u201cShe\u2019s not an artist to be messed with.\u201dMr. Jacobs-Jenkins went on to write the part of the slave Minnie in \u201cAn Octoroon\u201d specifically for her. Ms. Bioh\u2019s clever, jaunty performance landed every provocative line. (\u201cI know we slaves and evurthang, but you are not your job,\u201d Minnie says as she sweeps.)\u201cSo much of comedy is based on patter, on breath, on lifting the joke out of the text,\u201d Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins said in a recent phone interview. \u201cShe\u2019s just a heat-seeking missile in that way. I don\u2019t ever want to let her go.\u201dIn 2014, Ms. Bioh appeared on Broadway in the ensemble of \u201cCurious Incident,\u201d playing a punk girl and an unhelpful transit employee. It was the first time in her life she\u2019d made a decent salary. But she missed playwriting. So she left the show after a year to concentrate on her scripts.By then Ms. Bioh had realized that her voice was a comic one. \u201cI\u2019ve always moved through the world comedically,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say I\u2019m happy, you know, Disney Channel kind of happy, every time. But I always find humor in everything.\u201dThis emphasis on comedy set her apart from her peers, but it didn\u2019t always sit well with producers. Ms. Bioh recalls a conversation around her play \u201cNollywood Dreams,\u201d about a woman cheerfully seduced by Nigeria\u2019s burgeoning film industry. A literary manager liked the play, Ms. Bioh said, but couldn\u2019t understand why all the characters were so happy. Hadn\u2019t she read about Boko Haram?Ms. Bioh had. But those weren\u2019t the stories she wanted to tell. She wanted to write about people like her Ghanaian relatives. \u201cThey\u2019re funny and wild and silly,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re everyday people who are just trying to pursue extraordinary lives.\u201dThe theater decided to produce \u201cSchool Girls,\u201d Ms. Chase said, because it explored \u201cthe impact that beauty standards have on young women in a way that is incredibly funny and urgent.\u201d Once MCC had signed on, Ms. Bioh spent the fall furiously rewriting the play even while appearing in \u201cIn the Blood.\u201d (On her Facebook feed, there are pictures of her in costume, typing away.)As Rebecca Taichman, the play\u2019s director (and a Tony Award winner earlier this year for \u201cIndecent\u201d), noted, the play \u201csmashes up this real comic point of view with profound sadness and anger. But it\u2019s lifted through this comic impulse. Always.\u201dMs. Bioh does not appear in \u201cSchool Girls,\u201d but even offstage, her love for her characters \u2014 even the dumb ones, even the mean ones \u2014 is palpable. During a recent rehearsal she suddenly made a change in the script, putting an unpopular girl on the soccer team. She seemed to think it might cheer the character up. (In \u201cHappiness and Joe,\u201d her newest play, a character is trying to keep up with the Kardashians, even in the middle of a what might be a genocide.)As a first-generation American, Ms. Bioh said that she feels \u201can incredible responsibility in getting people to understand and empathize and sympathize with all of the characters.\u201dWill her mean-girl mother sympathize? Well, she retired to Ghana, so Ms. Bioh isn\u2019t sure she\u2019ll be in town for the play. But if the play is a success, will it at least help to banish Ms. Bioh\u2019s bad kid reputation? \u201cNo,\u201d said Ms. Bioh. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever forgive me for not being a doctor.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Salvatore Riina, Italian Mafia\u2019s \u2018Boss of Bosses,\u2019 Dies at 87", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Salvatore Riina, the Mafia\u2019s murderous \u201cboss of bosses,\u201d who earned multiple life sentences and the nickname the Beast for his cruelty and for unleashing a war against law enforcement that claimed the lives of Italian prosecutors and police officers, died early Friday in a hospital in the northern Italian city of Parma. He was 87.The Ministry of Justice announced his death. He had recently undergone surgery and been placed in a medically induced coma.As the head of Sicily\u2019s infamous Cosa Nostra crime syndicate since the 1970s, Mr. Riina, known as Tot\u00f2, had a long criminal reach that spilled blood across Italy and extended a black hand of extortion and trafficking across the globe.He retaliated against the Italian government\u2019s campaign to crush the Mafia by striking back hard, ordering in 1992 the bombing assassinations of two leading anti-Mafia magistrates, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. He also orchestrated the kidnapping, strangling and dissolving in acid of the young son of a mob informer.In 1993, the Italian authorities captured Mr. Riina in Sicily\u2019s capital, Palermo, and judges ultimately gave him 26 life sentences. He spent a good deal of the next quarter-century in isolation, with little time outside his cell in Milan.The Italian justice minister, Andrea Orlando, allowed family members to visit Mr. Riina in the hospital on Thursday, his birthday. He had four children, one of whom, Salvo, wrote on Facebook, \u201cYou\u2019re not Tot\u00f2 Riina to me, you\u2019re just my dad.\u201d Another of Mr. Riina\u2019s sons is in prison for committing four murders.Complete information on his survivors was not immediately available.Mr. Riina, who was rife with nicknames \u2014 he was also called U Curtu, or Shorty, because of his 5-foot-2 height \u2014 came from Corleone, a town in the Sicilian hinterland made famous as the birthplace of the fictional character Vito Corleone in the \u201cGodfather\u201d movies.But Mr. Riina\u2019s butchery was all too real. After serving time in his youth for killing a man in an argument, he became a soldier under the Mafia boss Luciano Leggio. He rose through the ranks, eliminating competitors and at times running his gang in hiding, though apparently always from Sicily. By the early 1980s, Mr. Riina had solidified his dominance over the island and its global criminal activities.His organization\u2019s tentacles reached deep into all facets of Italian life, from small businesses forced to pay for protection, to large sectors of commerce, where they skimmed millions of dollars. In Sicily, the mob had a reputation for delivering votes in exchange for favors. And nationally, Italy\u2019s leading politicians were often accused of entanglements with the sticky, and often invisible, Mafia web.The codes of omert\u00e0, or silence, that governed the Mafia and protected its bosses began to erode in the 1980s as rival families and informants turned state\u2019s evidence. Enormous trials in the early 1990s resulted in the arrest and jailing of more than 300 gangsters.But it was the bombing murders in Sicily of the two anti-Mafia magistrates, Mr. Borsellino (and five of his bodyguards) and Mr. Falcone (along with his wife and two bodyguards) that shook Italians the most and doomed Mr. Riina. Subsequent bombings in Rome, Milan and Florence in 1993 led to the crackdown on the Mafia and also contributed to the collapse of an old political guard corroded by corruption.With Mr. Riina in prison, other mobs around Italy grew in brutality and influence, including the Camorra in Naples and the \u2018Ndr\u00e0ngheta from Calabria, which operates a worldwide drug trade.But the specter of Mr. Riina, who rarely spoke in public, hung over the country. In one of his 1993 trials, he refused to address the allegations of one of his accusers.\u201cHe does not have my moral stature,\u201d Mr. Riina said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justice Department Sues to Block AT&T-Time Warner Merger", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner were to go through, the merger would create a media and telecommunications behemoth. By itself, AT&T is one of the nation\u2019s largest internet and telephone providers. With its 2015 acquisition of DirecTV, the country\u2019s largest satellite company, it also became the largest television distributor in the United States.The combined company would have an unrivaled ability to reach consumers through news and entertainment programming. Among Time Warner\u2019s properties are HBO, the home to \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d; Warner Bros., the studio behind blockbusters like \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and the Harry Potter film series; and Turner Broadcasting, which includes the news channel CNN and the sports-heavy TNT network.Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department\u2019s top antitrust regulator, said a union of the two companies would harm consumers and weaken competition.\u201cThis merger would greatly harm American consumers,\u201d Mr. Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in a statement. \u201cIt would mean higher monthly television bills and fewer of the new, emerging innovative options that consumers are beginning to enjoy.\u201dAT&T said it would defend the proposed deal in court, arguing that companies don\u2019t directly compete against each other and that the government hasn\u2019t challenged a similar kind of merger in decades.\u201cIt defies logic, and it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, said in a news conference on Monday after the suit was filed.The complaint was filed in Federal District Court for the District of Columbia against AT&T, DirecTV and Time Warner.In a call with reporters on Monday, a Justice Department official said the agency remained open to negotiating a settlement. To gain favor with the antitrust division, the official said, the companies would have to sell off some of their assets.During the news conference, Mr. Stephenson said that the Justice Department had a long history of approving similar mergers and that the company was not willing to part with any assets to get the deal approved.The government argued further that AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner would stifle innovation from online streaming firms like SlingTV, which competes with AT&T\u2019s DirecTV Now service. AT&T could withhold programs from those online providers.A combined AT&T and Time Warner, the complaint said, would be more harmful to consumers and larger in scope than Comcast-NBCUniversal. Comcast\u2019s cable and broadband service reaches more than one-third of the nation.\u201cBoth AT&T/DirecTV\u2019s video distribution services and Time Warner\u2019s TV networks are available nationwide, so the harm would occur throughout the country,\u201d the Justice Department said in its complaint.Mr. Stephenson has argued that AT&T needs media content in order to compete against internet firms like Google and Facebook for digital advertising dollars. With a big stock of television programming, it would also compete more effectively for subscribers against companies like Comcast and Verizon, which both own content.While speaking with reporters on Monday, Mr. Stephenson obliquely raised the issue of possible interference by the White House. President Trump, a frequent critic of news coverage by CNN, said during the 2016 presidential campaign that the deal should be blocked. Mr. Stephenson called the issue of CNN the \u201celephant in the room\u201d and speculated about its role in Mr. Delrahim\u2019s decision.\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said.Mr. Delrahim has argued that those remedies are not effective. Instead, he has spoken in favor of so-called structural remedies, like forcing a company to sell assets before a merger or acquisition.On Sept. 29, he was put in a position to act on that theory, when he was sworn in at the Justice Department.Throughout the summer, Justice Department officials and AT&T lawyers had discussed conditions that would allay antitrust concerns. During the talks, AT&T representatives said the combined company would abstain from anticompetitive business practices. At least some Justice Department staff members seemed open to the idea, according to two people familiar with the government review.The antitrust staff, which included holdovers from the Obama administration, presented Mr. Delrahim with three options: Accept the deal with conditions, accept the deal with divestitures, or block it altogether.Five weeks later, it became clear to AT&T that the deal was in trouble.Mr. Stephenson and the company\u2019s general counsel flew from Dallas to Washington a few days later to meet with the officials. After the meeting, the two sides were far from reaching a deal.According to AT&T sources, the Justice Department asked the company to rid itself of Turner or DirecTV, the satellite TV provider.Government officials, however, said AT&T had offered to sell CNN. By the end of the day\u2019s talks, Mr. Stephenson put out a statement saying he had never offered to sell CNN.The next day, on Nov. 9, Mr. Stephenson, speaking at The New York Times\u2019s DealBook conference, said the company was prepared to defend itself in court. He added that a significant merger of companies that were not direct competitors with each other had not been challenged in 40 years.In recent weeks, the Justice Department reached out to several state attorneys general who had been investigating the transaction to see if they would join the lawsuit as plaintiffs. None of them have yet joined, leaving the Justice Department as the sole plaintiff.In July, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, wrote a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions that asked, \u201cHas any employee of the White House or adviser to the president (either official or unofficial) had any contact with any Department of Justice employee regarding the AT&T/Time Warner transaction?\u201dMr. Delrahim has strongly denied there has been interference by the White House or Mr. Trump.Legal experts were divided on the merits of the suit.Gene Kimmelman, the president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group and a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, said, \u201cWe believe the Justice Department has presented a persuasive case that should satisfy any federal judge that this transaction is illegal and should be blocked, regardless of any politics surrounding the deal.\u201dRyan Radia, a legal and regulatory expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, took a different view. \u201cThe AT&T-Time Warner merger is a vertical transaction that wouldn\u2019t reduce competition in any distinct market,\u201d Mr. Radia said. \u201cUnder established antitrust principles, the government will have a difficult time showing a court that the deal is likely to harm consumers.\u201dAnxiety over the merger has simmered in the CNN newsroom for months, with staff members speculating about the role of the president\u2019s animosity toward the network.

{"Headline": "Skype Vanishes From App Stores in China, Including Apple\u2019s", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 One of the last foreign-run tools for online communication in China appears to be in trouble with the authorities here.For almost a month, Skype, the internet phone call and messaging service, has been unavailable on a number of sites where apps are downloaded in China, including Apple\u2019s app store in the country.\u201cWe have been notified by the Ministry of Public Security that a number of voice over internet protocol apps do not comply with local law. Therefore these apps have been removed from the app store in China,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said Tuesday in an emailed statement responding to questions about Skype\u2019s disappearance from the app store. \u201cThese apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201dThe removal led to a volley of complaints from Chinese users on internet message boards who were no longer able to pay for Skype\u2019s services through Apple. The users said that the disruption began in late October.Skype, which is owned by Microsoft, still functions in China, and its fate in the country is not yet clear. But its removal from the app stores is the most recent example of a decades-long push by China\u2019s government to control and monitor the flow of information online.While China has long wielded the most sophisticated and comprehensive internet controls in the world, under President Xi Jinping it has upped the ante, squelching most major foreign social networks and messaging apps one at a time.Beijing appears to have disabled these apps because they generally feature encryption options that make messages harder for the government to monitor. Such products also often run afoul of government rules that require the use of real-name identification for each and every account.A Microsoft spokesman said that Skype had been \u201ctemporarily removed\u201d from Apple\u2019s store and that the company was \u201cworking to reinstate the app as soon as possible.\u201d But the spokesman did not address Skype\u2019s absence from a variety of major third-party Android app stores. Because Google\u2019s services are largely blocked in China, Android users revert to alternate stores for downloads, and Skype\u2019s main app was not available on popular ones run by Chinese tech giants like Huawei and Xiaomi.But a key Chinese Communist Party meeting had already ended when Skype disappeared from the app stores \u2014 an indication that the cybersecurity law was the reason, and that the law, which began to take effect in June, is likely to have a deep and long-lasting impact on how the internet works in China. While the rules do not specifically ban foreign messaging apps, they do include general language that could be used to justify crackdowns.\u201cA broad reading of provisions in the law could be taken to mean that there is no longer support for allowing unfettered access to foreign communications tools such as Skype, WhatsApp, Signal and others that are outside the direct control of Chinese authorities,\u201d said Paul Triolo, the head of global technology at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.\u201cHence these also come under pressure, and are increasingly being throttled or blocked,\u201d he said.In that case, as in this one, it said that the apps violated Chinese rules and that it had taken them down to comply. Apple said this year that it planned to open a data center in China, also in response to China\u2019s new internet laws, which require that such centers be within the country\u2019s borders.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Dangerous Sprint Into the Future", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "To hear its executives tell it, Tesla is misunderstood because it is still perceived as a car manufacturer, when its goals are more complex and far-reaching. But at least some people have bought into these grand ambitions. This summer, Tesla\u2019s stock-market valuation at times rose above those of Ford and General Motors, and its worth exceeded $60 billion. It did not seem to matter to investors that the company had never made an annual profit, had missed its production targets repeatedly and had become enmeshed in controversy over its self-driving \u201cautopilot\u201d technologies, or that Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, had conceded that the value of his company, of which he owns about 22 percent, was \u201chigher than we have the right to deserve.\u201d Tesla was a headlong bet on the future, a huge wager on the idea of a better world. And its secretive Gigafactory was the arsenal for a full-fledged attack on the incumbent powers of the car and fossil-fuel industries. The factory would help validate Musk and his company\u2019s seriousness about leading humanity\u2019s turn to greener technologies, with a vision now encompassing solar roofing tiles and battery packs for home and industry. Most crucial, it involved producing millions of Tesla cars and trucks, all of which would be sleek, electric and self-driving.If ambitions were all it took, Tesla would be crowned the colossus of the global car industry. But rapidly accelerating new technologies have brought uncertainty as well. Automakers are encountering three destabilizing forces all at once: automation, electrification and sharing. And sizing up which companies will be the winners and losers in their wakes is in no way obvious. In terms of self-driving cars, it seems likely that long-established companies \u2014 General Motors and Ford, as well as BMW and Audi \u2014 will benefit from their substantial reserves of cash and deep manufacturing experience. Because these automakers can invest deeply in research (and spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy start-ups), they can remain competitive with companies less inherently cautious, like Tesla and Waymo, the spinoff of Google\u2019s self-driving projects.Tesla\u2019s goal has always been focused on going green, rather than creating the driverless future. (Its mission is emblazoned on its factory walls: \u201cTo accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.\u201d) Yet as the automobile industry settles on the consensus that self-driving cars are coming \u2014 their promise to improve safety and to help ride-sharing replace car ownership for many Americans propels their inevitability \u2014 Tesla finds itself in the midst of a contest to do both. This set of challenges should be enough for any company, especially one led by a chief executive whose time is compromised by other business commitments as a founder of a rocket company (SpaceX), a new tunneling operation (the Boring Company), a company planning a human-computer interface (Neuralink) and a nonprofit focused on the dangers of artificial intelligence (OpenAI). But Tesla has given itself a few others too. One is to essentially reinvent modern manufacturing processes at the Gigafactory. Yet another is to create the first mass-market electric car ever. In the meantime, a company that has never made much profit needs to somehow figure out how to do so \u2014 that is, to put itself in the black before financial losses and missed deadlines curdle any hope that Tesla inspires, among customers or stockholders, into skepticism.Still, the Gigafactory is considerably more than a battery factory: It\u2019s the physical embodiment of various technological breakthroughs the company \u2014 which just manufactured its 250,000th car \u2014 is trying to bring to its cars and energy-storage systems. Tesla makes motors here for its new Model 3 car, for instance, which are then trucked to its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., 240 miles away. When we went inside, after a labyrinthine walk through offices and up and down stairways, we reached a rapidly moving automated factory line, where batteries were being installed into Powerwalls and Powerpacks \u2014 the residential and industrial units that store energy collected from solar panels (or any electrical generator). Later in the month, devices like these would make their way to Puerto Rico, where Tesla rebuilt the power infrastructure for a children\u2019s hospital, and southern Australia, where the company is involved in a vast public project to shore up the country\u2019s electrical grid. \u201cWe think of this building as a product, because it is a product,\u201d my guide told me as we walked alongside a production line. Every machine had been scrutinized, every inch mapped out, every efficiency contemplated. Tesla had taken the highly unusual step of setting up a separate entity to take full control of the building\u2019s design, engineering and construction, reflecting Tesla\u2019s D.I.Y. ethos to achieve levels of vertical ownership and quality control that its executives believe are unreachable otherwise. The company had even concocted its own Tesla blend of coffee to serve near its cafeterias. \u201cIf we cannot get exactly what we want from the world,\u201d one executive told me, \u201cthen we have to go do it ourselves.\u201dTesla\u2019s grand plans in many respects depend on how much innovation the company can bring to the process of battery making. If the Gigafactory succeeds in reducing costs \u2014 one battery-industry analyst, Sam Jaffe, the director at Cairn Energy Research Advisors, told me he thinks the company should be able to drive down the price of its cells by 30 percent \u2014 multiple dividends will accrue to Tesla. Cheaper batteries mean more than cheaper cars. They mean Tesla can put larger battery packs into cars for the same cost, increasing the vehicles\u2019 range, power and appeal compared with the competition. At the same time, they could make its home energy-storage systems more efficient. Tesla could also gain an advantage in the race to produce autonomous vehicles, or A.V.s. The electric vehicles, or E.V.s, that Tesla wants to make autonomous have zero emissions. If self-driving cars go on rotation, say, in Uber and Lyft fleets, they could run 24-7, possibly leading to more cars on the road. \u201cOne of the concerns about automation is that it\u2019s going to drastically increase the miles we drive,\u201d Stephen Zoepf, the executive director at the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, told me. \u201cSo if we expect as a society that we\u2019re going to be driving a lot more, we obviously want to mitigate the environmental impact.\u201dAt the Gigafactory, J.B. Straubel, a Tesla founder and the company\u2019s chief technology officer, recounted the plant\u2019s origin story. In 2012, he did a back-of-the-envelope calculation and realized that if Tesla were to sell something on the order of 500,000 cars a year, it would require the world\u2019s entire output of lithium-ion batteries at the time. \u201cWe realized, holy crap, this means we need a huge factory,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause there was no way to do this just by putting in an order with some cell company and have them ship a few more.\u201d His projections were not far off. When we met in September, orders for the Model 3, which began production in midyear and has been billed as the company\u2019s first mass-market car, were around 455,000 through July, suggesting that the demand for E.V.s is far larger than any of the traditional automakers ever imagined. In the future, Straubel told me, Tesla plans to put up many more Gigafactories around the world, \u201cones that are actually quite a lot bigger than this one\u201d \u2014 and it would construct those itself too. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a big building that\u2019s full of equipment,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea here of the machine that builds the machine, and it\u2019s really true. This place is the embodiment of that.\u201dThe impression he wanted me to have, I think, was that Tesla, once it gets this prodigious machine humming, will become robotically unstoppable at cranking out smaller machines, a great big clean-energy perpetual-motion device. At the same time, the company\u2019s executives, from Straubel and Musk on down, were urging potential customers not to view each Tesla product in isolation but as parts of an ecosystem. The Tesla customer could soon use Tesla solar roof tiles during the day to charge up a Tesla Powerwall unit, filled with Gigafactory-made batteries \u2014 at night the Powerwall could in turn recharge the Tesla sedan. Perhaps the customer very much liked to drive? In that case, he or she might occasionally stop at one of the hundreds of Tesla \u201csupercharger\u201d stations in cities or along highways. Or maybe the owner didn\u2019t like to drive at all and preferred to be driven automatically. Tesla would soon straddle our peculiar moment, the transitional era where humans begin to take their hands off their machines. \u201cEvery car made since October of last year,\u201d Musk promised in early August, \u201cis capable of full autonomy, we believe.\u201dField quickly showed me the controls. There weren\u2019t many except for a few dials on the steering wheel. The screen to its right served as the car\u2019s dashboard. \u201cThis looks forward to an era of autonomy,\u201d Field explained, \u201cbut it\u2019s also simpler and easier to manufacture.\u201d That meant cheaper too, which was crucial: Tesla had concluded that every dollar saved on the cost of making the car would mean 100 more families could buy it in a year. As we drove through Palo Alto, the car was nimble and responsive, with the same kind of leaping acceleration that characterizes the Model S. But it took some time to get used to checking the screen to my right for my speed and autopilot settings. Field told me his team had concluded that it would be natural and intuitive for a younger generation. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting when you put young people in the car,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the way all kids navigate technology.\u201d It\u2019s also possible that the kids might do more navigating, or giving the car orders, than driving. Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla\u2019s design chief, later told me that in creating the car\u2019s interior, he faced the question of making a car that was affordable and stylish but also relevant for a future era. There was vigorous debate within the company about what to do if the Model 3 became truly autonomous. As time went on, von Holzhausen\u2019s group reasoned, this car would be driven less and would be driving more. Thus the decision to jettison dials and controls made sense, because the need for driver information would be reduced, and the central screen could mark routes and arrival times and double as an entertainment center. Those would be the essential tools. Or, as von Holzhausen put it, \u201cThe screen then became the hero of the vehicle.\u201dAll of Tesla\u2019s cars, including the Model 3, come with cameras and sensors; the sensors are small radar and ultrasonic devices situated around the car\u2019s exterior that could enable it, presuming the right software is eventually developed, to become self-driving. Because each Tesla car maintains a cellular connection, over-the-air improvements dispensed by the company are a regular feature \u2014 tweaking acceleration or braking capabilities through uploaded instructions, for instance. Sometimes the extent to which the company can improve or alter its cars\u2019 performance, even years after they left the factory, can be startling or unsettling, as was the case when Tesla temporarily extended the battery range for some drivers fleeing Hurricane Irma in Florida this summer. Self-driving, which Field assured me would ultimately come to pass with the right software and which Musk has repeatedly promoted to investors and customers, would allow Teslas to become something much more than they are. In the parlance of the Society of Automotive Engineers, which has quantified the capabilities a car must have to be considered self-driving, the vehicles will have nearly attained Level 5. This level denotes a safe and fully autonomous car that can operate in any place, and any conditions, without a driver.At the moment, Teslas are at Level 2. Their cameras, sensors and software support a more modest capability known as \u201cenhanced autopilot,\u201d which costs an additional $5,000 in a new Model S or Model 3. In certain road and weather conditions, the cars can regulate speed and braking in traffic, steer automatically, change lanes and parallel park autonomously. By some industry rankings, these features now help make Teslas among the safest cars on the road. But following the deadly crash of a Model S driver who was using autopilot in Florida in May 2016, the company reconfigured what the cars permit. When I tried the automated steering on my Model S during the drive from Reno to Palo Alto, for instance, the car chimed frequently in distress and warned me through a dashboard notice when I took my hands off the wheel for a few seconds. I\u2019d been informed that if this happened three times, the car would slow down, stop and rescind my autopilot privileges altogether. I didn\u2019t push it. Clearly, the car \u2014 and Tesla, too \u2014 still needed its driver.In the summer of 2016, Musk updated his vision for the company \u2014 \u201cMaster Plan, Part Deux.\u201d In the decade since Part 1, the acceptance of electric vehicles had grown to the point where some traditional carmakers, in a surprising turn, were beginning to speak of an inevitable transition to an era when all models were battery-powered. Entire countries (like China) and enormous markets (like California) were also considering eventual bans on internal-combustion engines. As E.V. technology seemed ascendant, a variety of factors outside the auto industry were creating real potential for self-driving vehicles: great gains in computer-processing power, cheaper hardware sensors, better mobile connectivity, advances in artificial intelligence and enhanced mapping software. In his updated master plan, Musk stated that every Tesla would now have self-driving capabilities and that the application of \u201cfleet learning\u201d \u2014 a variation on machine learning \u2014 would help the company someday deliver a car that was 10 times safer in self-driving mode than when controlled by a human.Musk also explained a new fundamental goal of the company. Tesla, he said, wanted to \u201cenable your car to make money for you when you aren\u2019t using it.\u201d In other words, any new Tesla could in due time be part of a sharing network, able to taxi strangers around while its owner worked, slept or did whatever. Most Americans\u2019 cars stay parked about 95 percent of the time. A Tesla would not. In the same way that Tesla\u2019s electric drive train made the American car more efficient, the Tesla network would make the total utilization of the vehicle more efficient, too.App-based sharing networks for cars already exist: These companies \u2014 Turo and Getaround, for instance \u2014 are different from, say, Zipcar, because they depend on peer-to-peer communications to arrange for rentals. In essence, they function like mobile Airbnbs, and in some cases have drawn the ire of users in the wake of driver crashes and insurance issues. A Tesla network would push this concept much further, involving perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of cars, all of them already connected to the internet. Yet such a business network, one Tesla executive told me, most likely wouldn\u2019t succeed unless Tesla\u2019s cars were fully autonomous. Any concerns about insurance and lending a car to a risky driver would disappear, he argued, if autonomous driving proves to be much safer than manual driving. Just as important, autonomy makes irrelevant the problem of getting the car to where it\u2019s needed next \u2014 it can be sent wherever it needs to go via mobile app. What\u2019s crucial here is that the Tesla network, if it becomes functional, can defray the cost of an electric car like the Model 3, which is billed as Tesla\u2019s affordable car but can easily surpass $50,000 with various options. If your car is making money for you when you\u2019re not using it, it effectively becomes a tool that uses the virtues of A.V.s to promote the market adoption of E.V.s.Over the course of several months, I often asked people at Tesla, as well as those working on autonomous technologies elsewhere, how far away the self-driving future might be. There was no solid consensus beyond somewhere between two and five years. I tended to believe that the timeline might extend much further and would depend on how tightly we regulate such vehicles and how we agree to define autonomy. Does it mean interstate driving on a sunny day? Or driving within a dedicated area on city streets? Is it a Level 5 overnight trip through heavy rain from Boston to Washington? A driverless taxi pickup on a crowded street under partial construction \u2014 orange cones, backhoes, chaos \u2014 as a nightclub lets out? Part of the debate concerns hardware and whether the collection of sensors that automotive engineers now build into their A.V.s can collect enough data to create a fully autonomous car. These sensors generally include radar, cameras and Lidar, the expensive laser-based technology that Tesla has so far declined to use. Many other A.V. researchers consider it essential. Lidar uses light waves, rather than radio waves, to map and \u201cread\u201d a car\u2019s environs.Musk has promised that before the end of this year, a Tesla vehicle will drive itself coast to coast completely on autopilot. A number of competitors \u2014 especially Waymo and General Motors \u2014 seem to be closing in on similarly ambitious goals. But it\u2019s worth noting that no Level 5 car has ever been publicly deployed, and it\u2019s doubtful one even exists; the coast-to-coast trip on autopilot, Musk suggested, wouldn\u2019t yet be an instance where a driver could, say, go to sleep at the wheel. What\u2019s more, no Level 4 car, where the vehicle is self-driving under certain weather and geographical conditions, has been put in regular service, either. In fact, while driver-assistance tools like autopilot can greatly reduce crash rates, no company or researcher has ever demonstrated that a robotic automobile can consistently operate in the everyday world more safely than a car with a human driver.An executive close to Musk told me that his boss believes that creating a true A.V. is a \u201csolvable\u201d problem, one probably less difficult than others he has encountered in various business endeavors \u2014 for instance, creating cheap, reusable rockets for SpaceX, his other major company, or pushing Tesla\u2019s Model S to such unlikely success. This may indeed prove true. But unlike other tech innovations, the development of driverless cars cannot count on something like Moore\u2019s Law, which has projected a doubling of computing power at regular intervals and has allowed Silicon Valley entrepreneurs a clear window into the future. Based on conversations with engineers on the A.V. front lines, the most difficult problem is rigging cars with sensors and software that can take a rich, clear, picture of every element in the surrounding environment \u2014 people, bikes, signs, obstacles \u2014 and then algorithmically choreograph the future.This challenge is as arduous for Tesla as it is for engineers everywhere working to solve it. And yet the exigencies of Tesla\u2019s business model add an additional layer of complexity. To reach its sustainability goals and become profitable, the company must make lots of cars that are electric and sporty and increasingly affordable; meanwhile, to prepare for the future, Tesla has to build cars that eventually won\u2019t need us. Some of the most experienced researchers working on A.V.s believe that these are two separate and possibly irreconcilable ambitions and that it makes more sense to focus on a pure driverless car, even if it proves to be a very expensive proposition at first, rather than follow Tesla\u2019s incrementalist policy, which would involve rolling out software on a regular basis until the driver does less and less and finally nothing at all. With the second approach, one Silicon Valley engineer said, \u201cthe market pressures that are going to be applied to those technologies mean that you\u2019re not going to climb up the safety and reliability curve\u201d to build a true A.V. Keeping the vehicle affordable is in constant tension with making the vehicle autonomous. Musk\u2019s optimism alone can\u2019t change that.Musk declined my interview requests over the course of several months. By early November, the number of Model 3 cars coming out of the factory had fallen far short of what Musk had promised, the company\u2019s stock price had taken a nose-dive and there appeared to be serious software and robotic glitches at the Gigafactory. Musk was said to be too busy to talk, which did not always square with his social-media postings: jokes, poems, photos of tunnels he was digging, links to stories about the dangers of artificial intelligence and, in one instance, footage of a camping excursion on the roof of the Gigafactory.The company\u2019s evasiveness and secrecy extended to self-driving cars, a subject it was unwilling to discuss in any detail. One Tesla engineer I spoke with, who works on autopilot systems, maintained that the company\u2019s camera and sensory hardware will prove good enough to get his team where it wants to go, which as a near-term goal means cars with a self-driving capability that is twice as good as a human driver (rather than 10 times as good, per the second master plan). By November, Musk was telling investors that the actual goal was to get the system simply on a par with a human driver and that that might require a more powerful computer in the cars, which Tesla would swap in free if necessary. Some customers have already paid $3,000 for a Tesla \u201cself-driving\u201d package (on top of the $5,000 for \u201cenhanced autopilot\u201d), based on Musk\u2019s assurances that the new cars have all the hardware necessary and will be autonomous once regulations and functional software are worked out.There\u2019s no clear indication of whether these efforts are on track, and in the past year, several engineers who ran Tesla\u2019s autopilot unit have left the company. In early October, Scott Miller, an executive involved with General Motors\u2019 self-driving efforts, charged publicly that Musk was \u201cfull of crap\u201d for claiming that his cars could offer self-driving capabilities with their current hardware. His assertions echo those of some other Tesla critics I spoke with: Without Lidar, or a more expensive hardware approach, Musk\u2019s cars may be at a significant disadvantage. Indeed, several people familiar with the company\u2019s A.V. work viewed its self-driving approach as a perilous one, given that there is no definitive way to predict how long it could take Tesla to satisfy the promises made to customers. In the best case, if A.I. and software breakthroughs ultimately transform cars like the Model 3 into self-driving vehicles, Musk will have pulled off something that perhaps seems impossible today. In the worst case, hundreds of thousands of owners will have cars that won\u2019t achieve the status of true A.V.s and can only hope that the sharing network of the master plan will someday become a reality.Tesla\u2019s setbacks, Musk noted in November, shouldn\u2019t eclipse the fact that the company has already grown faster by some measures than Ford when it rolled out the Model T in the early 1900s. He takes a longer view of his business than Wall Street analysts. In a recent TED interview, while discussing his plans for cities on Mars, he argued that it\u2019s a mistake to assume that technology gets better as time goes on. \u201cIt does not automatically improve,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade.\u201d He cited the Egyptian pyramids and Roman aqueducts and how the knowledge to build them was lost for hundreds, or even thousands, of years afterward. The relevance is striking in a time when the federal government would rather subsidize the growth of the coal and fossil-fuel industries than renewable energy and electric cars.Long before anyone saw Tesla as a legitimate player in the auto industry, Musk also appears to have understood that in taking chances that no established carmaker would, Tesla could be an innovative force to quicken our slow, plodding progress in transportation. Imagine Tesla didn\u2019t exist, Steve Jurvetson told me. \u201cWhat would the world look like? I have this sinking suspicion it wouldn\u2019t look that different than 10 years ago. A bunch of hybrid cars. A bunch of noise about hydrogen vehicles. You know, I don\u2019t think the world would look anything like today \u2014 where entire nations are saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to stop making gas cars.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe company\u2019s impact, real and potential, is all the more surprising considering that Musk has staked Tesla\u2019s success on the industrial equivalent of a shoestring, lacking the resources of established carmakers. He has used customer revenue, his own wealth, venture capital, bank and government loans, investments by other automakers and the American stock and debt markets to effectively fund a multibillion-dollar research-and-development project. In that way, he has led the industry to the start of a new era. And now his company, hindered by debilitating manufacturing bottlenecks and its extravagant promises of self-driving, is poised to find out whether, in laying the groundwork for an electric and autonomous future, he took one risk too many.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Did Facebook Really Need a Safety Check in New York?", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe alert, however, sent nervous ripples far beyond that single borough; it appeared that anyone listed on Facebook as a resident of New York City \u2014 whether they were actually there on Tuesday or not \u2014 was deemed to be a \u201cfriend in the area.\u201d And as such, they were asked to assure the world that they were indeed \u201csafe.\u201dIt created something of a social obligation among New Yorkers: Go to Facebook and declare yourself unharmed, or risk friends and relatives wondering why you haven\u2019t done so, perhaps while they assume the worst.The instinct to check in on those in dangerous areas long predates Safety Check\u2019s debut in 2014. Calls and text messages asking \u201care you O.K.?\u201d follow every natural disaster or terrorist attack, and Facebook said it created the feature after observing people in or near harm\u2019s way posting statuses to let their friends know they were fine. At its best, Safety Check offers swift reassurance, creating a catalog of people who might be in danger and notifying friends as soon as they declare themselves safe.\u201cI thought it was remarkably silly,\u201d said Hyman Rosen, a 56-year-old software engineer who works about three miles away near Grand Central Terminal. \u201cManhattan\u2019s got a few million people in it, and they\u2019re all going to go push buttons on Facebook saying I\u2019m O.K.?\u201dJoel Califa, 29, a senior product designer at GitHub who lives in Brooklyn, said he initially liked the purpose of Safety Check as a way of reassuring loved ones, but was irritated when he was notified on Monday that \u201ca few of my friends wanted to know if I was O.K.\u201dOne of the friends told him that Facebook had delivered a notification that Mr. Califa was in the area, then suggested the friend ask Mr. Califa if he was safe.\u201cInstead of calming my friends, Facebook was now alarming them with the possibility that something might have happened to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIn an attempt to increase usage, they\u2019ve undermined that original goal.\u201dIn an email late Tuesday, a Facebook spokesman said: \u201cThe goal of Safety Check is to ensure people feel safe and connected during a crisis and not to create false alarm or panic.\u201dThe spokesman, Eric Porterfield, pointed to a February news release, which also noted that officials were \u201clistening to feedback to make the tool more useful and relevant in the future.\u201dBack then, Facebook employees decided when an event was prominent enough, but the company began automating the service in June 2016. Now, the feature activates after a pair of \u201cglobal crisis reporting agencies\u201d have alerted Facebook that an event has occurred and an unspecified number of people begin discussing it. The change resulted in far more activations, and Facebook touts it as allowing individual communities to determine worthiness, as opposed to a small set of employees.Once the feature goes live, people in the impacted area are prompted to mark themselves safe. When they do that, their friends are notified and have the option of asking whether others are safe, too.Declaring oneself to be \u201csafe\u201d or noting that the event \u201cdoesn\u2019t apply to me\u201d requires just a single click \u2014 and many users took the second out of their day Tuesday to assuage the concerns of family and friends who might not differentiate Stuyvesant High School in Lower Manhattan from Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn.Others, though, found requests to announce themselves as \u201csafe\u201d to be redundant, self-centered, or both. A few seemed shocked to have been told by Facebook that a person with whom they had not spoken in years suddenly was concerned about their well-being.Jack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should We Even Want to Live Past 110?", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs a journalist, you learn how many stories end with the humbling realization that the journey has only just begun.No one knows. Even under the best of circumstances, it could take a decade to suss out such a drug, and the trial to test it could last \u2014 well, a long lifetime.But the point of a quest story also sometimes turns out not to be about its stated quarry. And in this case, I had in mind another question to which the reporting did provide some answers: Is living to 110 even a goal worth pursuing?\u201cWhat kind of a question is \u2018Do you like being alive?\u201d\u2019 asked one viewer, whose sentiments were echoed by others.But I was not alone in wondering.Paul Cooper, the grandson of Besse Cooper, who wore the oldest-living-person-on-Earth mantle in 2012, summed up for me the zeitgeist\u2019s love-hate relationship with extreme longevity: \u201cPeople would say \u2018That\u2019s amazing,\u201d\u2019 he said of the reactions to his grandmother, who died at 116. \u201cThen in the next breath, they would say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to live that long.\u201d\u2019As I probed the happiness quotient of supercentenarians, I also tried, in interviews with the story\u2019s subjects but also with my own friends and family, to unpack the reasons for our apprehension.Maybe it was that we associate old age with illness?But supercentenarians, as the 110-and-older crowd are known, are remarkably healthy on average until shortly before death. The idea, as longevity researchers will assure you, is to lengthen not life span but \u201chealth span.\u201dWere we worried about loneliness?But with a magic supercentenarian-inspired drug, we would all live to somewhere near the limits of the human life span (which appears to be around 120).Or going broke?But one line of economic thought holds that, rather than plunging us into poverty, societal wealth would boom as a result of plummeting health care costs and increased productivity.It was an email from my father, who is 74 and recently retired, that rang the most true to me on this front. During the time I was working on this story \u2014 which I started in 2014 and proceeded to report in fits and starts \u2014 he took to sending me old photographs of myself and family members, often with subject lines like \u201cgather ye rosebuds while ye may.\u201dWhile these may be a form of meta-commentary on the bittersweet passage of time, sometimes they seem more like an admonition: Stop rewriting those nut grafs and get out of the house; life (as he also has often told me) \u201cis not a dress rehearsal.\u201dThe most visceral fear, when I explored this with others, too, seemed to be that having extra time later could make us squander the time we have now. And yet, from all I could glean about supercentenarians from their family members, media reports, and James Clement, the collector of their DNA, they were nearly all inveterate gatherers of rosebuds.To my indelicate question, Mr. Matthews answered that yes, he did indeed still enjoy life, and never had stopped. In this he was joined by fellow supercentenarians James McCoubrey, who frequented senior online chat rooms, pretending he was merely in his 70s, Will Miles Clark, who had just driven himself from Tucson, Az., to a family birthday party in Denver, Colo when he donated his DNA, and Goldie Michelson, an avid reader of library books.So should we all aspire to 110-plus?\u201cIt depends,\u201d Ms. Michelson\u2019s 86-year-old daughter, Renee, told me, echoing my own father, \u201con how you live.\u201dThat may be the secret to life at any age.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I Could Not Forget What Happened to Me That Night With Him\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileThe Facebook post, coming shortly after the terrorist attack by Islamist extremists at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in November 2015, fell like a bombshell in the febrile atmosphere in France.Henda Ayari, a French citizen of North African parentage, posted two photographs of herself \u2014 one in a full black Islamic veil, the other in a tight jacket and T-shirt, bareheaded \u2014 and wrote a bitter denunciation of Salafism and its encouragement of violent jihad among young French Muslims.She described how, as a student, she had been drawn into the fundamentalist Islamist sect, and how, after 10 years of marriage and with three children, she had fought to break out of what she calls the straitjacket of radical Islam.\u201cIt was something in my heart,\u201d she said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cI had a lot of difficulty with this for years, and I could not forget what happened to me that night with him, and so I decided.\u201cI just thought at that moment to free myself, free my words, and that did me some good, it relieved me a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, the name, I did not think it would cause such a noise.\u201dThe same day Ms. Ayari exposed him on Facebook, she filed a complaint about the assault with the police in her hometown, Rouen, France. She has accused Mr. Ramadan of rape, sexual assault, willful violence, harassment and intimidation, her lawyers said.Ms. Ayari, 40, is a fighter.After the 2015 Facebook post, she went on to write a book, \u201cI Chose to Be Free: A Survivor of Salafism in France,\u201d which exposed the mental and physical subjugation that she and other women suffered inside the Salafi community. She also described a sexual assault, though she did not identify her alleged assailant by name.That stance brought her threats and condemnation, even from her own family. She is not on speaking terms with either of her parents, and her eldest son, now 18, has sided with her Salafi ex-husband against her. Now, she has once again been subjected to torrents of online abuse.She grew up in a working-class family in Rouen, the daughter of an Algerian father and Tunisian mother, both Muslims but not particularly religious. Her parents divorced when she was young and both remarried, leaving Ms. Ayari feeling insecure and unwanted.She enrolled in college to study psychology and began to explore religion. She started to wear the veil and was quickly welcomed into a circle of conservative Muslims. Within months, they had set her up with a Tunisian Salafi who lived in Lyon. They married when she was 21.One of the first things her husband, Bachir, did was buy her a jilbab, which covers a woman from head to toe, and a niqab, the veil that hides all but the eyes. The niqab was, in his words, the height of religiosity, the female garb that most pleased Allah.For the next 10 years, Ms. Ayari lived a life of almost complete seclusion, bearing three children, sometimes spending days without leaving her bedroom and barely talking to anyone outside her husband\u2019s family and immediate circle. Salafis teach that only they follow the true way, drawn from the time of the Prophet Muhammad. They reject association with those outside their sect.The family survived on government aid, as her husband spent his time with Salafi companions at the mosque. As the children grew up, she urged him to find work but he complained that racism and discrimination in France prevented him from finding a job. She gradually came to regard his Salafi dress and long beard as an excuse not to work.As their marriage deteriorated, she said, her husband became abusive. When a social services official told her she lived in a prison and advised her to seek psychological help, she realized she had to break out.\u201cIt is a trap, especially for women, because they say you have to take the veil, and marry and not study, and they want you just to be a submissive woman,\u201d she wrote.She began to question the patriarchal Salafist strictures that command adherents to obey the example of the prophet unquestioningly, and that seemed arranged particularly to suit men.Eventually, Ms. Ayari fled with her children. But restarting her life as a single mother while grappling with a crisis of faith proved to be too big a leap. She suffered a nervous breakdown and lost custody of her children for two years.The internet, and particularly Facebook, has been her companion along the way. As she started questioning the extreme ideology of Salafism, she began following the teaching of Mr. Ramadan, who became an online instructor and mentor, eventually suggesting they meet in Paris where he was attending a conference.She said she viewed him as a saint, and was shocked and terrified by what she says was his violent assault and his threats to her to remain silent afterward.Since naming him as her attacker, she says she has been inundated with insults and abuse. \u201cThe reaction, the buzz, really frightened me,\u201d she said in the phone interview.\u201cI am very scared of being recognized when I go out in the street,\u201d she went on. \u201cI am scared that they will hurt my children, that they know where I live. It is very hard.\u201dYet, she says the messages she has received from other women, many of them in abusive marriages or struggling with similar dilemmas over abandoning the veil, give her a sense of purpose.Two years ago she founded a nonprofit association called Liberatrices, which helps women in the same straits she had been in. She gives talks in schools and at workshops against radical Islam, and helps women seeking legal advice and refuge from abuse.Instead of being hit with fines, women should be made to attend educational workshops, she said. \u201cYou need to resolve the problem with discussion, comprehension, softness and above all not exclusion.\u201dAnd countering the Salafist message, she said, is essential.\u201cI took a long time to open my eyes, to understand that they indoctrinated us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important to say to all women that they should speak out, that they should not be scared, that they are not inferior beings to men, that they are equal to men, that they should fight to be respected and that you do not have to wear a veil to be a good Muslim.\u201dEloise Stark contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eternal Youth in Tompkins Square Park", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe lookThe photographer Daniel Weiss found versions of his teenage self in the East Village of Manhattan.Anyone who has used Ninth Street to cross Tompkins Square Park has seen the skateboarders who occupy its northeast corner. Many of them call it the T.F. Others call it Thompson\u2019s. T.F. stands for \u201ctraining facility\u201d (though very little official training takes place here), and Thompson\u2019s comes out of a phonetic misunderstanding that comes from knowing a place verbally, rather than on a map.While most suburban skaters seek spots outside of city centers, the best urban skate spots can be found at the center of any city. However, as New York City continues to gentrify and to pump millions into purpose-built skate parks, the city forces this peripheral movement: Most skate parks can now be found under bridges and on the edges of Manhattan. The T.F. at Tompkins remains a rare hub, a throwback to a grittier era of the city\u2019s history.I first met Daniel Weiss at the T.F. 15 years ago. He was a stocky redheaded teenager with a precise style and tasteful trick selection. Skateboarding levels out age differences in the face of skill. Danny was one of the good kids, and I watched him cultivate other interests outside of skateboarding as he matured. Danny has always searched for archetypes. When he quit skating to get into motorcycles, he got into classic bikes. As a photographer, he shoots medium-format street portraits of New Yorkers who belong to a bygone era. Here, his subject is coming of age in an ever-replicating scene that seems frozen in time, yet no longer includes us.Perhaps we no longer have the patience for it, or the fearlessness. To be a skater, you must repeatedly attempt an inconceivably difficult task, knowing that you will injure yourself along the way. It takes months, sometimes years, to learn these tricks and to get them consistent. That means months of bruises, scrapes, broken bones and sometimes worse. In turn, the sport helps skaters commit to other interests fully, despite their grave risks. Take Danny and his motorcyles. On April 16, 2016, he was involved in a near-fatal crash. He lost control on a dirt track upstate and hit a concrete wall at 80 m.p.h. He almost died and only recently has been able to walk without a cane. He may never skate again. He might not want to.When looking at photography, a reciprocal exchange happens between the viewer and the subject. Whether we want to or not, we often see \u2014 or try to see \u2014 ourselves in the subjects.Danny, who is in his early 30s, looks back to a place and to people with whom he has shared a huge part of his past. These teenagers are on the cusp of adulthood, the moment when clothes are less of an aspirational costume, who you want to be, and become a statement of who you are. Some of them skate, some of them just hang out. This is a new thing. When Danny and I were regulars, skateboarding wasn\u2019t quite as cool, and the only people we shared the T.F. with were drunks, drug users and drug dealers. A lot has changed over 15 years. Skateboarding, like the neighborhood, has grown up and acquired a marketable sheen. It is difficult not to see in these kids, who now dress like the ones in the movie \u201cKids,\u201d my contemporaries in the mid-\u201990s. Who knows how long the park will be a haven for them, or what they will become? Small, seemingly insubstantial butterfly-wing youthful decisions can have life-changing consequences. Who knows how long skaters will be allowed to hang out at the T.F., considering the skyrocketing property values of real estate in the East Village?As perhaps some of Danny\u2019s experiences at the T.F. cultivated his unique perspective, and set him on a course that almost ended his life, his photographs of kids in the park remind us of the rare delicacy of youth \u2014 and open space \u2014 in the city.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Voice of Hate in America\u2019s Heartland", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUBER HEIGHTS, Ohio \u2014 Tony and Maria Hovater were married this fall. They registered at Target. On their list was a muffin pan, a four-drawer dresser and a pineapple slicer.Ms. Hovater, 25, was worried about Antifa bashing up the ceremony. Weddings are hard enough to plan for when your fianc\u00e9 is not an avowed white nationalist.But Mr. Hovater, in the days leading up to the wedding, was somewhat less anxious. There are times when it can feel toxic to openly identify as a far-right extremist in the Ohio of 2017. But not always. He said the election of President Trump helped open a space for people like him, demonstrating that it is not the end of the world to be attacked as the bigot he surely is: \u201cYou can just say, \u2018Yeah, so?\u2019 And move on.\u201dIt was a weeknight at Applebee\u2019s in Huber Heights, a suburb of Dayton, a few weeks before the wedding. The couple, who live in nearby New Carlisle, were shoulder to shoulder at a table, young and in love. He was in a plain T-shirt, she in a sleeveless jean jacket. She ordered the boneless wings. Her parents had met him, she said, and approved of the match. The wedding would be small. Some of her best friends were going to be there. \u201cA lot of girls are not really into politics,\u201d she said.In Ohio, amid the row crops and rolling hills, the Olive Gardens and Steak \u2019n Shakes, Mr. Hovater\u2019s presence can make hardly a ripple. He is the Nazi sympathizer next door, polite and low-key at a time the old boundaries of accepted political activity can seem alarmingly in flux. Most Americans would be disgusted and baffled by his casually approving remarks about Hitler, disdain for democracy and belief that the races are better off separate. But his tattoos are innocuous pop-culture references: a slice of cherry pie adorns one arm, a homage to the TV show \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d He says he prefers to spread the gospel of white nationalism with satire. He is a big \u201cSeinfeld\u201d fan.\u201cI guess it seems weird when talking about these type of things,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m coming at it in a mid-90s, Jewish, New York, observational-humor way.\u201dIts leaders claim to oppose racism, though the Anti-Defamation League says the group \u201chas participated in white supremacist events all over the country.\u201d On its website, a swastika armband goes for $20.If the Charlottesville rally came as a shock, with hundreds of white Americans marching in support of ideologies many have long considered too vile, dangerous or stupid to enter the political mainstream, it obscured the fact that some in the small, loosely defined alt-right movement are hoping to make those ideas seem less than shocking for the \u201cnormies,\u201d or normal people, that its sympathizers have tended to mock online.And to go from mocking to wooing, the movement will be looking to make use of people like the Hovaters and their trappings of normie life \u2014 their fondness for National Public Radio, their four cats, their bridal registry.\u201cWe need to have more families. We need to be able to just be normal,\u201d said Matthew Heimbach, the leader of the Traditionalist Worker Party, in a podcast conversation with Mr. Hovater. Why, he asked self-mockingly, were so many followers \u201cabnormal\u201d?Mr. Hovater replied: \u201cI mean honestly, it takes people with, like, sort of an odd view of life, at first, to come this way. Because most people are pacified really easy, you know. Like, here\u2019s some money, here\u2019s a nice TV, go watch your sports, you know?\u201dHe added: \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re seeing more and more normal people come is because things have gotten so bad. And if they keep getting worse, we\u2019ll keep getting more, just, normal people.\u201dMr. Hovater\u2019s face is narrow and punctuated with sharply peaked eyebrows, like a pair of air quotes, and he tends to deliver his favorite adjective, \u201cedgy,\u201d with a flat affect and maximum sarcastic intent. It is a sort of implicit running assertion that the edges of acceptable American political discourse \u2014 edges set by previous generations, like the one that fought the Nazis \u2014 are laughable.\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m some \u2018edgy\u2019 Republican,\u201d he says, while flatly denouncing the concept of democracy.\u201cI don\u2019t even think those things should be \u2018edgy,\u2019\u201d he says, while defending his assertion that Jews run the worlds of finance and the media, and \u201cappear to be working more in line with their own interests than everybody else\u2019s.\u201dHis political evolution \u2014 from vaguely leftist rock musician to ardent libertarian to fascist activist \u2014 was largely fueled by the kinds of frustrations that would not seem exotic to most American conservatives. He believes the federal government is too big, the news media is biased, and that affirmative action programs for minorities are fundamentally unfair.Ask him how he moved so far right, and he declares that public discourse has become \u201cso toxic that there\u2019s no way to effectively lobby for interests that involve white people.\u201d He name-drops Murray Rothbard and Hans-Hermann Hoppe, architects of \u201canarcho-capitalism,\u201d with its idea that free markets serve as better societal regulators than the state. And he refers to the 2013 science-fiction movie \u201cPacific Rim,\u201d in which society is attacked by massive monsters that emerge from beneath the Pacific Ocean.\u201cSo the people, they don\u2019t ask the monsters to stop,\u201d he says. \u201cThey build a giant robot to try to stop them. And that\u2019s essentially what fascism is. It\u2019s like our version of centrally coming together to try to stop another already centralized force.\u201dMr. Hovater grew up on integrated Army bases and attended a mostly white Ohio high school. He did not want for anything. He experienced no scarring racial episodes. His parents, he says, were the kinds of people who \u201calways assume things aren\u2019t going well. But they don\u2019t necessarily know why.\u201dHe is adamant that the races are probably better off separated, but he insists he is not racist. He is a white nationalist, he says, not a white supremacist. There were mixed-race couples at the wedding. Mr. Hovater said he was fine with it.\u201cThat\u2019s their thing, man,\u201d he said.Online it is uglier. On Facebook, Mr. Hovater posted a picture purporting to show what life would have looked like if Germany had won World War II: a streetscape full of happy white people, a bustling American-style diner and swastikas everywhere.\u201cWhat part is supposed to look unappealing?\u201d he wrote.After he attended the Charlottesville rally, in which a white nationalist plowed his car into a group of left-wing protesters, killing one of them, Mr. Hovater wrote that he was proud of the comrades who joined him there: \u201cWe made history. Hail victory.\u201dIn German, \u201cHail victory\u201d is \u201cSieg heil.\u201dBefore white nationalism, his world was heavy metal. He played drums in two bands, and his embrace of fascism, on the surface, shares some traits with the hipster\u2019s cooler-than-thou quest for the most extreme of musical subgenres. Online, he and his allies can also give the impression that their movement is one big laugh \u2014 an enormous trolling event put on by self-mocking, politically incorrect kids playing around on the ash heap of history.On the party\u2019s website, the swastika armband is formally listed as a \u201cNSDAP LARP Armband.\u201d NSDAP was the abbreviation for Hitler\u2019s Nazi Party. LARP stands for \u201cLive-Action Role Playing,\u201d a term originally meant to describe fantasy fans who dress up as wizards and warlocks.But the movement is no joke. The party, Mr. Hovater said, is now approaching 1,000 people. He said that it has held food and school-supply drives in Appalachia. \u201cThese are people that the establishment doesn\u2019t care about,\u201d he said.Marilyn Mayo, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, estimated that the Traditionalist Worker Party had a few hundred members at most, while Americans who identify as \u201calt-right\u201d could number in the tens of thousands.\u201cIt is small in the grand scheme of things, but it\u2019s one of the segments of the white supremacist movement that\u2019s grown over the last two years,\u201d she said.It was midday at a Panera Bread, and Mr. Hovater was describing his political awakening over a turkey sandwich. He mentioned books by Charles Murray and Pat Buchanan. He talked about his presence on 4chan, the online message board and alt-right breeding ground (\u201cThat\u2019s where the scary memes come from,\u201d he deadpanned). He spoke dispassionately about the injustice of affirmative action, about the \u201cmalice directed toward white people\u201d in popular media, about how the cartoon comedy \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d was the last TV show to portray \u201ca straight white male patriarch\u201d in a positive light.\u201cI think he was a guy who really believed in his cause,\u201d he said of Hitler. \u201cHe really believed he was fighting for his people and doing what he thought was right.\u201dHe said he wanted to see the United States become \u201can actually fair, meritocratic society.\u201d Absent that, he would settle for a white ethno-state \u201cwhere things are fair, because there\u2019s no competing demographics for government power or for resources.\u201dHis fascist ideal, he said, would resemble the early days in the United States, when power was reserved for landowners \u201cand, you know, normies didn\u2019t really have a whole hell of a lot to say.\u201dHis faith in mainstream solutions slipped as he toured the country with one of the metal bands. \u201cI got to see people who were genuinely hurting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe played coast to coast, but specifically places in Appalachia, and a lot of the Eastern Seaboard had really been hurt.\u201dIn 2012, Mr. Hovater was incensed by the media coverage of the Trayvon Martin shooting, believing the story had been distorted to make a villain of George Zimmerman, the white man who shot the black teenager. By that time, he and Ms. Hovater had been dating for a year or two. She was a small-town girl who had fallen away from the Catholic Church (\u201cIt was just really boring\u201d), and once considered herself liberal.But in the aftermath of the shooting, Ms. Hovater found herself on social media \u201cquestioning the official story,\u201d taking Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s side and finding herself blocked by some of her friends. Today, she says, she and Mr. Hovater are \u201cpretty lined up\u201d politically.As they let their views be known, friends left and friends stayed.\u201cHis views are horrible and repugnant and hate-filled,\u201d said Ethan Reynolds, a Republican and city councilman in New Carlisle, Ohio, who said he had befriended Mr. Hovater without knowing his extremism. \u201cHe was an acquaintance I regret knowing.\u201dJake Nolan, a guitarist in one of the bands Mr. Hovater played in, stuck with him. \u201cThere are people who literally go around Sieg Heiling,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you have the people who just want the right to be proud of their heritage\u201d \u2014 people, he said, who are standing up against \u201cwhat appears to be an increasingly anti-white America.\u201dSoon Mr. Hovater was telling people that he would be running for a council seat in his hometown, New Carlisle, population 5,600. The announcement caught the attention of the Southern Poverty Law Center and the heavy metal press. But he never filed papers.On a recent weekday evening, Mr. Hovater was at home, saut\u00e9ing minced garlic with chili flakes and waiting for his pasta to boil. The cats were wandering in and out of their tidy little rental house. Books about Mussolini and Hitler shared shelf space with a stack of Nintendo Wii games. A day earlier, a next-door neighbor, whom Mr. Hovater doesn\u2019t know very well, had hung a Confederate flag in front of his house.\u201cThis is kind of brackish territory here,\u201d Mr. Hovater said. \u201cA lot of people consider Cincinnati the most northern Southern city.\u201dThe pasta was ready. Ms. Hovater talked about how frightening it was this summer to watch from home as the Charlottesville rally spun out of control.

{"Headline": "A Prince\u2019s Uncertain Fate Deepens Mystery in Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookIt has been more than three weeks since Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the most prominent investor in Saudi Arabia, was arrested on a Saturday night as part of the sweeping detention of several dozen elites. Since then, he has been holed up inside the Saudi version of prison for the ultrawealthy: the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, about a 10-minute drive from the prince\u2019s home.He hasn\u2019t been heard from, nor have any charges against him been made public.Because he was the longtime public face of finance for Saudi Arabia, Prince Alwaleed\u2019s arrest \u2014 and the lack of transparency around what has happened to him \u2014 is causing increasing consternation among his various business partners and in much of the Western business community.His arrest has also created a sense of uncertainty among investors about whether to do business with Saudi Arabia and, by extension, could affect some of its partners, like Masayoshi Son\u2019s $100 billion SoftBank fund, in which the kingdom holds a 45 percent stake. It could also affect the highly anticipated public offering of the state-owned oil company, Aramco, planned for next year.\u201cI\u2019m surprised that he got swept up in this, because he had always been such a positive figure both in reality and symbolically for Saudi progressivism \u2014 for participating in the modern world, in modern finance,\u201d said Richard Parsons, a former chief executive of Time Warner and former chairman of Citigroup, in which the prince had also been a large investor.\u201cWhat is this all about?\u2019\u2019 Mr. Parsons added. \u201cThere is no transparency. Nobody understands what is going on. It is unclear why or what the rationale is. If you\u2019re an investor or a businessperson, you\u2019re going to take a step back from the starting line and say, \u2018I\u2019m just going to keep my money in my pocket.\u2019\u201dKnown as the Warren Buffett of the Middle East, the prince has worked with Bill Gates on various projects, including their ownership of the Four Seasons resorts and several philanthropic endeavors.\u201cI\u2019m only aware of what I\u2019ve read in the press, and I can\u2019t speculate,\u201d Mr. Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder, said by email. \u201cPrince Alwaleed has been an important partner in my foundation\u2019s work to ensure that kids around the world receive lifesaving vaccinations. We\u2019ve worked together to help stop the spread of polio, measles and other preventable diseases. His commitment to philanthropy is inspiring.\u201dThe Saudi Arabian government has officially described the arrest of Prince Alwaleed and dozens of other princes and businessmen as part of a long-planned \u201canticorruption\u201d effort. Inside the kingdom, the arrests were welcomed by many, especially by millennials, who think their job prospects and economic growth have been slowed by a culture of graft.But outside the country, questions remain. The arrests have been called everything from a power grab by the crown prince, to a shakedown, to a Saudi version of \u201cthe Saturday Night Massacre.\u201dStill, the kingdom expects to reach \u201csettlements\u201d with those who have been arrested, and the crown prince said he expected to recover $100 billion. It remains unclear where those who reach settlements will go after leaving the Ritz; some are expected to remain living in Saudi Arabia while others may leave the country.The arrest of Prince Alwaleed, however, has seemingly made some skittish and is likely to slow the pace of investment, at least in the short term.\u201cWhen people talk about where to invest outside of the U.S., you always hear the term \u2018rule of law,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Parsons, who was among a dozen or so American executives who spoke to me about their concerns, most asking for anonymity so as not to upset their relationship with the Saudis.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to take for granted if nothing untoward has happened or there hasn\u2019t been any turbulence,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as you see something that is difficult to understand in terms of how investors and investments are being treated, \u2018rule of law\u2019 all of sudden leaps up off the canvas.\u201dSeveral executives who do business in the kingdom said it wasn\u2019t the mass arrests of other public officials or elites that concerned them so much as the arrest of Prince Alwaleed himself. It put a prominent face on the unsettling news.His arrest has led to rampant speculation about the charges against him, with many questioning whether the kingdom might seek to take over his ownership of Rotana, the largest entertainment company in the region. The kingdom has sought more and more control over messaging, and Rotana owns television, film, music, magazine and radio assets.Some close to the prince privately question why, if he was under investigation, the government granted him permission to acquire a 16 percent stake in Saudi Fransi from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole for $1.5 billion in September \u2014 one of the largest finance deals in the country. The deal required the approval of regulators who would have surely known about the inquiry. The crown prince told Mr. Friedman that government had been working on the corruption cases for the past two years.Within the world of Silicon Valley, which the crown prince has been assiduously courting over the past several years \u2014 including a trip last year when he met with Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive \u2014 there are lingering questions about the implications of taking money from the country. Saudi Arabia took a direct stake in Uber, for example, and through its investment in Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund it has acquired pieces of companies like WeWork and Slack. Privately, some investors also grumble about the close ties that the Saudi government has with President Trump, an unpopular figure with many in Silicon Valley.Uber\u2019s new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, told me two weeks ago that the company had discussed whether to take the Saudi money. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there, but at the time when we took the money \u2014 because I asked the team about it \u2014 the company definitely talked about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say the most important issue for the company was the women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia.\u201dHe added: \u201cAnd the company explicitly talked about how we actually believe that women should be able to drive. And since then, the changes that we\u2019re seeing \u2014 the cultural changes that we\u2019re seeing in Saudi Arabia \u2014 they are unambiguously positive.\u201dWith some more transparency and answers about the fate of Prince Alwaleed, many more American business executives and investors would feel the same way.An earlier version of this article misidentified a former title of Richard Parsons. He was the former chairman of Citigroup, not the former chief executive.Advertisement"}

He also allegedly abused a second girl in March of this year.Mr. Butler, who was a pastor at Kingdom Encounter Family Worship Center in Detroit, about an hour from Toledo, was also indicted on sex trafficking charges involving a third girl who was abused between 2015 and March 2017, the court documents said.\u201cAll three have religious affiliations and knew each other in that capacity,\u201d said Michael Tobin, a spokesman for the United States attorney\u2019s office. \u201cAll three claim to be ministers in one form or another.\u201dThe charges are part of a superseding indictment that expands sex trafficking charges originally handed down in April against Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Haynes, and adds Mr. Butler as a defendant in the case. \u201cIt takes the three of them and loops them all into one big conspiracy with three victims,\u201d said Mr. Tobin.The three men will remain in custody until their next hearing, scheduled for January.Allison Folmar, a lawyer for Mr. Jenkins, said on Thursday that he had \u201cdone a lot of good\u201d in his community, \u201cbut all of that is clearly overshadowed with what he is facing right now.\u201dA lawyer for Mr. Butler, Adam S.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Visit to China Provides a Propaganda Bonanza", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 #TrumpHasArrived! The Chinese news media broke out the hashtags this week as soon as Air Force One landed in Beijing, delivering both President Trump and an irresistible propaganda opportunity for President Xi Jinping of China.Government censors helped control the message, deleting posts about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on North Korea.Here is a look at how Mr. Trump\u2019s visit, part of a five-country tour of Asia, played in the Chinese news media.The photo reinforces the view that world leaders see Mr. Xi as a great leader, and that China is a superpower on par with the United States.A hallmark of Mr. Xi\u2019s tenure has been a re-emphasis on traditional Chinese culture, after decades in which the Communist Party sought to bury much of the country\u2019s history. Critics say Mr. Xi is selective in retelling history, and that he is seeking to counter the spread of foreign influences.An offhand comment by Mr. Trump in the Forbidden City gave Mr. Xi a chance to promote his nationalist version of history.Mr. Trump asked Mr. Xi if it was true that China\u2019s history dated back 5,000 years, before adding that \u201cI guess the oldest culture, they say, is Egypt,\u201d with 8,000 years of history.Mr. Xi interjected, saying that China had the longest continuous civilization in history. \u201cWe have the same black hair and yellow skin that we inherited,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cWe call ourselves descendants of the dragon.\u201dA clip of the exchange between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi soon went viral. So did a video of Mr. Trump\u2019s granddaughter, Arabella Kushner, singing a Chinese song from 1953. Chinese internet users celebrated the video as another sign that Chinese culture had made it on the world stage.Mr. Trump was warmly received in China\u2019s most prominent news outlets, which praised him as a pragmatic leader who, nevertheless, could be friendlier toward China. But in some forums online, the president was mocked, with social media users describing him as goofy, impulsive, clownish and cute.On WeChat, China\u2019s popular messaging app, users circulated posts analyzing the clothes worn by Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania. Some users described the president\u2019s necktie as \u201cshallow and exaggerated.\u201dA widely shared article delivered a lengthy analysis of Mr. Trump\u2019s psyche, which suggested that flattery was the trick to winning him over.Another well circulated photo of Mr. Trump showed him looking to the ceiling during a performance. \u201cThe slow humming of Chinese opera doesn\u2019t seem to suit Trump\u2019s temperament,\u201d read the caption. \u201cTrump looked like he was about to fall asleep.\u201dChina\u2019s army of censors went into overdrive as interest in Mr. Trump surged during his visit.Censors prevented internet users from commenting on several reports about Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. Officials deleted posts that touched on topics the government deems sensitive, including North Korea and how Mr. Trump was able to evade China\u2019s firewall and use Twitter. Twitter, like Facebook, is banned in the country.Perhaps most striking was the removal of at least two items, written by the United States Embassy in Beijing, and posted to Weibo, a state-controlled microblogging platform.One deleted post quoted Mr. Trump, in a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, saying \u201cthe era of strategic patience is over\u201d when it came to dealing with North Korea, an ally of China.The government also did not broadcast live a joint news conference between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi on domestic channels on Thursday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bridal Shop Just Closed. How to Rescue the Day.", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byField NotesWhat do you do if your bridal store or the designer of your gown goes out of business before the dress is delivered?Even though the Angelo closure affected so many, it isn\u2019t uncommon for smaller local shops to close, too, leaving brides feeling stranded, said Madeline Gardner, the designer for Morilee. But, she said, there is hope because there are many stores that sell the same or similar dresses and finding a new one is not that difficult.Here\u2019s how you can ease the panic as you prepare for your wedding day and you are suddenly without a dress.The beginning of helping yourself recover is to never give a deposit in cash or write a check. Never. When a dress is ordered, a customer usually pays a deposit of 50 percent; always put it on a credit card so the payment can be disputed in case the store closes before delivering the goods.Connie Gable, the vice president of customer relations for Maggie Sottero, a manufacturer of wedding dresses said, \u201cYou will never get your deposit back if you paid in cash. Nobody will give cash back.\u201dBut credit card companies will usually return money on a credit card. And always save the deposit receipt. It is likely to come in handy and save you money as you begin your search for another dress.When you choose and order your dress, make sure to note the name on the label.Social media can then play a big role in quickly finding another dress. Join Facebook and other social media groups of women and stores that are created specifically to help. Go to those sites and search for your particular designer and dress.For example: the Facebook group for Alfred Angelo Disney dresses has women searching for gowns as well as some who have dresses to sell; one woman is looking for a dress No. 2506 in size 6; another is selling her dress No. c254 in size 16.One bride was able to find an Alfred Angelo flower girl dress from someone in Britain on Facebook. It was a perfect match to the one she had ordered in Florida. She bought the new one using a credit card and had it sent to her via FedEx.Look for other stores that sold the brand you ordered and call them.Go to the company site and use the store locator to find stores.If they have pieces from their stock that can replace your dress, they will ship them. Sometimes a store will have the same dress but in ivory, for example, rather than the white you originally ordered; buy it in another color if it\u2019s your dream dress. Remember: Larger sizes can be altered down so, ask not only about your size, but also the ones near yours.Renee Jon, a dressmaker who alters wedding dresses and makes custom designs, works out of her home in Chino Hills, Calif. She helped during the recent Alfred Angelo closing. \u201cIf a bride had a receipt for a deposit from Angelo and found a dress in my inventory, I gave her an extra discount,\u201d Ms. Jon said.Many others will do the same.The manager of a store can give you the name of the wholesale sales representative the store works with for the dress you are looking for. Ask the wholesale rep to help locate the dress you want. The wholesaler may have recently shipped inventory to stores not on your radar.Misty Cushing, a bride-to-be in Las Vegas, had ordered a dress last summer in Ohio (where her family lives) for her March 2018 wedding. She lost the dress in the Alfred Angelo closure but did get her deposit back. She then bought a similar dress by a different manufacturer (Morilee) at a store in Las Vegas.\u201cThe entire bridal industry stepped up,\u201d she said. \u201cThe original store credited my deposit back to my credit card; I had a photo of the dress with me to show the store in Las Vegas. They found a Morilee dress that almost matched my original choice. The bridal shops really try to make brides happy. It\u2019s an art that\u2019s been lost on our society.\u201dMorilee sold her the wedding dress at a 20 percent discount because she had her deposit receipt. And, Mitchel Udell, an owner of Morilee said even though there is usually a rush charge for a bride who needs her dress quickly, \u201cwe waived the rush charge for anyone caught in the closing.\u201dJillian Forsberg is the sales manager at the Dress Gallery, a 6,000-square-foot store in Wichita, Kan., that dresses 1,500 brides a year. \u201cWe\u2019ve had other designers go out of business but never anything on the scale of the Alfred Angelo closing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still had some Angelo dresses in our stock and we were able to sell the exact ones to about five girls who contacted us from all over the country.\u201d They sold them at wholesale if a deposit receipt was shown.Once the designer goes out of business, the samples already in stores are of no use, she explained, since these dresses have been tried on and are not new. The Dress Gallery shipped dresses all over the country to people who could use such samples, she said.Advertisement"}

Amazon officials opened an investigation, and Jill Soloway, the creator of \u201cTransparent,\u201d said she and others on the show were cooperating with it.Soon after, the actress Trace Lysette came forward publicly, saying that Mr. Tambor had \u201cmade many sexual advances and comments\u201d and, on one occasion, physically assaulted her between takes for a scene in which both actors were wearing pajamas.At the time, Ms. Lysette said, she laughed and brushed off the episode \u2014 because Mr. Tambor was the star of the show and she had to work with him, and because she was accustomed to such mistreatment. \u201cGiven the journey and circumstances of my life, I was used to being treated as a sexual object by men,\u201d wrote Ms. Lysette, who is a transgender woman. \u201cThis one just happened to be famous.\u201d\u201cI know I haven\u2019t always been the easiest person to work with,\u201d he said. \u201cI can be volatile and ill-tempered, and too often I express my opinions harshly and without tact.

{"Headline": "In Air Force, Colleague Feared Church Gunman Would \u2018Shoot Up the Place\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the start of his Air Force career, Devin P. Kelley was picked for a demanding and selective intelligence analyst school. He walked into his first Monday of class with a crisp blue uniform, shined shoes, and for perhaps the first time in years, with hope. It didn\u2019t last.Two years later, he found himself on the run, in a bleak El Paso bus station at midnight trying to catch the first Greyhound back home after failing out of school, being charged with assault and escaping from a psychiatric hospital.As he waited in jean shorts and a hooded sweatshirt, the ticket in his hand was proof he had once again failed.For Mr. Kelley, who last Sunday opened fire on a rural Texas church, killing 26 people, the Air Force could have been a turning point \u2014 a source of discipline and direction that he had not embraced in a troubled childhood. But military records and interviews with fellow airmen show that despite repeated chances, his career fell apart under the weight of his depression and rage, at a time when his mind was churning with half-laid plans to kill his superiors.After only a few months in the service, Mr. Kelley slid back into a long decline that left a wreckage of broken relationships, criminal convictions and eventually bloodshed.\u201cThe Air Force tried to give him chances but he was just problem after problem after problem,\u201d said Jessika Edwards, a former Air Force staff sergeant who worked with Mr. Kelley in 2011, near the end of his career.\u201cHe was a dude on the edge,\u201d Ms. Edwards added, noting that he would appear at informal squadron social functions in all black and a black trench coat. \u201cThis is not just in hindsight. He scared me at the time.\u201dEven after he left the military, he contacted her on Facebook with disturbing posts about his obsession with Dylann S. Roof, the Charleston, S.C., mass murderer, and his target practices using dogs ordered online.Ms. Edwards said the military had tried counseling and tough love, but nothing seemed to work. When punished for poor performance, Mr. Kelley would cry, scream and shake with rage, vowing to kill his superiors, she recalled. His temper was so unsettling that she warned others in the squadron to go easy on him or he was likely to come back and \u201cshoot up the place.\u201dThe Air Force, like the civilian world, is often ill-equipped to intervene before violence occurs. Though Mr. Kelley\u2019s behavior raised flags, commanders say they have limited options until a crime is committed. Even then, the priority is more often on getting problem troops out of the military, giving little thought to the possible impact on society. After facing intense criticism for its failure to report Mr. Kelley, the Air Force has opened an investigation into the case and many questions remain about what more it could have done.The Air Force offered him a clean slate and the chance to prove himself. He enlisted right after high school in 2009. Based on above-average aptitude test scores, he was picked to become a fusion analyst \u2014 an intelligence specialist trained to interpret and communicate the latest information on enemy tactics. It promised a clear career path and a top-secret clearance.In spring 2010, after two months of basic training, he arrived at Goodfellow Air Force Base near San Angelo, Tex., for the rigorous six-month intelligence technical school. Graduating required passing a polygraph test and a background check to get a security clearance.Mr. Kelley washed out before graduation.The Air Force did not provide details on whether Mr. Kelley passed the required polygraph, which typically scrutinizes mental health, drug use, family issues and disruptive behavior. A military official briefed on Mr. Kelley\u2019s Air Force record said only that he was cut from the school for \u201cacademic reasons.\u201dSeveral airmen who went through school with Mr. Kelley said in a closed Facebook group viewed by The New York Times that he did not last long. Some remembered him being there only a few weeks.\u201cI didn\u2019t even realize he was in for as long as he was,\u201d one of them said. \u201cI thought he was discharged in tech school, let alone retrained into a different career field.\u201dMr. Kelley\u2019s next assignment was decidedly less demanding. Records show the Air Force made him a traffic management apprentice, a job that includes moving people and freight, and requires a minimal aptitude score. Still, he struggled.He was sent in 2011 to Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico and assigned to the 49th Logistics Readiness Squadron. Six days before he arrived, he had married 19-year-old Tessa Loge from his hometown \u2014 a move that allowed his new wife and her baby from another relationship to move into base housing with him, and gave him increased pay because he had dependents.At the base, Mr. Kelley worked in the receiving department, entering information on incoming supplies into a computer. He was smart enough, said Ms. Edwards, who worked in the same office, but he and his new wife fought constantly and were being investigated by local child protective services for child abuse. His wife, who later divorced him, declined to comment.Mr. Kelley was so emotionally unstable and unfocused, Ms. Edwards said, that he often would not do his work.As punishment, superiors would give Mr. Kelley menial tasks, such as mopping or scrubbing toilets, which would send him into a rage, Ms. Edwards said. \u201cHe would get so upset,\u201d she said, \u201cand just keep saying, \u2018I want to kill them.\u2019\u201dHe was formally disciplined multiple times, she said, including for sneaking a gun onto the base in his car.The Air Force confirmed that Ms. Edwards served in the same squadron as Mr. Kelley, and that evaluations show he performed poorly.His wife filed for divorce that year.On the night of June 7, 2012, Mr. Kelley escaped, made his way 12 miles south in the desert night to the El Paso bus station and bought a ticket home.His counselor at the hospital called the police, according to a police report, warning that Mr. Kelley had talked about killing his chain of command in the Air Force and told other patients he had recently bought guns online.Mr. Kelley was quickly caught and kept in pretrial confinement before his court-martial because his commanders were concerned about the threats, said Don Christensen, a retired colonel who at the time was the Air Force\u2019s chief prosecutor. He pleaded guilty to two counts of assault and in November 2012 was sentenced to 12 months in confinement \u2014 a relatively light sentence.\u201cA serious injury to a child is worth more than a year in confinement,\u201d said Mr. Christensen, who is now president of Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence in the military.Mr. Christensen said that during his military career he had seen service members receive the same punishment Mr. Kelley got for merely abusing over-the-counter cough medicine.Air Force officials apologized last week after admitting that in recent years an unknown number of violent criminals were never registered with the system. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all of our databases,\u201d the Air Force secretary, Heather Wilson, said.After his guilty plea, Mr. Kelley served just eight months in military prison. In June 2013 he was let out, having been knocked down to the lowest possible rank and given a bad conduct discharge that barred him from nearly all veterans benefits, including mental health treatment.He went back to New Braunfels. Though his parents owned a sprawling ranch house with a patio and pool, he moved into their barn. He married again in 2014, to 19-year-old Danielle Shields.\u201cThat\u2019s where things started to get weird,\u201d said Ms. Edwards, who reconnected with Mr. Kelley around that time when he called asking for a job reference. They started chatting occasionally on Facebook, she said, and his posts grew gradually more disturbing until she finally stopped communicating with him this year.At first, Mr. Kelley shared photos of his children and small updates, she said. Then he started complaining about his new wife, and about how his family was trying to get him to take medication. He said he hated his wife, but feared she would leave and take the children, Ms. Edwards said.Law enforcement officials said their rocky relationship may have contributed to the shooting on Sunday.A friend of Mr. Kelley\u2019s mother-in-law, Todd Feltner, said on Friday that the marriage was strained because \u201cDevin was abusing her physically, verbally and mentally.\u201d He added that the mother-in-law told him that Mr. Kelley had threatened her family, too: \u201cHe was telling her \u2018that he was going to get them.\u2019\u201d\u201cHe was excited about it. He went on and on and on about it, saying \u2018Isn\u2019t it cool? Isn\u2019t it cool?\u2019 Have you watched the videos?\u2019\u201d Ms. Edwards said. She said she told Mr. Kelley that he was not acting normal and needed help.\u201cHe told me he would never have the nerve to kill people, he only killed animals,\u201d she said.In 2016 he sent her photos of a new military-style rifle he was building, one that she said looked like the rifle the authorities said he used in the church shooting.This spring, Mr. Kelley\u2019s comments became so disturbing that she unfriended him \u2014 something a number of his other friends also said they did.The breaking point came when he told her he was buying dogs online and using them as target practice. \u201cI told him this was not normal, and he needed the kind of help I could not give him,\u201d Ms. Edwards said. \u201cBefore I unfriended him, I gave him my number. I told him, \u2018If you ever are thinking about hurting yourself or someone else, just call.\u2019\u201dHe never called.Now she, like many others in his path, says she cannot help but blame herself for not acting when she saw signs of trouble.On Sunday, she was washing dishes at home when another member of their old squadron texted her. \u201cThe shooter, it\u2019s Kelley,\u201d the text said.She dropped the glass in her hands and started crying.Doris Burke and Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Is Happening on Manus Island? The Detainee Crisis Explained", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United Nations warned on Thursday of an \u201cunfolding humanitarian emergency\u201d in Papua New Guinea, as hundreds of asylum seekers barricaded themselves inside an abandoned detention center on Manus Island, choosing to remain inside a camp devoid of food and clean water rather than relocate to alternative facilities in a city nearby.The camp officially closed on Tuesday, but the detainees have refused to relocate to temporary accommodations, claiming fears of violent reprisals by the island\u2019s residents.By law, Australia will not resettle any migrants who approach the country by boat, a policy intended to discourage dangerous ocean crossings and human smuggling. Since 2013, Australia has paid Papua New Guinea, its closest neighbor, to house hundreds of migrants caught at sea while trying to reach the continent.About 600 migrants, all men, and mostly from the Middle East and Southeast Asia, remain at the center. Most of them have sought status as refugees or asylum seekers.Many of the men have already had their asylum claims vetted and approved by the United States and are awaiting placement there, according to American officials. But nearly 200 have been rejected, leaving them in legal limbo.Tensions over the migrants have grown since the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea agreed in April to close the site by Oct. 31.On Tuesday, water and electricity to the camp were shut off, and detainees were supposed to move to temporary housing in Lorengau, a city close by on the island.\u201cIt\u2019s very surprising to see it come to this level,\u201d said Jonathan Pryke, Pacific Islands program director for the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. \u201cIt just seems like a complete mess.\u201dBy Thursday, conditions in the camp appeared to have declined.One detainee, Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran, said the men were experiencing dehydration, hunger, anxiety and the fear of attack and disease.\u201cHeat, humidity, hunger and incessant mosquitoes are taking their toll,\u201d Mr. Boochani wrote on Facebook. \u201cThis is not a hunger strike. It is a situation that the Australian government has created, forcing people into starvation and these harsh conditions by refusing to offer a safe place for resettlement.\u201dBy Friday, detainees said conditions were leading to illness. One asylum seeker, Imran Mohammad, said in a text message that three diabetic men had fallen ill because they were unable to get insulin, and the camp was strewn with garbage.The governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea each claim the other is responsible for relocating the men until a permanent solution can be found.Australia has pledged 250 million Australian dollars, or $193 million, for the men\u2019s food and security at the facilities in Lorengau for the next year.Julie Bishop, Australia\u2019s foreign minister, said on Thursday that it made \u201cno sense\u201d for the detainees to remain at the camp. But Nat Jit Lam, the regional representative of the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency, said the temporary housing was incomplete and unsafe.\u201cI will not be bringing any refugee there to stay \u2014 not in that state,\u201d Mr. Lam told ABC Radio of Australia.In a statement issued Thursday, the agency said: \u201cAustralia remains responsible for the well-being of all those moved to Papua New Guinea until adequate, long-term solutions outside the country are found.\u201dAustralia has consistently said it will not accept the men for resettlement.They have all been given the option of permanent residency in Papua New Guinea, or applying to resettle in Cambodia or Nauru, the location of a second offshore facility run by the Australian government. None of the men still on Manus have accepted the offer, according to reports.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Can\u2019t Trust Facebook to Regulate Itself", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorI led Facebook\u2019s efforts to fix privacy problems on its developer platform in advance of its 2012 initial public offering. What I saw from the inside was a company that prioritized data collection from its users over protecting them from abuse. As the world contemplates what to do about Facebook in the wake of its role in Russia\u2019s election meddling, it must consider this history. Lawmakers shouldn\u2019t allow Facebook to regulate itself. Because it won\u2019t.Facebook knows what you look like, your location, who your friends are, your interests, if you\u2019re in a relationship or not, and what other pages you look at on the web. This data allows advertisers to target the more than one billion Facebook visitors a day. It\u2019s no wonder the company has ballooned in size to a $500 billion behemoth in the five years since its I.P.O.The more data it has on offer, the more value it creates for advertisers. That means it has no incentive to police the collection or use of that data \u2014 except when negative press or regulators are involved. Facebook is free to do almost whatever it wants with your personal information, and has no reason to put safeguards in place.For a few years, Facebook\u2019s developer platform hosted a thriving ecosystem of popular social games. Remember the age of Farmville and Candy Crush? The premise was simple: Users agreed to give game developers access to their data in exchange for free use of addictive games.Unfortunately for the users of these games, there were no protections around the data they were passed through Facebook to outside developers. Once data went to the developer of a game, there was not much Facebook could do about misuse except to call the developer in question and threaten to cut off the developer\u2019s access. As the I.P.O. approached, and the media reported on allegations of misuse of data, I, as manager of the team responsible for protecting users on the developer platform from abuse of their data, was given the task of solving the problem.In one instance, a developer appeared to be using Facebook data to automatically generate profiles of children, without their consent. When I called the company responsible for the app, it claimed that Facebook\u2019s policies on data use were not being violated, but we had no way to confirm whether that was true. Once data passed from the platform to a developer, Facebook had no view of the data or control over it. In other cases, developers asked for permission to get user data that their apps obviously didn\u2019t need \u2014 such as a social game asking for all of your photos and messages. People rarely read permissions request forms carefully, so they often authorize access to sensitive information without realizing it.At a company that was deeply concerned about protecting its users, this situation would have been met with a robust effort to cut off developers who were making questionable use of data. But when I was at Facebook, the typical reaction I recall looked like this: try to put any negative press coverage to bed as quickly as possible, with no sincere efforts to put safeguards in place or to identify and stop abusive developers. When I proposed a deeper audit of developers\u2019 use of Facebook\u2019s data, one executive asked me, \u201cDo you really want to see what you\u2019ll find?\u201dThe message was clear: The company just wanted negative stories to stop. It didn\u2019t really care how the data was used.When Russians decided to target Americans during the 2016 election, they didn\u2019t buy TV or newspaper ads, or hire a skywriter. They turned to Facebook, where their content reached at least 126 million Americans. The fact that Facebook prioritized data collection over user protection and regulatory compliance is precisely what made it so attractive. Now the company is arguing that it should be allowed to regulate itself to prevent this from happening again. My experience shows that it should not.Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, mentioned in an October interview with Axios that one of the ways the company uncovered Russian propaganda ads was by identifying that they had been purchased in rubles. Given how easy this was, it seems clear the discovery could have come much sooner than it did \u2014 a year after the election. But apparently Facebook took the same approach to this investigation as the one I observed during my tenure: react only when the press or regulators make something an issue, and avoid any changes that would hurt the business of collecting and selling data.This makes for a dangerous mix: a company that reaches most of the country every day and has the most detailed set of personal data ever assembled, but has no incentive to prevent abuse. Facebook needs to be regulated more tightly, or broken up so that no single entity controls all of its data. The company won\u2019t protect us by itself, and nothing less than our democracy is at stake.Sandy Parakilas worked as an operations manager on the platform team at Facebook in 2011 and 2012.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What New York Attack Suspect\u2019s Words May Say About ISIS Ties", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than two days after the driver of a pickup truck crushed pedestrians in a bike lane in Lower Manhattan, at least four clues have emerged showing the radicalization of the suspect, Sayfullo Saipov.While it remains unknown if the suspect was speaking to the terrorist group or being guided by it, pieces of paper and two cellphones at the scene provide a window into his familiarity with the terminology of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. (On Thursday night, the group took credit for the attack in its weekly newsletter.)You can even find it etched into the desks they used, like teenagers carving their initials on a picnic table.It means \u201cremaining\u201d or \u201cenduring,\u201d and it is the terrorist group\u2019s slogan, dating to when it was still an affiliate of Al Qaeda.A senior law enforcement official, who had been briefed on the investigation into the New York attack, said that the phrase appeared more than once in the note. \u201cThere\u2019s some stuff in the beginning and then there\u2019s the repeated, \u2018The Islamic State will endure forever,\u2019 or \u2018will last forever,\u2019 you know, three times, in Arabic,\u201d he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.The Islamic State\u2019s magazine, Rumiyah, provided detailed guidance on truck attacks in an issue published in November 2016. The group encouraged supporters to keep driving the car for as long as possible. \u201cTo ensure the most carnage over upon the enemies of Allah, it is imperative that one does not exit his vehicle during the attack. Rather, he should remain inside, driving over the already harvested kuffar\u201d \u2014 infidels \u2014 \u201cand continue crushing their remains until it becomes physically impossible to continue by vehicle.\u201dIn the New York attack, the suspect drove over people in the bike lane until he crashed into a school bus.According to the magazine, the attacker is expected to jump out and use a secondary weapon, like a gun or a knife. The New York attacker did just that: He jumped out with a pellet gun, though he did not appear to have hurt anyone with it. His aim, though, may have also been to use a knife. The complaint states that a black bag containing three knives was found near Mr. Saipov after he was shot.Among the more obscure instructions, however, is the manner in which the assailant is supposed to tell the public of his allegiance to the Islamic State. The article states that an assailant should write a note on several sheets of paper, throwing them out the window of the vehicle as the attack is being carried out. The magazine suggests including the phrase, \u201cThe Islamic State will remain,\u201d a rendering of the group\u2019s baqiya slogan.The New York attacker\u2019s papers were found about 10 feet from the driver\u2019s side of the car, the criminal complaint said.On the attacker\u2019s cellphone, recovered at the scene, investigators found several pictures of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-styled caliph of the Islamic State.Recruits learn that before an attack, a pledge of allegiance needs to be recorded. It can be written or recorded as audio or video, but the pledge is supposed to be to addressed to an individual, in this case the caliph of the Islamic State, and not to the organization overall.This ritual is meant to recreate the way in which early Muslims pledged fealty to the Prophet Muhammad, and later to the caliphs that succeeded him, said Amarnath Amarasingam, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Islamic State recruits refer to Mr. Baghdadi as Emir al-Mumineem, an honorific meaning the commander of the believers, and they will often use a long version of his name \u2014 \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Husseini al-Qurayshi.\u201dThe last term \u2014 al-Qurayshi \u2014 is a reference to tribe of the Prophet Muhammad. One of the rules for choosing a caliph is that he must be descended from the lineage of the prophet. Recruits who use this terminology are nodding to this history.Although Mr. Saipov had pictures of Mr. Baghdadi on his phone and told investigators that he began plotting his attack after hearing one of the leader\u2019s audio recordings, the authorities said, he does not appear to have pledged allegiance in this formal manner. This could reflect someone who was self-radicalized, not coached online, at least not extensively, by Islamic State recruiters.At the same time, what the complaint said was found on the attacker\u2019s phone suggests he may have had access to the Islamic State\u2019s secret chat rooms on the app Telegram. It is in these chat rooms, known as \u201cchannels,\u201d that Islamic State followers congregate and post claims for attacks as well as share videos, including executions.With numerous lawsuits filed against social media companies by the families of victims of recent Islamic State attacks, the group\u2019s videos are often suspended within hours of being uploaded to YouTube, Twitter or Facebook. The group has increasingly turned to closed channels to share information.Among the videos that investigators said they found on Mr. Saipov\u2019s phone was one of the group\u2019s most disturbing clips, showing the grotesque executions of prisoners forced to wear orange jumpsuits in an echo of the United States prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.That the suspect was said to have these videos, as well as thousands of images of Islamic State propaganda suggests he may have had access to the group\u2019s Telegram channels.These channels include online tutorials on how to carry out attacks. For example, the Lone Lions channel routinely posts step-by-step demonstrations showing how to make triacetone triperoxide, or TATP, the explosive compound used in nearly all Islamic State attacks in the West. More important, these channels serve as digital watering holes, where ISIS scouts identify potential new attackers.Numerous attacks in the last three years were carried out by recruits who made contact with Islamic State handlers on the Telegram app, and later migrated to encrypted, one-on-one chats.Like any other app, Telegram can be deleted from a phone. The complaint does not state if investigators found the app on the two cellphones the suspect left at the scene, or if he erased the digital bread crumbs leading back to ISIS.Al Baker contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

But Abid Omar\u2019s jaw still dropped on Wednesday, when he checked the air-quality monitor he had installed to track the city\u2019s appalling pollution.It said that levels of the dangerous particulates known as PM2.5, small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, had reached 1,077 micrograms per cubic meter \u2014 more than 30 times what Pakistan\u2019s government considers the safe limit.\u201cYou can see and smell the smoke all day; you can actually touch the filth,\u201d said Amna Manan, a 26-year-old manager for a multinational company in Lahore, a city of 11 million. \u201cHalf the time, I\u2019m scared to breathe in.\u201dNaseem-ur-Rehman, a director at Punjab\u2019s Environment Protection Department, admitted that the government had bought six air-quality monitors last year but never installed them \u2014 until last week, when a public outcry over the lack of data led to a scramble to set them up across Lahore. He said the department was \u201cclosely monitoring the situation,\u201d but as of Thursday it was still not releasing air-quality numbers.\u201cThis is a crisis of data,\u201d said Ahmad Rafay Alam, an environmental lawyer and activist in Lahore. He said six meters were insufficient for a city the size of Lahore, let alone for all of Punjab.Mr. Omar\u2019s Twitter updates have prompted many of Lahore\u2019s middle- and upper-class residents to buy air purifiers and don face masks.\u201cThe political will is missing on the government side,\u201d Ms. Raja said. \u201cWe the public need to act as a pressure group, as a watchdog, to make sure that they do something effective.\u201dThe throat-burning, eye-stinging smoke plaguing Punjab has created problems beyond the obvious health concerns. On Tuesday alone, at least a dozen people were killed in road accidents linked to poor visibility in Lahore, according to the police. Major highways have been intermittently closed because of the visibility problems.Thirteen power plants that run on fuel oil have been shut down since last weekend, and power generation has been cut back at four others, leading to daily outages of more than 12 hours in many urban areas. At one Lahore hospital alone, more than 500 people have been arriving daily with complaints of respiratory difficulties and eye irritation.\u201cLahore looks like a dystopian wasteland right now, kind of like a scene from \u2018Blade Runner,\u2019\u201d said Adil Ghazi, a business owner.But environmentalists say a real solution would require much more serious measures: improving fuel quality, phasing out fuel-guzzling cars, introducing solar and other renewable sources of energy, planting trees on a large scale and improving public transportation to reduce the number of cars on the roads.\u201cThere is a lot of media interest in the story and public anger right now, so emergency measures are being taken, but a long-term solution doesn\u2019t seem to be a priority,\u201d Mr. Alam said. \u201cThe sense of urgency has to be sustained.\u201dMost important, he said, the government needs to stop looking for others to blame, including India, whose crop fires Pakistani environmental officials have blamed for the worsening smog this year.\u201cNo doubt smoke from crop burning in India is a big problem, but let\u2019s not pretend we don\u2019t have our own part to play in this crisis,\u201d Mr. Omar said. \u201cThe government needs to acknowledge the problem and create awareness.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then they crushed and left those who aspire to join the middle class behind.\u201dFor months, the race to replace Mr. Christie, a Republican, has flown largely under the radar of national politics, despite being one of only two governor\u2019s races in the country. Mr. Murphy marched through the primary and has held onto an early lead, while Ms. Guadagno has been unable to escape the shadow of the unpopular Mr. Christie, whom she has served with for nearly eight years.But Ms. Guadagno\u2019s campaign garnered headlines when she seized on Mr. Murphy\u2019s pledge in the first debate to make New Jersey a \u201csanctuary state,\u201d in opposition to President Trump\u2019s immigration policies, and aired a controversial ad that inaccurately portrayed Mr. Murphy as a protector of violent criminals, twisting his statement to protect undocumented immigrants. The issue \u2014 absent for the first seven months of her campaign \u2014 became an energizing force for the Republican base.As Ms. Guadagno transitioned from taxes to \u201cmaking New Jersey safer\u201d at a rally in Flemington on Sunday, her mere mention of \u201csanctuary state\u201d drew the largest reaction from the volunteers there.It is a tactic Mr. Murphy has repeatedly found both unfair and distasteful.\u201cThey\u2019re throwing mud, rocks, making stuff up, come on,\u201d he told the crowd in Parsippany, his voice escalating with each syllable. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to scare people to vote for them. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201dThe 2016 presidential election has loomed over this election. Ms. Guadagno, aside from her immigration policies that align with Mr. Trump\u2019s, has largely ignored any mention of the president. But Mr. Murphy and his allies routinely point to the election as a rallying cry.\u201cEverywhere I went, people asked me, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen in New Jersey?\u201d said Senator Cory A. Booker, a Democrat who campaigned with Mr. Murphy on Saturday. \u201cYou know why? Because they don\u2019t have the privilege of getting to be the first state to respond to the hate. That can respond to the darkness. That can respond to the demeaning tweets with greatest power one has in a democracy, the power to vote.\u201dA few hundred supporters who gathered in the chilly parking lot outside of a Murphy campaign field office shared Mr. Booker\u2019s excitement and confidence.Teresa Cinnamond, a \u201clifelong Democrat\u201d from Mountain Lakes, had no doubt: \u201cOne hundred percent he wins.\u201d Her son, Will, a senior at Mountain Lakes High School, was equally confident. And he liked the change he thought Mr. Murphy could bring.\u201cHe has a very unique voice that he kind of speaks for a lot of the people who are very unhappy about Chris Christie and all the things he did, how he acted kind of like a bully,\u201d he said. \u201cI see Phil Murphy more of a friend of the people.\u201dWhile the crowds packed in to see Mr. Murphy and Mr. Booker, many of the gatherings Ms. Guadagno held on her four-day bus tour across the state were sparsely attended. Nonetheless, she projected confidence.\u201cThe momentum is going our way, I\u2019ve seen these rooms get fuller and fuller today,\u201d she said at a campaign stop here on Sunday.As Ms. Guadagno made her way back to her bus after the event, she was stopped by two familiar faces.\u201cKim!\u201d Megan Yaede shouted. Ms. Guadagno smiled and stopped for a hug. Ms. Yaede\u2019s sister Kelly Yaede is the mayor of Hamilton Township. They exchanged hugs and hellos before departing, as Ms. Yaede went to post pictures of the encounter on Facebook.\u201cWe support her 100 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many things that she has to give to us as New Jerseyans.\u201d\u201cAnd she\u2019s not Chris Christie,\u201d another of her sisters, Barb Yaede, chimed in.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia-Financed Ad Linked Clinton and Satan", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRussia-linked actors created accounts with names like Blacktivists and Back the Badge aimed at voters concerned about police relations with their communities, and other accounts that called for secure borders that were aimed at immigration hard-liners. One account, Army of Jesus, published an illustration of an arm-wrestling match between Christ and the devil. \u201cSatan: If I win, Clinton wins!\u201d the headline read.The sampling of ads, some of which had been made public earlier, came during a second day of hearings with the top lawyers for Facebook, Twitter and Google and were intended to show the executives how pervasively Russia used their platforms to further its campaign of misinformation. Lawmakers of both parties expressed frustration with answers that fell short of what they had hoped and insisted that the companies, long the darlings of American technology, do better.\u201cI must say, I don\u2019t think you get it,\u201d said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who was also at the first hearing a day earlier. \u201cI went home last night with profound disappointment. I asked specific questions, I got vague answers.\u201dFacebook, Google and Twitter said their general counsels were best equipped to dive into policy and legal questions. But counsels\u2019 appearances on Capitol Hill also allowed the companies\u2019 chief executives to escape high-profile scrutiny.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that you\u2019re here, and not your C.E.O.s,\u201d said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine.Lawmakers also complained that the companies had taken months to acknowledge Russia\u2019s interference on their sites.Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, spent Wednesday at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., talking to investors and analysts as they reported blockbuster quarterly earnings. The stocks of both Google and Facebook, which faced the most criticism in the hearings, are at record highs.During the earnings call, Mr. Zuckerberg was unequivocal in his stance on the issue of Russian meddling in the election.\u201cI\u2019ve expressed how upset I am that the Russians used our tools to sow mistrust,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said, noting that Facebook\u2019s profits will probably be affected by the amount of money the company will spend fighting abuse of its platform. Facebook said it plans to double the number of content reviewers it employs, to 20,000, and will try to add a greater degree of transparency into its advertising system.\u201cWhat they did is wrong, and we\u2019re not going to stand for it,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.The tech companies also provided new numbers on the reach of Russia\u2019s influence campaign. Facebook said an estimated 150 million users of its main site and its subsidiary, Instagram, were exposed to the posts, a larger figure than it provided even as recently as Monday.During the last of the three hearings, members of the House Intelligence Committee spoke in front of posters displaying the content, complaining that it was divisive.Representative Andr\u00e9 Carson, Democrat of Indiana, said an account called Being Patriotic, which amassed 200,000 followers, pushed out content that \u201ccynically exploits grieving officers and their loved ones in order to pit Americans concerned about our law enforcement personnel against Americans concerned about African-American lives lost during police encounters.\u201dThe account was created by the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency.\u201cMy concern is that a dictator like Vladimir Putin abused flaws in our social media platforms to inject the worst kind of identity politics into the voting decisions of at least 100 million Americans,\u201d Mr. Carson said, referring to the Russian president.Ms. Sewell cited figures showing few blacks in Facebook\u2019s work force and its leadership \u2014 a lack of diversity that she said made it hard to believe that those reviewing socially divisive ads could spot problematic posts.While the lawyers showed humility and promised to beef up security and improve technology to prevent foreign interference in elections, they admitted they could not guarantee they would prevent future intrusions. Google\u2019s general counsel, Kent Walker, said the company would work on creating new technologies to detect foreign actors and misinformation on its site. All three said they would build artificial intelligence tools to combat fake and problematic content.\u201cA lot of folks, including many in the media, have tried to reduce this entire conversation down to one premise: Foreign actors conducted a surgically executed covert operation to help elect a United States president,\u201d said Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, emphasized that the real intent of Russian propaganda was to broadly spread misinformation and create chaos.\u201cThese operations \u2014 while we\u2019re talking about the 2016 presidential race \u2014 they\u2019re not limited to 2016, and they were not limited to the presidential race, and they continue to this day,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are much more widespread than one election.\u201dBut the difference in their emphasis on Wednesday also underscored the political realities buffeting their work. In advancing an investigation tied to Mr. Trump, Mr. Burr has been careful to make clear that the committee\u2019s work is larger than an individual candidate, and he has repeatedly tried to tamp down expectations about what it might find.Democrats did not have such reticence.\u201cWhether the Russians and the campaign coordinated these efforts, we do not yet know, but it is true that the Russians mounted what could be described as an independent expenditure campaign on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, also took aim at Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissal of the role of Russia-linked social media in his win. Mr. Heinrich challenged Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, to acknowledge such content and the role that fake accounts linked to Russia and other misinformation had in the election.Mr. Stretch said no. \u201cThe existence of those ads were on Facebook,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was not a hoax.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Middle-Class Families Confront Soaring Health Insurance Costs", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2014 Consumers here at first did not believe the health insurance premiums they saw when they went shopping for coverage this month on HealthCare.gov. Only five plans were available, and for a family of four with parents in their mid-30s, the cheapest plan went typically for more than $2,400 a month, nearly $30,000 a year.With the deadline for a decision less than a month away, consumers are desperately weighing their options, dismayed at the choices they have under the Affordable Care Act and convinced that political forces in Washington are toying with their health and well-being.\u201cI believe in the Affordable Care Act; it worked for me under the Obama administration,\u201d said Sara Stovall, 40, who does customer-support work for a small software company. \u201cBut it\u2019s not working as it was supposed to. It\u2019s being sabotaged, and I feel like a pawn.\u201dMs. Stovall said she might try to reduce her hours and income, so her family could qualify for subsidies on offer to poorer families to help pay for premiums.Heather Griffith, a 42-year-old real estate broker, said she would put aside much less money for her retirement and the education of her two young children so she could pay the premiums.And even though he does not need an assistant for his work as a developer of mobile apps, Ian Dixon, 38, said he might hire an employee just so he could buy health insurance as a small business, at a cost far below what he and his family would have to pay on their own.\u201cIf one word captures all this, it\u2019s \u2018helpless,\u201d\u2019 Mr. Dixon said. \u201cThere\u2019s rage and anger and all that stuff in there, too. Any reasonable person would agree that this should not be happening. And there\u2019s no one to go talk to about it. There\u2019s no hope that this is going to get fixed.\u201dThe situation here in Charlottesville is an extreme example of a pattern that can be seen in other places around the country. The Affordable Care Act is working fairly well for people who receive subsidies in the form of tax credits, said Doug Gray, the executive director of the Virginia Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers. But for many others, especially many middle-class families, he said, \u201cthe premium is outrageous, and it\u2019s unaffordable.\u201dCongress\u2019s repeated efforts to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law have rattled insurance markets. Actions by President Trump and his administration have added still more uncertainty. Now, Senate Republicans have attached a provision to their $1.5 trillion tax cut that would repeal the health law\u2019s mandate that most Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty.All of those actions \u2014 along with flaws in the law itself \u2014 are having real-world impact.\u201cWe share their pain,\u201d Michael M. Dudley, the president and chief executive of Optima Health, said of his Virginia customers now shopping for policies on the health law\u2019s online exchange. \u201cThe rate increases are very high. We can\u2019t minimize that because it\u2019s a fact.\u201dThe Dixon family, which includes two girls ages 1 and 3, has been paying $988 a month this year for insurance provided by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. But Anthem plans will not be available in Charlottesville next year. The company told customers that uncertainty in the insurance market \u201cdoes not provide the clarity and confidence we need to offer affordable coverage to our members.\u201dThe online federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, recommended another plan for Mr. Dixon in 2018. The new plan, offered by Optima Health, has premiums of $3,158 a month \u2014 about $37,900 a year \u2014 and an annual deductible of $9,200.Alternatively, Mr. Dixon could pick a lower-cost plan offered by Optima with premiums of about $2,500 a month, or $30,000 a year. But the deductible would be much higher. The Dixons would need to spend $14,400 a year for certain health care services before Optima would begin to pay.The Stovalls are facing similar mathematics.\u201cOur premiums will triple to $3,000 a month, with a $12,000 deductible, and that is far, far out of reach for us,\u201d Ms. Stovall said after researching the options for her family of four on HealthCare.gov. \u201cWe are not asking for free health insurance. All we want is a reasonable chance to buy it.\u201dSubsidies are available to help low- and moderate-income people pay premiums, but no financial assistance is available to a family of four with annual income over $98,400.\u201cAt an average of $60 per visit,\u201d Mr. Stanford said, \u201cI could visit the doctor\u2019s office 45 times a month for the premium that I\u2019m paying. I think we will probably drop our insurance and get a gap policy.\u201d Such short-term insurance is meant to fill temporary gaps, but typically does not cover maternity care or treatment for pre-existing medical conditions.And in the Charlottesville area, Mr. Dudley said, costs are high because many people receive care from an expensive academic medical center at the University of Virginia.Carolyn L. Engelhard, director of the health policy program at the university\u2019s School of Medicine, acknowledged that teaching hospitals often charged more. But another factor, she said, is that Virginia has not regulated insurance rates as aggressively as some other states.The Times would like to hear from Americans who are signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.Consumers are feeling the effects.\u201cObamacare helped me,\u201d Ms. Griffith said. \u201cI had a pre-existing condition, could not get insurance and had to pay cash, nearly $30,000, for the birth of my first baby in 2010. For my second pregnancy in 2015, I was covered by Obamacare, and that was a huge financial relief.\u201dBut the costs for next year, she said, are mind-boggling.She and her husband, both self-employed, expect to pay premiums of $32,000 a year for the cheapest Optima plan available to their family in 2018. That is two and a half times what they now pay Anthem. And the annual deductible, $14,400, will be four times as high.\u201cI have no choice,\u201d Ms. Griffith said. \u201cI agree that we need to make changes in the Affordable Care Act, but we don\u2019t have time to start over from scratch. We are suffering now.\u201dJill A. Hanken, a health lawyer at the Virginia Poverty Law Center, said, \u201cPeople who qualify for premium tax credits are finding very affordable plans with low premiums, and those consumers are quite pleased.\u201d But she added: \u201cFor people who don\u2019t qualify for tax credits, the cost of plans has truly skyrocketed. They can\u2019t afford or don\u2019t want to pay the high premiums.\u201dWhen the Affordable Care Act was adopted in 2010, Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, who was then the House speaker, said the law would make it easier for people to switch jobs or start their own businesses because they would not have to worry about losing health insurance.\u201cWe see it as an entrepreneurial bill,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said, \u201ca bill that says to someone, if you want to be creative and be a musician or whatever, you can leave your work, focus on your talent, your skill, your passion, your aspirations because you will have health care.\u201dAnd for a few years, Mr. Dixon said, that idea was appealing. \u201cI would not be an entrepreneur if it were not for Obamacare,\u201d he said.With soaring premiums, that option is less attractive.\u201cWhen I saw the insurance prices for 2018, my initial instinct was to try and go back to my previous employer,\u201d Mr. Dixon said. \u201cBut that would just smell of desperation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018I Remember the Joy\u2019: Readers Reflect on Life Under Mugabe and Hopes for the Future", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom Our ReadersMr. Mugabe, 93, the world\u2019s oldest head of state, has been the country\u2019s leader since it declared its independence from Britain in 1980, and it seemed that his nearly 40-year rule was coming to an end.We heard from nearly 100 readers. Here is a selection of the responses, which have been edited for length and clarity.Readers who lived in Zimbabwe in or shortly after 1980 shared the optimism they had in the early days of independence.\u201cI grew up during a time of abundance. I was in elementary school in the mid-\u201980s and there was never a shortage of anything. My parents were middle class and afforded us the opportunity to go to good schools \u2026\u201cWe had stability. We adored our prime minister who became the president. We actually didn\u2019t concern ourselves much with politics because there was nothing to worry about in our minds. Life was good.\u201d\u201cThe early years of independence were a joy to witness. Economic improvement for all and, above all, the end of the humiliation experienced by blacks who had lived under the oppressive racist regime of the Ian Smith government. Yes, much changed, but all-in-all for the better for the majority of Zimbabweans.\u201d\u201cI remember the joy and atmosphere on April 18, 1980, as people poured out into the streets. We lived in Chitungwiza at that time, and I was just starting primary school. Then, soon after, the place was lovely!\u201dMany younger Zimbabweans, some of whom have lived only under Mr. Mugabe\u2019s presidency, shared that their experience was marked by increasing personal and financial hardship.\u201cUp to the time I was about 8, we had a really good life. I remember being able to buy presents from Miekles for Christmas, going to dinner sometimes at Steers and having friends and family over for braais on weekends. However, those memories are from early on, and they are few and not very detailed.\u201cWhat I remember more clearly is queuing for days on end waiting for petrol \u2014 my gran or mom sleeping in the car. I remember going to the shops with a bag full of bills just to buy a loaf of bread.\u201cI remember using the bond notes to play monopoly as 100 billion began to mean nothing and couldn\u2019t even buy a piece of candy. I remember countless friends immigrating and our lives becoming more focused on survival rather than living.\u201d\u201cI remember when my mother stopped buying Kellogg\u2019s Corn Flakes, I used to moan because the cheaper local brand Willards\u2019 version would get soggy quicker. Little did my young mind know that our inflation rate had set a new Guinness world record at the time \u2026 Zimbabweans are still performing minor miracles daily, to feed and shelter their families.\u201d\u201cI love Zimbabwe with all my heart, but I also have memories of how hard life was, especially in 2008. I was doing \u2018A\u2019 levels (form 5) at a mission school. I remember we closed school early in November that year because the hyperinflation was at its peak and the school did not have and could not afford maize meal to sustain us for the remaining month.\u201cThey only had enough food for exam classes \u2014 students writing national exams (forms 4 and 6). The rest of us had to go home. It is because of experiences like these that I have zero sympathy for Mugabe.\u201dSeveral readers explained the reasons they had for leaving Zimbabwe.\u201cIn 2000, the political and economic situation took a massive downturn. There was total economic collapse with hyperinflation, shortages of every basic commodity: water, power, etc. The situation got worse every day. We left Zimbabwe in 2011 and now live in Orlando, Florida.\u201d\u201cAt the start of my high school education, things started shifting \u2014 we got involved in other countries\u2019 affairs and we took on the Economic Structural Adjustment Program (ESAP). Things quickly started falling apart.\u201cLike many others, I left and went to study abroad, but came back in 2009 when things appeared to be turning around. I left again when the situation began to deteriorate again.\u201d\u201cIn 1976, rather than be conscripted into the army of the Rhodesian Front and its leader, Ian Smith, I fled the country. I refused to fight in an unjust war against my fellow black countrymen.\u201d\u201cI left Zimbabwe for South Africa in 1981 after becoming pregnant and deciding that I didn\u2019t want an uncertain, fear-filled future for my children. My mother had been badly beaten in her home by an intruder, and while she chose to stay I no longer felt safe living there.\u201dReaders shared their hopes for the future and what they thought a regime change could accomplish.\u201cI have many dreams and goals for our country: that political opposition is welcomed and encouraged, that girls have better access to education and the statistic of 1 in 3 girls married under the age of 18 disappears, that access to health care and sexual education is readily available \u2014 and the list goes on \u2026\u201cI am worried that this military takeover is not because of a genuine desire for democratic transition or because the time for change is really upon us, but because those in charge have suddenly felt their livelihoods threatened and thus have taken an internal party dispute to the streets.\u201d\u201cMy hope for the beautiful nation of Zimbabwe is a peaceful transition to a leadership that will truly govern with the people\u2019s best interests at heart; that there will be a restoration of freedoms, economic progress and hope.\u201d\u201cI long for a Zimbabwe where people can again shun bribes and ill-gotten gains and pride themselves on building homes, communities and businesses where hard work and honesty are rewarded.\u201d\u201cI do think Zimbabwe has the potential to be a forward-thinking, progressive and prosperous nation. We tend to be hard-working people who value education and the finer things in life. We love to laugh, and I am pretty sure up until this point there\u2019s been no regime change because we have such a good sense of the absurd.\u201cGiven the right political and economic context, I have no doubt we would have a booming agriculture and tourism sector and an exciting music, art and literary scene. We deserve a better government. We always have. I\u2019m not sure Mnangagwa will deliver that government. I guess we will wait and see (patience is another one of our national characteristics).\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 71.McDaniel Entertainment, which represented Mr. Buckmaster, announced the death. The cause was not given.\u201cHe helped make me the artist I am,\u201d Mr. John wrote on Twitter after the death, calling Mr. Buckmaster \u201ca revolutionary arranger\u201d who \u201ctook my songs and made them soar.\u201dPaul Buckmaster was born on June 13, 1946, in London. His father, John, was a British-born actor, and his mother, Ermengilda Maltese, who was Italian, was a concert pianist and a graduate of the Naples Conservatory of Music.He showed musical ability from a young age. His mother tutored him in piano and music theory and signed him up for cello lessons when he was 4. He won his first cello competition in the 5-and-6 age group at a youth music festival. He later studied cello in Italy, and at 17 he was awarded a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London. After his graduation, one of his former professors arranged for him to join the orchestra backing the pop singer Paul Jones, which led to a job playing with the Bee Gees on a tour of Germany.Soon after that he met Gus Dudgeon, a producer; Tony Hall, who would become a record executive and manager; and Tony Visconti, a producer and arranger. It was Mr. Hall who suggested that he try arranging and gave him some trial assignments. Mr. Hall and Mr. Dudgeon then introduced him to the still largely unknown David Bowie, gave him a demo tape of \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d and asked him to give it a shot.The introductions to Mr. John and other artists followed, and soon he was sought after by all sorts of stars as rock continued to push beyond the limitations of guitars and drums.He branched out into other genres and media as well. He worked with Miles Davis, most notably on the 1972 album \u201cOn the Corner.\u201d He wrote the score for Terry Gilliam\u2019s 1995 film \u201c12 Monkeys.\u201dHis orchestrations could help elevate an artist beyond his normal sound and audience, as they did for the country star Dwight Yoakam on his 1993 album \u201cThis Time.\u201d\u201c \u2018This Time\u2019 may be the recording that finally gets Dwight Yoakam banned in Nashville and dropped from the Grand Ole Opry, and leaves country music traditionalists screaming \u2018double-crosser,\u2019 \u201d Russ DeVault, a reviewer for The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, wrote.\u201cOne general rule is to hold back as much as possible,\u201d he said, \u201cto give the listener the chance to let the song grow and unfold, introducing new sonic elements, such as new instruments or sectional groupings. If you use everything from the beginning, you have nowhere to go.\u201dMr. Buckmaster is survived by a son, Banten; a brother, Adrian; and a sister, Rosemary.\u201cPaul seemed to identify the genetic code of a song,\u201d wrote Mr. Folds, who used his arrangements on several projects, \u201cand then add the thing that you didn\u2019t know was there before \u2014 that explained it all \u2014 as the last touch.\u201dSometimes, Mr. Folds said, Mr. Buckmaster\u2019s offerings were so expansive that they took some getting used to. He told the story of his 2005 song \u201cLanded,\u201d the first on which he used Mr. Buckmaster.\u201cHe\u2019d weighed in strong, almost intrusively, I thought,\u201d Mr. Folds wrote. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough time for what he\u2019d done to sink in, and with release date on our tails, I made the decision to leave the strings out. MISTAKE!\u201dOnce he\u2019d had time to absorb Mr. Buckmaster\u2019s contribution, Mr. Folds said, he made sure that subsequent versions of the song included the strings.\u201cFrom that point on, when I had the treat of getting to work with Paul, I made space for him,\u201d Mr. Folds wrote, adding: \u201cAnd it was worth it each time. By the time I got to feature him on \u2018Lonely Avenue\u2019 with Nick Hornby, I left him a five-lane highway of space in which to work. He didn\u2019t disappoint.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He has never kissed a woman.Now, Mr. Zhang is ready for love \u2014 but like many men in China, he doesn\u2019t know where to begin.So Mr. Zhang turned to a dating coach. The \u201cFall in Love Emotional Education\u201d school, which caters to straight men, has taught him how to groom himself, approach a woman and flirt his way into her smartphone contacts.\u201cThere are many people who lack the ability to have a relationship,\u201d said Mr. Zhang, who enrolled in a three-day course during a weeklong holiday in October. \u201cMany times, it\u2019s not that there\u2019s something wrong with us. It\u2019s that we don\u2019t know what details to pay attention to.\u201d\u201cThey are caught in a very difficult situation, especially for those with no money,\u201d said Li Yinhe, a prominent scholar of sexuality in China.China worries about its lonely hearts. Newspapers warn that a surplus of unhappy, single men in China could lead to an increase in human trafficking, sex crimes and social instability. So the government is playing matchmaker.Marriage was utilitarian, done so people could start a family. Even when the notion of \u201cfreedom to love\u201d became popular after 1950, there were few social venues for people to snuggle and mingle. Until the late 1990s, sex outside marriage was illegal.Mr. Zhang\u2019s dating coach, Zhang Mindong, said he was once like the men he teaches. A self-professed loser, or \u201cdiaosi,\u201d Zhang Mindong said he suffered a painful breakup in 2012. He turned to the internet to find solutions and discovered the term \u201cpick-up artist.\u201dZhang Mindong started his school in the eastern city of Jinan in 2014, which he now runs with Cui Yihao, 25, and Fan Long, 29. Their services range from $45 for an online course to about $3,000 for one-on-one coaching. Similar schools have opened in several Chinese cities in recent years.The number of students who take offline courses at \u201cFall in Love Emotional Education\u201d has grown from one in 2014, to more than 300 now, according to Zhang Mindong. About 90 percent of graduates end up with girlfriends, he said.At the October session, there was Yu Ruitong, a 23-year-old software developer who had three previous relationships; Ye Chaoqun, a 27-year-old small business owner who is hoping to make the woman he likes fall in love with him; and James Zhang, a 30-year-old cancer doctor who is looking to expand the circle of women he knows. Both Mr. Ye and James Zhang have returned to polish what they learned earlier \u2014 this time free of charge.To show his students what they were up against, Zhang Mindong held up a profile of an attractive woman on a dating app that had garnered \u201clikes\u201d from 7,000 men. \u201cThis is the environment in China,\u201d he said.In the first hour, Zhang Mindong proclaimed them sartorial disasters. Most of the first day was devoted to improving dress. (\u201cNarrow collars, sleeves should be folded up above the elbow and trousers should be fitted.\u201d) They bought clothes and got haircuts.\u201cAfter getting into a relationship with a woman, many Chinese men let themselves go. They don\u2019t wash their hair, change their clothes and become really dirty,\u201d said Zhang Mindong, who was wearing hip glasses and a fitted white shirt.\u201cBut that\u2019s not the case for women, and this is why so many Chinese men can\u2019t have a long-term relationship.\u201dThe makeovers are followed by the students posing for photos \u2014 reading Stephen Hawking\u2019s \u201cA Brief History of Time,\u201d sipping tea and nibbling canap\u00e9s presented in a silver bird cage, looking pensively out a window. That culminated in selfies with Wang Zhen, a female friend of Mr. Cui\u2019s.Most social interactions in China usually start or end with people scanning each other\u2019s WeChat QR codes \u2014 a practice known as saoing \u2014 or adding each other\u2019s WeChat IDs. Many women form their impressions of men based on photographs on WeChat\u2019s \u201cMoments,\u201d a Facebook-like tool.On a Thursday night outside a busy shopping mall in Jinan, the students got their first challenge: approach women and ask for their WeChat contacts.\u201cYou give her two choices: \u2018Why don\u2019t you add me or I sao you?\u2019\u201d Zhang Mindong told the students. \u201cSo no matter what she picks, you\u2019ll succeed.\u201dAfter practicing their moves on Ms. Wang, the students set off. Zhang Zhenxiao rushed up to two women, who paused but continued walking. He chased after them and stopped them again. After a minute, they walked away.\u201cI didn\u2019t succeed,\u201d a dejected Mr. Zhang said, returning to the group.\u201cNo, the fact that you approached them means you did,\u201d Mr. Cui said, patting him on the back.By the end of the night, all the students had obtained at least one WeChat contact.The classes, held in an apartment on the grounds of Shandong University, have an air of brotherly camaraderie \u2014 the students, huddled together on a floral couch scribbling in notebooks, practiced real smiles and flirtatious banter with their coaches.A materials buyer for a renovations company, Zhang Zhenxiao said he had never learned how to talk to a woman. His high school forbade students from mixing with members of the opposite sex. His parents had an arranged marriage.Now, they are giving him pressure to settle down.

{"Headline": "Australia Is Responsible for Manus Island Refugees, U.N. Says", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 The authorities in Papua New Guinea have vowed to use force, if necessary, to remove hundreds of migrants and refugees protesting at a closed detention center on the remote Manus Island if the men have not left of their own accord by Saturday.Conditions have deteriorated in recent days for the nearly 600 men, mostly from the Middle East and Southeast Asia, who were sent to the island as part of Australia\u2019s offshore detention program. Some have been held there for years.United Nations experts on Thursday said that Australia was responsible for the developing humanitarian crisis, urging the government to move the men to safety in Australia and to end its policy of sending asylum seekers to offshore centers.The United Nations Human Rights Committee, a panel of independent experts, bluntly rejected Australia\u2019s position that it had no obligation toward the welfare of migrants it had sent to the center because they were not on Australian soil.Canberra had \u201ceffective control over this situation and as a result it has responsibility for the fate of these individuals,\u201d Yuval Shany, the panel\u2019s vice chairman, told reporters in Geneva.By law, Australia does not resettle any migrants who approach the country by boat, and since 2013 it has paid neighboring Papua New Guinea to shelter migrants trying to reach Australia. Most have already sought refugee status, and some are waiting for resettlement. Another 1,200 asylum seekers are being held in a center on the island of Nauru.Tensions increased on Thursday after Prime Minister Paul O\u2019Neill of Papua New Guinea threatened to use \u201cappropriate measures\u201d to clear the migrants from the center. A notice posted at the camp warned that remaining there would be detrimental to the men\u2019s health, and that if they were not out by Saturday, they could be forcibly removed or arrested.\u201cWe have shown peaceful resistance to send a message that we are not going to leave this prison camp for another prison camp and we don\u2019t want to live in P.N.G. where we are not safe,\u201d Mr. Boochani said, referring to Papua New Guinea, in a WhatsApp message also posted to his Facebook page. \u201cAustralia exiled us by force to this country and has kept us in this prison camp for nearly five years even though we have committed no crime. It has then abandoned us and it\u2019s obligated under international law to offer safe asylum.\u201dThe Papua New Guinea Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that the country\u2019s government was not required to provide the migrants with food, water or electricity, and its immigration minister, Petrus Thomas, said last month that the asylum seekers were Australia\u2019s responsibility.On Thursday she denounced the authorities\u2019 plan to forcibly remove the men.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said this week that the asylum seekers should move to the \u201cvery high-quality\u201d accommodation prepared for them in the nearby town of Lorengau, but United Nations refugee agency officials said the centers were incomplete and had space for only about 100 people.\u201cThe situation is getting dire,\u201d said Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the refugee agency. \u201cStaying on the island is not a long-term solution, and these asylum seekers are Australia\u2019s responsibility. Australia must be part of the solution.\u201dNick Cumming-Bruce reported from Geneva, and Megan Specia from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young and in Love \u2026 With Lipstick and Eyeliner", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMeghan Roark isn\u2019t too proud to admit she has an addiction. Her habit? Makeup.Ms. Roark, a 27-year-old who works in retail in Abingdon, Va., estimates that she spends $300 a month on cosmetics and skin care. She watches at least three hours of tutorials each week on YouTube, learning new techniques or keeping up on emerging brands. Her morning makeup routine takes 30 minutes and involves up to 15 products.Young shoppers like Ms. Roark are the driving force behind a boom in the cosmetics industry. Always camera ready, they are buying and using almost 25 percent more cosmetics than they did just two years ago and significantly more than baby boomers, according to the research firm NPD. And millennials who identify themselves as \u201cmakeup enthusiasts,\u201d NPD found, are using six products each day.Ms. Roark, after setting aside money she had received as a birthday gift, spent $109 during a recent shopping spree at Ulta Beauty, picking up primer, foundation and a new eye shadow palette. \u201cI think every girl likes buying clothes, but for me, I prefer to spend my money on makeup,\u201d she said.The striking expansion in cosmetics is a bright spot in what is otherwise a challenging environment for retailers and packaged goods companies. Big jumps in the sale of shimmery highlights, lush liquid stain lipsticks and dewy foundations have propelled the stocks of cosmetics giants Est\u00e9e Lauder and L\u2019Oreal to record highs.Moreover, the growth in the cosmetics industry is probably understated, since most estimates fail to capture sales at online retailers like Amazon.The brand\u2019s success illustrates the way that millennials \u2014 who may spend hours on social media platforms watching video bloggers and following so-called influencers \u2014 are rewriting the rules. And brands are racing to evolve with the quickly changing market.Cosmetic companies are shifting ad dollars from traditional television and print platforms to Instagram and YouTube. Trips to exotic locations that were once reserved for editors from glossy magazines now go to influential social media personalities from all over the world who have thousands or even millions of subscribers hanging on their every post. And brands that once partnered with actresses or models to create a new shade of lipstick or blush are now collaborating with these influencers.\u201cIt was stunning,\u201d said Mary Dillon, the chief executive of Ulta, standing inside the retailer\u2019s first store in Manhattan just days before its grand opening in November.Even products that have been around for decades are being \u201cdiscovered\u201d by millennials through social media. Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Double Wear foundation, a product that was launched 30 years ago, is experiencing double-digit growth rates, said Jane Hertzmark Hudis, group president at Est\u00e9e Lauder.\u201cIt\u2019s popular among millennials because it looks great in a selfie,\u201d said Ms. Hertzmark Hudis, who also reported big jumps in sales of skin care products \u2014 particularly masks, which play well on social media and video blogs, or vlogs.Beauty vlogging isn\u2019t new, but brands have rapidly ramped up their involvement with it after seeing the power it has to influence consumers.Some of the earliest adopters of the social media influence strategy were smaller brands that lacked the ad budget or experience for a traditional campaign. Those brands instead got noticed by putting their products into the hands of a growing army of beauty vloggers.The indie brand Becca Cosmetics took it a step further in 2015 when it partnered with Ms. Hill to create a $38 highlighter called \u201cChampagne Pop.\u201d All 25,000 units of the shimmery powder sold in 20 minutes on Sephora.com. Last year, Est\u00e9e Lauder acquired Becca in a deal reportedly worth $200 million.What has also changed is the insatiable appetite of millennials for social media. The same group that might tune out a 30-second television ad will consume hours of videos and postings. In the past year, global views of beauty videos on YouTube surged 60 percent, to 219 billion, according to Pixability, a Boston-based company that tracks influencers and provides data to brands. Pixability estimated that millennials make up 60 percent of the beauty audience on Facebook.While it is easy \u2014 and cheap \u2014 for brands to fling free products at beauty vloggers in hopes of a positive review, brands are now forming closer relationship with them.Influencers are being actively pursued for sponsorships \u2014 videos or posts in which the brand pays the influencer to, presumably, endorse its product. (Under Federal Trade Commission rules, video bloggers must disclose if a post has been paid for, often using #ad or #spon and #companyname to do so.)But brands and influencers are walking a fine line as they form tighter bonds. Beauty influencers who grew their subscriber base by providing honest reviews risk losing that trust if their audience believes that they have been paid to give only glowing reviews.A flash point for some fans are influencer trips. Some cosmetic companies have flown groups of influencers to Bora Bora; Necker Island, the private enclave of Sir Richard Branson in the British Virgin Islands; and Kauai in Hawaii for lavish, all expense paid vacations. In exchange, most influencers agree to post a certain number of YouTube videos or Instagram posts about the company\u2019s products.\u201cThe trips are being villainized in a way because people feel since we\u2019re going on the trips that we won\u2019t be genuine about the products and our reviews,\u201d said Samantha Ravndahl, a 24-year-old influencer from Canada with 2.4 million Instagram followers who has gone to Bora Bora and the Cannes Film Festival with cosmetics companies. \u201cBut the reality of the situation is, with the amount of money that people are making in this industry, a trip to wherever is a drop in the bucket. It\u2019s simply not enough to buy people.\u201dFor brands, there are other risks. Unlike scripted commercials with paid actresses, the brands lose some control over the messaging and content on a video blog. And many influencers, especially mega-influencers with followers that number in the millions, typically have relationships with multiple brands, raising the prospect that an unlucky product will get lost in a mix of hashtags.Gabriel Zamora, a 24-year-old \u201cbeauty boy\u201d vlogger from Los Angeles, said he has relationships with about 20 brands. He said he mostly receives free products from the companies and has been selective about his paid endorsements. This year, Mr. Zamora teamed up with Mac Cosmetics, owned by Est\u00e9e Lauder, for his own lipstick.\u201cA lot of brands are still playing with the idea, \u2018How do we work with influencers and have them not bash our products?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Zamora. \u201cThere are brands that do get their feelings hurt when you do speak badly about a product but the fact is, not every brand is going to launch an entire line of products that are all going to be good. There is going to be a miss.\u201dA company that started on the internet, e.l.f. has eschewed celebrities, including mega-influencers, to tout its relatively inexpensive products. Instead, e.l.f. focused its efforts on locating micro-influencers, up-and-coming beauty vloggers who are still building their audiences.But executives say staying ahead of millennials is a tricky business.\u201cFive years ago, no one talked about Instagram and today, Instagram is probably the number one social media platform for our products,\u201d said Mr. Amin, who has spent 30 years in the packaged goods industry. \u201cAnd five years from now, it will be something else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But then he did: \u201cI made the Cecil iconic!\u201d he declared.On a Monday night a week after his residency began, Mr. Johnson was laughing and cooking before cameras and a boom microphone as Phil Rosenthal, the creator of \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond,\u201d interviewed the chef for his new Netflix food and travel show, \u201cSomebody Feed Phil.\u201d\u201cThey could have picked any chef in the world, and they picked me,\u201d Mr. Johnson crowed.On his Chefs Club menu, rice makes more than one appearance, and rises to a star attraction in the form of \u201ccon\u2019con,\u201d a dish of jollof sticky rice about the size of a moon pie, sweetened with coconut and topped with an eggplant curry and basil. It exudes comfort and grandeur at once.Mr. Parsons said diners from outside Harlem were reluctant to trek during the week to the restaurant, at the corner of St. Nicholas Avenue and West 118th Street. And the menu was \u201ctoo exotic,\u201d he added, for the Cecil to become a weeknight habit for neighborhood residents.\u201cYou\u2019re not actually looking for a cinnamon-dusted guinea fried hen with piri-piri rice on the side,\u201d he said.Mr. Smalls, who remains an owner but had no hand in the new steakhouse menu, disagreed, blaming poor management and a business plan that he said failed to adequately adjust when a planned lunchtime seating never materialized.As the owners tinkered to find the right formula, the restaurants closed, then reopened. Caught in the middle was Mr. Johnson, who started out as chef de cuisine of the Cecil and ended up as executive chef of both restaurants. The job, though, came with little autonomy.Mr. Johnson, 33, said he needed to lay a foundation for himself; his wife, Samiyyah Chapman; and their 3-month-old twins. He told his bosses he wanted a bigger role and more restaurants.\u201cWhen they said to me they really didn\u2019t want to do anything else, I had to go look in the mirror and say, \u2018Would I be content here working for the next 10 years?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, I don\u2019t mean to sound cocky, but I\u2019m just better than that.\u201d He resigned in June.Mr. Johnson has forged ahead alone in other ventures. He was trying to persuade Stephane De Baets, a founder and the president of Chefs Club, to invest in Ingrained Hospitality when another idea came to Mr. De Baets. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come do a pop-up to show me first your cuisine?\u201d Mr. De Baets recalled asking him.That success led to the longer stay at Chefs Club, a cavernous space with an open kitchen where diners can watch the chefs in action.Mr. Johnson has filled the menu with brightly colored dishes and flavors, seen most obviously in a shared plate of cornmeal-crusted sea bass, seasoned with turmeric, that takes up an entire bowl and leaves just enough room for purple sweet potatoes, roasted carrots, papaya and long beans.A few dishes, like udon noodles with braised goat, and piri-piri prawns, have followed Mr. Johnson to Chefs Club from the Cecil. His favorite dessert is a rice milk pop of raspberry and hibiscus with crispy puffed rice drizzled on top.At Chefs Club, Mr. Johnson also did something he could never do at the Cecil: He put his name on it, placing the neon letters \u201cJJ\u201d in the window. He also required the restaurant to play his days-long soundtrack, which he commissioned a D.J. to compile. On a recent night, several diners bobbed their heads and swayed in their seats.Music plays as much of a role in dining as food, Mr. Johnson said, recalling how his Puerto Rican grandmother played salsa while she prepared sofrito and plantain dumplings, and how his black American grandmother, raised in the Rocky Mountains, played Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Earth Wind & Fire as she made cherry pies and traditional Southern food.His taste runs to \u201890s neo-soul and hip-hop. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the diaspora,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I feel like black artists were having the best times in their careers. They were able to really put their music out. Like Biggie, Tupac, Wu-Tang, Mariah, Erykah Badu, they were talking about real stuff that was happening in our lives.\u201dFor $360, a diner can have everything on the menu in a tasting that Mr. Johnson calls \u201cIt Was All a Dream,\u201d a nod to The Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s \u201cJuicy.\u201d\u201cThis is a dream for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI get to the cook the food of who I am and listen to the music that I want to listen to.\u201dMr. Johnson said he also wants to create jobs and hire people who look like him. His give-back attitude appears to come from his parents, Marcela Johnson, a retired teacher, and Joe Johnson, a bookkeeper who still runs a youth basketball program in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, where they raised their son and his younger sister. The family traveled on vacation to Barbados, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and North Carolina \u2014 trips that, in reflection, helped him see the African diaspora firsthand.Though Mr. Johnson excelled in a variety of sports, including skiing, basketball and soccer, he wanted to be a chef.

Ronald Reagan, an aircraft carrier engaged in joint exercises with Japan\u2019s navy in the Philippine Sea, when it crashed, according to the statement. The plane had been making a routine transport flight from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, the statement said.The eight personnel rescued were undergoing medical evaluation on the Ronald Reagan and were in good condition, the statement said. It said the crash would be investigated.Speaking to reporters, Itsunori Onodera, Japan\u2019s defense minister, said a United States source had indicated that the aircraft might have had engine trouble.Based in Yokosuka, Japan, the Seventh Fleet is the Navy\u2019s biggest and busiest overseas fleet, with 20,000 sailors and 50 to 70 vessels.Hiroyuki Yamamura, a former commander in Japan\u2019s navy, said that accidents tended to come in succession. \u201cBut even so, we have heard of so many accidents this year,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year is a bad year.\u201dToshiyuki Ito, a professor of crisis management and international relations at Kanazawa Institute of Technology and a retired vice admiral with the Maritime Self-Defense Force, said he suspected the crew of the aircraft might have been exhausted.\u201cThe situation in Asia is becoming tense as well, and they must work more and longer,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe accidents are caused by human errors. You know, maintenance is also done by people. Even one mistake in the chain of human work towards safety can lead to an accident.\u201dLast month, a transport helicopter made an emergency landing after catching fire in a United States military training area on the northern part of Okinawa.

{"Headline": "New York Punk, Out of Retirement", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "Rockers from the downtown scene of the 1970s and \u201980s are keeping the flame alive, and their gray-haired fans are happy to party like it\u2019s 1979.Supported byFriday night on the Lower East Side, and Janis Shaw was being carded. It was autumn, so darkness was arriving sooner and sooner each night. This rock show started early, 7 p.m., and the sun had already set.In the shadows, Janis can look like a teenager, the same teenager who frequented clubs like CBGB and Max\u2019s Kansas City back in their 1970s heyday. She\u2019s petite, dressed in a black leather jacket, her hair spiked and dyed platinum. But she\u2019s no kid.They headed to the bar, where they met up with Janis\u2019s husband, Kevin Shaw, the bassist for another band playing that night, the Hipp Pipps.\u201cWe used to get in at Max\u2019s when we were 15, no problem,\u201d said Mr. Shaw, who is tall and lanky and obviously not 15 anymore. He has wrinkles, white hair, arthritis, scoliosis and the hearing loss of a 63-year-old who has experienced some hard living. He and Janis met in their early 20s at Max\u2019s when she was playing in the Crayolas and he was in the BMTs, both bands part of the 1970s downtown New York scene.They were at Arlene\u2019s with several dozen fellow veterans, those who never quite made the big time. There was a guy in the corner who used to play with Johnny Thunders, and a woman who used to sing backup for Ronnie Spector. There were those whose record contracts had long expired, and those who never landed a contract. They all hugged and kissed as they met one another yet again in the comfort of a dark club.Many of their friends and contemporaries fell victim years ago to drugs and hard living: Thunders and several of his fellow New York Dolls, two of the Cramps, most of the Ramones, Stiv Bators from the Dead Boys and a legion of the undiscovered. But they were here that night to celebrate that they\u2019re still kicking.In the last few years it has become a tribal ritual, every week or two, to see old friends play. Some have wandered back from the suburbs or from retirement to the old neighborhood to join a new scene, a community that\u2019s risen out of the ashes and bones of the old one.These survivors are here to keep the wolf from the door \u2014 to socialize, to dance and drink. But mostly they are here to rock.And they are not alone. Musicians from back in the day \u2014 in acts old and new like Manitoba NYC, Bush Tetras, Exit 99, Lenny Kaye, New York Junk, the Phil Gammage Quartet, Gass Wild, Cheetah Chrome, the Skelecasters, The Fleshtones and Walter Lure and the Waldos \u2014 are gigging like there\u2019s no tomorrow. They\u2019re as punk as it gets \u2014 with nothing to prove, no chance of selling out and a special brand of nihilism that can only come with old age.Among the 80-strong crowd, people held iPhones to document the moment. Since, frankly, it could be the last moment. Some in the crowd were concerned for the health of the band\u2019s hard-driving drummer, Sal Cappi, whose exertion was a bit alarming.Earlier that week, Mr. Cappi, 62, was reminiscing about decades playing in New York and on the road. \u201cThese are some of the best musicians in the country right here,\u201d he said of the old New York scenesters. Even though he plays a vintage 1966 set of sparkly red Ludwigs, he said, \u201cI\u2019m still learning new stuff, new tricks.\u201dBack in the day, the Rousers were pulling in $1,000 a show at nightclubs like Hurrah. They had roadies, and girlfriends in different towns. In 1979 they were offered an EP deal with Epic Records, home to the Clash, but their manager turned it down. \u201cHe told them we wanted a full album or nothing,\u201d Mr. Milmore said, shaking his head. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know about it until years later.\u201dThey persevered. Madonna, around the time she left her alternative band, Emmy and the Emmys, opened for them as a solo act at Max\u2019s, right before it closed in 1981. That year they released a single, produced by MC5\u2019s Wayne Kramer. It got good press, including a write up from this paper, which called it \u201cpsychedelic rockabilly,\u201d but it got no traction.\u201cThings happen for a reason,\u201d Mr. Cappi said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be. That life, that rock \u2019n\u2019 roll life, is a life of heavy partying. So being famous might have led to my early demise.\u201dThere was a time, about a decade ago, when the Rousers would only play a few gigs a year. \u201cThere was no scene anymore,\u201d said Mr. Milmore, 61, whose light hair, once long, is now short and thinning on top. \u201cEveryone had seen us already and would be like, \u2018You guys are playing again?\u2019\u201dBut then the kids grew up and moved out. Some retired from their dreaded day jobs. They all started reconnecting \u2014 not at old bars like Grassroots, but on Facebook. And the bitterness of competition and of not being famous rock stars began to fade. \u201cAll of a sudden I had a social life again that didn\u2019t revolve around the PTA,\u201d Mr. Milmore said.Now they all play out regularly, and the audience has been growing. Back in May, the Rousers played a show at Le Poisson Rouge on Bleecker Street to celebrate the release of Philippe Marcad\u00e9\u2019s memoir, \u201cPunk Avenue\u201d \u2014 which recounts his days playing with his band, the Senders, who were regulars at Max\u2019s. Lenny Kaye, from Patti Smith Group, and Walter Lure, the only surviving member of the Heartbreakers (not Tom Petty\u2019s, but Johnny Thunders\u2019s), both played. The club was packed.A month later they all played a Max\u2019s reunion show at Bowery Electric, another high energy gig where Mr. Marcad\u00e9 threw streamers into the audience just like in the old days, fans screaming, guitars and ears ringing.Mr. Shaw, bass player for the Hipp Pipps, said there was a simple reason the band is better than his bands in the 1980s, and it has nothing to do with practice. \u201cWe\u2019re more sober now,\u201d he said.\u201cEveryone playing now just loves playing,\u201d said Ms. Shaw, who once shared a loft space with Mr. Marcad\u00e9 and the Senders. Her husband, standing next to her at the bar, waiting to go onstage, nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to get noticed or get famous,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when the spirit comes out.\u201d\u201cJust playing,\u201d Ms. Shaw added, \u201cfor the joy of it.\u201dMr. Dickson, the 62-year-old bass player and singer who has been playing with Mr. Milmore since high school, agreed that no one was in it for the money. \u201cNow we spend as much at the bar as we make,\u201d he said. \u201cThose days of the $1,000 paydays are well behind us.\u201d\u201cBack then,\u201d Mr. Milmore said, \u201cyou didn\u2019t want to clap too loud when you saw another band.\u201d People got upset if they were billed lower than another group. \u201cYou\u2019d be like, \u2018There\u2019s no way I\u2019m opening for them.\u2019 But there\u2019s not a lot of that anymore.\u201d He paused. \u201cWell, maybe a little bit.\u201dReplacing that sense of competition is a palpable warmth and new sense of community that didn\u2019t exist so much back in the late \u201970s and \u201980s. Birthdays are celebrated at gigs with cakes and candles. Money is placed generously in the bucket at the end of the night. Cigarettes not so grudgingly offered out on the sidewalk. There are more hugs. Fewer fights.And friends are there when disaster strikes.Then his phone started ringing. \u201cIt was all these musicians who said, \u2018When you form a new band, can I play with you?\u2019 These are not flashy pretenders, but the real deal. Seasoned musicians. And the fact that they were reaching out was\u2026.\u201d He started to choke up. \u201cIt was tear-inducing.\u201d So Mr. Sztabnik dried his eyes and started a new band.Now everyone is so busy playing out, it\u2019s hard to even schedule a rehearsal. Dressed in a black Fender T-shirt, a tuxedo jacket and Elvis Costello-style black horn-rimmed glasses, Mr. Sztabnik was in his basement rehearsal studio, a tiny soundproofed room, packed with drums and amps, the walls lined with classic Gretsch and Gibson guitars and \u201970s and \u201980s posters, some with his old bands\u2019 names on them. Mr. Sztabnik played a few short licks on his cowboy orange Gretsch hollow body and considered the path he had taken.Back in the 1970s, Hilly Kristal, the owner of CBGB, wanted to put his band\u2019s first album out. They were called Uncle Son, named after the Kinks song. \u201cBut you had to sign away your life to him,\u201d Mr. Sztabnik said. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t want to sign everything over. So we passed.\u201d There were dozens of other bands waiting in the wings who would be more than happy to sign everything over.\u201cThink about that episode of \u2018I Love Lucy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sztabnik said, \u201cwith the unending line of candy on the conveyor belt. The bands just kept coming.\u201dIn the early \u201980s, he and his brother Joe formed the Dragons. They were courted by Warner Bros., but were never signed. He can still recall the time WNEW played them as part of a four song set that also featured the Beatles, the Stones and the Who. \u201cI heard it while driving in my car,\u201d said Mr. Sztabnik, eyes wide behind his glasses. \u201cI almost drove off the L.I.E.\u201dBut it seemed that the higher they climbed, the further the next rung on the ladder seemed to be. \u201cUntil getting up to the next rung was just beyond our reach,\u201d Mr. Sztabnik said.He \u2014 and everyone he knows, he said \u2014 thinks his new band, DonBlackCat and Friends, is better than his old band. They\u2019d only had one gig so far, at SideWalk Cafe at the end of September, but they \u201cblew everyone away,\u201d he said excitedly.\u201cI\u2019m blown away that this fire of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll not only did not get extinguished, did not suffocate from lack of oxygen, but is thriving,\u201d he said, of the new scene. \u201cWe\u2019re all playing the same chords, but nothing sounds the same. We all have a story to tell. All you have to do is walk in the front door to listen to it.\u201dNaturally, Mr. Sztabnik was at the Rousers gig at Arlene\u2019s Grocery. He was dressed like a kid, in a horizontal striped shirt, leather jacket and jeans. His new band and the Hipp Pipps share a drummer, Frankie Pipps, whose long ponytail was topped by a big black baker boy hat. Mr. Pipps, 59, played drums in the late \u201970s with the Mystery Girls, opening in theaters for the Ramones and Blondie. One of his later bands, Who Killed Bambi, was signed to Epic, but broke up soon after. Mr. Pipps retreated to clubs up in Westchester, but it wasn\u2019t the same. \u201cI got bored out of my face,\u201d he said. \u201cI needed some New York City back in my blood.\u201dAt Arlene\u2019s, Mr. Pipps laid down a heavy, solid foundation, and when he was joined by Mr. Shaw\u2019s bass, the ground actually began to shake. Mr. Sztabnik clapped and shouted, and in no time, he was dancing with Ms. Shaw.The Hipp Pipps was Ms. Shaw\u2019s idea. The trio was a kind of supergroup of retired rockers, and they were the headliners that night at Arlene\u2019s.Mr. Shaw, who suffers from painful arthritis and scoliosis, was at center stage, swinging his bent body gracefully, and he suddenly transformed into a 15-year-old, smiling, pressing foreheads together with Matt Langone, whose fingers were flying across his guitar\u2019s frets. Mr. Shaw stopped every now and then at the microphone to trade off songs with Mr. Langone, who was sweating profusely.The audience was just as into it, heads bopping, people singing along to Mr. Langone\u2019s lyrics. Women screaming. Old women, young women. It was like Shea Stadium, circa 1966. With 45,000 fewer people. But still.When the final chord rang out and Mr. Pipps hit his battered cymbals for the last time, everyone cheered, then spilled onto the sidewalk for a cigarette and post-mortem. It was only 10 p.m., which was when things usually got started back in the day. Mr. Milmore approached the Hipp Pipps. \u201cMatt was on fire tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought he might \u2026\u201d He clutched his hands over his chest to simulate a heart attack.But Mr. Langone was energized and was talking about heading over to the SideWalk Cafe to see a few more bands. After all, the night was young.Helene Stapinski is the author, most recently, of \u201cMurder in Matera.\u201d Her previous memoir, Baby Plays Around,\u201d recounted her nights playing drums in a band on the Lower East Side.

{"Headline": "Robert Reich, a Multiplatform Gadfly, Comes to Netflix", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAsked to pick a spot for lunch to discuss the new Netflix documentary, \u201cSaving Capitalism,\u201d a representative for Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, proposed Bobby Van\u2019s Steakhouse, across the street from the New York Stock Exchange.It was an odd choice. Mr. Reich, the pugnacious economist and ardent critic of income inequality, has spent his career railing against Wall Street and what he sees as its corrosive influence on American society. Bobby Van\u2019s is a watering hole for investment bankers and stock traders.Nonetheless, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 lit up as soon as Mr. Reich walked in the door. \u201cI love your posts on Facebook,\u201d said the host, a barrel-chested man wearing a power suit and pink tie. \u201cI watch you on MSNBC all the time. Keep up the good work, Dr. Reich.\u201dTwo decades removed from his position in the Clinton cabinet, Mr. Reich, 71, is a multi-platform attack dog of the far left, a verbose gadfly who can be counted on to deliver withering critiques of Republicans, Democrats, lobbyists, lawyers and even former colleagues.His newfound social media acumen seems only to have made him more quarrelsome. He has more than a half million followers on Twitter, where he posts a daily fusillade of indignant tweets aimed at President Trump.But where the French economist Thomas Piketty brings an academic distance to his writing on inequality and Senator Bernie Sanders channels a righteous indignation in the political realm, Mr. Reich comes across as exactly what he is \u2014 a frumpy, sometimes pedantic professor from the University of California at Berkeley, eager to lecture anyone who will listen about our broken financial world.\u201cThe central thesis of the book and the movie is that the game really is rigged,\u201d he said over a small garden salad, which he ordered as an entree.That thesis, presented with a look of grave concern, makes for an easy sound bite, but it can be hard to prove. Yet Mr. Reich gives it a try in \u201cSaving Capitalism,\u201d which was directed by Jacob Kornbluth, who also directed Mr. Reich\u2019s previous film, \u201cInequality for All.\u201d\u201dSaving Capitalism\u201d follows Mr. Reich on a journey around the country as he talks to rural voters, politicians and small business owners. Along the way, using historical footage and animations, he explains what he says has been the systematic takeover of the legislative process by corporations and the wealthy.Though the Powell Memo surely wasn\u2019t the only reason, lobbyists began flooding Washington, and over the last 50 years, he said, many laws have been enacted that favor corporations and the wealthy.For Mr. Reich, these episodes and countless others he can cite are proof that lawmakers are more often than not looking out for the interests of corporations, not voters. \u201cWith great wealth has also come great political power,\u201d he said. \u201cWealth buys everything from tax breaks, to bailouts, to subsidies, to laws that on their face look to be neutral, but actually help particular companies or industries or wealthy people.\u201dThis is a sorry state of affairs, he suggests, and one that wasn\u2019t inevitable. Democratic presidents could have embraced labor law reform and made it easier to form unions, he said. Politicians, workers and investors could have pushed back against the corporate raiders in the 1980s, who glorified short-term profits and made enormous personal fortunes. And the government could have resisted the push to deregulate Wall Street.Putting the genie back in the bottle won\u2019t be easy, though. As convincing as he is in making his case against the flaws in our current version of capitalism, Mr. Reich is less so when it comes to prescribing a remedy. He comes prepared with a laundry list of progressive pipe dreams. Get big money out of elections. Stop the revolving door between government and industry groups. End gerrymandering of voting districts. Raise the minimum wage.Yet for any of these to happen, Democrats would have to start winning more elections. And at the end of the Netflix film, he implores viewers to organize and vote. He knows it won\u2019t be easy, but he says the alternative is bleak. \u201cIf we\u2019re not vigilant, we will lose our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public is waking up to that fact.\u201dIf it all sounds familiar, it is because Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders and even Donald J. Trump have appealed to disaffected workers in recent presidential campaigns.\u201cThe country is catching up with him,\u201d Darrell West, vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said of Mr. Reich. \u201cFor a long time he was preaching in the wilderness. Now there\u2019s a closer fit between his critique and how ordinary people view the world.\u201d\u201cWe are on the way to becoming a two-tiered society, composed of a few winners, and a larger group of Americans left behind, whose anger and whose disillusionment is easily manipulated,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce unbottled, mass resentment can poison the very fabric of society, the moral integrity of a society, replacing ambition with envy, replacing tolerance with hate.\u201dCaptured in \u201cSaving Capitalism,\u201d Mr. Reich\u2019s remarks, made 23 years ago, could have just as easily been spoken today.Advertisement"}

Her cabinet is a snake pit of personal and political scandal. Her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, seems unhinged.But at least she knows how the leader of a democracy should respond to an egomaniacal, autocratic leader who shows no concern for international law, human rights, civil liberties or freedom of thought and speech.No, I\u2019m not talking about President Trump.\u201cIt is Russia\u2019s actions which threaten the international order on which we all depend,\u201d May said on Monday night at the Lord Mayor\u2019s banquet in London, where she delivered the kind of tough-minded message to the Kremlin that American presidents used to send:I want to be clear about the scale and nature of these actions. Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea was the first time since the Second World War that one sovereign nation has forcibly taken territory from another in Europe. Since then, Russia has fomented violence in the Donbas, repeatedly violated the air space of several European countries, and mounted a sustained campaign of cyberespionage and disruption. This has included meddling in elections and hacking the Danish Ministry of Defense and the Bundestag, among many others. It is seeking to weaponize information, deploying its state-run media organizations to plant fake stories and Photoshopped images in an attempt to sow discord in the West and undermine our institutions.May had a \u201cvery simple message\u201d for the Kremlin. \u201cWe know what you were doing and you will not succeed,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you underestimate the resilience of our democracies, the enduring attraction of free and open societies, and the commitment of Western nations to the alliances that bind us.\u201dTrump\u2019s message to the Kremlin is simple, too: Do what you want.He believes President Vladimir Putin is \u201csincere\u201d in denying Russian attempts to meddle in the American elections, and is tired of asking about it \u2014 if he ever actually did. He is not going to raise human rights with Putin. He\u2019s eager to work with Russia on Syria, where Putin is determined to shore up a bloodthirsty dictator.On Oct. 1, Trump\u2019s administration ignored a deadline set by Congress to say how it will carry out sanctions against Russia for its cyberattack on American democracy. Instead, Trump has spent his time trying to undermine the Russian investigations, which he calls a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d even though the list of contacts between Trump aides and the Russians just keeps growing.The Kremlin, you may recall, also said the people of Hungary and Czechoslovakia wanted Soviet tanks to crush their democracy movements a half-century ago and that it was invited into Afghanistan.Far from denouncing Putin\u2019s continuous assaults on human rights and free speech in Russia, Trump has praised him as being a better leader than Obama.And he gave a pass to the world\u2019s autocrats in his United Nations speech this fall, telling them \u201cyou should always put your countries first.\u201d\u201cThe nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition,\u201d Trump said, just the sort of message that dictators like Putin have been wanting to hear from the United States for decades.So much for being the leader of the free world.Contrast Trump\u2019s behavior not just with May\u2019s, but also that of Ronald Reagan, who was viscerally opposed to Communism and entered office determined to bring down the Soviet empire.Reagan came to believe that Mikhail Gorbachev was trying to contract, not expand, Soviet power. But he never lost sight of the Russian threat to the West and kept up the pressure even as he developed a relationship with Gorbachev aimed at keeping the world safe from Russia, not at keeping Russia safe from the world.Reagan and Gorbachev came tantalizing close in 1986 to agreeing on nuclear disarmament. Trump wants to have more nuclear weapons and has threatened to use them.Trump studiously avoids talking about human rights in Russia (and Turkey, China, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines, among others).(Note to Trump: Look up the phrase \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d during a commercial break on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d)In October, Trump\u2019s administration waived human rights requirements and approved the sale of $5 billion worth of fighter planes to Bahrain.A lot, actually, like when Reagan went to Berlin and yelled: \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Stayed Put, but Their City Disappeared", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDamascus JournalDAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 On a cool evening in early November, in a back room of the Damascus Opera House, a women\u2019s choir was rehearsing an old favorite, a sunny ballad from a childhood cartoon. When they reached the chorus \u2014 \u201cHow sweet it is to live in one house, how sweet to live in one hometown\u201d \u2014 one of the singers, Safana Baqleh, began to weep into her hands.The song reminded her of all that she had lost. Her closest friends had either left Syria or blocked her on Facebook over political disagreements. Sometimes, the solitude felt crushing. \u201cI want to take my baby for a walk, but I have no one to visit,\u201d Ms. Baqleh said. \u201cNo one. Absolutely no one.\u201dAfter more than six years of war, nearly a fourth of all Syrians live in exile. The loneliness of those who remain hangs like thick fog over Damascus, the capital. Lifelong Damascenes wonder why they are still here, when so many friends and family have packed up, died or disappeared. Newcomers, displaced by the war, move cautiously, unsure about their fate, or who is who.I traveled to Damascus recently on a rare visa issued to an American journalist. I was almost always accompanied by a government-registered escort, which seemed to make some people reticent, and there were parts of the city I wasn\u2019t allowed to visit.In a park in the city\u2019s center, families who fled the latest war zones sit with plastic bags and babies. A soldier sits in the bushes, keeping a close eye on everything and everyone.On the main highway, shiny new restaurants cater to people who have enriched themselves during the war. In the middle of the workday, you walk in to find men in track suits silently smoking water pipes, watching everyone. And yet nearby, Damascenes who could once afford new clothes look through piles of secondhand sweaters because prices have shot up beyond reach. In a certain city market, I was told, the spoils of war show up for sale: refrigerators, pipes, chandeliers, all looted from towns recently reclaimed by the military. (I did not have a permit to visit the market myself.)Every time I asked Syrians how they explained the events of the past seven years to their children, I was struck by how even the most garrulous among them fell into silence, or just shook their heads. They struggled to explain it to themselves.Ms. Baqleh, 35, who is also a professional harpist, couldn\u2019t say why she remained in the country. She knew only that she couldn\u2019t stand the idea of living as a refugee abroad, seen as someone who needs charity rather than someone who belongs. So she stayed and tried to make a difference. She taught music. She sang. She volunteered at an animal shelter. Dogs and cats not only have been wounded in the war, she said, but also mutilated by children who had learned unspeakable cruelty.\u201cWe need things to bind us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need each other.\u201dFor their spring concert, the women\u2019s choir \u2014 the Gardenia Chorus, they called themselves \u2014 had chosen a repertoire of wedding songs representing the many peoples of Syria: songs in Arabic, Kurdish and Circassian, songs from places now synonymous with ruin, like Aleppo and Hama.The conductor, Ghada Harb, 43, said it was their way of preserving a culture at risk of ruin. Also, she said, she hoped the songs would remind Syrians \u201cto be accepting of each other.\u201dMs. Harb considered herself lucky. She still had a home, a job. Her husband was too old to be conscripted into the military; her sons were too young. But every day, she prayed that her children would get home safely. She dreaded the day when they would leave her, as the adult children of so many of her relatives had done already.The war had changed how she moves through the city. If a car with black windows cuts her off in traffic, she is reluctant to press her horn or complain out loud. There\u2019s no telling who could be inside, or how they might react. One day, as she waited in a long line for fuel, she watched as a man in army fatigues angrily started slashing the plastic fuel containers that people had brought with them. She had no idea what set him off.\u201cThe trace of war stays inside us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working. We continue. But something inside us is sad and broken. We are very humiliated.\u201dAt this, she began to cry.We were sitting in a busy, brightly lit restaurant in a well-off part of the city. Waiters went from table to table, bearing enormous platters of grilled chicken, tabbouleh, onion rings. Water pipes were lit. Pomegranate juice was served.\u201cWe feel like strangers,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cWe are living in the same place but we have lost the people who lived here.\u201dIn the narrow lanes of the old city, dominated by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia and militant group that backs Mr. Assad, funeral posters announce the deaths of smiling young men. Men in their 20s and 30s, subject to military service, are the likeliest to leave, so much so that some employers say they prefer to hire and train young women instead. \u201cPack Your Bags\u201d is the name of a television serial, a comedy.To remain in the country is especially stinging for those who once agitated against Mr. Assad\u2019s authoritarian government. They find it hard to square the uprising they joined and the violence that followed, the kidnappings, car bombs and government sieges so crippling that children starved in Yarmouk, a Palestinian enclave in the heart of the capital. Or they find that their onetime friends spurn them.\u201cIf they know your political affiliations,\u201d Hala al-Chach, a businesswoman, said, \u201cthey treat you like someone who smells.\u201dThe conflict has made violence numbingly ordinary.An art dealer, Samer Kozah, lives in his ancient family house, surrounded by the works of artists who have fled.In the past, young artists would trickle into his shop on Friday afternoons to show him their work, or just to talk about art and sip Mr. Kozah\u2019s Nescaf\u00e9. Now there are hardly any artists left. Mr. Kozah, who established a gallery in his home 23 years ago, helped many of them establish themselves elsewhere \u2014 Beirut, Vienna, Paris.\u201cI feel, sometimes, I don\u2019t want to call it depression. I feel boring,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mind is slowing down.\u201dMr. Kozah and his wife, Olga, a jewelry designer, left for a while, too, only to be pulled back home earlier this year. He said he missed walking along the narrow warrens of the old city, greeting his neighbors, on his way to Nowfara, his favorite cafe. He missed the orange tree in his courtyard. He missed the quiet of the mornings. When there are no bombs, he said, you can still hear birds.I asked him how the city had changed, which struck me as a harmless question, but it made him burst into tears. His wife left the courtyard where we were sitting.One of her brothers disappeared four years ago and hasn\u2019t been heard from since, Mr. Kozah said softly after she was out of earshot. Her father\u2019s jewelry shop was looted clean.\u201cEverybody has a story,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody died. Somebody lost their house. I walk here. I smell the jasmine, I go to Nowfara. I drink tea. Everybody, their faces changed. No one is the same.\u201dHwaida Saad contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Berlusconi\u2019s Comeback Hopes Buoyed by Sicily Election Results", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 A candidate backed by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi claimed victory on Monday in Sicily\u2019s regional elections, adding momentum to Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s own political comeback before national elections next year.This \u201cis a victory for moderate\u201d voters, Mr. Berlusconi said.Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s candidate, Nello Musumeci, the candidate of a coalition of center-right parties for governor of Sicily, won with 39 percent of the vote, while the Five Star Movement\u2019s Giancarlo Cancelleri, took nearly 35 percent. The anti-establishment movement ran on its own, becoming the island\u2019s leading party.The vote was a decisive defeat for another former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, whose Democratic Party was part of a coalition that lost political control of the island.Mr. Renzi\u2019s candidate, Fabrizio Micari, received just 18.5 percent of the vote, and critics accused Mr. Renzi, who is considering his own political comeback, of splitting the Democrats over the choice of a candidate.The outcome of the elections reflects the three-way deadlock that emerged from national elections in 2013, though in the case of Sicily, with a shift to the right, \u201cperhaps anticipating a national trend,\u201d Massimo Franco wrote in a front-page editorial in the Milan daily, Corriere della Sera, on Monday.\u201cThe least reassuring element is the confirmation of nonparticipation that kept more than half of all potential voters at home. It\u2019s a sign of deep malaise toward the parties,\u201d he wrote. Even the Five Star Movement that capitalizes on the crisis of the traditional parties, \u201cwas not able to attract voters who feel detached from politics,\u201d he wrote.The regional poll was being closely watched in Italy as a litmus test for national elections, expected early next year, and it exposed both the strengths and the weaknesses of Italy\u2019s political contenders.Mr. Berlusconi, who turned 81 in September, was not on the ballot. But the former four-time prime minister managed to coalesce several bickering center-right and right-leaning parties into a winning coalition, a feat he said he hoped to replicate on the national stage.While he will not be able to run next year \u2014 he is barred from elected office because of a 2013 conviction for tax fraud \u2014 Mr. Berlusconi clearly hopes to be the power behind the throne.The Five Star Movement was looking for a victory that would have allowed it to run a region of Italy for the first time, and to build credibility as a governing party after lackluster administrations in the major cities where they already hold power, like Rome.But the movement failed to gain a clear majority in the Sicilian vote. Its avowed refusal to make alliances with other political parties limits the party\u2019s ability to maneuver, even in the event of a strong electoral showing, or to govern.Furthermore, a new, contested national elections law that passed last month allows parties to run for seats as coalitions, a measure the Five Star Movement says was introduced to keep it out of power.In any case, no coalition or party managed to win an outright majority in Sicily, forcing negotiations to find other allies, or risk a hung government.Speaking to supporters Monday evening, Mr. Cancelleri boasted that in Sicily, the Five Star Movement \u201cis the leading political force,\u201d and the electoral results \u201csent a message to rest of Italy: Finally something can change.\u201d Sicily, he said, represented \u201cthe change we hoped for and wanted.\u201d\u201cWe stopped Sicily from falling into the hands of the Five Star Movement, people who have never done anything, who haven\u2019t even administered a condominium, who have never worked,\u201d he said. And Italians faced a similar choice in national elections in the near future, he said. \u201cWe are the only alternative.\u201dThe loss in Sicily was a smack in the face for Mr. Renzi, who stepped down from power 11 months ago after being defeated in a referendum on constitutional reform. He has struggled to keep his party in tow since then, and his leadership of the Democrats has been frequently challenged.On Monday, one of his left-leaning political opponents, the former ally Roberto Speranza, who started a breakaway party earlier this year, said the Sicilian vote was a \u201cresounding defeat\u201d for the Democrats under Mr. Renzi\u2019s leadership and prefigured a similar scenario \u201con the national level.\u201dElections were also held in Ostia, a seaside resort near Rome, where the center-left candidate was easily beaten. A runoff ballot will be held in two weeks, pitting the Five Star Movement against the center-right candidate.Fewer than 50 percent of the eligible Sicilian voters \u2014 2.1 million out of 4.6 million \u2014 cast ballots, the lowest ever in regional elections, widely read as a sign of collective disenchantment with politics.As if to challenge Mr. Renzi\u2019s standing, Luigi Di Maio, the Five Star Movement\u2019s candidate for prime minister, canceled a televised debate with him that was to be held Tuesday evening.After the Sicilian vote, Mr. Renzi\u2019s Democratic Party \u201cno longer has a leader,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investigating Gerrymandering and the Math Behind Partisan Maps", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMathMath lies at the heart of gerrymandering, in which the shapes of voting districts and distributions of voters are manipulated to preserve and expand political power.In this lesson, we help students uncover the mathematics behind these biased electoral maps. And, we help them apply their mathematical knowledge to identify and address the problem.In fact, the questions students will work through are similar to those the Supreme Court is now considering on whether gerrymandering can ever be declared unconstitutional._________About Gerrymandering in GeneralAbout the Supreme Court Case Considering Wisconsin\u2019s Republican-Drawn District MapThe Supreme Court will decide if the judicial branch should declare the worst partisan gerrymanders as unconstitutional, or if gerrymandering is a problem that only politicians \u2014 and not the courts \u2014 can resolve._________Shapes, Geometry and GerrymanderingA fun way to introduce students to the subject of gerrymandering is to have them describe what shapes they see in some of the most contorted districts \u2014 like they might do when looking at clouds. After all, the Boston Gazette described Governor Gerry\u2019s district as a dragon-like \u201cmonster.\u201dAfter completing this activity, and sharing students\u2019 creative ideas, explain to the class that the Supreme Court is now deciding a case that may determine if and when gerrymandering is unconstitutional. In an earlier decision, Justice Anthony Kennedy said he would consider putting an end to the most partisan gerrymandering if a \u201cworkable standard\u201d can be created to measure it.Then discuss: Do you think the shape of a district can be used to reliably determine the extent to which a district is gerrymandered? Are long and thin districts, or jagged boundaries, for example, the result of purposeful engineering of voter distributions? What geometric measurement, if any, could be used to satisfy Justice Kennedy\u2019s search for a \u201cworkable standard\u201d?Be sure to have students find their own congressional district on the map as well. What does its shape look like? How does it score according to Mr. Ingraham\u2019s measurement system?ProportionalityThen, return to the question raised earlier: Do students think a simple proportionality test could be used to create a \u201cworkable standard\u201d for determining undemocratic, or unconstitutional, gerrymandering? Why or why not? And if yes, how would students distinguish between a reasonable level or proportionality and an unreasonable level?The Efficiency GapAt the center of the case is the \u201cefficiency gap,\u201d a relatively new measure of partisan gerrymandering. A federal court in Wisconsin ruled in November that the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature had discriminated against Democratic voters, and it partly relied on the efficiency gap to find that the Wisconsin State Assembly map was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.Whether it\u2019s persuasive to Justice Kennedy \u2014 expected to be the key swing vote in the case \u2014 is another matter. The efficiency gap is not a perfect measure. But it would probably address many of gerrymandering\u2019s problems, with few downsides.So, what is the efficiency gap? In short, the efficiency gap measures the disparity in \u201cwasted\u201d votes between the parties, and larger gaps mean less fair maps. In other words, a congressional district that has one party consistently win by wide margins \u2014 for example, with 80 or 90 percent of the vote \u2014 has many \u201cwasted\u201d votes, since all that is needed to win is a simple majority. A common gerrymandering strategy is to pack voters likely to vote for the opposition party into districts with lots of \u201cwasted\u201d votes.1. First, add the total number of Republican and Democratic votes in a district, and divide that number by 2. The result is the total number of votes needed to win.2. Then, calculate the total number of \u201cwasted\u201d votes for the Republican and Democratic parties in that district. To get these two numbers, first find the difference between the total number of votes needed to win and the number of votes received by the winning party. For the losing party, the number of votes received is the number of \u201cwasted\u201d votes.3. Next, add up the total number of \u201cwasted\u201d votes for each party in each congressional district in a state, and then subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. The result is the net-wasted votes for that state.4. Finally, divide the number of net-wasted votes by the total number of votes in the state. The resulting percentage is the efficiency gap that favors one party or another.Working in pairs or small groups, students can calculate the efficiency gap for their own state. They can also calculate it for states identified as having high efficiency gaps, such as North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Maryland. And, they can calculate it for Iowa, for example, a state where districts are drawn by a nonpartisan committee. What do they notice about their results?Then discuss: Do students think the efficiency gap provides a \u201cworkable standard\u201d for the Supreme Court to identify unconstitutional gerrymandering? Why or why not? If yes, where would students draw the line to determine a reasonable number of \u201cwasted\u201d votes, and an unreasonable number?You can add that the creators of the measurement, Eric McGhee, research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, and Nicholas Stephanopoulos, professor at the University of Chicago Law School, propose that a gap of seven percent or higher should be enough to find that a state may have committed an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. What do students think of this standard?Comparing the Three MeasurementsAsk students to compare the three different measurements (shape, proportionality and efficiency gap) and decide which one seems the most effective at reliably determining when a state might commit an unconstitutional level of partisan gerrymandering.And, you can propose to students: Do you think using a combination of tests might work even better than using a single standard? Why?Students can write an essay using their mathematical calculations and observations to support their argument. And, they can suggest whether they think any of these measures is reliable enough to provide a \u201cworkable standard\u201d for the courts to prohibit the most partisan state maps._________Going Further1. Study How Congressional Districts Change Over TimeStudents should know that congressional districts are redrawn at regular intervals as populations change within states and around the country, based on the results of the decennial U.S. census. For example, California currently has 53 Representatives, but it only had 20 Representatives in the 1930s. And as Pennsylvania\u2019s share of the national population shrank, it went from having 36 Representatives in 1910 to only having 18 today.2. Analyze State Legislative DistrictsGerrymandering doesn\u2019t just affect congressional elections; it also plays an important role in state elections. In most states, legislators get to draw both the congressional districts and the state legislative districts, so state and federal redistricting are very much interrelated.Ask students to apply the three tests above (shape, proportionality and efficiency gap) to the legislative districts in their home state. What do they find out?3. Play Gerrymandering Games4. Look at \u201cCracking\u201d and \u201cPacking\u201d Up CloseWhile students may understand the mathematics behind gerrymandering, they may forget that this partisan strategy has the power to dilute some people\u2019s votes while strengthening other people\u2019s. In other words, gerrymandering has the power to distort a democratic system. Instead of the voters choosing their elected leaders, the elected leaders get to choose their voters.That said, gerrymandering also has the power to help minority groups gain representation in Congress that they otherwise might struggle to obtain. For example, by drawing district lines to \u201cpack\u201d African-American voters into a single district, those in charge of redistricting can increase the likelihood that an African-American candidate will be elected.Ask students: What do you notice about the map? What cities and towns does it include, exclude or split up? Why do you think the people in charge of redistricting might have made these decisions?5. Get InvolvedAsk students to answer the above questions. If their responses demonstrate concern about gerrymandering, then they might want to get involved.

I did \u2014 Googled my way right to it in seconds.\u201cThe Murtadd Brotherhood has emerged as a poisoned spearhead carried by the Crusaders in their war against the Khilafah,\u201d he said in a nearly 5,000-word paean to holy war.What really caught my eye, though, was an article with the headline \u201cJust Terror Tactics.\u201d Beneath a photograph of a Hertz rental truck, the piece read, \u201cThough being an essential part of modern life, very few actually comprehend the deadly and destructive capability of the motor vehicle and its capacity of reaping large numbers of casualties if used in a premeditated manner.\u201dThe article went on to give advice on how to leave the longest \u201ctrail of carnage\u201d possible.New York showed remarkable resilience after the attack, moving unflinchingly into its huge Halloween parade hours later, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio among the costumed revelers. But forgive me if I roll back the tape to examine this latest example of how our media ecosystem can be used against us.The attack in Manhattan lent fresh urgency to questions arising from the debate over social media\u2019s downsides: Is it time to put limits on speech online, sapping the internet\u2019s anything-goes ethos? Or should we accept the occasionally lethal consequences as a cost of freedom?One thing to keep in mind on the to-be-fair side of the ledger: Law enforcement officials give the web platforms some credit for making progress against content that encourages terrorism.\u201cThey\u2019ve really made great strides in taking these things down,\u201d a New York Police Department counterterrorism official, who did not have permission to be quoted by name, told me.Nonetheless, as Google told me over the weekend in a statement, \u201cWhile we\u2019ve made good progress, we recognize there\u2019s more to do.\u201dOne such account \u2014 from a member who goes by Aswarti Media \u2014 taunts Twitter by boasting of the number of times it has regenerated after being shut down, 600 in this case. A recent iteration of the Aswarti account, which Twitter suspended in less than 24 hours, received 700,000 impressions.Hate, it turns out, travels faster than Silicon Valley justice.The terrorists behind such accounts are hard to identify because they often sign into the platforms through virtual private networks, or VPNs, that hide their identities and locations.Terrorism has been around far longer than social media and encrypted file sharing. Nonetheless, modern terrorism could not be quite what it is without it.If the problem is in full view, solutions remain elusive.While testifying at the congressional hearings last week, Mr. Smith seemed to receive a positive response from senators, including Republicans like Lindsey Graham, when he suggested the need for a new \u201clegal framework\u201d that would compel the tech companies to do more. That is especially hard in the United States, with its still-strong First Amendment.Stripping anonymity from social media users in some form appears to be where the legal discussion is going here in the United States. Mr. Smith suggested implementing legislation that would compel tech companies to restrict VPN use on their platforms only to those whose identities they know.\u201cHistorically, the right to speak anonymously is how all sorts of disenfranchised groups were able to speak freely,\u201d Ms. McSherry said. And, she noted, dissidents throughout the world often use VPNs to gain access to and convey information about government abuse. They will be less inclined to do so if they must disclose their identities, even if only to the tech companies, she said.It could be argued that search engines could block or play down results for terrorist content. But some of this material is posted in the name of academic inquiry, which \u201chas helped provide a better understanding of the broader jihadi phenomenon,\u201d said Aaron Y. Zelin, who researches jihadist movements at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.That reminds me \u2014 I\u2019ve got a magazine to get back to. Where was I?

Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s office.A diplomatic answer, but an unhelpful one.We turned to The Associated Press Stylebook, the arbiter of journalistic disputes, which advised that the term generally refers to anywhere in the state north of Westchester County. (The Times\u2019s own stylebook doesn\u2019t dare take on the topic.)The results showed divisions that seem insurmountable: 25 percent said everything north of New York City; 29 percent said everything north of Westchester County; 22 percent said everything north of Poughkeepsie; 7 percent said everything north of Poughkeepsie, excluding the Buffalo area; 9 percent gave other answers; and 7 percent said they weren\u2019t sure.Throughout New York\u2019s political history, Mr. Molinaro said, downstate and upstate have generally been used to describe the political, cultural and demographic differences between two areas: \u201cNew York City and not New York City.\u201dBut the line has blurred over time.\u201cAs New York City residents moved further outside of the city, and still maintained a relationship with the city, the line of upstate has moved further and further north,\u201d he said. He added that over the last 10 years the upstate-downstate line had moved to Poughkeepsie from Beacon, and in another decade he expects it to be north of Dutchess County.\u201cI\u2019m at peace with it that there is no right or wrong answer,\u201d he told us. \u201cUpstate is where you feel it is in your heart.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:We\u2019re confused, but not complaining.It\u2019s not going to last, though. Temperatures are forecast to drop tomorrow.Forget the politicians and the polls: Who knows more about New York than New York Today\u2019s readers?We recently asked for your definitions of where upstate begins. Here are some of the responses:\u201cA working definition of where upstate begins: Where people stop saying \u2018my bodega\u2019 and start saying \u2018my Wegmans.\u2019\u201d\u2014 Alan Oberst, 40, Lower Manhattan\u201cWhen I went to college I was offended when my friends from Long Island and the city referred to northern Westchester as upstate. Then when I moved to the city, and now lower Westchester, I refer to anything north of me as upstate.

{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s Hands-Off Approach to Policing Is Frustrating Some Chiefs", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySPOKANE, Wash. \u2014 Six years ago, a police officer in this city in eastern Washington was convicted of beating a disabled man to death and trying to cover it up. After other alarming episodes involving Spokane officers came to light, the city asked federal officials to suggest changes to the police department as part of an Obama-era policing program.Ever since, use of force by officers has declined, as have complaints from residents.\u201cIt is a great program,\u201d said Craig Meidl, the Spokane police chief. \u201cAs a C.E.O. of a law enforcement organization, you\u2019ll appreciate having an outsider come in and give you advice.\u201dBut in September, the Justice Department announced it would significantly scale back the program, known as the collaborative reform initiative, and reorient it toward more hands-off \u201ctechnical assistance.\u201d The decision to soften what was already a voluntary program was aligned with the Trump administration\u2019s general approach to law enforcement \u2014 cracking down on violent crime, not regulating the police departments that fight it.The changes to collaborative reform reflect the administration\u2019s broader effort to overhaul programs that the Obama administration used to ease tensions between communities and the police, according to interviews with current and former law enforcement officials and documents obtained through freedom of information laws.Since President Trump took office, for example, the Justice Department has not entered into a single court-monitored consent decree with a troubled police department, even in towns with widespread constitutional violations, records show. It has also ordered reviews of existing consent decrees \u2014 which are a tougher, more punitive alternative to the collaborative reform initiative \u2014 negotiated under President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department.The changes, designed to ease pressure on law enforcement, have actually encountered some resistance from police chiefs in cities that participated in the programs. And those chiefs work not only in big-city Democratic strongholds, but also in places like Spokane, which has a Republican mayor and is the largest city in a county that voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump.In interviews, some of the chiefs said the new direction was out of step with a growing consensus that rebuilding community trust is essential to fighting crime, particularly after a spate of high-profile police shootings spurred a national debate on policing and fueled the Black Lives Matter movement and the Blue Lives Matter response. At one point, the collaborative reform initiative was popular enough among chiefs that there was a monthslong wait to join it; now, the Justice Department has told at least one city that it must file a public records request even to see the program\u2019s research on its police department, internal records show.In explaining its decision to chiefs and the media, the Justice Department has said that some police departments complained that the program became too aggressive and produced wide-ranging reports that contained errors.\u201cThe President tasked the Attorney General with reducing violent crime, and the Justice Department believes the changes to the Collaborative Reform Initiative will help accomplish this goal by returning control to local law enforcement agencies and by targeting the department\u2019s assistance to the actual needs of those agencies,\u201d Devin M. O\u2019Malley, a Justice Department spokesman, said in a statement. He added that \u201cAmerica\u2019s law enforcement community stands resolutely with the Attorney General and the decisions he has made to enforce the rule of law,\u201d though the statement did not mention any chiefs who supported Mr. Sessions\u2019s decision to change collaborative reform.Diane Hobley-Burney, the chief of police in Fort Pierce, Fla., in another pro-Trump county, signed up for collaborative reform after an officer killed an unarmed black motorist in 2016. After the Trump administration reined in collaborative reform this September, ending her chance at receiving a report recommending improvements for her police force, Chief Hobley-Burney sent a letter to the Justice Department seeking to remain in the program while expressing how \u201cdisappointed\u201d she was in the program\u2019s reduced ambitions.\u201cWe were working together for the common good,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI did not see it as being heavy-handed in any way.\u201dThe Fraternal Order of Police had a dimmer view of the collaborative reform initiative. While chiefs answer to mayors and city councils, the union represents rank-and-file officers, some of whom faced heavy scrutiny in the wake of police shootings.Interviews and government records show that the police union, along with some of Mr. Sessions\u2019s top advisers, helped to lay the foundation for the Trump administration\u2019s new direction \u2014 all united in opposition to what they consider federal meddling in the affairs of local police.One of the advisers, Steven H. Cook, is a former beat cop who helped advise on the Justice Department\u2019s changes to the collaborative reform initiative, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to reveal internal discussions.A mainstay of conservative law-and-order circles, Mr. Cook ran the National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys, a group that operates loosely as a labor union but also as an advocate for tough-on-crime policies. While leading the group, Mr. Cook teamed up with Mr. Sessions, when he was a senator, to oppose legislation that would have softened mandatory life sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.William C. Killian, who was the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee, where he served as Mr. Cook\u2019s boss, said his former colleague had long been skeptical of federal officials stepping in to second-guess local policing matters.\u201cHe kind of felt like the police officers had a hard enough time as it was,\u201d Mr. Killian said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need any extra pressure on them.\u201dThat philosophy is now evident across the Justice Department as it revisits Obama-era programs aimed at repairing frayed ties with communities.While these changes aligned with Mr. Sessions\u2019s political views, some local chiefs have opposed them.In keeping with the new direction, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed budget seeks essentially no increase in funding for the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, which operates the collaborative reform program and had been poised to receive a large increase in Mr. Obama\u2019s final budget. Mr. Sessions has also not named a new director to run the office.Chuck Jordan, the chief of police in Tulsa, Okla., a Republican stronghold that voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump, said he recently asked the office to review his department after an officer shot an unarmed man. Without a new leader, he said, the office has delayed his request.\u201cEverything is on hold, and that\u2019s not a good place to be in,\u201d said Mr. Jordan, who is instead proceeding with his own community policing changes, including creating a citizens advisory board. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of frustrated by the fact that we\u2019re having trouble getting decisions.\u201dOne night last month, police officers responded to a report of gunshots fired at a home in Spokane. Two white men were suspected of assaulting an African-American man, calling him racial slurs, punching him in the face and threatening him with a gun.After the suspects were arrested, Spokane\u2019s mayor and its police chief stood in unity at a news conference with civil rights advocates, who applauded the police\u2019s handling of the incident.\u201cI\u2019m often asked, \u2018Why do we need to improve our law enforcement community relations?\u2019\u201d Phillip Tyler, the former president of the N.A.A.C.P.\u2019s Spokane chapter, said at the news conference. \u201cThis is why.\u201dChief Meidl and others trace the improved community relations to Spokane\u2019s decision in 2013 to participate in the collaborative reform initiative.\u201cEveryone is facing the right direction,\u201d said Jeffry K. Finer, a civil rights lawyer who represented the estate of Otto Zehm, whose killing by a Spokane officer in 2006 first raised concerns about the department\u2019s problems. Mr. Zehm, who was developmentally disabled, had been trying to buy a Snickers bar at a convenience store when, in an apparent case of mistaken identity, the officer beat him with a baton, shot him with a Taser and hogtied him.Some officers were skeptical of the Justice Department\u2019s presence. But Chief Meidl, a 23-year veteran of the Spokane force who became chief last year, said \u201cfears were minimized\u201d when officers saw that the program was in fact a collaboration with the Justice Department, not a heavy-handed intervention.Collaborative reform was overseen by Bernard Melekian and Ron Davis, both former police chiefs who led the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services during the Obama administration. Their version of collaborative reform relied on a network of private consulting firms staffed with former police executives and academic researchers who analyzed use-of-force data and made regular visits to participating cities, where they met with officers and chiefs and participated in community meetings. The Justice Department would then deliver the cities peer-reviewed reports that identified areas of concern and recommendations for improvement.The result in Spokane, in December 2014, was 42 proposed changes, including better documentation of use of force. The recommendations were nonbinding, but the city\u2019s leadership embraced them, and this year, Chief Meidl reported a 62 percent reduction in complaints and a 29 percent decrease in nondeadly use of force incidents since the collaborative reform initiative was introduced.\u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that we are a better department because of our involvement,\u201d Chief Meidl wrote to city officials.But because of the changes to the program under Mr. Sessions, Spokane will not be getting a final report from the Justice Department confirming the achievements. The report was completed several months ago, according to two people briefed on its drafting, but in September a Justice Department official called Chief Meidl to tell him the program would no longer issue the reports.Chief Meidl objected, and so did David A. Condon, the city\u2019s Republican mayor, who made a final, unsuccessful plea for the report during a visit to the Justice Department in Washington. \u201cThat stamp of approval from an outside agency \u2014 acknowledging the progress made \u2014 is priceless,\u201d Chief Meidl said.The Justice Department said it dropped the reports and made other changes because the program had \u201cevolved to include much broader ranging assessments\u201d that caused \u201cthe unintended consequence of a more adversarial relationship.\u201dThe program\u2019s new direction \u201cwill fulfill the Attorney General\u2019s commitment to respecting local control and accountability,\u201d according to an internal Justice Department email reviewed by The Times.Chief Meidl and other police chiefs said they feared the changes would do the opposite, denying them access to reports that they hoped would build trust with their communities. Even some departments that were lukewarm about participating in the program objected to being denied final reports.In Milwaukee, where some residents complained that collaborative reform was too friendly to the police department, a rough draft of its initial report was leaked to the local news media. That unfinished report contained some errors that painted an overly dark picture of the department, according to federal officials. Although a corrected version has been written, and the police department sought its release to set the record straight, the Justice Department has not done so.Critics say the changes have essentially killed the program, while several police chiefs said they were confused about the new direction and the meaning of \u201ctechnical assistance.\u201d Gina Hawkins, the chief in Fayetteville, N.C., which has been approved for such assistance, said a call with a Justice Department official did not offer clarity.\u201cI said, \u2018Well, what does that mean?\u2019\u201d Chief Hawkins said. The reply from the federal official, she said, was, \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure.\u201dThe Trump administration\u2019s hostility toward consent decrees, the Justice Department\u2019s most coercive tool to address systemic problems in police departments, is greater than its dislike of voluntary efforts like collaborative reform.Although Mr. Sessions has said that \u201ca consent decree is not necessarily a bad thing,\u201d he has also called consent decrees \u201cone of the most dangerous, and rarely discussed, exercises of raw power,\u201d and in March, he ordered a review of all \u201cexisting or contemplated consent decrees.\u201dAdvocates of the settlements worry the review could undercut high-profile consent decrees in place in Baltimore and other cities, where they are designed to correct deep institutional problems in police departments. Mr. Sessions\u2019s Justice Department asked for a 90-day delay in the Baltimore consent decree, which a judge denied.Public records and interviews show that Mr. Sessions\u2019s new direction is also having a chilling effect on potential new consent decrees, even in places where there is local support for them. The department declined to push for one in Chicago, and in the small Acadian city of Ville Platte, La., it appears to have dropped Obama-era efforts to impose one.In 2014, an F.B.I. agent assisting with a murder investigation in Ville Platte stumbled onto a broader problem: The police and sheriff\u2019s deputies there had a habit of throwing people in jail without probable cause or a warrant. The detainees \u2014 including witnesses who were not suspected of a crime \u2014 were held for days and questioned without access to a lawyer, a phone or even, sometimes, toothpaste and tampons.The police chief, Neal Lartigue, acknowledged that the detentions, known as 72-hour holds, had been going on for as long as he could remember, and said that he had not known they were unconstitutional.The F.B.I. agent, Steven Krueger, alerted numerous agencies to his findings, according to interviews with state and local law enforcement officials who recounted the previously unreported events. But his effort stalled: The local district attorney turned out to have been personally involved in the illegal interrogations, the state attorney general at the time declined to take the case, and the state inspector general investigated but did not have the power to prosecute.The case fell to the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division.In a report issued in the waning days of Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure, the civil rights division said the Ville Platte police and the Evangeline Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office had illegally detained at least 900 people in a three-year period.In the Obama administration, such a report typically would have been followed by a consent decree or other court-enforceable agreement, in which the police would agree to carry out specific reforms \u2014 most likely, in Ville Platte\u2019s case, in the areas of training officers and rebuilding trust. Local officials in Ville Platte said they were still awaiting a proposed agreement from the Justice Department, but added that they had fully cooperated with the investigation, which, after all, was instigated by a law enforcement official.In a statement, Mr. O\u2019Malley, the Justice Department spokesman, said the agency was \u201ccommitted to protecting the civil and constitutional rights of all individuals,\u201d adding that Mr. Sessions was \u201ccommitted to holding any officer responsible who violates the law without restraining the ability of good cops trying to do their part in reducing violent crimes.\u201dMr. O\u2019Malley declined to comment on Ville Platte because the Justice Department has not resolved the matter. It is unclear whether the department will ultimately reach a settlement with the city.While the police chief and the sheriff have said that the illegal holds have been halted, local politicians and activists are skeptical. In an interview, the chief said he saw no need to repair the community\u2019s trust.But the mayor, Jennifer Vidrine, a Democrat, said she was especially disturbed to learn that local residents had been too afraid to come forward before federal investigators arrived.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the Justice Department exists,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if they can provide the proper oversight just to make sure that people are doing things the correct way, I\u2019m for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Close-Up on Mysteries Made of Stone in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Desert", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStructures that may have been created by ancient tribes could only be studied using Google Earth. Saudi officials finally invited an archaeologist to observe them via helicopter.But he was unable to secure permission to visit the country to observe up close the ancient designs that he and amateur archaeologists had studied from their desktops.\u201cThey are absolutely astonishing,\u201d said Dr. Kennedy, who recently retired from the University of Western Australia. \u201cFrom 500 feet, you can see the vital details of structures that are invisible in the fuzzy image on Google Earth.\u201dOver the course of three days, he snapped more than 6,000 aerial photographs, lifting the veil on the ancient wonders.Since 1997, Dr. Kennedy has studied similar structures in neighboring Jordan from the ground and sky. Many of the stone figures in both countries are in basalt fields known as harrats. The fields often feature dried up lava streams that twist and turn like slithering snakes across the dark landscape.In Saudi Arabia, he explored 200 sites from the air across the regions of Harrat Khaybar and Harrat Uwayrid. The structures he observed ranged in shapes and sizes, which he describes as gates, kites, triangles, bull\u2019s eyes and keyholes.Of the 400 structures he describes as \u201cgates\u201d that he had identified on Google Earth, Dr. Kennedy studied about 40 from the helicopter and found that the structures were not randomly put together.\u201cWe could see immediately they were much more complicated than they appeared on Google Earth,\u201d Dr. Kennedy said. They were not simply heaps of stone.Rather, each long bar was actually made up of two parallel lines of flat slabs placed on their edges facing each other with small stones filling the space in between.\u201cThey are much more sophisticated than I was prepared for,\u201d he said.Some gates were larger than 1,000 feet long and 250 feet wide. He suspected the oldest may be about 9,000 years old. Though he is not sure of their purpose, he speculated they may have been used for farming purposes.Dr. Kennedy also got a closer look at about a dozen of the \u201ckites\u201d that were first discovered in the Middle East by pilots in the 1920s. These are the most famous of the Works of the Old Men, and Dr. Kennedy has identified more than 900 of them in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Harrat Khaybar.From above, they typically resemble kites with strings and tails. They are often very large, with many stretching more than a quarter-mile. Archaeologists think gazelle were corralled into the head of the kite, where the hunters would come out to kill them. Sometimes multiple kites would overlap, so that if the animals got past one funnel they would get caught in another.\u201cEssentially there was no escape,\u201d said Dr. Kennedy.The ones in Saudi Arabia looked as if they were better built than the ones in Jordan, according to Dr. Kennedy.The harrats were littered with the smaller structures he has named keyholes, wheels, triangles and bull\u2019s-eyes.Dr. Kennedy said he was surprised at how straight the lines of the triangles and keyholes were, as if the people who made them had picked out specific flat stones rather than random rocks.Each triangle was isosceles and looked like it was pointing at something. Sometimes they were directed to a bull\u2019s-eye that was about 15 feet or 150 feet away.There were also several keyhole structures, sometimes lined up together. The heads of the keyholes were almost always near-perfect circles, and the walls were about three feet high.These structures may have served some funerary or symbolic purpose. Dr. Kennedy did not date any of the structures he visited with radiocarbon testing, but he said that future groups should perform more thorough analysis.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital that somebody follows up with serious groundwork,\u201d he said.Dr. Kennedy was invited by Amr AlMadani, the chief executive officer of the Royal Commission for Al-Ula Province, which was created to safeguard some of the country\u2019s geological, historical and archaeological sites.\u201cDr. Kennedy has spent many years poring over Google Earth images, and we were able to get him much closer to the sites,\u201d said Mr. AlMadani, who joined Dr. Kennedy in the helicopter and described the experience as exciting.\u201cThinking about how life was in the Arabian Peninsula and trying to imagine the way people hunted, lived and buried the dead was very much enriching,\u201d he wrote in an email.\u201cSeeing it on Google images is one thing, but seeing it from a helicopter window from 300 feet is a totally different thing,\u201d said Don Boyer, who accompanied Dr. Kennedy.At the age of 70, Mr. Boyer is completing his doctorate in geoarchaeology and hydrology. \u201cI think I was on a high the whole time. It was just remarkable. You run out of adjectives.\u201dArchaeologists not involved in the work called it a step forward in showing the rich and complicated prehistory of the Arabian Peninsula.\u201cThe challenge now is to conduct work on the ground,\u201d he added.\u201cWhat is so critical is to do ground survey and detailed excavation work. Otherwise, archaeological sites will often time seem mysterious and enigmatic,\u201d he said in an email.\u201cNow the big and more difficult task is to document such structures on the ground to examine their function and to understand human life\u201d in the region over time, he added.___Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obamacare\u2019s Insurance Mandate Is Unpopular. So Why Not Just Get Rid of It?", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s a reason Democrats put the provision in the bill. Eliminating it would reduce insurance coverage and drive up premiums. How much is up for debate.In a bill with many unloved parts, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate has long been the most loathed.Even many of Obamacare\u2019s authors had to be talked into the mandate. As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama campaigned on a health plan that didn\u2019t punish people who went without health coverage. Mitt Romney, whose Massachusetts health reform bill was the blueprint for Obamacare, had also initially hoped for a plan without a mandate.The mandate was often compared to one support in a three-legged stool that made Obamacare work: Knock it out, and the whole apparatus would tip over, broken and useless.That was the logic that persuaded Mr. Romney to put the mandate in his health bill, and the thinking that persuaded President Obama to change his mind and put it in the Affordable Care Act. Without the mandate, the C.B.O. has said for years, premiums would spike, and millions fewer Americans would have health insurance. The budget office\u2019s most recent estimate, published last week, said that the ranks of the uninsured would rise by 13 million over 10 years, and that average premiums would be 10 percent higher than under current law.For years, conservative health care analysts have said the budget office has erred in assuming that the insurance requirement has so much power over who gets health insurance. Under the budget office\u2019s estimates, eliminating the mandate doesn\u2019t just drive people out of the individual insurance market, where people pay premiums to buy coverage; it also sharply lowers the number of people enrolled in Medicaid, a program that low-income Americans can access largely without cost to them. Republican critics have said that the Medicaid estimates are unrealistic and unfair to any health reform plan that doesn\u2019t include a mandate.And it appears the budget office has, indeed, heard their complaints. In the recent report, its economists indicated that the office was re-evaluating its assessment of the mandate. \u201cThe agencies have undertaken considerable work to revise their methods to estimate the effects of repealing the individual mandate,\u201d the report notes near its end. While that work was not completed in time to assess the current tax proposal, new estimates should be ready soon. Under the new model, \u201cthe estimated effects on the budget and health insurance coverage would probably be smaller than the numbers reported in this document,\u201d the report says. That will make the mandate less central to the success of future health care overhaul ideas. And less valuable as a means to pay for tax cuts.Advertisement"}

O\u2019Neill, detailed a preliminary timeline of the violence, which he called an \u201cact of terror,\u201d in a news conference Tuesday evening that shed light on the scene.The white truck entered the bicycle path alongside West Street by Houston Street at 3:05 p.m. and drove south, hitting pedestrians and cyclists along the way. The runaway truck, labeled with Home Depot logos, drove 20 blocks before ramming into a school bus at Chambers Street. Two adults and two children who were on the bus were reportedly injured in the crash.The 29-year-old man driving the truck exited the vehicle with what appeared to be two handguns, Mr. O\u2019Neill said, at which point a uniformed police officer approached the man and shot him in the abdomen. Early reports suggested that the assailant may have yelled \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d Arabic for \u201cGod is great,\u201d at some point after exiting his vehicle. A paintball gun and a pellet gun were recovered from the scene later.Many of the children attending schools in the area were horror-struck.The mother of a 13-year-old girl who came face to face with the suspect said her daughter was \u201ctoo traumatized\u201d to talk. The woman, her daughter and two other children were being escorted from the scene by a police officer. She did not want to give her name or her child\u2019s name for security reasons, she said. The girl\u2019s face was red and tear-streaked, and she had curled her hands into the sleeves of her blue hooded sweatshirt. Her mother said she was a student at Intermediate School 289 on Warren Street, yards from where the truck came to a rest after crashing into the school bus.\u201cShe was right in front of the shooter. He had two guns,\u201d the woman said of her daughter.

Around 50 more soon joined.As Olivia and her friends ran inside, students on the upper floors of Stuyvesant had been shooting video of what happened in the street. Videos posted on Facebook and then circulated over Snapchat showed what appeared to be the suspect, a bearded man in dark clothing heading down the street with his weapons in his hands, next to a white pickup truck.A series of diagrams show points where victims were hit during the attack.Adria Menezes, 45, said she saw the suspect firing one of his weapons at cars on West Street.Ms. Menezes had just arrived at Public School 89, which shares space with I.S. 289 on Warren Street, at 3:03 p.m. to pick up the two children she babysits for, when she suddenly heard cars crashing on West Street and saw a yellow school bus \u201cdrive like crazy.\u201dThen roughly 15 feet away, she saw a tall man with dark hair and wearing a hat.

I will go a step further and say the last few years \u2014 as we have engaged in these subjects with respect and civility and have not really taken a political position, just tried to elevate the national discourse \u2014 our business has not been affected negatively on any level, even after we attempted to raise the level of national discourse on race, which I think we should talk about.No. So once again, where we are thinking as a company: What is our role and responsibility in raising the national conversation about things that we think are important? There\u2019s a lack of truth, there\u2019s a lack of authenticity and as a result of that we are trying to elevate a conversation that\u2019s just based on the fact that we want to be authentic.When it comes to making progress in corporate diversity, companies don\u2019t seem to be attacking the issue aggressively. What we hear is, \u201cWe\u2019re working on it.\u201dI always tell people there are 300 million Americans. I guarantee there is someone out there capable of tackling or being trained to fill basically every job. And I\u2019ve heard all the excuses.Not long ago, someone actually said to me, \u201cBlack people don\u2019t want to move to Phoenix.\u201d Now, the last time I checked, black people and all people welcome the opportunity to work with smart people for good pay. Trust me, Phoenix is not a deal-breaker.It\u2019s also been shown that employers expect more of minority candidates. We aren\u2019t allowed to just be good, we must be exceptional.Where we haven\u2019t been great is showing the interpretations of our policies as it pertains to enforcement. And we work really hard to make sure that we are listening to voices, and specifically the journalists on our platform, to determine newsworthiness, and to determine what is public interest and what\u2019s not public interest. In some cases, we\u2019re going to get it wrong. But as our peers have said, like, this is something that is evolving, this is something that\u2019s moving very, very fast. I wouldn\u2019t give us a high grade at the moment, but we do have the intention internally in the company to fix that.My goal is to make sure that we are building something that outlives me, and that endures, and that continues to serve generations beyond me. And that means I need to build structures that aren\u2019t dependent entirely upon me. That means I need to recognize leaders who can succeed me. That means we need to get our decision-making rigor and process and understanding into the very DNA of our companies.I said I\u2019m considering running for president. I think that given the circumstances there\u2019s a unique opportunity for somebody like me who\u2019s independent, who\u2019s not affiliated with a party in any way. I haven\u2019t given money to a politician since 2002 and I think that people are looking for an independent voice, a real independent voice, that at least has an inkling of what they\u2019re talking about.People are tired of politicians and the things that politicians do, and whether it\u2019s me, Bob Iger, Howard Schultz, somebody else, I think there\u2019s a door that\u2019s wide open and I think somebody who doesn\u2019t have a deep affiliation with either party or with politicians has an even greater opportunity.I met with 15, no, it ended up being eight, Democratic senators yesterday in D.C. to talk about health care, so I try to get a better understanding. To me, you can\u2019t absorb enough knowledge and you can\u2019t connect with people enough, and so I don\u2019t want to just limit myself to one silo. I don\u2019t want to be in a bubble.The reason why I\u2019m considering \u2014 haven\u2019t committed \u2014 is because I\u2019ve got three kids. What caring, loving parent would put an 8-, 11- and 14-year-old child through this?There\u2019s a lot of ways to have an impact and the more in tune I am, the more connected, the more educated I am about a variety of topics. the easier it is for me to decide.I was a federal prosecutor for more than a decade and was looking to leave the government, but I still wanted to be doing something that I thought was socially impactful. So I went into Facebook through a legal job and hadn\u2019t been there too long when the company approached me about taking over the policy world. Basically what this means is setting the rules for what people can share on Facebook. So, what can you post, what can you advertise?And over time, this has grown into a community where now we have people in countries all over the world, more than 85 percent of the people that are using Facebook are outside the United States. So it\u2019s this really global community where when we\u2019re setting these policies for what people can share we have to be thinking about what does it look like in, you know, in Turkey? What does it look like in Australia? And craft our rules accordingly.We\u2019re not at the point where we say we\u2019ve got it all figured out and here\u2019s how speech should be on social media. We\u2019re sort of learning as the community grows, how people talk about social and political issues right now. What we do is we say we allow people to come to Facebook to discuss what\u2019s important to them, that\u2019s why we exist.The initial response that I gave under my name was wrong. Period. I own that, and it was one of those moments where you felt compelled to respond quickly as it was escalating on social media. It was a combination, as it always tends to be, a mixture of folks in your ear telling you what to say.It was not what I felt, certainly, and I should have gone with my gut instinct. And at the end of the day when you sit in the offices that we sit in, there\u2019s no one behind you. And so what I felt, what I saw, I should have said so and moved forward from that perspective. That was probably the biggest learning in that regard. There was only one United employee effectively involved in the whole process. It was not their fault. We let the policies and procedures of a mega-operating safety-oriented organization get in the way of simple human values. No one should be treated like that.From my point of view I\u2019ve just been doing the work for 20 years, and a lot of the issues that we\u2019ve been working on are issues of our day. And they\u2019re getting much more prominent. And the work that we\u2019ve been doing is starting to accumulate. But, you know, being on the inside it seems like I just keep doing the same thing I\u2019ve been doing.So the media portfolio came through because we built out a muscle. Because we\u2019re in the social change sector, and when you\u2019re in that sector you have to also look at behavior, and identity, and the cultural narrative. And so that\u2019s why we started doing our own comm stuff, and then we started looking at media, and we realized that if you\u2019re not part of the cultural conversation you could work your entire life trying to, in a Sisyphean way, move things forward and be crushed if you don\u2019t connect with people at the heart-and-mind level.We also believe in the importance of free and unfettered press and media, and its role in our democracy. And we know the business model is weakened, and we also feel that that kind of shoring up and that kind of belief, and the kind of patient capital that we can bring to media companies, is essential for the health and well-being of our democracy. So it\u2019s also as Americans we think it\u2019s really important.I think there\u2019s a trend going on which says clothes are just not that important or as important as they were. And if you go through the audience \u2014 and I always do this at the office when I went to the office every day \u2014 is how old is what you\u2019re wearing, and what\u2019s the latest trend in the world, and what\u2019s this, that and the other thing?I used to call shopping centers the local villages, but you don\u2019t have to go to the village to see other people if you\u2019re on your device because that\u2019s the new way of meeting and seeing and having relationships.I think it\u2019s O.K. to buy clothes, wear them for a night. Someone said to me yesterday that, well, I\u2019m renting clothes by the month, and why should I even buy clothes anymore? So I think clothes don\u2019t play the same role in one\u2019s life as they used to.I mean, you have to sometimes face the reality that something is not gonna grow and it might be going like this, and maybe that\u2019s the state of the retail business.And then what really triggered it for me was Ken [Frazier of Merck] left the council, and when Ken left, when I saw him leave and it became very politicized, and I said, that\u2019s not what I want to be a part of. This is not now something that\u2019s really focused on just manufacturing, it\u2019s becoming more political.It\u2019s a good relationship but it also comes with balance and that\u2019s what I told Travis very early on, is that any new C.E.O. needs space and needs that from the old C.E.O. And so I told him very early on, \u201cTravis, I\u2019m actually gonna be pushing you away early on because I need my space.\u201d I need to be able to meet with a team. I need to be able to communicate with them so that they\u2019re just communicating with me and they don\u2019t have someone to go around if they don\u2019t like something that they\u2019ve heard, etc. So you\u2019ve got to let me engage with the team, engage with a company, engage with the culture.And I was a little worried about that conversation. But, actually, he took it really well and he\u2019s been very respectful, and at the same time he\u2019s been available to me whenever I\u2019ve needed him.Pairing that with the Turner advertising inventory is a really powerful thing. We believe that is what we aspire to do. Selling CNN makes no sense in that context if that\u2019s the business you\u2019re trying to build. So to suggest that I would be interested in selling CNN just doesn\u2019t make sense.I will state again, I\u2019m not selling CNN and AT&T is not selling CNN.I personally think that where we are right now in the world of advertising and media is that there are a couple of players who have built incredibly strong positions and impressive positions in advertising and they are technology companies and I believe that if we are going to compete \u2014 if somebody is going to compete \u2014 with them the best opportunity we have is somebody like AT&T.We have a very strong global economy. I must say, though, prices are more extreme now. So much of corporate profitability is validating the stock market valuations. But we have risen three-plus multiple points, so, you know, we\u2019re not extreme prices but we\u2019re certainly not cheap.But let\u2019s be clear \u2014 the market dynamics are good. We\u2019re being tested as management teams and boards making sure we\u2019re doing the right thing. I do believe we have lost focus and there is too much short-termism, but I think it\u2019s going to be hard. As Ken Chenault suggested, long term is only two years, and I think that\u2019s the equal system we\u2019re all working in. And I would say long term for Washington is about six weeks. So we\u2019re living in a world where everything has been truncated to smaller components of time.I think over all the consumer is in pretty good shape. I think as we all understand we\u2019re not talking about a robust economy. But what is interesting, if you look around the world, the economy has been relatively stable in a range of markets.I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happened for quite a while, and if you\u2019d asked me a year ago how would you feel, I would have told you I\u2019ve got concerns in this region and in this region. And we\u2019re at a point in time where, in fact, things are holding up pretty well.That said, what you\u2019re seeing is a demarcation in performance because there are some companies \u2014 in fact, many companies \u2014 that have not been able to take advantage of the stability, and, in fact, were banking on seeing an improvement in the economy. And so the consumer is there, certainly spending, we\u2019re certainly seeing that on our cards. They certainly want experiences. They like to travel and we\u2019re seeing from a millennial perspective a strong interest both in our products and services but also experiences in travel. I\u2019m not going to predict what the holiday season is going to be, but what I would say is we\u2019ve been very encouraged about the spending.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Wine Books to Give This Holiday Season", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThe fascination with wine begins with the land, which year after year has the potential to produce something different and original from the same vineyard.So it is with wine writers, who each year plow more or less the same terrain, finding novel and provocative ways of presenting their material. Here are five of the most interesting books on wine that were published in 2017, which would make excellent gifts for friends, loved ones or yourself.In transparent prose, Mr. Liem looks back on the winemaking history of the region, which has been obscured in effervescent mythology. He makes a compelling case for the historic importance of place and terroir in Champagne, a departure from decades of marketing that focused on the cellar work of master blenders rather than on the land.While the recent story of Champagne is often framed in terms of simple, black-and-white trends \u2014 the triumph of small farmers, who also produce wines, over the big Champagne houses; the rise of the extra brut and brut nature styles; the increasing importance of single-vineyard Champagnes \u2014 Mr. Liem never settles for the easy conclusion.For Mr. Liem, an American who lives in Champagne, the increasing exploration and understanding of the region\u2019s terroirs is the crucial element in improving the wine and deepening our comprehension of it. But that does not mean, he insists, that a Burgundy-style shift to producing microscopic expressions of the land is in the best interests of the wine or the producers. Nor does he countenance any of the various trends as intrinsic improvements. He is admirably unbiased and authoritative.The history is illuminating, as is the section describing individual growers and houses. Yet the beating heart of the book is a careful examination of Champagne\u2019s terroir, village by village and almost plot by plot. This is enhanced by Mr. Liem\u2019s discovery and reproduction of intricate 1940s-era maps of Champagne, demonstrating that the understanding of the land is not something new, but something old that is being rediscovered.These maps are included as a separate element of a boxed set, a packaging decision that explains the $80 list price. Nonetheless, this is a welcome, essential guide that succeeds in transporting our understanding of Champagne into the 21st century.Ms. Feiring, who has written numerous books on natural wine, and Ms. Lepeltier, a leading sommelier, survey the various geological formations on which the most distinctive wines are grown. Whether granite, limestone, basalt, shale, gravel, slate or clay, each, they argue, imparts consistent characteristics when matched with the proper grapes, particularly when carefully and conscientiously farmed.The link between soil and wine, they acknowledge, is not clearly understood by scientists. Indeed, some scientists reject it, preferring to focus on climate as the most important factor for growing grapes. Yet anyone who has ever compared the chardonnay grown in the Kimmeridgian limestone of Chablis with any other grown elsewhere can\u2019t help but think that soil must play a crucial role in shaping the distinctive qualities of that wine. I certainly do.This book is not intended as a scientific treatise. It\u2019s more a once-over-lightly juxtaposition of soil types and wine characteristics, along with a look at the grapes that thrive in each type of soil and suggestions of wine producers to seek out. Still, it is exhilarating to apply this paradigm to wine, even in a decidedly general way.Ms. Feiring is occasionally prone to eye-rolling self-absorption \u2014 asserting, for example, that she wasn\u2019t the first to discover Barolo, which is a little like reminding people that she didn\u2019t discover fire \u2014 and to unconvincing statements that seem primarily ideological, as in a wholesale rejection of first-growth Bordeaux since 1986. This book, though, is an important and useful challenge to think about wine in a different way.To that end he has enumerated 89 \u201crules\u201d (perhaps a more marketable term than \u201csuggestions\u201d) in no particular order, with the goal of helping consumers to relax and to better discern between what is important and what is not.How to select a wine, how to serve it, how to store it, how to pair it with food: These are among the topics that many consumers find so challenging. Mr. Bonn\u00e9 succeeds in extracting the answers from decades of overwrought expert instruction and presenting them in a clear, easygoing mannerThis is not a reference work. It has no index. Rather, it is a Zen-like reminder that wine is a joy, not a chore; a journey, not a race. Beginners and even confident wine drinkers will find much of value, even leafing through rules at random.\u201cIn Vino\u201d examines the story of Rudy Kurniawan, a wine collector of mysterious wealth and origin, who fooled a coterie of even wealthier collectors along with covetous hangers-on, bilking them all with fraudulent bottles of rare, old wines, many of which he created in his kitchen.Mr. Hellman, a veteran journalist who covered the case, allows the story to unfold with spare prose. He presents, without overt judgment, the macho, competitive, one-upmanship world of the collectors, an atmosphere that perhaps contributed to their gullibility in the high-rolling economy of the early 2000s. This, along with the desperation to possess, seemed a greater motivation among these collectors than an actual love of wine.While Mr. Kurniawan is currently serving a prison sentence, Mr. Hellman acknowledges that many unanswered questions remain. How exactly did the forger accumulate his nest egg? Could he really have been working alone? And for anyone about to open a bottle of expensive, old wine, is it real?Ms. Anson, a contributing editor at Decanter, the British wine magazine, briefly outlines these agricultural and winemaking philosophies and offers capsule profiles of wine producers and their bottles. Her taste is exceptional, and while she at times retreats to the sort of winemaking jargon that you would typically find in a wine-oriented publication, general-interest readers will profit as well.Purists might complain about some of her entries, but I find the absence of rigidity refreshing. The producers she cites, and their ways of thinking, will have you drinking better in no time.Advertisement"}

More galling, perhaps, was the implicit rebuke to their own collective marital-bed deaths. (That Ms. Waldman and Mr. Chabon had a rocking sex life may have been the greater transgression.)In coffee shops, parenting chat rooms and the studios of daytime television, Ms. Waldman was reviled as a combination of Britney Spears, Susan Smith and Medea, with a bit of Anna Karenina thrown in for good measure. Much of the opprobrium spewed from one source, \u201cNew York City\u2019s elite Bad Mother SWAT team, the warrior-shrews of UrbanBaby.com,\u201d as Ms. Waldman wrote later, referring to the cacophonous parenting site and its voluble members, who \u201csank their pointy little incisors into my metaphorical ankles.\u201dAnd the invective just kept coming. Ms. Waldman found a note on the gate of her family\u2019s Berkeley house, threatening to turn her in to social services; Star Jones took her down on \u201cThe View\u201d and Gawker began a gleeful, decade-long ribbing of the Waldman-Chabon marriage.\u201cIt was scary and it was unpleasant,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThe worst part of it was that I didn\u2019t get to plug my books. Not only that, but if you clicked on my name on Oprah\u2019s website, you went to somebody else\u2019s author page on Amazon. I really did not want to go on Oprah and talk about my sex life, but I really wanted to sell books. When does the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the literary novelist abate?\u201dStill, the essay would make her famous. Not a bad thing, Ms. Waldman admitted, for a Harvard Law School-educated former public defender who was trying to make it as a novelist and whose oeuvre at the time was a lighthearted, if not widely read, series of murder mysteries starring a former public defender turned stay-at-home mom and amateur sleuth. (She had just written a more serious novel, however, \u201cDaughter\u2019s Keeper,\u201d that explored the relationship between a mother and a daughter who faces prosecution for her connection to a drug deal; it was that book she had hoped to hawk on \u201cOprah.\u201d) That all changed, post-essay, when Ms Waldman was instantly anointed as a parenting expert, the go-to apologist for maternal ambivalence. (She did feel she\u2019d hit a wall, career-wise, when she found herself giving tips about traveling with children to Katie Couric on \u201cToday.\u201d)\u201cBad Mother: A Chronicle of Maternal Crimes, Minor Calamities and Occasional Moments of Grace,\u201d out in 2009, was an affecting if gentle memoir \u2014 as a reviewer at Jezebel noted, it delivered more misdemeanors than actual crimes, along with a heartbreaking essay about terminating a pregnancy \u2014 that would become a New York Times best seller.\u201cI still stand by my essay, and my children do, too,\u201d Ms. Waldman said. Not that they\u2019ve read it. They are just aware, in a general if bored way, she said, of its contention that there\u2019s a distinction between romantic and maternal love. If she has any regrets, Ms. Waldman said, these center on how her \u201chumble-brag,\u201d as she put it, would dog her. \u201cLooking back,\u201d she said, \u201cit was a little smug.\u201d She never reckoned she would be answering questions about her sex life for the next decade \u2014 and beyond.(Sorry, said this reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Ms. Waldman said.)\u201cThe essay was both a gift and a curse,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt gave me the opportunity to have a career that I don\u2019t know that I would have had. But when I wanted to write something different\u201d \u2014 when she wanted to leave the mommy track, as it were \u2014 \u201ceveryone was like, \u2018Wait a minute. You\u2019re the lady that likes her husband.\u2019\u201dOn the upside, she pointed out, in 2005, Twitter had not yet been invented. Facebook was still a social network used only by college students. \u201cI was really lucky, because this happened before the worst of the internet,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you imagine if that happened now? I would not have survived.\u201dAnd what of the children? What indignities have they suffered since their mother\u2019s confessional? Sophie, the eldest child, is now 23; Abraham, the youngest, is 14.\u201cHere is what happened,\u201d Ms. Waldman said. \u201cYears ago, Sophie read \u2018The Mysteries of Pittsburgh\u2019\u201d \u2014 Mr. Chabon\u2019s best-selling first novel \u2014 \u201cor she read part of it, and she was like, \u2018Dad, there\u2019s too much sex.\u2019\u201d Sophie \u201cbasically issued a family fatwa against our books, though an exception was made for \u2018Summerland,\u2019\u201d Ms. Waldman said, referring to Mr. Chabon\u2019s young adult novel, published in 2002.\u201cBut they don\u2019t really read our work,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t care.\u201dAs for her sex life, Ms. Waldman answered the inevitable question patiently. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, thank you,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cJust a constant Cirque du Soleil.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time to Tax Companies for Using Our Personal Data", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur data is valuable. Each year, it generates hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of economic activity, mostly between and within corporations \u2014 all on the back of information about each of us.It\u2019s this transaction \u2014 between you, the user, giving up details of yourself to a company in exchange for a product like a photo app or email, or a whole ecosystem like Facebook \u2014 that\u2019s worth by some estimates $1,000 per person per year, a number that is quickly rising.The value of our personal data is primarily locked up in the revenues of large corporations. Some, like data brokerages, exist solely to buy and sell sets of that data.Why should companies be the major, and often the only, beneficiaries of this largess? They shouldn\u2019t. Those financial benefits need to be shared, and the best way to do it is to impose a small tax on this revenue and use the proceeds to build a better, more equitable internet and society that benefit us all.The data tax could be a minor cost, less than 1 percent of the revenue companies earn from selling our personal data, spread out over an entire industry. Individually, no company\u2019s bottom line would substantially suffer; collectively, the tax would pull money back to the public, from an industry profiting from material and labor that is, at its very core, our own.This idea is not new. It is, essentially, a sales tax, among the oldest taxes that exist, but it hasn\u2019t been done because assigning a fixed monetary value to our data can be very difficult. For a lot of internet businesses, our personal data either primarily flows through the business or remains locked within.The flow-through type of business is an internet provider, like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon; the latter is a platform provider, like Facebook or Twitter. Google mostly makes platforms, like its search function and Gmail, but it also lays fiber-optic cable, providing the internet to some municipalities. The company also is making self-driving cars.It\u2019s perhaps easiest to consider your data as something real and physical, like a car, which, in a sense, it is. It moves around a real, physical infrastructure, owned and operated by the internet providers, and the information is also stored \u2014 or parked \u2014 on millions of hard drives in vast buildings in usually cold climes. These are owned and operated by the platform makers, including Amazon, which has a very lucrative arm that does nothing but rent out its server space.When you use the internet, your information travels through the providers\u2019 pipes (roads) and into and out of the platform makers\u2019 servers (parking lots). For the most part, the platform makers rely on your data to improve their products. Google uses its immense trove of real human searches to make better artificial intelligence like transcriptions, translations and self-driving cars.How much, exactly, these new and innovative businesses are worth is unclear even to Google. But it, and all the platform makers, don\u2019t just improve products with our data. The companies invite advertisers into the platforms, offering to deliver advertisements to exactly the right kind of person, at exactly the right time, based off the platform makers\u2019 intimate knowledge of us, via our data. The internet providers are less nuanced: We pay a monthly fee for access to the pipes the companies lay and the upkeep on them, but the companies also sell our data to brokers, who bundle and sell it to advertisers.It\u2019s this data brokerage industry that should be the primary, initial focus of the data tax. This industry exists solely to collect our information and sell it as a commodity to retailers, advertisers, marketers, even other data brokerages and government agencies.It\u2019s this marketplace that traffics in the actual monetary value of our data, and from it we can begin to map just how much that data might be worth overall.Microlevies like this one have been issued successfully before. Over the last decade, the governments of 10 countries, including Chile, France and Niger, have successfully raised more than 1 billion euros in funding from a tax on airline tickets of \u20ac1 to \u20ac40 depending on the class of ticket.The money generated has gone toward global H.I.V./AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria eradication programs. In Austria, the government was considering imposing a value-added tax on the big data transactions of social media companies that benefit from personal data, but has been stymied by the complications of assigning a fixed value to such transactions.Our data is ours, but it also is not ours. We trade it away for so much of our experience on the internet.

In recent days, its members have made an orchestrated attempt to focus the attention of the country \u2014 and of powerful social media platforms like Facebook \u2014 on a misinformation campaign that they believe is devised to damage one of the last major center-left governments standing in Europe.Mr. Renzi, a wily political operator who partly blames online misinformation campaigns and fake news for the failure of a referendum that forced his resignation in December, is not only seeking to protect himself, but also to go on the offensive.Mr. Renzi is making the issue central to his own Facebook posts and a conference he will kick off in Florence on Friday evening to call attention to the issue.Davide Colono, a member of the family that managed the sites, said the content was merely intended to attract clicks in a country fed up with the Democratic Party\u2019s government. He called the shuttering of the sites \u201cagainst the freedom of the press\u201d and \u201cjust politics.\u201dFacebook representatives have told Italian officials that they are planning to dispatch an Italian \u201ctask force\u201d of fact-checkers to address the fake-news problem here before the elections, according to a government official who was present during the negotiations but was not authorized to speak on the record.Facebook declined to comment on Friday about those plans.Mr. Stroppa has also prepared a report for Mr. Renzi that attempts to demonstrate a connection between seemingly unrelated sites promoting rival anti-establishment political movements critical of Mr. Renzi and the center-left government.The report, which Mr. Stroppa shared with The New York Times, shows that the official web page of a movement promoting Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League party, shares unique Google codes with a fan and propaganda page supportive of the Five Star Movement.The codes, used to track advertising and web traffic, are also shared by an array of other sites, some of which spread wild conspiracy theories, attack Mr. Renzi or deliver explicitly pro-Russian spin.The assorted sites share a unique ID assigned by Google Analytics to keep track of how a site is performing, as well as an AdSense number through which Google manages advertisements placed on the sites, according to data in Mr. Stroppa\u2019s report and verified by The Times.All the sites also share a template on their contact pages. But in the murky world of internet propaganda and subterfuge, the tilt of the content is clearer than where it originates, and what the shared codes amount to is not entirely clear.\u201cWe frequently see unrelated sites using the same IDs, so that\u2019s not a reliable indicator that two sites are connected,\u201d said a Google spokeswoman, Simona Panseri.Some analysts, however, noted that the ad revenues would flow to the same operator and suggested that the assigning of separate site ID numbers indicated the hand of a single manager, who could then easily track traffic and metrics.Google would not identify the site administrators. Emails sent to addresses listed on the contact pages of the sites went unanswered.Chris Norton, a spokesman for Facebook, said, \u201cWe take the issue of fake news incredibly seriously.\u201d And he added that the company considered the issue of accurate information on the platform \u201cespecially important during elections.\u201dHe said it was disrupting the economic incentives for false news, removing fake accounts and investing in resources and technology to address the problem. But Facebook declined to identify the administrator of the accounts with the shared Google codes.A spokesman for the Five Star Movement said the fan page in question that shared the codes was not an official site and could have been made by an independent activist.Asked about the shared codes between his official web page and the page promoting the Five Star Movement, Francesco Zicchieri, a leader of the \u201cWe\u2019re With Salvini\u201d movement, appeared legitimately bewildered.\u201cI don\u2019t even know what we are talking about,\u201d he said, adding that the party\u2019s web guru, Luca Morisi \u201cdoes everything\u201d for the movement\u2019s assorted sites.Late Friday evening Mr. Morisi acknowledged that the site We\u2019re With Salvini shared the same Google codes as sites outside the League\u2019s political universe. He explained that a former supporter of the Five Star Movement had helped build the We\u2019re With Salvini site and pasted codes from his Five Star fan page, as well as I\u2019m With Putin and his conspiracy sites, onto the official page.\u201cBut we have nothing to do with the pro-Putin or pro-Five Star sites,\u201d Mr. Morisi said, explaining that he thought he had actually changed the codes in the past and promised to do so this weekend to clear up any confusion.The League and the Five Star Movement are not nominally allied, and even cast themselves as rivals. But they share an interest in advancing the pro-Russia, anti-establishment and anti-immigrant agenda that has made Five Star the most popular party in Italy.Five Star says it has sworn off any coalition alliances, but Mr. Salvini recently indicated that he would be open to forming a coalition.Mr. Salvini\u2019s party signed a cooperation agreement in March 2017 with Mr. Putin\u2019s United Russia Party, and Mr. Salvini, who uses xenophobic and anti-Muslim language, has repeatedly praised Mr. Putin as an ally against Islamic terrorism.The Five Star Movement has hosted on its associated websites anti-Renzi propaganda originating on Russian outlets such as Sputnik or RT.\u201cWe are at a crossroads,\u201d said Mr. Renzi, who, for now, stopped short of pointing a finger directly at Russia for interference in Italy\u2019s coming election, which he cast as a choice between growth and instability.The former prime minister said he had no proof of Russian involvement, and worried that raising the specter of Mr. Putin could become a reason \u201cto not do anything\u201d when Facebook now has the ability to close pages infected by apparently homegrown fake news.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to evoke the Russian danger,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen there is proof in our hands.\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Woman After Woman Accuses Roy Moore of Misconduct, One Leads His Defense", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2014 With the furor over sexual misconduct allegations against Roy S. Moore only growing, it was his wife, Kayla Moore, who was at center stage on the Alabama Capitol steps on Friday, her gold cross earrings glinting in the sun as she defiantly defended her husband.\u201cLet me set the record straight,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cHe will not step down.\u201dAs Mr. Moore wages a two-front battle against the accusations by nine women of sexual misconduct and unwanted advances, and against Washington Republicans who want nothing more than for him to exit the race for an Alabama Senate seat, the limelight is shining on his most prominent defender: his wife.Over 32 years of marriage, Ms. Moore has been a constant, if reserved, part of her husband\u2019s public life.Take the time in August, when as Mr. Moore spoke at a Baptist church in Jasper, Ala., Ms. Moore discreetly rose from the last pew and set up a card table in the sanctuary with pamphlets and copies of the candidate\u2019s books.\u201cKayla is a quiet presence in the background and does not inject herself vocally into politics,\u201d said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, a law firm in Florida, who represented Mr. Moore after he resisted same-sex marriage.But now, Mr. Staver said, she has become \u201cmore vocal because her husband has been attacked.\u201dMs. Moore is no stranger to public life, becoming the president of the Foundation for Moral Law, an organization founded by Mr. Moore, in 2013. Two years later, she ran for secretary of the Alabama Republican Party, but was soundly defeated by Lynn Robinson.But Angi Horn Stalnaker, a Republican political strategist in Alabama, said she was still something of a cipher, politically speaking.\u201cThere is less known about Kayla Moore\u2019s hobbies and likes and dislikes and personality than there is about any other political spouse in Alabama,\u201d Ms. Stalnaker said.The couple met in 1984. The same year, Ms. Moore filed for divorce from her first husband. Just over 12 months later, she married Mr. Moore. She was 24, 14 years his junior. Around Gadsden, where Mr. Moore worked as a lawyer and a judge, the couple are known as Roy and Kayla \u2014 no last name necessary.A biography of her on the website of the political organization that she runs describes Ms. Moore as a former beauty pageant contender who studied at Jacksonville State University and the University of Alabama.The site says that she worked for many years as a bookkeeper, and became Mr. Moore\u2019s legal secretary after they were married. It also says that she played key roles in each of his political campaigns.The foundation was the subject of a complaint filed to the Internal Revenue Service in September, accusing the group of \u201crepeatedly and expressly\u201d advocating Mr. Moore\u2019s election to the Senate, in conflict with its tax-exempt status. Mr. Moore says the criticism is politically motivated.The Washington Post reported last month that internal documents showed Mr. Moore received a salary of $180,000 a year for his part-time work for the foundation. He was given a $540,000 mortgage on the group\u2019s headquarters when it was unable to pay that salary in full, the report said.\u201cShe didn\u2019t hesitate,\u201d said Randy Brinson, the president of the Christian Coalition of Alabama and a prominent Republican in the state who spoke to the couple by phone last weekend. \u201cI think she\u2019s just coming forward to stand by him and defend him, just like any spouse would.\u201dBy Friday, Ms. Moore had stepped fully into the role of the defender, speaking after a group of other Republican women. They framed the allegations of sexual misconduct as part of a plot to overthrow their political goals, which ranged from repealing the Affordable Care Act to fighting against same-sex marriage.\u201cConsider the source,\u201d Ms. Moore said, urging Alabamians to join her in standing by her husband. \u201cTo the people of Alabama, thank you for being smarter than they think you are.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roy Moore, Long Divisive in His Hometown, and Even More So Now", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGADSDEN, Ala. \u2014 Delores Abney, 63, a retired domestic violence counselor, said she and her husband had heard things about Roy Moore and his interest in younger women for years.On Monday night, Ms. Abney said she recalled Mr. Moore, the embattled Republican Senate candidate, being a regular presence in the mid-1980s at the Y.M.C.A. There, she said, he was often talking to much younger women \u2014 women that \u201cappeared to be high school on up,\u201d she said \u2014 in an exercise class she was enrolled in. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he was trying to pick them up. It just did not look appropriate.\u201d\u201cI truly believe these women,\u201d Ms. Abney added of the women who have come forward to accuse him of misconduct in recent days. \u201cThis type of behavior is highly unacceptable and deplorable in our leaders.\u201dBut the Abneys are also Democrats and longtime critics of Mr. Moore and his hard-line take on Christian values. The emergence on Monday of a new accuser, who said Mr. Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16, only cemented their views of him. Etowah County, the largely rural slice of northeast Alabama where Mr. Moore was raised and currently lives, was bitterly divided about Mr. Moore before the allegations. And it remains so now.Rumors that once simmered at a low level of his interest in young women, which was mostly deemed moderately creepy rather than criminal, are now clogging Facebook feeds, dominating talk at fast-food restaurants and generating endless gossip.Mr. Moore, many people say, clearly had a fondness for younger women in decades past. When he got married to his wife, Kayla, in 1985, he was 38 and she was 24. But around Gadsden, a city of 36,000 in the foothills along the Coosa River, opinions about the recent allegations tend to follow lines that were etched long before.\u201cI simply cannot believe it,\u201d said Albert Morgan, 92, a retired pastor who was sitting down to a meal of chicken and potatoes to celebrate his daughter\u2019s birthday. \u201cHe went to West Point, and then he was in the Vietnam War. He\u2019s very intelligent. I\u2019ve always admired and respected him.\u201dMr. Morgan\u2019s daughter, Sheila Christian, who had just turned 68, said she was deeply suspicious of the accusers.\u201cLet\u2019s look at these people\u2019s past,\u201d Ms. Christian, who works in a doctor\u2019s office, said. \u201cRoy Moore \u2014 if he did it, that\u2019s between him and God.\u201dMr. Moore, in a campaign stop in South Alabama on Tuesday night, made only limited reference to the scandal that has put his campaign at grave risk.\u201cAfter fortysomething years of fighting this battle, I\u2019m now facing allegations, and that\u2019s all the press want to talk about,\u201d Mr. Moore said at a hymn-filled revival in Jackson, about an hour\u2019s drive north of Mobile. \u201cI want to talk about the issues. I want to talk about where this country\u2019s going, and if we don\u2019t come back to God, we\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201dBut most of Mr. Moore\u2019s words were ones he has repeated for years on the campaign trail, and before Mr. Moore clutched a microphone in South Alabama, some of his supporters made clear that they would continue to back him.\u201cI pray for him daily,\u201d said the Rev. Mike Allison, a pastor at a church in Madison, Ala. \u201cAnd as he\u2019s facing attacks that would completely crush most men. Really, the weight on me is so minuscule compared to what he has to face every day.\u201dGadsden, his hometown, has a long blue-collar history, sustained for most of the last century by textile mills, a steel mill \u2014 now closed \u2014 and a tire-manufacturing plant. It is also a city of churchgoers.But it is not a well of unfettered support for Mr. Moore. In a runoff for the Republican Senate nomination in September, Mr. Moore won 57 percent of the vote in the county \u2014 less than he earned in 42 of Alabama\u2019s other 66 counties. It is easier to find signs for his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, than for Mr. Moore.But even in a place that has long been polarized over Mr. Moore, there are hints of nagging doubt among his supporters, and admissions by critics that they still want more clarity about the allegations.Mr. Moore\u2019s campaign has denied that he engaged in \u201cany sexual misconduct with anyone.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see him backing down,\u201d said Wanda Fugatt, 48, who works at a store along Broad Street. The timing of all this was fishy, she said, and the accusers would have been more believable if they had come forward six months earlier. She said she hopes that Mr. Moore wins and she did not think he would step out of the race, as many Republican leaders have called on him to do. Unless.\u201cUnless he is sitting there completely guilty, knowing that he\u2019s completely guilty,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I say he may take himself out of the race. But not yet. No, it ain\u2019t time yet.\u201dThose who insist they are not politically aligned with Mr. Moore have their own questions about the recent allegations.\u201cI think it\u2019s a little weird that they\u2019re coming up 40 years later and making these accusations.\u201d said B.J. Morris, 79, a retired professor on her way out of a Chick-fil-A. Still, she said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s true.\u201dKathy Fowler, who processes tax credits and who was smoking a cigarette outside of a pub as darkness fell on Monday night, said the newest accuser had made her even more sure of Mr. Moore\u2019s guilt.\u201cIf it was one, I might question it,\u201d she said. \u201cNow they\u2019re popping up. One did a news conference \u2014 that holds a lot of ground with me.\u201dLike many here, her decision about whether or not to support Mr. Moore was already made.\u201cHe\u2019s not going to get my vote,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t going to get it anyway.\u201dBilly Smith, an insurance salesman, said he did not know what to do with the information. The allegations were just allegations, he said, not proven in a court of law.\u201cIf he did the crime, obviously it\u2019s disgusting and that breaks my heart for anyone that suffered,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other thing is, it\u2019s a little suspicious at this point because it\u2019s taken so long for things to come out.\u201dMr. Smith, a Republican, had decided earlier that Mr. Moore was \u201cnot intellectually sound enough\u201d to be a senator. But he was also strongly anti-abortion, and could not fathom voting for a Democrat. He said he might sit the Dec. 12 election out.Whatever happens in the election, stories long murmured around Gadsden are now out and have to be reckoned with. For some here, the controversy that comes along with that may not have been worth it.\u201cAmerican people have become a bucket of crabs,\u201d said John Leach, 51, who was reclining at his desk behind a warren of jewelry cases in a shop in downtown Gadsden. \u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to grab each other, destroy each other.\u201d\u201cDo I think he did it? I think something went on,\u201d Mr. Leach continued. Still, he said, his accusers should have come forward years ago. Or, maybe they should have kept to themselves. Just because long-buried bad things are true does not mean they should be unburied.\u201cI\u2019m a black guy, 51 years old,\u201d Mr. Leach said. \u201cWhat would it be like if I started digging up racism? It would be a mess, it would keep it going on and on. Let\u2019s just leave the bones in the cemetery.\u201dAlan Blinder and Campbell Robertson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Sentences Taiwanese Human Rights Activist in Subversion Case", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 A Chinese court sentenced a human rights activist from Taiwan to five years in prison Tuesday for state subversion, the first time China has convicted a Taiwanese citizen of that crime.China seeks to annex Taiwan, by force if necessary, though polls in Taiwan show scant desire to unify.Of special concern is Facebook. The Yueyang court alleged in September that Mr. Lee and his co-defendant, Peng Yuhua, a Chinese citizen, had used the social networking site to plan protests in China. Taiwan has one of the world\u2019s highest Facebook penetration rates, while China\u2019s government has blocked the site.Yibee Huang, the chief executive of Covenants Watch, an alliance of human rights organizations in Taiwan, described a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on Facebook use by friends and associates since Mr. Lee\u2019s trial. Mr. Lee had previously volunteered at Covenants Watch.Facebook has long been a popular forum for lively political debate among young Taiwanese, many of whom work or expect to one day work in China. Now, however, many young Taiwanese suspect that China is watching what they post, Ms. Huang said.\u201cThey will now strongly self-censor; there are topics that even while in Taiwan they won\u2019t discuss,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this is extremely harmful to Taiwan\u2019s democracy.\u201dMr. Lee\u2019s friends and family assert that his September confession was forced, a dominant view in the Taiwanese media and online forums. They also say they had never heard of Mr. Peng, who they believe is a prop used to create the appearance of Mr. Lee\u2019s conspiring with a Chinese citizen to sow discord in the authoritarian state.An academic manager at a Taipei community college, Mr. Lee had previously made trips to China without incident. He also regularly chatted online with Chinese acquaintances interested in Taiwan\u2019s transition from a one-party state under martial law 30 years ago to a democracy today, according to Cheng Shiow-jiuan, the director of the Taipei Wenshan Community College, where he last worked.Mr. Lee also donated money and books to the relatives of rights lawyers imprisoned in the crackdown on civil society by President Xi Jinping of China, the activist\u2019s wife, Lee Ching-yu, said in a March interview.Ms. Lee attended Tuesday\u2019s sentencing of her husband. In a statement released afterward, she said that \u201cpursuing ideals comes at a cost\u201d and that her husband had been fully aware that by promoting human rights in China he ran the risk of being subjected to forced confession and imprisonment.\u201dAs Lee Ming-cheh\u2019s wife, I\u2019ll say it one more time: I\u2019m extremely proud of everything he\u2019s done,\u201d she added.Outspoken and defiant, Ms. Lee has become a major figure in the Chinese human rights arena during the eight-month drama. After going public with her rejection of a secret offer by the Taiwan government to work with China via a go-between, she announced in April that she would fly to Beijing to rescue Mr. Lee herself. China canceled the document required by Taiwan citizens to enter the country, effectively banning her entry.China did, however, allow Ms. Lee to attend her husband\u2019s trial in Yueyang in September. Before leaving for China, she asked the Taiwanese people to forgive him should he say anything negative about Taiwan, since his statements were being made under duress.During his trial, Mr. Lee said that he had been misled by the Taiwanese news media, and had learned the true situation in China by watching state television during his months in detention.Taiwan\u2019s presidential office assailed Tuesday\u2019s ruling.\u201cLee Ming-cheh was a democracy activist who wanted to share the values of democracy and freedom in China,\u201d the office said in a statement. \u201cWe call on the Beijng authorities to release Mr. Lee as soon as possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Last-Minute Buys for Thanksgiving Wines", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThanksgiving is just about here. Preparations are well underway, everything seems to be in order, except \u2026 we forgot about the wine.This is not a drill.\u201cI\u2019m bringing the wine? I thought you were bringing the wine!\u201dAs crises go, this is a minor one, easily remedied. Many wine shops are open Thanksgiving morning (perhaps the owners understand how the holiday mind works). And if your particular merchant is taking the day off, supermarkets can do in a pinch, if state liquor laws allow it.The last minute is not the time to agonize over finding specific recommendations, esoteric selections or finely calibrated food-and-wine combinations. It is the moment to make the best of it, while minimizing the distress. Here are some quick possible solutions.I usually gravitate to smaller producers like Jean-Paul Brun, Marcel Lapierre, Julien Sunier, Michel T\u00eate and Dutraive, but on deadline you may not have the luxury to seek them out. Among the bigger brands you are likely to find, I would suggest Louis Jadot and Joseph Drouhin. Whichever you choose, they will cost around $15 to $30 a bottle.As with Beaujolais, the M\u00e2connais offers a simple hierarchy, from the modest M\u00e2con to the slightly more elevated M\u00e2con-Villages, which might also have the name of a specific village appended, like M\u00e2con-Lugny, or a combination of villages, like Vir\u00e9-Cless\u00e9, to the top appellations, like St.-V\u00e9ran or Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9.Some top names among small producers include La Soufrandi\u00e8re (and its n\u00e9gociant arm, Bret Brothers), Domaine Cheveau, Les H\u00e9ritiers du Comte Lafon and Julien Guillot.From California, consider Lioco and Sandhi for very good chardonnays and pinot noirs, most under $25. Lioco also makes an excellent California carignan, which would be delicious at Thanksgiving. So does Vesper Vineyards in the San Diego area.Other California labels to look for that provide great value in a range of wines \u2014 from cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay to zinfandel, sauvignon blanc and beyond \u2014 include Foxglove, Banshee, Broadside, Giornata, Camp and Route Stock.In that case, keep it simple. Pilsners and lagers, which tend to be snappier and lower in alcohol, are best earlier in the festivities, with snacks and the business of possibly reacquainting yourself with extended family and friends.For the main event, bring out the darker beers: the brown ales, porters and dry stouts. They, too, will be moderate in alcohol, but their richer, more complex flavors will go well with the turkey and sides. Of course, if preferences dictate otherwise, guests should be free to stick with whatever they like best throughout the meal.These beers should be available from good craft brewers, so don\u2019t sweat tracking down specific brands.No matter how late you shop, finding something good to drink will not be an issue. Just remember to buy plenty of whatever it is you select, because nothing is worse than running out early.

All over the globe, displacement is spreading, migration is increasing and dozens of countries are grappling with changing ideas of national identity.The pace of government policy \u2014 the management of migration and its impacts \u2014 is simply not keeping up.But the total number of refugees admitted for resettlement last year reached only 189,300, according to government statistics, up from 107,100 in 2015. Australia accepted 27,600 refugees in 2016 compared with 46,700 for Canada and 96,900 for the United States, and even that was nowhere near satisfying the overall need.In that same period, hundreds of thousands of refugees, mostly from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, fled their homes, risking their lives in dangerous boat trips, illegal border crossings and long bus and train journeys, seeking asylum in Western Europe and Scandinavia.Together they grabbed the public\u2019s attention, at least for a moment.Then the moment passed.But it\u2019s worth revisiting.We\u2019ll be printing and framing these in our Sydney offices, and they\u2019re worth looking at closely as Australia and the world continue to struggle with those who did not ask to flee, but feel that they must.______A train between Budapest and Vienna, filled with asylum seekers.

{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Repeal: What Could Happen and How It Could Affect You", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s our guide for internet users looking for answers.The net neutrality rules were passed in 2015 during the Obama administration when Democrats controlled the F.C.C.The major broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast have argued that utility-style regulation represents unnecessary government meddling that will reduce their incentives to invest and improve service. The result, they say, will be worse service for everyone in the long run.The biggest concern is that the internet will become pay-to-play technology with two tiers: one that has speedy service and one that doesn\u2019t. The high-speed lane would be occupied by big internet and media companies, and affluent households. For everyone else there would be the slow lane.The brand-name internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, analysts say, will comfortably be able to pay the higher rent. It will not affect their business, though it may crimp their profits. Avoiding higher prices is one reason the major internet companies have been champions of net neutrality.That will no longer be true, Mr. Bell wrote, without net neutrality rules that \u201censure that anyone who puts something on the internet has a fair shot at finding a life-changing audience.\u201dThe government-backed guarantee of equal access is why public interest groups, nongovernmental organizations, charities and millions of private citizens wrote to the F.C.C. in support of the net neutrality rules.But the broadband and telecom companies \u2014 and some economists \u2014 say that the freedom to charge different prices for different products and services is vital to healthy markets. That kind of \u201cprice discrimination,\u201d they say, is the fuel of innovation and efficiency.In a public comment earlier this year to the F.C.C., AT&T called the Obama-era rules \u201can unprecedented regulatory overreach for which there is no economic or marketplace justification.\u201dThe F.C.C. rules mandated net neutrality principles under a utility-style telecommunications law, called Title 2, that dates to 1934. The carriers fear that it all but ensures price regulation.\u201cWhat they really object to is Title 2, not the net neutrality principles,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an independent analyst.Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who is credited with coining the phrase \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d said the repeal plan not only rolls back the Obama-era rules, it goes further. It specifically permits broadband carriers to block media content, Mr. Wu said, an added power which was not the case during the administration of George W. Bush.\u201cAn allowance of blocking is really pretty shocking.\u201d Mr. Wu said in an email.Yet if government is in retreat, then consumers are left to trust the behavior of the internet-access companies like Charter and AT&T. In their filings with the F.C.C., the companies have claimed that faith would be well founded. Market incentives, Charter told the F.C.C., push the companies to provide the best service to its customers, catering to consumer demand.Charter said it voluntarily adheres to net neutrality principles, and will continue to do so. \u201cWe do not block, throttle, or otherwise interfere with the online activity of our customers,\u201d the company said.But a weakness in the free-market argument, industry analysts say, is that in some regional and rural markets, households have only one internet provider available to them. That undermines the theory that competition will protect consumers.Roger L. Kay, an independent technology analyst, predicted that larger bills \u2014 not content blocking \u2014 would be the most likely result. If the big internet and media companies will have to pay their carriers more for high-speed services, the expenses will trickle down to households.Consumers, Mr. Kay said, \u201cwill end up paying higher prices for essentially the same service.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Evil Is Tech?", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot long ago, tech was the coolest industry. Everybody wanted to work at Google, Facebook and Apple. But over the past year the mood has shifted.Some now believe tech is like the tobacco industry \u2014 corporations that make billions of dollars peddling a destructive addiction. Some believe it is like the N.F.L. \u2014 something millions of people love, but which everybody knows leaves a trail of human wreckage in its wake.Surely the people in tech \u2014 who generally want to make the world a better place \u2014 don\u2019t want to go down this road. It will be interesting to see if they can take the actions necessary to prevent their companies from becoming social pariahs.There are three main critiques of big tech.The first is that it is destroying the young. Social media promises an end to loneliness but actually produces an increase in solitude and an intense awareness of social exclusion. Texting and other technologies give you more control over your social interactions but also lead to thinner interactions and less real engagement with the world.Eighth graders who spend 10 or more hours a week on social media are 56 percent more likely to say they are unhappy than those who spend less time. Eighth graders who are heavy users of social media increase their risk of depression by 27 percent. Teens who spend three or more hours a day on electronic devices are 35 percent more likely to have a risk factor for suicide, like making a plan for how to do it. Girls, especially hard hit, have experienced a 50 percent rise in depressive symptoms.Snapchat has Snapstreak, which rewards friends who snap each other every single day, thus encouraging addictive behavior. News feeds are structured as \u201cbottomless bowls\u201d so that one page view leads down to another and another and so on forever. Most social media sites create irregularly timed rewards; you have to check your device compulsively because you never know when a burst of social affirmation from a Facebook like may come.The third critique is that Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are near monopolies that use their market power to invade the private lives of their users and impose unfair conditions on content creators and smaller competitors. The political assault on this front is gaining steam. The left is attacking tech companies because they are mammoth corporations; the right is attacking them because they are culturally progressive. Tech will have few defenders on the national scene.Obviously, the smart play would be for the tech industry to get out in front and clean up its own pollution. There are activists like Tristan Harris of Time Well Spent, who is trying to move the tech world in the right directions. There are even some good engineering responses. I use an app called Moment to track and control my phone usage.The big breakthrough will come when tech executives clearly acknowledge the central truth: Their technologies are extremely useful for the tasks and pleasures that require shallower forms of consciousness, but they often crowd out and destroy the deeper forms of consciousness people need to thrive.Online is a place for human contact but not intimacy. Online is a place for information but not reflection. It gives you the first stereotypical thought about a person or a situation, but it\u2019s hard to carve out time and space for the third, 15th and 43rd thought.Online is a place for exploration but discourages cohesion. It grabs control of your attention and scatters it across a vast range of diverting things. But we are happiest when we have brought our lives to a point, when we have focused attention and will on one thing, wholeheartedly with all our might.Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote that we take a break from the distractions of the world not as a rest to give us more strength to dive back in, but as the climax of living. \u201cThe seventh day is a palace in time which we build. It is made of soul, joy and reticence,\u201d he said. By cutting off work and technology we enter a different state of consciousness, a different dimension of time and a different atmosphere, a \u201cmine where the spirit\u2019s precious metal can be found.\u201dImagine if instead of claiming to offer us the best things in life, tech merely saw itself as providing efficiency devices. Its innovations can save us time on lower-level tasks so we can get offline and there experience the best things in life.Imagine if tech pitched itself that way. That would be an amazing show of realism and, especially, humility, which these days is the ultimate and most disruptive technology.Advertisement"}

A Hispanic woman won the mayor\u2019s race in Topeka, Kan. A Sikh man was elected mayor in Hoboken, N.J. Latina, Vietnamese and transgender female candidates won state legislative races. Black candidates were elected lieutenant governor in New Jersey and Virginia. A Liberian refugee in Helena, Mont., was elected mayor.Mark Keam, a Korean-American Democrat who was re-elected on Tuesday to his seat in Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates, said the wave of first-time minority candidates was a direct response to feeling snipped out of the American picture by Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and divisive language.\u201cIn Trump\u2019s America, people are getting screwed and those getting screwed more than others are people who\u2019ve never had a voice in the government,\u201d Mr. Keam said. \u201cThose are motivations a white guy wouldn\u2019t have.\u201dSome are skeptical of reading too much into one off-year election. And even Democrats have had heated disagreements over whether identity politics help the party or drive people away. But David Ramadan, a Republican who served in the Virginia General Assembly from 2012 to 2016 said the warning for his party was clear.\u201cTuesday\u2019s results show that unless the Republicans go back to being mainstream conservatives and run on issues like education, jobs and transportations instead of sanctuary cities and Confederate statues, they will hand not only Virginia to liberals, but they will hand the country to liberals and Congress to liberals next year,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Ramadan said.Ms. Roem, 33, a former reporter for a newspaper in the Washington suburbs, tried to focus on issues like traffic, while fending off attacks from Republicans, including the state party, that she was morally degenerate and not really a woman.\u201cHelp me protect conservative values in Virginia!\u201d her opponent, Bob Marshall, a 26-year incumbent known for his social conservatism, wrote in a campaign flier.Ms. Roem, who came out in 2013, a year after beginning her transition to a woman, campaigned in a rainbow head scarf and will be the first openly transgender person in the country seated in a state legislature.She was born and still lives in Manassas, and is something of a policy nerd. She also sings in a heavy metal band, Cab Ride Home, which she said would be taking a hiatus while she focuses as a lawmaker on raising teacher pay, Medicaid expansion \u2014 and, a top issue in her suburban district, traffic congestion.A former federal prosecutor and graduate of Duke University and Columbia Law School, Mr. Fairfax had never held elective office. His campaign had an upbeat feel, marked by television ads that showed him preparing peanut butter sandwiches for his young children before he drove them to school.Mr. Fairfax will instantly be seen as a top contender for governor in Virginia in 2021. Mr. Northam is limited to one, four-year term. (Virginia governors can serve multiple terms, but not two consecutively.)Jenny Durkan, who will be Seattle\u2019s first openly lesbian mayor and its first female mayor since the 1920s is a former United States attorney and a former member of the Teamsters union.When he started reading the nasty Facebook posts and hearing the hostile comments from politicians a few years back, Wilmot Collins decided he had to do something. They were accusing refugees, like him, of being terrorists, milking the welfare system and committing crimes.\u201cWhen I started listening to the rhetoric, I said, \u2018This is crazy,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Collins, who settled in Helena, Mont., as a refugee from Liberia in 1994. \u201cHere in Montana, we\u2019re fighting the notion that refugees are terrorists. Part of me wants to show them that, \u2018No, here\u2019s the face of a refugee. These are who refugees are. Here is my family. This is what refugees look like. We are not terrorists.\u2019 \u201dMr. Collins, 54, said he saw his election as a repudiation of some of the restrictive immigration rhetoric of President Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s telling the bigger America that this is not about race, this is not about national origin,\u201d Mr. Collins said. He added: \u201cWhat Helena said yesterday was, \u2018We\u2019re looking for a good candidate and we believe in this person.\u2019 \u201dMr. Collins (whose cousin, Helene Cooper, is a reporter for The New York Times) said that some of his major platform planks included providing funding for essential services like the fire and police departments, and creating more affordable housing in part because of the large populations of homeless veterans and teenagers in Helena.Mr. Collins, who is married with two adult children, came to the United States after fleeing the civil war in Liberia. He works for the state as a child protection investigator and has been a member of the Navy Reserve for two decades.Born in New York and raised in Puerto Rico, she became homeless at 17 and pregnant at 19. A pastor at the church where she sang in the choir told her she was smart and should go to college on the mainland. That led Ms. De La Isla, now 41, to Wichita State University.Today she is a single mother of three, a son and two daughters, after escaping an abusive marriage with the help of a program at the Y.W.C.A. in Topeka, she said on Tuesday after narrowly winning the mayor\u2019s race.\u201cAll these experiences I\u2019ve turned into blessings,\u201d Ms. De La Isla said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to serve people when you\u2019re not judging them from the get-go.\u201dMs. De La Isla first became involved in Topeka, a city of about 122,000 with small pockets of Hispanics and African-Americans, by counseling people about their financial credit.That led to running Topeka Habitat for Humanity, which led to her attending City Council meetings on revitalizing the downtown. A councilman who was elected mayor suggested that she seek his seat, which she won four years ago.\u201cI\u2019ll never forget having a conversation with my girls: My youngest said if you get elected you\u2019re showing me I can do anything,\u201d Ms. De La Isla said. \u201cThe pressure was on. It\u2019s been a journey.\u201dHala Ayala, one of two women who will be the first Latinas in the Virginia General Assembly, plunged into politics after helping to organize a contingent from Prince William County to attend the Washington Women\u2019s March in January.\u201cAfter the Women\u2019s March it was like, no more,\u201d she said. \u201cRun for office. Make change.\u201dMs. Ayala, 44, quit a job in cybersecurity for the Coast Guard to run for office. The state party emphasized that she had a security clearance to rebuff Republican TV ads and mailers raising fears of illegal immigrants and crime.In fact, she said the attacks produced a backlash in her Northern Virginia district, which has a large military and immigrant population. Lines at polls on Tuesday were the most racially and ethnically diverse she said she had seen in a decade of volunteering.A single mother of two adult children, aged 20 and 22, Ms. Ayala has lived in the county over 35 years.

{"Headline": "My Vagina Is Terrific. Your Opinion About It Is Not.", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "The CycleI dared to discuss my anatomy. Men couldn\u2019t handle it.Supported byThere is a rash of men explaining vaginas to me.That is what I have decided to name a collective of mansplainers. A murder of crows, a parliament of owls, a rash of mansplainers. In medicine a rash can be a mild annoyance that goes away and never returns. A rash can also portend a serious medical condition, even something malignant.There have always been a few men here and there explaining vaginas to me. I have suffered fools eager to use pickup lines about being an amateur gynecologist, detailing their imagined superior knowledge of female anatomy and physiology. Men who think sitting beside them at a bar and smiling \u2014 because if you don\u2019t smile, you get told to smile \u2014 is an invitation to tell you how they will make you scream and moan.I know that many other women have had their vaginas explained to them, because for the past 25 years my career has been dedicated to treating vaginal and vulvar problems. I have listened to women with completely normal exams weep that they have been told that they do not smell or taste correctly. That they are too wet, or too loose, or too gross.These women all shared something: They were told these things by men. While I admit this is anecdotal data, my years of listening to secret shame about healthy vaginas and vulvas seems to suggest it is largely, if not entirely, male partners who exploit vaginal and vulvar insecurities as a weapon of emotional abuse and control.But it was the Vicks VapoRub that put me over the edge.But while I may not have complete confidence in my appearance, I have professional confidence in spades. There are few people, if any, who know more about the lower genital tract than I do. So when this man began to tell me how my healthy vagina could be better, I dumped him.It didn\u2019t seem weird or overly personal to write this one paragraph about my experience. I talk about vaginas all day long. It is the inability to talk about vaginas without shame that is at the very core of genital-tract profiteering. If a gynecologist who specializes in vulvar and vaginal health can\u2019t talk about it, then who can? I have revealed details of my son\u2019s death, and that feels far more intimate and emotionally daring to me.And then the men came. They came to share their opinions regarding my vagina, writing on my blog and at me on Twitter. They flocked to my Instagram and my Facebook. One group of gentlemen, in at least their 40s, even decided that this story of me being dumped supposedly because of my vagina was worthy of a laugh on their podcast.This rash bombarded me in both public and private comments. Men wondered if I had washed \u201cthat thang yet?\u201d One man wrote that I \u201cmust be INTO smelly ones! How nice for you \u2014 we prefer FRESH as a daisy ones!\u201d Another man warned me that \u201cWe men had a meeting, all 3.5 billion of us.\u201d At the meeting they had apparently decided to \u201cdouble down on calling out\u201d my smelly vagina.More men sought me out to explain vaginas to me. They gave me false information on how to clean and prep them (for men, of course), and told me how gross my vagina must be, and hurled insults that I cannot print here.The state of my healthy vagina brought more scorn from men than anything I have ever written about \u2014 and I write about second-trimester abortions, so that is saying something.To the women who have been told they were too wet, too dry, too messy, too smelly, too gross, too saggy or too bloody, I have heard you. I know you stand in drugstores wondering why there are all these hygiene products if they are unnecessary. I know you stare into the internet and wonder, if celebrities say they steam their vaginas, or have 10-step vaginal prep regimens, then maybe vaginal neglect really is a flaw that ruins relationships.All I can say is, if you have a medical concern, see a doctor. And: If someone speaks to you about your body with anything but kindness and concern, it is he who has a problem. And: The vagina is like a self-cleaning oven.To the rash of mansplainers and The New York Post, thank you. This experience proves that shaming women about physiologically normal and functioning vaginas is epidemic. The cure for this rash is information. You can either listen and learn or you can take a seat in the back of class and shut up. The era in which men can shame women for their perfectly healthy vaginas is now coming to an end.Dr. Jen Gunter is an obstetrician and gynecologist practicing in California.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Minnesota, Outrage and Sorrow Over Al Franken Allegations", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. PAUL \u2014 Vile behavior, said one liberal activist. Absolutely wrong, said a lawyer who votes Democratic. More proof that he does not live up to Minnesota values, said a Republican woman who voted against him.As Minnesotans absorbed the news that their own Senator Al Franken, a Democrat, had become the latest public official to be accused of mistreating women, there was widespread condemnation of his behavior in his home state. On Thursday, Mr. Franken apologized for an incident in 2006 in which he was accused of groping and forcibly kissing Leeann Tweeden, a radio newscaster, during a U.S.O. tour in the Middle East before he was elected to the Senate.But many voters in Minnesota were not ready to demand Mr. Franken\u2019s resignation, even after aiming the same call at two state legislators accused of sexual harassment earlier this month. Some said they were trying to make sense of the details of the allegations in the context of Mr. Franken\u2019s record as a liberal leader who had been held up as an advocate for women\u2019s rights.Other questions lingered too: Would there be more claims? And where did the allegation against Mr. Franken fit into the flood of sexual harassment and assault allegations launched against an array of leaders in Hollywood, politics and business?In cafes and on Facebook pages, people here expressed outrage, and sometimes sorrow, that someone they saw as a progressive and a defender of women had behaved so offensively. They praised his record on women\u2019s rights, especially for Native American women, a major issue in Minnesota. They reasoned that the incident was a long time ago, when Mr. Franken was a comedian and not an elected official.\u201cIf this is a one-off, I\u2019m willing to give him some slack,\u201d said Barbara Kueppers, 72, a retired lawyer from Minneapolis. She also said she supported a Senate ethics hearing into Mr. Franken\u2019s behavior.\u201cAre other things going to come out?\u201d she continued. \u201cMany of us, both professional and nonprofessional women, have been subjected to unwanted touching, kissing and other boorish behavior by our male colleagues. It\u2019s time to end it.\u201dOthers said they had seen this brand of behavior from Mr. Franken before. During his Senate campaign in 2008, Republicans pointed to a column he wrote for Playboy in 2000 called \u201cPorn-O-Rama!\u201d that joked about visiting a sex laboratory; a sketch he proposed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in which the CBS journalist Lesley Stahl was drugged and raped; and comments at a Human Rights Campaign dinner, before he was in the Senate, that included jokes about lesbians.\u201cI think Senator Franken has a track record and a history of inappropriate comments and actions,\u201d Jennifer Carnahan, chairwoman of the Minnesota Republican Party, said in an interview. \u201cI think that anyone that is willing to make jokes to that level, put females in positions where they feel uncomfortable and harassed, I don\u2019t see how you can be an advocate for women.\u201dPrivately, some Democratic officials in Minnesota said they felt uneasy not calling for his resignation, worried that it would expose them to accusations of hypocrisy. This week, some national Democrats have publicly questioned the response at the time to Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual relationship with an intern while he was president, with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York now saying that Mr. Clinton should have resigned.But they also tried to draw a distinction between Mr. Franken\u2019s behavior \u2014 which they saw as isolated \u2014 and the pervasive, longstanding patterns of sexual harassment that other elected officials were accused of.One of Mr. Franken\u2019s close allies, Senator Amy Klobuchar, also a Minnesota Democrat, said that she \u201cstrongly\u201d condemned his behavior and that the Senate Ethics Committee should investigate it, but she has not called for him to step down. The editorial board of The Star Tribune in Minneapolis, which only days ago called for the resignations of the state legislators accused of sexual harassment, including unwanted advances and unsolicited text messages with sexual content, wrote: \u201cFranken, so far, is accused of one incident that occurred before he took office. That does not excuse or mitigate the gravity of his conduct, which was despicable, but the story was still developing as this editorial was being written.\u201dOn Friday, several women who had worked on Mr. Franken\u2019s staff released a statement in his defense. \u201cMany of us spent years working for Senator Franken in Minnesota and Washington,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn our time working for the senator, he treated us with the utmost respect. He valued our work and our opinions and was a champion for women both in the legislation he supported and in promoting women to leadership roles in our offices.\u201dA native of Minnesota, Mr. Franken ran for the Senate in 2008 after a career as an entertainer, liberal radio host and author of books with titles like \u201cLies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right.\u201d He is eligible to run for a third term in 2020.Minnesota is led by one of the most liberal governors in the country, Mark Dayton, who has repeatedly clashed with the Republican-controlled State Legislature. Hillary Clinton won the state by a razor-thin margin in 2016.Mr. Dayton, who would appoint a replacement if Mr. Franken were to resign, said in a statement that he was \u201cshocked to hear these reports\u201d on Thursday.For his part, Mr. Franken apologized to Ms. Tweeden and said he would \u201cgladly\u201d cooperate with an ethics investigation.\u201cI respect women,\u201d he said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t respect men who don\u2019t. And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.\u201dMatt Furber reported from St. Paul and Julie Bosman from Chicago.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Euthanasia Law Passes in Australia for First Time", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a two and a half years of debate and amendments, Victoria\u2019s Lower House ratified the euthanasia bill, handing a victory to the state government of Premier Daniel Andrews, who had lobbied heavily for the law.Starting in mid-2019, the law will allow Victorians with a terminal, incurable illness \u2014 and, in most cases, a life expectancy of less than six months \u2014 to obtain a lethal drug within 10 days of requesting it.The state joins the Netherlands, Canada, Belgium, Colombia and Luxembourg in legalizing euthanasia. Several other countries \u2014 and states and jurisdictions in the United States, including California, Washington, D.C., and Oregon \u2014 have passed laws allowing assisted suicide, in which doctors, in certain cases, may prescribe or suggest a means in which patients may end their own lives, without directly assisting in the act.Globally, assisted dying advocates have long argued for it on grounds of compassion and averting prolonged physical suffering for the terminally ill.Another Australian jurisdiction, the Northern Territory, had a short-lived assisted dying act, but it was struck down by the federal government in 1997.Victoria\u2019s amendments to the law make it more restrictive than those passed elsewhere. For instance, it allows a drug to be administered on behalf of a patient only if the patient is unable to administer it. Additionally, a patient needs to have been a resident of Victoria for at least one year to be eligible.The bill faced substantial opposition, including from Mr. Andrews\u2019s own deputy, James Merlino, who last month sought and failed to block the passage of the bill.\u201cMy concern is proponents of this legislation will come back some time in the future and seek to expand it,\u201d he said in a news conference at the time.Broad concerns about the law, and the ways it may be interpreted, manipulated or expanded, led the state\u2019s government to incorporate a slew of concessions and amendments, often in consultation with the Australian Medical Association, which advised in the process while opposing the law\u2019s passage.Dr. Lorraine Baker, the president of the association\u2019s Victoria branch, acknowledged her organization\u2019s difficulty in navigating the legislation.\u201cHistorically, for the medical profession, everything is about preserving life,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is such a fundamental ethical principle over centuries. However, we\u2019re living in a society where now, in first world countries, life can be prolonged. Therefore, by default, apparent suffering can be prolonged.\u201dDr. Baker said that a survey of Australian Medical Association members last year showed a strong minority of support for euthanasia policies.\u201cHowever, the majority of the profession, unsurprisingly, was opposed,\u201d she said.Dr. Baker said the association refrained from stronger criticism of the bill because certain elements were added, such as strong vetting and consultation with those considering ending their lives. Doctors, for instance, cannot first suggest assisted dying to a patient.She did, however, warn of unforeseen consequences that could result from the law.\u201cThe experience of watching people die, from whatever cause, is painful for anyone who watches it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether or not it\u2019s a well-managed dying, it\u2019s a challenge for the people around them.\u201dAnd while opponents of the bill often argued that decisions about euthanasia should be left in the hands of the medical profession, Dr. Baker disagreed.\u201cUltimately,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s a matter for society and the government.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He said the interaction was consensual, and there had been no complaints of harassment by Mr. Goodman while he was a representative.\u201cWe all bring our own struggles and our own trials into public life,\u201d Mr. Goodman said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThat has been true for me, and I sincerely regret that my actions and choices have kept me from serving my constituents and our state in a way that reflects the best ideals of public service.

They became friends and would exchange text messages. Mr. Hadlock said some of the texts were \u201csexual\u201d and \u201csalacious\u201d and that they once had phone sex.Mr. Hadlock said they continued to exchange Facebook messages until 2014.Another man, Chris Donnelly, 32, said in a phone interview on Saturday that Mr. Goodman responded to an online ad seeking a sexual encounter that he posted in 2008.He said Mr. Goodman asked him to keep their meeting secret. But after Mr. Goodman won the Ohio Republican primary in 2016, Mr. Donnelly said he described the encounter to a Republican political operative who promised that officials would speak to Mr. Goodman. It was not clear to Mr. Donnelly what, if any, action had been taken.\u201cIt annoyed me that they didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with the hypocrisy of it,\u201d he said.Mr. Goodman, who did not respond to phone calls seeking comment on Saturday and Sunday, is one of several politicians facing accusations of sexual misconduct, harassment or abuse. That list includes Senator Al Franken, a Democrat of Minnesota, who was accused of groping and forcibly kissing a woman in 2006; and the former Alabama state judge Roy Moore, a Republican who is running for a Senate seat and faces allegations of having pursued and harassed several underage girls.Mr. Zawistowski said that while Mr. Goodman was right to resign given the allegation about an unwanted sexual advance, the rush of accusations in recent weeks felt like a \u201cSpanish Inquisition.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all so polarizing, and I think both sides are guilty of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re throwing these bombs \u2014 who\u2019s the most immoral?

It\u2019s hard to tell if the faint woody undertone of the flower is a scent or a flavor, but it refreshes, with a controlled sweetness.His potent dishes, uncompromising in sourness and heat, make it a worthy destination alongside its neighbors \u2014 including, across the street, the simian-themed Thai bar Pata Paplean, known for tom yum cocktails; the pink-walled Tea Cup Cafe, which slings pork intestine soup alongside red velvet cake and macarons; and, down the block, Ayada, one of the city\u2019s best Thai restaurants.But Mr. Kosalanan, who grew up in Chanthaburi in eastern Thailand, wanted to focus on desserts. He could offer only a few at Khao Kang; now, at Khao Nom, which he opened in October behind Khao Kang \u2014 in a storefront that once housed a church, then a foot therapist\u2019s office \u2014 he has room for a more expansive lineup that changes almost daily.The pastry case might be stocked with pie-like wedges of taro mashed and whipped like potatoes and transformed into a confoundingly light custard. Tiny pastel rice-flour cakes suggest coins in a fairy kingdom, dimpled at the center and haunted by jasmine. Steamed puddings of coconut cream, with no meddling but salt, rest atop delicate translucent bases of rice flour, palm sugar, coconut milk and pandan \u2014 a flavor so difficult to pin down, I can offer little more than to say that it always makes me picture bamboo slicked with rain.A coconut custard reveals a buried treasure of corn and tapioca pearls. Shortbread, a borrowing from the West, is utterly estranged from its origins by a fragrance that infiltrates and possesses the dough: Mr. Kosalanan smokes the flour first, over a scented candle. Luk chup are a sly improvement on marzipan, made of mung-bean paste, with a subdued mustiness and notable restraint in sugar; pieces are sculpted into cherry tomatoes, miniature peaches and alarmingly realistic chile peppers, Corvette-red with a high gloss.These are desserts that favor surprise and evanescence over sweetness. Sometimes they\u2019re not even as sweet as the savory dishes that make up the brief menu. Sugar seems to have found its way into turmeric-stained crepes, fried into a crispy sleeve for ground chicken, shrimp and tofu interlaced with shredded coconut and pickled radish; a half-pancake, half-omelet with briny pops of mussels, slapped over a hash of bean sprouts; and bronzed nubbly corn fritters with whole kernels caught in a mesh of batter.Occasional streaks of heat, as in maeng pla, flaked mackerel strewn with roasted peanuts and tucked into lettuce, are a relief. But these are snacks, after all, not meant to be eaten en masse or to compose a meal. I would have been happy with just curry puffs, neatly pleated and radiating warmth, and rice noodle rolls, akin to Chinese cheung fun: floppy, chewy bands of rice-flour dough loosely wrapped around a nicely salty filling of chicken, tofu and shiitakes. The accompanying soy sauce pitches sweet against sour, dark and viscous, pulling at the spoon like honey.Or better yet: Start with a meal at Khao Kang, turn the corner and end with dessert here. Khao Nom is a lovely place to idle, under high ceilings with teardrop-shaped glass terrariums dangling from exposed pipes, at tables engineered from vintage sewing machines, with a cast-iron lacework of legs and foot pedals. There\u2019s a pay telephone by the front door, perfectly restored, perfectly unusable.Mr. Kosalanan flits back and forth between restaurants through a connected basement. His mother and his aunt hold the fort at Khao Kang, while his sisters-in-law take orders at Khao Nom. They are boundless in patience. There are so many sweets, all requiring names and translations, and they gently give you every one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Spreads Propaganda to U.S. on Facebook, a Platform It Bans at Home", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China does not allow its people to gain access to Facebook, a powerful tool for disseminating information and influencing opinion.As if to demonstrate the platform\u2019s effectiveness, outside its borders China uses it to spread state-produced propaganda around the world, including the United States. So much do China\u2019s government and companies value Facebook that the country is Facebook\u2019s biggest advertising market in Asia, even as it is the only major country in the region that blocks the social network.Each quarter, China\u2019s government, through its state media agencies, spends hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy Facebook ads, according to a person with knowledge of those deals, who was unauthorized to talk publicly about the company\u2019s revenue streams.China\u2019s propaganda efforts are in the spotlight with President Trump visiting the country and American lawmakers investigating foreign powers\u2019 use of technology to sway voters in the United States.Last week, executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter were grilled in Washington about Russia\u2019s use of American social media platforms to influence the 2016 presidential election.During Facebook\u2019s time in the congressional hot seat last week, Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, asked whether China had also run ads to affect the United States election. Facebook\u2019s general counsel replied that to his knowledge it had not.There is no indication that China meddled in the American election, but the Communist government\u2019s use of Facebook is ironic given its apparent fear of the platform. It also hasn\u2019t been reluctant to use it as a soapbox where China\u2019s relationship with the United States is concerned.While China\u2019s propaganda channels on Facebook are not nearly as subtle as Russian groups when it comes to influencing opinion, their techniques are nonetheless instructive.A similar blend of stories \u2014 pandas and idyllic Chinese landscapes next to heavy coverage of the mass shooting in Texas \u2014 has proliferated across China\u2019s official Facebook channels in the lead-up to Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Beijing, which began on Wednesday.While much of it is unlikely to sway the average American\u2019s mind, such posts reach people across the world, many of whom are newer to the internet and may have a less sophisticated understanding of media. China\u2019s state media has Facebook channels dedicated to Africa and other regions of the world, and it seems evident that it is offering itself as an alternative to the Western media for a more global audience.A video posted by Xinhua, which already has about 100,000 views, presents a series of man-on-the-street interviews with Chinese people talking about the United States. It begins on a positive note, with questions about Mr. Trump and what they like about the United States.About halfway through the video, however, the tone changes and people are asked to describe the problems they see with the United States.At that point, the interviewees get critical. \u201cU.S.A. interferes with others\u2019 lives arrogantly,\u201d one woman says. \u201cEvery person and nation has its own culture and customs, no need to interfere.\u201dAnother woman addresses America directly: \u201cDon\u2019t be so self-important and arrogant.\u201dEven children are asked about the relationship between the United States and China. \u201cSometimes they went too far in bullying others,\u201d one says of the Americans. \u201cThey don\u2019t respect China and use South Korea to spy on China,\u201d says another. \u201cThey also sent weapons to South Korea.\u201dWhen asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump, one man says: \u201cLet him learn from China.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Reality TV Teaches Us About Russia\u2019s Influence Campaign", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIn May 2016, a Facebook page called Heart of Texas urged its nearly 254,000 followers to rise up against what it considered to be an urgent cultural menace. A mosque in Houston had opened up a new library, and Heart of Texas planned to protest. \u201cStop Islamization of Texas,\u201d it warned.As I watched these videos recently, I had an epiphany about the Russia influence campaign. The Houston protest videos depicted a bunch of Americans duped into fighting each other in public, all at the whim of an unseen force that, through expert and surreptitious cajoling, had gotten them to lose control of themselves on camera. I\u2019d seen this show many times before, and you probably have, too. It\u2019s called \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201dOver the past few days, I reached out to several reality show producers, asking them to compare the Russian digital influence campaign and the world of unscripted TV. The more they told me about reality shows, the more the metaphor seemed to explain Russia\u2019s trolling campaign \u2014 how it worked, what it aimed to do and why campaigns like it will be so difficult to fight.One of the more surprising findings about the Russian influence campaign is its political incoherence. The documents released so far suggest that, as in the Houston protest, the trolls didn\u2019t seem to care very much about pushing one political side over another. They were happy to push all sides \u2014 to get people to argue for and against the Islamic library \u2014 which suggests their ultimate goal was to sow drama.Why? Reality TV offers a guide: Because drama is easy to produce, and because drama sells.On a show where the action stems from the interplay of people living in close quarters \u2014 like \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d \u2014 there are often producers on set who subtly, and sometimes less than subtly, prod the contestants into acting in certain ways. How often this happens, and to what degree, varies greatly from show to show and is matter of great secrecy and controversy within the industry.But pretty much everyone in the world of reality TV acknowledges that it happens to some degree on most shows, and that there are certain basic ways to manufacture drama. Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, a former producer on \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d who later created \u201cUnreal,\u201d a scripted show about the reality industry, said the key to manipulating contestants into acting a certain way was to \u201ctap into their fears, passions and ego.\u201d\u201cFacebook pages are veritable instruction manuals for someone who wants to exploit you,\u201d Ms. Shapiro said. Given these tools, the Russian plan was simple: \u201cYou just poke the bears, put them in a cage and let them fight.\u201dBut it doesn\u2019t end there. In the same way that cage-fighting bears sells on reality TV, such conflict also sells on Facebook\u2019s News Feed, which rewards posts that get a lot of engagement, as well as on Twitter and the larger ecosystem of amped-up cable news that feeds off viral content.The Russian trolls clearly understood this. They based their campaigns on well-known divisions \u2014 racial, political, religious \u2014 and the conflicts they generated spread far across social media, and were then widely covered by the news media.\u201cIf Simon Cowell once tapped into a main artery of negativity in American life, Facebook and Twitter and 24-hour news really picked that up,\u201d said Mike Duffy, a co-founder of Ugly Brother Studios, which produces many unscripted shows, referring to the acerbic judge of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re pushing the same types of bombastic characters, and they\u2019re seeing a ratings increase.\u201d\u201cThe contestants have zero ability to contribute narratives about themselves,\u201d she said.There\u2019s another camp that suggests that while the circumstances on most shows are contrived, the contestants\u2019 emotional responses are deeply real.\u201cThe way we generate drama on reality TV is to put someone in the most extreme environment possible and then watch for their genuine reaction,\u201d said Troy DeVolld, a longtime producer and the author of \u201cReality TV: An Insider\u2019s Guide to TV\u2019s Hottest Market.\u201d In fact, he said, reality TV would be boring if that weren\u2019t the case \u2014 the whole reason we watch is \u201cwe can tell how seriously everyone is taking what\u2019s going on, even in the most absurd of circumstances.\u201dI\u2019m not here to adjudicate this debate. But I will point out that it matches the question at the heart of the Russian-influence saga: Did Russia\u2019s trolls persuade Americans to act in ways that they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise \u2014 or were they merely providing us a framework for expressing our deeply held political and social ideas?The answer is not obvious. On the one hand, it\u2019s clear that there are cases \u2014 like the Houston protest \u2014 where the Russian campaign prompted real people to take real action in the real world.What\u2019s less clear is whether we should discount those protesters\u2019 actions and emotions simply because they were influenced by a Russian Facebook campaign. After all, both sides were genuinely angry about the mosque; whoever inspired the campaign, their feelings weren\u2019t fake news.This gets to what\u2019s really pernicious about the Russian campaign. It so deftly blended artifice and reality \u2014 for so many people, across so many issues, in so many places \u2014 that it is impossible, now, for any of us to tell where reality and fakery begin and end.Is it the trolls\u2019 world, or is it ours?Advertisement"}

Shares in the magazine publisher jumped 9 percent to $18.42 this morning on news of the transaction.In an apparent effort to win over his potential new colleagues, Mr. Mulvaney even brought a present.The conflict will ultimately come down to which statute applies to replacing now-departed director Richard Cordray: the Dodd-Frank law that created the C.F.P.B., or the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.Noah Feldman, a professor of constitutional and international law at Harvard University, argues at Bloomberg View that Ms. Engish\u2019s \u201csuit is a partisan maneuver that will detract from the seriousness of the effort to keep executive power in check where it matters.\u201d\u201cAs a general matter, the Constitution expects the president to be able to appoint the heads of agencies in the executive branch...The idea that Trump wouldn\u2019t be able to name his own acting director of the CFPB therefore contradicts basic principles of democratic legitimacy. It\u2019s at best a bug in a complex statutory scheme, not a feature.

{"Headline": "Readers React: \u2018Al Franken, Noooooo!\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReactions from thousands of readers on The Times\u2019s digital platforms covered a range of views. Mr. Franken\u2019s supporters shared their personal disappointment. Others said he should resign. As word came out that the woman had accepted the senator\u2019s apology, some readers parsed the severity of the allegation against him compared with complaints against other prominent men. Several readers questioned the motives of the accuser, Leeann Tweeden, who is a conservative radio host and an occasional guest on the Fox News Channel.Responses have been edited for clarity and length.\u201cSenator Franken, I\u2019m disheartened and saddened by these allegations and whatever you did that you call comedy. I\u2019ve been a \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 fan since the beginning and let slide most of the crude sketches. But this is real life. I thought you had a chance at becoming president in 2020. What will you do to fix this mess?\u201d\u201cPhenomenally disappointed to hear about Franken\u2019s reprehensible, disgusting behavior. And yet I find I am not surprised to hear that another member of a group made up predominantly of older white men who are wealthy, powerful and protected by legions of assistants, attorneys and the power of their positions is a petri dish of sexism, misogyny and sexual harassment.\u201cIt\u2019s not a swamp, it\u2019s a man-made cesspool.\u201d\u201cAl Franken, noooooo! I want to believe his explanation of the events, that it was a misunderstanding followed by a joke in poor taste. But history has shown lately that men with even a few accusations like this often have closets deeply packed with skeletons.\u201d\u201cI like(d) Al Franken. Until I heard about this. If it\u2019s true, he should resign.\u201d\u201cI am dismayed at what is now being termed \u2018assault\u2019 and how easily we use the word \u2018violated.\u2019 I say that as a husband of a woman who was actually assaulted in a violent way last year. She ended up getting drugged, raped and impregnated by a stranger (and yes, we decided on an abortion). As a child, I was molested at 4 to 6 years old many times by entrusted family friends. When my wife and I say \u2018me too,\u2019 we are referring to truly terrible things that have happened to us by people who have, to our knowledge, escaped any justice for their actions.\u201cWe as a society need to have a conversation, great. But I no longer feel that we are having a conversation about sexual violence, but rather, about how crass many men are.\u201d\u201cWhat Franken did was grossly inappropriate. But groping her breasts? In the photo she\u2019s wearing a bulletproof vest. I don\u2019t believe the intention was to grab breasts, but to make a really stupid joke. Not cool, but not really groping, either.\u201d\u201cI am not going to let Franken off just because he\u2019s a Democrat. But in our criminal justice system we realize there are differences between misdemeanors, felonies, second-degree vs. first-degree murder, etc.\u201cThis witch hunt where anyone that has made an off-color joke at any point in their life needs to be purged is ridiculous. Saying that we should hunt for the head of Al Franken is crazy. If other women come forward, then I\u2019ll change my tune. But not every man (or woman) who flirts, makes an off-color joke or makes a pass at someone else (especially when they gracefully take no for an answer) is guilty of sexual assault.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to condone Al Franken\u2019s behavior, but let\u2019s keep in mind where this is coming from. Leeann Tweeden is a politically conservative newscaster who\u2019s appeared on Fox News with Sean Hannity and on Redeye. Before she became a newscaster she was a model, doing promotional work for Hooters, Venus International and Frederick\u2019s of Hollywood. Fox News and right-wing Republicans have never shown any true concern for a woman\u2019s right to be free from harassment such as this. They\u2019re simply exploiting a real concern to attack liberal and progressive leaders.\u201d\u201cMen. Are you finally waking up? Are you finally starting to see that there is a pervasive culture of disrespect and entitlement toward women by men of all political persuasions, socioeconomic statuses and education levels? It is time for American men to take a long look in the mirror and adjust their actions.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Tax Bills Would Reward Companies That Moved Money Offshore", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past few decades, some of the largest companies in the United States made a big bet: By stashing hundreds of billions of dollars of profits offshore, they could slash their taxes and bolster their profits.It would take a generation to see if the strategy would fully pay off, because the law allowed companies only to defer the taxes on overseas earnings, not to permanently avoid them. Would they ever be able to bring the profits back to the United States without incurring huge tax bills?Some 20 years after the tax-avoiding technique became widespread, it is poised to pay off in a big way. The Republican tax bills making their way through the House and Senate would allow companies to bring nearly $3 trillion in profits home, at greatly reduced tax rates.In a tax-overhaul package that would provide the greatest benefits to wealthy individuals and corporations, the so-called repatriation provision stands out. It would give companies a permanent tax break of about half a trillion dollars, rewarding the likes of Google, Apple, Pfizer and General Electric. Corporate America claims that about $3 trillion in profits were generated in places like Bermuda, Grand Cayman and Luxembourg.The tax breaks for bringing home such offshore profits \u201cconfirm the central tenet of tax planning that a tax deferred is a tax avoided,\u201d said David Miller, a tax lawyer at Proskauer Rose. \u201cFor decades, U.S. multinationals have shifted profits abroad and deferred their taxes on them. If either of the tax bills pass, they will be rewarded for doing so.\u201dTo be sure, the legislation erects some potential guardrails against future efforts to shift profits offshore. It would establish a minimum tax abroad on certain types of income \u2014 at least 10 percent for the first several years in the Senate version \u2014 thus raising the tax bills for many companies on their foreign profits. And regulators in Europe and elsewhere abroad have accelerated their efforts to crack down on such profit shifting out of their countries.President Trump and congressional Republicans argue that it\u2019s important to get companies to bring the money home because it would be used to create jobs \u2014 although that didn\u2019t happen the last time lawmakers enacted a similar tax break. Mr. Trump predicted on Tuesday that trillions of dollars would be repatriated \u2014 money, he said, that companies currently are \u201cjust not able to bring back.\u201dUnder current law, American companies pay taxes on their worldwide profits at a rate of 35 percent, the highest statutory rate in the world. But the law has a big caveat: Companies can indefinitely defer the taxes on profits earned abroad \u2014 as long as those profits stay overseas.That gives companies a powerful incentive to push as much profit as possible into subsidiaries abroad. Microsoft, Merck, Facebook and other companies attribute large chunks of their profits to entities in low- or zero-tax offshore jurisdictions and therefore enjoy effective tax rates that are nowhere near 35 percent.But companies can defer the American taxes only as long as their profits remain offshore. If they want to repatriate the cash back to the United States, they must pay taxes at the rate of 35 percent, minus whatever they already paid abroad.A large loophole was opened in 1996 when the Clinton administration\u2019s Treasury Department introduced a rule that allowed different subsidiaries of the same company to move money back and forth without incurring American taxes.That removed one of the main deterrents to companies pushing profits into overseas tax havens \u2014 and opened the floodgates. Since then, the share of American companies\u2019 foreign profits attributed to a handful of tax havens has more than doubled. Now, nearly two-thirds of all profits that American companies claim to earn overseas are generated in tax-friendly jurisdictions including Bermuda, Ireland and the Netherlands, according to data compiled by Gabriel Zucman, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.The problem for corporate America, though, is that it can\u2019t easily use that overseas money for things like paying dividends or buying their own shares, techniques that publicly traded companies use to please their investors. Doing so would trigger hefty tax bills.After intense lobbying by big companies, Congress in 2004 passed the American Jobs Creation Act, which provided a one-time tax break for companies that wanted to repatriate their offshore profits. Companies brought home $312 billion at a rate of just 5.25 percent. Although the break was intended to spur investment and hiring, a plethora of studies showed that companies responded by spending billions buying back their shares, lifting their stock prices, and didn\u2019t expand their American work forces.Pfizer, for example, brought home $37 billion at the reduced rates \u2014 and shed 10,000 workers. Hewlett-Packard repatriated more than $14 billion, while eliminating more than 14,000 jobs.After that tax break, companies resumed pushing profits offshore \u2014 at an even brisker pace. Early in the Obama administration, Cisco Systems led a lobbying effort for yet another tax holiday, which went nowhere.Now, companies have accumulated approximately $2.8 trillion in profits offshore, beyond the reach of American tax authorities and barely touched by other countries, according to the Zion Research Group, a research boutique focused on accounting and tax issues.The proposals in the Republican tax package are different from the 2004 holiday. Under the current versions, all foreign earnings sitting offshore would be considered to be automatically repatriated, and taxes at a reduced rate would be paid over several years. The rates would vary, with earnings held in cash taxed at 10 percent in the Senate version. Other earnings would be taxed at half that rate. Companies would receive credit for some foreign taxes already paid.Zion Research estimated that under the Senate proposal, companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 would pay about $570 billion less than what they would if they brought the profits home under current law.American companies would no longer owe full taxes on overseas profits. Instead, they would pay taxes at a minimum rate of at least 10 percent on some types of foreign profits \u2014 compared with a new, lower rate on domestic earnings of 20 percent.Kristin J. Forbes, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s management school who served in the George W. Bush administration, said the repeated changes to the tax treatment of overseas earning were problematic.\u201cThey do cause companies to change behavior and then game the system the way they have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBig picture: This isn\u2019t how you\u2019d like to do tax policy.\u201dJim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Deli Where Rye Comes in Slices and in a Glass", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Nov. 27, the brothers Jeremy and Josh Lebewohl, who own the storied Jewish deli on First Avenue, plan to open 2nd Floor, a cocktail lounge just above the restaurant, with a separate entrance on East 75th Street.This is fairly uncharted territory for Jewish delicatessens. In 1997, the owners of Ratner\u2019s, the famous kosher dairy restaurant on Delancey Street that is now closed, opened a speakeasy in the back called Lansky Lounge. But delis are usually not associated with sophisticated drinking.Jeremy Lebewohl thought he was within his rights to break new ground.\u201cOn 33rd Street, our goal was to continue the tradition of Second Avenue Deli,\u201d he said, mentioning the other branch of the mini-chain, which opened in 2007, one year after the closing of the original location, on Second Avenue. \u201cHere, we have a little more freedom.\u201dThe bar will be unusual in that the liquid menu is certified kosher. Also, some ingredients are not ones you\u2019re likely to find at any other cocktail bar in town. Man-O-Manischewitz, a riff on the gin cocktail called the Bramble, uses a syrup made from Manischewitz wine rather than the traditional cr\u00e8me de m\u00fbre. The Upper Eastsider, a long drink that can be made with gin or vodka, has Dr. Brown\u2019s Cel-Ray soda as a component. A drink called the Shofar, similar to a Jack Rose, is made up of ingredients whose flavors are associated with Rosh Hashana, including apple brandy, pomegranate (in the form of grenadine) and honey.\u201cWe felt it was appropriate to use those ingredients that are ingrained in Jewish culture,\u201d said Jason Jeffords III, the beverage director. \u201cWe wanted to make sure they found their way on the menu, because you might not see them at other places.\u201dThat includes slivovitz, the plum brandy common to Eastern Europe. Seldom used in cocktails, it will play a starring role in the Improved Slivovitz Cocktail. (Of course, you can order a plain old martini or old-fashioned, too.)The space, which seats roughly 100, is designed to look as if it\u2019s been there for years, with wooden floors, club chairs and an old tin ceiling. In the bathroom area, there are framed photos and posters of old Yiddish theater stars, a nod to the deli\u2019s original location in the heart of the now-vanished Yiddish theater district.A food menu, different from the one downstairs, is meant to feel modern while honoring the deli\u2019s culinary traditions. Dishes by the chef, David Teyf, include Herring Three Ways, with three differently flavored, sushi-like bits of herring, and Veal Pelmeni Two Ways, dumplings served in both fried and boiled forms, the latter in broth.To Jeremy Lebewohl\u2019s mind, of course the bar would have good food. \u201cWe wanted to have a beverage program,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, at the same time, we\u2019re the Second Avenue Deli.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How You Can Help Prevent Mass Shootings", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn the summer of 2013, I led a briefing with Attorney General Eric Holder on the F.B.I.\u2019s research on active-shooter incidents in the United States. Our meeting took place just months after a gunman massacred six adults and 20 children at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\u201cIf these were deaths from terrorist acts, the American public would be outraged,\u201d Mr. Holder said. I couldn\u2019t disagree.Four years later, his observation still haunts me. Last month, 59 people were mowed down in Las Vegas at a country music concert. This week, we are facing the gut-wrenching news that an 18-month-old child is among the 26 dead in a Texas church. Yet we are still asking the same question we did after Sandy Hook: \u201cHow can we stop this carnage?\u201dThe answer, in part, requires us to look at our own role.In the weeks and months after Sept. 11, 2001, Americans were laser-focused on their surroundings, galvanized and determined to prevent another attack. We were more afraid. I know I was.Fear is not comfortable, but it does make us more aware. After Sept. 11, Americans called F.B.I. offices and police departments when they saw something suspicious. They stopped beat officers on patrol if they saw a package unattended. \u201cSee something, say something,\u201d may not be a rousing battle cry, but it works: Many of these tips resulted in terrorist plots foiled, including several in New York City.Yet Americans have not responded similarly to the uniquely American event of mass shootings. For five years, I led the F.B.I.\u2019s studies of how to prevent, respond and recover from these incidents. Emergency medical workers are now far better prepared to take action and help survivors. It is prevention that remains the challenge.We see and know more about one another\u2019s day-to-day lives than ever before. Yet our research shows that 15 years ago an active-shooter incident occurred every two months. These days, we are seeing one every two weeks. The nation\u2019s 800,000 law enforcement officers cannot stem this tide of destruction without the engagement of the country\u2019s 300 million citizens. Unless public engagement replaces our collective passivity, mass shootings will continue.Targeted violence falls into two major categories: impulsive and planned. The former comes with little or no warning and is often set off by a workplace or family trauma. This kind of attack may result in fewer casualties, but it is extremely difficult to do anything to prevent it. The same is not true of planned attacks, which provide opportunities for intervention.Law enforcement routinely derails brittle individuals on the pathway to violence thanks to brave and concerned family members, friends, neighbors, teachers and co-workers who sounded the alarm. But sometimes, the call is not made. I didn\u2019t want to get someone in trouble, we hear. I didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed. I didn\u2019t want to seem hysterical.These excuses don\u2019t fly in an era of regular mass shootings. No one has a right to bystander apathy.If there is any hesitation, err on the side of over-reporting. Law enforcement will sort it out. If you don\u2019t want to call the police, call a school counselor, a clergy member, your human resources department or the place where the person works. An anonymous call can save lives.If you run a business, a school, a church or an organization, make sure everyone involved knows how and where to report information. If you don\u2019t have a reporting and threat-assessment strategy, get one.Prevention is more about attitude than tactics. Changes in laws and policies are important, but without an urgent increase in citizen awareness and reporting, innocent people will continue to die. To prevent these shootings, Americans need to be as motivated as they were after the morning of Sept. 11, when no one knew who would be the next victim.Katherine Schweit, a retired F.B.I. special agent, is a security consultant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trump for All Ages", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo People Like Show PeopleThe conventions industry pays big bucks for impersonators. How do they solve a problem like The Donald?Randy Nolen is a 66-year-old talent manager based in Indian Wells, Calif. He specializes in the meetings and conventions sector. His clients seek acts that can entertain, say, a thousand conference attendees who have nothing in common except that they work in the insurance industry. Long ago, Mr. Nolen realized that everyone knows the president of the United States, and everyone likes to make fun of the boss. Thus, his bread and butter for the last 25 years has been booking and managing performers who portray the president. In the 1990s, he did well with a natural Bill Clinton look-alike named Tim Watters. In the 2000s, he hit it big with Steve Bridges, who used elaborate facial prosthetics to transform into a striking likeness of George W. Bush.While the corporate clients want unique and memorable performers, they generally don\u2019t want anything risqu\u00e9 or offensive. That\u2019s why the buzzword that guides Mr. Nolen is \u201crespectful.\u201d He encourages the entertainers he represents to \u201cpoke fun\u201d at the president, in a clever but civil way. \u201cOur objective is to make people chuckle and say, \u2018Gosh, that was fun,\u2019\u201d Mr. Nolen said. \u201cWe\u2019re not political people. We\u2019re not going to change any policy with this. We\u2019re entertainers. Our job is to make everybody laugh, in a way that even the president and his family will like.\u201dA decade ago, Mr. Nolen achieved that with Mr. Bridges, who performed alongside Mr. Bush at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in 2006, and also at a private birthday party at the White House. According to Mr. Nolen, George H.W. Bush approached Mr. Bridges after his show, saying, \u201cSteve, I just want to thank you. Your material is so gracious.\u201d\u201cAlec Baldwin is playing a buffoon,\u201d he said. \u201cAnthony Atamanuik is meanspirited. It\u2019s like Dr. Evil. It\u2019s a demonlike character. The problem is, that\u2019s not Trump. You\u2019re playing him out of character and it\u2019s not believable.\u201dIn the early 1990s, Mr. Nolen had no interest in look-alikes. \u201cThere was no money in it,\u201d he said. Because they showed up, waved, and then did meet-and-greets, the appearance fees they could command were limited. \u201cThey were getting $500 to $750 a night.\u201dThen, a colleague of Mr. Nolen\u2019s insisted he meet a former real estate salesman named Tim Watters, who had started making appearances at corporate events because of his resemblance to America\u2019s new president, Bill Clinton. When Mr. Nolen\u2019s acquaintance spotted Mr. Watters at a Motorola conference, he said the executives there were practically falling over themselves to get a photo with him. While Mr. Nolen was skeptical, he agreed to meet with Mr. Watters. \u201cFrom the nose up, he looked exactly like Bill Clinton,\u201d Mr. Nolen said.That still wasn\u2019t enough. But when Mr. Watters agreed to develop an actual stand-up act that would allow him to charge more for performances, Mr. Nolen started booking gigs for him.In their best year together, 1996, Mr. Nolen said he booked 177 dates for Mr. Watters at $10,000 a performance. When President Clinton was re-elected that year, Mr. Nolen urged Mr. Watters to expand his act, from 30 to 45 minutes, so that they could increase their fee. \u201cMost convention and meetings planners want a full hour if they can get it,\u201d Mr. Nolen said.But Mr. Watters didn\u2019t want to invest the money into writers who could help expand his act. \u201cThat\u2019s when I said, \u2018If I ever do this again, I\u2019m going to find a guy who\u2019s got the will and the talent, and then I\u2019m going to find a prosthetic makeup artist and make him look like the president,\u2019\u201d Mr. Nolen said.Squint, and you might say Don Jr. Mr. Burleigh has brown hair, hazel eyes, round cheeks and a puckish grin. At 48, he still looks boyish.That started to change, however, as Kevin Haney, a Hollywood makeup artist, retrieved an individually cast silicone ear, an individually cast silicone eye bag and so on, and methodically covered Mr. Burleigh in a thin layer of Trump. \u201cWhat is the toxicity of this stuff?\u201d Mr. Burleigh asked, as Mr. Haney brushed a Q-tip dipped in denatured alcohol against the silicone replica of Donald Trump\u2019s left cheek glued to Mr. Burleigh\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s all medical grade \u2014 completely safe,\u201d Mr. Haney said.Recruited by Mr. Nolen more than a year ago, Mr. Burleigh has made three brief appearances as President Trump at Southern California comedy clubs. Now, Mr. Haney is prepping him for his first official paid gig in the role, a private party in a restaurant.Over the course of his long career, Mr. Haney has helped transform actors into monsters, aliens, apes, corpses and extremely old versions of themselves. In 1990, he was part of the makeup team that won an Oscar for their work in \u201cDriving Miss Daisy.\u201d He turned Courteney Cox into \u201cFat Monica\u201d on \u201cFriends.\u201dNo character, however, has ever challenged him like Mr. Trump has.\u201cHe has so many angles. He has so many odd things going on,\u201d Mr. Haney said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most difficult job I\u2019ve ever done. I say this without any hesitation.\u201dMr. Nolen believes he can blame it all on James B. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I.Like many people, Mr. Nolen had started paying attention to the 2016 presidential election well before the primaries got underway, though his interest was driven by a tragedy several years earlier.While Steve Bridges\u2019s busiest year as President Bush was in 2006, he continued to get jobs for this portrayal well after Mr. Bush left office. In 2012, days after the 48-year-old Mr. Bridges had returned from playing Mr. Bush in China, he died unexpectedly.\u201cIt was a complete shock,\u201d Mr. Nolen said. \u201cHis brother told me the official coroner\u2019s report said it was anaphylactic reaction, caused by a chemical in an herb.\u201dIn the two years afterward, Mr. Nolen tried to develop other acts built around what he calls \u201clikeness prosthetics,\u201d but nothing came to fruition. He decided to get an early jump on the 2016 election. \u201cI really thought Hillary was going to get indicted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe server thing. There was so much against her.\u201d And when that happened, he reasoned, the Democrats would have to replace her with a last-minute stand-in. So Mr. Nolen started looking for someone who could play Joe Biden. Mr. Burleigh, who impersonates a wide range of Hollywood celebrities, had never thought to include Joe Biden in his act. But he did know all about the success Steve Bridges had playing George W. Bush. At his peak, Mr. Bridges had earned far more to play the president than the president himself earned in salary for the job.Anticipating a similar payday, Mr. Burleigh signed a contract with Mr. Nolen.\u201cRandy had me over for dinner when I was doing a show in Palm Springs,\u201d Mr. Burleigh said. \u201cHe took out the contracts we\u2019d written a year and a half earlier. And wherever it said \u2018Joe Biden,\u2019 he just crossed it out and wrote \u2018Donald Trump.\u2019\u201dOn Election Day, Mr. Burleigh was on a cruise ship in the Caribbean, drinking in the crew bar at 4 a.m., after performing a gig that night. \u201cThere were all these people from all these different countries, just baffled,\u201d he said. \u201cThis big Russian guy was sitting next to me, and he goes, \u2018Now let me get this straight. This Donald Trump, he is reality star, yes?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 And he said, \u2018And he\u2019s going to be president of the United States, yes?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, it looks that way.\u2019 And he gets this big smile on his face and says, \u2018Only in America!\u2019\u201dThe first time that Mr. Haney built a new face for Mr. Burleigh in July, Mr. Burleigh thought he ended up looking more like Liberace than Donald Trump. \u201cRandy kept saying, \u2018This is just a test.\u2019 But I was worried,\u201d Mr. Burleigh said.The second time, one of the other comics at the club where Mr. Burleigh performed just sat there and glared at him. \u201cShe was looking at Dave like he was some evil creature,\u201d Mr. Nolen said.With Mr. Bridges, Mr. Haney got so good at simulating the look of Mr. Bush that people sometimes thought they were meeting the actual president when shaking his hand. Mr. Burleigh is not at that level yet, but in the meet-and-greets he has done, he said people are already addressing him as if he is the president: \u201c\u2018I didn\u2019t vote for you,\u2019 they\u2019ll say, \u2018but my mom\u2019s going to love this picture.\u2019\u201dTo achieve even that level of verisimilitude takes around four hours and a great deal of patience. As Mr. Haney blended the edges of various silicone pieces, Mr. Burleigh held a small red fan to his face to mitigate the fumes from the solvents.\u201cCan I get a tissue here?\u201d he asked. \u201cMy eye is sizzling a bit.\u201dOnce Mr. Haney finished applying the silicone, he started using a low-pressure spray gun to speckle it with tiny dots of color \u2014 mostly reds, pinks and browns. \u201cI\u2019ve done the super-orange Trump makeup on a couple other jobs,\u201d Mr. Haney said. \u201cBut it\u2019s distracting. I try to give a hint of that, but I don\u2019t overdo it. I\u2019m not going to make him into an Oompa Loompa. It\u2019s not that kind of show.\u201dMr. Burleigh, too, has no intention of turning Mr. Trump into an Oompa Loompa.\u201cWhen all of this started, I was at lunch with one of my comedian friends and I told him about the project,\u201d Mr. Burleigh said. \u201cAnd he goes, \u2018Well, if you can sleep at night.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Comedians have been doing impressions of politicians forever, all the way back to the jesters and the kings. This is a form of entertainment.\u2019 Then, he kind of gave it a beat and said, \u2018Well, just don\u2019t humanize him.\u2019\u201dSteve Bridges certainly did that with George W. Bush. Indeed, as President Bush\u2019s approval ratings dropped in the face of endless war and a slowing economy, Mr. Bridges\u2019s popularity grew.And, according to Mr. Nolen, his core audience was conservatives and Republicans, not liberals. In his portrayal of Mr. Bush as an endearing, simple, but occasionally sly regular guy, Mr. Bridges gave them a Dubya unsaddled by history \u2014 the folksy blue-blood cowboy who had once promised to help \u201cmake the pie higher\u201d and sympathized with how hard it was for average Americans to \u201cput food on their families.\u201dIn the Trump era, when it sometimes feels as if we are no more than a tweet away from nuclear war, civil war or nuclear civil war, there are millions of people who have zero interest in a similarly sympathetic depiction of Mr. Trump. And there are millions of people who are no doubt tired of seeing Mr. Trump depicted only as a sour buffoon or an evil mastermind. In a recent tweet, the president himself pressed for \u201cEqual Time\u201d on the nation\u2019s late-night TV shows.Now that possibility exists.At 5:38 p.m., Mr. Haney finally stepped away from Mr. Burleigh. After sitting with low-energy calm for more than three and a half hours, Mr. Burleigh burst into motion. He ducked into a nearby closet, where he put on a fat suit that gives him a pot belly and some larger-than-average junk in the trunk. Finally, Mr. Burleigh slid on a wig that is essentially a horseshoe-like fringe of white-blond hair that leaves the top of his head bald.It\u2019s temporary \u2014 he is having a better one made, at a cost of $10,000, by a wig maker who has designed pieces for Cher and Jennifer Aniston. Her services are in such high demand that she won\u2019t be able to complete it for several weeks. As Mr. Burleigh exited the hotel lobby and started to walk down the street, diners inside a nearby restaurant spotted him through the window and whipped out their cellphones to take photos. Passers-by slowed and did double takes.After a couple of blocks, Mr. Burleigh broke left with statesmanlike authority, toward the staff entrance of the 555 East American Steakhouse. As he waited outside for his cue to enter, Mari Okumura, Mr. Haney\u2019s assistant, dabbed at the left side of Mr. Burleigh\u2019s face in a last-minute attempt to improve the contouring of his plump, patrician jowl.Ten yards away, two women from the Netherlands looked on from a polite distance. \u201cWe were wondering, is it him?\u201d one said. \u201cWe thought maybe he is here for the wildfires?\u201d A few minutes later, Mr. Burleigh strode into a private banquet room to the strains of \u201cHail to the Chief.\u201dApproximately 30 men, middle-aged and up, filled tables. Some showed obvious delight at the appearance of their surprise visitor.\u201cGood to be here. Great to be here,\u201d Mr. Burleigh purred from behind a podium at the front of the room. \u201cI was expecting more people. My birthday party had a billion people.\u201cA lot of traffic getting down here tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t these Hollywood liberals promise to leave the country if I got elected? Liars!\u201dMr. Burleigh played the president in his schmoozy, self-satisfied M.C. mode \u2014 not rousing the rabble so much as nuzzling it. And when Mr. Burleigh closed his act by singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to the 80-year-old guest of honor, everyone in the room joined in with great strength and stamina, buoyed by the bonhomie of Mr. Burleigh\u2019s engaging presence.It was a winning performance, with a notable subtext. Not just because Mr. Burleigh effectively sanitized the president by avoiding topics of any controversy, but also in the way he elevated him. He did not insult protesting athletes, or belittle a Puerto Rico mayor, or feud with war widows. Here at last was a leader with all of the discipline, decorum and empathy that many have traditionally associated with the office of the president. For the meetings and conventions sector, that\u2019s fantastic news.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Ease of Monrovia\u2019s \u2018Hipco\u2019 Clubs", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe lookAt a nightclub in Liberia, the photographer Yagazie Emezi found a stylish music scene unencumbered by the country\u2019s past.Walk into Code: 146 on a Friday or Saturday night and you\u2019ll find it packed with Liberian locals and expats who go there to hear aspiring artists at the club\u2019s popular open-mic night.\u201cEverybody was there to have a good time,\u201d said the Nigerian-born photographer Yagazie Emezi, who found herself returning to the club time and again during a 10-month trip to Liberia in the summer. \u201cRegardless of what they were going through, people came to express the best versions of themselves, from their clothes to their performances. It didn\u2019t really matter how much money they had.\u201dThroughout the club, the bright green walls are decorated with the quotation \u201cKeep Hipco Burning,\u201d a nod to the country\u2019s take on American rap, which is performed in Liberian pidgin English. The club\u2019s founder, Jonathan Koffa, known as Takun J, is one of Liberia\u2019s most prominent hipco artists and uses his music to advance social justice causes.Takun J was among the few club owners in his country who kept their doors open during the height of the Ebola crisis in 2014, which left more than 4,800 Liberians dead. Residents of West Point, the country\u2019s largest township, less than a 10-minute drive away, suffered the worst of the disease and were restricted under quarantine and an evening curfew. Instead of shutting his doors, Takun J installed a permanent hand-washing station on the main floor, routinely cleaned the space with bleach and discouraged people from getting too close to each other.Ms. Emezi, 28, said that it was hard to imagine that less than four years ago the country was under such dire conditions. During the open-mic performances, many of the artists made no mention of their county\u2019s past struggles, but instead focused their lyrics on making money and rising above their circumstances. Even their clothing, which appeared to be inspired by 1990s American hip-hop fashion, had a lightness to it.Adrienne Tingba went to Code: 146 to discover new artists. After graduating from Temple University in Philadelphia, she returned home and now works as the executive assistant at the Liberia Coca-Cola Bottling Company. When Ms. Emezi met her, she was wearing a black leather miniskirt with a sparkled camisole tucked in, with her hair in a braided cornrow style with loosely curled ends.Ms. Emezi also noticed references to the American flag on articles of clothing, including one attendee who wore an oversize leather jacket with a small flag patch adorning his sleeve. \u201cThe people of Liberia know their history and remember their past,\u201d Ms. Emezi said. \u201cThere is definitely a clear relationship between America and Liberia. Liberians take that influence and make it their own.\u201dBraids, hair extensions, trendy colors and dreadlocks were also worn by both the women and men Ms. Emezi met, including one clubgoer who layered short blond hair extensions with her natural black hair.Rockstar, a popular Liberian choreographer and dancer, layered patterns and textures for his look. \u201cLiberians are just stylish,\u201d he told Ms. Emezi, right before another hipco artist took the stage. \u201cWe have a way of dressing to express ourselves.\u201d Unexpected details also caught Ms. Emezi\u2019s attention, including one male performer who was wearing a red T-shirt with a watering flower pot, accented with a gold chain. She also noticed an older waitress at the club in brocade patterned pants that had Mickey Mouse\u2019s likeness printed just below her kneecaps.\u201cThere were these weird combinations of graphic pictures and patterns on the clothes, but you could tell people had thoughtfully considered their look,\u201d Ms. Emezi said.\u201cThis is the place that I started and wanted to raise Liberia up as a nation,\u201d he told Ms. Emezi one night after he performed. \u201cI want to raise Liberia up through music.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the duration of the photographer's stay in Liberia. It was 10 months, not four.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Near Future of Driving: Eyes Forward, but No Hands at 10 and 2", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsI am tapping this into my iPhone while sitting at the wheel of a 2018 Cadillac CT6 luxury sedan, rolling along a shade under 75 miles per hour on Interstate 94 about 20 miles west of Ann Arbor, Mich.I am not texting and driving, because, technically, I am not driving the car. The car is.Using a radar sensor, cameras, GPS positioning and a highly precise digital map, the CT6\u2019s Super Cruise driver-assistance system is handling all of the braking, accelerating and steering as I continue heading west to a lunch appointment in South Bend, Ind., 170 miles away.That leaves me free to sit back and type these words \u2014 and do much more that would otherwise be considered unsafe \u2014 as the mile markers zip by.Self-driving cars will soon be a reality. Waymo, the autonomous-car division of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is already testing hundreds of self-driving vehicles around the country. The ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft and big automakers including General Motors, Ford Motor and Audi are developing their own technology and test fleets.So on this brisk November day, my hands-free road trip with Super Cruise offered a glimpse into that future \u2014 a world in which the grinding daily commute will transform into quiet time, and long drives can become productive hours on the road.Super Cruise was introduced in September and is General Motors\u2019 answer to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, the best known of the semiautonomous driving systems that have arrived in the past two years. Neither Autopilot nor Super Cruise is fully autonomous \u2014 both require drivers to remain alert and prepared to take control at any time.But Super Cruise has one big advantage: Unlike Autopilot, it does not require you to keep your hands on the steering wheel. As I\u2019m typing this, a camera mounted on the steering column is monitoring my eyes and head. As long as I glance up every so often, Super Cruise knows that I\u2019m keeping an eye on the road.For more than an hour, Super Cruise pilots the car with no input from me \u2014 no steering, no braking and no acceleration. In that time, I cover 65 miles. With my hands free, I scroll through Twitter and Facebook. I log into my bank account and read the headlines from The New York Times.As long as I look up at the road about every three seconds, Super Cruise remains in command, maintaining a safe following distance and easing the Cadillac through the freeway\u2019s contours. When Super Cruise is engaged, a thin light strip on the top of the steering wheel appears green. If I look away longer than three seconds, it flashes to bring my gaze back on the highway. If I fail to do so, the light strip turns red and the driver\u2019s seat vibrates, telling me to take control.That has happened only once so far. To get Super Cruise back, I need only look forward and place my hands on the wheel. After a few seconds, the light strip turns green again, and my hands are free to go back to the iPhone.I quickly learn how to glance regularly at the road. My host in South Bend, my cousin Pat, calls me using the video chat function in Facebook Messenger. I hold the phone up over the steering wheel so that I can see Pat on the screen while keeping my gaze looking forward, ensuring Super Cruise remains in control.All the while, the CT6 stays centered in the left lane of I-94. But if I want to change lanes or to pass other cars, I take the wheel myself and steer the car over. The light strip turns blue, indicating I\u2019m temporarily overriding Super Cruise. Once the car is in the new lane, the strip goes back to green and I\u2019m hands-free again. It decelerates when approaching slower vehicles. When the road clears, it accelerates back up to the speed I\u2019ve selected: 74 m.p.h., four over the speed limit.At one point, a car merging onto the highway scoots in front of me. Super Cruise responds quickly and brakes. I sense no danger of a collision.G.M. is careful to specify that it is not promoting Super Cruise as a way to let drivers text, Google or open a newspaper on the highway. \u201cWe don\u2019t recommend it,\u201d said Lisa Sieradski, global product manager for the CT6. \u201cIt will allow you to glance down at a phone or the radio, but you have to return your eyes to the road.\u201dNonetheless, using the same video-chatting method, I watch a four-minute highlight video from a Rangers game. (They beat the Bruins, 4-2.) I also conduct a phone interview, taking notes with a pen and a pad. When my trip ended, I had covered 378 miles. My hands were on the wheel for no more than 25 of them.Ms. Sieradski said G.M. had tried to engineer Super Cruise to keep drivers safe \u2014 and limit opportunities to use the system improperly \u2014 by restricting how and where they could use it. The system will not operate at speeds above 85 mile per hour, for example.And Super Cruise can be activated only on divided, limited-access highways such as interstates \u2014 places where it need not contend with intersections, traffic lights and pedestrians. The system determines its exact location by relying on high-precision digital maps and GPS technology, while sensors track the surrounding traffic \u2014 the way sensors do for driver aides like adaptive cruise control. The system is able to determine when the car is on a service road along the highway, or even on entry and exit ramps \u2014 locations where it requires you to steer yourself.But when the Super Cruise system senses it is on an approved road, a white steering wheel icon appears on the instrument panel. Press a button, and the green bar lights up and the system takes over.For now, Super Cruise is available only on the 2018 CT6. Dealers in Michigan are offering the car with the option for about $73,000.The ability to cruise on the highway hands-free is a major step forward. For many drivers, systems that require them to keep their hands on the steering wheel seem almost self-defeating. What\u2019s the point of having the car steer itself if your hands have to stay on the wheel?While driving the CT6 over several days, I found it was actually more pleasing to leave my phone alone. One morning at rush hour, I sat quietly with my hands on my knees, sipping a latte as though I were relaxing on my couch.On the return leg of my South Bend trip, I turned on the back massager built into the CT6\u2019s driver\u2019s seat. From my phone, I piped a new-age meditation through the CT6\u2019s sound system.As I stared at the truck ahead of me, and the seat kneaded my lower back, I crossed the border into the state of Zen. The voice on the meditation intoned: \u201cYou are feeling relaxed and calm.\u201dFor two hours and 120 miles, I was.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India\u2019s Gay Rights Activists Seize Momentum After Landmark Ruling", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 At a jammed intersection in New Delhi, a passing parade of people announced their mission with a single word in Hindi, dicing it into short, snappy syllables.\u201cAzadi!\u201d or freedom, the crowd chanted as drivers leaned out of their rickshaws, straining to hear. One of the marchers, Rishi Raj Vyas, 16, filled in the blanks.\u201cWe are here to break stereotypes,\u201d he said, \u201cto tell Delhi that we are here and we are queer.\u201dHe was one of several thousand participants in Delhi\u2019s annual gay pride parade who gathered on a smoggy afternoon this month to march, cheer and dance Bhangra through the streets of the city.Anand Grover, a lawyer leading the effort to overturn Section 377, said the privacy ruling was keeping him busy.\u201cThis is another nail in the coffin, the privacy judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to win. I don\u2019t lose my optimism.\u201dDepictions of gender-fluid identity are common in ancient texts found in Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. In Hinduism, gods transform into goddesses, or they cross-dress. Men become pregnant.Today, many Indians object to homosexuality not so much on moral grounds, but because of the pressure to marry someone of the opposite sex. Marriage is often framed as a social pact between two families in India.\u201cUnlike in the West, where religion is organized, and even homophobia seems institutionalized, in India, all of this is very fluid,\u201d Mr. Pattanaik said. \u201cThe only major issue is marriage. People want men and women to marry, no matter what their sexual orientation.\u201dIntroduced in 1861, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code imposes a 10-year prison sentence on \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature with man, woman or animal.\u201d The law most often applies to sex between men, but extends to heterosexuals engaging in \u201cpenile, nonvaginal sexual acts,\u201d said Mr. Grover, the lawyer.According to the privacy judgment, about 200 people have been prosecuted under Section 377.\u201cOur biggest problem is communities and families who say, \u2018Look, if you\u2019re telling me that this is such a normal, natural thing, why is it a criminal act?\u2019 \u201d she said from her office at the Naz Foundation.With August\u2019s privacy ruling, Ms. Gopalan said that she is again hopeful. A type of appeal known as a curative petition has already been filed against Section 377, and a verdict could be delivered as early as next year.\u201cWomen\u2019s sexuality is not talked about, not discussed, nothing, ever,\u201d Ms. Gopalan said.But Rovin Sharma, 23, a self-described drag queen, said that gender issues are still rudimentarily understood in India. Mx. Sharma, who prefers the gender-neutral Mx. in place of Mr. or Ms., told of being forced to resign from a job recently after attempting to use the women\u2019s restroom there.\u201cThere\u2019s no space for me,\u201d Mx. Sharma said.Those issues momentarily took a back seat at the parade, the 10th to be held in Delhi, as sections of the crowd unfurled a large rainbow flag. This year, fewer participants wore face masks to hide their identities at the parade, which included a smattering of Westerners.Adam Willems, 22, who was born in New York City but calls India home, said Delhi\u2019s parade was refreshingly anticapitalist, if still \u201cvery Anglophone,\u201d by which he meant it was largely attended by English-speaking, educated Indians. Mr. Willems noted that Delhi\u2019s pride organizers have resisted integrating corporate sponsors.\u201cYou don\u2019t see \u2018Tata likes the gays,\u2019 \u201d he said, referring to one of India\u2019s largest business conglomerates. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Google. You don\u2019t see Facebook. That\u2019s on purpose.\u201dIt was getting late as the parade fanned around the final focal point, a stage where volunteers from the crowd ascended the platform to read poems they had written about coming out crushes and hopes for the future.In the crowd was Ashish Chopra, 22, who had traveled from the city of Pune, more than 700 miles away, to attend the parade. Wearing rainbow suspenders and holding the hand of his mother, Simmi Nanda, 50, Mr. Chopra said he was surprised by how few parents had shown up. He began to cry, casting a long look at his mother.\u201cI really wanted my mom to come for this,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, there was a lot of drama. She was not ready to come, but even after all that, she managed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a new thing for us,\u201d Ms. Nanda said. \u201cBut still, I am trying.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Helping or hurting democracy is incidental to that goal, as are improving or degrading our daily lives, or making the world a better or worse place.Social media may be only as harmful as we allow it to be, but as to whether social media is a force for good, as is so often claimed, I would ask this: How many people working in the industry would still be there if their jobs paid the same as, say, teaching or social work?Don\u2019t ask about the intentions, aspirations or responsibilities of social media companies. Just follow the money. That\u2019s the real story.To the Editor:Emily Parker repeats industry ideas about individual responsibility and a faith in self-regulating systems. Manipulation, however, is a feature, not a bug, in many of the products and platforms that companies like Google and Facebook design. It is in fact the premise of the advertising businesses that account for some 90 percent of their revenue.Discreet changes to the underlying algorithms of these platforms have immense power over what is seen by users but, more important, they affect what goes unseen.But Silicon Valley corporations are willfully opaque in explaining how and where their algorithms work, what their objectives are and whom they are ultimately benefiting.To call these platforms \u201ca mirror\u201d fails to acknowledge the role that ideology plays in their construction and the power Big Tech has to determine the winners and losers in our society.JASON FRIEDMAN, BROOKLYNTo the Editor:I found the suggested \u201cfixes\u201d to Facebook et al. unhelpful, focused on technical tweaks or appeals to somehow make us nicer or more knowledgeable.Facebook, Twitter and so forth are publishers of readers\u2019 posts. The closest comparison to them is perhaps the letters column of The New York Times. You \u201ccurate\u201d your letters page very carefully; so should they.It is no excuse to protest that they simply have too much \u201cink\u201d to ever be able to do this. If you provide a huge platform, you should have a huge number of people looking after it. Like any publisher, they should be legally responsible for what they publish.ANTHONY J. WALTERS, CHICAGOTo the Editor:Getting the toothpaste back into the tube will not be easy. It\u2019s been clear for some time now that social media is an instrument of chaos. It is the equivalent of millions of people standing on soapboxes on the street and shouting things at you. Many of the things are false, some are abusive and a lot of people hide behind curtains so you can\u2019t know their true identities.As more and more Americans believe what they see on social media, they will not agree on what is real and what is fake.Democracy requires an informed and involved citizenry, and if the people in the country cannot even agree on what is actually happening, then how can our democracy survive?It may be too late, but at the very least Facebook and the others must limit their news feeds to only what comes from legitimate, acknowledged professional journalism sources.There will still be a lot of \u201calternate facts,\u201d conspiracy theories and plain lies bandied about by both innocent and willful postings, and the sites certainly should provide fact-checks about any of these that gain currency. But to wean people, especially young people, away from social media and back to legitimate news sources may be an impossible task.MICHAEL SPIELMAN, BRONXTo the Editor:While reports of entities associated with the Russian government posting propagandistic material on social media outlets are undoubtedly true, those reports are neither surprising nor significant. It is no secret that outlets such as Facebook and Twitter are online gossip boards rather than journalistic or scholarly venues.What is surprising is that people would base important decisions on social media postings since verification of their accuracy is virtually impossible. Doing so is intellectually lazy at best.PAUL ROMERO, OAKLAND, CALIF.Advertisement"}

As recent congressional hearings showed, the arteries of our democracy were clogged with toxins from a hostile foreign power.But the problem is not the Russians \u2014 it\u2019s us. We\u2019re getting played because too many Americans are ill equipped to perform the basic functions of citizenship. If the point of the Russian campaign, aided domestically by right-wing media, was to get people to think there is no such thing as knowable truth, the bad guys have won.We have a White House of lies because a huge percentage of the population can\u2019t tell fact from fiction. But a huge percentage is also clueless about the basic laws of the land. In a democracy, we the people are supposed to understand our role in this power-sharing thing.Fake news is a real thing produced by active disseminators of falsehoods. Trump uses the term to describe anything he doesn\u2019t like, a habit now picked up by political liars everywhere.But Trump is a symptom; the breakdown in this democracy goes beyond the liar in chief. For that you have to blame all of us: we have allowed the educational system to become negligent in teaching the owner\u2019s manual of citizenship.Lost in the news grind over Roy Moore, the lawbreaking Senate candidate from Alabama, is how often he has tried to violate the Constitution. As a judge, he was removed from the bench \u2014 twice \u2014 for lawless acts that follow his theocratic view of governance.Shariah law has been justifiably criticized as a dangerous injection of religion into the public space. Now imagine if a judge insisted on keeping a monument to the Quran in a state judicial building. Or that he said \u201chomosexual conduct\u201d should be illegal because his sacred book tells him so. That is exactly what Moore has done, though he substitutes the Bible for the Quran.I don\u2019t blame Moore. I blame his followers, and the press, which doesn\u2019t seem to know that the First Amendment specifically aims to keep government from siding with one religion \u2014 the so-called establishment clause.Yet one in three Americans fail the immigrant citizenship test. This is not an elitist barrier. The test includes questions like, \u201cWhat major event happened on 9/11?\u201d and \u201cWhat ocean is on the West Coast of the United States?\u201dOne reason that public schools were established across the land was to produce an informed citizenry. And up until the 1960s, it was common for students to take three separate courses in civics and government before they got out of high school.Now only a handful of states require proficiency in civics as a condition of high school graduation. Students are hungry, in this turbulent era, for discussion of politics and government. But the educators are failing them. Civics has fallen to the side, in part because of the standardized test mania.But those initiatives will mean little if people still insist on believing what they want to believe, living in digital safe spaces closed off from anything that intrudes on their worldview.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Building A.I. That Can Build A.I.", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "Google and others, fighting for a small pool of researchers, are looking for automated ways to deal with a shortage of artificial intelligence experts.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 They are a dream of researchers but perhaps a nightmare for highly skilled computer programmers: artificially intelligent machines that can build other artificially intelligent machines.With it, Google may soon find a way to create A.I. technology that can partly take the humans out of building the A.I. systems that many believe are the future of the technology industry.The project is part of a much larger effort to bring the latest and greatest A.I. techniques to a wider collection of companies and software developers.The world\u2019s largest tech businesses, including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, sometimes pay millions of dollars a year to A.I. experts, effectively cornering the market for this hard-to-find talent. The shortage isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, just because mastering these skills takes years of work.This is not altruism. Researchers like Mr. Dean believe that if more people and companies are working on artificial intelligence, it will propel their own research. At the same time, companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft see serious money in the trend that Mr. Sirosh described. All of them are selling cloud-computing services that can help other businesses and developers build A.I.\u201cThere is real demand for this,\u201d said Matt Scott, a co-founder and the chief technical officer of Malong, a start-up in China that offers similar services. \u201cAnd the tools are not yet satisfying all the demand.\u201dEventually, the Google project will help companies build systems with artificial intelligence even if they don\u2019t have extensive expertise, Mr. Dean said. Today, he estimated, no more than a few thousand companies have the right talent for building A.I., but many more have the necessary data.\u201cWe want to go from thousands of organizations solving machine learning problems to millions,\u201d he said.Google is investing heavily in cloud-computing services \u2014 services that help other businesses build and run software \u2014 which it expects to be one of its primary economic engines in the years to come. And after snapping up such a large portion of the world\u2019s top A.I researchers, it has a means of jump-starting this engine.By analyzing the sounds in a vast collection of old technical support calls, for instance, a machine-learning algorithm can learn to recognize spoken words.But building a neural network is not like building a website or some run-of-the-mill smartphone app. It requires significant math skills, extreme trial and error, and a fair amount of intuition. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagn\u00e9, the chief executive of an independent machine-learning lab called Element AI, refers to the process as \u201ca new kind of computer programming.\u201dIn building a neural network, researchers run dozens or even hundreds of experiments across a vast network of machines, testing how well an algorithm can learn a task like recognizing an image or translating from one language to another. Then they adjust particular parts of the algorithm over and over again, until they settle on something that works. Some call it a \u201cdark art,\u201d just because researchers find it difficult to explain why they make particular adjustments.But with AutoML, Google is trying to automate this process. It is building algorithms that analyze the development of other algorithms, learning which methods are successful and which are not. Eventually, they learn to build more effective machine learning. Google said AutoML could now build algorithms that, in some cases, identified objects in photos more accurately than services built solely by human experts.Barret Zoph, one of the Google researchers behind the project, believes that the same method will eventually work well for other tasks, like speech recognition or machine translation.Many believe such methods will significantly accelerate the progress of A.I. in both the online and physical worlds. At the University of California, Berkeley, researchers are building techniques that could allow robots to learn new tasks based on what they have learned in the past.\u201cComputers are going to invent the algorithms for us, essentially,\u201d said a Berkeley professor, Pieter Abbeel. \u201cAlgorithms invented by computers can solve many, many problems very quickly \u2014 at least that is the hope.\u201dThis is also a way of expanding the number of people and businesses that can build artificial intelligence. These methods will not replace A.I. researchers entirely. Experts, like those at Google, must still do much of the important design work. But the belief is that the work of a few experts can help many others build their own software.Renato Negrinho, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who is exploring technology similar to AutoML, said this was not a reality today but should be in the years to come. \u201cIt is just a matter of when,\u201d he said.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a researcher for Google. He is Sergey Levine, not Levin. The caption also included an outdated credential for him. He is an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, not a post-doctoral researcher there.Advertisement"}

A so-called Series B investment in 2011 judged Uber to be worth $300 million before an injection of $37 million of new cash, according to Crunchbase. A hypothetical seller would be exiting today at about 142 times the implied \u201cpost-money\u201d valuation. Spread over about six years, that implies an incredible internal rate of return \u2014 a common measure of profitability \u2014 of about 130 percent.That means a range of investors across Silicon Valley, Wall Street and beyond are in position to capture a career-defining return. They can take money off the table and stop worrying about Uber\u2019s seemingly inexhaustible capacity for scandal.Yet Uber could be turning a corner. It recently hired a promising new boss in Dara Khosrowshahi, a former Expedia chief. Sloppy governance is being cleaned up, even more so if the new offer secures enough sellers. And having SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son on its side would be valuable, with his deep pockets and ride-hailing holdings across the globe.These are heady times for tech, however. There is a risk that Uber becomes a globally significant, and yet not very lucrative, service like Snap or Twitter, both of which have market valuations of about $16 billion. There is also the tantalizing possibility that Uber turns into a self-driving, logistics colossus that could rival Facebook or Tencent in terms of value.If there was, say, a binary option of Uber\u2019s having a one-in-four shot at becoming a $500 billion company or instead a $15 billion also-ran, it would imply a blended valuation of $136 billion.

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Opens Door to More Consolidation in TV Business", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to allow a single company to own a newspaper and television and radio stations in the same town, reversing a decades-old rule aimed at preventing any individual or company from having too much power over local coverage.The vote was the latest action in a deregulatory blitz at the agency cheered on by media, broadband and cable corporations, but opposed by many Democrats and consumer advocates, who say Americans will be hurt from greater consolidation in those industries.Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump, has said the media ownership rules \u2014 including the cross-ownership ban between newspapers and television and radio stations \u2014 was outdated. He said most Americans get their news from a variety of sources and, most prominent among them, online platforms like Facebook and Google.Local media organizations, he has argued, would have a greater shot at competing against those internet giants by combining resources in local markets.\u201cIt\u2019s a simple proposition: The media ownership regulations of 2017 should match the media marketplace of 2017,\u201d Mr. Pai said on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s the proposition the F.C.C. vindicates today \u2014 nothing more, nothing less. And it\u2019s about time.\u201dDemocrats on the commission said that rolling back the rules would hurt people who relied on local stations for news coverage.\u201cDuring the first 10 months of 2017, the F.C.C. majority has given the green light to more than a dozen actions that are a direct attack on consumers and small businesses,\u201d said Mignon Clyburn, a Democratic commissioner, who voted against the orders. \u201cAnd most Americans are unaware that the agency established to protect the public interest has traded in that role for the chance to grant the wish lists of billion-dollar companies.\u201dPublic interest groups fear major corporations like Sinclair or CBS would grow more powerful through the relaxation of rules. Private equity investors who have purchased television stations and newspapers to flip them for a profit are also expected to take advantage of the changes.\u201cOur media ownership numbers are already dismally low,\u201d said Carmen Scurato, the director for the National Hispanic Media Coalition, a nonprofit that promotes greater diversity in media. \u201cThese actions on Thursday shut out our voices.\u201dSome academics are skeptical that the relaxation in rules will result in more robust local news coverage, as Mr. Pai envisions.There is little evidence that mergers in local media have resulted in more jobs and stronger journalism, said Victor Pickard, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. Instead, the relaxation of rules could result in business models like that of Sinclair, which sends programming created from its station in Washington to be run at stations across the nation, critics of the changes have said.\u201cMedia concentration has been a concern since the 1940s, and this is a major reversal,\u201d Mr. Pickard said. He added that internet platforms did not create news content on their own so were not real competition to broadcast journalism.\u201cThe fact that media content is coming from many sources, including the internet, isn\u2019t evidence of real competition because that isn\u2019t where actual journalism is coming from,\u201d Mr. Pickard said.Mr. Pai has rebutted the claims of coordination with Sinclair.It is unclear who would first take advantage of the new rules. But a company like Sinclair could benefit from the elimination of a rule that prevents one entity from owning two top stations in a local market. Through its Tribune deal, Sinclair would have about 10 markets with more than one of the four top stations. And with the new rules, it may not have to divest those stations, some analysts say.The National Association of Broadcasters, the lobbying group for television and radio broadcast station and network owners, said the rules would also help small, independent television owners, who have gone in to lobby Mr. Pai to support the changes.\u201cThe F.C.C.\u2019s past decisions retaining the local ownership rules depended upon the agency closing its eyes and covering its ears to avoid recognizing what is clear to any consumer with a TV remote or a smartphone \u2014 that local broadcast stations and newspapers do not exist in a vacuum and that broadcasters and newspaper owners must compete with myriad other outlets for viewers, listeners, readers and advertisers,\u201d the group said in a blog post.Advertisement"}

I was stunned. Our largest single source of traffic, accounting for more than half of our monthly page views, had been crippled.Surely, I thought, it was a glitch. It wasn\u2019t.Facebook had made a small but devastating change. Posts made by \u201cpages\u201d \u2014 including those of organizations like mine \u2014 had been removed from the regular News Feed, the default screen users see when they log on to the social media site. They were now segregated into a separate section called Explore Feed that users have to select before they can see our stories. (Unsurprisingly, this didn\u2019t apply to paid posts.)Some tech sites have reported that this feature might eventually be rolled out to Facebook users in the rest of the world, too. But of course no one really has any way of knowing what the social media company is up to. And we don\u2019t have any way to hold it accountable, either, aside from calling it out publicly. Maybe that\u2019s why it has chosen to experiment with this new feature in small countries far removed from the concerns of most Americans.But for us, changes like this can be disastrous. Attracting viewers to a story relies, above all, on making the process as simple as possible. Even one extra click can make a world of difference. This is an existential threat, not only to my organization and others like it but also to the ability of citizens in all of the countries subject to Facebook\u2019s experimentation to discover the truth about their societies and their leaders.Today, censorship in Serbia takes a softer form. Pliant outlets loyal to the government receive preferential treatment and better funding from local and central budgets. Those that stray out of line find themselves receiving unexpected visits from the tax inspectors.Going to KRIK\u2019s website is the only way Serbian citizens could learn the truth about that story and many others like it. And until last month, most of our readers went to our site via Facebook.Facebook allowed us to bypass mainstream channels and bring our stories to hundreds of thousands of readers. But now, even as the social network claims to be cracking down on \u201cfake news,\u201d it is on the verge of ruining us.That\u2019s why Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s arbitrary experiments are so dangerous. The major TV channels, mainstream newspapers and organized-crime-run outlets will have no trouble buying Facebook ads or finding other ways to reach their audiences. It\u2019s small, alternative organizations like mine that will suffer.We journalists bear some responsibility for this, too. Using Facebook to reach our readers has always been convenient, so we invested time and effort in building our presence there, helping it become the monster it is today.But what\u2019s done is done \u2014 a private company, accountable to no one, has taken over the world\u2019s media ecosystem. It is now responsible for what happens there. By picking small countries with shaky democratic institutions to be experimental subjects, it is showing a cynical lack of concern for how its decisions affect the most vulnerable.I\u2019ve always been attracted to alternative scenes. In the 1990s, I ran a small, independent punk magazine. Now, as an investigative editor and reporter, I want to get at the stories the big, timid outlets won\u2019t cover. In a country like Serbia, independent sites like mine, and the few others that survive, are the only places people can learn the truth.Facebook could be a tool for such alternative spaces to thrive. Instead \u2014 at least in Serbia \u2014 it risks becoming just another playground for the powerful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How 41 People in Lithuania Took Over Your Facebook Feed", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftOf all of Facebook\u2019s superpowers, perhaps the most disconcerting is how it can make online publishers disappear with the push of a button.But there is also a remarkable story about longevity in the Facebook publishing world. It comes, improbably, from Vilnius, Lithuania, where a small but mighty digital publisher is successfully navigating the changing tides of Facebook\u2019s algorithms. Its story illustrates the qualities needed to survive in today\u2019s Facebook-dominated digital media world: agility, lean operations, a clearly defined brand and a fair bit of luck.The company, Bored Panda, might not be familiar to you. But if you have a Facebook account and a pulse, you\u2019ve probably seen its handiwork. Maybe it was \u201c10+ Before-and-After Pics That Prove Men Look Better With Beards,\u201d or \u201c41 Times Uber Drivers Surprised Their Clients.\u201d Or perhaps you watched \u201cShh, Don\u2019t Wake Them,\u201d a 49-second video montage of dogs, cats and hamsters sleeping peacefully.The company has done all this without raising outside funding, unlike digital powerhouses such as BuzzFeed and Vice, which have collected hundreds of millions of dollars. It also has only 41 employees, and the low operating costs, along with its enormous popularity, have made for good business. Tomas Banisauskas, Bored Panda\u2019s founder, told me he expects to be profitable this year with $20 million to $30 million in revenue, mostly from the advertisements that appear on its website. Roughly 90 percent of its web traffic comes from Facebook, making the social network by far the biggest factor in Bored Panda\u2019s success.\u201cThey\u2019re a really helpful company for us,\u201d Mr. Banisauskas, 31, said of Facebook.On the content side, Bored Panda\u2019s strategy followed a familiar playbook. It collected user-generated content from Reddit, Instagram, Twitter and other social platforms and repackaged it with tempting headlines. But by focusing on art, photography and other creative pursuits, and by studiously sticking to the kind of apolitical content that few people object to, Bored Panda has steadily built a feel-good, escapist empire.Bored Panda has the advantage of getting most of its content free from up-and-coming artists and other creative types who want the kind of exposure a large Facebook page can bring. (And, yes, it does ask for permission. I contacted several artists whose work had been featured on Bored Panda, and all said they\u2019d given their blessing.) It has also adopted a quality-over-quantity strategy that appears to have served it well. It published only 519 articles in October, or roughly 16 posts a day, according to NewsWhip. Compare that with CNN, which published 5,595 articles during the month, and Fox News, which published 51,919 articles.It hasn\u2019t been a straight line to success. In its early days, Bored Panda relied on StumbleUpon, a link aggregation site that was popular at the time, for much of its traffic. But in 2010, according to Mr. Banisauskas, StumbleUpon sharply reduced Bored Panda\u2019s prominence on the site and pressured him to buy ads instead.The next several years were a struggle, but in 2013, Bored Panda began to see a spike in viewers being sent from a new source: Facebook. Its positive, lighthearted content was a hit with the social network\u2019s users, and the site\u2019s traffic grew tenfold in a single year. Soon, despite Mr. Banisauskas\u2019s intentions, Bored Panda was far from self-sufficient \u2014 its prospects hinged almost entirely on Facebook.More recently, while its competitors have hedged their risks by diversifying away from Facebook, Bored Panda has made a conscious effort to pull the platform even closer. It has started several offshoot Facebook brands, including pages for art and animal-themed stories, and a page called Crafty Panda that focuses on D.I.Y. projects. It has begun creating original content, too, and recently set up a video studio in its office, a hospital from the 19th century that was converted into a tech office complex.\u201cEveryone wants to be not so dependent on Facebook,\u201d Mr. Banisauskas told me. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s impossible \u2014 Facebook is the place where people share their ideas.\u201dBut dependence comes with real risk. Last month, for example, Facebook began testing a new design for its news feed. In this version, which is being tested in six countries, Facebook posts from pages (including businesses, public figures and publishers like Bored Panda) were removed from the regular news feed. They were placed in a separate section called \u201cExplore Feed,\u201d where they appeared less prominently.Rafat Ali, a digital publishing veteran and chief executive of the travel media company Skift, said that while these particular algorithmic changes might not come to pass, sites like Bored Panda could still be easily crushed by a future Facebook experiment.\u201cYou never know when the rug could be pulled from under them,\u201d Mr. Ali said. \u201cThey could be done in a year or two.\u201dMr. Banisauskas knows that Facebook can be a fickle landlord, and he worries that as a small foreign company that specializes in aggregated entertainment content, Bored Panda is in a more precarious position than most. Roughly half of Bored Panda\u2019s Facebook audience is American, and Mr. Banisauskas worries that the site could be punished inadvertently by efforts to combat fake news and Russian-style influence campaigns.\u201cWe\u2019re not part of the problem,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we could get the collateral damage.\u201dLast summer, Mr. Banisauskas traveled to New York to meet with a group of other Facebook-focused publishers. All these companies produce entertaining material that reaches millions of people every day. In another era, that alone might have been enough to guarantee them a stable future. Today, they exist at Facebook\u2019s mercy and might be wiped away at any moment.For now, though, Bored Panda is charging ahead, and hoping to remain on Facebook\u2019s good side.\u201cEveryone should be worried,\u201d Mr. Banisauskas said, before he injected a note of Bored Panda-style positivity: \u201cBut I believe everything will work out well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Wanted a Bigger Tax Cut for the Rich, Ivanka Went Elsewhere", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump urged senators this month to repeal the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that most Americans have health insurance and use the proceeds to slash the top tax rate paid by the richest Americans, a suggestion that pitted his priorities against his daughter and Republican senators intent on helping the middle class.In the end, the president accepted only a partial victory. He got the repeal of the health law\u2019s individual mandate, but gave up on an income tax rate cut that would have directly benefited him personally. Instead, Ivanka Trump and her allies in the Senate prevailed in their push to include an expanded child tax credit.\u201cThis was certainly an uphill battle, especially given that it is not an issue that is as widely understood,\u201d said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah and a leading advocate of the expanded child tax credit. \u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily have the sense that the president was opposed to it. I still don\u2019t have that sense. I think if he had been, things would have worked out differently than they did.\u201dTwo White House officials pushed back against the notion that Ms. Trump had split with her father. They said middle-income tax relief was one of the president\u2019s priorities and that Ms. Trump worked in lock step with the administration on all aspects of tax reform.But the fight is actually continuing. Later this week, Mr. Lee and Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, will take on another top priority of the president\u2019s, cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. The senators plan to offer an amendment that would cut the corporate tax rate to 22 percent, instead of 20 percent, and use the proceeds to help families with little or no income tax liabilities benefit from the expanded child credit and to allow the child credit to rise with inflation.A White House spokesman, Raj Shah, wasted no time declaring the president\u2019s opposition on Wednesday.Mr. Trump was not secretive about his desire for a lower income tax rate for the nation\u2019s wealthiest families. This month, he tweeted his desire:But his suggestion that the top rate come down clashed directly with the push to assist the middle class. The president had also pressed to eliminate the estate tax, a provision that would have hugely benefited his heirs.Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee did vote unanimously to add the repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate to their bill, effectively giving themselves more than $300 billion to spend on additional tax cuts. Then lawmakers went to work to devote that money to priorities other than lowering the top income tax rate or cutting the estate tax.Senators Lee and Rubio enlisted Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who talks frequently with Ms. Trump, and Senator Dean Heller of Nevada to push the child credit expansion in the Finance Committee.\u201cIt seemed to me to be common sense if our goal was to deliver as much of a tax break for the middle class on down,\u201d Mr. Scott said.The victory somewhat improved the optics of a bill that most opinion polls suggest is unpopular among a majority of the American public. By expanding the credit to $2,000 per child from $1,650, as initially proposed in the Senate bill, Republicans substantially reduced the number of middle-class families who are likely to face an immediate tax increase under the bill.The higher child tax credit in the Senate tax plan avoids tax increases for 3.5 million families, compared to the less generous credit increase in the House plan. (Because that credit and all other individual tax breaks in the bill are scheduled to expire in 2025 to satisfy Senate procedural rules, all middle-class families face a looming tax hike in 2026 if a future Congress does not intervene.)Senate Republicans worried about those distributional effects, Mr. Scott said. By expanding the credit and also allowing taxpayers of higher incomes to claim it, he added, \u201cThat combination solved the problem for a lot of people.\u201dDemocrats have criticized the decision to include mandate repeal in the tax bill. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it will lead to 13 million fewer Americans choosing to buy health insurance or sign up for government-provided insurance such as Medicaid, and its analysis finds the move will, on balance, reduce incomes for workers earning $30,000 and below, because they will receive fewer government benefits and subsidies for care.Republicans say mandate repeal, which is politically popular, gives consumers the freedom to choose whether they buy coverage without fear of government penalty. They say the budget office is wrong to score benefits that consumers willingly forgo as lost income.But they are happy to accept the analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation that the move will free up more than $300 billion \u2014 through reduced government spending \u2014 that can be used to offset tax reductions in the bill.That money gave an opening to Mr. Lee, Mr. Rubio and Ms. Trump, who had worked together for months laying the groundwork for the child credit expansion. The group was disappointed in the House version of the tax bill and the initial Senate bill, which expanded the credit from $1,000 today, but counteracted that expansion with other lost tax breaks for families.\u201cThe nominal expansion in the original bill was quite arguably completely eaten up by other changes,\u201d Mr. Lee said.Neither Mr. Scott nor Mr. Lee would characterize their conversations with the president during that negotiating period, but Mr. Lee said there were several competing ideas for how to allocate the $300 billion.Had Mr. Trump\u2019s request for a 35 percent top rate been granted in full, Republicans would have delivered even larger benefits to high earners, whom the joint committee judges already to be the largest recipients of tax cuts under the plan. Mr. Trump would have likely seen his tax bill shrink considerably.White House officials say the president was pleased simply to see the mandate repeal included. And while Mr. Lee is still pushing for a further expansion of the child credit \u2014 one that would allow more low-income families with little or no income tax liabilities to benefit from it \u2014 he called the overall bill \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201dHe, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Scott and Mr. Heller are all expected to vote for it on the Senate floor.Advertisement"}

Over the last year, Fiona has become something of an international cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, largely because of the efforts of Ms. Curley, the zoo\u2019s communications director, and her four-person team, who started posting Fiona\u2019s every move to social media from the day she was born on Jan. 24 (prematurely, and perilously, but more on that later).Being at the center of a 24/7 hype machine for a 500-pound (and growing) starlet can be exhausting, and Ms. Curley got her tattoo as a way to commemorate the intensity of the past year. \u201cI didn\u2019t think any experience would ever top this experience,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m never going to regret getting it.\u201d\u201cWe think this is just Michelle\u2019s way of one-upping her groupie status,\u201d said Chad Yelton, the zoo\u2019s vice president of marketing. \u201cShe has all the merch, the tumblers, the calendar. If there\u2019s something with Fiona\u2019s face on it, she has to have it first.\u201dWhen Fiona was born, no one expected her to survive. Bibi, her lumbering, obstinate mother (\u201cFiona gets all of her diva tendencies from her mom,\u201d said Christina Gorsuch, the curator for African mammals) gave birth six weeks early, and the baby weighed only 29 pounds. Most viable hippos weigh between 55 and 120 pounds at birth; premature infants rarely pull through. \u201cIn the first six weeks, there was at least once a week when we were sure she was going to die,\u201d said Ms. Gorsuch, who was wearing a pair of hippo-shaped stud earrings in her office next to the antelope pen. \u201cI kept telling the keepers to call me in the middle of the night when the inevitable happens.\u201dShe was kept in the bestial equivalent of a newborn I.C.U., with round-the-clock care that included visits from local nurses from Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital who located her tiny veins for an IV during a nasty bout of dehydration. Scientists at the zoo milked a hippo for the first time \u2014 \u201cwe had no idea what was in hippo milk before now,\u201d Ms. Gorsuch said \u2014 so that they could recreate the formula for Fiona\u2019s bottles. Every day, between January and May 15, when Fiona finally was able to promenade around the hippo tank for the public, seemed to bring a new health crisis. All of this was documented on social media for the world to see.\u201cFiona is one of a kind, there\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d said Thane Maynard, the director of the zoo, who talked to me in the zoo\u2019s giant boardroom, featuring a lacquered mahogany table and several figurines of rare African mammals. The room would not have felt out of place in Disney\u2019s Adventureland. Mr. Maynard was wearing a safari shirt and khaki pants, held up by a belt featuring a giant silver buckle of an elephant\u2019s head. \u201cAround here I\u2019m known as the King of Khaki,\u201d he said.He knew Fiona was an international phenomenon after going on his yearly exotic birding expedition to the Black Rock Lodge in rural northern Belize. Fiona was only 6 weeks old at the time. Mr. Maynard overheard two strangers from California talking at the lodge about how grateful they were to have Wi-Fi in the jungle so they could get their \u201cFiona fix\u201d on Facebook. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew, boy, she really is a rock star,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Fiona\u2019s world and we are just living in it.\u201dMr. Maynard says that other zoo directors have begun to approach him about how he turned Fiona into the sensation she has become. The publicity team\u2019s decision to share updates on the hippo from the beginning was unconventional; most zoos wait to share information on troubled animals. \u201cNow we are getting asked at conferences about how we did it,\u201d Mr. Yelton said. \u201cWe tell people, you have to find your Fiona, whatever that may be, and just tell the story.\u201dMs. Curley said, \u201cWe have tried to say we are going to stop posting about her every day, but we get 100,000 commenters telling us they must have updates. Everyone is so invested now.\u201d\u201cPeople tell us all the time that Fiona is something everyone can agree on,\u201d said Amy LaBarbara, the zoo\u2019s coordinator for marketing and events. \u201cWe have heard from countless people online that Fiona has been uniting the United States. We hear from people going through chemo that tell us she is the only bright spot in their day.\u201dAngela Hatke, the zoo\u2019s communications coordinator, said: \u201cEvery time we post a photo of her weight, we get messages about body positivity. We aren\u2019t saying these things. These are the fans coming up with it on their own.\u201dThe fervor around Fiona makes sense, given the polarized, tense, mass anxiety swirling around the country this year. When times get rough, we tend to project our hopes and fears onto animals. It happened during the global economic meltdown, when the baby polar bear Knut became the undeniable star of the Berlin Zoo, raised by hand by his trainer after his mother, Tosca, rejected him in 2006. (Knut\u2019s entire short life was blanketed by controversy \u2014 are polar bears meant to be raised by humans? \u2014 and ended in tragedy, as he slipped into the water and drowned in front of horrified zoogoers in 2011.)In other words, it can be dangerous to overhype and anthropomorphize wild animals, as we project our fantasies and desires onto them and turn the narrative into a heartwarming tale that serves to reaffirm our own sense of goodness. The animal becomes a meme, a product, a unit of sale. As the late critic John Berger wrote of celebrity creatures living in zoos: \u201cThis reduction of the animal, which has a theoretical as well as economic history, is part of the same process as that by which men have been reduced to isolated productive and consuming units.\u201dAnd yet, many of Fiona\u2019s keepers insist that she courts and adores the attention. \u201cShe absolutely knows she is a star,\u201d Ms. Gorsuch said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this industry over 20 years and I\u2019ve never seen or experienced or heard anything like this. She loves the camera. She has the biggest personality. And yet she is clearly a hippo. When we reintroduced her to her parents, she knew how to be a hippo immediately. She has an incredible ability to balance her little worlds; being an animal, and being in public.\u201dThe day I visited Fiona, Cincinnati was chilly and overcast and only a few fans were lingering around Hippo Cove, the $7.5 million enclosure that opened in 2016 and offers visitors the rare opportunity to view hippos as they frolic underwater. Fiona was out and spinning, like \u201cFantasia\u201d brought to life. But where the vintage Disney version of hippos in tutus now feels more like a cruel, shaming joke, the experience of watching Fiona pirouetting felt joyful and buoyant. A roly-poly imp, she swam underneath the 3,300-pound body of Bibi, her mother. Fiona\u2019s father, Henry, was inside, having suffered for months with infection and weight loss, an old man in hippo years at 36.Two weeks later, on Halloween, the zoo announced his death. \u201cHe was also smitten with Bibi, the zoo\u2019s 18-year-old female, and followed her everywhere,\u201d the zoo wrote in a statement. Fiona \u201cwas the sixth calf that Henry sired over the years and, because she survived against all odds, has become a celebrity and an ambassador for the species. He couldn\u2019t have left a better legacy.\u201dFiona\u2019s celebrity has undeniably been good for human business. A local brewery, Listermann, began making a #TeamFiona New England I.P.A. in June, and the first edition of the beer sold out within a day. (At least 10 people camped out in front of the brewery, which is a local hangout for zoo employees, to get a case.) Jared Lewinski, a brewer there, told me that they are now on their fifth edition, and plan to make a special commemorative ale for Fiona\u2019s first birthday in January. After pledging to donate 25 percent of all beer sales to Fiona\u2019s treatment, the brewery has now raised over $30,000.Darin Overholser and Josh Sneed, the founders of the upstart Cincy Shirts, have hit it big with their Fiona merchandise, which they made with the blessing of the P.R. team at the zoo. \u201cAt first, we thought of doing it as a \u2018Jaws\u2019 parody,\u201d Mr. Overholser said. \u201cThat was a terrible idea. When we came up with \u2018Feeling Hip,\u2019 it just clicked, and our T-shirts were on the NBC Nightly News. We just have one guy making them in a basement, and the demand has been insane.\u201dMr. Overholser told me that he is thinking of expanding the Fiona gear into a full-fledged, national brand. \u201cWe made polo shirts with a hippo embroidered on them, like Lacoste,\u201d he said.Mr. Yelton, who fields all requests for Fiona collaborations, told me that he has had to turn down hundreds of offers for hippo-branded ideas. \u201cPeople ask us if Fiona can show up at their home and garden show,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018No, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019 Facebook came to us about the show, which was a perfect fit. I\u2019m surprised Hollywood hasn\u2019t come to us about a film. I feel like an agent with a very famous client. I feel like I represent Beyonc\u00e9. When she comes around the corner in her pool, crowds lose their minds. Every single time. People cry. People fly across the world to just catch a glimpse.\u201d\u201cWhen people hear we\u2019ve held her, they want to touch our hands,\u201d Ms. Curley said.Ms. Gorsuch also said that she herself has become notorious in local circles as the \u201ccoach of #TeamFiona\u201d thanks to the Facebook videos. \u201cPeople get crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been hugged by many strangers.\u201dAlmost everyone I spoke with in Cincinnati seemed to have an opinion on the blessed child. Keith Gavigan, the proprietor of the Symphony Hotel, an inn in town, runs overnight zoo tours on the side and treasures his glimpses of Fiona at dawn. \u201cShe\u2019s a ham for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cMy tip is to go in the rain, because she will still be out, and you can beat the crowds.\u201dAs the zoo prepares for the long winter \u2014 Fiona cannot go outside when it is under 50 degrees \u2014 Ms. Curley said that they are planning to continue live-streaming the hippo\u2019s life as long as the public has an appetite.Elena Passarello, the author of this year\u2019s \u201cAnimals Strike Curious Poses,\u201d an essay collection about the history of famous beasts, said that celebrity animals will always reflect the times they are in. \u201cLike Humphrey the Humpback and Springer the Orca and Mike the Headless Chicken, every critter I\u2019ve come up with who \u2018made the news\u2019 was written about in some way that allows their story to coincide with a particular, of-the-moment human concern,\u201d she said. \u201cEven Pizza Rat!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an easy leap to a more overt connection between a particular story \u2014 a wayward whale, a preemie hippo, a lost baby, a miracle rooster \u2014 and whatever struggle, triumph or challenge that the group of humans who see the animal are collectively experiencing,\u201d Ms. Passarello said. \u201cIn terms of Fiona, I think something similar is happening in regards to her life and the \u2018over-love\u2019 she\u2019s garnering. It\u2019s as difficult to love and understand a human as it is to process their loss. A human baby comes with it so many opportunities for peril, for evil, for disappointment and failure. A human birth points to a future we elder humans know we probably will not understand and might be pushed out of. But a baby animal \u2014 especially one that we\u2019ve put in a cage of human experience, as we\u2019ve done for Fiona, holds more limited possibility. Fiona\u2019s youth is in this precious box, and we can love it unconditionally because there are so few possibilities to it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the weight of Bibi, Fiona\u2019s mother. She weighs about 3,300 pounds, not 8,000 pounds. The article also referred imprecisely to the care Fiona received at the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital. She was cared for by nurses, not doctors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Two Contrasting Views of Silicon Valley\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryThe pervasive influence of Silicon Valley on our economy, culture and politics is a subject worthy of close study. Two important new books released this week offer startlingly different approaches and conclusions on these complex issues. The contrasting epigraphs that begin the works perfectly reflect their respective perspectives.To be fair, the conflict in visions is less stark than it seems because the two authors are focused on different time periods. \u201cTroublemakers\u201d covers \u201cthe generational handoff\u201d that happened between the late 1960s and the early \u201980s \u201cas pioneers of the semiconductor industry passed the baton to younger up-and-comers.\u201d Mr. Cohen\u2019s ire primarily targets those \u201cwho helped nurture the World Wide Web to prosperity in the 1990s before turning to investing.\u201dOne does not have to be sympathetic to a more benign view of the technology industry to appreciate Ms. Berlin\u2019s deeply researched and dramatic narrative of Silicon Valley\u2019s early years in \u201cTroublemakers.\u201d To tell this story, she selects seven lesser-known but influential figures to follow closely throughout that period. These include the first woman to take a technology company public, the first chairman of Apple, and a man who played critical roles in government to create the internet and in industry to commercialize it through the personal computer. Their names will most likely be unfamiliar, but their meticulously told stories permit the reader to gain a nuanced understanding of the emergence of the broader technology ecosystem that has enabled Silicon Valley to thrive.Nuance is not a word that comes to mind in reading Mr. Cohen\u2019s attack on Silicon Valley\u2019s powers that be. The first two chapters are devoted to key figures in the history of Stanford\u2019s administration and computer science department, emphasizing both the university\u2019s willingness to trade off academic rigor for financial gain and its institutional sympathy for eugenics in the early 1900s and, more recently, extreme libertarianism. These underlying themes, in Mr. Cohen\u2019s view, underpin \u201cthe Stanford model of integrating the hacker and the entrepreneur.\u201d This model is reflected in staking William Hewlett and David Packard in the 1930s, establishing the Stanford Industrial Park in the 1950s and obtaining a $336 million payout from Google stock in return for granting the exclusive PageRank license.It is this unholy alliance between hacker and entrepreneur values that Mr. Cohen rails against for the balance of the book. Although he pauses for a handful of pages to speak about Microsoft \u2014 \u201cIf the Know-It-Alls\u2019 values represent a merger of a hacker\u2019s radical individualism and an entrepreneur\u2019s greed, then only one man can be considered their forefather: Bill Gates\u201d \u2014 he believes that the negative ramifications \u201conly fully flourished with the widespread adoption of the World Wide Web starting in the late 1990s.\u201d And so beginning with Marc Andreessen, who developed the first commercialized web browser, Netscape Navigator, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d proceeds to attack the character of just about every boldfaced name among tech billionaires. All are found guilty of either always promoting the insidious tech dogma that places no constraints on their ability to disrupt the status quo for their own financial gain or \u2014 as in the case of the once idealistic founders of Google and Facebook \u2014 having along the way been \u201cseduced by the power and money offered by venture capitalists.\u201dThe history that underpins that overarching thesis feels both selective and less than rigorous. Niels Reimers, the founder of Stanford\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing and one of the seven key industry figures profiled in detail in \u201cTroublemakers,\u201d is not even mentioned in \u201cThe-Know-It-Alls.\u201d Given the complex negotiations required to secure university approval, this seems like a significant oversight for a book whose thesis hinges in part on Stanford\u2019s supposed unthinking commercialism. And statements like computer science was \u201cstill something of an obscure discipline in the late 1980s\u201d just don\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. By 1990, there were almost 800 computer science degree programs offered at colleges and universities, enrolling tens of thousands of students.Although Mr. Cohen has identified legitimately disturbing aspects of the tech culture, he becomes repetitive, and his tone is unnecessarily conspiratorial. He also ignores when the facts contradict his assertions. Mr. Cohen complains about the \u201cPayPal mafia,\u201d former employees who \u201cprovided each other with cash, counsel and contacts.\u201d Mr. Cohen finds \u201csomething jarring about a group of self-styled survival of the fittest free marketeers committing to a strategy of collective risk and mutual support.\u201dWhen the Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is profiled as a contrast to the libertarian fanaticism and raw commercialism of the Know-It-Alls, his inability to raise funding is used to reinforce this point: \u201cWales and his partners had no rich friends to lean on in tough times.\u201d The narrative makes clear, however, that his problem was a flawed business model, not his lack of access to the PayPal mafia or other venture investors. Similarly, Mr. Cohen does not directly confront the irony that the story of Wikipedia\u2019s ultimate success was made possible only by its free-riding on Google\u2019s powerful \u2014 but in his view morally suspect \u2014 search engine.The tech industry has earned a takedown book that documents its self-interested justifications for any number of policies that are clearly not in the public interest. Its track record on matters including cybersecurity, gender equality and privacy is shameful. The brief profiles of \u201cThe Know-It Alls,\u201d sprinkled with gratuitous ad hominem observations (for example, Mr. Cohen writes that PayPal is responsible for \u201creleasing into the wild a self-satisfied Peter Thiel, a one-man wrecking crew who has been sowing chaos through American society up to this very day\u201d), do not get the job done.Given the profound impact on our lives of the technology industry and the apparent flaws in its current culture, both books leave the reader wondering where to go from here. \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d suggests that \u201cEurope provides a model\u201d relying on extensive regulation but, given the absence of any European tech giants of note, this seems like throwing the baby out with the bath water. Although the compelling history in \u201cTroublemakers\u201d provides a number of tantalizing clues as to where things got off track, this is not the focus of the book. Ms. Berlin does not whitewash the aspects of even the valley\u2019s early years that foreshadow the more profound cultural issues to emerge in the industry\u2019s middle age, writing, \u201cIt takes a certain kind of audacity to think you can launch a company, much less invent an industry \u2014 and audacity often veers into arrogance.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t go out of her way to explore their implications, either.When the founding of Fairchild Semiconductor is discussed, William Shockley is mentioned in passing, but Ms. Berlin notes that he \u201chad not yet fully descended into the paranoia and eugenic fervor that would later mar his reputation.\u201d In fact, his paranoia and abusiveness at least were already well known and, given that these qualities have been recurring contemporary industry themes, would have been worth examining.Similarly, when it\u2019s noted that a key to the venture capitalist Don Valentine\u2019s success was his willingness to overlook \u201cdeviant\u201d behavior, some discussion of the downside of letting the hacker culture run wild might have made sense.Silicon Valley\u2019s history is still being written. Both of these books are important reminders that whether or not it is ultimately a story with a happy ending will be a function of our collective willingness to closely examine the sector\u2019s origins to better understand not only the sources of innovation but how the most destructive aspects of the culture were allowed to fester for so long.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "In Italy, a Neo-Fascist Party\u2019s Small Win Creates Big Unease", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOSTIA, Italy \u2014 When a candidate for a neo-fascist party, CasaPound, won a seat this month on the municipal council of the Roman suburb of Ostia, many Italians were startled.Last week, Italian journalists trekked to Ostia to solemnly protest at the scene of the assault. Around the corner, residents were still celebrating, shrugging off the party\u2019s claims to be the direct descendant of Benito Mussolini\u2019s Fascist Party.\u201cLook at what I\u2019ll show you,\u201d said one, Gianluca Antonucci, as he unzipped his jacket to reveal a black shirt featuring Mussolini\u2019s granite face. \u201cIl Duce.\u201dFor a while, this country seemed an outlier as nationalist and xenophobic forces made gains across Europe. But now some fear that Italy, the birthplace of fascism, is catching up with its neighbors.\u201cIn every state we want nationalist forces to win,\u201d said Luca Marsella, CasaPound\u2019s newly elected council member, who won 9 percent of the vote. \u201cIf this happens in other cities, we\u2019ll have a chance to go into Parliament to defend our nation.\u201dThat is a long, long way off. The party, named after the American poet Ezra Pound, who supported Mussolini, is still statistically irrelevant on the national level.But CasaPound is winning seats in a handful of towns, and some of its core beliefs \u2014 a fondness for Russia and sharp opposition to the European Union, globalization and immigration, which it believes sully the national identity and economy \u2014 are increasingly spreading throughout Italy.Anti-immigration sentiment has grown so popular that the once-secessionist Northern League has dropped the word \u201cNorthern\u2019\u201d from its name as it looks for inroads to the south.The anti-establishment Five Star Movement, while ideologically amorphous, has charismatic firebrand leaders who take the stage to the chanting of their nicknames and then rile up crowds with a message of resentment.All of this makes CasaPound\u2019s leaders hopeful that Italy is newly fertile ground for fascism.The Italian Constitution bans \u201cthe reorganization in any form of the dissolved Fascist Party.\u201d But CasaPound and other neo-fascist movements have skirted the law by calling themselves the descendants of Mussolini. They insist that they believe in democracy and not a fascist dictatorship.\u201cWe are a young and clean political force,\u201d said Simone Di Stefano, the party\u2019s vice president, as he stood under posters of Mussolini in its Roman headquarters.The building, which sits incongruously in the heart of an immigrant neighborhood in central Rome, has served as the party\u2019s home since its leader, Gianluca Iannone, a tattooed and extravagantly bearded member of a right-wing punk band, led followers to occupy the apartments.Of course, there was also Pound, who ranted against Jews on Italian radio and was imprisoned for treason during the war. (The daughter of the poet has tried to make the party change its name.)Members with black boots, tattooed necks and shorn hair guard floors decorated with pictures of Fascist-era marches and banners reading \u201cArm Your Soul.\u201dBut its members exhibit the same fondness for Roman salutes and mythic glory days. CasaPound\u2019s leaders shrug off Mussolini\u2019s racial laws and alliance with Hitler with a nobody\u2019s-perfect nonchalance. They instead prefer to focus on Fascism\u2019s role in Italian modernization and military might.\u201cThat spirit of the nation bloomed in this country during those years,\u201d Mr. Di Stefano said. \u201cAnd I would like to bring that feeling back today.\u201dThat is especially so in Ostia, a suburb of 230,000, home to joblessness, resentment toward immigrants, and an organized crime problem so insidious that the police disbanded the local government two years ago.The journalist who was head-butted was trying to interview a member of a powerful local clan called the Spadas, which had thrown its support behind CasaPound.\u201cI voted for CasaPound, and I\u2019m proud of it,\u201d said Marina Luglu, as she walked out of Bar Music, owned by the head-butter, Roberto Spada, whom she admiringly called \u201cMr. Roberto.\u201dVoters here rewarded the party for its engagement with their rundown housing projects. CasaPound provided a food bank to hundreds of families, sent handymen to fix elevators and lawyers to locals in need.Viviana Prudenzi, a 34-year-old house cleaner walking down a seaside street with her mother, said she voted for CasaPound because its members were \u201cthe only ones who are here helping \u2014 helping the Italians.\u201d\u201cThey call them fascists because they think of Italians and not the foreigners,\u201d she said.This summer, Mr. Marsella, the CasaPound candidate, led a beach patrol of party members in red vests. They forced unlicensed and immigrant vendors, some visibly terrified, off the beach.Leftist activists have accused them of beatings. For recreation, party members whip each other with belts in mosh pits.\u201cWe don\u2019t recognize violence as a political tool, but if we are attacked, we respond,\u201d said Mr. Marsella, a soft-spoken 32-year-old I.T. consultant. Asked whether he had prevailed in his clashes with leftist activists, he cracked a smile. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201dOver the summer, Mr. Marsella and other members of CasaPound clashed with the riot police in Rome as they protested a proposal to grant citizenship to the Italian-born children of immigrants.That history of violence did not bother a group of women gathered in front of one of the Spada family\u2019s gyms. They hailed the CasaPound activists as \u201cgoodfellas.\u201dWhen the Rev. Franco De Donno, a priest known for his works against the Mafia and on behalf of immigrants, walked by, they cursed him as \u201cdisgusting\u201d for taking a leave of absence from his sacramental duties to run for office.They nearly attacked a woman who urged them to acknowledge the drugs and violence that riddled their neighborhood. Five Carabinieri patrol cars came to her aid.Father De Donno, who also earned a seat in the municipal government, said one of his supporters had been beaten by members of CasaPound, including Mr. Marsella. (Mr. Marsella denied this.)\u201cI hope that entering in the institution, Luca Marsella limits his recourse to violent methods,\u201d the priest said.On Sunday, amid an increased police presence, residents will vote in a runoff to decide who will become council president.Giuliana Di Pillo, the leading candidate of the Five Star Movement, acknowledged that CasaPound had siphoned support from her and her center-right opponent.She admitted to some trepidation about serving with a fascist. \u201cCertainly, it worries me,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Are All the Nannies on Instagram?", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotedBut there is one thing Ms. Dekel, 36, filters out of her Instagram feed: photos of the part-time nanny who cares for her children.\u201cPosting your nanny is like posting your address or your kids\u2019 school,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too much information.\u201dNannies are often lauded as indispensable to keeping modern families afloat, but even as the rise of Instagram Stories \u2014 the 15-second blips that self-destruct after 24 hours \u2014 encourages peak parental overshare (793,000 followers of Eva Chen, Instagram\u2019s director of fashion partnerships, know she packed a whale-shaped sandwich for her daughter, Ren, this week), nannies are hardly ever included in the picture. Some appear only as floating hands, popping a blueberry into a toddler\u2019s mouth.This isn\u2019t just the case on Instagram: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt reportedly employ multiple nannies for their six children, but they\u2019re seldom seen in paparazzi shots. The same is true of Maria Borrallo, the full-time nanny to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.A nanny\u2019s immigration or income status can also be a deterrent. In the last nine years, Oliver Quillia, a producer and father of two in the Bronx, has posted exactly one photo on Instagram of his beloved nanny, Lynn, whose last name he withheld for similar reasons. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the \u2018under the table\u2019 pay we give her, I would probably post way more photos of her,\u201d Mr. Quillia, 47, said.But when oversharing parents omit nannies on Instagram or Facebook, it can indeed be intended to shape perception of their own characters. \u201cI think many of us on social media, probably subconsciously, want to perpetuate this idea that we\u2019re doing it all on our own,\u201d said Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, an associate professor of history at the New School and a mother of two.\u201cMy children respect and love her so much, and I do too,\u201d Ms. Petrzela, 39, recalled thinking. \u201cWhy am I making that invisible?\u201dMs. Petrzela, who is white, had also considered the racial context between her and Ms. Peter, who is Afro-Caribbean. Though Ms. Petrzela is confident their relationship is respectful, \u201cthe history of white families being ministered to by women of color is not a really beautiful history,\u201d Ms. Petrzela said. \u201cPart of me felt hyper-aware about even the impression that any of those dynamics are repeating themselves in our home.\u201dWhile Ms. Peter is not on Facebook, she said she appreciates being included. \u201cIt makes me feel part of the family,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not give birth to the kids, but I love them very much.\u201d Of other parents who don\u2019t want pictures with their nannies, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. I\u2019m going to tell you the truth: most parents feel that if the children are too close to the nanny, that they\u2019re losing something.\u201dLauren Stein, a media executive and mother of two boys in New York, says she praises her live-in nanny (whose name she\u2019d rather not share) \u201cin real life\u201d but worries that posting odes to her on Facebook would only make Ms. Stein look fancier-than-thou and fuel mockery from her relatives.\u201cA lot of them crack jokes, like, \u201cOh, Lauren, you\u2019re here without your help? Is that hard for you? Are you surviving?\u2019\u201d Ms. Stein, 35, said.That class discomfort goes both ways, according to Grace Savage, a former nanny in Los Angeles. \u201cI think that a deeply institutionalized notion of \u2018place\u2019 is to blame,\u201d Ms. Savage, 35, said. \u201cThe domestic doesn\u2019t feel welcome in the photo, and the employer feels no inclination to extend such welcome.\u201dAccording to Ms. Gold, lifting the veil of secrecy and posting more about nannies on Instagram and Facebook would be a new way to value them, while also getting real with other parents about what it takes for working moms and dads to juggle it all.\u201cIt\u2019s great to say, \u2018I have help,\u2019\u201d Ms. Gold said.\u201cShe\u2019s such a part of the fabric of this squad,\u201d Ms. Lavinthal, 38, said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even think about cropping her out.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the presence of celebrity nannies in paparazzi shots. The nannies of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, as well as the royal nanny Maria Borrallo, have been photographed by paparazzi, though they seldom appear in photographs with their employers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Companies Get High Marks for Covering Infertility Treatments", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserA relatively small number of companies offer generous benefits for infertility treatment to employees, while most have minimal or no coverage, a new report found.It\u2019s a case of \u201chaves and have-nots,\u201d said Jake Anderson, a founder of FertilityIQ, the start-up that wrote the report.It found that technology companies as well as employers in consulting and banking tended to offer generous coverage for costly assisted-reproduction techniques like in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F.FertilityIQ was founded by Mr. Anderson and Deborah Bialis, a married couple who saw a need for more detailed information after undergoing treatment for infertility themselves. FertilityIQ gathers information from more than 10,000 verified I.V.F. patients who contribute to its database. Employers examined in the report included companies where FertilityIQ\u2019s participants work, as well as additional employers identified by fertility clinics or researched by Fertility IQ itself, Mr. Anderson said.FertilityIQ\u2019s goal is to provide as much detail as possible, he said, to help people navigate their way through a stressful process. Mr. Anderson\u2019s advice to those seeking infertility treatment was simply, \u201cBuckle in, financially and emotionally.\u201dEmployer benefits are important, the couple said, because I.V.F. is costly and demand for it is increasing.Treatment isn\u2019t cheap. The cost of a single cycle of I.V.F. is often about $12,000, but that number is just a start. Drugs and related procedures, like genetic screening, push the average price in most major metropolitan areas to well above $20,000 per cycle, FertilityIQ found. And most couples undergo at least two cycles on average, Mr. Anderson said.The report ranks individual employers and broad sectors, based on criteria that include the value of the benefits and the ease with which employees can use them. Some companies rank higher because they avoid preauthorization rules, like trying unsuccessfully to conceive for a period of time or receiving a specific infertility diagnosis, that can be particularly restrictive for same-sex couples or single women, Mr. Anderson said.The technology industry, in particular, shines at making infertility benefits widely accessible, the report found, and some employers are in a sort of benefits arms race, offering more generous coverage to remain competitive in recruiting and retaining workers. Facebook ranks high on the list of tech companies, as it did in FertilityIQ\u2019s report last year. The company covers up to four I.V.F. cycles, including genetic testing, with no preapproval required. (FertilityIQ values the cycles at $25,000 each, for a total benefit value of $100,000.)Other tech companies are beefing up coverage, according to the new analysis.Microsoft is expanding its benefit in January, replacing a fixed amount of $15,000 with a more flexible offering. \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re providing industry-leading benefits,\u201d said Sonja Kellen, director of global health and wellness benefits at Microsoft.Microsoft will work with Progyny, a fertility benefits manager, to offer up to three treatment cycles. The benefit includes genetic testing as well as the freezing of eggs or embryos and storage for up to four years. The new policy makes treatment available to employees without demonstrated infertility issues, so gay couples pursuing parenthood through surrogacy or a single woman who wants to freeze eggs for use in the future can use the benefit.The new approach aims to make benefits more broadly available and helps reduce pressure on employees undergoing I.V.F. to maximize their benefit, Ms. Kellen said.For instance, a couple undergoing I.V.F. with a dollar cap on their employer benefit may decide to have multiple embryos transferred at one time, perhaps resulting in twins or triplets. Those pregnancies are more likely to have complications.Medications for the treatment are covered separately, through the company\u2019s prescription drug benefit, she said.Pinterest, the online social network, covered up to $20,000 for treatment costs this year, but will change its benefit in January to cover up to four rounds of I.V.F., said a company spokeswoman, Malorie Lucich. The expansion, she said, was based on feedback the company received from its 1,200 employees.\u201cIt\u2019s a very family friendly culture here,\u201d she said.Among other big tech companies, Google covers three cycles including genetic testing, a benefit that FertilityIQ values at $75,000, and Apple offers a $20,000 benefit. Neither company requires preapproval. Amazon\u2019s benefit of $15,000 with a required preauthorization placed it relatively low on FertilityIQ\u2019s list of tech companies.Some companies in consulting, like Bain, and finance, like Bank of America, offer unlimited I.V.F. benefits as long as employees meet preauthorization rules, the report found.Other financial companies offer more limited coverage, yet are moving to expand it. American Express, for instance, increased its cap for treatment this year to $35,000, up from $20,000, for full-time and part-time employees.Retail companies generally rank low on FertilityIQ\u2019s list, Mr. Anderson said, but Starbucks is notable for making a $15,000 I.V.F. benefit available, including to part-time store workers.Here are some questions and answers about infertility coverage:What should I do if my employer doesn\u2019t offer I.V.F. benefits?Employees can lobby their human resources departments to offer coverage, particularly if their employers are \u201cself insured\u201d \u2014 meaning the companies pay claims themselves, rather than paying a premium to an insurer, said Barbara Collura, president and chief executive of Resolve, an infertility support and advocacy group.Self-insured employers \u2014 typically companies with more than 250 workers \u2014 have more leeway to expand coverage, Ms. Collura said. Employers that don\u2019t self-insure have less flexibility because the benefits are determined by the insurer, she said.Eights states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island) require employers to offer some level of I.V.F. benefit, Ms. Collura said. But coverage isn\u2019t necessarily generous, and self-insured employers and small employers are typically exempt from the laws.Is financial help available for the cost of infertility treatment?What proportion of employers over all offer I.V.F. benefits?About a quarter of employers with 500 or more workers cover the procedure, while 37 percent of employers with 20,000 or more workers cover it, according to a 2017 report from the benefits consultant Mercer \u2014 about the same level found the previous year.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spelling Trouble: Did a Scrabble Champion Cheat?", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Tongues are wagging across the world of competitive Scrabble. Allan Simmons, one of the game\u2019s top-billed British players, has been barred from tournaments for three years after an inquiry concluded he had broken the rules of the word game.Mr. Simmons, a former British Scrabble champion who has written several books about the game, was accused of putting a hand with freshly drawn letter tiles back into a bag to draw more favorable tiles. Mr. Simmons has denied wrongdoing.The punishment, imposed by the Association of British Scrabble Players, made headlines in Britain.Yet many organizers of tournaments where a fluency with words may spell victory or defeat seemed to tilt toward reticence on Tuesday. For a game played in the glare of open competition, its inner machinations were more opaque.\u201cFor some unknown reason, I don\u2019t think they want it to be public,\u201d Len Moir, a tournament organizer in the English Midlands, said of the accusations against Mr. Simmons. \u201cHe is such a high-profile player.\u201dNicky Huitson, who is overseeing the Broadstairs Seaside Special in southern England next year, said the ban was \u201cnot very positive for the game, and that\u2019s why most of us don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201dWhen the news of the ban broke on Monday in The Times of London, Elie Dangoor, a leading figure in the Association of British Scrabble Players, said in a statement that Mr. Simmons had been \u201ca huge part of the game\u2019s development,\u201d adding, \u201cThere\u2019s no one person bigger than the game.\u201dThe tournament rules require players to show opponents their empty hands before they draw letter tiles from a cloth bag, so that they cannot be accused of dropping unfavorable letters back in. The bag is also supposed to be held at shoulder height, to prevent players from peeking at the tiles.Mr. Simmons, 60, could not be reached for comment on the accusations against him. But he told The Times of London that he had suffered the same \u201cuntimely bad luck from the bag as anyone else.\u201dMr. Simmons had written a weekly column for the The Times of London, but the newspaper said on Monday that he would \u201cno longer be a contributor.\u201dThe Scrabble group\u2019s inquiry began with a complaint about Mr. Simmons\u2019s behavior in the British Masters tournament last June. The organizers of the 2016 Scottish Masters tournament then came forward with similar allegations.\u201cThe natural conclusion had been that he had been cheating,\u201d Mr. Dangoor said. The inquiry into the complaints against Mr. Simmons ended several weeks ago, but news of the ban only recently reached a wider audience.It read: \u201cOn Sunday, at the Masters tournament, I witnessed Allan Simmons behaving suspiciously during our game. As a result, I strongly believe he was cheating. I should give some background to this incident.\u201dIt continued: \u201cIn September 2016, in Lille, I was sat waiting for my opponent for a round on day three. I was idly watching several other players play their games. One of those players was Allan. At one point, I was surprised to see him draw a tile, look at it, and return it to the bag, all at shoulder height. I thought I was seeing things at first \u2014 I was shocked to witness this at all. I said nothing to anyone at the time. On reflection, perhaps I should have.\u201dIn the drama of Mr. Simmons\u2019s exclusion, Amy Byrne resigned as chairwoman of the Association of British Scrabble Players, saying it was unusual to publicize bans. Contacted by telephone, Ms. Byrne declined to comment.For his part, Mr. Simmons told The Times of London, \u201cWhile I believe I always showed an open hand before drawing fresh letters, if drawing one or two at a time, I may not have always had an open hand for each dip of the bag.\u201d\u201cLikewise, holding the bag may not have always been strictly at shoulder height,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to remember that at the top level, games can be quite intense, and there\u2019s a lot going through one\u2019s mind, let alone remembering to religiously ensure tile-drawing rules are followed meticulously.\u201dMr. Simmons said he would not try to overturn the ban, in order to avoid creating a \u201cdistraction.\u201d In any event, he said, he had already been thinking about retiring from competitive play.\u201cI will rise above this issue and get on with more important things in life than playing Scrabble,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clearing the Air on Climate Education: A Reporter Returns to the Scene of Her Story", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Times in PersonOn Nov. 7, our national correspondent Amy Harmon returned to southeastern Ohio to participate in a discussion at Ohio University about teaching science in an era of public mistrust. Joining the conversation were Sami Kahn, assistant professor of science education; Dr. Bernhard Debatin, professor for multimedia policy; James Sutter, a science teacher at Wellston High School; and Katey King, Brogan Speraw and Dalton Teasley, former Wellston High School students.As a national correspondent, you learn to do stories and move on, no matter how much you might like to stay. It\u2019s the nature of the job: There is always another story waiting to be told.But recently, my editor asked me and several other correspondents to return, for public forums, to the areas of the country from where we had reported on the nation\u2019s political divide. The idea was that it would be to the benefit of our journalism, and our readers, for us to continue in person the sometimes fraught conversations our articles had helped to stoke.I cannot say that I embarked on this assignment without some trepidation.Some were the kind I had hoped for: \u201cOf course it\u2019s exasperating to see such strong scientific evidence rejected,\u201d read a comment about a student named Gwen Beatty. \u201cBut Gwen\u2019s sincerity and intelligence, and her real distress, come through clearly, as do the terrible economic pressures on the people of Wellston.\u201dOthers, though, excoriated the students, labeling them \u201cstupid,\u201d among other things. \u201cFolks,\u201d wrote one horrified reader, pushing back after a string of such comments on The Times\u2019s Facebook page, \u201cyou\u2019re talking about minors.\u201dSome readers, especially in southeastern Ohio itself, had objected to the way I\u2019d chosen to weave in information about the region\u2019s socioeconomic troubles, such as the opioid epidemic and the high poverty rate. \u201cWhat was gained by mentioning a child has to borrow lunch money?\u201d one tweeted. \u201cWhat did that add to the article?\u201dI had responded to some of these threads on social media last spring, but the prospect of doing so face to face was more unnerving. And who was to say that this was a conversation anyone in the area wanted to have?But it seemed I would not get out of it so easily.This fall, students in the education school at Ohio University in Athens, about 30 miles from Wellston, had been assigned by their professor, Sami Kahn, to read my article. And Dr. Kahn had invited James Sutter, the teacher I profiled, to speak at an event that was soon expanded to include me and some of the Wellston students I interviewed.The visit, as anticipated, had its tense moments.In a deep-red region, Athens is a liberal college town, and some community members took issue with what they saw as my kid-glove approach to climate skepticism among young Republicans (even those not yet of voting age).\u201cWrite about how they\u2019re being lied to,\u201d one social science professor instructed me at the reception. \u201cThat\u2019s what changes the minds of my students.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re past debating climate change,\u201d an environmental activist insisted.The Wellston students spoke openly of feeling betrayed by my mention of drugs, poverty and low enrollment in four-year colleges in an article I had told them would be about climate education.\u201cIn our town, we are just kind of trying to survive,\u201d said Katey King, now a freshman at the university. \u201cWe have a lot of pride.\u201dFor my part, I was glad we were discussing the often-ignored connection between attitudes toward climate change and economic inequality. And even as I defended my effort to explain to readers why climate change might not be a priority in Wellston, I knew I would be more mindful in the future of how certain facts might be misinterpreted as judgment.Tense moments aside, much of our conversation focused on Mr. Sutter\u2019s remarkable teaching. Like many of the students I met in Wellston, those on the panel had, in his classroom, come to consider climate change a serious problem, and to recognize human activities as its primary driver.There may be emotional safety in talking about your story at a physical remove from where it unfolded. But it is far more enlightening \u2014 and personally rewarding \u2014 to be there.A few days after I had returned from Athens, I received a direct message on Twitter from Jonathan Caldwell, a senior at Ohio University in St. Clairsville. \u201cI appreciate your work,\u201d he wrote. His education professor, Jacqueline Yahn, had apparently also distributed my article, which he had used for a class presentation on \u201chow we approach ideas like climate change (or any other topic that can be seen as controversial) and what responsibilities I believe we have as teachers.\u201dAt first I thought Mr. Caldwell, who grew up in eastern Ohio and is hoping to be the first in his family to graduate from college, was simply writing to make the connection.Then, a few days later, came the invitation: \u201cWe\u2019re a small campus here at Eastern. But we\u2019re really close here at the campus and I know we would love to learn from you & I think we could share a lot with you as well.\u201dI haven\u2019t discussed it with my editor yet. But maybe sometime soon I\u2019ll be heading back once again to Ohio.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Smuggled, Beaten and Drugged: The Illicit Global Ape Trade", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "The New York Times tracked international ape smugglers from Congolese rain forests to the back streets of Bangkok. Here is what unfolded.Supported byMBANDAKA, Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 The sting began, as so many things do these days, on social media.Daniel Stiles, a self-styled ape trafficking detective in Kenya, had been scouring Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp for weeks, looking for pictures of gorillas, chimps or orangutans. He was hoping to chip away at an illicit global trade that has captured or killed tens of thousands of apes and pushed some endangered species to the brink of extinction.\u201cThe way they do business,\u201d he said of ape traffickers, \u201cmakes the Mafia look like amateurs.\u201dAfter hundreds of searches, Mr. Stiles found an Instagram account offering dozens of rare animals for sale, including baby chimpanzees and orangutans dressed in children\u2019s clothes. He sent an email to an address on the account \u2014 \u201clooking for young otans\u201d (the industry standard slang for orangutans) \u2014 and several days later received a reply.\u201c2 babies, 7.5k each. Special introductory price.\u201dSeveral weeks later, after a few more rounds of text messages with Tom to firm up the details, Mr. Stiles decided to fly to Bangkok.\u201cI was way out on a limb,\u201d Mr. Stiles admitted later. But he was eager to bring down Tom, who indicated that he could find orangutans and chimps with only a few days\u2019 notice, the mark of a major dealer.Malnourished and terrified apes have been seized across the world, in undercover busts or at border checkpoints, in countries as varied as France, Nepal, Thailand, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Kuwait. Two years ago, at Cairo\u2019s international airport, the Egyptian authorities discovered a baby chimp curled up into a ball and stashed in a piece of hand luggage. Just this summer, the authorities in Cameroon stopped a smuggler at a roadblock who was trying to move 100 pounds of pangolin scales and a tiny chimp, not even a month old, hidden in a plastic sack.But for every successful bust, wildlife specialists say, five to 10 other animals slip through. And for every smuggled ape, several more may have been killed in the process. Most species of apes are social and live in large groups, and poachers often wipe out entire families to get their hands on a single infant, which is far easier to smuggle.Wildlife researchers say that a secret ape pipeline runs from the lush forests of central Africa and Southeast Asia, through loosely policed ports in the developing world, terminating in wealthy homes and unscrupulous zoos thousands of miles away. The pipeline, documents show, is lubricated by corrupt officials (several have been arrested for falsifying export permits) and run by transnational criminal gangs that have recently drawn the attention of Interpol, the international law enforcement network.Apes are big business \u2014 a gorilla baby can cost as much as $250,000 \u2014 but who exactly is buying these animals is often as opaque as the traffickers\u2019 identity. Many times, researchers say, they can only begin to track where the apes have ended up by stumbling across the Facebook posts and YouTube videos of rich pet collectors.\u201cThis is sick,\u201d Mr. Stiles said as he pulled up a picture of a small chimpanzee wearing lipstick. \u201cYou got this poor animal, without its mother, without any other members of its own species, totally bewildered and terrorized, all for human amusement.\u201dWildlife officials said that a handful of Western businessmen had also been arrested. But the majority of recent busts, they added, have been in Africa or Southeast Asia, usually of low-level traffickers or poorly paid underlings, not the bosses who control underground exports and travel abroad to make deals.For years wildlife officials suspected that a mysterious American known simply as \u201cJoe\u201d was running a large trafficking ring out of Thailand, one of the world hubs for smuggled apes. According to \u201cTom,\u201d the trafficker Mr. Stiles discovered, \u201cJoe\u201d had recently retired.And it\u2019s not as if smuggling is the only threat apes face. The world\u2019s hunger for biofuels and palm oil \u2014 a cheap food product used in things like lipstick, instant noodles and Oreos \u2014 is leveling tropical rain forests and turning them into farms.\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at,\u201d he added, \u201cis endgame conservation.\u201dMost apes, which include gorillas, gibbons, orangutans, chimpanzees and bonobos, live deep in the rain forest. The Basankusu region of Congo, lying along a tributary of the legendary Congo River, is one of the last bonobo refuges and a source of many trafficked apes.It\u2019s not easy getting here. We flew from Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, to Mbandaka, a river town where 50-foot dugout canoes arrive every morning, edging into shore crammed with products of the forest: onions, eggplants, buckets of red-skinned peanuts, dead pangolins, dead turtles, dead monkeys and, occasionally, live apes.From Mbandaka, we hired a canoe and motored upriver, our long, narrow boat slicing through the tannin-rich water like a pencil. We made it to the bonobo habitat, amazed to see wild bonobos quietly staring down at us from the highest branches of the trees.In central African towns (as elsewhere in the world), many chimpanzees are kept as pets. Congo\u2019s president, Joseph Kabila, who lives in a riverside mansion in Kinshasa, the capital, has a large chimp locked up in a cage. At the Hotel Benghazi in Mbandaka, the owner had kept a muscular mascot for years: Antoine, a large male chimp who scraped an empty soda bottle against the iron bars of his garbage-strewn cage, like an inmate. (Antoine escaped in January and, after sowing disorder in Mbandaka, was hunted down by police officers, shot 10 times and left dead on a city street.)As one leaves the towns and travels into the thick forests, the use of apes changes. Out here, as in remote parts of Southeast Asia, where many people are poor and desperate for protein, apes are also food.But a baby was different, he said. There was a specific market for infant apes, so he would sell them alive, for at least $10 each, to local traders who would then smuggle them to Kinshasa and sell them to foreigners for many times that amount.\u201cBonobos are clever,\u201d Mr. Mange said. If they get their feet stuck in a trap, they don\u2019t screech wildly in panic, like pigs or other animals, which would reveal their location to the hunters. Instead, he said, bonobos quietly try to untangle the snare without being detected.In Boende, a small town up another tributary of the Congo River, three hunters were recently caught with bonobo carcasses and sentenced to several years in a stifling colonial-era prison. The men said they were simply trying to feed their families by selling bonobo meat. But poaching an ape is a serious crime in Congo, and nonprofit wildlife groups have been assisting the Congolese authorities in prosecuting offenders.\u201cThere is a culture here to eat meat, meat from the forest,\u201d said the town\u2019s prosecutor, Willy Ndjoko Kesidi. \u201cMe, I like fish.\u201dMr. Kesidi expressed some sympathy for the hunters he had just jailed, saying that the prison where they were housed was a horrible place where many prisoners had died.\u201cIf you spend a lot of time in there,\u201d Mr. Kesidi said, \u201cthe color of your skin changes.\u201dFor years, Mr. Stiles has performed undercover research on wildlife trafficking across Africa, but recently his work has taken him off the continent. A big, freckled, gregarious man, he favors wearing baggy shorts and wrinkled safari shirts. He has also invented several false online identities, with webpages that depict him as an active buyer of rare animals.Many illegal wildlife transactions start online, specifically through Instagram or WhatsApp. Mr. Stiles has made several trips to the United Arab Emirates, which he considers a new hub for the illegal online wildlife business. Dealers in the Middle East have posted many pictures of apes for sale, sometimes advertising them as friendly pets for children.Disturbing stories often lie behind those pictures. Many chimps have been drugged with muscle relaxers or alcohol to make them easier to handle. Some are trained to smoke cigarettes and guzzle beer. Orangutans are gentler than chimps, but still, they are not always gentle, and investigators say zoo trainers sometimes beat them with lead pipes wrapped in rolled-up newspapers to force them to perform tricks. Several years ago, the Indonesian police rescued a female orangutan who had been shaved and was being used as a prostitute at a brothel.\u201cEven if we can rescue them, it\u2019s very difficult reintroducing them to the wild,\u201d said Mr. Cress, the former head of the United Nations Great Apes program. \u201cThey\u2019re all goofed up. They need serious rehab. The ones who have been given alcohol, their hands shake. They have the same withdrawal symptoms we do.\u201dInternational wildlife regulations prohibit the trade of endangered apes for commercial purposes. While zoos and other educational institutions are allowed to acquire apes, they need permits showing, among other things, that the apes were bred in captivity, not captured in the wild. (All great ape species are endangered; most gibbons species are as well.)It\u2019s relatively easy to falsify permits, though, and wildlife investigators have tracked illegally sold apes to Iraq, China, Dubai and Bangkok\u2019s Safari World zoo, where orangutans have been trained to wear boxing gloves and spar with each other to howls of laughter.But the boxing shows continue, with a new set of animals, despite an outcry from wildlife groups. Safari World executives said that none of their animals were abused and that the orangutans were fed \u201chuman-grade fruits\u201d and lived in air-conditioned rooms.They also said it wasn\u2019t their fault that the authorities had discovered that some of their orangutans had been improperly acquired from Indonesia. Safari World said it relied on third-party suppliers, and the zoo insisted that most of its apes had been born in Thailand.\u201cWhen you come to our park,\u201d said Litti Kewkacha, its executive vice president, \u201cyou will only see smiles on our orangutans.\u201dTo arrange his orangutan sting, Mr. Stiles checked into the Landmark hotel in Bangkok. From a quiet room overlooking clogged arteries of traffic, he began sending the wildlife trafficker Tom messages on WhatsApp.Over the next few days, with Inspector X and other agents lurking in his high-rise hotel room, Mr. Stiles exchanged more WhatsApp messages with Tom, trying to arrange a meet-up. A couple of times, they even talked on the phone. Tom\u2019s real identity remained a mystery. He had a Malaysian or Indonesian accent, spoke English fluently and was never at a loss for words.\u201cOh man, you\u2019re going to have some fun,\u201d Tom said about the orangutan babies. \u201cGetting ready for some sleepless nights?\u201dIn late December, the day of the meet-up, Inspector X and the other Thai agents staked out the appointed location \u2014 a supermarket parking lot in central Bangkok. A taxi pulled up.Inspector X and the agents pounced, arresting the driver and discovering two baby orangutans in the back seat, clutching each other. They appeared scared but healthy, and have since been sent to a Thai wildlife sanctuary. But Tom was nowhere to be found.Mr. Stiles was overjoyed that the orangutans were rescued, but he was frustrated, too. \u201cWe got to get to the dealers,\u201d he said.Since the sting, he has been back on Instagram, looking for more apes. And more Toms.Advertisement"}

And to be violated, to feel frozen, like you have to take it and you\u2019re wrong and scared \u2014 and now you\u2019re ashamed to have been touched that way.

{"Headline": "How Prosecutors Turn a Protest Into a \u2018Riot\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorA year ago, I was finalizing plans to leave a chemical engineering Ph.D. program and join the tech sector. But as Inauguration Day approached, I became so disgusted by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s behavior that I felt it would have been negligent to remain a bystander. So I traveled from Baltimore to join hundreds of thousands of protesters at counterdemonstrations around Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing-in.Little did I know that I would be swept up into a legal nightmare that demonstrates how prosecutors intimidate and manipulate defendants into giving up their rights.Minutes after I got to downtown Washington on Jan. 20, police officers used pepper spray, \u201csting-ball\u201d grenades and flailing batons to sweep up an entire city block in a mass-arrest tactic known as \u201ckettling.\u201d I was among the more than 230 people confined at 12th and L Streets with no access to food, water or bathrooms for up to eight hours.That much can be gleaned from public legal filings connected to our criminal prosecutions, as well as a lawsuit filed on behalf of me and three other plaintiffs by the American Civil Liberties Union. (One of this case\u2019s many paradoxes is that I\u2019ve been advised not to talk publicly about what happened before my arrest.)Throughout this disruptive legal adventure, the government has failed to provide most defendants in the case with evidence of their alleged individual wrongdoing. For example, I was offered a plea deal (to a single misdemeanor charge) on the basis of virtually nothing more than being at the site of the protest. Many of my co-defendants report similar experiences. Yet we remain under indictment for multiple felonies, with all the disruption and fear that brings.As these cases have progressed, I have been trapped in a liminal state \u2014 between careers, away from my home city, weighed down by constant uncertainty about the future \u2014 for nearly a year. I have to be present for the many hearings, which, for financial reasons, has required me to live in Washington.And this serves to illustrate a critical problem in the American justice system: Prosecutors have the power to single-handedly destroy lives, and there are few consequences for abuse of that power. At the same time, their main measure of success is the ability to secure convictions, not the degree to which justice is served.The trouble starts with the indictment process, in which prosecutors present their case to a grand jury in secret, without any opposing viewpoint, and get what they ask for a vast majority of the time. Most indictments end in a plea deal, bypassing the oversight of a judge and jury. Prosecutors also dictate the terms of these somewhat Faustian bargains, often pursuing excessive charges as a form of intimidation. If you\u2019re innocent, you are faced with the choice of a lifelong criminal record or the heavy social and financial burdens that come along with due process.To further complicate the ethics of a plea-based justice system, prosecutors can use family members as tools to extract pleas. In my case, I was arrested along with my fianc\u00e9, and the \u201cevidence\u201d presented against us was similar. In hopes of securing two convictions rather than one, prosecutors told us that our plea deals were contingent on convincing the other to plead out.Unlike more than 90 percent of criminal defendants in this country, my co-defendants and I have chosen to take our cases to trial. I can\u2019t speak to all of their motives, but I was unwilling to capitulate to a system dominated by petty tyrants willing to win at any cost.But more important, this is no isolated injustice from an unusually malicious prosecutor. Similar stories play out across America, often in communities where people lack access to adequate legal assistance, or the personal resources to fight a protracted legal battle. It\u2019s time for us to confront the true implications of our society\u2019s promise that we are innocent until proven guilty.Advertisement"}

Like many Americans, I\u2019m well acquainted with the traditional dishes. (But sadly, if the waiter then tries to engage me in conversation, I can only stammer that it\u2019s such a lovely day.)Involtini made with meat may be simmered in a sauce, grilled or baked in a hot oven, depending on the cook\u2019s inclination and the meat\u2019s inherent tenderness. In the United States, Sicilian-Americans refer to involtini as \u201cbraciole,\u201d which are most often braised in a tomato sauce.Stuffing a thin slice of meat is a frugal practice, since each piece may weigh only two or three ounces. It is a way to stretch the budget and give everyone in the family a little bit of something meaty and delicious.Everyone makes involtini in Sicily, or you can buy them ready-to-cook in any butcher shop. They\u2019re diminutive, no bigger than an egg, really. But one or two involtini with a juicy vegetable and a green salad makes a fine meal.To make involtini di carne, buy very thin veal scallops. (A butcher will be able to pound them to your specifications, about 1/8-inch thick.). Cook a finely diced red onion until softened, then combine it with minced ham, cheese, herbs and rough bread crumbs for the filling. Place a spoonful of filling on each slice and roll the meat into a little bundle. The next step is to thread the bundles on two skewers (to seal them closed and help them keep their shape), placing a bay leaf, a piece of onion and a small slice of bread between the bundles.Lastly, place the skewers on a baking sheet, daub them liberally with olive oil and sprinkle with a coating of fine bread crumbs. As the dish bakes, the bay leaf and onion will perfume the dish, and the bread bits will become crunchy, golden croutons.When they emerge from the oven smelling heavenly, call everyone to the table.

The first thing I thought of was my vehicle: I filled up the tank for just in case. That was devastating when we had to wait in lines for five, six and seven hours.\u201dMs. Cuprill was not worried about any food purchases: she had not been foolhardy enough to buy perishables. Many areas where the power had returned had suffered continuous glitches, damaging appliances and fraying nerves.\u201cI buy food every day,\u201d Ms. Cuprill said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust what they say. They say the power will be back in 19 hours. I will believe that when I see it.\u201dIn a statement Thursday afternoon, the Puerto Rican government said that workers had made progress toward the repairs and that equipment was being put in place to restore the service.Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez said the electric company, known as Prepa, would focus first on bringing the lights back to hospitals, airports, fire stations and areas that are crucial to the economy. He said the most affected areas were in the San Juan metropolitan area, including the cities of Vega Baja, Arecibo, Barceloneta, Manat\u00ed, Bayam\u00f3n, San Juan and areas near Can\u00f3vanas.The power failure was the latest blow for Puerto Rico\u2019s beleaguered and bankrupt power company, which has been criticized for awarding a small Montana firm a $300 million contract to fix power lines that included highly unusual clauses that prohibited any audits.

He was trying to find the bullet marks.Mr. Long, 63, had been sitting in a pew with his parents when he heard a commotion behind him. He knelt down by one of the dying, Kenneth A. Truitt, his best friend\u2019s father. \u201cHe just looked at me and said, \u2018It hurts, Junior,\u2019\u201d Mr. Long said. \u201cI took my jacket off and put it under his head.\u201dThe two shootings, one in an unincorporated community southeast of San Antonio and the other in a blue-collar steel-mill town northeast of Dallas, unfolded at roughly the same moment during Sunday morning services \u2014 at about 11:20 a.m. They were both carried out by gunmen who barged through the front doors dressed for war in bulletproof vests and armed with military-style AR-15 rifles and pistols. Like in Sutherland Springs, the pastor in Daingerfield was out that Sunday, and the gunman was driven by revenge and eventually took his own life.And although the recent shooting was far worse with 26 dead, the two attacks were ultimately brought to an end by bystanders who risked their lives to save others.\u201cI think everyone who was here on June 22, 1980, has a sense of empathy with Sutherland Springs,\u201d said Mr. Long, as he stood in the vestibule. \u201cWe know what it was like to be interrupted at a place that you think is safe by gunfire.\u201d\u201cDear Evil,\u201d wrote Mr. Crisp, a Baptist pastor himself. \u201cYou can\u2019t win. I\u2019ve read the Book. You lose. You just sent 26 people to Heaven. How is that a win for you?\u201dHere in the piney woods of East Texas, not far from the Arkansas and Louisiana state lines, First Baptist\u2019s journey after the shooting provides a rough road map for what lies ahead for the Sutherland Springs church. The recovery has been hard, slow, improvised.Worshipers, many of whom either survived the shooting or are relatives of those wounded or killed, still gather every Sunday, face the pulpit, put their backs to the front doors and sing gospel hymns, as they did 37 years ago. They no longer worship in the yellow brick building. A new red brick sanctuary was built behind the old one in 1986. The old sanctuary was turned into a fellowship hall.Those who survived the attack get tears in their eyes when they talk about Mr. Truitt and Mr. McDaniel, a railroad worker and local baseball player everyone called Red because of his hair. They say they owe their lives to Mr. Truitt, Mr. McDaniel and Christopher Hall, the third man who tackled the gunman, and that the shooting in Daingerfield could have been far deadlier than the one in Sutherland Springs were it not for their actions.The congregation was in the middle of \u201cMore About Jesus\u201d when Mr. King started shooting. Mr. Hall jumped on Mr. King\u2019s back. Then Mr. McDaniel and Mr. Truitt came down the center aisle.\u201cI think now in 2017 it would register on me clearly what was happening,\u201d said Steve Cowan, who was sitting in church and is now the local district attorney. \u201cBut in 1980 it was a different time. It was so unexpected to be in a small church on Sunday morning, singing a hymn with the people that you\u2019ve grown up with in a town of 3,000 and see someone dressed up basically as a combat soldier and enter with assault rifles.\u201dThe First Baptist survivors have struggled for years with nightmares. They spoke of their lingering anxiety and fear as they sit in church on Sundays. Some started carrying concealed weapons into church after the shooting, and First Baptist created a security team that patrols the perimeter during Sunday services. Members of the church take turns serving on the team.\u201cI carried a gun with me when I patrolled,\u201d said Gary Pollan, 76, who had been in the church that day with his wife and two children and who now attends another Baptist church in Daingerfield. \u201cYou won\u2019t catch me at church without a pocketknife, at least.\u201dMr. Pollan\u2019s wife, Judy, 74, who hid her 10-year-old daughter and her daughter\u2019s friend under a pew, recalled going back to the church the Sunday after the 1980 shooting. \u201cThere was a lady across the way from us, she had a walking cane,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had hooked it on the back of her seat. And it fell off on that hardwood floor, and it just popped, and it nearly scared me to death.\u201dBo Stevens\u2019s mother also hid him and his little sister under a pew that day, and he remembers peeking his head out enough to see a haunting sight: the gun smoke wafting in the sunlight coming through the stained-glass windows. He was 9. Months later, he was at a college football game with his family, and a cannon boomed after a touchdown.\u201cI remember this flash of terror at that sound,\u201d said Mr. Stevens, 47, who became a Baptist pastor in nearby Naples and who said that the shooting \u2014 and the bravery of those three men \u2014 ultimately drew him closer to church. \u201cThey were heroes that day, real ones, and I\u2019m here because of them.

The article was engaged with at least 1.1 million times, making it the most-shared article about abortion on Facebook last year, according to BuzzSumo, a company that tracks social sharing.Last week, the company\u2019s general counsel appeared before Congress alongside his counterparts from Twitter and Google to testify on the company\u2019s role in distributing misinformation ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Facebook says it\u2019s taking \u201cfake news\u201d seriously. It has a label for \u201cdisputed\u201d stories, brought in independent fact-checking partners and allows users to report false articles.It\u2019s not clear whether these attempts to tackle misinformation will work; critics have called them ineffective and slow. But there\u2019s another problem, too. So far, Facebook and the public have focused almost solely on politics and Russian interference in the United States election. What they haven\u2019t addressed is the vast amount of misinformation and unevidenced stories about reproductive rights, science and health.Evidence-based, credible articles about abortion from reputable news outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post didn\u2019t make it to the top of the list of \u201cmost shared\u201d articles on Facebook last year, according to BuzzSumo. But articles from the site LifeNews.com did.Facebook\u2019s current initiatives to crack down on fake news can, theoretically, be applicable to misinformation on other issues. However, there are several human and technical barriers that prevent misinformation about reproductive rights from being identified, checked and removed at the same \u2014 already slow \u2014 rate as other misleading stories.However, the incentive for the people who write content for anti-abortion news sites and Facebook pages is ideological, not financial. Anti-abortion, anti-science content isn\u2019t being written by spammers hoping to make money, but by ordinary people who are driven by religious or political beliefs. Their aim isn\u2019t to profit from ads. It\u2019s to convince readers of their viewpoint: that abortion is morally wrong, that autism is caused by vaccines or that climate change isn\u2019t real.Finally, public pressure influences where Facebook directs its attention. Facebook may be focused on fake news and the United States election now, but its efforts to prevent the spread of misinformation in the buildup to the election were practically nonexistent. It took action only after intense scrutiny.Now Facebook and its fact-checking partners say its focus is \u201con the worst of the worst, on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain.\u201d Simply put, without increased pressure, Facebook\u2019s technical efforts and its human efforts, like fact-checkers\u2019 trawling through flagged content, make it likely that the company, in the months to come, will be seeking out only the \u201cobvious\u201d flags of fake news stories and not the misinformation that is fueled by real people with no financial incentive. That is why those of us who are concerned by the misinformation around reproductive rights need to make ourselves heard.The Irish government says it will hold a referendum next year on whether to relax the country\u2019s strict ban on abortion. Some abortion-rights campaigners have expressed concern over the role of misinformation on social media platforms like Facebook in the lead-up to the vote, but it\u2019s far from clear whether those concerns are being listened to.Curbing the spread of fake news is no easy task, and Facebook says it cannot \u201cbecome arbiters of truth\u201d in the fight against fake news. But at the very least, the company can address its continuing role in inadvertently spreading false information about issues that go beyond the United States election and Russia.Rossalyn Warren (@rossalynwarren) is a journalist who regularly covers women\u2019s rights and internet culture.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Political Clashes in Kenya Leave Several Dead", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe police fired water cannons and tear gas as Mr. Odinga\u2019s convoy made its way to Upper Hill in central Nairobi where he addressed supporters. The unrest was broadcast on live television. The police denied that they had fired their weapons or killed anyone, despite several reports by witnesses and journalists to the contrary.Opposition lawmakers had vowed to put at least one million protesters in the streets, but the police warned that they would not allow a rally to welcome Mr. Odinga back from speaking engagements in the United States.Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s second win is also being challenged at the Supreme Court, which is expected to make a decision on Monday.The Associated Press reported that one person had been killed in the clashes, and Agence-France Presse said that one of its reporters saw the bodies of three men who had been shot to death on a road in Muthurwa, a suburb where riot police officers armed with tear gas, water cannons and rifles clashed with stone-throwing protesters.Reached by The New York Times to comment on the report of three deaths, George Kinoti, a spokesman for the National Police Service, asked for evidence. \u201cIf yes, let him or her share with us.

At least 70 people have died in political unrest since then, most of them opposition demonstrators and residents in opposition strongholds shot by the police.\u201cIn the face of this shameful police brutality and serious violations of human rights to life and physical security, the Uhuru Kenyatta government has remained mute and at times cheered the police on and made alarming statements in support of horrifying police actions,\u201d a rights activist, Ndungu Wainaina, told The Associated Press.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Our Love Affair With Digital Is Over", "Date": "2017-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionLike most relationships we plunge into with hearts aflutter, our love affair with digital technology promised us the world: more friends, money and democracy! Free music, news and same-day shipping of paper towels! A laugh a minute, and a constant party at our fingertips.Many of us bought into the fantasy that digital made everything better. We surrendered to this idea, and mistook our dependence for romance, until it was too late.Today, when my phone is on, I feel anxious and count down the hours to when I am able to turn it off and truly relax. The love affair I once enjoyed with digital technology is over \u2014 and I know I\u2019m not alone.Ten years after the iPhone first swept us off our feet, the growing mistrust of computers in both our personal lives and the greater society we live in is inescapable. This publishing season is flush with books raising alarms about digital technology\u2019s pernicious effects on our lives: what smartphones are doing to our children; how Facebook and Twitter are eroding our democratic institutions; and the economic effects of tech monopolies.So what now?As much as we might fantasize about it, we probably won\u2019t delete our social media accounts and toss our phones in the nearest body of water. What we can do is to restore some sense of balance over our relationship with digital technology, and the best way to do that is with analog: the ying to digital\u2019s yang.This surprising reversal of fortune for these apparently \u201cobsolete\u201d analog technologies is too often written off as nostalgia for a predigital time. But younger consumers who never owned a turntable and have few memories of life before the internet drive most of the current interest in analog, and often include those who work in Silicon Valley\u2019s most powerful companies.Analog, although more cumbersome and costly than its digital equivalents, provides a richness of experience that is unparalleled with anything delivered through a screen. People are buying books because a book engages nearly all of their senses, from the smell of the paper and glue to the sight of the cover design and weight of the pages read, the sound of those sheets turning, and even the subtle taste of the ink on your fingertips. A book can be bought and sold, given and received, and displayed on a shelf for anyone to see. It can start conversations and cultivate romances.The limits of analog, which were once seen as a disadvantage, are increasingly one of the benefits people are turning to as a counterweight to the easy manipulation of digital. Though a page of paper is limited by its physical size and the permanence of the ink that marks it, there is a powerful efficiency in that simplicity. The person holding the pen above that notebook page is free to write, doodle or scribble her idea however she wishes between those borders, without the restrictions or distractions imposed by software.In a world of endless email chains, group chats, pop-up messages or endlessly tweaked documents and images, the walled garden of analog saves both time and inspires creativity. Web designers at Google have been required to use pen and paper as a first step when brainstorming new projects for the past several years, because it leads to better ideas than those begun on a screen.In contrast with the virtual \u201ccommunities\u201d we have built online, analog actually contributes to the real places where we live. I have become friendly with Ian Cheung, the appropriately opinionated owner of June Records, up the street from my home in Toronto. I benefit not only from the tax revenues that June Records contributes as a local business (paving the roads, paying my daughter\u2019s teachers) but also from living nearby. Like the hardware store, Italian grocer and butcher on the same block, the brick and mortar presence of June adds to my neighborhood\u2019s sense of place (i.e., a place with a killer selection of Cannonball Adderley and local indie albums) and gives me a feeling of belonging. I also have no doubts that, unlike Twitter, Ian would immediately kick out any Nazi or raving misogynist who started ranting inside his store.Analog excels particularly well at encouraging human interaction, which is crucial to our physical and mental well-being. The dynamic of a teacher working in a classroom full of students has not only proven resilient, but has outperformed digital learning experiments time and again. Digital may be extremely efficient in transferring pure information, but learning happens best when we build upon the relationships between students, teachers and their peers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teaching the Russian Revolution With The New York Times", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal IssuesShould the Russian Revolution be remembered as one of history\u2019s great turning points \u2014 or should it be \u201crelegated to the dustbin of history\u201d given that the new nation it created, the Soviet Union, no longer exists?This month is the 100th anniversary of the October Revolution (which now falls in November, given a different calendar). In 1917, Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks orchestrated an extraordinary coup that created the world\u2019s first communist state. The centennial presents an opportunity for students to reflect on its significance. Below, we suggest a range of activities that use materials both from the current New York Times and from the newspaper\u2019s archives._________Warm UpStudents, working in pairs or small groups, should come up with a list of criteria to decide what historical events should be commemorated by a nation 100 years later.Here are some questions for students to consider as they come up with their list:Then, have students share their criteria with the class. What standards do they agree on? In what ways do they disagree?Then ask students to briefly respond to this prompt in writing \u2014 based on the criteria they decided on, and on what they already know from studying history:Should Russia commemorate the Russian Revolution on its 100th anniversary? Why or why not?But, don\u2019t have students share until after they do the activity below._________ActivityHave students read the article and answer the questions that follow. The article begins:The Kremlin plans to sit out the centenary of the Russian Revolution.Never mind that the upheavals of 1917 transformed the country and the world, abruptly ending the long rule of the czars, ushering in the Communist era and spawning an ideological confrontation with the West that still resonates.There will be no national holiday on Sunday, March 12, the date generally recognized as the start of the uprising. Nor will there even be a government-issued official interpretation, like the one mandating that World War II was a \u201cGreat Victory.\u201dThe official reason proffered for ignoring the event is that Russia remains too divided over the consequences of that fateful year.The more likely explanation, some Kremlin officials, historians and other analysts say, is that President Vladimir V. Putin loathes the very idea of revolution, not to mention the thought of Russians dancing in the streets to celebrate the overthrow of any ruler. Moreover, 1917 smudges the Kremlin\u2019s version of Russian history as a long, unified march to greatness, meant to instill a sense of national pride and purpose.Questions for Writing and DiscussionThen, have students hold a Socratic seminar, panel discussion or class debate on whether the Russian Revolution should be officially and grandly commemorated in Russia. These prompts might be helpful:To gather additional evidence for the debate, students can also read these opinion pieces:_________Below, we present a variety of activities for studying the Russian Revolution in more depth.1. Make a social media account documenting the Russian Revolution.2. Uncover something new in the Times archives.On March 8, 1917, Russia\u2019s February Revolution (so called because of the Old Style calendar used by Russians at the time) began with rioting and strikes in St. Petersburg.On Nov. 7, 1917, Russia\u2019s Bolshevik Revolution took place as forces led by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin overthrew the provisional government of Alexander Kerensky.On July 16, 1918, Russia\u2019s Czar Nicholas II, his wife and their five children were executed by the Bolsheviks.On Jan. 21, 1924, the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ilyich Lenin died at age 53.3. Write an obituary or deliver a eulogy for the Soviet Union.The Soviet state, marked throughout its brief but tumultuous history by great achievement and terrible suffering, died today after a long and painful decline. It was 74 years old.Conceived in utopian promise and born in the violent upheavals of the \u201cGreat October Revolution of 1917,\u201d the union heaved its last in the dreary darkness of late December 1991, stripped of ideology, dismembered, bankrupt and hungry \u2014 but awe-inspiring even in its fall.Then, assign students to write their own obituary or eulogy. Consider: How should the end of the Soviet Union be seen, especially on this centennial of its birth?4. Write a historical analysis essay in the spirit of the essays included in The Times\u2019s Red Century collection._________How have you taught the Russian Revolution?

{"Headline": "Who Will Be Running Consumer Agency on Monday? It\u2019s Unclear", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCome Monday morning, who will be running the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau? Over the weekend, the answer wasn\u2019t clear.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick. Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement was intended to thwart a move by Mr. Cordray earlier in the day to elevate an official from inside the agency to take on temporary leadership of the bureau.Now, both sides say the law is in their favor, setting up a clash that may well end up in court.President Trump and his administration are working to roll back regulations on businesses. The consumer bureau has been a prominent holdout. When Congress created it six years ago, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it gave the agency broad powers over a wide variety of financial products, including mortgages, credit cards, bank accounts and student loans.But the bureau has long been vilified by Republicans as an overreaching, aggressive arm of government.Installing Mr. Mulvaney, a fiscal hawk who previously called the agency a \u201csick, sad\u201d joke, as the agency\u2019s interim leader would immediately alter the consumer bureau\u2019s focus.Two White House officials, speaking to reporters in a briefing call on Saturday, cited guidance from the Office of Legal Counsel, part of the Justice Department, as legal grounds for Mr. Trump\u2019s move.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to name his own temporary director was a \u201ctypical, routine move,\u201d said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The official later said, \u201cWe have gone out of our way to avoid any unnecessary legal battle with Mr. Cordray,\u201d adding that \u201chis actions clearly indicate he is trying to provoke one.\u201dThe 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which established the bureau \u2014 and gave it unusual independence from Congress and the president \u2014 laid out a succession path in the case of the director\u2019s \u201cabsence or unavailability,\u201d the office acknowledged. The deputy director then steps in as the agency\u2019s acting head, according to the act.But that law \u201cdoes not displace the president\u2019s authority under the Vacancies Reform Act,\u201d wrote Steven A. Engel, the assistant attorney general in charge of the office.But the consumer bureau holds a different legal view.Mr. Cordray cited the Dodd-Frank Act when he followed up his resignation announcement on Friday with a letter naming the agency\u2019s chief of staff, Leandra English, as deputy director. Mr. Cordray said he expected Ms. English to take over from him.Democrats, who fought for the bureau\u2019s creation and championed its work as a valuable defense against predatory companies and abusive financial practices, are likely to push for a legal challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s move.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who proposed the consumer bureau and helped set it up, said Mr. Trump\u2019s move was legally impermissible.Former Representative Barney Frank, a co-author of the act, said the consumer bureau is \u201cdifferent in every way\u201d from other federal agencies and was intended to have more autonomy.\u201cWe gave a lot of attention to how to structure the C.F.P.B. and how to protect its independence, because its job is to go after some very powerful forces in the economy,\u201d Mr. Frank, who wrote the law with Christopher Dodd, then a senator, said in an interview on CNN.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to appoint Mr. Mulvaney is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Mr. Frank told CNN. Asked how the move could be challenged, he answered, \u201cI literally don\u2019t know.\u201dSome legal experts say there is reason to question whether the Federal Vacancies Reform Act supersedes an individual agency\u2019s designated line of succession.The Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s views are generally considered binding on the executive branch, but the judiciary is not constrained by them. Courts have, at times, disagreed with the office\u2019s legal interpretations \u2014 and their rulings take precedence.\u201cAny Office of Legal Counsel, in any administration, would have given the same answer with respect to this issue,\u201d said Aditya Bamzai, a law professor at the University of Virginia. \u201cBut if we see a legal challenge, the executive branch\u2019s positions don\u2019t always prevail in court.\u201dStephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said it was an \u201copen question\u201d which act \u2014 the vacancies law or Dodd-Frank \u2014 should take precedence, especially because Dodd-Frank was enacted more recently.On a mailing list for administrative law professors, a debate broke out on Saturday over specifics of the two laws. Experts argued about the nuances of various bits of fine print, including how individual words like \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d should be interpreted.Confirming a permanent director for the agency could take months. Mr. Cordray\u2019s confirmation was delayed for two years by Republicans and the banking industry, two parties that objected to the agency\u2019s creation and sought to limit the attempt at federal oversight.If he takes office, Mr. Mulvaney will shoulder his new job as acting chief on top of his role as director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is unclear how he will manage both. Administration officials directed all questions about the mechanics of the situation to Mr. Mulvaney.\u201cWe think he\u2019ll show up Monday, go into the office and start working,\u201d an administration official said of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s plans.But it may not be that simple. The next move lies with Ms. English: She will need to decide whether to mount a legal challenge against Mr. Mulvaney for the bureau\u2019s leadership, or to defer to him.\u201cIt\u2019s a very awkward legal scenario if they both show up literally at the same office,\u201d said Andy Grewal, a law professor at the University of Iowa. \u201cIt seems like both sides are trying to engage in gamesmanship here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kremlin Cash Behind Billionaire\u2019s Twitter and Facebook Investments", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "The Paradise PapersLeaked files show that a state-controlled bank in Moscow helped to fuel Yuri Milner\u2019s ascent in Silicon Valley, where the Russia investigation has put tech companies under scrutiny.Supported byNow, leaked documents examined by The New York Times offer a partial answer: Behind Mr. Milner\u2019s investments in Facebook and Twitter were hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kremlin.Obscured by a maze of offshore shell companies, the Twitter investment was backed by VTB, a Russian state-controlled bank often used for politically strategic deals.Ultimately, Mr. Milner\u2019s companies came to own more than 8 percent of Facebook and 5 percent of Twitter, helping earn him a place on various lists of the world\u2019s most powerful business people. His companies sold those holdings several years ago, but he retains investments in several other large technology companies and continues to make new deals. Among Mr. Milner\u2019s current investments is a real estate venture founded and partly owned by Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and White House adviser.Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites have become a major focus of federal investigations into Kremlin interference in the 2016 election. Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators are examining how Russians linked to the Kremlin turned the sites into garden hoses of bogus news stories and divisive political ads, and whether they coordinated with the Trump campaign.No one has suggested that Mr. Milner or his companies had any connection to the propaganda operation. For his part, Mr. Milner said in a pair of recent interviews that the Russian government money was no different from the financing he had received from his many other investors around the world.Even so, his use of the state-directed apparatus employed by so many Russian oligarchs to enrich themselves shows how the Kremlin has extended its long financial arm not only to his company but to some of America\u2019s technology giants.\u201cKremlin-connected institutions make investments with strategic interests in mind \u2014 not just commercial interests but state interests as well,\u201d said Michael Carpenter, the Russia director at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. \u201cThey go hand in hand.\u201dMr. Carpenter added, \u201cOligarchs who receive significant amounts of financial support from Russian banks like VTB or Sberbank or Gazprombank have to pass above a political threshold, meaning such support requires the explicit or tacit approval of those at the top of Russia\u2019s crony capitalist system.\u201dThere is nothing illegal about foreign state-owned institutions investing in American companies. VTB and Gazprom said the transactions were both sound investments, not motivated by political considerations.As Mr. Milner sees it, the story is similarly simple \u2014 \u201cnothing more than business,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe are getting money, and we are putting them in Facebook and Twitter. We are making money for our limited partners, and we are giving money back to them. For me, it\u2019s a commercial arrangement.\u201dMr. Milner, 55, studied theoretical physics at Moscow State University before moving to the United States, where he attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1990s and then worked for the World Bank in Washington.Mr. Milner eventually teamed with Alisher Usmanov \u2014 an Uzbek-Russian oligarch close to the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev \u2014 and a former Goldman Sachs executive to build a large stake in Mail.ru, a Russian internet company that now trades on the London Stock Exchange.Mr. Milner\u2019s initial American investments came as he served on an innovation commission set up in 2009 by Mr. Medvedev, who was Russia\u2019s president at the time and is something of a tech enthusiast, famously touring Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., with Steve Jobs.In May 2009, Facebook announced an investment of roughly $200 million by Mr. Milner\u2019s company, Digital Sky Technologies, and said the company planned to spend at least $100 million buying additional stock. Eventually, Mr. Milner\u2019s new venture capital firm, DST Global, also amassed a significant stake in Facebook.\u201cA number of firms approached us, but DST stood out because of the global perspective they bring,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said at the time.The documents reviewed by The Times reveal that DST brought something else as well: a connection \u2014 through a succession of shell companies \u2014 to the Kremlin.In those years, as part of its diplomatic \u201creset\u201d with Moscow, the Obama administration was encouraging Russia to learn from the American technology industry. Importing tech knowledge, the theory went, would ease Russia\u2019s dependence on exporting oil and gas.For the Facebook deal, it was Gazprom, the state-controlled natural-gas giant, that became the bridge. The company, a vital component of the Putin government, has employed its financial subsidiary, Gazprom Investholding, to reclaim assets privatized during the 1990s.Gazprom Investholding is \u201cused for politically important and strategically important deals for the Kremlin,\u201d said Ilya Zaslavskiy, a contributor to the Kleptocracy Initiative, a project of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. Both VTB and Gazprom Investholding\u2019s parent, Gazprom, are under United States sanctions stemming from Russia\u2019s support of separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.Kanton, based in the British Virgin Islands, had numerous ties to Mr. Milner\u2019s backer, Mr. Usmanov.Kanton was owned by a longtime Usmanov business associate, and was controlled by Matthias Bolliger, a director of numerous subsidiaries of Mr. Usmanov\u2019s main holding company, USM Holdings, according to an Appleby memo and the Panama Papers. And an email sent by a trust company on the Isle of Man used by Mr. Usmanov referred to Kanton as a \u201cprivate investment company, (facebook and twitter).\u201dIn the interviews, Mr. Milner said his investors\u2019 identities were not generally public information. And he sought to distance his company from Mr. Usmanov. \u201cI had no knowledge of him using state funds to invest with us,\u201d he said. What\u2019s more, he said, Mr. Usmanov had many potential sources of financing, making it impossible to know whether money from Gazprom Investholding was even used to finance his stake in Facebook.To demonstrate this, Mr. Milner set out a series of clear plastic cups with labels like \u201cAlleged Russian government funds,\u201d \u201cMr. Usmanov\u201d and \u201cFacebook.\u201d He pulled out a large bag of green M&M\u2019s, filled several cups and proceeded to shift the M&M\u2019s from one cup to another. \u201cMoney is fungible,\u201d he explained, adding, \u201cYou can\u2019t just say that this specific dollar went all the way to Facebook.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Usmanov, Rollo Head, did not address specific questions. But in a statement, he insisted that there are clear streams of money that do not mingle. Mr. Usmanov, he said, \u201cdid not borrow from or use state or quasi-state funds to make investments in Facebook.\u201dThe Facebook deal was a case study in the way Russia\u2019s oligarchs have mixed public and private roles for their own, and their government\u2019s, benefit: Even as he was investing in Facebook, Mr. Usmanov was general director of Gazprom Investholding.In fact, Mr. Usmanov had often intertwined his government position with his personal deals, according to a report by the global investigations and security firm Kroll. Kroll described those arrangements as \u201csynergies.\u201dThe Kroll report \u2014 a \u201creputation audit\u201d \u2014 had been commissioned by Mr. Usmanov as he set out to burnish his image a year before his deal with Mr. Milner to invest in Facebook. Kroll investigators, relying on public records and interviews, detailed a long and colorful history: time in prison in Uzbekistan (he was later exonerated) and past associations with alleged Russian organized crime figures, according to a draft copy of the report reviewed by The Times.The investigators also recounted a dizzying number of deals \u2014 involving mining, media and technology companies, often with the assistance of the Kremlin and Mr. Medvedev. \u201cUsmanov looks set to end the Putin era as the \u2018most improved\u2019 oligarch over the past eight years,\u201d one source told Kroll.Kroll investigators found that, for some investments, Mr. Usmanov turned to Kanton, the company that would be a part of Mr. Milner\u2019s Facebook investment.A Facebook spokeswoman, Vanessa Chan, declined to answer specific questions about the deal with DST, calling it a \u201cpassive investor\u201d and noting that the company had invested and cashed out several years ago.Gazprom Investholding called the loans \u201cprudent,\u201d saying they were \u201cprovided for general corporate purposes\u201d at above-market rates. The company did not answer a question about what role, if any, Mr. Usmanov played in the loans, except to say that as its general director, he \u201coperated in accordance\u201d with the company\u2019s charter.To complete the Facebook deal, DST used a pair of lawyers based in Cyprus and Britain who have also set up offshore entities for Russian oligarchs close to Mr. Putin, according to the Panama Papers, United States securities filings and records from Appleby. DST did not answer questions about how it came to use the two lawyers.After the Facebook deal, Mr. Milner became a fixture in Silicon Valley, spending about $100 million on a 25,000-square-foot house in Los Altos Hills and investing $7 billion in more than 30 companies, including Spotify, Airbnb and Groupon.In interviews, he has referred to his close relationship to management at the companies in which he invests. Mr. Milner and Mr. Zuckerberg became friends and met monthly. Still, despite his company\u2019s sizable stake, Mr. Milner did not take a board seat or voting rights.At the 2010 technology conference in San Francisco, Mr. Milner was asked if he provided management with advice along with his cash. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually the opposite,\u201d he replied. \u201cI sometimes get informal advice from them.\u201dMr. Milner\u2019s roughly $380 million investment in Twitter was directly backed by another instrument of Kremlin power: Russia\u2019s second-largest bank, VTB.Sixty-one percent of the bank is owned by the Russian government. VTB\u2019s president, Andrey L. Kostin, is a former Soviet diplomat; Matthias Warnig, on the bank\u2019s supervisory council, is a former East German spy who served in Dresden while Mr. Putin was stationed there with the K.G.B.Last year, the Panama Papers revealed that a Cyprus bank owned by VTB was used to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to accounts connected to Sergei Roldugin, a cellist and close friend of Mr. Putin. It was unknown what the money was for, but some speculated that he was working as a frontman for Kremlin insiders.Mr. Roldugin did not respond to messages for this article, but said at the time that his wealth came through donations from rich businessmen for the purchase of musical instruments. VTB called the account in the Panama Papers \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d\u201cVTB is really a slush fund for Putin,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, and an early economic adviser to the post-Soviet Russian government. The bank, he added, is \u201cthe black cashier of the Putin crowd.\u201dMr. Milner\u2019s Twitter deal is a complex web of share transfers and offshore financial entities. But its details may offer clues that there was a strategic motive behind VTB\u2019s involvement.In July 2011, VTB invested at least $191 million in exchange for shares of an Isle of Man company called DST Investments 3, corporate records show. That offshore vehicle was used to buy roughly half of DST Global\u2019s stake in Twitter that month. DST Investments 3 also issued shares to Kanton, the company linked to Mr. Usmanov that was at the center of the Facebook deal.The Twitter deal had a notable feature: VTB put virtually all of the cash into DST Investments 3, filings show. Kanton contributed almost none. It is highly unusual for investors in DST funds to get stakes without contributing cash, according to a person familiar with the matter.On May 7, 2014 \u2014 six months after Twitter\u2019s initial public offering, when insiders were first permitted to sell their shares \u2014 VTB transferred the bulk of its stake in DST Investments 3 to Kanton. DST also cashed out its Twitter investment.DST had one other investment from VTB, which Mr. Milner compared to a sovereign wealth fund. VTB was an investor in the Chinese internet company JD.com as recently as February 2015, when it transferred its stake to Kanton, Isle of Man records show.In a statement, VTB said its involvement with Twitter was \u201csolely a financial investment,\u201d sold for a profit, one of several successful deals in the high-tech industry in that period. The bank added, \u201cVTB is a solely commercial bank, we have never had any politically motivated deals.\u201dTwitter declined to answer a series of questions about VTB, but said that as a matter of policy it had done reviews of all pre-I.P.O. investors.Mr. Milner would not discuss how VTB came to be an investor, other than to say that the bank helped take Mail.ru public in 2010. According to the Kroll report, the Kremlin had previously ordered VTB to finance other ventures of Mr. Usmanov. The report also details the close relationship between Mr. Usmanov and Mr. Medvedev, finding that Mr. Medvedev helped him win a bid for a lucrative copper ore deposit in Siberia.Mr. Milner said he invested $850,000 in Cadre through a trust, which in turn controls DST Global Advisers, DST Global\u2019s investment management firm. He said he was introduced to the company through an early investor whose name he did not remember. He said he met Jared Kushner only once, at a conference in Aspen, Colo.Mr. Kushner and Cadre declined to comment.In his interviews with The Times, Mr. Milner shied away from the controversy now enveloping Facebook and Twitter, his former major investments.Growing up in the Soviet Union, he said, \u201cif you\u2019re a father and you have a conversation with your son, it\u2019s easy to say, \u2018Please don\u2019t get involved in politics.\u2019\u201dThat \u201cwas my principle back then and still now,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI prefer just to focus on business and philanthropy. And this is plenty for me.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a Facebook spokeswoman. She is Vanessa Chan, not Chen.Katie Benner, Conor Dougherty and Andrew E.

{"Headline": "Same Vegetables, New Flavors", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenHow traditional do you want your Thanksgiving meal to be? It\u2019s a good question to ask when planning a menu. The original New World Thanksgiving dinner \u2014 a several-days-long feast \u2014 was lavish, but it is likely that green vegetables were not abundant.Gourds, melons, pumpkins and squashes were the vegetables of choice, or carrots and parsnips grown from seed brought by the settlers. Dried native corn was ground, and either baked into cakes or cooked for porridge. Berries and other wild fruits such as plums, gooseberries and grapes were much appreciated.But mostly there was game to eat, and plenty of it. Wild turkeys and pheasants, ducks, geese and swans were spit-roasted, as was a vast supply of venison. Cod and lobster were plentiful. Shellfish was abundant, too; huge coastal beds were stacked with oysters, clams and mussels, just waiting to be plucked.I get it. Nostalgia makes us, myself included, crave these dull and mellow accompaniments. Even so, I\u2019m usually inclined to tinker just a little. I monkey around with the bird\u2019s seasoning, and, for the vegetables, I want some bright flavors and colors to contrast with the generally monochromatic basics. I always turn my cranberries into spicy chutney, for instance. This year, I\u2019m playing with basic vegetables like carrots, cauliflower and brussels sprouts.A dozen tools reviewed by Wirecutter to improve your Thanksgiving feast.Mashed carrots may bring baby food to mind, or a fancy French pur\u00e9e, but these \u201csmashed\u201d ones are something else, and they have texture. Add the salty tang of feta cheese and lots of chopped fresh mint, and the carrots\u2019 sweetness becomes a playful partner in a new scheme. Throw a little garlic at them, and a hint of crushed red pepper.Cauliflower can be boiled, baked or roasted, and seasoned in any number of ways. Going sweet and sour is a good option for Thanksgiving \u2014 I like the contrast of big Italianate agrodolce flavors. Raisins, currants, wine, sugar and vinegar, along with onions and sweet spices, transport cauliflower to elegance. I make this a day or two ahead, as it only improves as it steeps. Served hot or cold, the cauliflower becomes a sort of condiment as well as a side dish.Though they look like tiny cabbages, brussels sprouts don\u2019t have the same demeanor as cabbage. They manage somehow to be both bland and overpowering with their imposing personality. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I\u2019m a fan. Sprouts simply require a more aggressive approach than steaming or even roasting. They pair well with cured pork, like bacon, so I figured why not chorizo? Spanish chorizo has loads of flavor, but, for good measure, I added a little smoky push from piment\u00f3n and a hit of chopped garlic, which made the vegetable especially fetching.New traditions must begin somewhere. To please your guests this year, try one of these jazzed-up vegetables. If you prefer to stick with family favorites, save them for another Thanksgiving Day \u2014 or any day.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Panettone Has Become an Obsession for American Bakers", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo make panettone \u2014 traditional panettone, coaxed from a stiff, naturally leavened starter \u2014 is to embark on a long, expensive and unpredictable journey, risking disaster at every turn.Roy Shvartzapel, a baker in San Francisco, refers to the Italian bread as \u201cthe Mount Everest of baking.\u201dPanettone dough is wildly sensitive, demanding and occasionally infuriating, following its own unique logic and schedule. Built up in stages, it can\u2019t be rushed or made to wait. It requires an investment of ingredients, a deep understanding of fermentation and attention to pH levels, along with constant attention.Give it all that, and a panettone can still go wrong. Bakers from Los Gatos, Calif., to Pittsburgh say that\u2019s exactly why they\u2019re so obsessed with the high-maintenance dough: No bread is more difficult, or more rewarding, to get right.A great panettone can be pulled apart with almost no effort into so many long, diaphanous strands that dissolve on the tongue. It is sweet, but not intensely so: more weightless than cake, with the softest, roundest, most delicate tang of sourdough. Stored properly, it will keep that way for a month.Jim Lahey started selling panettone at Sullivan Street Bakery, in New York, in 1996. This year\u2019s batch is full of rum-plumped raisins and candied citron, or dark chocolate and dried sour cherries. \u201cPanettone is this high art for the world of bread,\u201d said Mr. Lahey, \u201cbecause there\u2019s an enormous amount of technique in making it.\u201dHe includes a recipe for it in his book, \u201cThe Sullivan Street Bakery Cookbook,\u201d written with Maya Joseph. Adapted for the home baker, the recipe includes less sugar than the version sold at the bakery, which means it doesn\u2019t require a complex panettone-specific starter. \u201cIf made correctly, if all the conditions are correct post-baking, I once had a panettone last eight months without molding or spoilage,\u201d Mr. Lahey said.To make it, Mr. Easton buys butter from Normandy, or prepares his own cultured butter, and tracks down organic wine grapes to make his own raisins. He has cared for his lievito madre, the Italian-style starter he uses to make the bread, for several years.Most of Mr. Easton\u2019s panettone will be jeweled with citrus peel and homemade raisins, but a few will be more experimental, shot through with pieces of candied pumpkin, or candied quince and almonds.\u201cHere is this thing that\u2019s incredibly rich, decadent, indulgent, but it\u2019s impossibly light,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the greatest thing about a panettone, the thing you\u2019re reaching for as a baker: that texture.\u201d\u201cThe industrialization of bread-making made panettone available to a much broader spectrum of the population,\u201d Mr. Easton said. It fundamentally changed the bread, too.The same boxed, mass-produced versions that made panettone famous, and that took it from being a rare luxury item to one anyone could buy, gave it a reputation as nothing more than a parched, heavily perfumed sponge.Mr. Shvartzapel thought of panettone that way until about a decade ago, when he tasted one made in the artisanal Italian tradition, in Paris. \u201cIt had this melting, cotton-candy type quality,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was a texture I\u2019d never experienced in a baked good before.\u201dMr. Shvartzapel later learned how to achieve that flossy quality from the Italian baker Iginio Massari, outside Milan.Mr. Shvartzapel began by making small batches of panettone, sometimes using other people\u2019s kitchens, wrapping up the loaves at his apartment in Healdsburg, Calif., and loading them into the trunk of his car to sell locally. Back then, Mr. Shvartzapel was still testing his theory that Americans would pay $50 for his panettone. (They would.)\u201cOutside of the United States, panettone is a multibillion-dollar market,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy not here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Italy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I learned on my feet.\u201dThis year, baking it for the first time, Ms. Ruzicka studied recipes and referenced the photos that bakers shared on Instagram of their unctuous, seething doughs. She sent Mr. Shvartzapel, a friend, the occasional message to help troubleshoot.\u201cIf you mess up a panettone, it\u2019s gone,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t save it. It just all goes in the garbage.\u201d And Ms. Ruzicka found, as all bakers do, that there is a near-infinite number of ways to mess it up.Ms. Ruzicka once used butter that was a couple of degrees too warm, and the dough turned to mush. She pulled a panettone out of the oven a few minutes early, and it slipped right out of its mold, deflating. One time, just a smidgen over-fermented, a whole batch collapsed because the yeast had grown too acidic.\u201cBread-making is always mystical and exciting, but panettone more so than anything else,\u201d she said.With some practice, Ms. Ruzicka got it just right: Proofed almost to its breaking point, emulsified with an exorbitant amount of fat, the wet, shiny, comically stretchy dough vaulted up into glorious golden domes, as it had done for so many bakers before her, creating a magnificent structure that would reveal itself after the bread was cooled, upside down, to preserve its fragile, chaotic matrix of bubbles.\u201cIt melts in your mouth and it\u2019s suddenly gone,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then you want to eat more.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret to Long Life? It May Lurk in the DNA of the Oldest Among Us", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut even as they indulged the notion that exceptionally healthy longevity can be explained by lifestyle, each agreed to donate DNA to a private effort to find the secrets in supercentenarian genes.The rare cache of supercentenarian genomes, the largest yet to be sequenced and made public, comes as studies of garden-variety longevity have yielded few solid clues to healthy aging. Lifestyle and luck, it seems, still factor heavily into why people live into their 90s and 100s.The New England Centenarian Study, one of a handful of longevity research groups around the world focusing on supercentenarians, now turns down prospective DNA donors under age 103: \u201cWe tell them they\u2019re too young,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Perls, the study\u2019s director.A professed citizen-scientist, Mr. Clement collected blood, skin or saliva from supercentenarians in 14 states and seven countries over a six-year period. Many were still gardening, arguing, driving and flirting. Ms. Michelson, for one, was fond of reading and reciting Shakespeare.Complex traits like height, body mass index and disease risk \u2014 phenotypes, as they are known in genetics-speak \u2014 typically arise from a combination of hundreds of places in the genome where the DNA alphabet differs between individuals.\u201cThis is what we call an \u2018extreme phenotype,\u2019 \u201d said Dr. Church, who ultimately arranged for the genomes to be sequenced so that Mr. Clement could release them through a nonprofit. \u201cThe farther out you go on the bell curve, the more likely you are to find something, even with a small sample size.\u201dAn account of what Mr. Clement calls the Supercentenarian Research Project offers a glimpse at what that might entail, including perseverance, compassion and a sense of humor that trends toward dark.It was an inauspicious start, Mr. Clement admitted in an email to a friend in January 2011. The first supercentenarian Mr. Clement had lined up to visit, Mississippi Winn, had died at 113 before he could get from his home in San Jose, Calif., to hers in Shreveport, La.Once that milestone is reached, as Mr. Clement quickly learned, the chance of dying within the next year is roughly 50 percent. After 113, the odds are closer to 66 percent. The oldest person on record, Jeanne Calment, was 122 when she died in 1997; only one other person is known to have lived beyond age 118.\u201cEven while you\u2019re packing the car, the person may fall ill and say they\u2019re not up to it,\u201d Mr. Clement said, after the first of several plans for me to observe a DNA donation was abruptly canceled.Mr. Clement could extract DNA from post-mortem samples, with permission from the family and assuming he could reach the funeral home in time. Exhumation is also possible, in theory, to obtain samples.But for understandable reasons, he said, family members most often ended communications with him at the time of a supercentenarian\u2019s death. To improve the odds of getting samples \u2014 and the gender balance, since supercentenarians are nearly all women \u2014 he lowered his target age from 110 to 106.\u201cIt\u2019s better to get there when they\u2019re alive,\u201d he said.He created Google alerts for the phrases \u201c109th birthday,\u201d \u201c110th birthday,\u201d and \u201c111th birthday,\u201d and for the obituaries of known supercentenarians.There was, nominally, the prospect of making money.But with a business plan that, even to some of his investors, sounded more like a research project, Mr. Clement seems to have undertaken the task largely because it provided the chance to act on a longstanding interest in human longevity, including his own.He harbors what he prefers to call a \u201chealthy love of life,\u201d rather than an aversion to death, and he is possessed of an apparently genuine conviction that longer lives would make humans more humane.\u201cMy hat was off to someone who was willing to take the time out of his life to go get these precious specimens,\u201d said Dr. Church, the Harvard geneticist, who has devoted a portion of his laboratory to research into the reversal of aging.The kind of ultrarare mutations that supercentenarians might harbor, Dr. Church believed, were not likely to be detected with standard techniques, which scan only the places in the genome where DNA is already known to vary between individuals.To look for as-yet-uncataloged variations would require sequencing all of the supercentenarians\u2019 six billion genetic letters, a far more expensive procedure. When he and Mr. Clement first discussed the idea in 2010, the cost was about $50,000 per genome.Mr. Sisnett, who grew his own food until he was 105, was \u201cstill fascinated by seeing a nice-looking backside\u201d when he was in his 110s, his daughter, Everine Carter, 88, recalled in a telephone interview.The best time to get DNA from a supercentenarian, Mr. Clement found, is midmorning. By lunchtime, they would prefer to be eating. After lunch, they might be groggy or napping.Most, like Dorothy Peel of London, then 108, had sharp minds. Ms. Peel inspected the informed consent form through her reading glasses and peppered him with questions about other supercentenarians he had met.Crisscrossing Europe in 2011, Mr. Clement hit his collecting stride. But there were some bumps.He had ordered an inexpensive kit that allowed him to prick a supercentenarian\u2019s finger and deposit a drop of blood on a card to preserve it, often used by geneticists in the field.Not until he had switched to hiring a phlebotomist to perform blood draws with a needle did he learn that the cards with the original 15 samples were defective. \u201cWe could not detect any DNA,\u201d read a 2011 email from the laboratory.Mr. Clement confessed the news to Dr. Church in a meeting at his Harvard office. \u201cYou didn\u2019t test the cards?\u201d the geneticist asked him gently.Still, Mr. Clement had 23 good samples in hand, and the cost of sequencing by this time had fallen to some $15,000 per genome. With his remaining funds, he sequenced 15, leaving the rest in cold storage.Mr. Clement quickly discovered 2,500 differences between the supercentenarian DNA and those of controls. But even with help from graduate students in Dr. Church\u2019s lab, it was hard with such a small group to know which, if any, were significant.So over the next few years, Mr. Clement, working without a salary, collected samples whenever he could, adding another dozen from supercentenarians across the United States.In July 2016, I was invited to accompany Mr. Clement to Mr. Matthews\u2019s home in California. As much as I looked forward to meeting my first supercentenarian, I was not prepared to envy his win in the genetic longevity lottery.The prospect of shifting today\u2019s average life span to that of the known limit of all humanity is disorienting. An average life expectancy of 80 in some ways seems generous \u2014 it was just 48 when Mr. Matthews was born in 1906. Most of us expect around 80 years on the planet, assuming nothing horrendous happens.\u201cWhen you have children the first time, it don\u2019t come with a manual, and it don\u2019t come with a manual when your dad gets to be 100, then 105, then 110,\u201d said Mr. Matthews\u2019s son, Steve, 75, who also gave blood the day we visited.But Mr. Matthews asserted without hesitation that he still enjoyed life. Pleasures included his lunchtime smoothie, his family, the kindness of his caregiver, and \u2014 this with a nod to a New York Times photographer and a rakish grin \u2014 \u201chaving my picture taken.\u201dHe reminisced fondly about his second wife, Katherine, who died in 1980 and with whom he had loved to dance.At 110, he said he had never been diagnosed with a serious illness. The younger Mr. Matthews recalled that his father had played a one-under-par, 18-hole golf game on his 99th birthday. Having built a successful real estate business, he provided financial support to his last surviving sibling, a sister who was 105.Talking to him, it was hard not to fantasize about the possibility that, as another Facebook participant suggested, \u201cby the time we get to that age, we may all be living to 110.\u201dAt the time the oldest man in America, Mr. Matthews sometimes strained to hear, but his sense of humor and perspective were intact. If that was what we wanted, he advised, \u201cKeep breathing.\u201dTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTWhether, in combination with the genomes of his fellow supercentenarians, the rest contains the secret to a long, healthy and happy life remains to be seen.An earlier version of this article misstated the Massachusetts town in which Goldie Michelson resided.

{"Headline": "Encountering Robots While Still Using Fax Machines in Japan", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Motoko Rich, The Times\u2019s Tokyo bureau chief, discussed the tech she's using.  What kind of tech tools do you use to cover news in Japan? I also have a much smaller battery that I can use to juice up my phone when it starts to die from too much live tweeting, but the XXL comes in handy if I actually have to report and write a whole story away from the office or my home or a hotel room. In such a situation, I will use either a portable Wi-Fi or the personal hot spot on my cellphone to get online.Twitter is very popular in Japan, so if we want to get a sense of the mood about a particular breaking news story \u2014 much as we do in the United States \u2014 my researchers will scan Twitter or Facebook to get a sense of how people are reacting to news. Occasionally a tweet can be the seed of a feature story.Earthquake apps like QuakeFeed are also helpful in quake-prone Japan, not to mention as early indicators of nuclear tests in North Korea.Since I make a lot of calls to analysts and government officials in the United States either very early in the morning or late at night (Tokyo is 13 hours ahead of New York and Washington), I try to use WhatsApp or Skype to call people abroad since my Japanese cell plan charges extra for overseas calls. My small beef with the academics who specialize in Japan and the Korean Peninsula is that so many of them seem incapable or unwilling to use internet-based calling apps.What interesting tech trends do you see emerging in Japan that haven't yet reached the United States? For personal texting, Line, a communications app that started after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, is extremely popular. So I communicate with friends, my staff and even the woman who cuts my hair using Line. Part of the reason it's so popular here is its wide variety of emoticons and digital stickers.How do you use tech differently in Japan than you did in the United States? My 11-year-old son has a small \u201ckeitai,\u201d or kids\u2019 cellphone, that is programmed so he can only call or receive calls from me, my husband or his sister. By the time we left Brooklyn in 2016, it seemed like most kids his age either didn't have a phone at all, or had a smartphone. A lot of Japanese children, as young as age 6, have such keitais, which enable them to independently travel on subways and walk to and from school on their own while still being reachable. We often run into very small children on their own on the subway platform, the small phones dangling from their backpacks.Mobile payment systems have been slow to gain traction in America. How about in Japan? Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life? FaceTime, Skype and WhatsApp are lifelines for staying in touch with friends and family back home. My 13-year-old daughter regularly talks to her best friends in Brooklyn and in England on FaceTime, and the other day I Skyped into a meeting of my Brooklyn book group.I really only began posting regularly to Instagram once I moved to Japan, because I want everyone at home to be able to see what I\u2019m seeing every day, here and in South Korea, where I travel regularly to report. Japan and Korea are visually sumptuous places, and, yes, I am one of those clich\u00e9d people who post photos of their lunches.My daughter is obsessed with Snapchat and streaks, an activity whose point I have yet to grasp. But I have been surprised by the number of times she'll tell me that she has seen some news item on Instagram or Snapchat, an activity whose point I wholeheartedly endorse.The robotics industry is important to Japan. Meanwhile, personal digital assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are trendy in the United States. Where do you think this is all taking us?Unlike in the United States, where workers fear automation taking over their jobs, robotics are embraced here in Japan by the government, corporate sector and broader society. The government is anti-immigration, so one of its oft-cited solutions to a declining population and shrinking labor force is to rely increasingly on artificial intelligence.Whether robots can actually accomplish all the tasks they are being promoted for is an open question. I wonder whether something as personal as nursing home care can really be outsourced to robots. As a parent, I would hate the thought that robots would be used in day care facilities, unless it was just for food preparation or cleanup.Advertisement"}

But he said he has not, to the best of his recollection, had conversations with people inside the administration about the deal.To a question \u2014 posed by a CNN reporter in the crowd \u2014 about whether the pall over the deal can be attributed in part to a \u201cTrump factor,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said no.If completed, the acquisition of Time Warner \u2014 the owner of HBO, Warner Bros. and CNN \u2014 would transform AT&T into a colossus capable of both producing content and distributing it to millions of people via its wireless and satellite services.But on Wednesday, negotiations between the companies and the Justice Department appeared to be mired in politics.Accounts of AT&T\u2019s meeting with antitrust officials on Monday \u2014 which Mr. Stephenson said was \u201cvery productive\u201d \u2014 have differed. In one, Justice Department officials called on the company to sell Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN, or DirecTV \u2014 the satellite television provider that AT&T purchased two years ago for nearly $49 billion \u2014 for the Time Warner deal to proceed.Another version involved Mr. Stephenson\u2019s offering to sell the news channel. Mr. Stephenson on Wednesday and again on Thursday denied making such an overture.\u201cThis is a classic vertical merger,\u201d Mr. Stephenson told The Times\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin. \u201cThere are no overlaps of competition. There are no competitors being taken out of the competition. There hasn\u2019t been one of these challenged in the courts and defeated in 40 years.\u201dThe deal is designed to help AT&T counter slowing growth in its core wireless, internet and satellite businesses while fending off online video upstarts like Netflix and Hulu.\u201cThe idea that somehow we\u2019re going to take distribution and content and create something so powerful that it would disrupt Google, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix, it\u2019s comical to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying build a platform that allows us to compete with those guys.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the AT&T-Time Warner Merger Makes Sense", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCombining AT&T, which distributes digital content over its wireless networks, with a news and entertainment provider like Time Warner is what economists and antitrust experts consider a classic vertical merger. Because the companies don\u2019t compete, their combining would not alter the competitive landscape in either the telecommunications or entertainment industries.For more than 40 years, through Republican and Democratic administrations, the courts have not blocked a vertical integration like this one.Typically more problematic for the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division are horizontal mergers, where two competitors in the same industry seek to combine. But this past summer the Trump administration waved through the horizontal merger of the giant retailer Amazon, already active in food sales, with a leading upscale grocer, Whole Foods. To now block a vertical integration of AT&T and Time Warner would indicate an inexcusably scattershot approach to antitrust decisions that would create enormous uncertainties for the broader business community and shake public confidence in the rule of law that underpins our democracy.Businesses seek to integrate vertically because such mergers tend to create efficiencies and synergies \u2014 benefiting both companies without posing major risks to their competitors or, more crucially, to consumers. With all the options available to consumers for receiving video programming these days \u2014 including cable, satellite, internet broadband and smartphones \u2014 the market is vibrantly, almost chaotically, competitive and innovative. When viewed in light of this creative turmoil, the AT&T-Time Warner transaction does not pose a competitive threat. If anything, it would create an attractive set of new options for the viewing public.To appreciate the dynamism of the video and television space, consider that Apple, a relatively new entrant, recently ordered two full seasons of Reese Witherspoon\u2019s latest television show without so much as seeing a pilot. It underscored the competitive new dynamics of the marketplace: Companies are throwing around cash like never before to attract viewers already happily distracted by an array of programming and viewing alternatives in this new golden age of television.Rather than Time Warner holding anything resembling a dominant position in the entertainment industry, it finds itself competing with emerging video powerhouses like Netflix and Amazon. And consumers are increasingly cutting the cable because they have numerous, often cheaper streaming options for getting content they want.How do we know? One need only look at perhaps the closest comparison to the AT&T-Time Warner merger \u2014 the marriage of the nation\u2019s largest cable and internet broadband provider, Comcast, to NBC Universal, which the Justice Department blessed in 2011. Despite the arguments of opponents at the time, there has been no negative impact to consumers or competitors. Quite the opposite \u2014 the competitive and creative forces that continue to change the industry have only accelerated since the Comcast-NBC merger.If the Justice Department cannot cite persuasive antitrust grounds for blocking the AT&T-Time Warner merger, the public will be left wondering whether political motives were involved or that the department\u2019s thinking was muddied by vague opposition to media consolidation. Neither of those reasons would likely stand up in federal court.By any objective analysis, the real power in the information industry these days is not in the wireless or entertainment industries. It is in companies like Google and Facebook, which possess the power to influence our national elections and redefine basic human interactions. In this brave new digital world, blocking the merger of AT&T and Time Warner would only undermine public confidence in the ability of antitrust enforcers to recognize reality.Instead, the Justice Department should approve the merger and get to work policing the real threats to competition and consumer welfare.Michael J.

{"Headline": "Soothsayer in the Hills Sees Silicon Valley\u2019s Sinister Side", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith ... Jaron LanierBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 Jaron Lanier is the most unusual person I\u2019ve ever met.And I\u2019ve met a lot of unusual people.\u201cI\u2019m a professional illusionist,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways, I might know more about making illusions than anybody.\u201dMr. Lanier is one of the few prophets who admits that the spawn of Silicon Valley could become evil, but he tries to stay on the sunny side. It helps that he avoids all social media.\u201cThe popular ones are designed for behavior modification,\u201d he says, wearing his usual black T-shirt and black pants. \u201cIt\u2019s like, why would you go sign up for an evil hypnotist who\u2019s explicitly saying that his whole purpose is to get you to do things that people have paid him to get you to do, but he won\u2019t tell you who they are?\u201dAt this moment when dark clouds loom over Silicon Valley, Mr. Lanier is able to talk about the Lords of the Cloud with affection yet candor, as he worries that these tech gods creating new worlds may be getting \u201chigh on their own supply.\u201d\u201cThis is such a scary time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says, in his sweet, breathy voice. \u201cI mean, it is for me. I had always feared we would create this social-manipulation technology out of computers.\u201dIn his forthcoming memoir, \u201cDawn of the New Everything: Encounters With Reality and Virtual Reality,\u201d the Microsoft wizard enthuses that VR \u201cweds the nerdy thing with the hippie mystic thing,\u201d high-tech but like a dream and \u201can elixir of unbounded experience.\u201dBut he\u2019s well aware of the \u201cMatrix\u201d dangers. He realized early on, he writes, that \u201cit could turn out to be the evilest invention of all time.\u201dIt\u2019s a pretty simple proposition, he tells me: \u201cIf you control the person\u2019s reality, you control the person.\u201d Or as he writes in the book, \u201cNever has a medium been so potent for beauty and so vulnerable to creepiness.\u201dRecently, the creepiness has been on display.Mark Zuckerberg stumbled into more trouble for tone-deafness when he used his cartoon avatar to take a disaster adventure trip, a \u201cmagical\u201d 360-degree virtual reality tour of hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico to promote his new Facebook Spaces app.\u201cOh, God,\u201d Mr. Lanier said when he saw it. \u201cIt is scary and awful how out of touch Silicon Valley people have become.\u201dThe story also noted that, given how lifelike the technology is, \u201ccertainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual reality sex constitutes cheating.\u201dMr. Lanier, who discourses eloquently on subjects like limerence and lust in his book, says: \u201cThe future I\u2019d prefer to see is one where people use VR together to make really crazy imaginative experiences that might be sexual or might not. Where you turn into fantastical creatures and that sort of thing. Or when your bodies merge in some ways. That to me is so much more interesting than the porn. Porn is a product of the cinema era. It\u2019s an old-fashioned way of thinking, locked in the 19th century.\u201dMore and more, we are wondering why, when we know the top Silicon Valley companies are not benevolent, we invite them into the most intimate areas of our lives, as Scott Galloway asks in \u201cThe Four,\u201d a book about how Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are refashioning the world. \u201cAre these entities the Four Horsemen of god, love, sex, and consumption?\u201d Mr. Galloway wonders. \u201cOr are they the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse?\u201dEven though he\u2019s prone to whimsical, esoteric tangents, I know I can get a straight answer on that from Mr. Lanier.We sit down at his dining room table amid a wild cornucopia of stuff, including a lamp with a hot pink feathered shade and black cats lounging on chairs and hanging, Cirque du Soleil-style, from carpeted staircases. There are also musical instruments \u2014 a golden Wurlitzer pedal harp; a rare pre-Depression Mason & Hamlin piano that Mr. Lanier says has \u201ca uniquely American sound,\u201d a 19th-century Chinese opium bed filled with saxophones, flutes, clarinets, lutes and ouds; mandolins covering the walls, and over a thousand more instruments, from a medieval cornetto to a shakuhachi, a Japanese flute \u2014 all of which Mr. Lanier can play.Like his house, his new book is crammed full of strange and mesmerizing stuff.Right after he was born, his mother, a Marlene Dietrich look-alike and Viennese pianist and stock trader who had talked her way out of a concentration camp by passing as Aryan, and his father, whose family had been mostly wiped out in Ukrainian pogroms, took Jaron someplace they thought would be safe: the westernmost corner of Texas. There, he had to confront more than his share of bullies growing up, once by swinging a baritone horn at them.His mother died when he was about 9, when her car flipped over on the freeway as she was coming back from getting her driver\u2019s license. His father, who worked for a time as the science editor of \u201cAmazing,\u201d \u201cFantastic\u201d and \u201cAstounding\u201d pulp science-fiction magazines, then let his 11-year-old son design their new house in New Mexico: a geodesic dome.The design, Mr. Lanier writes, looked \u201ca little like a woman\u2019s body. You could see the big dome as a pregnant belly and the two icosahedrons as breasts.\u201dHe tosses out that his father may have been the one to start the rumor about alligators in the sewers of New York.After a takeout chicken and macaroni dinner, Mr. Lanier bids a loving good night to his wife, Lena, a child psychologist, and their 11-year old daughter, Lilibell. Then he brings out his Microsoft HoloLens headsets and a big mug of chocolate milk. \u201cI\u2019m more like the child than the parent, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he says.I spend some time wearing the headset painting graffiti in the air with my hand, and Mr. Lanier explains why the brain can see more than the eyes.\u201cExpect some smelly feet,\u201d Mr. Lanier says.Unlike many here, he does not think of humans as ants in his experiments.\u201cHopefully, in this period, when we\u2019re dealing with this really crude and early stuff like Facebook feeds, Instagram, Snapchat,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019ll be able to get the politics straight and find a path for people to have dignity and autonomy before the hard-core stuff comes. Unless we all kill ourselves through this other stuff, which is a possibility, too. One of the great joys of the Trump era is having your 11-year-old say, \u2018The former head of NATO said there\u2019s a one in 10 chance of nuclear war. Is that right?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, great. Thank you, Trump. That\u2019s very nice.\u2019\u201dMr. Lanier believes that Facebook and Google, with their \u201ctop-down control schemes,\u201d should be called \u201cBehavior Modification Empires.\u201d\u201cThe whole internet thing was supposed to create the world\u2019s best information resource in all of history,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything would be made visible. And instead we\u2019re living in this time of total opacity where you don\u2019t know why you see the news you see. You don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same news that someone else sees. You don\u2019t know who made it be that way. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s paid to change what you see. Everything is totally obscure in a profound way that it never was before.\u201cAnd the belief system of Silicon Valley is so thick that my friends at Facebook simply still really believe that the answer to any problem is to do more of what they already did, that they\u2019re optimizing the world.\u201cThe Facebook business model is mass behavior modification for pay. And for those who are not giving Facebook money, the only \u2014 and I want to emphasize, the only, underlined and in bold and italics \u2014 reward they can get or positive feedback is just getting attention. And if you have a system where the only possible prize is getting more attention, then you call that system Christmas for Asses, right? It\u2019s a creep-amplification device.\u201cOnce Facebook becomes ubiquitous, it\u2019s a sort of giant protection racket, where, if you don\u2019t pay them money, then someone else will pay to modify the behavior to your disadvantage, so everyone has to pay money just to stay at equilibrium where they would have been otherwise,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s only one way out for Facebook, which is to change its business model. Unless Facebook changes, we\u2019ll just have to trust Facebook for any future election result. Because they do apparently have the ability to change them. Or at least change the close ones.\u201dWhy would Facebook change its business model when it\u2019s raking in billions?\u201cI would appeal to the decency of the people in it,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd if not to them, then the toughness of the regulators. It\u2019s going to be one of the struggles of the century.\u201dI point out that after the stunning Trump win, President Obama took Mr. Zuckerberg aside and warned him to take the threat of political disinformation seriously, but the young billionaire dismissed the idea that it was widespread.\u201cWell, no one in Silicon Valley believes that anybody knows more than us,\u201d Mr. Lanier says dryly. \u201cSurely not the government.\u201dHe continues: \u201cI think there are a lot of good people at Facebook, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re evil as individuals. Or at least not the ones that I\u2019ve met. And I know Google a lot better, and I feel pretty certain that they\u2019re not evil. But both of these companies have this behavior-manipulation business plan, which is just not something the world can sustain at that scale. It just makes everything crazy.\u201dI remark that Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg expressed surprise that their fiendish little invention could do something so nefarious.\u201cPeople in the community knew,\u201d Mr. Lanier says, adding that he wrote essays and participated in debates in the early 1990s about how easy it would be the create unreality and manipulate society, how you could put out a feed of information that would put people in illusory worlds where they thought they had sought out the information but actually they had been guided \u201cthe way a magician forces a card.\u201d\u201cSo for somebody to say they didn\u2019t know the algorithms could do that,\u201d Mr. Lanier says in a disbelieving tone. \u201cIf somebody didn\u2019t know, they should\u2019ve known.\u201dSo what happens when fake news marries virtual reality?\u201cIt could be much more significant,\u201d Mr. Lanier says. \u201cWhen you look at all the ways of manipulating people that you can do with just a crude thing like a Facebook feed \u2014 when people are just looking at images and text on their phones and they\u2019re not really inside synthetic worlds yet \u2014 when you can do it with virtual reality, it\u2019s like total control of the person. So what I\u2019m hoping is that we\u2019re going to figure this stuff out so we don\u2019t make ourselves insane before virtual reality becomes mature.\u201dHe says that Silicon Valley has turned out both better and worse than he expected: \u201cAs far as the worse part, creating a global behavior-modification empire is worse than I thought. And creating a world that\u2019s more opaque instead of less opaque is worse than I thought we should do. It\u2019s also a physically uglier place than I thought it would be. It\u2019s really a shame. If we\u2019re the new Renaissance, why don\u2019t we make this amazing Tuscany here? We have these gorgeous orchards. Why don\u2019t we do something beautiful here instead of just filling it up with parking lots and horrible buildings?\u201dHe says sometimes his peers in the Valley seem perfectly nice but then they will say something \u201cI just can\u2019t believe.\u201d He cites Eric Schmidt\u2019s comment on privacy on CNBC\u2019s \u201cInside the Mind of Google\u201d special in 2009, that \u201cIf you have something that you don\u2019t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Mr. Lanier asks. \u201cIt does give me this feeling sometimes that something\u2019s going wrong with our culture in Silicon Valley and maybe it\u2019s just that thing of power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely, just losing perspective. Like Zuckerberg might think, \u2018Well, I went around to a bunch of states and I ate barbecue and wrestled cattle so I\u2019ve been around all kinds of people.\u2019 But to have people who you respect and listen to have fundamentally different worldviews and question your core logic and think that you may be way off track, that\u2019s a much harder thing to do. And there are people who can be very powerful and comfortable with that. I\u2019ll mention one, whose name is Barack Obama.\u201dI ask Mr. Lanier about the sexual harassment and gender inequity problems roiling the Valley.\u201cWell, sometimes, I think there\u2019s a kind of emerging new male jerk persona of the digital age, which would be some kind of a cross between the Uber guy and the pharma bro and maybe Milo Yiannopoulos and maybe Palmer Luckey and maybe Steve Bannon,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause, there\u2019s this sort of smug, superior, \u2018I\u2019ve got the levers of power, and I know better than you.\u2019 It\u2019s sort of this weird combination of a lot of power and a lot of insecurity at the same time.\u201d He believes that Gamergate led to the alt right. \u201cIt was one of the feeders,\u201d he says.He talks about another personality that is emerging from the digital age.\u201cIf you\u2019re a mark of social media, if you\u2019re being manipulated by it, one of the ways to tell is if there\u2019s a certain kind of personality quality that overtakes you,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been called the snowflake quality. People criticize liberal college kids who have it, but it\u2019s exactly the same thing you see in Trump. It\u2019s this kind of highly reactive, thin-skinned, outraged single-mindedness. I think one way to think of Trump, even though he is a con man and he is an actor and he\u2019s a master manipulator and all that, in a sense he\u2019s also a victim. I\u2019ve met him a few times over 30 years. And what I think I see is someone who has moved from kind of a New York character who was in on his own joke to somebody who is completely freaked out and outraged and feeling like he is on the verge of a catastrophe every second. And so my theory about that is that he was ruined by social media.\u201dMr. Lanier plays me a song he composed to cheer up his wife when she was going through cancer treatments, a Cuban-style charanga flute solo played on a Japanese shakuhachi \u2014 \u201cwhich is a crazy-hard thing to do and I pulled it off.\u201dThen he confides his fear that one of his older cats, Loof, would have been a Trump supporter.\u201cLoof is the sweetest cat in the world but she\u2019s really an anti-immigrant voter,\u201d he says. \u201cShe did not like the idea of young cats coming here. She really didn\u2019t want the change. She really felt like they ruined everything. And I must point out that the new kittens who came are black kittens. They appear to be Bombay cats. Loof is not in a basket of deplorables. She\u2019s just in a basket of blankets.\u201dAs I get ready to leave, the grand illusionist offers an intriguing theory about why the internet is more obsessed with cats than dogs.\u201cI think we know that Facebook is turning us into trained dogs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know we\u2019re being trained. We can feel ourselves being turned into trained circus animals. And we long for that independence that cats show. So when you look at a cat video, what you\u2019re really seeing is this receding identity that you want to cling to and find again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Starbucks Is Criticized for Its Holiday Cups. Yes, Again.", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThanksgiving is right around the corner, which means it is time to embark on a modern American holiday tradition: over-analyzing seasonally available Starbucks cups for signs of liberal nefariousness.But that big-tent approach wasn\u2019t enough to avoid controversy. This year, critics wonder if Starbucks is using its holiday cups to promote homosexuality.What is going on here, you may ask? Read on.The online video that introduced the 2017 holiday cup on Nov. 1 featured a diverse cast of Starbucks customers, including a pair of cartoon women who were shown holding hands.The nature of their relationship was not specified, but some viewers saw them as a nod toward the inclusion of gay and transgender customers.The video itself did not attract negative attention. The latest controversy has focused instead on a pair of gender-neutral hands holding each other on the side of the cup itself.It suggested the cup was \u201ctotally gay.\u201d\u201cWhile people who follow both Starbucks holiday cup news and L.G.B.T. issues celebrated the video, the ordinary Starbucks customer probably didn\u2019t realize the cup might have a gay agenda,\u201d BuzzFeed said.After that, it was off to the races.Fox said it asked Starbucks about the cartoons but the company \u201cneither confirms nor denies the allegations,\u201d by which it presumably meant the promotion of lesbianism.But in an email to The Times, Starbucks said it would let customers decide for themselves what the cup was about.\u201cThis year\u2019s hand-drawn cup features scenes of celebrating with loved ones \u2014 whoever they may be,\u201d said Sanja Gould, a company spokeswoman. \u201cWe intentionally designed the cup so our customers can interpret it in their own way, adding their own color and illustrations.\u201dLike many divisive cultural debates, arguments over the Christian bona fides of seasonal Starbucks cups appear to have intensified during the 2016 presidential campaign as political and social tensions heightened in many areas of American life.In 2015, Starbucks announced it would remove traditional holiday symbols, like reindeer and Christmas trees, from its holiday cups in favor of a more minimalist red design.In a statement released at the time, the company said it wanted to \u201ccreate a culture of belonging, inclusion and diversity\u201d and meant the cups as an invitation for \u201ccustomers to tell their Christmas stories in their own way, with a red cup that mimics a blank canvas.\u201dOne of the people who weighed in on the 2015 Starbucks controversy was then-presidential candidate Donald J. Trump, who frequently used his campaign speeches to complain about people and retailers who say \u201chappy holidays\u201d instead of \u201cmerry Christmas.\u201d\u201cI have one of the most successful Starbucks, in Trump Tower,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cMaybe we should boycott Starbucks? I don\u2019t know. Seriously, I don\u2019t care. That\u2019s the end of that lease, but who cares?\u201dWhen asked why Starbucks, a mammoth global brand, seemed to get ensnared in seasonal controversies so often, Ms. Gould, the spokeswoman, demurred.In an email, she said that each customer\u2019s experience was \u201cintensely personal,\u201d and said the company was \u201chumbled by how passionate customers are about our holiday cups.\u201dHe said this year he was focused on \u201cbuilding a friendship and witnessing to a gay black man who works at the Starbucks\u201d he frequents instead of stoking online outrage.\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be taking him to dinner soon and hopefully sharing the rest of the gospel with him,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s your controversy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lessons From Hurricane Harvey: Houston\u2019s Struggle Is America\u2019s Tale", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "HOUSTON \u2014 The mayhem that Hurricane Harvey unleashed on Houston didn\u2019t only come from the sky. On the ground, it came sweeping in from the Katy Prairie some 30 miles west of downtown.Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point.How climate change is challenging the world\u2019s urban centers.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.Water drains naturally in this stretch of Texas, or at least it used to. At more than 600 square miles, Houston has grown to be as big as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia combined, a giant spread of asphalt smothering many of the floodplains that once shuttled water from the prairies to the sea. When finished, the newest road to ring the city and propel its expansion, called the Grand Parkway, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island.For years, the local authorities turned a blind eye to runaway development. Thousands of homes have been built next to, and even inside, the boundaries of the two big reservoirs devised by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1940s after devastating floods. Back then, Houston was 20 miles downstream, its population 400,000. Today, these reservoirs are smack in the middle of an urban agglomeration of six million.The story of Harvey, Houston and the city\u2019s difficult path forward is a quintessentially American tale. Time and again, America has bent the land to its will, imposing the doctrine of Manifest Destiny on nature\u2019s most daunting obstacles. We have bridged the continent with railways and roads, erected cities in the desert, and changed the course of rivers.Built on a mosquito-infested Texas swamp, Houston similarly willed itself into a great city. It is the country\u2019s energy capital, home to oil and carbon-producing giants, to the space industry, medical research and engineers of every stripe. Its sprawl of highways and single-family homes is a postwar version of the American dream.Unfortunately, nature always gets the last word. Houston\u2019s growth contributed to the misery Harvey unleashed. The very forces that pushed the city forward are threatening its way of life.Sprawl is only part of the story. Houston is also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Many Texans regard this as the key to prosperity, an antidote to Washington. It encapsulates a potent vision of an unfettered America.Harvey called that concept into question. It may have been an unusually bad hurricane, dumping trillions of gallons of water in a few days, even more to the east of the city than to the west, in the prairie, and setting all kinds of records. But it was also the third big storm to slam Houston in three years, dispelling any notion that Houston shouldn\u2019t expect more of the same.Cypress CreekAddicksReservoirHOUSTONBarkerReservoirBuffalo BayouBuildings DamagedBy Hurricane HarveyBrays BayouThousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain.100-year floodplainProperties with flood damage inHurricane Harvey        Cypress CreekAddicksReservoirHOUSTONBuffalo BayouBarkerReservoirBuildings Damaged byHurricane HarveyBrays BayouThousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain.100-year floodplainProperties with flood damage inHurricane Harvey        Buildings Damaged By Hurricane HarveyAddicksReservoirHOUSTONBarkerReservoirThousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain.100-year floodplainProperties with flood damage inHurricane Harvey        Cypress CreekAddicksReservoirHOUSTONBarkerReservoirBuffalo BayouBraysBayouBuildings DamagedBy Hurricane HarveyThousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain.100-year floodplainProperties with flood damage inHurricane Harvey        By The New York TimesThat said, scientists have little doubt that climate change is making storms worse and more frequent. The floods that ravaged Houston on Memorial Day in 2015 and in April of 2016 \u2014 now called the Tax Day flood \u2014 left behind billions of dollars in damage. Coming right after those events, Harvey has led even some pro-development enthusiasts to rethink the city and its surroundings.Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.\u201cThree 500-year floods in three years means either we\u2019re free and clear for the next 1,500 years,\u201d as he put it, \u201cor something has seriously changed.\u201dAfter every natural calamity, American politicians make big promises. They say: We will rebuild. We will not be defeated. Never again will we be caught unprepared.But they rarely tackle the toughest obstacles. The hard truth, scientists say, is that climate change will increasingly require moving \u2014 not just rebuilding \u2014 entire neighborhoods, reshaping cities, even abandoning coastlines.Resettling neighborhoods, making certain places off-limits to development, creating dikes and reservoirs is difficult, both financially and politically. It takes longer than most election cycles. Memories fade. Inertia sets in. Residents just want to get their lives back to normal. Politicians want votes, not trouble.After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans, for better and worse, used its cataclysm as an opportunity to reboot, not just fixing levees but overhauling public schools, hospitals and many neighborhoods. It was a wrenching process. The mere suggestion of moving people out of vulnerable neighborhoods set off bitter protests, causing the city to back down from some of its most sweeping proposals.Texas after Harvey is no different, and perhaps even less prepared to change. Like the rest of America, it is deeply divided between urban and rural, Democrat and Republican. Houston is a blue city with a black mayor in a bright red state. Here, especially in the hurricane\u2019s wake, debates over the way ahead have split conservatives from one another and put environmentalists at odds with advocates of affordable housing.Ultimately, though, any resolution will require that everyone face the same threats together.Jim Blackburn, a planner, environmental lawyer and something of a lightning rod around here, has been warning for years about climate change, the decrepit state of Houston\u2019s reservoirs and the perils of developing the Katy Prairie. He remembers escaping years ago to the prairie to bird watch. One recent morning he drove me out there along the Grand Parkway and pulled into an unfinished subdivision.A saleswoman in a model home boasted about $1 billion worth of box stores and malls being built nearby. The development, she said, adheres to county standards requiring that houses be raised above the 100-year floodplain. The woman handed Mr. Blackburn a glossy brochure and a disclaimer, which he scanned before climbing back into the car, shaking his head.The disclaimer explained that roads outside the development, linking it to the parkway, occupy the 10-year floodplain, meaning they would have about a 10 percent chance of flooding every year.\u201cThese days that means they\u2019ll flood anytime you look at them funny,\u201d Mr. Blackburn said. \u201cIt\u2019s the new normal.\u201dThat\u2019s not far-off. The number of \u201cheavy precipitation\u201d events in the United States has skyrocketed since the 1960s. Since 1980, instances of extreme weather \u2014 hurricanes, floods, heat waves \u2014 linked to climate change have cost the United States $1.1 trillion. Studies show that for every dollar spent upfront in preparedness, American taxpayers could save $4 in emergency relief and reconstruction \u2014 not counting health costs, the impact of lost jobs and business revenues and incalculable grief.But that requires politicians to agree.\u201cWe suffered nothing short of a catastrophic disaster,\u201d a veteran Texas lobbyist, Bill Miller, said. \u201cIt happens at a time when the people in the governing class in this state don\u2019t believe in taxes and government. But they also don\u2019t want anybody discouraged from coming here, because that\u2019s bad for business.\u201dAn upbeat narrative casts business-friendly Texas in the loner role of swashbuckling cowboy, disdainful of coastal elites. \u201cDon\u2019t California my Texas\u201d has become a rallying cry for Republican state lawmakers and a theme repeated by the governor, Greg Abbott, who has complained about \u201ca patchwork quilt of bans and rules and regulations that is eroding the Texas model.\u201dHe believes cities are the culprit. For years, Texas Republicans promoted local controls to push against federal court orders on issues like desegregation and same-sex marriage. Now state leaders have made a U-turn. Mr. Abbott has complained about \u201cpolitical demagogues using climate change as an excuse to remake the American economy.\u201d At a Republican gathering in June, he talked about the experience of driving out of the state\u2019s capital, Austin.\u201cIt starts smelling different,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cAnd you know what that fragrance is? Freedom.\u201dLittle wonder, post-Harvey, that state and local officials have anointed different flood and recovery czars. Texas is sounding these days like Russia under the Romanovs. The system ensures nobody is clearly in charge.Least of all in Houston. A bill that would have allowed Harris County merely to issue the equivalent of parking tickets to developers violating floodplain regulations \u2014 the sort of regulations that control flooding \u2014 was vetoed by the governor. Two other bills to study flooding in the Houston region, introduced in the last legislative session, died in committee.I met with the mayor in City Hall at the time. He noted that the Legislature had convened a special session to ban gender-neutral bathrooms. \u201cIf they can meet about toilets, why can\u2019t they meet when the toilets overflow?\u201d one frustrated city official said, before Mr. Abbott came up with $50 million from a separate fund to stem growing criticism.Another official, this one with the county, made the point that the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes.\u201cThe whole trans-Mississippi pioneer enterprise was in fact brought to you by the federal government,\u201d says Steven Conn, a historian and author of \u201cAmericans Against the City.\u201dThe hypocrisy of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, resisting federal aid to the New York region after Hurricane Sandy but then requesting it for Texas after Harvey, is in fact part of this same history.Houston\u2019s unregulated sprawl, Mr. Conn added, gives physical form to this politics of \u201cdecentralization and anti-statism.\u201dAt the same time, Houston is in many ways a forward-looking, progressive city. Before it elected Mr. Turner, it elected a mayor who was a lesbian. The city is in thrall to cars and highways and has precious little mass transit, but the municipality of Houston relies more on renewable energy than any other big city in America. Houston has more green space, relative to paved, than New York.Thomas Cole, director of the McGovern Center for Humanities and Ethics at the Texas Medical School of Houston, recalled how, during the 1960s, business leaders and politicians conspired with media executives to desegregate Houston quietly, seeing the turmoil that desegregation was causing elsewhere in the South. Decades later, Houston boasts of becoming the most diverse big city in the country, with comparatively low housing costs that translate to higher levels of minority homeownership.But what does \u201caffordable\u201d really mean if residents have to pay hefty transportation costs and rebuild, time and again, after floods? Houston\u2019s affordability leans on loosely regulated, low-cost immigrant labor providing an abundance of cheaply made, slab-on-grade, single-family houses that sprawl on all that open land, in areas like the Katy Prairie.Harris County officials say they have received as many requests for buyouts since the hurricane (3,000) as there have been buyouts since the mid-1990s. Harvey turned out to be an equal opportunity disaster. In Meyerland, an affluent district where Brays Bayou burst its banks, Steve and Julie Sacks\u2019s house flooded for the third time in three years. They are among the homeowners hoping for a buyout.\u201cBut I\u2019m not counting on one,\u201d Mr. Sacks told me. Buying out rich homes to repurpose vulnerable areas like Meyerland for flood detention, as Mr. Sacks notes, would require loads of money and remove valuable properties from tax rolls in a county that relies on property taxes.Bruce Hooper would move, too. During Harvey, he woke up to crackling sounds, when floodwaters started to seep into his appliances and electrical outlets. Mr. Hooper lives in a poor area called Kashmere Gardens. I found him sitting on a tattered lawn chair outside the shell of his tumbledown rental. An unemployed former parks employee, Mr. Hooper told me that he and his family of five had to be airlifted out by the Coast Guard after a detention pond overflowed and water inside the house rose from ankle to chest high in an hour. He would live elsewhere, he said, but like many others without flood insurance or savings, \u201cwe got nowhere else to go.\u201dAs for Andy and Christine Kahan, they were among thousands who had no inkling they were especially vulnerable before Harvey. The Kahans own a single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood, Bear Creek Village.\u201cThe damn dam did us in,\u201d Mr. Kahan said. The Kahans\u2019s home was among those houses flooded by the reservoirs, which Harvey for the first time filled and threatened to overflow.Christine Kahan and her husband had lived for 28 years in their house without a flood. Now Ms. Kahan said she would entertain a buyout. A part-time real-estate agent, she advises clients to think twice about buying any home that flooded. Hers is now one of them.But Mr. Kahan says they will stay, for the time being. \u201cI\u2019m not a skeptic about climate change,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt defies logic not to believe something is going on.\u201dI asked how that lined up with his desire not to leave Bear Creek. \u201cHarvey was an exception, an act of God,\u201d he said, then added, \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t make sense. But I\u2019m an optimist.\u201cAt least, I am until the next flood.\u201dWill Houston be any more ready by then?One afternoon I biked with Guy Hagstette around Buffalo Bayou Park. Mr. Hagstette is director of parks and civic projects for the Kinder Foundation, which underwrote much of the $75 million downtown park. We met at Allen\u2019s Landing, where the Buffalo and White Oak Bayous converge before flowing into the Houston Ship Channel. The Allen brothers were real estate swindlers from New York who founded Houston in 1836. After oil turned up beneath the muck and clay, they seemed like prophets.Harvey burst the tall banks of Buffalo Bayou Park, flooding the city\u2019s theater district and City Hall. It collapsed riverbanks and left dunes of silt that buried pedestrian paths, playgrounds and fields.\u201cThis will take a lot more than tweaking,\u201d Mr. Hagstette told me. He meant not just repairing and fortifying the park, but also adapting Houston to the new normal.For starters, that will require fresh numbers. Harris County demands that new developments retain enough rainwater on site to neutralize the effects of a 100-year storm. But those 100-year numbers date back years. They are based on mitigating a storm that averages 13.2 inches of rain in 24 hours. Harvey brought 25.9 inches in 24 hours. The Memorial Day flood dropped 11 inches in three hours. The Tax Day flood dumped 17 inches in 12 hours in the Katy Prairie.\u201cWe need to get climatologists, politicians and policymakers talking to each other,\u201d Jeff Lindner told me. \u201cThey\u2019re not.\u201d As meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District, Mr. Lindner spent five sleepless days and nights during Harvey as an unshakable, tousled expert in a blue, button-down shirt, going on television and providing Houstonians with useful information. We met at the flood control district office one morning.\u201cThere\u2019s little question the earth is warming,\u201d he said, adding as a qualifier: \u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s a natural cycle or human-induced, hotter air holds more moisture. And so for Harris County that means the potential for more extreme events.\u201dMr. Lindner\u2019s concern, he said, is that \u201cby the time policy is in place it will already lag behind the latest information.\u201dMr. Blackburn tells a story about a local hero, Jesse Jones, the former secretary of commerce, who helped secure federal funds for the ship channel. In 1929, Mr. Jones convinced fellow Houston bankers to put aside reserves of cash that prevented city banks from failing in the Depression. What may save Houston today, Mr. Blackburn said, is another common-sense strategy involving stricter controls and infrastructural investments that somehow lets state Republicans acquiesce behind closed doors but beat their chests in public.\u201cThe worst flood has not yet occurred,\u201d Mr. Blackburn noted. A hurricane that pushes a massive storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay, up the ship channel, could overwhelm refineries and unleash a toxic tsunami, killing many and rattling the national economy.The judge and mayor are among those talking about a so-called Ike Dike, named after Hurricane Ike in 2008, which killed dozens in Texas. It would be a massive sea-gate that could block a surge. The scale and engineering would be Texas-size. The cost would be, too.It\u2019s hard to imagine that happening in the current political climate, Washington\u2019s included, when so little gets done. \u201cLooking back, should we have spent more to avoid some of the flooding?\u201d Judge Emmett asked, rhetorically, when we met in his office. \u201cSure. Did taxpayers want to pay more to do those things? No.\u201cWe need a whole new structure of governance,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe\u2019ve built in watersheds, paved roads and highways because we don\u2019t have mass transit.\u201cInevitably, it all catches up with us,\u201d the judge said. \u201cMother Nature has a long memory.\u201dProduced by Rumsey Taylor.

{"Headline": "Tencent of China Raises Its Stake in Struggling Snap", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLess than 24 hours after disappointing Wall Street yet again, Snap promoted a new vote of confidence from a significant backer: Tencent Holdings, the Chinese internet giant.In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Snap, the parent of the disappearing messaging app Snapchat, disclosed that Tencent had increased its stake in the company to over 12 percent. The Chinese company bought shares on the open market, the filing added.The earnings announcement has spurred analysts and investors to ponder whether Snap, whose initial public offering in March was celebrated on Wall Street, is in trouble. Though it remains a darling of younger users, many of its major functions \u2014 notably its Stories video feature \u2014 have been copied by competitors, in particular Facebook.Before its market debut, Snap had been lauded as being hipper and more innovative than Facebook and other social media companies. Since going public, however, it has had to address slower-than-expected user growth, rising costs and investor doubts about its strategy for dealing with both. Other problems that the company has grappled with include overestimating demand for its Spectacles camera-equipped sunglasses, a once-hot product whose sales cooled rapidly.During a call with analysts on Tuesday, Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, said that the company was focused on issues like simplifying the ad-purchase process on its platform and making its core app easier to use, a longstanding complaint. He also promoted the company\u2019s efforts to expand its content and augmented-reality offerings.\u201cI guess we\u2019re just not afraid to make changes in the long-term interest of the business,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said on the call. \u201cSo I would expect us to continue learning as we grow the business and making changes that we think are in the best interest of growing the user base, growing revenue and, ultimately, providing our customers with a great product experience.\u201dThat he spoke openly about his priorities marked a change for the Mr. Spiegel, who is normally tight-lipped about his strategy. Such an approach has frustrated investors who have sought a better sense of where the company was headed.But now, Snap has the support of Tencent. The Chinese company has had a history of taking stakes in chat apps, such as Snap, in order to learn more about how they work and how they perform from a business perspective. It has long held a stake, for example, in South Korea\u2019s Kakao.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Snap said that Tencent and its affiliates had \u201crecently acquired\u201d 145.8 million nonvoting shares through purchases in the open market.That represents nearly 17 percent of Snap\u2019s class A shares, which hold no voting power, and about 12 percent of its total shares.A Tencent spokesman said at a company conference in Chengdu, China, that it viewed the Snap stake as a strategic investment.\u201cWe saw Snap as an innovative company with a huge user base that is mostly focused on Western, developed markets,\u201d he said.Snap described Tencent as a long-term shareholder, but it did not disclose the Chinese company\u2019s total holdings. It said it had no obligation to disclose changes in Tencent\u2019s holdings of nonvoting shares because of Snap\u2019s ownership structure.So far, stock market investors do not appear heartened by Tencent\u2019s move. Shares in Snap were down nearly 15 percent on Wednesday, to $12.91 \u2014 well below the company\u2019s initial offering price of $17 a share.Raymond Zhong contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

On Election Day itself, about 10 million people saw ads purchased by the Kremlin on Facebook, the company has said.Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said the company hoped the tool would help Americans who liked a page or followed an account created by a Russian agent, though he acknowledged that it stopped short of being able to help the much wider circle of people who viewed Russian propaganda shared by their friends.Facebook executives previously said they doubted whether they had the ability to reach out to every single American who was exposed to Russian government-backed propaganda.\u201cIt\u2019s a much more challenging issue to identify and notify reliably people who may have been exposed to this content on an individual basis,\u201d Colin Stretch, the company\u2019s general counsel, said during the appearance before Congress.For now, the tool may only be able to help you if you chose to follow one of the accounts or pages set up by Russian agents on Instagram or Facebook. According to experts who have studied disinformation campaigns, that accounts for only a tiny sliver of the people Facebook estimate were affected by content Russian posted online.\u201cPeople are much more affected by content shared by their friends, they are more likely to click on it and spend time reading it and considering its merits when a trusted friend shares it on their Facebook page,\u201d said Jonathon Morgan, chief executive of New Knowledge, which tracks the spread of misinformation online. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know the extent to which they are influenced by what their trusted social circles post online.\u201dThe lesson?

{"Headline": "Why Putin\u2019s Foes Deplore U.S. Fixation on Election Meddling", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 For months, President Vladimir V. Putin has predictably denied accusations of Russian interference in last year\u2019s American election, denouncing them as fake news fueled by Russophobic hysteria.More surprising, some of Mr. Putin\u2019s biggest foes in Russia, notably pro-Western liberals who look to the United States as an exemplar of democratic values and journalistic excellence, are now joining a chorus of protest over America\u2019s fixation with Moscow\u2019s meddling in its political affairs.What most disturbs Mr. Putin\u2019s critics about what they see as America\u2019s Russia fever is that it reinforces a narrative put forth tirelessly by the state-controlled Russian news media. On television, in newspapers and on websites, Mr. Putin is portrayed as an ever-victorious master strategist who has led Russia \u2014 an economic, military and demographic weakling compared with the United States \u2014 from triumph to triumph on the world stage.\u201cThe Kremlin is of course very proud of this whole Russian interference story. It shows they are not just a group of old K.G.B. guys with no understanding of digital but an almighty force from a James Bond saga,\u201d Mr. Volkov said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis image is very bad for us. Putin is not a master geopolitical genius.\u201dMr. Volkov and others say they have no doubt that Russia did interfere, at least on the margins, in last year\u2019s presidential election campaign. But they complain that the United States consistently inflates Mr. Putin\u2019s impact and portrays his government as far more unified and effective than it really is, cementing his legacy and making him harder to challenge at home.Ultimately, they say, Americans are using Russia as a scapegoat to explain the deep political discord in the United States. That has left many westward-leaning Russians, who have long looked to America for their ideals, in bitter disappointment that the United States seems to be mimicking some of their own country\u2019s least appealing traits.The hunt for a hidden Russian hand behind President Trump\u2019s election victory has caused particular disquiet among liberal-minded Russian journalists.Unlike China and India, which are far more distant culturally and geographically from the United States, he added, Russia is a country on to which alarm over America\u2019s own internal problems can be easily projected.\u201cAmerican liberals are so upset about Trump that they cannot believe he is a real product of American life,\u201d Mr. Kurilla said. \u201cThey try to portray him as something created by Russia. This whole thing is about America, not Russia.\u201dThe first time this happened, he said, was in the decades after the American Civil War, when amid deep trauma over the conflict and a series of corruption scandals, Russia suddenly became the focus of feverish discussion as a model of menacing tyranny. This was largely because of the writings and influential public lectures of George Kennan, an American explorer who returned from Siberia in the 1880s with horrific stories, mostly true, of Russian despotism.Both Mr. Volkov and Mr. Kurilla worry that American intelligence agencies have made it too easy for the Kremlin to deny its interference in the American elections \u2014 and, at the same time, also take credit for it \u2014 by keeping concrete evidence secret, which has only allowed sometimes wild conspiracy theories to take flight.\u201cThis helps the Kremlin a lot. It promotes Putin\u2019s image as a geopolitical mastermind, the smartest and strongest man in the world,\u201d Mr. Volkov said. \u201cIt hurts us a lot that no evidence has been released. And it helps Russian propaganda because the Kremlin can say it is all just a conspiracy against Russia.\u201dThe state-run Russian news media, while echoing the official Kremlin line that Russia has not interfered in any way, often takes barely disguised delight in American accusations that Mr. Putin masterminded a stealthy campaign to undermine the United States.Americans often tend to see Russia as a tightly controlled and finely tuned state machine that induces business people, academics and other Russians to subvert American democracy on orders from Mr. Putin. Mr. Putin\u2019s critics instead see a far more ramshackle structure racked by infighting over access to money, favors and the president\u2019s ear.Mr. Putin\u2019s opponents despair that the United States seems to have been seized by what they view as a Russian-style spasm of paranoia and conspiratorial thinking that puts blame for internal problems on sinister outside forces.Many Russian liberals, for example, were appalled when the state-controlled Russian news media hounded Michael A. McFaul, America\u2019s ambassador in Moscow from 2012 to 2014, and portrayed him as an agent of subversion bent on undermining Mr. Putin.\u201cI think this is a stupid politicized decision that will not hurt it in any way, even symbolically,\u201d Mr. Kovalev said of the Justice Department decision. \u201cPrecisely the opposite: This is undoubtedly a victory for RT. They now have the status of a victim of censorship, which doesn\u2019t exist in reality, and an excuse to go after their own internal enemies.\u201dA few independent Russian media outlets have investigated the Russian meddling story, including RBC, a newspaper that recently produced an in-depth report on how a so-called troll factory of paid online agitators based in St. Petersburg had tried to incite street protests in the United States through postings on the internet by a phony group claiming to represent disenfranchised black Americans.But reporting in the independent Russian news media has often focused on how little real impact such disruptive efforts have had, leaving readers with the impression that the main victims are not so much American voters but Russian taxpayers, whose money has gone to support an array of well-funded but largely ineffective operations.\u201cThe difference between suspicion and evidence has become blurred when it comes to the American election. This makes myself and others very disappointed,\u201d said Maria Lipman, a veteran Russian journalist.Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, who earned millions lobbying for years on behalf of dictators around the world, \u201cdid not need lessons in dirty tricks from Russia,\u201d Ms. Lipman said. All the same, he has, because of his work in Ukraine for former President Viktor F. Yanukovych, become the prime example among Mr. Trump\u2019s critics of Russia\u2019s hidden hand.Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

After nearly a week in Manus investigating the standoff involving hundreds of asylum seekers who had refused to leave the detention camp that Australia tried to shut down on Oct. 31, I had three notebooks full of interviews with detainees, local leaders and outside experts.Adam and I had also found a way into the camp: We accompanied a few of the asylum seekers as they traveled by boat in the middle of the night to carry in food and medicine.We knew the visit was a risk. A boat captain had been arrested a few nights earlier, and the guards outside the camp were armed.We went anyway because we felt there was no other way to fully show the world what was happening without going inside. (We also believed the worst-case scenarios were unlikely, based on previous trips we\u2019d been told about by men in the camp.)But with a project like this, there are always things that drop out, that diverge from the main point of the piece, or that would simply make it too long.For example, there were men like Imran Mohammed, a Rohingya refugee from Myanmar, who I wished I could have introduced in the article \u2014 to tell readers about the 1,200-page autobiography he has written, by hand, in English, which he learned while detained.There were locals helping the asylum seekers as well, whom I could not identify for fear they would be targeted by Papua New Guinea or Australian authorities.And there were moments of tension, too.One sweltering afternoon, while I was waiting for an interview, I saw a Pakistani asylum seeker stumbling, drunk and swearing, toward one of the guards at a detention facility closer to Lorengau. I did what I could to de-escalate the situation, but I left wondering when that might happen again \u2014 and when the tension settling all over the island as a result of Australia\u2019s extended detention might erupt into violence.While we look into that, here are a few visual outtakes from Adam, powerful photos that also did not make it into the original piece.And I have one thing to add. It\u2019s Thanksgiving today for Americans like me and since most of this newsletter\u2019s readers (and our staff) are Australian, I feel compelled to explain our simple tradition: We all share at least one thing we\u2019re thankful for.So this year, I\u2019m thankful for ...\u2022 The smell of the ocean, which seems to rise up all over Sydney whenever a touch of calm is needed.\u2022 Sausage sizzles, avo toast and Four Pillars gin. Not necessarily all together.\u2022 Our Australia team: Smart, curious and collegial, they\u2019ve embraced this experiment with gusto.\u2022 My wife and kids, adventurers all.\u2022 And finally, our readers and guides.There are so many Australians who have generously shared their experiences and insight about this country, from novelists to Uber drivers to the sources who will not be named \u2014 to the readers of this newsletter, who overwhelm me every week with thoughtful responses.Seriously, Australia, thanks for having us and supporting what we do.Now, here\u2019s my roundup of all our Australia stories this week, some other work we love, and a recommendation.______We also wrote about:__________________Dig in.

{"Headline": "Saudi Money Fuels the Tech Industry. It\u2019s Time to Ask Why.", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWe need to talk about the tsunami of questionable money crashing into the tech industry.We should talk about it because that money is suddenly in the news, inconveniently out in the open in an industry that has preferred to keep its connection to petromonarchs and other strongmen on the down low.But mostly we need to talk about this money because, boy, is there a whole lot of it \u2014 and as the world\u2019s moneyed dictators, oligarchs and other characters look for more places to park their billions, mountains more will be coming to Silicon Valley.This presents a conundrum. Tech companies are fond of pseudo-revolutionary mission statements that extol the virtues of diversity, tolerance, freedom of expression and other progressive ideals. They have argued that their technologies are part of a force for global liberation \u2014 that forging more open communication and economic productivity through technology will loosen the grip of tyrannies across the globe. For much of the last year, Silicon Valley has also promised a revolution in its own culture, with large and small companies alike vowing to become more inclusive of women and minorities.The money from regimes that have been criticized for their human rights records \u2014 from Saudi Arabia\u2019s government in particular, which has plans to funnel potentially hundreds of billions of dollars into tech companies through its state-controlled Public Investment Fund \u2014 stands in stark contrast to those aims. By accepting these investments, tech companies get to revel in the branding glory of global good while taking billions from a government that stands against many of those goals \u2014 a government that has an abysmal record with human rights groups, that has systematically marginalized women, that has not had much legal due process and that has advocated an extreme form of Islam that has zero tolerance for just about any religious or intellectual diversity whatsoever.\u201cLook, every company has a choice about their actions and inactions,\u201d said Freada Kapor Klein, co-chairwoman of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, which advocates for a more diverse and inclusive tech industry.She said companies could choose not to do business with governments whose actions they found troubling, but many of today\u2019s tech companies have lost a moral compass. \u201cThere is an elitism that makes it far too easy for them to rationalize their behavior with their belief that they are the smartest guys \u2014 and, yes, it\u2019s always guys \u2014 in the room,\u201d she said.Twitter, which got a $300 million investment from Prince Alwaleed\u2019s Kingdom Holding Company in 2011 \u2014 around the same time that it was talking up its role in the Arab Spring \u2014 declined to comment on his arrest. Lyft, which received $105 million from Prince Alwaleed in 2015, also declined to comment.The founders and investors also brought up the Saudi government\u2019s supposed push for modernization. The Saudis have outlined a long-term plan, Vision 2030, that calls for a reduction in the state\u2019s dependence on oil and a gradual loosening on economic and social restrictions, including a call for greater numbers of women to enter the work force. The gauzy vision allows tech companies to claim to be part of the solution in Saudi Arabia rather than part the problem: Sure, they are taking money from one of the world\u2019s least transparent and most undemocratic regimes, but it\u2019s the part of the government that wants to do better.Another mitigating factor, for some, is the sometimes indirect nature of the Saudi investments. When the SoftBank Vision Fund invests tens of millions or billions into a tech company, it\u2019s true that half of that money is coming from Saudi Arabia. But it\u2019s SoftBank that has control over the course of the investment and communicates with founders. The passive nature of the Saudi investment in SoftBank\u2019s fund thus allows founders to sleep better at night.On the other hand, it also has a tendency to sweep the Saudi money under the rug. When SoftBank invests in a company, the Saudi connection is not always made clear to employees and customers. You get to enjoy the convenience of your WeWork without having to confront its place in the Saudi government\u2019s portfolio.But the tech companies that the Saudis are itching to invest in often do have a choice; they are some of the most highly valued companies of our era, and many of them have no immediate need for more money. For instance: Slack, which raised $250 million from SoftBank last month, said it had no plans for spending the money and instead had raised it to preserve long-term \u201coperational flexibility.\u201dBut why take it from the Saudis? I suspect it\u2019s the most obvious reason: because the money is there, and no one is making too big a fuss about it.It used to be that most of the money in tech came from more vaunted sources \u2014 universities, philanthropies, pension plans and other nonprofits, which made up the bulk of funders to venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.Now we\u2019re in a new era, when giant pools of money splash through sleek-sounding Vision Funds and come out seeming squeaky clean \u2014 and ready to fund the next great thing to make the world so much better, we promise.Advertisement"}

More improvements, including \u201cbig, fat, beautiful tax cuts,\u201d are to come, he said.Speaking from a lavish room at Mar-a-Lago, the club that he and his staff have deemed \u201cthe Winter White House,\u201d he applauded the progress he said was being made in Afghanistan and Iraq, adding that the gains made against the Islamic State in the past year exceeded those during \u201cyears of the previous administration.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re being talked about again as an armed forces,\u201d he said as a few club members lingered outside. \u201cWe\u2019re really winning. We know how to win. But we have to let you win. They weren\u2019t letting you win before.\u201dHe continued extolling the victories during a second event at a Coast Guard station in Riviera Beach. The first lady, Melania Trump, joined him to hand out sandwiches in the station\u2019s mess hall. The first couple had also provided assortments of fruit, muffins and cookies to the service members, some of whom were about to go out on patrol.Mr. Trump, the master marketer, spoke of the Coast Guard in terms few presidents have used. \u201cI think that there is no brand \u2014 of any kind, I\u2019m not just talking about a military branch \u2014 that has gone up more than the Coast Guard,\u201d Mr. Trump told the service members, citing what he described as the organization\u2019s successful response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria this year. \u201cIncredible people, you\u2019ve done an incredible job, and I love coming here and doing this for you today.\u201dHe noted orders for new military equipment, including Coast Guard cutters, Navy ships and Air Force planes, including one that is \u201calmost like an invisible fighter.\u201dThe president then returned to old holiday habits, leaving to spend a few hours at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach before returning to Mar-a-Lago, the club he owns, in an unusual fall rain.The menu was to include traditional fare \u2014 turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy, sweet potatoes with marshmallows \u2014 as well as local produce, red snapper, Florida stone crab and a variety of baked goods, cakes and pies, according to a summary provided by Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the first lady.\u201cWill be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida (Mar-a-Lago),\u201d he wrote on Twitter before spending a few hours at his West Palm Beach golf course. Officials declined to say with whom the president spoke.In the years since Mr. Trump renovated Mar-a-Lago, the former estate of the cereal company heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, into an upscale club and resort, he has relished spending parts of the holiday season there, said Anthony P. Senecal, Mr. Trump\u2019s former butler, who worked at the resort for more than 20 years. This visit was the president\u2019s first to the club since April.\u201cHe\u2019s coming home,\u201d Mr. Senecal said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be overjoyed that he\u2019s at Mar-a-Lago, that he\u2019s near the golf course, that he\u2019s going to see a lot of friends that he hasn\u2019t seen in a great while.\u201dWhile the living room Christmas tree and menorah are usually not up yet, the week of Thanksgiving marks the beginning of the Mar-a-Lago holiday season, after the club\u2019s annual summer closing for repairs and historic restoration, Mr. Senecal said.\u201cThanksgiving is a joyous time,\u201d said Mr. Senecal, who said he had declined a Thanksgiving invitation this year because of medical issues. (Last year, Mr. Trump called Mr. Senecal \u201cobviously a very troubled man\u201d after the discovery of Facebook posts in which Mr. Senecal had called for the execution of Barack Obama.) \u201cThere\u2019s never been any other place.

In 2013, he offered these greetings on Twitter: \u201cHappy Thanksgiving to all \u2014 even the haters and losers!\u201d And on Thursday, he took aim at some of his favorite targets: the reporters trailing him for the duration of his Florida stay.\u201cI\u2019ll ask the press to get out, and I\u2019ll say, \u2018You\u2019re fired,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said as reporters were ushered out of the Mar-a-Lago teleconference. \u201cAnd, by the way, media, happy Thanksgiving, I must say.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company priced its initial public offering at $10, 40 percent below its target. Since then, the stock has tumbled 70 percent to $2.99.Blue Apron has faced increased competition from Amazon and rival meal-kit delivery start-ups. Amazon\u2019s announcement on June 16 that it would purchase Whole Foods Market weighed heavily on the offering. Since then, the company has done little to assuage investors.

This is what the sales factor apportionment system, already in use by most US states, does. Corporations earn income from sales. Therefore income should be allocated based upon the destination of those sales. MNC income should no longer be allocated based upon the location of a subsidiary that allegedly earned it. The location of sales is much more difficult to manipulate than the \u201corigin of income\u201d under the current system.\u201cThe US tax base for corporations would be calculated on the basis of a fraction of companies\u2019 worldwide income. This fraction would be the share of each company\u2019s worldwide sales that are destined for customers in the United States. The taxpayer, under SFA, is the whole unitary business, including all evasion-motivated subsidiaries over which the parent corporations exercise legal and economic control.\u201d\u201cIn effect, firms should be taxed on their access to a specific consumer market - from which they generate revenue - rather than on their cleverness at artificially allocating expenses and revenue in tax havens in which their subsidiaries \u2018incorporate.\u2019\u201d\u201cI think Aspen\u2019s work is needed more than ever.
