{"Headline": "A Tax Cut That Lifts the Economy? Opinions Are Split", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the release of an ambitious overhaul of the tax code, House Republicans are moving to fulfill a long-held desire of corporate America: a large and audacious tax cut.Yet economists are divided over whether the plan is likely to revitalize the economy or merely bestow a windfall on the wealthiest investors.Even before President Trump vowed as a candidate to sharpen America\u2019s competitive edge, Republicans led by the House speaker, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, were arguing that large tax cuts would unleash a hurricane of economic activity.\u201cWith this plan, we are making pro-growth reforms, so that yes, America can compete with the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Ryan told reporters Thursday on Capitol Hill. \u201cThis is a very important and special moment for our country, for all Americans.\u201dEconomists are still parsing the details, but even some ardent supporters of the plan say expectations about heady growth and job gains are exaggerated. Interest rates are already at bargain-basement levels, plenty of potential investment capital is sloshing around, and the official jobless rate is at lows not seen in many years. Moreover, the cost of the tax package will inevitably deepen the deficit and lead to spending cuts that are likely to hit low- and middle-income workers.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the stimulative benefit on the economy,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. \u201cMost of the benefits as best I can tell will go to wealthy people. The idea that you\u2019re going to get a huge spur to growth is delusional.\u201dSuch dismissiveness failed to deter fans of the twin pillars of the House bill: lowering the top nominal tax rate on corporations to 20 percent from 35 percent, and changing the way global profits are taxed.\u201cThis will make the United States a better place to invest and a better place to be headquartered in,\u201d said Mihir A. Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School who has at times complained about the White House\u2019s economic claims.Under the current system, multinational corporations have been shopping around the globe for countries with low tax rates where they can locate their profits and sometimes their operations. Those global profits are taxed by the United States, but only after they are booked at home. The result is that companies warehouse trillions of dollars offshore, indefinitely postponing the payment of United States taxes.Tax rates don\u2019t single-handedly drive investment decisions, and even now deductions and tax credits often shove the rate paid by corporations far below the 35 percent maximum. Still, many economists argue that matching or undercutting the top rate in other advanced industrialized countries \u2014 particularly in Western Europe \u2014 should encourage investment and productivity.Slashing the rate to 20 percent is \u201ca pretty dramatic change in the attractiveness of the United States relative to other countries,\u201d said Alan Viard, a tax specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.Companies were noncommittal on how the plan might actually change their tax practices \u2014 like those of Corning, the glass and ceramics manufacturer, which had $3.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents outside the country on March 31. \u201cGiven the complexity of our U.S. taxation system,\u201d a spokesman said Thursday, \u201cthe devil will lie in the details of any new legislation.\u201dA shift to taxing domestic and not foreign profits is aimed at discouraging multinationals from moving headquarters, investments and recorded profits abroad. Most other nations have embraced some version of this approach, known as a territorial system.But economists are split on whether that will reduce or worsen global tax avoidance. The bill proposes a global minimum tax of 10 percent to ensure that companies will have to pay something no matter where they have their headquarters. If they pay a lower rate in a foreign country, they would have to remit the difference to the United States. What could bite even harder is a proposal to tack a 20 percent excise tax on transactions between multinationals and their foreign affiliates to deter them from stripping profits out of the United States tax base.No safeguards are foolproof, supporters concede, but they argue that\u2019s the price of admission. \u201cThe reality is, base-erosion rules will always be messy and imperfect,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cIf you want a territorial system, get over it.\u201dYet if the House plan resolves some longstanding issues with the corporate tax code, it also creates new ones. Congress has, in effect, set aside $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to pay for revisions to the tax code, but to keep the cost of the plan to that limit, the Republican leadership is relying on financing gimmicks to phase in some provisions, or put time limits on others.A proposal that allows companies to immediately deduct business expenses rather than stretching them over a number of years potentially has the most impact on smaller companies that need money to build up or expand their business. Indeed a hefty chunk of the administration\u2019s growth estimates is based on the extra investing it is supposed to cause.But the proposal has a five-year time limit. \u201cIf expensing goes away at the end of 2022, they should not expect any permanent growth effect,\u201d said Mr. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute.For businesses, predictability about the tax code is as important as any specific alteration. And temporary measures that obscure the costs deter long-term investment. New low rates and breaks will not be sustainable over the long term if they do not provide enough money to run the government.\u201cIf they want to claim credit for the growth effect,\u201d Mr. Viard said, \u201cthen they have to claim responsibility for the revenue loss.\u201dAll would-be tax reformers juggle varying goals. They want to entice domestic and foreign companies to invest in the United States, which should, in turn, produce more jobs and stockholder returns.They want to create a system that is widely judged as fair.And they need to collect enough revenue to keep the lights on. That includes having the money to cover Social Security payments, antiterrorism measures and disaster relief, as well as maintaining or upgrading the educational, transportation, technological and other systems that undergird the nation\u2019s overall economic strength.Critics worry that the focus on corporate competitiveness gives other goals short shrift.\u201cThe corporate rate cuts are a windfall immediately for stockholders, and not workers,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. And because 35 percent of United States stocks are foreign-owned, he calculated that $70 billion a year of the tax benefits would go to people in other countries.As economists can attest, American competitiveness can be an elusive concept.\u201cBusiness folks won\u2019t describe it like this, but I think the best way to describe what it means to be more competitive is to describe it in terms of increasing the standard of living of the American people,\u201d said Michael J. Graetz, a professor of tax law at Columbia Law School. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t do that, then why do we care?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a calculation made by Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Mr. Rosenthal said that foreign investors who owned United States stocks would receive $70 billion a year in tax benefits, not $70 billion over all.Tiffany Hsu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Norway\u2019s Wealth Fund Considers Divesting From Oil Shares", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNorway\u2019s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund is considering a divestment of holdings in international petroleum companies, a sign that even Europe\u2019s dominant producer does not have full confidence in oil\u2019s future.The recommendation on Thursday by the Norwegian Central Bank, which manages the fund, is potentially the biggest advance yet for a global fossil-fuel divestment campaign that has been promoted on college campuses and by environmental activists.It could also be a setback for the proposed initial public offering of the Saudi national oil company, known as Aramco, since the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, the world\u2019s largest, would be a potentially large investor. The public offering depends on high oil prices, while the move by the Norwegian bank suggested uncertainty about the future demand for oil.\u201cIt\u2019s very significant symbolically because it sends a signal that even the people who make money from oil and gas are coming up with divestment plans,\u201d said Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cThe Norwegian view is that oil has had a good run and will have a good run for a couple of decades but it\u2019s not the only future that is out there.\u201dWith roughly $35 billion invested in oil companies, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is a large investor in Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, Chevron and Norway\u2019s own oil giant, Statoil. Statoil has begun to diversify its holdings by building large offshore wind-energy projects.Although it is Europe\u2019s top oil producer, Norway is also a leader in the movement to control climate change. With hefty incentives, roughly 40 percent of cars bought in Norway last year were electric, and the government plans to phase out diesel- and gasoline-fueled cars in the next decade.The potential Norwegian divestment of oil is not expected to happen until late 2018 at the soonest.But on a day when oil prices were down moderately and most global stock markets soared, shares of several large oil companies were down by up to 1 percent.\u201cIt sends a signal that others could follow, and if this becomes a growing movement it could have a material impact,\u201d said Brian M. Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones Investments. \u201cIt shows the global environmental movement continues to gain steam.\u201dEnvironmentalists praised the potential divestment as historically important.\u201cWith Norway\u2019s move, the campaign to divest from dirty fuels will graduate from environmental groups and small businesses like Ben & Jerry\u2019s and colleges to the big time,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, based in Washington. \u201cNorway\u2019s move will fuel divestment even more because Norway is a major oil country.\u201dReligious institutions, pension funds and other financial institutions in more than 70 countries controlling more than $5 trillion in assets have already committed to dropping some of their fossil-fuel holdings in recent years. The movement gained a major push from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Another movement by investors has pressured European and American oil companies to disclose how climate change and future carbon taxes might affect the sustainability of their reserves, arguing that there is a risk to investors that many resources will need to be left in the ground.The future of oil will also be dependent on demand and prices. There is a hot debate among analysts about exactly when demand for oil will peak. Some note that with the economies of China and other developing countries growing, there are decades more of growth for oil. BP has projected that the global auto fleet will double by 2035 to 1.8 billion vehicles.But others say the electric cars and more efficient internal combustion engines will dominate transportation in the future, and deeply depress demand in gasoline and diesel. Several major car companies are investing in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, and Exxon Mobil is investing in advanced biofuels.Royal Dutch Shell has projected that gasoline demand is likely to peak by the 2030s. Chevron\u2019s departing chief executive, John Watson, recently said he was confident of demand growth for oil over the next decade or two.\u201cThere is no sign of peak demand right now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "If You Bought In to TIAA Based on Reputation, Check Your Accounts", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyFor years, TIAA has nurtured a perception among its clients that it is different from a typical profit-seeking financial services firm.Its literature and advertising touted its \u201cmission-based approach\u201d and \u201cnonprofit heritage,\u201d leading many of its customers \u2014 typically professors, private-school teachers, hospital employees and similar workers \u2014 to believe TIAA took more benevolent approach.That has led some who hold accounts at TIAA to take a closer look at their own investments. As the largest administrator of retirement accounts known as 403(b) plans, TIAA hold $341 billion in assets \u2014 40 percent of the market, according to the data analytics firm Cerulli. These accounts are similar to 401(k)\u2019s but used largely by workers in education, health care, religious institutions and other nonprofits.\u201cI can see how the advertising/marketing wording might lead someone to infer TIAA acts in the interest of participants,\u201d said Richard Shafer, a former TIAA executive who managed its services on the West Coast before leaving the company in 2005. \u201cNot so.\u201dChad Peterson, a spokesman for TIAA, said that as a result of the questions raised by The Times, it has begun \u201ca thorough review to ensure its actions and sales practices are aligned with our mission and values.\u201dIf you\u2019re holding TIAA products, there is no need to make any rash decisions \u2014 in fact, you may be in a 403(b) plan with low-cost, diversified investments \u2014 but there are several groups that should carefully scrutinize their holdings in the wake of these allegations:Many of TIAA\u2019s retirement plans are anchored by its CREF variable annuities, which act like mutual funds but can later be annuitized, or transformed into a stream of income in retirement. But some consultants and advisers say it is not worth paying extra to save in this type of product, especially over many years, because it doesn\u2019t provide much more than the chance to buy a stream of income later \u2014 something many workers may not want anyway.The quality and cost of the investments in TIAA\u2019s 403(b) accounts vary widely, according to plan consultants, who say that much depends on the size of the plan and the employer. Larger employers often have more competitive offerings, with lower-cost investments on their menus, and may include a mix of products from TIAA\u2019s competitors like Vanguard.Other workers, however, are squirreling their hard-earned savings into 403(b) plans that are largely stocked with more expensive funds and variable annuities.Just months after Joel Thurtell lost his wife to Alzheimer\u2019s about two years ago, he received a pitch from a TIAA financial adviser. He decided to take the offer because his late wife, a doctor and professor, had held a large portion of her retirement savings at TIAA during her career \u2014 and they had always believed that TIAA was a superior option.But he began to question his decision after calculating his total costs, which he said amounted to more than 1.4 percent of his assets annually, to oversee a collection of 13 funds. He ultimately moved to Vanguard, where he pays about 0.37 percent of assets for a similar service.\u201cI had this idea that they weren\u2019t in it for the money,\u201d said Mr. Thurtell, 72, a retired newspaper reporter.TIAA said that for the range of support provided, it believes the service is competitively priced.Ultimately, the employers sponsoring 403(b) plans are responsible \u2014 as the plan\u2019s fiduciary steward \u2014 for choosing the provider and assembling a collection of reasonably priced, prudent investment options.But employers must also pay close attention to what else the fees may be covering. Mr. Shafer, the plan consultant, offered an example: If the employer allows deductions from the plan\u2019s money to pay for TIAA representatives to educate plan participants, they must ensure those advisers are acting in the best interest of workers.One of TIAA\u2019s most popular fixed annuities \u2014 the TIAA Traditional \u2014 attracts workers with the promise of paying a competitive guaranteed interest rate on contributions. But many people don\u2019t realize that some versions of the product lock up their money, only allowing withdrawals to be taken in installments over roughly ten years \u2014 a condition that critics say the company hasn\u2019t always clearly explained.\u201cI have probably spoken to hundreds of teachers who have money in the illiquid version of the TIAA Traditional,\u201d said Douglas Lynam, director of educator retirement services at LongView Asset Management in Santa Fe, N.M. \u201cYet very few teachers are aware of the withdrawal restrictions.\u201d(TIAA said those restrictions are outlined in numerous places.)By locking the money up, TIAA can invest it in longer-term illiquid assets that pay higher returns than shorter-term investments.Given its higher rate of interest, some financial planners say the TIAA Traditional can serve a helpful role within the bond side of an investor\u2019s portfolio \u2014 as long as customers grasp the terms. But understanding the fine print and restrictions can be a challenge.\u201cTIAA Traditional is bewilderingly complex and dealing with TIAA is based on trust rather than a straightforward contractual agreement,\u201d said Tomas Dvorak, professor of economics at Union College and a member of its retirement plan committee, which helps oversee employees\u2019 403(b) plans administered by Fidelity and TIAA.And some customers have reported having difficulty getting answers. Jody Newman, a certified financial planner in Tiburon, Calif., embarked on a yearlong odyssey to find out how much her client might receive if he annuitized his income, held in three different versions of the Traditional. She \u2018\u2018never got to the bottom of it,\u2019\u2019 she said.She also wanted to ensure her client\u2019s lifetime annuity payments would never decrease, which is how it generally works with so-called immediate annuities, which retirees buy when they want a guaranteed stream of income.TIAA said its Traditional product, when in payout mode, provides a guaranteed minimum payment and strives to pay more than that amount; it said it has only had to lower payments from that extra amount four times since 1949.But when Ms. Newman\u2019s client asked TIAA how many times its monthly annuity payments have declined over the past 25 years, the client was told that access to that information has been \u201chistorically restricted.\u201d\u201cEverything is so complex and opaque with TIAA,\u201d she said, \u201cthat it is hard to be sure of anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Amid reports of a possible suit by the Justice Department to block the deal on antitrust grounds, the share price could easily drop further.There seems to be a compelling reason for the market reaction: Unless AT&T acquires it, Time Warner simply doesn\u2019t appear to be worth the price its shares were commanding. But there is a competing perspective: The market may well be making a mistake.\u201cI think Time Warner is probably worth a lot more than the market is saying now,\u201d said Brian Wieser, senior research analyst with the Pivotal Research Group. \u201cI think the deal will ultimately be completed.

It may take until April instead of the end of 2017 to complete the merger if the Department of Justice \u201cdecides to sue to block the deal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf the deal falls apart, which we do not expect, we believe there is minimal downside.\u201dThe analysts\u2019 logic is straightforward.First, consider what Time Warner\u2019s stock price has been telling us. Only several weeks ago, the stock market gauged the probability of the deal\u2019s completion at virtually 100 percent. By Wednesday, that had plummeted well below 50 percent. But there\u2019s money to be made if it turns out that the market\u2019s assessment of one month ago was more accurate than its judgment of today.Figuring out these probabilities involves several factors: computing the price that AT&T would pay for Time Warner in a completed merger, which depends, in part, on where AT&T\u2019s own price stands at that moment; assessing Time Warner\u2019s value without a merger of any kind; and comparing those numbers with Time Warner\u2019s current price.This kind of calculation is standard practice on Wall Street. As a merger draws close to culmination, the price of the soon-to-be acquired stock tends to converge with the price that the stock will be worth in the merger. That convergence had occurred in this case. For weeks, Time Warner shares traded at a price equal to that ultimate merger value, reflecting the market\u2019s view that the deal was a fait accompli.Assume for a moment that the merger is ultimately completed. Then, Time Warner is undervalued now. But even if the merger collapses, Mr. Wieser said, Time Warner is already in play and is likely to be acquired by another suitor. That, too, would make it undervalued.Next assume that Time Warner stays independent. Its earnings have been strong, Mr. Gould said, and its cash reserves would enable it to buy back perhaps $7 billion of its own stock, bolstering its price. Mr. Wieser said an independent Time Warner would probably be worth about $81 a share, a modest decline. Buying now is a risk, he acknowledged, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big risk, and the potential reward is high.\u201dFor individuals who are saving for retirement, there is another risk. The overall stock market has been rising for years, but it could fall, pulling most stocks down with it, especially those that already have downward momentum. Buying a stock like Time Warner now may be best for those with strong convictions or deep pockets or, ideally, both. But Time Warner\u2019s troubles could be a profit opportunity for investors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Sells \u2018Rocket Fuel\u2019 Tax Plan as Economy Strengthens", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. CHARLES, Mo. \u2014 President Trump rallied support on Wednesday for his tax plan in a Missouri county where the unemployment rate is 2.7 percent, a fitting backdrop for a speech in which he bragged about the health of the economy while contending that a major tax cut was crucial to economic growth.Republicans have juggled those twin claims in pitching their tax bill, which was introduced at the beginning of November and remains on course to reach Mr. Trump\u2019s desk next month. They insist that the plan will deliver an immediate stimulus and encourage long-term investment.\u201cThese massive tax cuts will be rocket fuel\u201d for the American economy, particularly for small businesses on Main Street, Mr. Trump said in a speech here.But some economists question whether rocket fuel is needed at this point in the economic recovery and say that too much stimulus could ultimately backfire.The economy is strengthening and unemployment is at its lowest point in 16 years. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the economy had expanded at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, above the maximum sustainable level of output estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.Mr. Trump played up that report in a long riff, saying that the growth rate would have been \u201c4 percent, maybe over 4 percent\u201d if not for late summer hurricanes. \u201cWe are hitting numbers that nobody thought possible, certainly not in this time\u201d in office, he said, adding, \u201cThis is all done without the tax cuts.\u201dThe entire developed world is enjoying a simultaneous economic expansion for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, and the Fed and other economic forecasters see few obstacles to continued growth on the horizon.\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of tax stimulus at the current time because the economy doesn\u2019t really need it,\u201d William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said on Monday.The dispute about the economic effect of the tax plan is playing out at high speed because Republicans are rushing to pass the plan without the rounds of hearings and competing economic analyses that have shaped past efforts to substantially overhaul the federal tax code.Cutting taxes is likely to bolster short-term economic growth by encouraging more spending. But officials at the Federal Reserve have warned that the American economy is already growing around the maximum sustainable pace, meaning that faster growth is likely to cause higher inflation. The Fed could seek to dampen that effect by moving to raise interest rates more quickly.\u201cEconomic growth appears to have stepped up from its subdued pace early in the year,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, told Congress\u2019s Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday.\u201cWe welcome strong growth,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re worried about trends that could push inflation above our 2 percent objective.\u201dThose concerns are shared by independent economists. Inflation has remained sluggish since the financial crisis; this is the sixth straight year that inflation is likely to run below 2 percent. But some economists see evidence that the pace of price increases is already strengthening.Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation was already rising fast in metropolitan areas with low unemployment. Mr. Shepherdson has revised his forecasts upward for next year, in part because of accelerating business investment. That, in addition to a tax cut, would be \u201clike a double boost for an economy that doesn\u2019t need a single boost,\u201d he said.Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, said Monday that the Fed might need to raise interest rates more quickly even if growth did not accelerate. Some economists argue larger federal deficits can increase inflation. If tax cuts did increase inflation, or increased expectations of inflation, Mr. Evans said he would favor raising interest rates more quickly in response.Proponents of the tax plan contend that it will also increase the nation\u2019s economic capacity. They say that cutting corporate taxes, in particular, will encourage more investment. That will raise productivity, resulting in faster economic growth without increased inflation.The direct benefits of the tax cuts would mostly accrue to the wealthiest Americans, but Republicans say that increased investment will ultimately raise wages, too. Wage growth has remained sluggish in recent years even as the unemployment rate has declined.Some economic forecasters have increased their estimates for economic growth next year, both as a result of underlying improvement in the economy and in anticipation of a significant tax cut.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said it expected the American economy to grow 2.5 percent next year, up from a forecast of 2.4 percent six months ago.The potential pace of economic growth \u2014 the effective speed limit for the American economy \u2014 is determined by two factors: the expansion of the work force and the productivity of the average worker. Both have grown slowly in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue.The slower growth of the work force reflects the aging of the population as the baby boom generation moves into retirement. The youngest members of that generation will be 62 by 2026. It also reflects the reduced volume of immigration. The number of people moving to the United States has declined in recent years, and the Trump administration is working to further reduce the volume of both legal and illegal immigration to the United States.The reasons for the slow growth of productivity are less clear.And the problem is becoming worse. Productivity last year fell 0.2 percent.Some Republicans, including Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, contend that economic growth is already increasing partly in anticipation of a tax cut, and that failing to pass legislation would send stocks tumbling and curtail growth.It is a matter of basic logic that lower taxes should encourage corporate investment by increasing the profitability of those investments. But studies generally find the benefits are modest, and corporate executives often discount the importance of tax rates in their decision-making.When Gary D. Cohn, President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, recently asked a gathering of chief executives to raise their hands if the proposed tax cuts would affect their investment plans, only a few raised their hands. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the other hands up?\u201d Mr. Cohn asked.Another question is whether higher interest rates might offset the benefits of a tax cut. Critics of the Republican plan argue it would increase the federal debt, which would drive up rates as the government competes with private borrowers for the money it needs to fund its operations.Proponents of the plan argue that those effects are greatly overstated. They say that the government will be able to borrow the money it needs in global markets without driving up rates.Jim Tankersley reported from St. Charles, Mo., and Binyamin Appelbaum from Washington.Advertisement"}

No, but automobiles are actually a model for the public health approach I\u2019m suggesting.We don\u2019t ban cars, but we work hard to regulate them \u2013 and limit access to them \u2013 so as to reduce the death toll they cause. This has been spectacularly successful, reducing the death rate per 100 million miles driven by 95 percent since 1921.Take a look at the history of motor vehicle safety since World War II:Deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled19469.3581968  First federal safety standards for cars64201621.18\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910sDeaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled19469.35First seatbelt offered in an American carFirst federal safety standards for cars81974  55 m.p.h. national speed limit1993  Car safety ratings introduced61978  Tennessee is first to require child safety seats1999  Airbags, invented in 1951, become mandatory1984  4New York is first to require seat belt use2000  Mandatory reporting of defects by carmakers201621.18\u201946\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s2000s\u201910s\u201916Frankly, liberal opposition to guns has often been ineffective, and sometimes counterproductive. The 10-year ban on assault weapons accomplished little, partly because definitions were about cosmetic features like bayonet mounts (and partly because even before the ban, such guns were used in only 2 percent of crimes).The left sometimes focuses on \u201cgun control,\u201d which scares off gun owners and leads to more gun sales. A better framing is \u201cgun safety\u201d or \u201creducing gun violence,\u201d and using auto safety as a model\u2014constant efforts to make the products safer and to limit access by people who are most likely to misuse them.What would a public health approach look like for guns if it were modeled after cars? It would include:If someone steals my iPhone, it\u2019s useless, and the same should be true of guns. Gun manufacturers made child-proof guns back in the 19th century (before dropping them), and it\u2019s time to advance that technology today. Some combination of smart guns and safe storage would also reduce the number of firearms stolen in the U.S. each year, now about 200,000, and available to criminals.We also need to figure out whether gun buybacks, often conducted by police departments, are cost-effective and help reduce violence. And we can experiment more with anti-gang initiatives, such as Cure Violence, that have a good record in reducing shootings.Estimated Percent of Households WithGuns, by StateHawaiiMass.U.S. AVERAGE: 32% OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE GUNS R.I.N.J.N.Y.Del.Conn.Ill.Calif.Fla.Md.Wash.N.H.Ind.OhioCo.Pa.IowaMinn.Ariz.Nev.N.D.Mich.Va.Ore.N.M.N.C.Tex.S.C.Neb.Kan.Ga.Mo.Okla.Wisc.La.Ky.UtahAla.MaineTenn.S.D.W.

The Las Vegas carnage, for example, might not have been prevented by any of the suggestions I make.That\u2019s true, and there\u2019s no magic wand available. Yet remember that although it is mass shootings that get our attention, they are not the main cause of loss of life. Much more typical is a friend who shoots another, a husband who kills his wife \u2013 or, most common of all, a man who kills himself. Skeptics will say that if people want to kill themselves, there\u2019s nothing we can do. In fact, it turns out that if you make suicide a bit more difficult, suicide rates drop.Here are the figures showing that mass shootings are a modest share of the total, and the same is true of self-defense \u2013 despite what the N.R.A. might have you believe.OTHER CAUSESDEATHS INMASSSHOOTINGS:456VICTIMS KILLINGPERPETRATORS INSELF-DEFENSE:589SHARE OF ALLGUN DEATHS:OTHER CAUSESVICTIMS KILLINGPERPETRATORS INSELF-DEFENSE:589DEATHS INMASSSHOOTINGS:456SHARE OF ALLGUN DEATHS:For skeptics who think that gun laws don\u2019t make a difference, consider what happened in two states, Missouri and Connecticut. In 1995, Connecticut tightened licensing laws, while in 2007 Missouri  eased gun laws.The upshot? After tightening gun laws, firearm homicide rates dropped 40 percent in Connecticut. And after Missouri eased gun laws, gun homicide rates rose 25 percent.Connecticut after 1995 lawtightening licensing requirementsEstimated change in\u201340%Estimated change in\u201315%Missouri after 2007 repealof license requirementsEstimated change in+25%Estimated change in+16%Connecticut after 1995 lawtightening licensing requirementsMissouri after 2007 repealof license requirementsEstimated change inrate of gun homicide\u201340%+25%Estimated change inrate of gun suicide\u201315%+16%One of the lessons of gun research is that we often focus just on firearms themselves, when it may be more productive to focus on who gets access to them. A car or gun is usually safe in the hands of a 45-year-old woman with no criminal record, but may be dangerous when used by a 19-year-old felon with a history of alcohol offenses or domestic violence protection orders.Yet our laws have often focused more on weapons themselves (such as the assault weapons ban) rather than on access. In many places, there is more rigorous screening of people who want to adopt dogs than of people who want to purchase firearms.In these two states, the laws affected access, and although there\u2019s some indication that other factors were also involved in Connecticut (and correlations don\u2019t prove causation), the outcomes are worth pondering.There\u2019s simply a scandalous lack of research on gun violence, largely because the N.R.A. is extremely hostile to such research and Congress rolls over. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did try to research gun violence, Congress responded by cutting its funding.Here is the American toll from four diseases and firearms over the years 1973-2012 \u2013 and the number of National Institutes of Health research grants to explore each problem over that same time.N.I.H. research awardsDiseaseNumber of casesRabies6556Polio266212Cholera400129Diphtheria1,33789Firearmsinjuries3>4 millionNumberof casesDiseaseN.I.H. research awardsRabies6589Polio266129Cholera400212Diphtheria1,33756Firearm Injuries3>4 millionOne approach that could reduce the abuse of guns is better training. As a 13-year-old farm boy in Oregon, I attended a N.R.A. gun safety class (which came with a one-year membership to the N.R.A., making me an N.R.A. alum who despises what that organization has become). These classes can be very useful, and audits found that more than 80 percent cover such matters as checking the gun to see if it\u2019s loaded, keeping one\u2019s finger off the trigger until ready to fire and being certain of the target.Yet the audits also suggest that trainers are more likely to advocate for the N.R.A. or for carrying guns than for, say, safe storage. This is a missed opportunity, for all classes should cover the risks of guns and alcohol, the risks of abuse with suicide and domestic violence, the need for safe storage, and so on. Here\u2019s what researchers found that the gun classes they audited actually covered:NOTDISCUSSEDPERCENT OF CLASSESWHERE DISCUSSEDTrainers encouragedgun carrying81%19Encouragedgun ownership7624Prevent unsupervisedaccess by children7030Encouraged gun usefor self-defense69316040Ricochet6040Theft preventionEncouraged membershipin gun-rights group5644Legal ramifications ofshooting in self-defense55455347Child access lawsRecommendation: whennot in use, store unloaded5050Recommendation: usegun only as last resort4555Young childrenand gun accidents55457030Decision-making in crisesTheft is important sourceof firearms used in crime8020Techniques forde-escalating threats8515Recommendation:report stolen firearms9010Watch for signs of suicidein household members90109010Domestic violence riskTopic discussedPercent of classes where discussedNot discussedTrainers encouraged gun carrying1981%Encouraged gun ownership2476Prevent unsupervised access by children3070Encouraged gun use for self-defense3169Ricochet4060Theft prevention4060Encouraged membership in gun-rights group4456Legal ramifications of shooting in self-defense4555Child access laws4753Recommendation: when not in use, store unloaded5050Recommendation: use gun only as last resort5545Young children and gun accidents5545Decision-making in crises7030Theft is an important source of firearms used in crime8020Techniques for de-escalating threats8515Recommendation: report stolen firearms9010Watch for signs of suicide in household members9010Domestic violence risk9010It may sometimes seem hopeless to make progress on gun violence, especially with the N.R.A. seemingly holding Congress hostage. But I\u2019m more optimistic.Look, we all agree on some kinds of curbs on guns. Nobody believes that people should be able to drive a tank down Main Street, or have an anti-aircraft gun in the backyard. I\u2019ve been to parts of northern Yemen where one could actually buy a tank or an anti-aircraft gun, as well as fully automatic weapons \u2014 and that area\u2019s now embroiled in a civil war \u2013 but fortunately in America we have agreed to ban those kinds of weaponry.So the question isn\u2019t whether we will restrict firearms, but where to draw the line and precisely which ones to restrict.Check out these polling numbers as a basis for action on gun safety:Agree with the following:Householdswith no gunsGun households50%Background checksfor all gun buyers93%96%Preventing mentally ill from buying guns8989Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes8885Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists8284Background checks for private sales and at gun shows7787Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases7289Ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun6779A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence6175New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns5771Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence5681Creating a federal database to track gun sales5480A ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines(10+ bullets)*5277Householdswith no gunsGun householdsAgree with the following:50%93%Background checks for all gun buyers96%89Preventing the mentally ill from buying guns89Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes8885Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists8284Background checks for private sales and at gun shows7787Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases7289A ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun6779A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence6175New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns5771Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence5681Creating a federal database to track gun sales5480A ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines (10+ bullets)*5277Looking ahead, I\u2019m optimistic that there can be progress at the state level, and some of the necessary research funding will come from private foundations. Maybe some police departments will put in orders for smart guns to help create a market.But the real impetus for change will come because the public favors it. In particular, note that 93 percent of people even in gun households favor universal background checks for gun purchases.If you\u2019re wondering how we managed to crank out all these charts and data in the immediate aftermath of the Texas shooting, here\u2019s the secret: We didn\u2019t. We spent weeks gathering the information and preparing the charts, because we knew that there would be a tragedy like this one to make it all relevant.That\u2019s the blunt, damning truth: Friday\u2019s school shooting was 100 percent predictable. After each such incident, we mourn the deaths and sympathize with the victims, but we do nothing fundamental to reduce our vulnerability.Some of you will protest, as President Trump did, that it\u2019s too soon to talk about guns, or that it is disrespectful to the dead to use such a tragedy to score political points. Yet more Americans have died from gun violence, including suicides, since 1970 (about 1.4 million) than in all the wars in American history going back to the Revolutionary War (about 1.3 million). And it\u2019s not just gang-members: In a typical year, more pre-schoolers are shot dead in America (about 75) than police officers are.Yes, making America safer will be hard: There are no perfect solutions. The Second Amendment is one constraint, and so is our polarized political system and the power of the gun lobby. It\u2019s unclear how effective some of my suggestions will be, and in any case this will be a long, uncertain, uphill process.But automobiles are a reminder that we can chip away at a large problem through a public health approach: Just as auto safety improvements have left us far better off, it seems plausible to some gun policy experts that a sensible, politically feasible set of public health steps could over time reduce firearm deaths in America by one-third \u2013 or more than 10,000 lives saved each year.So let\u2019s not just shed tears for the dead, give somber speeches and lower flags.

{"Headline": "A German Banking Merger Remains Far Off", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsIn Greek mythology, Cerberus was the three-headed dog that prevented the dead from leaving the underworld. The arrival of its financial namesake, Cerberus Capital Management, as a major shareholder in the troubled lender Deutsche Bank will be seen by investors as a more positive omen. But any hopes of reviving a merger with its rival Commerzbank, where Cerberus already owns 5 percent, rest with bigger beasts \u2014 including the German government.Investments in public companies are relatively unusual for Cerberus, a hedge fund run by Stephen Feinberg that tends to specialize in distressed debt and private equity. The 3 percent stake in Deutsche Bank that Cerberus disclosed in a regulatory filing on Wednesday is worth close to 980 million euros, or $1.2 billion. That makes it the group\u2019s second-largest direct investment in a listed company, according to Eikon. The Commerzbank stake is No. 3. Add in its remaining shares in the Austrian lender Bawag \u2014 which recently went public more than a decade after being rescued by a Cerberus-led consortium \u2014 and the group\u2019s portfolio of European bank stocks is worth about $3.8 billion. Even for a firm with more than $30 billion under management, that\u2019s an intimidating bet.Cerberus says it thinks the German retail and commercial bank offers \u201cattractive long-term opportunities.\u201d That\u2019s unlikely to be a sufficient explanation for its clients, which could buy Deutsche and Commerzbank shares themselves without paying the firm\u2019s fees.The latest disclosure will fan speculation that Cerberus is pushing to revive merger talks between the banks, Germany\u2019s two largest private-sector lenders; they held abortive talks about a possible tie-up last year. Yet even though the German banking market remains highly fragmented, there are obstacles to a deal \u2014 not least Deutsche\u2019s lengthy integration of its domestic Postbank unit.Besides, other investors have more clout. At Deutsche, Cerberus ranks behind China\u2019s HNA Group, which owns close to 10 percent, and funds controlled by Qatar\u2019s al-Thani family. And any suitor for Commerzbank will have to win over the German government, which still owns more than 15 percent. Rival European lenders, including Italy\u2019s UniCredit and BNP Paribas of France, are also interested. If the two German banks do end up joining forces, Cerberus can do little more than wag its tail in approval.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shell, to Cut Carbon Output, Will Be Less of an Oil Company", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBowing to pressure from shareholders and the Paris international climate accord, Royal Dutch Shell pledged on Tuesday to increase its investment in renewable fuels and to cut its carbon emissions in half by 2050.Shell and other big oil companies have moved only sporadically over the last decade toward greater production of wind and solar energy. Now there are signs of a commitment to take climate change more seriously.In comments to investors, Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, said that from 2018 to 2020, the company\u2019s new-energies division would spend up to $2 billion a year on renewable energy sources like wind, solar and hydrogen power and on electric-car charging stations.Two years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, the world remains far off course from preventing drastic global warming in the decades ahead.\u201cWe will do this in step with society\u2019s drive to align with the Paris goals,\u201d Mr. Van Beurden added, \u201cand we will do it by reducing the net carbon footprint of the full range of Shell emissions, from our operations and from the consumption from our products.\u201dShell, Europe\u2019s largest oil company, said it aimed to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 20 percent by 2035 and by half by 2050. The growing global dependence on natural gas, as a replacement for coal, should help Shell meet its goals since it has made a big investment in producing and trading gas.Environmentalists gave the Shell pledge generally positive reviews.\u201cIt\u2019s good that they are looking in the right direction,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Washington-based Safe Climate Campaign. \u201cThey are ahead of their competitors in recognizing that the days of oil dependence are numbered.\u201dBut he added, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to make progress a lot more quickly than they are projecting in order to protect the climate.\u201dSince the adoption of the 2015 Paris accord, in which most of the countries in the world agreed to set goals to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions, international oil companies have begun to make more public pledges to reduce their carbon releases.Several European oil companies have acknowledged that they would have to leave some carbon resources in the ground. Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, has begun a major shift toward investing in wind power. This month, Shell and seven other oil companies pledged to reduce emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from leaky pipes and wells.Shell is working with BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen to install fast-charging stations on Europe\u2019s highways to make electric cars capable of longer trips. Shell has projected that the expansion of the global electric-car fleet over the next decade will significantly slash gasoline demand.While some energy experts say carbon capture could be a useful tool to control climate change, skeptics say the technology is too expensive to be deployed broadly enough to make a real difference.Mr. van Beurden said the company would measure the accomplishments of the carbon-reduction effort in reports every five years. \u201cThis is a challenge for the whole planet,\u201d he said.Shell\u2019s carbon pledge followed a shareholder resolution, backed by the company, that called on Shell to embrace targets to improve its performance to control climate change.Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This, a group of environmentally minded Shell shareholders that has the support of the Church of England and an assortment of Dutch institutional investors, praised the initiative as \u201can ambitious decision to take leadership in achieving the goals of the Paris climate agreement.\u201dIn the meantime, Shell appears to be making increasing profits from oil and gas. With oil prices and cash flow gradually rising again, Shell announced on Tuesday that it was reviving its all-cash dividend, discarding a program that gave shareholders an option of receiving dividends in shares of stock, which had been depressed in recent years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Push to Ban Rifle \u2018Bump Stocks\u2019 Has Slowed", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Remember bump stocks?But the proposed ban on bump stocks, once hailed as a modest step toward bipartisan compromise on gun safety, may be turning into a cautionary tale of how energetic intentions in the wake of mass shootings can dissipate quickly. As attentions moved elsewhere, the N.R.A. turned against action, and Republican lawmakers decided the devices would be someone else\u2019s problem: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or A.T.F.\u201cRight now everyone\u2019s in a holding pattern, because some people around here have hope that A.T.F. will bail us out,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, who has co-sponsored a bipartisan measure to ban bump stocks.That could happen as soon as next week.Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, announced Monday night that the committee will convene a hearing on bump stocks on Tuesday. The witness list has not been made public, but bureau officials are expected to testify.The desire to ban bump stocks still exists on Capitol Hill, even if it is quieter. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has proposed legislation banning bump stocks and has more than three dozen co-sponsors, all Democrats.\u201cBump stocks\u201d are attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster, almost like machine guns. Twelve of the rifles found in the hotel room of the Las Vegas gunman were fitted with the devices.At least two Republicans, Senators John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said they would be open to a ban, depending on what bureau officials say at next week\u2019s hearing.\u201cIf you believe that automatic weapons should be highly regulated and limited, then why would you be against banning a device that makes a gun an automatic weapon?\u201d Mr. Graham said.But Congress will probably have to take action if lawmakers want bump stocks off the market. The A.T.F. has deemed bump stocks \u201ca firearm part\u201d not subject to regulation under federal laws that, since the 1930s, have sharply limited the manufacture and possession of fully automatic weapons.The N.R.A. was actually the first to put the onus on the A.T.F. In a statement after the Las Vegas shooting, the powerful gun lobby said the bureau should revisit the bump stock issue, and \u201cimmediately review whether these devices comply with federal law.\u201d That was hailed by some as a change for the group, but in fact, the N.R.A. never embraced a ban.\u201cThe day before we put out that statement there were enough votes in the House of Representatives, the pro-gun Republican House of Representatives, to pass a Feinstein-Curbelo type of bill,\u201d Mr. Cox told Mr. Yeager. He went on: \u201cThe truth is we needed to slow down the process and have an educated conversation.\u201dWhat the N.R.A. calls an educated conversation, gun safety advocates regard as slow-walking.\u201cI don\u2019t think the N.R.A. has killed it, but they have certainly put the brakes on,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a national advocacy group. \u201cTheir original statement was a wink and a nod by saying that it should be something that A.T.F. looked at. They knew very well that actually that was an effort to divert attention from legislation.\u201dTo Democrats who support the ban, the bump stocks debate follows a depressingly familiar pattern.\u201cEvery time there\u2019s a gun massacre, we have outrage, grief and silence, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened here,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat. \u201cIt happens again and again and again, and this situation is so obvious. It\u2019s a simple fix.

{"Headline": "Markets Pass Another Milestone, as Investors Remain Fearless", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the longest stock-market booms in history continued its gravity-defying ascent Thursday, with investors cheering the prospect of deep corporate tax cuts and the rollback of government regulations under President Trump.The Dow Jones industrial average eclipsed yet another milestone, closing Thursday above 24,000 for the first time. And the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index logged its 13th straight month of gains, the longest such streak in history.Stock markets have been going up, more or less without interruption, since March 2009, the end of the acute phase of the global financial crisis. This eight-and-a-half-year bull market is now the second-longest in history, behind only the rally that lasted from 1987 until 2000.Investors are embracing Mr. Trump\u2019s pro-corporate presidency, marked by the promise of lower taxes, the installation of former industry executives in key government agencies, and the repeal or relaxation of rules and regulations that have made it hard for some big businesses to expand without fear of interference from Washington.Indeed, the view is taking hold that Mr. Trump, in so aggressively promoting policies aimed to stoke the economy and financial markets, has unleashed animal spirits \u2014 largely absent under President Barack Obama \u2014 that are now reflected in ever rising consumer confidence indicators and a willingness to embrace risk in the stock market.\u201cIt comes down to psychology, and the psychology today is that everything is awesome,\u201d said Charlie Bilello, a stock market historian at Pension Partners. \u201cJobs have grown for 85 straight months, you have growth in corporate earnings, and you have tax cuts.\u201dMore than anything, enthusiasm about life being more pleasant for corporate America is propelling stocks. This week, investors were thrilled by the signs that a normally dysfunctional Washington is coalescing around a tax-cut package that would go straight to the bottom line of businesses and their owners.Of course, there is no guarantee the tax-cut package will become law. That is a potential tripwire for markets.\u201cIf the tax reform doesn\u2019t get done, I think there will be a pretty sharp correction,\u201d said Bruce Van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, one of the largest banking companies in the northeastern United States.Mr. Van Saun said stock markets could plunge as much as 15 percent if the tax cut was derailed in Congress. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite pivotal right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe businessperson has an expectation that this will get done.\u201dThese milestones, of course, are arbitrary. Passing a round number in a particular index isn\u2019t itself significant.But the ease with which the barrier was cleared highlights the extent to which investors are willing to look past geopolitical uncertainty and pricey stock valuations and bet that the market will keep going up.\u201cPeople are assuming this is normal \u2014 but it is not,\u201d Mr. Bilello said. \u201cThe relationship between risk and reward has broken down.\u201dIs this a bubble that\u2019s about to pop? Investment experts are divided.Skeptics point to the fact that many stocks, especially in the technology sector, are at historically high levels. Investors, they note, are relying on debt to amplify their returns. And a tulip-style mania has sent the price of the digital currency Bitcoin soaring.But even more investors are bullish. Sure, valuations are high, but in contrast to 2000, when Silicon Valley was littered with companies without business models, today\u2019s tech behemoths \u2014 including Facebook and Amazon \u2014 are fundamentally sound. And a round of tax cuts could further fatten corporate profits. As for Bitcoin, if it crashes there is no direct reason it should necessarily drag down stocks.Ed Yardeni, an independent stock market strategist, has identified 58 of these small market panics since 2009. This year, he has not seen a single one.\u201cThis is starting to feel like a melt-up,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said, describing a feverish state of a bull market when investors discard all fears. \u201cThe market has climbed a wall of worry, but now it seems as if there is nothing to worry about.\u201dThat, Mr. Yardeni said, is itself something to worry about, because investors are throwing caution to the wind.According to Mr. Bilello, the stock analyst, a typical year will include three or four stock market corrections. In 2017, there have been none. The worst swoon this year was a 3.3 percent fall between March 2 and April 19.Such a relentless \u2014 and smooth \u2014 rise in stocks is very unusual.Several unprecedented factors might be helping the rally, analysts say. For the first time ever, an American president is actively promoting a stock market surge. Mr. Trump has tweeted often about the stock market, including eight times this week alone.A president\u2019s boasting about the market doesn\u2019t mean it should keep going up. But at these high levels, psychology becomes a critical factor that can move stocks higher.That could mean your brother-in-law praising his portfolio at a cocktail party \u2014 or the president of the United States speaking more broadly to his 43 million followers on Twitter.It doesn\u2019t hurt that there has never been a time when the global economy has been growing so strongly while central banks kept interest rates so low.Traditionally, bull markets come to an end when, after a sustained period of growth, inflation forces central banks to raise rates.Now, with inflation stagnant and the lingering anxieties of the 2008 financial crisis fading, investors are not ready to contemplate the end of the party.For example, the latest missile scare from North Korea, after so many previous flare-ups, barely caused investors to bat an eyelid.\u201cI used to call my clients fully invested bears,\u201d said Mr. Yardeni, the investment strategist. \u201cNow they are giddy bulls \u2014 how could they not be?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "$1.5 Billion I.P.O. for Firm Controlled by Putin Ally Tied to Manafort", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Russian energy and aluminum company EN+, which is controlled by a member of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s circle of favored businessmen, said on Friday that it had raised $1.5 billion in an initial public offering seen as a major test of investors\u2019 appetite for Russian assets.The offering may draw attention for using the London Stock Exchange, where listing rules are less stringent than in New York, for a transaction that had the effect of funneling money to a Russian state bank that has faced sanctions in both the United States and the European Union, even though EN+ has not faced sanctions.The offering\u2019s prospectus said that EN+ intended to use $942 million out of the $1.5 billion it raised to pay down a loan from VTB Bank. The offering is intended, it said, to \u201crepay in full the loan provided to it by VTB.\u201dThe United States sanctioned the bank on July 29, 2014, 12 days after a civilian airliner was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, most of whom were Dutch citizens; safety investigators and Dutch prosecutors determined that a Russian antiaircraft missile had hit the plane.The sanctions prohibit Western companies from extending new long-term credit lines to VTB and other Russian banks, but allow loan repayments.Mr. Deripaska, an orphan from a small village in southern Russia, muscled his way into the aluminum business in Siberia in the 1990s. At the time, the industry was in bloody turmoil as organized crime figures and venal local officials fought in what became known as the Aluminum Wars.Despite his humble background, Mr. Deripaska is closely entwined with the Moscow elite. As an example of his proximity to power, analysts of the oligarchy have pointed out that he is married to the step-granddaughter of the late former Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin; Mr. Deripaska has played down the tie as irrelevant to his business activities.Mr. Deripaska was never charged with a crime in Russia over the Aluminum Wars, but the United States has for years denied him a visa, suggesting something unseemly in his ascent in the Siberian aluminum industry. It was in an effort to solve this earlier problem in Washington that a decade ago he reached out to a business partner of Mr. Manafort, Rick Davis, for lobbying.Mr. Manafort and Mr. Deripaska set up an investment company to buy television stations in Ukraine that eventually unraveled in a $19 million lawsuit filed by Mr. Deripaska in the Cayman Islands, court records show. But now, those decade-old ties to Mr. Manafort have become a focus of attention in the Trump-Russia investigation.Addressing concerns about Americans doing business with Kremlin insiders, the sanction law passed by Congress in August stipulates that American officials are to prepare a report on Russian oligarchs by early next year, identifying those deemed close to Mr. Putin for possible sanctions. It is not clear whether Mr. Deripaska is under consideration for inclusion on that list.The potential for new sanctions based on Kremlin ties, long important for survival and success in business in Russia, has the oligarchy on tenterhooks, said Alexey Makarkin, vice president of the Center for Political Technologies, a research institute in Moscow. \u201cThey see a potential threat,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of businessmen are very worried.\u201dStill, the EN+ offering is the latest sign of investors \u2014 while wary of sanctions \u2014 being attracted to Russian companies as the country\u2019s economy gains a firmer footing.EN+\u2019s offering, in particular, comes on the heels of a quiet inflow of foreign money into Russia\u2019s government bond market, where interest rates run about 8 percent. Nonresident investors, who owned only about 5 percent of government bonds at the start of the year, bulked up to to about 30 percent by the fall, an inflow of about $30 billion, according to Alexander Y. Abramov, a professor at the Higher School of Economics at Moscow\u2019s National Research University.\u201cThe budget is under control, the reserve funds are high,\u201d Mr. Abramov said. \u201cThe interest in Russia is in the relatively stable ruble, and no events can be seen in the near future to change that.\u201dEN+ is a producer of hydropower through EN+ Power and of aluminum through Rusal, in which it holds a 48.1 percent stake. EN+ reported revenue of $5.8 billion in the first half of this year. The stock offers investors a chance to own shares in the gigantic dams corralling the power of Siberian rivers like the Yenisei and Angara.The company said it had priced its offering at $14 per global depositary receipt, toward the bottom of its expected range. It said that the offering gave it a market value of $8 billion. Shares of EN+ were trading below the offer price, at $13.82 a share, in conditional trading in London on Friday. The company\u2019s shares are expected to begin trading in Moscow on Wednesday.The EN+ offering comes amid a relative low point in London\u2019s I.P.O. market. Though more money and more deals have been raised on the London Stock Exchange so far this year compared to all of last year \u2014 $5.9 billion has been raised in 25 transactions for the year to date \u2014 that remains far below the levels set in 2013 through 2015, according to data from Thomson Reuters.Despite any concerns about how Britain\u2019s pending exit from the European Union might affect London\u2019s attractions as a listing venue, the London Stock Exchange and the related AIM exchange remain Europe\u2019s busiest market for I.P.O.s.Citigroup, Credit Suisse, J. P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch International, SIB (Cyprus) Limited and VTB Capital acted as joint global coordinators on the EN+ offering.Mark Mazzetti and Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Change on Mortgages Could Shake Up the Housing Market", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Republican tax plan unveiled on Thursday takes aim at the most sacred of cows: the provision that subsidizes homeownership by allowing the deduction of interest on mortgage debt.For most of America, the impact would be minimal. The proposed bill would make the interest deduction available on mortgage debt of up to $500,000 \u2014 half the current ceiling. But that is still more than double the median home price in the United States of roughly $200,000. Fewer than 3 percent of home mortgages are more than $500,000, according to data from CoreLogic.But if the idea holds \u2014 and history suggests that will be difficult \u2014 it will echo loudly through higher-priced cities on the coasts. \u201cThe impact on the market is going to be recognizable,\u201d said Ure R. Kretowicz, chief executive of Cornerstone Communities, a homebuilder in San Diego. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be less incentive to build, and less incentive to buy.\u201dTo understand the vast geographical disparities of the proposal, one need only look at home prices. In the Houston metropolitan area, about 6.5 percent of homes are valued at more than $500,000, according to Zillow. In San Jose, Calif., more than 90 percent are, and in San Diego, Calif., it is 63 percent.The proposed bill has no phase-in period; people who bought homes before Thursday could continue claiming the deduction on a mortgage up to $1 million, but after that, the ceiling is lowered by half. This will raise the overall cost of buying a home, and discourage existing homeowners from moving.On Thursday morning, hours after the proposal was unveiled, Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm based in Seattle, started drafting a memo to its more than 1,000 real estate agents instructing them to ensure that prospective home buyers can still afford homes in their desired price range.Many families would receive a tax cut, but the benefits would be mixed, and some would probably end up paying more.\u201cThere are people writing offers on homes today who have spent the past few days trying to figure out if they can afford a home, and we need to put them on notice that that might change,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, Redfin\u2019s chief executive.\u201cMight\u201d is the operative word here. Many economists from both parties have complained that the mortgage interest deduction is wasteful and unfair. It favors homeowners over renters, rich over poor, and distorts the housing market and even migration patterns by encouraging people to leave smaller urban quarters for bigger and more tax-advantaged homes in the suburbs.Even Mr. Kelman \u2014 a man whose fortunes are directly tied to commissions on homes bought and sold \u2014 said it could be hard to see the usefulness of a deduction that so forcefully favors one group over another.\u201cThe current tax code favors people who are buying a home versus the rest of America,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a captain of industry, I would prefer more tax breaks to help people buy houses, but as a citizen, I realize someone has to pay.\u201d\u201cWe are currently reviewing the details of the tax proposal released today, but at first glance it appears to confirm many of our biggest concerns\u201d about the tax plans making their way through Congress, the statement said. \u201cEliminating or nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and middle-class homeowners at risk, and from a cursory examination this legislation appears to do just that.\u201dEdward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who has long been in favor of reducing the mortgage interest deduction, liked parts of the plan. His main concern was that by retaining the existing deduction for current homeowners, the bill would further reduce the propensity of Americans to move \u2014 not just to a better or more expensive home, but also to cities or states where job opportunities might be brighter.\u201cThis effectively becomes a tax on selling a home,\u201d he said.To be sure, the tax proposal has a lot of variables that make it hard to determine exactly how it would affect any particular family\u2019s tax bill. For instance, the standard deduction would double, a factor that would partly offset the loss of the mortgage interest deduction. But the deductibility of property taxes would be capped at $10,000, another provision that could weigh on the construction and resale of more expensive homes.In any case, between the loss of the mortgage interest deduction and a separate measure to eliminate the deduction of state and local income taxes \u2014 something that would also disproportionately affect the higher-cost cities and states \u2014 the biggest losers will be most heavily concentrated on the coasts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buildings Across U.S. to Light Up Orange for Las Vegas Shooting Victims", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom a soaring skyscraper to the wide span of a bridge, landmarks and buildings around the world are often called upon as torchbearers of grief after mass tragedies.The Eiffel Tower in Paris went dark after a bomb attack in October that killed hundreds of people in Somalia. The spire of 1 World Trade Center in New York was lit up in rainbow colors last year, one of many buildings to reflect the mourning over the dozens killed in a nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla.In an interview, Mr. Rechler said he wanted to keep a dialogue about gun control and gun violence going after the Las Vegas shooting. \u201cI began to realize that maybe this is a way to make a statement to keep it in people\u2019s minds \u2014 that it hasn\u2019t been resolved,\u201d he said.\u201cThese are iconic buildings that are very visible,\u201d Mr. Rechler added. \u201cIt raises awareness.\u201dThe buildings and structures cover the country, from the San Diego Museum of Man, across the Rocky Mountains to the Boulder Courthouse in Colorado, to the Skydance Pedestrian Bridge in Oklahoma City, and further east to the Helmsley Building and 4 Times Square in New York.Illuminating a recognizable part of a city\u2019s skyline in symbolic lights sends a message of solidarity from a community, Mr. Rechler said. The ZACH Theater in Austin, Tex., is one such structure associated with the heart of a hometown.Over the years, the theater has beamed social awareness messages by illuminating its fly tower \u2014 a soaring space in the upper part of the stage \u2014 as it did with blue lights to honor International Day of Peace in September.It will do so again on Wednesday, but this time in orange, said Elisbeth Challener, its managing director.The theater \u201chas been a significant part of the Austin community for 85 years now,\u201d Ms. Challener said in an email. \u201cWe think of ourselves as a meeting tent where the community comes together.\u201dNot everyone Mr. Rechler reached out to in a letter was on board. The organizations behind some buildings agreed to join for one or a few days of the campaign, while those who declined entirely spoke of the sensitivity of taking on a political position, he said.Benjamin Barbera, the curator and operations manager at the Milwaukee County Historical Society, said that starting on Wednesday, orange lights would shine up from below to fill the vaulted windows on the building\u2019s second floor in tribute to the Las Vegas victims.But the lights will probably be swapped out soon after for other coming events and holidays.Still, the show of architectural solidarity was expected to have an impact. The building, built in 1913, is a large, wedge-shaped structure that is visible from downtown, and is highly recognizable since local television stations point their weather cameras at it.\u201cIt will be fairly striking for Milwaukee residents to see we are engaging in this tribute or memorial,\u201d Mr. Barbera said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Tax Plan Diverges From House Version, Highlighting Political Pressures", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe disparate bills show the competing pressures that Republican lawmakers are facing and the calculations that Senate and House leaders are making to ensure passage of the bills through their respective chambers. While both bills share the main priorities of cutting corporate and individual taxes, they diverge on matters of high political sensitivity, particularly for vulnerable House Republicans from high-tax states and for Senate Republicans concerned about adding to the federal budget deficit.Senate staff members said their draft would require changes, likely major ones, to survive procedural rules that allow it to pass on a party-line vote. Those changes could include setting some of the tax cuts to expire after a period of years.Senators Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said the bill did not go far enough in increasing the child tax credit, which rose to $1,650 per child in the Senate version, from $1,600 in the House bill, and would now be available to families making up to $1 million a year, a leap from a current income limit of $110,000. \u201cThe Senate is not going to pass a bill that isn\u2019t clearly pro-family,\u201d they said in a joint statement, \u201cso we look forward to working with our colleagues to get there.\u201d\u201cThe Street definitely felt like there was some connection between tax policy and the market reaction, which was pretty severe,\u201d said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management in New York.FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group, called the Senate\u2019s plan to delay the corporate tax cut \u201cunacceptable.\u201dStill, several business groups and Republican leaders applauded the movement in both chambers. The influential National Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses and had opposed the House bill, reversed course and said it backed both an amended House bill and the Senate version. Other groups shook off the delayed rate cut and embraced the Senate plan.\u201cIt\u2019s been a week of remarkable progress,\u201d said Michael A. Steel, a former House leadership aide who is a managing director for Hamilton Place Strategies, a consultancy in Washington.Republican leaders expressed optimism that they could quickly address concerns and resolve the competing political pressures facing their lawmakers in the Senate and House.\u201cThis will be met with Senate consternation and all kinds of things,\u201d said Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois, who oversees the Ways and Means tax policy subcommittee. \u201cBut when it comes down to it, what we\u2019re on the verge today is winning an argument \u2014 winning an argument about the future of our economy and what our worldview is.\u201dThe bill set for introduction in the Senate Finance Committee includes seven income brackets, scuttling some of the simplicity that House drafters used to sell their bill, which reduced the number of brackets to four.It would keep the bottom tax bracket for individuals at 10 percent, which the House had raised to 12 percent, and would reduce the top rate for high earners to 38.5 percent, down from the current rate of 39.6 percent, which the House had maintained. Like the House bill, the Senate\u2019s version plans to roughly double the standard deduction and expand the child tax credit.The starkest example of the competing priorities is the state and local tax deduction, which is heavily used in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California, which are represented by Democrats in the Senate but have some Republican representatives in the House. The Senate completely eliminates the valuable tax break, which allows taxpayers to deduct state and local income, sales and property taxes. The House bill would still allow individuals to deduct property taxes up to $10,000.Some House Republicans have already rejected that limitation as too strict and the Senate\u2019s complete elimination could further spook those members, whose political future could be imperiled if they pass a plan that actually increases their constituents\u2019 tax bills.\u201cEvery state should be a winner in tax reform, and in my opinion, that would not be the case if the Senate view were to prevail,\u201d said Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey. \u201cI\u2019m not voting for the $10,000, so I\u2019m certainly not voting for zero,\u201d Mr. Lance said.The bill would add $1.5 trillion to federal budget deficits over a decade, without accounting for additional economic growth it might spur, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But Senate staff members suggested that the Finance Committee would need to make changes to ensure it does not lose revenue after 10 years, and thus stays in compliance with the procedural rules that would allow the bill to pass on a party-line vote.In another significant departure from the House bill, the Senate would not create a special, lower top rate for so-called pass-through entities, which are businesses whose profits are distributed to their owners and taxed as individual income. Instead, the Senate would create a 17.4 percent deduction on income taxes for pass-through owners of all income levels, effectively cutting rates both on rich owners and on middle-class small-business owners who would not have benefited from the House\u2019s original lower pass-through rate. For service-providing pass-throughs, it would phase out that benefit for individuals with income above $75,000 and for married couples with income above $150,000.On Thursday, in the face of pushback from fellow Republican lawmakers, small businesses and other industry groups, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, who leads the Ways and Means Committee, unveiled a 29-page amendment making further revisions to the House\u2019s tax plan. The amendment restores the adoption tax credit, which the House tax plan had planned to repeal. It also creates a new, lower tax rate for certain business owners.Under the new provision, the first $37,500 of business income would be taxed at 9 percent, rather than 12 percent, for an unmarried individual earning less than $75,000 through a pass-through business. For a married couple, the dollar amounts would be double.The Senate is also including a provision to prevent large multinational corporations from stashing profits overseas. The bill will propose a new business tax on American and foreign companies \u2014 effectively a minimum tax on their income earned in the United States \u2014 while also levying a 12.5 percent tax on income that American companies receive overseas from their intellectual property.Preliminary estimates indicate the provision would raise more than $130 billion in tax revenue over 10 years to help offset revenue lost from rate cuts, committee staff members said. The original House approach, which would have levied a 20 percent \u201cexcise tax\u201d on payments between American and foreign companies that are affiliated with each other, would have raised an estimated $155 billion in revenue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Expanding Concealed-Carry Gun Rights Advances in House", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Gun rights legislation that would allow concealed-carry permit holders from one state to legally carry their guns to any other state passed a key House panel along party lines on Wednesday and appeared to be headed for a vote on the floor of the House.The measure is the first gun-related legislation to move in Congress since two of the most deadly mass shootings in United States history, in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas, and would hand a long-sought victory to gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Association.Representative Richard Hudson, Republican of North Carolina and the bill\u2019s original sponsor, called the measure \u201ca simple, common sense solution\u201d and \u201cone of the most important pro-Second Amendment measures in Congress.\u201dDemocrats on the committee, along with gun control advocates and big city law enforcement officials, put up fierce opposition, warning that the bill would have disastrous effects on public safety in states and cities with more restrictive concealed carry laws. The bill, they said, tramples the rights of states to determine their own laws, but a series of amendments offered by Democrats to halt it failed.\u201cEssentially, we are telling states who are responsible in the requirements that they place on their concealed-carry permits that that doesn\u2019t matter anymore,\u201d said Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California.The measure, which has been co-sponsored by 210 Republicans and three Democrats, was expected to win passage in the Republican-controlled House as soon as next week. But its fate in the Senate is far less certain. Republicans control only a narrow majority in that chamber, where any legislation would need to pick up Democratic votes.The measure also allows visitors to national parks, wildlife refuges and other federally administered lands to legally carry concealed firearms. And Republicans passed an amendment to the bill that would allow off-duty police officers and qualified retired officers to carry guns in school zones.Wednesday\u2019s debate revisited arguments that have grown familiar in recent years as Congress has deadlocked over how, if at all, to address a series of increasingly deadly mass shootings. The committee, one of the House\u2019s most ideologically divided and largely split between Republicans from suburbs and rural areas and mostly urban Democrats, showed that little has changed in the wake of the Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs shootings, which took dozens of lives and left hundreds injured.House Republicans, who briefly paused efforts to expand gun owners\u2019 rights after the deadly shootings, said on Wednesday that the concealed-carry legislation was a logical and necessary extension of the right of Americans to bear arms.\u201cI do not believe that my right to protect myself, to protect my family, should end at the state line,\u201d said Representative John Rutherford, a Florida Republican and retired sheriff. \u201cMy constitutional rights do not end at the Florida state line.\u201dDemocrats repeatedly and aggressively questioned the majority\u2019s priorities, pleading for a hearing on other gun control measures they said would help reduce violence.\u201cThree hundred ninety-seven mass killings since we entered Congress and what have we done?\u201d asked Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland.Gun control advocates lined up against the concealed carry measure, along with law enforcement officials in major cities like New York and Los Angeles, where strict gun control laws aimed at handguns have long been a tool for the police and prosecutors.Eleven states grant permits to people who have not undergone safety training. Twenty states allow permits for people convicted of violent crimes, and a dozen do not require any kind of permit or license to carry a concealed firearm.In New York City, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, and James P. O\u2019Neill, the police commissioner, have been arguing for months that the bill would in essence impose the lax gun laws of southern states like Arkansas or South Carolina on a densely populated city with vastly different problems. Mr. Vance has spearheaded an effort among big city prosecutors to the stop the bill.James C. McKinley Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the Tax Bill Would Look Like for 25,000 Middle-Class Families", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nEach dot represents one household in the middle class in 2018The tax bill being debated in the Senate this week would affect nearly every American. Numerous analyses have estimated the average impact of the bill on household finances, and advocates on both sides have produced examples of \u201ctypical\u201d families that would win or lose under the plan.Such analyses, however, tend to gloss over the remarkable diversity of Americans\u2019 financial situations. In truth, there is no \u201ctypical\u201d American household. Even families that look similar on the surface can differ in ways that radically alter their situation come tax season.A couple of things should jump out right away. First, there are more dots on the right side of the chart than the left \u2014 more households would get a tax cut than a tax increase. (The chart represents the impact in 2018; the situation looks considerably different in 2027, after many provisions of the bill are set to expire.)Second, the dots are all over the place. Look at the line of households earning about $100,000 a year. On the far left of the chart, there\u2019s a household that would pay more than $4,000 more in taxes under the Senate plan. On the far right is a household that earns almost the same amount but that would pay $4,000 less under the plan. (All figures are relative to what each household would pay under existing tax law.)If you want to understand the tax bill, it helps to understand what factors separate those two families, and all the other families in between.Households that take the standard deductionHouseholds that itemizeThe United States tax code is full of specialized deductions \u2014 for charitable donations, mortgage interest, medical expenses and lots more. But about three-quarters of middle-class taxpayers don\u2019t have to worry about any of that \u2014 they take the so-called standard deduction, which replaces most of those specialized tax breaks with a single lump sum.The Senate bill would roughly double the standard deduction: to $12,000 for an individual or $24,000 for married couples. As a result, most middle-class households that take the standard deduction now would get a tax cut under the bill in 2018, and almost none would get a tax increase.The story is very different for the roughly one-quarter of middle-class families that itemize deductions. The Senate bill would eliminate some popular tax breaks, including deductions for state and local taxes. As a result, households that take those deductions now could lose out. In total, about 40 percent of households that itemize their deductions would pay more in 2018 under the Senate bill \u2014 in some cases a lot more.Married with no childrenMarried with one childMarried with two childrenThe Senate bill would affect different types of families differently. It\u2019s easier to see how the various provisions would play out when we sort the data based on the number of children in each household.Start with the chart on the left, which shows just married couples with no children. There\u2019s still plenty of variation, but now some clear patterns emerge. For the roughly 70 percent of these couples that take the standard deduction, the G.O.P. bill has three main changes that matter: the doubling of the standard deduction (which helps them), the elimination of the personal exemption (which hurts them) and the revision of the income tax brackets (which would lower tax rates at many income levels).The heavy diagonal line on the chart reflects the most common situation for these couples. Those earning $40,000 \u2014 roughly the bottom of the middle class in our definition \u2014 get about a $300 tax cut. Higher earners get a bigger cut, in absolute terms, because they have more income that\u2019s subject to the reduced tax rate. (The fainter vertical line represents mostly older people. Much Social Security income isn\u2019t taxed, so they benefit from the higher standard deduction, but many aren\u2019t affected by the lower tax rate.)Pay little in state and local taxesPay a moderate amount of state and local taxesPay a lot in state and local taxesOne of the bill\u2019s most significant changes would be the elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes. More than 40 million households wrote off a combined $350 billion in state and local income and sales taxes in 2015, according to the I.R.S., and 38 million households deducted close to $200 billion in property taxes. Both deductions would disappear under the Senate bill. (The House version of the bill would get rid of the deduction for income and sales taxes but would cap \u2014 not eliminate \u2014 the property-tax deduction.)The charts above group households into three broad categories. The group on the left deducts little in state and local taxes; many deduct nothing at all and instead take the standard deduction. The group on the right deducts $4,400 or more in state and local taxes (including income, sales and property taxes), and as a result, many would pay more under the Senate bill.Many households most affected by the loss of the state and local tax deduction live in coastal states such as New York, California and Connecticut. Those states have high tax rates; they also tend to vote for Democrats. In Connecticut, for example, more than 40 percent of taxpayers deducted either income or sales taxes in 2015, compared with just 28 percent in the United States as a whole.As the charts show, households that take large state and local deductions also tend to be relatively wealthy. That\u2019s partly because richer households tend to take bigger deductions across the board. But it\u2019s also a reflection of the higher cost of living \u2014 and correspondingly higher incomes \u2014 in many coastal states.Excluding impact of corporate tax cutsIncluding impact of corporate tax cutsUntil now, we\u2019ve been focusing on the impact of the Senate bill on people\u2019s taxes in 2018, when most households would get at least a small tax cut. But the situation would look very different a decade from now. That\u2019s because in order to reduce the cost of the bill, its authors set essentially all of the individual tax cuts \u2014 the doubled standard deduction, the more generous child credit, the lower tax rates \u2014 to expire after 2025. But one provision that\u2019s bad for taxpayers \u2014 changing the measure of inflation used for many tax calculations \u2014 would not expire. As a result, two-thirds of middle-class households would get a tax increase in 2027, and none \u2014 zero percent \u2014 would get a tax cut. (That\u2019s what\u2019s shown in the left-hand chart above.)Those figures, however, consider only how the bill would affect personal income taxes. Starting in 2019, the bill would also cut taxes on businesses. Unlike the personal tax provisions, the business tax cuts would not expire.Congress\u2019s in-house tax analyst, the Joint Committee on Taxation, estimates that about 25 percent of the cuts to corporate taxes would go to workers in the form of higher incomes. Using that and some other assumptions from the committee, we can allocate the corporate tax cuts to individual households, which is what we show in the chart on the right above. A bit under half of middle-class households would get a tax cut \u2014 or, technically, an increase in after-tax income \u2014 under these assumptions, and a bit more than half would see their after-tax income go down compared with under existing law. Both the cuts and the increases would generally be small for middle-class households, although the gains could be significant for some wealthy households.Compared with the 2018 analysis, conclusions about the effects of the tax bill in 2027 are highly uncertain. On the one hand, Republicans argue that Congress is unlikely to allow tax cuts to expire in 2026 as planned, so the middle class might do better than this analysis suggests. On the other, many liberal economists argue that the Joint Committee on Taxation is too generous in its assumptions about how much workers would benefit from the corporate tax cuts. Our analysis makes no effort to account for the broader economic effects of either the tax cuts or of the extra debt that the government would have to take on to pay for them. It also doesn\u2019t account for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, a provision that would have a much bigger impact in 2027 than in 2018.The tax analysis is confined exclusively to middle-class households, defined as households that earn two-thirds to two times household-size adjusted median income. That\u2019s roughly $40,000 to $125,000 for a family of four, or about $30,000 to $90,000 for a couple. For singles, the middle class starts at about $20,000, although to make the charts more readable, we aren\u2019t showing households earning less than $40,000.

{"Headline": "E.U. Ministers Approve Venezuela Arms Embargo", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ministers also established the legal framework for sanctions, including travel bans and the freezing of assets, against government officials, a step the Trump administration has taken against dozens of Venezuelan government officials, including Mr. Maduro.Opposition leaders in Venezuela announced last week that they planned to resume stalled face-to-face negotiations with the Maduro administration this week in the Dominican Republic. The opposition said it was intent on establishing conditions for a fair and democratic presidential election next year.The European Union\u2019s foreign ministers cited those elections, which were scarred by allegations of fraud and electoral trickery, as an impetus for its decision on Monday, and they called on the Maduro administration to allow \u201ca comprehensive and independent audit\u201d of the results.\u201cThese developments have accentuated the political polarization in the country,\u201d the group said.Also on Monday, the government, seeking to ease Venezuela\u2019s economic crisis and avoid a default, began talks in Caracas on renegotiating a crushing foreign debt that has drained its treasury of money to import food and medicine.Though many major investors around the world balked at an invitation to the meeting, citing safety concerns amid the capital\u2019s violence and the possibility they could run afoul of American sanctions, scores of bondholders or their representatives attended the hourlong gathering. It was held at a regal government building here known as the White Palace.But government officials at the meeting presented no firm proposals to attendees, Reuters reported, and no future gatherings were scheduled. That left bondholders and analysts struggling to figure out whether the Maduro administration had any sort of strategy to resolve its debt problem.\u201cI don\u2019t think they have a fully constructed plan,\u201d said Diego Ferro, an executive at Greylock Capital, an investment house that holds Venezuelan bonds though its representatives did not attend the meeting. \u201cTo organize this meeting in Caracas at this moment seemed to be more of a political statement on their part than to have a really constructive dialogue. Nothing should really surprise.\u201dMr. Maduro has said he hopes to restructure Venezuela\u2019s $63 billion in bonds, most of them issued by the government and the state-run oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa. He has made payments on the country\u2019s foreign debt a cornerstone of his economic policy, even at the expense of food, medicine and other critical imports for the country.Over the weekend, Mr. Maduro reiterated that commitment, according to news services, declaring that Venezuela would \u201cnever\u201d declare default.All told, Venezuela owes more than $120 billion, including the bond debts, oil payments to Russia and China and outstanding claims by oil service companies.Further complicating the economic picture for Venezuela, its crude production has dropped below two million barrels per day, to its lowest point in 28 years. Oil is the government\u2019s main source of revenue.The economic and political pressures on Venezuela were also underscored on Monday at the United Nations, where the Security Council held an informal meeting to discuss the deteriorating situation in Venezuela and its threat to regional stability.Notably absent was Venezuela\u2019s ambassador, Rafael Ram\u00edrez, who held a news conference in which he denounced the meeting as \u201ca hostile act\u201d by the United States and a violation of Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty.\u201cWe will resolve our issues on our own and in peace,\u201d he declared in a Twitter post.China and Russia, both Security Council members, refused to attend, suggesting that any push by the United States and others for Council action on Venezuela would probably meet strong resistance.Separately in New York, a derivatives industry trade organization met to discuss Venezuela\u2019s debt situation and whether late bond payments earlier this month from Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela constituted a so-called credit event. Such a determination by the group, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, might allow debt holders to collect on a kind of insurance against default known as credit default swaps.The group postponed its decision until Tuesday.Kirk Semple reported from Caracas, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump and Ryan Versus the Little People", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat, after all, is the main thrust of the bill. It hugely favors the wealthy over the middle class, which is pretty much always true of Republican proposals. But it\u2019s not just about favoring high incomes: It also systematically favors people who live off their assets, especially inherited wealth, over the little people \u2014 that is, poor shlubs who actually have to work for a living.To get an idea why, consider four hypothetical taxpayers and how they would fare under the G.O.P. bill.But what about owners of small businesses? Under current law, their business income is \u201cpassed through\u201d to their personal income, and taxed accordingly. The Cut Cut Cut Act would instead allow people with such income to pay only 25 percent, a big tax break for those with high incomes. But this raises obvious possibilities for abuse, with every well-paid professional reclassifying herself or himself as a business.And since federal spending is dominated by programs \u2014 Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 that benefit the middle and working classes, the end result of this tax bill would be to leave most working Americans, even those who wouldn\u2019t face direct tax increases, worse off, all for the benefit of a tiny minority, especially those who haven\u2019t even worked for their wealth.You might wonder how Republicans imagine that they can get away with this. But anyone who has paid attention to U.S. politics knows the answer. First, they will lie, unashamedly, about what their bill actually does. Second, they will try to distract working-class voters by stoking racial animosity. That didn\u2019t work too well in Tuesday\u2019s elections, but they\u2019ll keep on trying.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Private School Tax Break in the Middle-Class Tax Bill", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyIf we are to believe the Republican policymakers who control the current attempt to overhaul our tax system, a big point of the exercise is to help the middle class. So how best to explain a possible tax break of more than $30,000 per child for wealthy families who send their kids to private school?That number is the potential net new tax savings, under the House tax plan, for parents who deposit a large amount of money when their kids are born. They would get that benefit by using the money for children starting private school in kindergarten and attending through high school.But then comes the big change: Elementary and high school expenses of up to $10,000 per year would become \u201cqualified\u201d expenses for 529 plans. Translation? You could pull $10,000 each year out of your 529 account for private school and avoid paying taxes on any previous growth. There are no income limits on who can use 529 plans, and you would be able to keep right on saving for college as well.The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this will reduce federal revenue by $600 million between 2018 and 2027.So how did this proposal come to pass? Like many things that are important to relatively few people but find their way into large bills nevertheless, it\u2019s kind of a long story.The rules, however, capped annual contributions at $2,000. That limited how much of a benefit you could get over 15 years or so by avoiding capital gains taxes that you would have otherwise paid in a different savings vehicle that offered investments in stocks and bonds.So what would it mean to add private school benefits to 529 plans? Take a wealthy family in the highest tax bracket. It has a newborn baby, and through some combination of gifts and its own savings, it opens a 529 plan with $200,000 and never deposits another dime.If the money grows at 6 percent annually, that family could take out the $10,000 each year, avoiding $2,380 in taxes annually. If it did that for 13 years (kindergarten through 12th grade), it would save $30,940 in taxes. Plus, according to numbers that Vanguard ran for me, it would still have enough left over after high school ($370,717) to pay for many pricey private colleges in full, as long as tuition inflation there ran no more than 3 percent annually.And once college began, the family could withdraw as much as the entire annual cost of college and related expenses (not just $10,000), avoiding taxes on any gains all the while.It sure seemed to me \u2014 someone who has used the Coverdells for private school tuition, but who worries about being able to save a decent chunk for college while also using 529s for any future K-12 tuition for two kids \u2014 that this was a giant gift to a tiny slice of the wealthiest people in America.That can be worth a couple of hundred dollars right then and there, and if the House bill passes, the same opportunity will exist for families 13 times before college. You may even be able to do this with money you have borrowed.Not all wealthy families with children in private school would take advantage of a provision like this. Some have financial advisers who steer them away from 529s, because they think that the investments are unsophisticated or that the accounts have too many restrictions. Other individuals don\u2019t want to tie up that much capital in savings that could be used to smooth over rough patches if their income is variable.Then there are still large numbers of people who find 529s \u2014 with their dozens of state-based iterations and differing state tax benefits and menus of investments \u2014 confusing to the point of absurdity.For every other 1 percenter with a family, however, this sure seems like an extraordinary gift. And it will be fascinating \u2014 and revealing \u2014 to see how long it remains under the big tax Christmas tree.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Says G.O.P. Tax Bill Wouldn\u2019t Benefit Him. That\u2019s Not True.", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SensePresident Trump likes to argue that the tax-reform legislation hurtling through Congress this week will protect low- and middle-income households, \u201cnot the wealthy and well connected.\u201d He puts himself forward as Exhibit A.So surely at least a few of the most egregious loopholes that benefit Mr. Trump and real estate developers like him will be closed.Not in the slightest.In fact, the proposals seem almost tailor-made to enrich the president and people like him.\u201cCommercial real estate came out essentially unscathed,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative advocacy group. Real estate developers \u201cdidn\u2019t lose anything they care about,\u201d and they got even more breaks, like a shorter depreciation schedule in the Senate tax bill, Mr. Holtz-Eakin pointed out.Mr. Trump still has not released his tax returns, so it\u2019s impossible to know to what extent he would personally benefit from the legislation. But there\u2019s little doubt that he would.\u201cLower pass-through rates and the repeal of the alternative minimum tax \u2014 those two alone are so hugely beneficial to Trump that I have trouble imagining any way that he wouldn\u2019t come out ahead,\u201d said Steve Wamhoff, senior fellow for federal tax policy at the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. (The pass-through reference involves income that typically comes from partnerships and limited liability companies.)Not only that, but rental income, royalty payments and licensing fees \u2014 some of the president\u2019s major sources of income \u2014 get especially favorable treatment under new rates for pass-through income. (Mr. Trump\u2019s assets include more than 500 pass-through partnerships and limited liability companies.)As many people have pointed out, the \u201cwealthy and well connected,\u201d as Mr. Trump described them, will benefit disproportionately from the proposed legislation. That\u2019s in large part because the big tax cuts for corporations heavily favor shareholders, and the wealthy own a disproportionate amount of stocks and other assets.Many wealthy taxpayers will also benefit from the lower rates on pass-through income, since such income accrues overwhelmingly to the wealthiest taxpayers.Even among that affluent population, the additional breaks that would benefit Mr. Trump and a small cadre of real estate developers like him stand out.Consider one of the most criticized loopholes in the current tax code: the exemption from taxation of so-called like-kind exchanges. That has enabled owners of property to sell at a large capital gain but defer any tax as long as they use the proceeds to buy some other property.The House and Senate bills eliminate the favored treatment of like-kind exchanges \u2014 except for \u201creal property.\u201d Owners of paintings, for example, would not be able to sell a Cezanne and buy a Van Gogh tax-free. But owners of commercial real estate could keep flipping the properties until they die without ever paying any capital gains tax. (And if the estate tax is abolished, the gains might go untaxed forever.)One of the biggest reforms in the tax legislation would limit the ability of businesses to deduct interest payments from their taxable income while giving them the ability to expense capital improvements (rather than depreciate them). Commercial real estate interests had howled over this provision, because they rely so heavily on debt to finance their operations.The list goes on. In both the House and Senate legislation, only certain kinds of income are eligible for the lower pass-through rates. Short-term capital gains, dividends, interest and annuity payments do not qualify.But rent, royalties and licensing fees \u2014 all similar in character to the disallowed income \u2014 weren\u2019t included in that list, Mr. Rosenthal pointed out. All remain eligible for the lower pass-through rate.\u201cI call them the Donald J. Trump exceptions,\u201d since the president receives so much income from those sources, Mr. Rosenthal said. \u201cTrump will get a huge windfall on his rental, license and royalty income,\u201d he predicted.A major way that losses are generated in real estate ventures is through depreciation, which is supposed to reflect the way that assets lose value over time. But a well-maintained building typically gains value (and maintenance costs are all deductible). So most depreciation charges lead to what the president might call \u201cfake\u201d losses, and they might never be recouped, because taxes on any sale can be deferred through like-kind exchanges.The House and Senate rejected proposals to curb the use of such noncash charges. Instead, the Senate, by shortening the depreciation schedule for commercial property to 25 from 39 years, would accelerate the rate at which real estate investors can take such deductions.From what little is known of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, he used losses to offset virtually all of his taxable income for years by generating something called net operating loss carry-overs. Under both the House and Senate versions, such carry-overs can be used to offset only 90 percent of a person\u2019s taxable income (and, in the Senate version, 80 percent after 2022, which reverts to 90 percent after 2025 if revenue targets are met) in a given year. That is a modest improvement over the existing code, but it still allows for the full offset over time.One of the biggest benefits for the president, and for other wealthy taxpayers with high deductions, is the proposed repeal of the alternative minimum tax. Thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s leaked 2005 tax return, we know that the only reason he paid federal tax of 24 percent of his taxable income that year was because of the alternative minimum tax. (Without it, he would have paid just 4 percent.)The rationale for eliminating the alternative minimum tax is that such a backup system should not be necessary if the tax code is fundamentally fair and eliminates all the loopholes that made it possible for high-income taxpayers to escape taxation in the first place. As should be obvious by now, this legislation expands such loopholes.\u201cIt\u2019s surprising to me that no real attempt was made to close any of these loopholes,\u201d said Mr. Wamhoff, given that \u201cvirtually every nonpartisan tax expert agrees that commercial real estate is already so favored by the tax code.\u201d Even Democrats, for the most part, have remained silent.Perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be so surprising, given that the president is the real-estate-investor-in-chief, and that his personal interests align with one of the country\u2019s most powerful lobbies.\u201cReal estate interests are very powerful when it comes to the tax laws,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got bipartisan support, and it\u2019s been that way forever.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misspelled the given name of a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. He is Stephen Wamhoff, not Steven (but his preference is Steve).videoAdvertisement"}

(Time Inc.\u2019s digital ad revenues passed $500 million last year \u2014 a number that Time Inc. execs like to compare to BuzzFeed, which did about half of that in the same time frame.)The aim is to reduce the fund\u2019s exposure to a drop in oil and gas prices. These holdings make up 6 percent or about $37 billion of the fund\u2019s benchmark equity index.\u201cWhile the central bank said the view was not based on any prediction of future oil and gas commodity prices or the \u2018sustainability\u2019 of the sector, the move will be closely watched given the fund\u2019s clout in global equity markets.\u201d\u2014 Amie TsangPrevious mishaps have included Yahoo in 2008 overstating the support for its chairman.

{"Headline": "As Wild Salmon Decline, Norway Pressures Its Giant Fish Farms", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySKJERJEHAMN, Norway \u2014 As a teenager, Ola Braanaas kept a few fish in an aquarium in his bedroom. Now, at 55, he keeps a lot more of them: around 1.2 million just in one windswept spot off the stunning coast of Norway, a giant farm with six large, circular structures each containing around 200,000 fish.Once a rarity on global dinner tables, salmon is a staple today, thanks to a fish farming industry that has expanded at breakneck speed in recent decades, including in Norway, where in 2016 around 1.18 million metric tons were produced.But now, Norwegian fish farmers face new curbs designed to protect the country\u2019s stocks of wild salmon, rules that have ignited anger from the industry and its opponents, prompting threats of court challenges from both sides.The wild Norwegian salmon are members of an ancient species that, early in its life cycle, heads down river, swimming through Norway\u2019s famous fjords, and out to saltwater feeding grounds, before returning to their native rivers to spawn.In recent years, however, the wild salmon population has more than halved, partly because of the spread of sea lice, parasites that feast on the mucus and skin of the fish before moving on to the muscle and fat, making the fish vulnerable to infections and sometimes killing them.Sea lice, like the salmon, have existed in the ocean for eons but have emerged as a huge problem for the fish farms, where they multiply in such numbers that they kill farmed fish and pose a risk to young wild salmon as they pass the holding pens on their way to the open sea.The lice problem is so bad that the worldwide supply of salmon on sale, the overwhelming majority of which is farmed, fell significantly last year, with Norway, the largest producer, especially hard hit.To contain the problem, a system came into force in Norway on Oct. 15, under which farms in regions that are judged to severely threaten wild salmon numbers will have their production frozen and potentially, in future years, cut. If the lice are brought under control, then output can be increased.Mr. Braanaas, the owner of Firda Seafood, says that there are already rules in place to control the lice, and that he will go to court if he is ordered to reduce production because of problems from other farms in his region. It is, he says, a \u201cStasi system,\u201d a reference to the secret police of East Germany.But there are other problems, too, beyond sea lice. Rune Jensen, the head of SalmonCamera, says that wild fish, like cod, congregate around salmon farms, attracted by the food there. These predators eat the young wild salmon in greater numbers than normal as they make their way out to sea, or sometimes even force them into the farm cages.But activists say the biggest threat is the genetic impact of farmed fish that escape their pens, reproduce with wild salmon and produce offspring ill-equipped to survive.Over the last decade, fish farmers have reported more than 200,000 salmon escaping on average each year, though the real figures may be as much as four times higher than that in the years 2005 to 2011, according to one study.The impact has been observed by Norway\u2019s anglers. Few people know the fishing grounds of the Dale River as well as Inge Sandven, the head of the Dale Hunters\u2019 and Anglers\u2019 Club. In just 15 minutes at one river pool, set against a spectacular backdrop of tree-covered hills, he had three bites but no catches.Then, the rod strained, and he slowly reeled in a small, shiny, olive brown salmon weighing a couple of pounds. Just by looking at it, as it thrashed in a net, Mr. Sandven could tell a lot about the fish: It was male and had probably spent three years in this river and one winter at sea.But what he could not say: whether it was a pure wild salmon.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to tell. It looks good, but I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Sandven said, when asked if it might have farmed salmon genes. \u201cIt\u2019s a 50/50 chance \u2014 that\u2019s the experience of this year,\u201d he added, before releasing his catch.Mr. Sandven knows this because he supervises a wild salmon hatchery, and takes DNA samples from fish caught in this river before they are used for breeding. Recently, around half have failed the wild salmon purity test.The genetic makeup is important, said Alv Arne Lyse, a fisheries biologist at the Norwegian Association of Hunters and Anglers. In farm fish pens, where there are no predators, the most aggressive salmon are the most successful, since the only concern is to get as much food as possible.Escaped salmon then pass that trait on to hybrid wild salmon, who are then, to mix metaphors, like lambs to the slaughter out in the open seas.That is because in the ocean, awareness is far more important for survival than aggressiveness, as danger lurks all around.\u201cThe offspring of farmed fish are more aggressive, but when they go out in the sea they have very high mortality,\u201d Mr. Lyse said, adding that they also often lack the homing instinct to return to a specific river, since they were spawned in commercial hatcheries.While previously pollution was a huge problem in aquaculture, he said, now \u201cthe only threats that are not under control are the genetic impact from escaped fish and sea lice.\u201dThe fish farmers argue that they play a vital role in feeding the planet, and that they produce a crop worth $8 billion annually to Norway, accounting for about 8 percent of the country\u2019s exports.The Norwegian government already has rules requiring farms to test the quantity of sea lice in pens and to take action if they exceed the limits.Marine Harvest uses so-called cleaner fish that feed on sea lice to help combat the problem. It is also investing in new techniques designed to eliminate the risk of escapes of farmed salmon and to cut lice numbers.These include novel ideas such as the \u201cegg\u201d \u2014 a solid oval-shaped pen, yet to be constructed, which is enclosed, preventing any risk of salmon escaping, and making it harder for sea lice to enter and spread.Along with his fellow Green Warriors, Mr. Oddekalv argues that the scale of fish farming in Norway is unsustainable, and that huge volumes of uneaten feed and fish excrement pollute the seabed. Over the years farmers have been criticized for using antibiotics in fish feed, something that is now barred in Norway, though additives designed to curb the lice also find their way into the food chain, Mr. Oddekalv argues.\u201cIf people knew this they wouldn\u2019t eat salmon,\u201d he said, describing the farmed fish as \u201cthe most toxic food in the world.\u201dIn a statement, Norway\u2019s fisheries minister, Per Sandberg, described the new system for dealing with the sea lice problem as \u201cfair\u201d and constructed on a \u201csafe legal basis.\u201dHe said that \u201cas in all science, there are knowledge gaps,\u201d but that scientists agree that lice have a negative impact on wild salmon and that it would \u201cbe wrong not to act at all, due to some gaps in our knowledge.\u201dAt his home, which can be reached only by boat, Mr. Braanaas conceded that the Norwegian salmon farming industry has \u201cmade a lot of mistakes.\u201d But he insisted there were many fewer problems there than in other parts of the world, like Chile, where he said that regulation is lighter and \u201cgreed takes over.\u201dAs a self-made businessman whose parents mortgaged their home to help finance his first fish farm, Mr. Braanaas is proud of the company he has built and of the employment it provides in a remote part of Europe. And he believes some of its critics are motivated by a sentimental reverence for one particular species of fish.\u201cIn India, they have the holy cow,\u201d he said, reflecting over a beer. \u201cIn Norway, it\u2019s the sacred salmon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A decade after discontinuing Aibo, Sony said on Wednesday that it was bringing the mechanical canine back as an experiment in cuddly, consumer-friendly artificial intelligence.Investors are giving Sony another chance, too.Shares in the electronics and entertainment giant rose to their highest level in nearly a decade, a day after Sony projected what would be its largest-ever annual operating profit.Sony lost money for years on once-profitable products like televisions \u2014 which it could no longer make cheaply enough to keep up with plummeting prices \u2014 while failing to capitalize on the digital revolution that turned Apple and its ecosystem of connected products into a global powerhouse.The Japanese company\u2019s recent upswing, still a work in progress, is being driven by a mix of old and new businesses. Reorienting the company took years \u2014 and billions of dollars in restructuring charges \u2014 but the transformation is paying off, analysts say.It remains a bit player in smartphones, the product that made Apple\u2019s fortune, but sustained demand for the devices has enriched Sony regardless. It is a major supplier of image-sensing circuits used in smartphone cameras, including the iPhone\u2019s, which means it has shared, to some degree, in its competitor\u2019s success.Sony has also closed or sold off costly factories. It still sells televisions under its brand name, but \u2014 like Apple \u2014 its focus now is on design and marketing rather than production, which is increasingly left to contractors.All of that added up to what Atul Goyal, an analyst at the securities firm Jefferies, called \u201cblowout results\u201d for Sony\u2019s latest quarter.Sony also upgraded its profit forecast for the full financial year, which ends in March, from \u00a5500 billion to \u00a5630 billion, which would be an all-time high.Investors piled into Sony\u2019s shares on Wednesday in response. The stock closed up 11 percent at \u00a54,918, the highest level since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008. Japanese share prices have been buoyant across the board lately, and the country\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 index has reached multidecade highs while Wall Street and other markets have also surged.

{"Headline": "As Bitcoin Scrapes $10,000, an Investment Boom Like No Other", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Digital gold. The new tulip mania. A virtual currency.Whatever you want to call it, Bitcoin is on an extraordinary run, with the price of a single Bitcoin crossing $10,000 on some exchanges for the first time on Monday \u2014 less than two months after it crossed $5,000 for the first time.It is a bull market with few precedents in recent investing history. The Dow Jones industrial average, in its biggest year, 1915, went up 82 percent, or one-tenth as much as Bitcoin has gone up this year. Amazon\u2019s red-hot stock is up only one-fifteenth as much as Bitcoin this year.These mainstream investors have not just been the libertarian-minded programmers who helped Bitcoin survive its rocky first seven years, after the mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto released it in 2009.On American exchanges, the price was hovering around $9,700 on Monday.The untethered price increase has, to a degree, proved their point, suggesting that this is an investment tied to few real-world fundamentals.But each time the skeptics have come forward, investors have defied them and bought more Bitcoins at higher prices. On Sunday, more than $5 billion was traded on Bitcoin exchanges, according to the data site Coinmarketcap.com \u2014 a greater volume than what many American stock exchanges see on a normal day.Believers in the Bitcoin technology, which is backed by a new kind of computer network, have argued that what we are seeing is the formation of a new asset class that could join stocks, bonds and physical commodities in the investment portfolios of ordinary people.If this is a new digital gold, today\u2019s extraordinary prices still leave the total supply of Bitcoins in the world at a value that is only one-sixtieth of all the real gold in the world.But even aficionados have been dumbstruck by just how quickly the price has gone up in recent months.\u201cWhile there has been a slew of bullish news for Bitcoin of late, the rapidity of the ascent to $10,000 has taken many of us by surprise,\u201d said Chris Burniske, an investor and a co-author of the book \u201cCryptoassets.\u201dOr as one trending comment on the Reddit social network put it: \u201cThis is officially madness. I am going to prepare myself for a large correction.\u201dIn many places, this trading is happening on exchanges with little regulatory oversight or transparency. This has given rise to fears that a problem at one of the exchanges could trigger a panicked run on Bitcoin, something that is not unlikely given the relative inexperience of many of the new investors.A steep rise in the price of Bitcoin in late 2013 was punctured when the biggest exchange at the time, Mt. Gox, was discovered not to have the Bitcoins it claimed to have. That led to a three-year lull in the price.But current investors see that after all the previous popped bubbles \u2014 and there have been several \u2014 the price eventually returned to its old high and then vaulted past it. The price of a Bitcoin is now more than seven times the high it reached in 2013.Bitcoin has been able to flow around the world and reach investors in countries large and small, because of the singular design that was laid out by its creator.Bitcoins are stored and traded on a decentralized network of computers that is not under the control of any government or company. That has been attractive to people in countries, like China and Zimbabwe, where the government has a history of seizing bank accounts and assets.The growing number of people using it in all these countries, often against the wishes of their governments, has also underscored the degree to which the software that manages Bitcoin has remained impervious to hackers and government control for nearly a decade.The recent price increases, though, have meant that Bitcoin is not living up to its promise as a currency routinely used for small purchases. Few people want to spend their Bitcoins if they believe the price will double in the next month.Bitcoin has remained popular as a way to pay for illegal drugs online because of the ability to open a Bitcoin wallet without providing any personal information.But Bitcoin has faced competition on this front from virtual currencies that provide more privacy. And the overall black market trade has diminished this year after the authorities took down some of the largest black market websites in the summer.This has been welcome news for many Bitcoin backers who want to see it lose its shadowy associations.Many Bitcoin investors have also come to believe that the Bitcoin network is not particularly well suited to handle lots of little transactions.These investors frequently argue that what Bitcoin is designed to do well is store money securely and outside the control of any company or government that could seize it, like a more transportable version of gold.\u201cThe reason people own Bitcoin is because it\u2019s a great store of value, possibly the greatest that has ever existed,\u201d said Jimmy Song, a programmer who works on the Bitcoin software.The last few years have brought a proliferation of virtual currencies that aim to compete with Bitcoin, sometimes with the goal of handling transactions more cheaply and quickly.This year, it appeared that the most popular virtual currency network other than Bitcoin, Ethereum, might pass Bitcoin in value. At the time, Bitcoin was hobbled by an internal battle over how to update the software and expand the network.In October, though, one side gave up the fight, and since then the price of Bitcoin has shot up, sometimes rising more in a week than it rose in its first seven years.In recent weeks, Bitcoin isn\u2019t the only virtual currency that has been moving up. Ether, which lives on the Ethereum network, and Bitcoin Cash, another Bitcoin competitor, have also been rising quickly in value as investors look for anything that might have the same durability and upward mobility as the original.Advertisement"}

This year, not only is the index up 15 percent, but it also seems to have stopped going down at all: October was the 12th straight month that the S.&P. has logged a positive return, the first time that has happened since 1935.Yet in most conversations about the ever-rising stock market, brokers and investment advisers say, are dominated by the question of when it will all come to an end.With the exception of President Trump, of course. On Saturday, in an interview on Air Force One, he once again took credit for the market\u2019s most recent record close on Friday.Generally, this far into a bull market, euphoria kicks in. In 1929, shoeshine boys were doling out stock tips. In 1999, people were quitting their jobs to trade technology stocks from their living rooms.\u201cThe VIX is too low, valuations are too high, the recovery is too old and the Fed is tightening,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, a veteran market strategist for the Leuthold Group in Minnesota. \u201cFor an old market dude like me, that is a scary list.\u201dFor several years now, Mr. Paulsen has been pleading with his clients to embrace the bull market. He has touted the breadth of the surge, in which no single sector has dramatically outrun another on the way up. And he has argued that worldwide growth with little inflation represents an unusual buying opportunity.When he meets with clients or presents his views at conferences, though, the vast majority of the questions he receives are about what will ultimately bring the market crashing down.\u201cNo one ever asks me when the S.&P. is going to blow past 3,000,\u201d he said of the benchmark stock index which ended trading on Friday at 2,587.84.In fact, many analysts say that this so-called wall of worry is a positive sign. Investors may be piling into stocks and bonds, the thinking goes, but they are doing it with a measure of hesitation, which prevents some of the excesses that preceded previous market corrections.That is not to say the market is without froth.Since early 2009, the market capitalizations of Amazon and Apple, have soared from $26 billion and $74 billion to $532 billion and $872 billion.The surge in the price of Bitcoin strikes many observers, including the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, as a classic portent of a bubble ready to pop.These are not exactly the hallmarks of a restrained market.To a large extent, the main drivers of the bull market have been sophisticated investors. Cash holdings by institutions and high-net-worth investors are at record low levels, which means they have been plowing money into the markets, according to numerous surveys.Many retail investors, though, have remained on the sidelines \u2014 a sharp contrast to the activity that preceded the bursting of previous bubbles.According to Charles Schwab, which oversees $3.1 trillion in retail investments, the cash portion of client accounts was 11.1 percent as of September. That is down from 13 percent at the end of last year, but it is still a sizable ratio, which suggests that investors are not dumping their entire savings into the stock market, at least for now.Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist for Schwab, said that until just recently, investors have been highly skeptical that the market\u2019s bull run was justified. However, in the last month or so, she has noticed a change in sentiment at client meetings and investor events.\u201cSome investors are conceding it\u2019s a bull market,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are looking for approval to jump on the bandwagon.\u201dStill, she points out, retail investors have nowhere near the commitment to stocks that characterized past stock market booms.Richard Bernstein, a former equity strategist at Merrill Lynch who now runs his own investment firm, has been bullish on stocks since 2009. He said that by this point of a strong equity run, buying stocks traditionally becomes widely accepted by all investor classes \u2014 the consequence of one outstanding stock market year following another. Nobody wants to hear their neighbors boasting about their sizzling portfolios without having their own good news to share.That is not the case this time. According to Mr. Bernstein, Wall Street experts on average advise investors to put 55 percent of their portfolios into stocks, as opposed to other assets such as bonds. That is considerably more conservative than the traditional recommendation that investors have up to 65 percent in stocks.And many pension funds, instead of investing in the stock market, are putting money into private-equity investments, even though they incur hefty fees and their money generally gets locked up for 10 years.\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cSo when people say there is euphoria in the market and people are getting carried away, I say, \u2018who are we talking about?\u2019\u201dLate last month, at an investor panel sponsored by the fund company Eaton Vance, Mr. Bernstein cited the rising South Korean stock market in arguing that fears of nuclear war were overblown and should not be used as an excuse for investors to avoid putting their money into stocks.As usual, the pushback was quick in coming.What happens if war breaks out in the Korean Peninsula, a member of the audience asked him. Wasn\u2019t he ignoring that possibility?Mr. Bernstein argued that investors should care the economic and corporate fundamentals \u2014 not the remote chance that a calamity will strike.\u201cYou cannot invest successfully,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you are crouched under your desk in a fetal position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everybody Hates the Trump Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLooking at the reactions to Republican tax plans, I found myself remembering what people used to say about former Senator Phil Gramm, whose presidential ambitions never went anywhere but who did help cause the 2008 financial crisis: \u201cEven his friends don\u2019t like him.\u201dThe answer is that C.E.O.s, living in the real world of business, not the imaginary world of right-wing ideologues, know that tax rates aren\u2019t that important a factor in investment decisions. So they realize that even a huge tax cut wouldn\u2019t lead to much more spending.And with that realization, the rationale for this tax plan, such as it is, falls apart, leaving nothing but a scheme to make the rich \u2014 especially those who rake in investment income rather than working for a living \u2014 richer at everyone else\u2019s expense.For what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s the story the Trump administration and its allies are telling. Their claim is that cutting taxes on corporate profits would lead to an explosion in private investment and faster economic growth. Furthermore, the fruits of this growth would trickle down to American workers in the form of higher wages \u2014 and rising incomes would raise tax receipts, so the tax cuts would end up paying for themselves.Even if some part of this story were true, there would be side consequences they\u2019re carefully not discussing. After all, if we\u2019re talking about a big increase in capital expenditure, where does the money for that expenditure come from? Nothing in the bill would make Americans consume less and save more. So the money would have to come from abroad \u2014 from selling stocks, bonds and other assets to foreigners, on a massive scale.Oh, and this doesn\u2019t even take account of the health care sabotage that\u2019s an integral part of the Senate plan. By repealing the mandate \u2014 the requirement that people purchase insurance \u2014 the plan would, as I said, cause 13 million to lose coverage; that loss of coverage, and the associated government subsidies, is why mandate repeal saves money that can be given to corporations.But the move would also drive up premiums for those who keep their insurance, because the dropouts would tend to be those with lower health costs. So that\u2019s an additional, hidden indirect tax on the middle class.So we\u2019re talking about government of the people, not by the people, but by wealthy donors, for wealthy donors. Everyone else hates this plan \u2014 and they should.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Women Attain an Enviable Status: 401(k) Millionaire", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyAccumulating $1 million in retirement savings is symbolic, even if it means different things to different people.For a small but growing number of working women, however, it has become a reality.Over the last 12 years, the share of women who have amassed sums of $1 million or more in their retirement plans has doubled, according to research conducted by the investment firm Fidelity, based on the 15 million participants in the 401(k) accounts it oversees. About 20 percent of its 401(k) millionaires were women as of the end of September, the firm found, up from just under 10 percent in the same period in 2005.\u201cPart of it is that we\u2019ve seen more women actively participating in 401(k) plans and contributing more,\u201d said Jeanne Thompson, a senior vice president at Fidelity Investments, who conducted the study. The firm said 133,000 people on its platform have achieved 401(k) millionaire status.Financial professionals who work with women say they are not surprised that more women have crossed this threshold, particularly as more women understand the challenges they face. Women earn less than men but live longer and often spend more years out of the work force caring for young children or elderly parents.\u201cIn the intervening two and a half decades, we\u2019ve seen the dramatic rise of female co- and primary breadwinners and, concurrently, the adoption of the \u2018this is information I need to know to protect my family\u2019 mind-set amongst women,\u201d she added.So what can we learn from these women who have achieved millionaire status, particularly those who managed to get there on not-so-stratospheric salaries of, say, less than $150,000?Contrary to stereotypes that women are more risk-averse, women who achieved millionaire status \u2014 and who earned less than $150,000 \u2014 are investing in stocks in a similar fashion to men: They held about 77 percent of their savings in stocks, on average, versus 76 percent held by their male counterparts. So they have clearly been helped by the growth in the stock market.Both men and women also tend to cross the 401(k) millionaire threshold after they hit 50, though women take a slight lead: The average age is 58.5 for women, 59.3 for men. Women may have an advantage because of their behavior. \u201cThe biggest difference is that women are saving more,\u201d Ms. Thompson said.Indeed, women who earn less than $150,000 and have attained 401(k) millionaire status are saving 18.1 percent of their salaries, on average. That amount is complemented by a 6.8 percent employer contribution, for a total of 24.9 percent, or roughly twice as much as women over all. Men, meanwhile, save 22.8 percent total, including the employer match.The analysis did not track whether these women were always superstar savers, squirreling away disproportionately more than average, or how their behavior may have changed over time. Workers do tend to save more, however, as they get closer to retirement (Millennial savers at Fidelity, who are in their 20s and 30s, for instance, save an average of 10.2 percent; Gen Xers (late 30s to early 50s) save an average of 11.7 percent).Given the women millionaires\u2019 ability to accumulate such large sums, we can reasonably assume that a fair bit of good fortune played a role.These women have been gainfully employed over long stretches of time \u2014 in fact, that\u2019s why Fidelity was able to study their behavior. It\u2019s probably also safe to assume if they had a Fidelity 401(k), they also had decent health insurance. Because they have been employed and saving, they have seemingly been able to weather financial challenges, whether it was a plunging home value in the depths of the housing crisis or, perhaps, an expensive divorce.We do not know how many of these millionaire women were also mothers, but it also seems reasonable to infer that they probably had enough household income to cover child care \u2014 or family help \u2014 so they could continue working for 31 years, on average \u2014 with little interruption.\u201cOur research further shows that \u2018the biggest investing mistake women make\u2019 is not overtrading or chasing last year\u2019s winners or falling in love with a stock,\u201d Ms. Krawcheck said. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting started soon enough and not making it a habit.\u201dTo achieve millionaire status on a relatively modest income, consider the following 25-year-old worker with a starting salary of $40,000, which grows by 1.5 percent a year. To accumulate $1 million, she would need to save 23 percent of her paycheck \u2014 including any employer match \u2014 until she retires at age 65 (with an ending salary of nearly $74,000), according to Fidelity\u2019s calculations. That assumes her portfolio grows 3 percent annually, not including inflation.She could reach that milestone by saving a total of 16 percent annually if her portfolio earned 4.5 percent, also excluding inflation.\u201cIt\u2019s more about the continuity of the savings rate and investing for growth over the long term,\u201d Ms. Thompson said.Accumulating large sums is obviously far easier with a higher income \u2014 the average 401(k) millionaire women earn $287,700, while men generate $354,600 annually.But if you\u2019re looking for a broad rule of thumb, which can serve as an (overly general) guidepost, consider this: For people earning $50,000 to $300,000, Fidelity suggests they end up with 10 times their last annual income and investing at least half their savings in stocks over the long haul. In other words, those who end their careers earning $100,000 are estimated to need $1 million.The firm estimates that will put retirees on track to replace 45 percent of their income, with Social Security providing the rest, assuming Congress strengthens the program and does not make cuts that diminish it.Despite the progress by women, men still make up the vast majority of workers with the largest account balances \u2014 and it is hard to know when women will reach parity.\u201cMany women don\u2019t have continuous career paths, they are more likely to take time off from the work force, step out for a year or two, and/or may work part time at different points in their careers,\u201d Ms. Thompson said. \u201cThese moves can all impact their long-term savings.\u201dTwitter: @tarasbernardAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Simple Fix for Our Massive Inequality Problem", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEveryone knows that we are again living in a Gilded Age.More controversial is the question of what should be done about it. We seem stuck in the same policy equilibrium we have been in for decades, with conservatives denying that there is a problem and pushing policies that would make it even worse, liberals emphasizing the need for education and skills development, and leftists pushing for a unionized labor market and social-democratic welfare state.Some of these ideas are good ones, which would make life better for vulnerable people. But they\u2019d do little to directly target inequality in our society or to capture all the benefits that economic fairness brings.The solution is simpler than it seems. There\u2019s a tried and tested way, within the system we have now, of giving everyone a share in the investment returns now hoarded by the wealthy. It\u2019s called a social wealth fund, a pool of investment assets in some ways like the giant index or mutual funds already popular with retirement savings accounts or pension funds, but one owned collectively by society as a whole. One that paid dividends not to the few, or even just to the shrinking middle class lucky enough to have their savings invested, but to everyone.Here\u2019s how it could work. The federal government would create and run a new investment fund, and issue every adult citizen one share of ownership. The fund would gradually come to own a substantial and diverse portfolio of stocks, bonds and real estate. The investment return that the fund generates would be paid out to each citizen in the form of a universal basic dividend, and the shares would be nontransferable to preserve the institution\u2019s egalitarian purpose.The key challenge in building a social wealth fund is not how to run it once it has been created, but how to bring assets into the fund in the first place. Alaska and Norway were able to dedicate the proceeds from natural resource exploitation to that purpose, but most governments seeking to duplicate their efforts would need to look elsewhere for the money.Wouldn\u2019t the enormous wealth that our increasingly productive society is generating, which now flows into just a few pockets, be a fair source? Some of the concrete ways this could happen are through the transfer of existing federal assets like land, buildings and portions of the wireless spectrum into the new fund. Other measures could include increases in taxes on capital that affect mostly the wealthy such as estate, dividend and financial transaction taxes and the creation of a new type of corporate tax that requires companies to directly issue new shares to the social wealth fund on an annual basis and during certain corporate moves such as initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions.Creating a social wealth fund in which we all own an equal part is certainly not the only way to tackle wealth inequality directly, but it is one of the few ways that we know works well and is able to work within the system we now have. If policymakers want to get serious about trimming wealth concentration, and not just use these shocking statistics to promote the same old half-measures, then this would be a fair, effective and practical way to start.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Offers Bond Swap in a Charge Toward Financial Freedom", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreece, long the problem child of the eurozone, took a major step on Wednesday toward securing financial independence as it prepares to wean itself off the international bailouts that have kept it afloat for the last eight years.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras yearns for the day he is able to regularly sell Greek bonds to foreign investors, thus cutting the country\u2019s ties to financial lifelines. That would also have the effect of helping persuade the European Central Bank to buy Greek bonds as part of its huge regional stimulus program \u2014 something the bank has refused to do for years \u2014 and further improve Greece\u2019s finances.\u201cThe return to capital markets is part of the belated success story narrative that the Greek government together with the European Central Bank and the European Commission are trying to create,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economics consultant based in Athens and a former member of the European Commission\u2019s task force on Greece.The initial bonds were issued after a 2012 restructuring of Greek debt that forced private investors to take significant losses. The new bonds will most likely be more liquid \u2014 and easier to buy and sell \u2014 creating more incentive for big Wall Street investors like Pimco and Franklin Templeton to buy them.The swap will only work, however, if the existing bondholders agree to sell. The Greek government set a deadline of Nov. 28 for offers.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Still, the offer has already had an effect. As news of the swap seeped into financial markets, Greece\u2019s bond yields have come down sharply, to around 5 percent \u2014 a long way from the 22-plus percent rates that investors required the government to pay out because of the risk of buying its bonds at the height of the crisis. As a result, the country may be able to borrow at relatively low interest rates in the future.At present, a calmer climate has returned to Greece after years of financial drama, attracting the attention of investors. American companies and financial firms in particular have intensified their searching for deals as the Greek economy has shown signs of stabilizing.Yet despite interest by international investors in the possibility of reaping rich rewards from investing in Greek debt, the country\u2019s economy continues to struggle, Mr. Bastian said, adding that the success story narrative is \u201coverstated.\u201dLast week, the Greek finance ministry lowered its economic growth projection for this year from 1.8 percent to 1.6 percent. Unemployment has declined \u2014 from 27 percent at the height of the crisis to 21 percent today \u2014 but it is still the worst in the 19-nation eurozone.Banks are still loath to lend, and nonperforming loans on banks\u2019 balance sheets continue to block a recovery, Mr. Bastian said. That has had an outsize impact on small- and medium-sized businesses, which are the motor of the Greek economy.And for average Greeks still struggling to recover from years of hardship, this latest maneuver to please Greece\u2019s foreign creditors held little meaning.Mania Kouvari, 46, a teacher at a Greek state school, saw the bond issue as an attempt to distract public opinion from the fact that Greeks remain largely under foreign supervision \u2014 recent tranches of bailout funds have required, as a condition, painful austerity to be passed by Parliament \u2014 and indebted to international powers.\u201cThey are trying to show a positive image so that people invest in Greece and everything looks normal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut under the surface things aren\u2019t normal. People are struggling.\u201dMs. Kouvari said her own salary had been cut three times over the past seven years and that one of her two children was unemployed. \u201cIs that a success story?\u201d she said.Stelios Arvanitis, 68, a retiree, said his grandchildren were \u201cworking for peanuts.\u201d\u201cThey have no real future here,\u201d he said \u201cAnd then the government tells us about bonds. It has no bearing on our lives. And we\u2019re still going to be in debt for years to come.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis and Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Vietnam: The Chemical War", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67Just before dawn on Nov. 18, 1967, the men of the Army\u2019s 266th Chemical Platoon awoke to reveille and assembled in formation. The platoon was attached to the First Infantry Division, and the men were stationed at the division\u2019s base, deep in the red-clay hills north of Saigon.The men had a typically busy day ahead of them. Their tasks included obtaining 15 drums of Agent Orange to defoliate the base perimeter, firing mortars at an area just outside the base for an evening chemical drop, working at the bomb yard to prepare 24 drums of CS tear gas, making 48 white phosphorus fuses to detonate the drums, loading the drums onto a CH-47 cargo helicopter, and finally, that afternoon, dropping 24 drums of the gas from the helicopter\u2019s rear hatch onto a target site. It was, by 1967, just another day in the life of the 266th Chemical Platoon, and in the American war in Vietnam \u2014 a war that was, in many respects, a chemical war.It didn\u2019t start that way. But as the conflict deepened, it became obvious that chemical weapons could play a critical role. In the case of the First Division, that realization came as the Viet Cong dug in north of Saigon with a network of underground bunkers and tunnels that were forbidding, dangerous spaces where conventional weapons would have limited effect. That fall, the 266th and other chemical platoons began training to use CS and other chemicals to support combat operations.CS wasn\u2019t the only tool in the platoon\u2019s arsenal, and going after tunnels wasn\u2019t its only mission. It handled anything related to chemicals, from spraying for mosquitoes to burning trash. It sprayed defoliants like Agent Orange and prepared napalm. Chemicals were everywhere, and their proliferation in the American war effort raised concerns that the United States was crossing a line in Vietnam, violating the 1925 Geneva Protocol\u2019s prohibition against the first use of chemical weapons in war.Chemical weapons didn\u2019t suddenly appear in America\u2019s Vietnam arsenal. In 1918, in response to German gas attacks in World War I, the military created the Chemical Warfare Service (renamed the Chemical Corps in 1947) to develop gas and biological weapons as a response to enemy attacks. They developed defensive measures to protect soldiers from chemical, biological or radioactive weapons via decontamination agents. The armed forces also developed nonmilitary uses of nonlethal chemicals. It supplied tear gas (xylyl bromide) to police forces in the 1920s and \u201930s to disperse angry mobs. (British military scientists developed CS as a more potent replacement in the 1950s.)During World War II, the military played a pivotal role in pioneering new chemicals that were both horrifically destructive and lifesaving. After successfully testing gelled gasoline on Harvard\u2019s soccer field, the military coordinated production of napalm in incendiary grenades, flamethrowers and the bombs dropped over cities such as Tokyo and Dresden, Germany. Chemical units spread a newly discovered insecticide, DDT, across Italian towns and in soldiers\u2019 sleeping bags to control mosquitoes and ticks that carried malaria and typhus. In 1943, the military opened a chemical and biological weapons lab at Fort Detrick, Md., to centralize research.It was there that scientists in the Crops Division tested combinations of herbicides, including a precursor to Agent Orange made with a blend of the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Scientists in the 1930s had discovered that those chemicals mimicked a plant\u2019s growth hormone, but they had been unsuccessful in harnessing its growth-inducing powers. Then in 1943, a botanist notified the Army that increased dosages turned the chemical into a plant killer, and the synthetic organic herbicide was born. Scientists at Fort Detrick tested the herbicides for possible use over the tropical vegetation covering Japanese-held islands in the Pacific, but the war ended before they could ramp up production.While the Chemical Corps continued to test all chemicals for military uses in the 1950s, it did so amid a postwar economic boom during which many of the same products became commercially available. Farmers, gardeners and groundskeepers used the newly available chemicals in their domestic \u201cwars\u201d against pests.The two herbicides in Agent Orange, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, were not secrets; rather, they were two of the most popular, widely available herbicides on the market. The government declassified its research on pesticides almost immediately in 1945, opening development for commercial markets. In May 1945, a chemist at the American Chemical Paint Company near Philadelphia received a patent simply titled \u201cHerbicides,\u201d listing over a dozen preferred chemical formulas including a 50-50 mix of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D similar to Agent Orange. (He later claimed that he developed this blend to kill poison ivy, as his son was acutely allergic.) In 1948, the Department of Agriculture registered those new herbicides and insecticides as \u201ceconomic poisons\u201d and sales quickly took off. Because of this crossover identity in the 1960s, their use as offensive weapons in Vietnam drew little public reaction.Although the consequences of using herbicides like Agent Orange later became clear, they were always intended as nonlethal chemical weapons. The line was less clear with CS gas. Though it was officially intended to flush out tunnels, those caught inside were often asphyxiated, and even survivors suffered respiratory lesions.And there was no blurring of lines when it came to napalm.Men from the 266th platoon would net a dozen or more barrels of the gelled gasoline under a helicopter, which then flew several thousand feet above a target such as a bunker or camp. Once on target, the crew released the barrels. Fuses or strafing from nearby jets ignited the barrels just above the ground, releasing a giant fireball. Anything or anyone within several hundred yards was instantly incinerated while the firestorm sucked the oxygen out of tunnels and bunkers below. Chemical platoons began training in this new form of \u201ccombat support\u201d in 1967, but after the Tet offensive in 1968 they were igniting thousands of gallons in \u201cflame drops\u201d every day. They had crossed the line.This rapidly intensifying use of chemicals in combat brought widespread international criticism, first from Communist countries but increasingly from American allies and eventually officials in the United States. Criticism had been building for years: When South Vietnamese helicopters began using 2,4,5-T to kill crops in Communist-controlled areas of the Vietnamese highlands in 1963, North Vietnam\u2019s Liberation Radio accused the United States of violating the 1925 Geneva Protocol and likened the \u201cpoisonous spray\u201d to Nazi gas chambers. But American leaders and their allies abroad paid little attention to these \u201cpoison\u201d protests; military leaders countered the radio propaganda with South Vietnamese broadcasts explaining that the herbicides were harmless to humans and used commercially around the world.The international response, however, grew more serious with the CS drops. In 1966, a delegate from Hungary at the United Nations complained that the tactical use of the herbicides and CS in Vietnam was a blatant violation of the Geneva Protocol; he also noted that the United States had yet to join the protocol. With the advent of flame drops in 1968, the charges of chemical warfare continued to amplify and rattled the newly elected President Nixon. In November 1969, he pushed the Senate to ratify America\u2019s commitment to the protocol, and he renounced first use of lethal chemicals (except napalm on military targets).While Nixon tried to assure the American public that napalm was not falling on civilians and that the herbicides in Agent Orange were safe, a report had surfaced in 1968 suggesting that the herbicide 2,4,5-T was highly toxic to animal fetuses. (Later research determined the toxicity stemmed from traces of the contaminant dioxin.) While chemical platoons continued pushing thousands of drums of CS and napalm out of helicopters in Vietnam, Nixon moved quickly to stem what he feared would be a domestic and international protest over a potentially toxic herbicide. The White House announced a partial ban on 2,4,5-T on April 15, 1970, and the Defense Department followed suit, banning all Agent Orange missions in Vietnam.Thousands of drums of the herbicide piled up at ports in the United States, at air bases in Vietnam and in small quantities at the drum yards of chemical platoons at Army camps. The military transferred the stockpile of Agent Orange in Vietnam, more than 25,000 drums, to Johnston Island in the Pacific in 1972, but the fate of CS and other chemicals at the camps was less clear. When American forces evacuated their camps and firebases at the war\u2019s end, they again followed disposal manuals of the day: burning or burying unused or corrupted chemical stocks including CS, decontaminating agents, solvents and pesticides.The American military has never again used chemicals as extensively as it did in Vietnam. American military units no longer burn or bury chemical waste. But the legacy remains. Agent Orange destroyed the lives of thousands of Vietnamese and Americans. The international response to CS drops and flame drops set off heated discussions about the nature of chemical war that continues with debates over red lines, incendiaries and barrel bombs today. And caches of chemical weapons remain buried around Vietnam and on disused American sites around Southeast Asia and in the Pacific. America and Vietnam may be allies today, but few people on either side are willing to tackle the war\u2019s total chemical footprint.David Biggs, an associate professor of history and public policy at the University of California, Riverside, is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cWar in the Land: History and the Militarized Landscape in Vietnam.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Reaches Deal to Sell Stake to SoftBank", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber completed a deal on Sunday to sell a significant stake of itself to SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, paving the way for the ride-hailing company to make sweeping governance changes and to go public by 2019.Under the agreement, a consortium of investors led by SoftBank will buy at least 14 percent of Uber through a combination of new and existing stock, according to three people briefed on the process, who spoke on condition of anonymity because those details are confidential. SoftBank plans to buy about $1 billion of fresh stock at Uber\u2019s current valuation of about $68.5 billion, but the bulk of the deal will be purchasing existing Uber shares from investors.SoftBank is to buy the existing Uber shares in a process called a tender offer, which takes at least a month to complete. During that process, a price will be set for the existing Uber shares. If investors are reluctant to sell and SoftBank cannot hit its threshold of 14 percent ownership of Uber, SoftBank can walk away from the deal.\u201cWe\u2019ve entered into an agreement with a consortium led by SoftBank and Dragoneer on a potential investment,\u201d Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman, said. \u201cWe believe this agreement is a strong vote of confidence in Uber\u2019s long-term potential. Upon closing, it will help fuel our investments in technology and our continued expansion at home and abroad, while strengthening our corporate governance.\u201dSince that meeting, SoftBank, Uber and Uber\u2019s early investors have haggled over deal terms. Some of Uber\u2019s early investors, like the venture capital firm Benchmark, initially wanted to retain certain shareholder rights that they hold through their Uber stock, according to two of the people briefed on the discussions. Benchmark and others ultimately agreed to waive those rights in exchange for concessions from SoftBank over the tender offer process, the people said.Benchmark has agreed not to work with other investors to prop up the price during the tender offer. The firm will also suspend the lawsuit that it filed against Mr. Kalanick, and drop the suit upon completion of the tender offer.SoftBank plans to purchase the Uber shares along with other investors, including Dragoneer, an investment firm. SoftBank will gain two Uber board seats as part of the investment.Uber does not necessarily need new money, as it has raised more than $10 billion in debt and equity and has some $5 billion in the bank. But the SoftBank investment will let some of the company\u2019s investors sell their shares to lock in huge gains. Early employees also stand to sell for significant sums.SoftBank\u2019s investment in Uber pressures Uber\u2019s main American rival, Lyft, to raise more money to compete on driver incentive deals and lower prices.

{"Headline": "Donors Use Bitcoin for Tax Benefits and to Keep Tabs on Spending", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGivingLike many Americans, Brad Hines spent much of September watching hours of hurricane coverage on television.For Mr. Hines, a digital marketing strategist in Boston, the storms hit close to home: Several family members in Florida were affected by Hurricane Irma. As the devastation unfolded, he opened his computer and donated money to the Red Cross, but it was not in cash.He gave in Bitcoin, which the Red Cross has been accepting since late 2014. He could have donated dollars, but, he said, the more he can use the cryptocurrency for buying goods and giving to charity, the more it will be used by others.\u201cI want to pitch in and help get the currency adopted,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also fun to use.\u201dIt was his first donation with Bitcoin, the virtual currency that was created in 2008, but it will not be his last. As more charities accept digital currency, the more likely he will open his virtual wallet instead of his physical one, he said.Few people are donating to the Red Cross with Bitcoin, with the group receiving just $2,000 worth of the currency in 2017, but the numbers are rising elsewhere. Fidelity Charitable, a $16 billion donor-advised fund, has received $13.5 million in Bitcoin donations this year, up from the $4.1 million it received from November 2015, when the fund started accepting the cryptocurrency, to December 2016.Why would someone donate with Bitcoin over dollars? There are two reasons: It can be tax advantageous, and the technology the currency is built on could make it easier to see how a donation is being used, forcing charities to become more transparent.For many Bitcoin holders, the main impetus for donating their cryptocurrency is taxes. In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service classified cryptocurrencies, which includes Bitcoin and other digital dollars like Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple, as an asset, like a stock, which means that sales are subject to capital gains.With a unit of Bitcoin rising to just over $7,000 this month from about $340 in early November 2014, sellers could be subject to hefty taxes depending on when they bought and sold. If they give those coins to charity, the asset is not subject to capital gains and donors still get to deduct the asset\u2019s value from their taxes as a charitable donation.That\u2019s partly why Fidelity Charitable began accepting Bitcoin donations. Its donors were asking about it, and the fund saw an opportunity after the I.R.S. clarified the rules.\u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything until the I.R.S. determined that it was going to be treated as an asset,\u201d said Matt Nash, Fidelity Charitable\u2019s senior vice president of donor engagement. \u201cIf you look at an overall mix of a portfolio and one asset is gaining value much faster than another, then it\u2019s strategic to donate that asset to charity. You\u2019re getting better overall value for the dollar.\u201dMr. Nash said that the fund did not accept Bitcoin directly and that it did not hold any cryptocurrencies in its own portfolio. The fund uses Coinbase, a digital asset exchange company, to accept donations and convert them into dollars as soon as they come in.It\u2019s a similar process with stocks. Fidelity Charitable turns assets it receives into cash right away, but it\u2019s even more important that the fund transfers Bitcoins into dollars because of its volatility. Bitcoin fell by nearly 20 percent from Aug 28 to Sept. 11, for instance. Fidelity does not want to be caught holding something that can decline so quickly.Some technology entrepreneurs and cryptocurrency enthusiasts say that the system these currencies are built on can alter how people give and track their donations.Cryptocurrencies use a blockchain, a digital ledger that records transactions. Normally, when someone pays cash for an item in a store, the transaction is seen by only the buyer and the seller. With a blockchain, the transaction is recorded in a digital ledger in near real time that anyone can see. It is also impossible for transaction details to be changed.Because everything is tracked, donors can easily see that their payments have gone from their digital wallets into a charity\u2019s hands.It\u2019s this tracking mechanism that has many in the nonprofit sector excited. If everyone who touches a donation accepts Bitcoin, like the charity and the store providing the supplies, then donors can see how their donations are being used.\u201cHaving that tracking mechanism would certainly be something that donors would be interested in,\u201d said Steve MacLaughlin, vice president of data and analytics at Blackbaud, which develops software for nonprofits. \u201cThe nonprofit that creates the shortest distance between gift and outcome wins.\u201dIdeally, if donations can be better tracked, organizations will have to be more upfront about how they are spending their money, including how much goes toward overhead, said Andreas Antonopoulos, a Bitcoin expert and author of \u201cThe Internet of Money.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve seen numerous scandals where charitable donations end up being used for operating costs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to see where a donation is going, but this could change that.\u201dRapha\u00ebl Mazet, a founder of Alice, a London-based software company that helps charities accept donations, said that end-to-end transparency was a long way off. Most of the organizations that charities give their money to do not accept digital currencies, so tracking stops when a cryptocurrency is converted into cash.Currency volatility is also holding tracking back, Mr. Mazet said. If the value of the currency strikingly drops before it is used, that donation will be worth a lot less than initially planned. His company transfers digital donations into a proprietary coin that\u2019s essentially worth one British pound to avoid those ups and downs.\u201cThere is the potential for currencies to be sent around the world, but these issues make it difficult to work with blockchain right now,\u201d he said.Still, technology companies like Alice, and Toronto-based Grace Token, are hoping to revolutionize giving. Both operate on the Ethereum blockchain, which Mr. Mazet said was more sophisticated than the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows people to use smart contracts, which give funders greater flexibility over how their donations are spent.With Alice, which is working with the homeless shelter St. Mungo\u2019s in London, donations are released once the charity meets its goals, like finding a place for someone to stay and receiving mental health care. Those milestones are verified by the Greater London Authority.\u201cOnce those goals are validated, payment is triggered and then reported to the funders,\u201d Mr. Mazet said. \u201cSo you know that your money has gone to help a person find a flat.\u201dGrace Token, which is still building its software, will work in a similar way. It will allow donors to distribute funds at different times and only if certain goals are met. Funders will also be able to take back unused portions of donations if they feel their money is not being spent properly.\u201cTraditionally, you can\u2019t get your money back or determine how it\u2019s being used,\u201d said Michael Yeung, a founder of Grace Token. \u201cNow we can specify a time or conditions to each donation.\u201dMr. Mazet will not go as far as to call his technology disruptive, but he does say it is bringing \u201cmassive innovation\u201d to how charities track, measure and report gifts.It is likely that as more people start using digital money, the more cryptocurrency donations will be made. If these currencies keep rising, then it will continue to make sense to donate in Bitcoin purely for the tax advantage, said Mr. Nash of Fidelity Charitable.For Mr. Hines, who gave money to the Red Cross using Bitcoin, donating with the cryptocurrency is no different from donating anything else.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it lends credence to the currency.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Crisis, Angela Merkel Prefers Elections to Minority Rule", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany faced the greatest crisis of her career on Monday after negotiations to form a new government collapsed, shaking a country that is Europe\u2019s political and economic anchor.The breakdown abruptly raised the prospect of new elections in Germany. It came less than two months after the last elections seemed to assure that Ms. Merkel, an icon of Western democracy and values, would remain Germany\u2019s leader for a fourth term.The chancellor said she remained hopeful about forming a majority government. But if forced to choose, Ms. Merkel said, she would prefer to go through new elections rather than try to lead a minority government.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say never, but I am very skeptical, and believe that new elections would be the better way forward,\u201d the chancellor told the public broadcaster ARD.Calling new elections is not a straightforward procedure in Germany. Written with the unstable governments of the 1920s and 1930s and collapse of the Weimar Republic in mind, the German Constitution includes several procedural hurdles that would ensure a prolonged and difficult process.Some were quick to link Germany\u2019s disorder to a broader crisis of democracy in the West. \u201cThe unthinkable has happened,\u201d said Christiane Hoffmann, deputy head of the Berlin bureau of Der Spiegel, a German magazine. In that sense, she said, \u201cThis is Germany\u2019s Brexit moment, its Trump moment.\u201dOthers said Germany\u2019s troubles were in many ways just a sign that the country was becoming more normal, not less. Having had only four chancellors since 1982, the country has known only a string of centrist governments that governed by consensus.The crisis erupted seven weeks after the last election, which brought the right-wing Alternative for Germany, or AfD, into Parliament, and in some ways represented the return of politics to a country long deprived of debate and policy disagreements.\u201cIt\u2019s just another step in the long learning of democracy of Germany since World War II, going from a very stable proportional system to something more messy,\u201d said Henrik Enderlein, dean of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin.The bigger question, he said, was whether Ms. Merkel\u2019s pragmatic governing style had reached its limit in an era where people crave the clash of a wider spectrum of policies. \u201cHer \u00fcber-pragmatism is reaching its end,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a scenario where she returns to her previous position of power.\u201dMs. Merkel met in private on Monday with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who as head of state is charged with trying to break the deadlock in coalition talks. He could appoint a chancellor to lead a minority government or, failing that, set in motion the process for new elections.The potential for instability in Germany would be a major blow to the European Union. Ms. Merkel has been the region\u2019s dominant political figure of the past decade, credited with guiding the bloc through the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and, more recently, providing a powerful counterpoint to populists across the Continent and beyond.Financial markets reacted calmly to the turmoil in Berlin, calculating that the German economy could power through the uncertainty. After opening lower, the DAX index of major stocks closed the day higher. The euro fell slightly.But some economists warned that the longer-term effects could be more severe. A weak government might be unable to agree on needed improvements to infrastructure and the education system, for example.\u201cThe economic situation is very good,\u201d Christoph M. Schmidt, chairman of the German Council of Economic Experts, said in a statement. \u201cBut over the mid and long term there are big challenges, especially the demographic shift, digitalization, sensible development of the European Union, and climate change.\u201dEven so, political analysts had expected Ms. Merkel to form a new coalition government that would have allowed her to remain as chancellor. That may still happen, but it will be harder now, and it is unlikely to happen soon, experts say.Elsewhere in Europe, the possibility of a weakened Ms. Merkel and of an inward-looking Germany alarmed some leaders. The chancellor canceled a meeting in Berlin with Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands. In Paris, President Emmanuel Macron of France said that Ms. Merkel\u2019s difficulties were a serious hurdle to the partnership between their two countries.France has \u201cno interest in a worsening of the situation\u201d in Germany, Mr. Macron said in a statement on Monday. \u201cOur wish is that our main partner, for the sake of Germany and Europe, remains strong and stable, so that we can move forward together,\u201d he added.Mr. Macron will be aware that his agenda for the bloc, which includes a common defense force, a strengthened euro, and a joint finance minister, stands no chance without German backing.Ms. Merkel had originally set Friday as the deadline for reaching an agreement with the Free Democrats, the Greens, and the Christian Social Union, which forms a conservative bloc with the chancellor\u2019s Christian Democrats. From the outset, all of those parties had differed markedly on key issues, notably migration and climate policies, resulting in strained talks that led to open sniping.Ms. Merkel could try to approach the Social Democrats about forming another grand coalition. But the center-left party has served as the junior coalition partner to the Christian Democrats since 2013 and on Monday, the party\u2019s leader, Martin Schulz, said his group had no interest in another round.As for new elections, the president can set the process in motion by proposing Ms. Merkel as chancellor, which would be put to a vote in Parliament.If Ms. Merkel were to win a majority in the first round of voting, the president could then name her as chancellor. If not, lawmakers would vote again, within 14 days.If Ms. Merkel failed to win a majority in a second vote, then lawmakers would vote a third time and the candidate with the most votes would win. At that point, the president could name that person chancellor or simply dissolve the Parliament and order new elections, which would take place within 60 days.But there is no guarantee that elections would improve the situation: Recent opinion polls predict that a new vote would bring little change, compared to the result in September. A Forsa poll released last week showed Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives at 32 percent, the Social Democrats on 20 percent, the Free Democrats at 12 percent, the Greens 10 percent and the AfD 12 percent.Some worry that the AfD could benefit from the current chaos and increase its share of the vote. But even if it did, that share remains far below that of populist movements in other countries.\u201cGermany is not leaving the E.U. and it did not elect Donald Trump,\u201d said Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff. \u201cIt was unable to form a government on its first attempt. That\u2019s bad. It causes instability. But it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the right-wing party that won seats in the September parliamentary elections. It is Alternative for Germany, not Alliance for Democracy.Melissa Eddy reported from Berlin, and Katrin Bennhold from London.

Faddish, highly leveraged and speculative firms can find a buyer \u2014 if bankers price them right first.Trying to gauge investor demand for such companies can be difficult. The definition of what is considered risky tends to shrink as animal spirits rise, and vice versa. For example, there were no biotech I.P.O.s for a year and a half during the financial meltdown nearly a decade ago. Investors had no interest in companies without profit or revenue. That\u2019s not the case this year, with over 30 biotech offerings so far.Bankers are well paid to find the right price. Companies don\u2019t want to mess up their public debut, so they tend to prefer the top Wall Street firms and can pay hefty fees.Funko is not the sort of firm that investors would clamor to buy when markets were weak. Its private-equity owner had extracted more than $100 million in cash from the firm since it went private in 2015, leaving its debt at over $200 million. Funko also lost money in the first six months of the year. A robust holiday season could produce a profit, but it is also questionable whether selling giant-headed dolls of pop-culture figures is a sustainable business.The fact that bankers cut the amount of shares offered and reduced the price from the indicated range, yet the stock still suffered a vertiginous drop, could simply indicate they got demand wrong. Then again, the poor performance that both Funko and Allena suffered could signal something bigger: investors\u2019 receding appetite for risk.Advertisement"}

The stocks of both Google and Facebook, which faced the most criticism in the hearings, are at record highs.During the earnings call, Mr. Zuckerberg was unequivocal in his stance on the issue of Russian meddling in the election.\u201cI\u2019ve expressed how upset I am that the Russians used our tools to sow mistrust,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said, noting that Facebook\u2019s profits will probably be affected by the amount of money the company will spend fighting abuse of its platform. Facebook said it plans to double the number of content reviewers it employs, to 20,000, and will try to add a greater degree of transparency into its advertising system.\u201cWhat they did is wrong, and we\u2019re not going to stand for it,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.The tech companies also provided new numbers on the reach of Russia\u2019s influence campaign. Facebook said an estimated 150 million users of its main site and its subsidiary, Instagram, were exposed to the posts, a larger figure than it provided even as recently as Monday.During the last of the three hearings, members of the House Intelligence Committee spoke in front of posters displaying the content, complaining that it was divisive.Representative Andr\u00e9 Carson, Democrat of Indiana, said an account called Being Patriotic, which amassed 200,000 followers, pushed out content that \u201ccynically exploits grieving officers and their loved ones in order to pit Americans concerned about our law enforcement personnel against Americans concerned about African-American lives lost during police encounters.\u201dThe account was created by the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency.\u201cMy concern is that a dictator like Vladimir Putin abused flaws in our social media platforms to inject the worst kind of identity politics into the voting decisions of at least 100 million Americans,\u201d Mr. Carson said, referring to the Russian president.Ms. Sewell cited figures showing few blacks in Facebook\u2019s work force and its leadership \u2014 a lack of diversity that she said made it hard to believe that those reviewing socially divisive ads could spot problematic posts.While the lawyers showed humility and promised to beef up security and improve technology to prevent foreign interference in elections, they admitted they could not guarantee they would prevent future intrusions. Google\u2019s general counsel, Kent Walker, said the company would work on creating new technologies to detect foreign actors and misinformation on its site. All three said they would build artificial intelligence tools to combat fake and problematic content.\u201cA lot of folks, including many in the media, have tried to reduce this entire conversation down to one premise: Foreign actors conducted a surgically executed covert operation to help elect a United States president,\u201d said Senator Richard M.

Makeup.Ms. Roark, a 27-year-old who works in retail in Abingdon, Va., estimates that she spends $300 a month on cosmetics and skin care. She watches at least three hours of tutorials each week on YouTube, learning new techniques or keeping up on emerging brands. Her morning makeup routine takes 30 minutes and involves up to 15 products.Young shoppers like Ms. Roark are the driving force behind a boom in the cosmetics industry. Always camera ready, they are buying and using almost 25 percent more cosmetics than they did just two years ago and significantly more than baby boomers, according to the research firm NPD. And millennials who identify themselves as \u201cmakeup enthusiasts,\u201d NPD found, are using six products each day.Ms. Roark, after setting aside money she had received as a birthday gift, spent $109 during a recent shopping spree at Ulta Beauty, picking up primer, foundation and a new eye shadow palette. \u201cI think every girl likes buying clothes, but for me, I prefer to spend my money on makeup,\u201d she said.The striking expansion in cosmetics is a bright spot in what is otherwise a challenging environment for retailers and packaged goods companies. Big jumps in the sale of shimmery highlights, lush liquid stain lipsticks and dewy foundations have propelled the stocks of cosmetics giants Est\u00e9e Lauder and L\u2019Oreal to record highs.Moreover, the growth in the cosmetics industry is probably understated, since most estimates fail to capture sales at online retailers like Amazon.The brand\u2019s success illustrates the way that millennials \u2014 who may spend hours on social media platforms watching video bloggers and following so-called influencers \u2014 are rewriting the rules. And brands are racing to evolve with the quickly changing market.Cosmetic companies are shifting ad dollars from traditional television and print platforms to Instagram and YouTube. Trips to exotic locations that were once reserved for editors from glossy magazines now go to influential social media personalities from all over the world who have thousands or even millions of subscribers hanging on their every post. And brands that once partnered with actresses or models to create a new shade of lipstick or blush are now collaborating with these influencers.\u201cIt was stunning,\u201d said Mary Dillon, the chief executive of Ulta, standing inside the retailer\u2019s first store in Manhattan just days before its grand opening in November.Even products that have been around for decades are being \u201cdiscovered\u201d by millennials through social media. Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Double Wear foundation, a product that was launched 30 years ago, is experiencing double-digit growth rates, said Jane Hertzmark Hudis, group president at Est\u00e9e Lauder.\u201cIt\u2019s popular among millennials because it looks great in a selfie,\u201d said Ms. Hertzmark Hudis, who also reported big jumps in sales of skin care products \u2014 particularly masks, which play well on social media and video blogs, or vlogs.Beauty vlogging isn\u2019t new, but brands have rapidly ramped up their involvement with it after seeing the power it has to influence consumers.Some of the earliest adopters of the social media influence strategy were smaller brands that lacked the ad budget or experience for a traditional campaign. Those brands instead got noticed by putting their products into the hands of a growing army of beauty vloggers.The indie brand Becca Cosmetics took it a step further in 2015 when it partnered with Ms. Hill to create a $38 highlighter called \u201cChampagne Pop.\u201d All 25,000 units of the shimmery powder sold in 20 minutes on Sephora.com. Last year, Est\u00e9e Lauder acquired Becca in a deal reportedly worth $200 million.What has also changed is the insatiable appetite of millennials for social media. The same group that might tune out a 30-second television ad will consume hours of videos and postings. In the past year, global views of beauty videos on YouTube surged 60 percent, to 219 billion, according to Pixability, a Boston-based company that tracks influencers and provides data to brands. Pixability estimated that millennials make up 60 percent of the beauty audience on Facebook.While it is easy \u2014 and cheap \u2014 for brands to fling free products at beauty vloggers in hopes of a positive review, brands are now forming closer relationship with them.Influencers are being actively pursued for sponsorships \u2014 videos or posts in which the brand pays the influencer to, presumably, endorse its product. (Under Federal Trade Commission rules, video bloggers must disclose if a post has been paid for, often using #ad or #spon and #companyname to do so.)But brands and influencers are walking a fine line as they form tighter bonds. Beauty influencers who grew their subscriber base by providing honest reviews risk losing that trust if their audience believes that they have been paid to give only glowing reviews.A flash point for some fans are influencer trips. Some cosmetic companies have flown groups of influencers to Bora Bora; Necker Island, the private enclave of Sir Richard Branson in the British Virgin Islands; and Kauai in Hawaii for lavish, all expense paid vacations. In exchange, most influencers agree to post a certain number of YouTube videos or Instagram posts about the company\u2019s products.\u201cThe trips are being villainized in a way because people feel since we\u2019re going on the trips that we won\u2019t be genuine about the products and our reviews,\u201d said Samantha Ravndahl, a 24-year-old influencer from Canada with 2.4 million Instagram followers who has gone to Bora Bora and the Cannes Film Festival with cosmetics companies. \u201cBut the reality of the situation is, with the amount of money that people are making in this industry, a trip to wherever is a drop in the bucket. It\u2019s simply not enough to buy people.\u201dFor brands, there are other risks. Unlike scripted commercials with paid actresses, the brands lose some control over the messaging and content on a video blog. And many influencers, especially mega-influencers with followers that number in the millions, typically have relationships with multiple brands, raising the prospect that an unlucky product will get lost in a mix of hashtags.Gabriel Zamora, a 24-year-old \u201cbeauty boy\u201d vlogger from Los Angeles, said he has relationships with about 20 brands. He said he mostly receives free products from the companies and has been selective about his paid endorsements. This year, Mr. Zamora teamed up with Mac Cosmetics, owned by Est\u00e9e Lauder, for his own lipstick.\u201cA lot of brands are still playing with the idea, \u2018How do we work with influencers and have them not bash our products?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Zamora. \u201cThere are brands that do get their feelings hurt when you do speak badly about a product but the fact is, not every brand is going to launch an entire line of products that are all going to be good. There is going to be a miss.\u201dA company that started on the internet, e.l.f. has eschewed celebrities, including mega-influencers, to tout its relatively inexpensive products. Instead, e.l.f. focused its efforts on locating micro-influencers, up-and-coming beauty vloggers who are still building their audiences.But executives say staying ahead of millennials is a tricky business.\u201cFive years ago, no one talked about Instagram and today, Instagram is probably the number one social media platform for our products,\u201d said Mr. Amin, who has spent 30 years in the packaged goods industry. \u201cAnd five years from now, it will be something else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Gold Rush in Salmon Country", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSITKA, Alaska \u2014 It is almost winter again here. The days shorten and the furrows of the volcano that looms over our town steadily fill with snow. At night my daughters and I watch northern lights dance green across a mountain ridge as we wait for our salmon to thaw for dinner. In the courts there is a case in which the defendant, a fisherman, claims his cloth measuring tape constricted in the cold, causing him to mismeasure his halibut. In another case a fisherman blames his freezer for shrinking a king salmon. Alaska state troopers disagree. Life continues apace.When I\u2019m not working on our tugboat, I fish with Eric Jordan, a second-generation troller whose parents, like those of so many seasoned fishermen around here, fought for Alaskan statehood so salmon could be better managed. We work the winter line, stretching between Cape Edgecumbe Light and Point Woodhouse. The salmon, chromatic shifts of light prowling the kelp forests, have slowed down by this time of year. Smoked, canned, stacked in the freezer like cordwood, their pumpkin-orange meat sustains us, as it has sustained the Tlingit community on this island for 10,000 years.The other day, during a slow stretch on the boat, Eric brought up the issue of Pebble Mine. \u201cIt makes you want to give up hope, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked.He was talking about renewed efforts to build a mine at the headwaters of one of the world\u2019s last wild salmon nurseries, at Bristol Bay in southwestern Alaska. Northern Dynasty Minerals, a Canadian company that wants to construct the mine, estimates that 100 million ounces of gold rest beneath the native spawning grounds.In 2014, after three years of study and millions of public comments of protest, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that Pebble Mine would commit \u201cirreversible\u201d damage to the wetlands, resulting in \u201ccomplete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering and fragmentation of streams, wetlands and other aquatic resources.\u201d The fishery was too valuable to risk and too difficult to mine.Alaskans had come out overwhelmingly against the measure, a rare example of consensus in a proudly opinionated state. Even the Republican senator Ted Stevens, a staunch supporter of mines, said that this was \u201cthe wrong mine in the wrong place.\u201d Investors pulled out and stock prices of Northern Dynasty fell. Slowly, bumper stickers around town denouncing the mine disappeared.Then Donald Trump, a man in love with all things gold, came along.On May 1, Scott Pruitt, the new administrator of the E.P.A., met with Tom Collier, the head of the Pebble Mine project, for breakfast. Later that same morning, Mr. Pruitt ordered the E.P.A. regulations scrapped, telling the company it could proceed with permitting. And like that, the mine was back in play.Northern Dynasty Minerals originally proposed detonating millions of pounds of explosives to open a pit the size of Seattle, which would make Pebble Mine the largest manufactured hole in the world. This time around, the company speaks of a smaller mine. But once drilling begins, permits are easily amended. What mine in the history of the world has ever left gold in the ground? The company also proposes that the mine\u2019s toxic wastewater be kept in a reservoir protected by an earthen dam \u2014 in one of North America\u2019s most active earthquake zones.On the West Coast, the Columbia River, known for its king salmon, and the Snake River in Idaho \u2014 where in the 19th century, salmon were so copious that locals had to beat them off with a stick before their horses would cross \u2014 have lost wild salmon because of dams and agricultural development. In the Puget Sound and in the San Francisco Bay, the same thing has happened.Outside the United States the picture is no less bleak. That water mill that van Gogh painted so beautifully? One of the reasons the Netherlands lost its salmon. The trendy Canal S.-Martin in Paris? It was once the Ourcq River, a tributary of the Marne River \u2014 which, like the Seine, hosted abundant salmon runs. Power plants in Denmark and fish farms in Norway have disrupted wild stocks. In Scotland, Ireland, Canada \u2014 the list continues.Alaska has remained the exception. Written into our state Constitution is a mandate to maintain a sustainable fishery, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has done well by it. We have outlawed fish farms and closely monitor escapement \u2014 the number of fish that make it back to their home streams to spawn. This conservative approach has led to bumper salmon runs in Bristol Bay, where, since 1884, the total cumulative catch in the area has been two billion fish. It took 95 years to catch the first billion, and just 38 years to catch the second. This year was record-breaking for sockeye returns.Meanwhile, fishing and tourism combine to sustain some 14,000 jobs in the area. Northern Dynasty says Pebble Mine will create 1,000. If making America great again means bringing back jobs, then Bristol Bay is already doing just fine.In Alaska, salmon give us food and work. But they also give us something harder to quantify. We welcome the fish each summer as they build their nests at headwaters. We breathe in their scent as they decay along the riverbanks. They permeate our lives. As they say on the island, the fish are in the trees.My daughters, girls built of salmon.Brendan Jones is a commercial fisherman and the author of the novel \u201cThe Alaskan Laundry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The store is a remnant of the 1970s spiritual counterculture, but also has roots that go all the way back to Helena Blavatsky, the 19th-century Russian occultist known as the Godmother of the New Age.In the 1870s Blavatsky captivated New Yorkers with her tales of sojourns to Tibet, India and Egypt, where she sought a common thread through all the world\u2019s religions. In 1875 she helped found the Theosophical Society to further this work. \u201cWhat we desire to prove,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis that underlying every popular religion was the same ancient wisdom-doctrine.\u201dThe New York branch of the Society moved to this block in 1952, and in 1977 expanded to open Quest. A framed portrait of Blavatsky hangs in the back. A hard-bound 14-volume set of her writing takes up a whole shelf, sitting alongside the work of more contemporary gurus.On a recent fall evening, Sofia Bonilla, a 27-year-old regular from a nearby yoga studio, came for a book about spiritual energy. Incense burned near the cash register, a thin column of frankincense and myrrh circling toward the ceiling. Ms. Bonilla has far-ranging religious interests. She ticked them off on her fingers: Shamanism, Wicca, Hinduism. Quest stocks books about these subjects and a dozen others.\u201cI like to learn about all of it,\u201d she said, spreading her hands. Ms. Bonilla held up a string of Buddhist beads hanging around her neck. \u201cThese help with my meditation,\u201d she said.Tarot and astrology readings are held in the back; two muffled voices emerged from behind a curtain there. \u201cI want to focus on my work and I want to get over him,\u201d a woman said. \u201cHe\u2019s like a snake,\u201d the man who was counseling her said. \u201cHe\u2019s all over the place. It doesn\u2019t matter what he thinks.\u201dTwo women working in fashion arrived at Quest after work. Shaelon Smith, a 30-year-old seamstress from Brooklyn, led her friend by the arm toward a section devoted to healing stones.A massive chunk of quartz sat on a table, next to piles of smaller pebbles. \u201cSaid by mystics to help with emotional cleansing,\u201d read a notecard next to a tray of green stones.\u201cI spend a little too much money here sometimes,\u201d Ms. Smith confessed. She comes every payday and buys crystals by the handful. \u201cI put them under my pillow,\u201d she said.Alexander Sprinkle, an 81-year-old hairdresser from Queens stopped at the shop on his way home from the salon. Mr. Sprinkle joined the Society more than 20 years ago and said the learning never ends. \u201cIt\u2019s a vast study,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps to have some camaraderie on this search.\u201dThe store\u2019s manager, Lyn Trotman, stood behind the register, ready to answer questions from shoppers. Recently, one woman complained about a particularly hostile workplace. What could she do about a mean boss? Another said malevolent spirits were haunting the walls of her home and tearing at her body during the night.\u201cWe don\u2019t laugh at anyone,\u201d Ms. Trotman said. \u201cWe listen.

But now that China has had such success, it\u2019s time to level the playing field.It\u2019s worth noting how aggressively Broadcom has pursued Qualcomm, especially since all of its previous acquisitions have been consensual. Its C.E.O., Hock Tan, had a conversation with the Qualcomm C.E.O. Steve Mollenkopf last year about a potential deal. But the two didn\u2019t really communicate again until late Sunday, when Mr. Tan called his counterpart and told him about the impending $105 billion bid.Mr. Tan didn\u2019t rule out a proxy fight over Qualcomm: He told Michael yesterday, \u201cWe really know what our options are, and we haven\u2019t really eliminated them.\u201d But he will have to move quickly, since the deadline for nominating Qualcomm directors is in December. And then there is the question of how comfortable Silver Lake, a longtime backer that is providing $5 billion in financing, will be in supporting a hostile bid. (Silver Lake declined to comment.)Who\u2019s advising whom?Broadcom: Moelis & Company, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and the law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Latham & Watkins.Qualcomm: Goldman Sachs, Evercore Partners, Centerview Partners and the law firm Paul, Weiss.More on Broadcom and Qualcomm\u201cWe don\u2019t stash money on some Caribbean island,\u201d Tim Cook told a Senate investigative subcommittee in 2013.

{"Headline": "SoftBank Is Said to Offer to Buy Uber Shares at a Steep Discount", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe price is an opening bid in what is known as a tender offer, in which a company makes a public offer to purchase stock from existing shareholders. The tender offer will take weeks to complete, and the price for Uber is likely to fluctuate until the process is complete.Yet any discount will be a comedown for Uber, which is the most highly valued private company in the world. The ride-hailing service has been making plans to go public by 2019, and investors are intensely interested in whether Uber can maintain a high valuation before it stages an initial public offering.That revelation has angered regulators and lawmakers around the world. At least three lawsuits related to the data breach have been filed against Uber. On Monday, Uber faced a joint suit filed by Illinois and Chicago over the data breach. Lawmakers have also sent letters to Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s chief executive, questioning the company about the hacking. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, has publicly said the Federal Trade Commission should investigate and fine Uber for its behavior.SoftBank is joined by Dragoneer Investment Group, which is also seeking to gain a piece of Uber at a discounted price.Under the agreement, SoftBank and Dragoneer plan to buy at least 14 percent of Uber through a combination of new and existing stock. SoftBank intends to buy about $1 billion of fresh stock at Uber\u2019s current valuation of about $68.5 billion, but the rest of the deal would be purchasing existing Uber shares from investors, most likely at a lower price. That maneuver would help prop up Uber\u2019s price.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Business Moguls Criticize Republican Tax Plans: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublicans\u2019 latest stab at tax reform would likely be a boon to business moguls. But not everyone is interested.\u201cYou would usually reserve tax reform of this nature for right in the midst of a recession,\u201d the billionaire said in an interview with CNBC\u2019s Leslie Picker. \u201cDo we need to cut taxes as much as we are? Probably not. Do we need to reform taxes, simply taxes, and keep America competitive. Absolutely.\u201dWhen you ran and won, you ran on draining the swamp, not giving new life to it.You ran on tax cuts, not on the swamp\u2019s idea of tax reform where special interests win.This is a plan that helps Wall Street, hedge funds, private equity managers, real estate and oil and gas partnerships and individuals who disguise income as profits or distributions.It\u2019s worth noting a couple of things:\u2022 Mr. Levine describes himself as a longstanding backer of Mr. Trump.During a conference call with analysts on Monday to discuss his company\u2019s $2.8 billion deal for Time Inc., Meredith C.E.O. Steve Lacy said of the Koch brothers\u2019 financing role:\u201cAnd their desire to be passive and not require a board seat and observer rights and all sorts of other things that we learned as we went through the process, without a doubt, made the offer from the Koch equity division of their company the most attractive.\u201dBut many in the media world have questioned whether the brothers actually will have no influence at Time Inc. publications. Among them are former editors at Time Inc. itself.Politico\u2019s Michael Calderone spoke to Richard Stengel, a former editor of Time, and John Huey, a former editor-in-chief of Time Inc.:One group that\u2019s not asking questions about the Meredith deal is Time Inc.\u2019s coterie of shareholders. Shares in the magazine publisher jumped 9 percent to $18.42 this morning on news of the transaction.In an apparent effort to win over his potential new colleagues, Mr. Mulvaney even brought a present.The conflict will ultimately come down to which statute applies to replacing now-departed director Richard Cordray: the Dodd-Frank law that created the C.F.P.B., or the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.Noah Feldman, a professor of constitutional and international law at Harvard University, argues at Bloomberg View that Ms. Engish\u2019s \u201csuit is a partisan maneuver that will detract from the seriousness of the effort to keep executive power in check where it matters.\u201d\u201cAs a general matter, the Constitution expects the president to be able to appoint the heads of agencies in the executive branch...The idea that Trump wouldn\u2019t be able to name his own acting director of the CFPB therefore contradicts basic principles of democratic legitimacy. It\u2019s at best a bug in a complex statutory scheme, not a feature. There is simply no good structural, logical, or constitutional reason why the dead hand of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration should continue to guide the CFPB once Cordray is gone.\u201dAnalysts had long seen Meredith, which publishes Family Circle and Better Homes and Gardens, as being most interested in People, Time Inc.\u2019s most profitable title. The more news-focused publications upon which Time Inc. was built, including its namesake magazine and Fortune, have traditionally been less of a focus for Meredith.If Meredith decides to sell those news publications, who would buy them? The smart money is on a vanity buyer \u2014 perhaps from the same universe of investors who are pursuing Rolling Stone, which we hear could be sold as soon as this week.The Koch angle Take note of this disclaimer about Koch Industries\u2019 private equity arm:KED will not have a seat on the Meredith board and will have no influence on Meredith\u2019s editorial or managerial operations. KED\u2019s noncontrolling, preferred equity investment underscores a strong belief in Meredith\u2019s strength as a business operator, its strategies, and its ability to unlock significant value from the Time Inc. acquisition.The Trump angleCritics cornerIs it Leandra English, the deputy director of the bureau and the chosen successor of the now-departed chief, Rich Cordray? Or is it Mick Mulvaney, appointed by Mr. Trump to lead the agency on an interim basis?The stakes were already high. Mr. Mulvaney is on record as having called the bureau a \u201csad, sick joke,\u201d leading many to suspect that, should he take charge, would seek to unwind Obama-era initiatives meant to protect financial consumers \u2014 and that have infuriated the banking and lending industries.\u201cIf there has been one consistent criticism of the CFPB, it\u2019s a lack of predictability, and we are now left with the greatest uncertainty since the bureau was established,\u201d said Ben Olson, a Buckley Sandler lawyer and a former CFPB official who advises financial companies.That\u2019s when the Senate Budget Committee is scheduled to vote on moving the proposal to the floor.

Mr. Johnson and Steve Daines of Montana worry that the current legislation favors big corporations over small businesses. Susan Collins of Maine has expressed worry over health care and deductions for state and local taxes.The tax flyaround\u2022 Economists at Goldman reckon that the current tax proposals could prod about 2 percent to 4 percent of top earners in New York City to move elsewhere.

A hypothetical seller would be exiting today at about 142 times the implied \u201cpost-money\u201d valuation. Spread over about six years, that implies an incredible internal rate of return \u2014 a common measure of profitability \u2014 of about 130 percent.That means a range of investors across Silicon Valley, Wall Street and beyond are in position to capture a career-defining return. They can take money off the table and stop worrying about Uber\u2019s seemingly inexhaustible capacity for scandal.Yet Uber could be turning a corner. It recently hired a promising new boss in Dara Khosrowshahi, a former Expedia chief. Sloppy governance is being cleaned up, even more so if the new offer secures enough sellers. And having SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son on its side would be valuable, with his deep pockets and ride-hailing holdings across the globe.These are heady times for tech, however. There is a risk that Uber becomes a globally significant, and yet not very lucrative, service like Snap or Twitter, both of which have market valuations of about $16 billion. There is also the tantalizing possibility that Uber turns into a self-driving, logistics colossus that could rival Facebook or Tencent in terms of value.If there was, say, a binary option of Uber\u2019s having a one-in-four shot at becoming a $500 billion company or instead a $15 billion also-ran, it would imply a blended valuation of $136 billion.

(And, for those of us unfortunate enough to lose an earring, the ability to keep wearing the one we still have.)Val\u00e9rie Messika, the founder and creative director of Messika, has been a fan of asymmetry from Day 1. Many industry experts credit her Parisian diamond jewelry brand with infusing a much-needed lightness into the convention-laden diamond stone.\u201cEven around 15 years ago when I first started out, I always felt I looked older in a full set of diamonds or matching diamond earrings,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to break the codes \u2014 to do something more cool and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\u201dMessika\u2019s latest high jewelry line, themed around 1920s Paris, includes the lobe-hugging Roaring Diamonds that combine a flamboyant ear cuff with a more pared-back twin, featuring inverted pear-shaped diamonds. The diamond cluster Mata Hari pair \u2014 again one large and the other small \u2014 evoked the flair and boldness of its namesake, the Dutch exotic dancer and courtesan who was executed in 1917 for espionage. The design nearly covers the entire ear, which is partly why Ms. Messika went with what she called one \u201cwow piece\u201d and a softer one. \u201cOtherwise it\u2019s too bling-bling.\u201dOn the fine jewelry side, the tribal-themed Thea triangle studs come in clashing sizes or a strand version that misfits long with short.

{"Headline": "Tencent of China Raises Its Stake in Struggling Snap", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLess than 24 hours after disappointing Wall Street yet again, Snap promoted a new vote of confidence from a significant backer: Tencent Holdings, the Chinese internet giant.In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Snap, the parent of the disappearing messaging app Snapchat, disclosed that Tencent had increased its stake in the company to over 12 percent. The Chinese company bought shares on the open market, the filing added.The earnings announcement has spurred analysts and investors to ponder whether Snap, whose initial public offering in March was celebrated on Wall Street, is in trouble. Though it remains a darling of younger users, many of its major functions \u2014 notably its Stories video feature \u2014 have been copied by competitors, in particular Facebook.Before its market debut, Snap had been lauded as being hipper and more innovative than Facebook and other social media companies. Since going public, however, it has had to address slower-than-expected user growth, rising costs and investor doubts about its strategy for dealing with both. Other problems that the company has grappled with include overestimating demand for its Spectacles camera-equipped sunglasses, a once-hot product whose sales cooled rapidly.During a call with analysts on Tuesday, Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, said that the company was focused on issues like simplifying the ad-purchase process on its platform and making its core app easier to use, a longstanding complaint. He also promoted the company\u2019s efforts to expand its content and augmented-reality offerings.\u201cI guess we\u2019re just not afraid to make changes in the long-term interest of the business,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said on the call. \u201cSo I would expect us to continue learning as we grow the business and making changes that we think are in the best interest of growing the user base, growing revenue and, ultimately, providing our customers with a great product experience.\u201dThat he spoke openly about his priorities marked a change for the Mr. Spiegel, who is normally tight-lipped about his strategy. Such an approach has frustrated investors who have sought a better sense of where the company was headed.But now, Snap has the support of Tencent. The Chinese company has had a history of taking stakes in chat apps, such as Snap, in order to learn more about how they work and how they perform from a business perspective. It has long held a stake, for example, in South Korea\u2019s Kakao.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Snap said that Tencent and its affiliates had \u201crecently acquired\u201d 145.8 million nonvoting shares through purchases in the open market.That represents nearly 17 percent of Snap\u2019s class A shares, which hold no voting power, and about 12 percent of its total shares.A Tencent spokesman said at a company conference in Chengdu, China, that it viewed the Snap stake as a strategic investment.\u201cWe saw Snap as an innovative company with a huge user base that is mostly focused on Western, developed markets,\u201d he said.Snap described Tencent as a long-term shareholder, but it did not disclose the Chinese company\u2019s total holdings. It said it had no obligation to disclose changes in Tencent\u2019s holdings of nonvoting shares because of Snap\u2019s ownership structure.So far, stock market investors do not appear heartened by Tencent\u2019s move. Shares in Snap were down nearly 15 percent on Wednesday, to $12.91 \u2014 well below the company\u2019s initial offering price of $17 a share.Raymond Zhong contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sina, an Internet Pioneer in China, Wards Off U.S. Activist", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 An American shareholder that challenged Sina, the Chinese internet pioneer, has lost its fight to shake things up.It was the first time that an American hedge fund and a New York-listed Chinese company had found themselves in this type of public spat, known as a proxy fight. The campaign was seen as a test case for similar campaigns at other Chinese companies.But Aristeia\u2019s closely watched appeal appeared to have fallen on deaf ears on Friday, when Sina announced that the investor\u2019s two nominees had not been voted onto the board.The company said that three-quarters of its shareholders voted against Brett Krause, one of Aristeia\u2019s nominees to the board, while just over half voted against Aristeia\u2019s other nominee, Thomas Manning.More than three-quarters of investors voted to keep Yichen Zhang, a board member who was seeking re-election, Sina said in a statement.Charles Chao, Sina\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said he was \u201cgrateful for shareholders\u2019 support, input and participation\u201d and \u201cpleased that shareholders recognize the transformative growth and the unique value of the company.\u201dStill, Robert H. Lynch Jr., a partner at Aristeia, said \u201cshareholders have sent a strong message to the company that change is needed and that the status quo is unsustainable and unacceptable.\u201dThe proxy fight came to an end on Friday afternoon, after a group of about 20 shareholders and company executives gathered in a conference room on the 42nd floor of a high-rise in Hong Kong.During the 25-minute meeting, a representative for Aristeia was given the opportunity to make a statement, according to two people who were present but who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Sina \u2014 which controls Weibo, one of China\u2019s biggest social media platforms \u2014 seemed an unlikely target for an activist campaign. It has seen its share price soar over the past year as investors piled into technology stocks hoping to get a piece of China\u2019s internet growth.But the New York-traded internet company found itself in the cross hairs of Aristeia earlier this year when the shareholder accused Sina of \u201cfailing to hold itself to the standards expected of U.S.-listed public company boards.\u201d Aristeia pushed Sina to consider a sale or merger of Sina or Weibo.Sina\u2019s operations include online entertainment and news. But its most valuable asset is a 46 percent controlling stake in Weibo, which is listed separately. The separate listing helped to trigger the proxy fight. Even as Sina\u2019s shares jumped by nearly three-quarters this year, Weibo\u2019s shares have more than doubled. Weibo is now more than twice as valuable as Sina.The campaign was seen as a rare test of the power that American shareholders have in Chinese companies that are listed in the United States. It also touched a nerve for some investors who have complained about fewer shareholder rights in Chinese companies that are incorporated in business-friendly countries like the Cayman Islands. These investors have expressed frustration that some companies appear to be managed for the sole benefit of top executives.\u201cThe bottom line is that Sina\u2019s poor corporate governance, lack of substantive engagement with its shareholders and substantial valuation discount need to be addressed,\u201d Mr. Lynch said, adding that Aristeia would continue to \u201cpursue all avenues\u201d to \u201cfurther the goals of maximizing shareholder value and enhancing corporate governance.\u201dResponding to this criticism, Mr. Chao said on Friday, \u201cWe will continue engaging constructively with our shareholders toward our common goal of long-term value creation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This is what the sales factor apportionment system, already in use by most US states, does. Corporations earn income from sales. Therefore income should be allocated based upon the destination of those sales. MNC income should no longer be allocated based upon the location of a subsidiary that allegedly earned it. The location of sales is much more difficult to manipulate than the \u201corigin of income\u201d under the current system.\u201cThe US tax base for corporations would be calculated on the basis of a fraction of companies\u2019 worldwide income. This fraction would be the share of each company\u2019s worldwide sales that are destined for customers in the United States. The taxpayer, under SFA, is the whole unitary business, including all evasion-motivated subsidiaries over which the parent corporations exercise legal and economic control.\u201d\u201cIn effect, firms should be taxed on their access to a specific consumer market - from which they generate revenue - rather than on their cleverness at artificially allocating expenses and revenue in tax havens in which their subsidiaries \u2018incorporate.\u2019\u201d\u201cI think Aspen\u2019s work is needed more than ever. We have to have a table that people can gather around, to share perspectives and ideas and to translate those ideas into action. It really matters that we commit ourselves to evidence-based argumentation, to respecting what has been established through science, building upon past knowledge. Part of what\u2019s made this country great is a commitment to being reality based and to being factually grounded. Public policy has grown out of so much serious research.\u201dThe Royal Bank of Scotland told staff on Thursday that it was formally closing its internal bad bank, an important milestone as Chief Executive Ross McEwan works to turn around the British bank.Since the division was started in 2008, the bank, based in Edinburgh, has exited 22 countries, cut its risk-weighted assets by more than half and shrunk its assets to 752 billion, or about $1 trillion. The bank held as much as \u00a32.2 trillion in assets.Closing the Capital Resolution unit is an important moment, but the bank\u2019s turnaround is far from finished.R.B.S. has not reported an annual profit in nine years. It is not expected to report an annual profit until 2018 despite reporting a profit in the first half of this year.The bank passed a stress test by the Bank of England this year that measured the ability of lenders to weather another financial crisis, but remained among the weakest of the biggest British banks. (It was forced to bolster its capital last year after failing the regulatory test.)R.B.S. also remains 72 percent owned by the British government following a bailout during the financial crisis. The government said this month that it plans to resume sales of its holdings by 2019 and hopes to sell some \u00a315 billion of its stake by 2022.That process will be helped if R.B.S. can continue to improve its profitability and its capital position. A return to paying a dividend next year also would be a welcome sign for shareholders.From the WSJ:\u201cBelieve me, I didn\u2019t have this much fun with T.

And there were studies to prove that, even as critics say that tax cuts wouldn\u2019t have such an effect.An economist at the Office of Tax Analysis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize his job, said Treasury had not released a \u201cdynamic\u201d analysis showing that the tax plan would be paid for with economic growth because one did not exist.Instead, Treasury staffers have done smaller analyses of individual provisions.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedStarting with putting his 65,000-acre Mesa Vista Ranch in Texas up for sale, with a price tag of $250 million.Slowly but inevitably, my fading vision and limited hearing have forced me to give up things I\u2019ve loved and excelled at \u2014 golf and hunting, in particular.

It also highlights the potential financial impact of those violations.Much of Mr. Lauer\u2019s power stemmed from the bond he had forged with viewers as the longest tenured host in the program\u2019s 65 years. The first two hours of \u201cToday\u201d \u2014 Mr. Lauer\u2019s showcase \u2014 generated $508 million in revenue last year, more than the amount brought in by the other network morning shows, according to Kantar Media.And while \u201cToday\u201d trails ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in total viewers, it still leads in the coveted 25-to-54 advertising demographic.The bigger pictureAt the end of the day, any company is better off \u2014 and I do mean financially better off \u2014 without someone who uses their power for inappropriate sexual behavior that makes the workplace a threatening place for colleagues and stymies women\u2019s ability to climb the ranks.A senior financial executive phoned Michael last night to complain about how the Senate tax plan would endanger the private equity industry because it limits the deductibility of corporate debt interest payments \u2014 and applies that even to existing investments. The provision could completely upend the private equity business model, this person asserted.Dell took on about $50 billion in debt for its merger with EMC Corp. At a roughly 5 percent interest rate, that means the company has about $2 billion in annual interest payments. The House and Senate bills would remove at least half those deductions, Mr. Vallone said in an interview Wednesday. At a 20 percent tax rate, that\u2019s a $200 million hit each year.The state of playThe Senate could vote as soon as tomorrow on its tax plan. But there are plenty of unresolved matters:While the 3.7 percent drop in an index tracking Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google was the biggest in 21 months, the amount of lost money exceeded any other single day on record. At about $60 billion, the decline in their combined market value is poised to eclipse any since Facebook arrived in public markets.What\u2019s behind the drop? It could be as simple as investors believing that the huge run-up in tech stocks this year has reached its natural end, and that changes to tax policy would provide a lift to other industries.The tech and media flyaroundSpeaking at the Economic Club of New York, Randall Stephenson of AT&T said that he had been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest defenders in the corporate world when it came to public policy.
