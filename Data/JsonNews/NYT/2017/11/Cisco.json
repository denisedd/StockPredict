{"Headline": "Meg Whitman to Step Down as Hewlett Packard Enterprise C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMeg Whitman is stepping down as chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise six years after joining its corporate predecessor and leading a turnaround effort that split the Silicon Valley corporate icon in two.Ms. Whitman, 61, will retire in February, the company said on Tuesday. She will be succeeded by Antonio Neri, 50, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s president.At Hewlett-Packard, Ms. Whitman inherited an aging, troubled company and delivered mixed results. She oversaw rounds of cost-cutting and then decided to break up the company. Ms. Whitman went with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which took the business software and hardware operations of the parent company. The other half of the company, HP Inc., houses the printer and personal computer business.The job at Hewlett-Packard presented a very different challenge from her first stint in the tech world. In 1998, she joined a fledgling start-up, eBay, steering it as it rode the early growth of the internet and making Ms. Whitman a billionaire.\u201cAt HP, she was handed a tough hand in a legacy business \u2014 the opposite of eBay,\u201d said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research. \u201cShe was a complete realist about the business, and generally did a good job.\u201dMs. Whitman is one of the nation\u2019s most prominent female executives. Before joining eBay, she already had an impressive resume \u2014 a Harvard M.B.A. with management jobs at some of the nation\u2019s top companies, including Procter & Gamble, Bain & Company, Walt Disney and Hasbro.Ms. Whitman was one of the three finalists to succeed Travis Kalanick as chief executive at Uber this year after he left the company, which he co-founded, over concerns that his leadership had helped it become a toxic workplace.In a $13.5 billion transaction completed this year, for example, Hewlett Packard Enterprise combined its services business with Computer Sciences Corporation to create a separate company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, called DXC Technology.The Hewlett Packard Enterprise that has emerged, Ms. Whitman said this year, will be a streamlined company with \u201ca crystal-clear mission\u201d to help its business customers achieve the payoff from new technologies, including cloud computing, data analytics and the internet of things.The company has also sought to strengthen its remaining businesses with a handful of acquisitions, including the $1.1 billion purchase this year of Nimble Storage, a start-up and a leader in the fast-growing market for so-called flash storage.Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s share price is about where it was when it became a stand-alone company. But including share buybacks and dividend payments totaling nearly $18 billion, the total shareholder return is 89 percent, the company said.In after-hours trading on Tuesday, Hewlett Packard Enterprise shares fell nearly 7 percent.In a brief interview on Tuesday, Ms. Whitman said it had been a \u201cprivilege\u201d to lead Hewlett-Packard through the challenges of recent years. The two companies that emerged, she said, are leaner, more innovative and healthy competitors in the modern technology industry. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of that,\u201d Ms. Whitman said.Her plans, she said, are not yet set. Ms. Whitman said she would take time off and go skiing, and she is the incoming chairwoman of Teach for America. Other than that, Ms. Whitman said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dShe added: \u201cI\u2019ve been working straight for 35 years. I\u2019m going to enjoy some downtime.\u201dAdvertisement"}

My sources ranged from books so rare and technical that I couldn\u2019t get them in physical form \u2014 Navy deep sea diving manuals from the 1940s, for example \u2014 to literary classics I had never read, like Henry Roth\u2019s \u201cCall It Sleep,\u201d Nella Larsen\u2019s \u201cPassing\u201d and Luc Sante\u2019s \u201cLow Life.\u201d In the end, fiction proved most revealing of the mood and textures and collective memory of the period \u2014 even a flawed novel could teach me a lot, and cheesy detective fiction was indispensible. I tried to keep all my reading together on the shelves of an antique desk I bought years ago from a relative. I would stand in front of the growing mass of books and run my eyes over them as I waited for a synthesis to coalesce in my mind of the many worlds I was trying to internalize. Very gradually, it did. Here are a few discoveries that helped.Jennifer Egan won the Pulitzer Prize in 2011 for her novel \u201cA Visit From the Goon Squad,\u201d and is the author, most recently, of \u201cManhattan Beach.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tax Bills Would Reward Companies That Moved Money Offshore", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past few decades, some of the largest companies in the United States made a big bet: By stashing hundreds of billions of dollars of profits offshore, they could slash their taxes and bolster their profits.It would take a generation to see if the strategy would fully pay off, because the law allowed companies only to defer the taxes on overseas earnings, not to permanently avoid them. Would they ever be able to bring the profits back to the United States without incurring huge tax bills?Some 20 years after the tax-avoiding technique became widespread, it is poised to pay off in a big way. The Republican tax bills making their way through the House and Senate would allow companies to bring nearly $3 trillion in profits home, at greatly reduced tax rates.In a tax-overhaul package that would provide the greatest benefits to wealthy individuals and corporations, the so-called repatriation provision stands out. It would give companies a permanent tax break of about half a trillion dollars, rewarding the likes of Google, Apple, Pfizer and General Electric. Corporate America claims that about $3 trillion in profits were generated in places like Bermuda, Grand Cayman and Luxembourg.The tax breaks for bringing home such offshore profits \u201cconfirm the central tenet of tax planning that a tax deferred is a tax avoided,\u201d said David Miller, a tax lawyer at Proskauer Rose. \u201cFor decades, U.S. multinationals have shifted profits abroad and deferred their taxes on them. If either of the tax bills pass, they will be rewarded for doing so.\u201dTo be sure, the legislation erects some potential guardrails against future efforts to shift profits offshore. It would establish a minimum tax abroad on certain types of income \u2014 at least 10 percent for the first several years in the Senate version \u2014 thus raising the tax bills for many companies on their foreign profits. And regulators in Europe and elsewhere abroad have accelerated their efforts to crack down on such profit shifting out of their countries.President Trump and congressional Republicans argue that it\u2019s important to get companies to bring the money home because it would be used to create jobs \u2014 although that didn\u2019t happen the last time lawmakers enacted a similar tax break. Mr. Trump predicted on Tuesday that trillions of dollars would be repatriated \u2014 money, he said, that companies currently are \u201cjust not able to bring back.\u201dUnder current law, American companies pay taxes on their worldwide profits at a rate of 35 percent, the highest statutory rate in the world. But the law has a big caveat: Companies can indefinitely defer the taxes on profits earned abroad \u2014 as long as those profits stay overseas.That gives companies a powerful incentive to push as much profit as possible into subsidiaries abroad. Microsoft, Merck, Facebook and other companies attribute large chunks of their profits to entities in low- or zero-tax offshore jurisdictions and therefore enjoy effective tax rates that are nowhere near 35 percent.But companies can defer the American taxes only as long as their profits remain offshore. If they want to repatriate the cash back to the United States, they must pay taxes at the rate of 35 percent, minus whatever they already paid abroad.A large loophole was opened in 1996 when the Clinton administration\u2019s Treasury Department introduced a rule that allowed different subsidiaries of the same company to move money back and forth without incurring American taxes.That removed one of the main deterrents to companies pushing profits into overseas tax havens \u2014 and opened the floodgates. Since then, the share of American companies\u2019 foreign profits attributed to a handful of tax havens has more than doubled. Now, nearly two-thirds of all profits that American companies claim to earn overseas are generated in tax-friendly jurisdictions including Bermuda, Ireland and the Netherlands, according to data compiled by Gabriel Zucman, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.The problem for corporate America, though, is that it can\u2019t easily use that overseas money for things like paying dividends or buying their own shares, techniques that publicly traded companies use to please their investors. Doing so would trigger hefty tax bills.After intense lobbying by big companies, Congress in 2004 passed the American Jobs Creation Act, which provided a one-time tax break for companies that wanted to repatriate their offshore profits. Companies brought home $312 billion at a rate of just 5.25 percent. Although the break was intended to spur investment and hiring, a plethora of studies showed that companies responded by spending billions buying back their shares, lifting their stock prices, and didn\u2019t expand their American work forces.Pfizer, for example, brought home $37 billion at the reduced rates \u2014 and shed 10,000 workers. Hewlett-Packard repatriated more than $14 billion, while eliminating more than 14,000 jobs.After that tax break, companies resumed pushing profits offshore \u2014 at an even brisker pace. Early in the Obama administration, Cisco Systems led a lobbying effort for yet another tax holiday, which went nowhere.Now, companies have accumulated approximately $2.8 trillion in profits offshore, beyond the reach of American tax authorities and barely touched by other countries, according to the Zion Research Group, a research boutique focused on accounting and tax issues.The proposals in the Republican tax package are different from the 2004 holiday. Under the current versions, all foreign earnings sitting offshore would be considered to be automatically repatriated, and taxes at a reduced rate would be paid over several years. The rates would vary, with earnings held in cash taxed at 10 percent in the Senate version. Other earnings would be taxed at half that rate. Companies would receive credit for some foreign taxes already paid.Zion Research estimated that under the Senate proposal, companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 would pay about $570 billion less than what they would if they brought the profits home under current law.American companies would no longer owe full taxes on overseas profits. Instead, they would pay taxes at a minimum rate of at least 10 percent on some types of foreign profits \u2014 compared with a new, lower rate on domestic earnings of 20 percent.Kristin J. Forbes, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s management school who served in the George W. Bush administration, said the repeated changes to the tax treatment of overseas earning were problematic.\u201cThey do cause companies to change behavior and then game the system the way they have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBig picture: This isn\u2019t how you\u2019d like to do tax policy.\u201dJim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
