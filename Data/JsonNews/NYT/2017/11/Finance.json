{"Headline": "How Politics and Bad Decisions Starved New York\u2019s Subways", "Date": "2017-11-18", "News": "System FailureDisruptions and delays have roiled the system this year. But the crisis was long in the making, fueled by a litany of errors, a Times investigation shows.Supported byAfter a drumbeat of transit disasters this year, it became impossible to ignore the failures of the New York City subway system.But the problems plaguing the subway did not suddenly sweep over the city like a tornado or a flood. They were years in the making, and they might have been avoided if decision makers had put the interests of train riders and daily operations ahead of flashy projects and financial gimmicks.An examination by The New York Times reveals in stark terms how the needs of the aging, overburdened system have grown while city and state politicians have consistently steered money away from addressing them.Century-old tunnels and track routes are crumbling, but The Times found that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s budget for subway maintenance has barely changed, when adjusted for inflation, from what it was 25 years ago.Signal problems and car equipment failures occur twice as frequently as a decade ago, but hundreds of mechanic positions have been cut because there is not enough money to pay them \u2014 even though the average total compensation for subway managers has grown to well over $200,000 a year.Daily ridership has nearly doubled in the past two decades to 5.7 million, but New York is the only major city in the world with fewer miles of track than it had during World War II. Efforts to add new lines have been hampered by generous agreements with labor unions and private contractors that have inflated construction costs to five times the international average.None of this happened on its own. It was the result of a series of decisions by both Republican and Democratic politicians \u2014 governors from George E. Pataki to Mr. Cuomo and mayors from Rudolph W. Giuliani to Bill de Blasio. Each of them cut the subway\u2019s budget or co-opted it for their own priorities.They stripped a combined $1.5 billion from the M.T.A. by repeatedly diverting tax revenues earmarked for the subways and also by demanding large payments for financial advice, I.T. help and other services that transit leaders say the authority could have done without.They saddled the M.T.A. with debt and engineered a deal with creditors that brought in quick cash but locked the authority into paying $5 billion in interest that it otherwise never would have had to pay.In one particularly egregious example, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration forced the M.T.A. to send $5 million to bail out three state-run ski resorts that were struggling after a warm winter.At the same time, public officials who have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in political contributions from M.T.A. unions and contractors have pressured the authority into signing agreements with labor groups and construction companies that obligated the authority to pay far more than it had planned.Faced with funding shortfalls, the M.T.A. has resorted to borrowing. Nearly 17 percent of its budget now goes to pay down debt \u2014 roughly triple what it paid in 1997.\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely shocking how much of every dollar that goes to the M.T.A. is spent on expenses that have nothing to do with running the subway,\u201d said Seth W. Pinsky, the former head of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201dReporters for The Times reviewed thousands of pages of state and federal documents, including records that had not previously been made public; built databases to compare New York with other cities; and interviewed more than 300 people, including current and former subway leaders, contractors and transit experts.The examination found that the agency tasked with running the subway has been roiled by turnover and changes to its management structure. Dozens of people have cycled through high-level jobs, including many who left to work for contractors who do business with the M.T.A. Byzantine layers of bureaucracy have allowed transit leaders and politicians to avoid responsibility for problems.But the theme that runs through it all is a perennial lack of investment in tracks, trains and signals.But politicians and transit leaders have not acted on a series of chances to turn things around sooner. They ignored decades of warnings from state and city comptrollers. They failed to pass a congestion pricing plan in 2008. They chose not to give mass transit much of the proceeds from large settlements with banks after the financial crisis. They brushed aside the findings of the M.T.A. Transportation Reinvention Commission, a 2014 panel of transit leaders from around the world.And through it all, The Times found, the M.T.A. has used sloppy data collection and accounting games that hide from the public the true causes of the subway\u2019s problems.\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d said David L. Gunn, a former transit system president who helped drag the subways out of the 1970s crisis only to see the system deteriorate again. \u201cI actually lose sleep over it. I get so mad when I see what\u2019s happening.\u201dWhile many politicians have contributed to the decline of the subway over the years, the problems reached a fever pitch under Mr. Cuomo, who as governor appoints the M.T.A. chairman and effectively controls the authority. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is expected to seek a third term next year and is also seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2020, tried to stave off the emergency by committing additional funding to capital construction and getting involved in decisions about how to spend it. But several transit leaders said that the interference backfired, and that the governor would have helped more if he had introduced any legislation to boost funding for core maintenance.In a statement, Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, said the governor was dedicated to improving the M.T.A., including by ensuring a record $8.5 billion in state funding for capital needs.Ms. Lever acknowledged that the subway was in \u201cunacceptable disrepair\u201d but argued that politicians and transit leaders had done their best with limited resources and a flawed agency. She said the problems stemmed from a lack of accountability caused by the city and suburbs having seats on the M.T.A. board, and the city and Legislature having power to veto capital spending.\u201cA camel is a horse designed by committee, and the M.T.A. is a train service run by committee,\u201d Ms. Lever said.On July 17, Ch\u00e9tina Muteba tried to catch a train from Inwood, in Upper Manhattan, to her office in Midtown. Everything that happened next, every seemingly tiny event that turned her commute into a frustrating crawl beneath the city, could be traced to decisions made in Albany and City Hall years before.It was just another day in what had become a maddening summer for the city\u2019s subway riders.Ms. Muteba, a 32-year-old advertising strategist, was thinking about a meeting she was supposed to attend that Monday morning when she saw that her usual entrance to the 207th Street station on the A line was taped off.\u201cThere was just someone who was working there, on the outside, on the street,\u201d Ms. Muteba said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s a block ticket,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what a block ticket means.\u2019 And he said, \u2018You have to transfer.\u2019\u201dNo one told her that a fire, caused by debris on the A line track near 145th Street in Harlem, was slowing whole stretches of the subway.The humidity that day hovered around 70 percent, and the temperature was climbing toward 85 degrees as Ms. Muteba headed to a 1 line stop down 207th Street. Drawing closer, she saw a long line snaking up the stairs to the elevated station. It was moving only incrementally, like an assembly line feeding into a broken factory. She took her place at the end.When she reached the platform, she found that trains that usually arrived every four or five minutes now seemed to be coming 10 minutes apart. She pushed onto one and felt lucky to find a seat. It stopped at Dyckman Street, and she braced herself as an enormous number of people got on.As Ms. Muteba fought to get to work, other commuter dramas were playing out across the system.For years, officials had only partly funded signal repairs and replacements. Much of the subway\u2019s signaling equipment was decades beyond its life span. Just a few months before Ms. Muteba\u2019s ill-fated commute, the M.T.A. had cut signal funding by $500 million to support projects favored by Mr. Cuomo. Internal M.T.A. records show that on the morning of July 17, at least 124 delays were caused by signal issues on the 2, 4, E, F, G, J and M lines.Nearly a decade earlier, a budget crunch had led M.T.A. officials to relax standards for vehicle inspections and overhauls and allow maintenance jobs to go unfilled. At least 24 delays across the city that morning had roots in malfunctioning motors, faulty brakes or broken air-conditioning systems, records show.And the M.T.A. had saved more money by putting off track maintenance not deemed absolutely essential. At least 55 delays stemmed from track problems that morning \u2014 not counting the fire that was slowing Ms. Muteba\u2019s commute.By the time her 1 train left 168th Street, the car was impossibly full. She was not unfamiliar with feeling crowded, having taken the subway since 2011. But now people on the train were packed so tightly that it triggered a flight reflex. It took her until 137th Street to elbow her way out.Standing in the heat on the platform amid a horde of frustrated commuters, she instantly regretted it.Records show that ahead of the 1 trains creeping south that morning, a sick rider was causing problems at 96th Street and a passenger riding between cars was stirring trouble at 72nd.To save money years earlier, the M.T.A. had eliminated its practice of positioning people trained in medical aid at some busy stations. As one train and then another were held up at two of the busiest express stops in the city, waiting for emergency responders, it deepened the anguish for Ms. Muteba \u2014 and for untold thousands of others up the line.Three trains passed her at 137th Street before she found one that she could squeeze onto. By the time she got to her stop, her 30-minute commute had taken nearly two hours. She emerged with a meeting to reschedule and a resolution never to rely on the A train again.Ms. Muteba said she commiserated with fellow riders that morning.\u201cThere was a lot of discussion about, \u2018What are we paying for?\u2019\u201dNew York\u2019s subway system has always struggled to get the money it needs.Decades of cost-cutting and deferred maintenance led to the darkest days in the history of the 113-year-old system: the crisis in the 1970s, when the subway became a symbol of urban decay.Officials rescued the subway with a simple formula: Invest in the system, and it will improve.After more than a decade of spending, about $50 billion in today\u2019s dollars, reliability soared. Cars traveled 10 times farther before breaking down. Riders returned in droves. It was a golden era; New York and its subway seemed to be on the rise together.Then, records show, officials pulled back.It started with New York City\u2019s mayors.While the M.T.A., the sprawling organization that operates the New York subway and bus lines, two commuter railroads and several bridges, is run by the state, the subway is owned by the city. In addition to creating confusion, this dynamic sparks funding battles.Historically, the city has funded about 10 percent of the M.T.A.\u2019s total budget.Mr. Giuliani decided to change that in 1994, when he became the city\u2019s first Republican mayor in two decades. Facing a budget shortfall and eager to show he could run the city without raising taxes, he announced he would cut the city\u2019s contribution to the M.T.A.\u2019s operating and capital budgets by $400 million.Mr. Giuliani defended the reduction by calling the authority bloated and noting that it had a surplus the previous year \u2014 but he did not suggest any reforms to increase efficiency. Critics were outraged. Hundreds protested at public hearings, chanting, \u201cNo more cuts!\u201d At one hearing in Manhattan, attendees waved posters depicting a two-headed mutant with the faces of the mayor and Mr. Pataki, who was proposing his own cuts. \u201cMonster That Ate Mass Transit,\u201d the posters said.\u201cWe\u2019ve spent 10 years clawing our way back,\u201d one M.T.A. official said at the time. \u201cYou\u2019ve only begun to turn the corner. It would be easy to go backward.\u201dThe mayor made the cuts nonetheless.Despite the consternation, the reductions did not immediately cause problems. That paved the way for other city and state politicians to make more cuts.Mr. Giuliani did not return multiple messages seeking comment.His successor, Michael R. Bloomberg, used city funds to help finance bonds for a development project \u2014 the extension of the 7 line to the Hudson Yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan. But he otherwise left subway funding where it was, which effectively cut the city\u2019s contribution by not allowing it to keep up with inflation.A spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, Marc La Vorgna, said the former mayor contributed by fighting vigorously to get the state to adopt a congestion pricing plan that would have provided a huge amount of revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue any mayor in history has made a greater effort to improve the M.T.A.,\u201d he said.Mr. de Blasio has been hands off. He committed $2.5 billion in city funds for the M.T.A.\u2019s capital program, but he rebuffed requests to increase operating subsidies and has declined to provide money for the authority\u2019s plan to address the delays. During town hall meetings, he often quizzes attendees to ensure they know the city does not run the subway.A City Hall spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, said the de Blasio administration \u201chas contributed its fair share year after year.\u201d Ms. Goldstein noted that the city\u2019s police officers patrol subway stations and that its residents provide most of the M.T.A.\u2019s tax revenue. \u201cWhat the City of New York contributes daily is bigger than the budget alone can show,\u201d she said.Still, the budget shows that the city\u2019s contribution to M.T.A. operations has dropped by almost 75 percent.In today\u2019s dollars, the city gave the M.T.A. roughly $1 billion in operating funding in 1990. This year, not counting money for managing some formerly city-run buses, the city gave the system about $250 million.The mayors stuck to the cuts despite a surge in property values that the subways helped create. New York real estate values \u2014 and property tax revenues \u2014 have quintupled since the early 1990s, according to the Independent Budget Office.None of that increased property tax revenue was earmarked for the subways.If the city\u2019s cuts hindered the subway, the state\u2019s actions practically hobbled it.Lawmakers in Albany trimmed funding for subway maintenance throughout the 1990s, records show, even as the state budget grew from $45 billion to $80 billion. Then they kept funding mostly flat for years, despite the surge in ridership.Under Mr. Pataki, the state eliminated subsidies for the M.T.A., opting to make the authority rely entirely on fares, tolls and revenue from taxes and fees earmarked for transit. It also ended state funding for capital work.The move rankled the state comptroller at the time, H. Carl McCall, who warned that taxes and fees were unstable.Mr. Pataki also started a trend of redirecting revenues from taxes. In 1995, he pushed through a state income tax cut and helped pay for it by taking more than $200 million in tax revenues that had been set aside for transit. His three successors followed suit. At least $850 million has been diverted in the past two decades, records show.Richard Ravitch, the former lieutenant governor and M.T.A. chairman who came up with the idea for many of the dedicated taxes as part of his plan to save the subways in the 1980s, said it never occurred to him that the state would redirect the revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing,\u201d Mr. Ravitch said, adding that the diversions were just another in a long list of examples of politicians taking the subway for granted and neglecting to invest in its health.\u201cThis is the lifeblood of the city,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody depends on it. And yet nobody cares about it enough to think more than four years ahead. They only want to think about the next election. Nobody is thinking about the future.\u201dBudget shortfalls have led transit leaders to routinely raise fares to stay afloat. The subway now derives more than 60 percent of its funding from fares, a higher rate than almost any other transit system in North America.Perhaps nothing has hamstrung the M.T.A. more than a maneuver Mr. Pataki introduced in 2000.That year, Bear Stearns, then a Wall Street powerhouse, approached the governor with a proposal to alleviate an M.T.A. budget crunch: If the authority refinanced $12 billion of its debt, the bank said, it could get a huge influx of cash without having to pay for years.Within weeks, a Bear Stearns executive was pitching the idea to skeptical lawmakers in a marathon meeting at the State Capitol.Critics denounced the move, saying it was a \u201cdebt bomb\u201d that would hurt future generations. But the lawmakers eventually signed off, and the M.T.A. agreed to the deal in 2002.The bankers and bond underwriters \u2014 many of whom had ties to Mr. Pataki or had donated to his campaign \u2014 earned an estimated $85 million.Mr. Pataki did not return messages seeking comment.Today, bonds have become the biggest funding source for M.T.A.\u2019s construction needs. The authority has borrowed about $15 billion in the past six years \u2014 about 52 percent of overall capital funding, records show. In the 1980s, only about 30 percent of capital work was financed by debt.The current state budget director, Robert Mujica, who was appointed by Mr. Cuomo, said it was sensible for the M.T.A. to borrow more today because interest rates are much lower than in the 1980s. \u201cUsing debt is a responsible way to invest in assets that are going to last a long time,\u201d he said.Still, most other American transit systems fund their capital work more by government financing than borrowing.Like the budget cuts in the 1990s, the borrowing did not immediately wreak havoc on the subway. But more than two dozen current and former M.T.A. officials said that years of underinvestment caught up to the system by the mid-2000s. Reliability plunged, they said, and it kept plunging even when Gov. David A. Paterson and Mr. Ravitch raised tax rates to benefit the authority.\u201cThey figured that the subway was fixed, and so they stopped thinking about it,\u201d said a former budget director at the M.T.A., Gary G. Caplan. \u201cYou can only stop funding something for so long before it breaks. That\u2019s what happened.\u201dThe subway\u2019s budget has not only been squeezed. It has been milked.Fees demanded by the state for bond advice are a prime example.A bill passed by the Legislature in 1989 included a provision that lets state officials impose a fee on bonds issued by public authorities. The fee was largely intended to compensate the state for helping understaffed authorities navigate the borrowing process. It was to be a small charge, no more than 0.2 percent of the value of bond issuances.\u201cIt was not widely discussed, I can tell you that,\u201d said Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester who served in the Assembly from 1983 to 2010, including as chairman of the authorities committee. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody noticed it at all.\u201dThe charge has quietly grown into a revenue stream for the state. And a lot of the money has been sapped from one authority in particular: the M.T.A.The authority \u2014 a sophisticated operation that contracts with multiple bond experts \u2014 has had to pay $328 million in bond issuance fees over the past 15 years.In some years, it has been charged fees totaling nearly 1 percent of its bond issuances, far more than foreseen under the original law.The Times uncovered the payments by piecing together state and authority records and interviewing current and former M.T.A. officials.Mr. Mujica, the state budget director, defended the payments, saying that his staff meets \u201cperiodically\u201d with the M.T.A. and its bond counsel \u201cto work out the timing of what they\u2019re doing.\u201dHe also said the fees were routinely paid by all authorities.But records show that other agencies have had tens of millions of dollars in bond issuance fees waived, including the Dormitory Authority, which is often used as a vehicle for pork projects pushed by the governor or lawmakers. The M.T.A. has not benefited as often from waivers.Mr. Brodsky called the charges \u201cunsavory\u201d \u2014 especially because state funding cuts forced the M.T.A. to issue the bonds in the first place.\u201cThey\u2019re using the public authority system as a piggy bank,\u201d he said.After questions from a Times reporter, Mr. Mujica said the state would no longer impose bond issuance fees on the M.T.A.This was just one way that officials redirected M.T.A. money that could have gone toward fixing the subway. The remaking of the Fulton Street station in Manhattan was another.Damaged during the Sept. 11 attacks, the station was eligible for federal renovation money when Sheldon Silver took it up as a cause.Mr. Silver, who was then Assembly speaker and one of the state\u2019s most powerful politicians, envisioned not just a subway station in his district but a soaring transit hub, \u201cthe Grand Central of Downtown,\u201d complete with an enormous glass dome and mirrors to filter sunlight into underground passageways.By 2008, the cost had shot past its original $750 million budget, and M.T.A. leaders decided to scale back the project. But Mr. Silver sent a letter threatening to veto the authority\u2019s funding if he did not get what he wanted. The M.T.A. quickly fell in line.In the end, the project cost $1.4 billion \u2014 more than the total annual budget of Chicago\u2019s rapid transit system \u2014 and did nothing to improve the subway\u2019s signals or tracks.Mr. Silver, who stepped down as speaker in 2015 after being charged in a federal corruption case, declined to comment.There have also been costly overhauls at other stations. Bleecker Street in Manhattan got improvements, including a neon light display, at a cost of $135 million \u2014 more than twice the initial estimate. The remodel of the Cortlandt Street station in Manhattan, also destroyed in the 2001 attacks, is still not finished, despite $66 million in spending so far.Last year, Mr. Cuomo pushed the M.T.A. to spend nearly $1 billion on enhanced lighting, signs, countdown clocks and other upgrades at dozens of stations, many of which were not considered most in need of rehabilitation by M.T.A. leaders. The project, called the Enhanced Station Initiative, did not include funding to make all the stations comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.Mr. Cuomo also pressured the authority to spend tens of millions of dollars to study outfitting M.T.A. bridges with lights capable of choreographed display, install wireless internet and phone-charging ports on buses and paint the state logo on new subway cars.Joseph J. Lhota, whom Mr. Cuomo appointed M.T.A. chairman in June, defended the spending.\u201cService and reliability shouldn\u2019t just be while passengers are on the train. It should be while they\u2019re on the platform,\u201d he said, adding that not having phone-charging ports was unacceptable in the 21st century.But Roger Toussaint, who ran the M.T.A.\u2019s main union from 2001 to 2009, said the spending reflected a pattern of focusing on flashy projects over maintenance. \u201cThe spinal cord of the subway system is the ability to move trains \u2014 signals, power and the actual track and infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Toussaint said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been spending money on the spine. They\u2019ve been spending money on the limbs.\u201dThe state has also made the M.T.A. bail out other entities in need of help, including the state-run ski resorts. The $5 million was sent in March last year, after a warm winter in which the Belleayre Ski Center, Gore Mountain and Whiteface Mountain saw a 25 percent decrease in visitors. In 2013, the M.T.A. was made to send $5 million to an affiliate agency, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, to cover the cost of reducing tolls.M.T.A. board members, who learned of the ski-resort bailout from an article in The New York Daily News, hired a law firm to investigate the payments. The firm concluded they probably were legal, according to records shared with The Times, but several members said they were inappropriate nonetheless.\u201cIt would have been far more responsible for the state to have left that money with the M.T.A. I love skiing, but if you want to ski at a state-owned ski resort, buy a lift ticket,\u201d said James E. Vitiello, an appointee of the Dutchess County executive. Mr. Vitiello is among several board members who have complained that the governor has taken a stronger role in the authority and limited their ability to direct policy.During this period of spending, subway performance slid. The percentage of trains arriving at their destinations more than five minutes late \u2014 the M.T.A.\u2019s cutoff for whether a trip is \u201con time\u201d \u2014 has increased in 14 of the past 15 years. \u201cMean distance between failure,\u201d the measure of how frequently trains break down, has worsened almost every year since 2010.The financial crisis in 2008 intensified the problems, in part because of the M.T.A.\u2019s reliance on taxes and fees. Among other issues, revenue from a real estate transfer tax plunged by 75 percent \u2014 leaving the authority scrambling to deal with a $1 billion drop in revenue.The M.T.A. curtailed 40 types of maintenance. Among other moves, it lengthened schedules for routine work on most cars from about every 66 days to every 73, and schedules for comprehensive overhauls from every six years to every seven.Mr. Lhota said the cuts, which have never been restored, were the biggest reason for the rising delays. \u201cThe maintenance intervals were stretched, and they were stretched too far,\u201d he said.Hurricane Sandy struck a few years later. The M.T.A. drew praise for its response, but transit leaders said the storm took resources away from routine maintenance.Mr. Cuomo had steered clear of the M.T.A. during his first years in office, but in his second term he took an intense interest. He placed aides within the organization and, in an unusual move, made some report directly to him. He badgered transit leaders about the construction of the Second Avenue subway on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. And over the objections of some board members, he canceled several M.T.A. capital projects to make room for his own priorities.According to high-ranking current and former M.T.A. officials, the moves interfered with the authority\u2019s plans to address the rising delays.They also bothered the respected former M.T.A. chairman Thomas F. Prendergast, who retired in January. Mr. Prendergast said his retirement was not related to the governor, but several of his former colleagues said it was a factor.Even in the face of the financial crisis and budget shortfalls, the M.T.A. has given concession after concession to its main labor union.Members of the Transport Workers Union got a total of 19 percent in pay raises between 2009 and 2016, compared with 12 percent for the city\u2019s teachers union over the same period.The labor contracts also gave members lifetime spousal health benefits and free rides on the Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road. (They already were allowed to ride the subway for free.)According to a former union president, John Samuelsen, the organization has secured better deals over the past eight years than any other public labor group in New York.\u201cI look back with satisfaction on what, together, we have accomplished,\u201d Mr. Samuelsen said in a September letter announcing that he was becoming the union\u2019s international president.Each of three deals signed from 2009 to 2017 cost more than the M.T.A. anticipated, forcing it to take money from other parts of the budget. The 2014 deal, which cost $525 million, was funded by tapping into a pay-as-you-go account that was intended to pay for capital work, former officials said.Subway workers, including managers and administrative personnel, now make an average of about $155,000 annually in salary, overtime and benefits, according to a Times analysis of data compiled by the federal Department of Transportation. That is far more than in any other American transit system; the average in cities like Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington is less than $100,000 in total compensation annually.The pay for managers alone is even more extraordinary. The nearly 2,500 people who work in New York subway administration make, on average, $240,000 in salary, overtime and benefits. The average elsewhere is less than $115,000.New York is more expensive than most other cities, but not by that much. The latest estimate from the federal Department of Commerce said the region\u2019s cost of living was 22 percent higher than the national average and 10 percent higher than the average for other areas with subways.Mr. Samuelsen rejected the idea that subway workers were overpaid, arguing that it is a dangerous job in which assault is common. \u201cWe earn every penny that we make,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is New York City. This isn\u2019t Mayberry. It costs $700,000 to buy a house in Brooklyn. What do you want us to make? Fifteen dollars an hour?\u201dUnion rules also drive up costs, including by requiring two M.T.A. employees on every train \u2014 one to drive, and one to oversee boarding. Virtually every other subway in the world staffs trains with only one worker; if New York did that, it would save nearly $200 million a year, according to an internal M.T.A. analysis obtained by The Times.Several M.T.A. officials involved in negotiating recent contracts said that there was one reason they accepted the union\u2019s terms: Mr. Cuomo.The governor, who is closely aligned with the union and has received $165,000 in campaign contributions from the labor group, once dispatched a top aide to deliver a message, they said.Pay the union and worry about finding the money later, the aide said, according to two former M.T.A. officials who were in the room.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office said in a statement that the M.T.A. handled its own labor negotiations and that campaign contributions had not influenced any of his actions.The cost of increasing delays can be measured not only in numbers, but also in painful absences on special occasions, lost wages and blown opportunities. Over the summer, The Times asked readers to share their experiences with the subway. More than 1,000 responded, mostly with stories of sorrow.Ashley Patterson, 24, from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, began having anxiety attacks on the subway this summer and now follows a careful routine to keep calm during delays.\u201cI think that that\u2019s something that the M.T.A. should be thinking about,\u201d Ms. Patterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the inconvenience of being late to work. There\u2019s this mental health aspect.\u201dLaura Hernandez, 34, a city employee from Woodside, Queens, missed an appointment to inspect the housing conditions of the clients of a social service agency. \u201cI am a new employee on probation, and it does not look good to arrive over an hour late for an appointment,\u201d Ms. Hernandez said.Juliana S. Karol, 30, from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is a rabbinical student at Hebrew Union College downtown. She was late to a meeting to discuss her senior thesis, ordination and job placement. She was also 38 weeks pregnant.\u201cI actually ended up writing my High Holy Days sermon about the subway,\u201d Ms. Karol said. \u201cAbout the opportunities that the subway crisis gives us to reframe both the gratitude we have when things are going right and how we respond when they are not.\u201dThe entire fifth-grade class at Public School 32 in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, had to cancel a field trip to see a movie \u2014 a reward for completing math exams.\u201cThey had actually gone to the station, and they just ended up waiting forever,\u201d said Dawn Reed, 52, whose son was one of the disappointed students. She said she used the experience to teach him about managing expectations. \u201cIt\u2019s getting progressively worse,\u201d she said of the subway. \u201cAnd delays are a part of life, and it\u2019s difficult to have any sense of consistency.\u201dAriel Leigh Cohen, 26, from Sunnyside, Queens, missed an interview for a job painting scenery for a major Broadway show. It would have paid twice her salary as a salon receptionist and brought her closer to her dream of working in show business.\u201cI was trying to change my life and do what I came to New York to do,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cIt would\u2019ve opened up another world of possibilities. Opportunities like that don\u2019t come around often at all.\u201dAnd then there are stories like Rosalie Osian\u2019s. A chaplain who comforts the terminally ill for Caring Hospice Services, Ms. Osian, 58, got word one Friday that a patient was dying in Brooklyn, and she struck out on a 2 train from 72nd Street in Manhattan.She made it as far as Fulton Street downtown before an announcement told her to switch to the 4 or 5. Problems on that line forced her to switch trains again, and at one point she was left standing on a platform, racked by the need to be with the patient and prepare the family for grief and pending loss. She was late getting there but made it before the patient died.\u201cI\u2019m not the only one,\u201d Ms. Osian said. \u201cThere are people traveling the city all day helping people. There are home health aides and others. And if the subways are delayed, they can\u2019t get to their work.\u201dAlthough riders have bemoaned delays on the subway for years, they often have no idea what is causing them.This is a byproduct of 30 years of transit officials seeking to avoid blame for the system\u2019s problems, The Times found.Every day, officials collect data that could be used to improve the system. For every incident that causes a delay, workers are supposed to log the time, location, duration, cause and department responsible. In theory, the data could be studied to identify patterns in delays and shed light on how they might be fixed.That has not happened.In 1986, the M.T.A.\u2019s inspector general discovered that the delay records were \u201cseriously flawed\u201d \u2014 and shot through with biased reporting, unauthorized adjustments, illegible entries and omissions. In the 1990s, investigators twice concluded that the count was riddled with errors and misrepresentations.John Gaul, then the assistant chief of rapid transit operations, acknowledged at the time that the process was susceptible to fraud because operators were being asked to collect data on their own performances. \u201cIn many cases, undue pressure had been imposed on supervisors in the field to meet on-time performance goals,\u201d he said.Three former high-ranking subway officials told The Times that little had changed since the 1980s. Before final delay reports are issued, M.T.A. departments argue about who should be blamed. Sometimes, the reports reflect more on a department\u2019s arguing ability than on its actual performance.The officials also said that different tactics had been used over the years to avoid culpability.From September 2009 to May 2010, records show, some 530,000 delays \u2014 80 percent of all delays recorded \u2014 were lumped into a category called \u201csupplement schedule.\u201d The officials said that whenever maintenance work in the system caused a scheduling change, virtually all delays were put under this label, regardless of their cause.In recent years, the M.T.A. has stopped using the category.Today, M.T.A. documents say that the most common cause of delays is \u201covercrowding.\u201d More than 111,000 delays were put into that category in the first four months of 2017 alone. That was 37 percent of all delays.New York politicians and transit leaders have seized on the figures to suggest that most of the subway\u2019s problems come down to its popularity.But the M.T.A.\u2019s own records call that into question.In March 2015, records show, more than 153 million trips were recorded, making it one of the busiest months on record. There were 19,000 delays attributed to overcrowding.Last March, two million fewer rides were recorded, but 30,000 delays were said to be caused by overcrowding.Mr. Lhota said that quirks existed in all data and that M.T.A. officials handled the classification consistently. He rejected any suggestion that officials were manipulating numbers to make themselves look better or blame customers for problems. \u201cThe delays are solely the responsibility of the New York City Transit Authority,\u201d he said, referring to the agency that runs the subway.Still, the murkiness of what is truly causing delays only feeds frustration for riders like Ms. Muteba, the advertising strategist whose 30-minute commute became a two-hour odyssey of packed cars and angry riders after a track fire in July.Though the number of passengers on the 1 line swelled temporarily that morning because riders were avoiding the blocked A train, dozens of delays were not attributed to the track fire. They were attributed to overcrowding, records show.\u201cYou\u2019re just kind of like, \u2018It\u2019s a lost cause,\u2019\u201d Ms. Muteba said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like beating a dead horse.\u201dAn earlier version of this article overstated compensation figures for subway workers and managers, based on a Times analysis of federal data. Subway workers, including administrative personnel and managers, make an average of about $155,000 a year in salary, overtime and benefits, not $170,000 (the higher figure includes some labor-related overhead costs). The average figure for managers alone, not including overhead costs, is $240,000 a year, not $280,000 (and not \u201cnearly $300,000,\u201d as the article said in one reference).Agustin Armendariz and Vivian Wang contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Tom Cotton, Said to Be Trump\u2019s C.I.A. Pick, Would Bring Ambition but Little Experience", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The first time Donald J. Trump met Senator Tom Cotton, in summer 2015, the two commiserated over their shared hatred of the nuclear deal that President Barack Obama had just struck with Iran.Should the plan hold and he be confirmed for the post, Mr. Cotton, the youngest member of the Senate, would also be the youngest person ever to lead the nation\u2019s premier intelligence agency. Serving as C.I.A. director would seal his reputation as a young man in a hurry in Washington, underlined by his lack of experience relevant to the job.It is unclear how leaving the Senate would affect Mr. Cotton\u2019s outsize political ambition, widely believed to include an eventual run for president. But choosing Mr. Cotton as C.I.A. director would be the latest in a string of appointments by Mr. Trump that reflect his preference for loyalists who are unapologetic about couching their hawkish stances on national security issues in sharply partisan terms.On Capitol Hill, Mr. Cotton \u2014 a lanky long-distance runner who speaks with a slight Southern drawl and who has said that he eats a piece of birthday cake most days \u2014 is known for his discipline and intellect.\u201cHe is incredibly analytical, he is immersed in world affairs and he has a lot of good relationships\u201d on Capitol Hill, which would help him succeed at the C.I.A., said Jeremy Bash, the former chief of staff at the agency under Leon E. Panetta.\u201cWhat is less clear,\u201d he added, \u201cis how he would click with the White House and the rest of the intelligence community, and whether or not he would be prepared to relinquish the role of a policymaker. He would really have to be prepared to park his policy views at the Langley gates.\u201dCurrent and former intelligence officials said on Thursday that they doubted that Mr. Cotton could do so, arguing that he lacked the gravitas to run the C.I.A. and that he was temperamentally unsuited to it.\u201cSenator Cotton is a very partisan, very ideological figure who is not well cut out to head an agency whose mission is to provide the most objective possible analysis of situations overseas,\u201d said Paul R. Pillar, a 28-year intelligence community veteran who is a senior fellow at the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service.His letter to the mullahs, Mr. Pillar said, \u201cdemonstrated the extent to which Mr. Cotton is willing to go beyond the norms of the conduct of U.S. foreign and national security policy, and that is not the kind of person who would make an effective leader of the C.I.A.\u201dMr. Cotton\u2019s office said he was unavailable on Thursday for an interview and declined to respond directly to questions about whether he would be nominated for the C.I.A. position.\u201cSenator Cotton\u2019s focus is on serving Arkansans in the Senate,\u201d said Caroline Rabbitt Tabler, his spokeswoman.He attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School, and served as a clerk with the United States Court of Appeals before joining a private law practice in Washington.After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Cotton joined the Army and spent almost five years on active duty, including as a platoon leader on combat patrols in Baghdad. Even while deployed, he worked to cultivate a political network, reaching out to William Kristol, then the editor of The Weekly Standard, to compliment him on the magazine, as well as to other prominent conservatives.After a brief stint at McKinsey and Company, Mr. Cotton won election to the House in 2012, where he quickly developed a reputation for his unwillingness to compromise, and in 2014, he defeated Mark Pryor, a Democrat, for a Senate seat.While Mr. Tillerson teamed with Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense, to prevail upon Mr. Trump not to abandon the Iran nuclear accord, Mr. Cotton\u2019s elevation, taken together with that of Mr. Pompeo, would place two of the deal\u2019s most outspoken critics in crucial positions of power to enable the president to accomplish his long-stated goal of ripping it up.If Mr. Cotton does take the helm at the C.I.A., he will be faced with the steep task of finding a way to show the agency\u2019s employees \u2014 the vast bulk of whom are career officials trained to be skeptical of outsiders \u2014 that he is not a purely political creature, while pleasing a president who tends to see intelligence matters through the prism of partisan politics. Striking that balance proved a challenge for Mr. Pompeo, who elicited concern in the intelligence community that his ideological bent colored his views on contentious issues, including the Iran nuclear deal, which agency analysts believe is working.It is a familiar challenge to any politician who has moved to the C.I.A., said John E. McLaughlin, who was the deputy director and acting director of the agency from 2000 to 2004.\u201cHe\u2019s obviously smart and experienced in war, and those are good things,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin said of Mr. Cotton. \u201cHe also has very strong policy views. Like all politicians who take that job, the challenge is to shift from making policy to informing policy, leaving ideology behind and marshaling the most objective of facts even if they run counter to personal beliefs.\u201dMr. McLaughlin said the model for such a transition was the elder George Bush, who made the move from the chairman of the Republican Party to C.I.A. director. Mr. Cotton would be wise, he said, to study that example.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the deputy director and acting director of the C.I.A. from 2000 to 2004. He is John E. McLaughlin, not McLoughlin.Adam Goldman and Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Roy Moore, a Long History of Combat and Controversy", "Date": "2017-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGADSDEN, Ala. \u2014 It was 1982, and four circuit judges from rural Etowah County, Ala., had filed a state bar complaint against a lawyer named Roy S. Moore, accusing him of running \u201cslanderous\u201d political ads that had portrayed the local legal system as corrupt.The response from the 35-year-old Mr. Moore, who had just lost his own effort to win a judgeship, was infused with the kind of crusading righteousness \u2014 his critics would call it sanctimony \u2014 that would later fuel his rise to national fame.\u201cIf the judges of Etowah County are personally offended, that is their problem, not mine,\u201d he declared in a letter addressing the judges\u2019 complaint. Mr. Moore added a line from Proverbs: \u201cThe guilty flee when no man pursueth.\u201dToday, rather than flee, or at least quit his race for the Senate, as many are demanding, Mr. Moore is declaring his innocence and charging ahead despite allegations of improper sexual behavior.Mr. Moore first made a name for himself as a prosecutor and an anti-establishment political outsider here in Gadsden in the years after 1977, when he returned to Etowah County after an education at West Point, a tour of duty in Vietnam and law school in Tuscaloosa. He already had the contentiousness, if not the overt religiosity.During those years, he was developing another reputation, passed along in whispers. Now they have grown to a roar, threatening to derail what might have been a cakewalk political contest in deeply conservative Alabama.\u201cIt was a known fact: Roy Moore liked young girls,\u201d said Faye Gary, a retired Gadsden police officer. \u201cIt was treated like a joke. That\u2019s just the way it was.\u201dAfter coming home, Mr. Moore landed a job as an assistant district attorney. M. D. Garmon, a former reporter for The Gadsden Times, remembered him as eager to shake things up. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to be in the clique of judges and the attorneys apparently,\u201d Mr. Garmon said. \u201cHe was sort of standoffish to them, which in turn affected their treatment of him.\u201dMr. Moore was rarely seen in the places where lawyers would routinely gather to swap gossip, said James Sledge, a former federal judge who was a lawyer at the time. Few remember him out and about socially. He is, however, remembered as a common presence at the Y.M.C.A. and the Gadsden Mall.As with everything concerning Mr. Moore, accounts vary. Alice Bircheat, the longtime bookkeeper at the Y.M.C.A., said that she recalled \u201cnot one complaint\u201d about Mr. Moore. Terry White, 70, a former Gadsden police officer who worked security at the mall, said, \u201cNobody, as far as I know, ever complained.\u201dMyron K. Allenstein, a local lawyer who rented office space to Mr. Moore and later tried cases with him, insisted that Mr. Moore was a man of unimpeachable character. \u201cHe\u2019s real down to earth but feels real strongly about what he believes,\u201d he said. Mr. Allenstein noted that he was a Democrat who planned to vote for Mr. Moore in the Dec. 12 election.But numerous people remembered otherwise. They recalled Mr. Moore working out at the Y.M.C.A. gym, often shirtless. Delores Abney, 63, said she recalled Mr. Moore talking to women that \u201cappeared to be high school on up\u201d in an exercise class she was enrolled in. \u201cIt just did not look appropriate.\u201dJanet Reeves, 57, a former employee of a photo kiosk and an Orange Julius at the mall, talked of Mr. Moore asking a friend of hers, who she recalled was 17 or 18, for her phone number. \u201cI just thought he was the creepy old guy,\u201d she said.Glenn Day, 64, who managed two stores at the mall in those years, recalled that Mr. Moore had such reputation for approaching young women that the mall guard asked him to let security know whenever he saw Mr. Moore there. \u201cI can\u2019t believe there\u2019s such an outcry now,\u201d Mr. Day said, \u201cabout something everybody knew.\u201dIn his 2005 memoir, \u201cSo Help Me God,\u201d Mr. Moore described his battles with the local establishment, and acknowledged that it made him enemies. He criticized laws that let criminals out for \u201cgood time\u201d served, the bail bond system, and planned budget cuts to the sheriff\u2019s department. He sued the county when it declined him raises he was due. He was rocking the boat, he wrote, \u201cand none of the other passengers seemed happy.\u201dPeople who grew up with him suggest his polarizing reputation goes back further than his days as a county prosecutor.\u201cHe was very bright,\u201d said Janet Hinton, who was two years behind Mr. Moore in high school. She remembered him coming from a poor family that struggled to get by. He was also, she said, \u201cknown as a real bragger who acted like the smartest person in the classroom.\u201dTwenty years later, he was inspiring some of the same strong feelings, alienating much of the Gadsden legal community and provoking local judges to take the rare step of filing bar complaints against him. (The complaints were eventually closed without action being taken.) An unsuccessful run for county judge in 1982, though giving voters a taste of the hard-line populism that would later draw a national fan base, only seemed to leave him more isolated.Bill Willard, a longtime lawyer here, ventured a theory. He pointed out that Mr. Moore had never seemed to have any kind of social life, certainly not among his professional peers. And the current allegations, he said, could be seen in that context.\u201cHe was really immature socially,\u201d Mr. Willard said of Mr. Moore\u2019s reputed attraction to teenagers, \u201cand so it might kind of make sense.\u201dHaving resigned his prosecutor job to run for judge and spent his savings to finance his failed bid, Mr. Moore left for Texas, to train as a kickboxer.It was a break from a trajectory that started with a working-class childhood in Gallant, a small rural community in the foothills east of Gadsden, where his father was a construction worker and his mother a homemaker. His path to adulthood was marked with blue-chip resume highlights, but also struggle and unpleasantness.In high school, Mr. Moore was elected student body president but is remembered by classmates as more hard-working than sociable. He fulfilled his dream of attending the United States Military Academy at West Point \u2014 people in Gadsden remember him showing up at an assembly at his old high school and walking around proudly in his cadet uniform. But he found the academy to be an intimidating place, peopled, he later wrote, by students who were more \u201cwell read, traveled or experienced\u201d than he was and who considered him \u201can easy target.\u201dIt was at West Point, he wrote, that he found the boxing ring to be an equalizer, \u201cwhere someone from Alabama with a \u2018country\u2019 accent could get as much respect as anybody else.\u201d He graduated in the bottom quarter of his class.In Vietnam, where Mr. Moore commanded a military police battalion, he cracked down so aggressively on what he described as his troops\u2019 drug use and lack of respect for authority that they derisively referred to him as Captain America. He was so convinced, he wrote, that one soldier was going to kill him that he put sandbags under the bed, ostensibly to keep grenades from being rolled under it.One afternoon in 1984, U. W. Clemon, a federal district court judge, was having lunch in his Gadsden office when Mr. Moore stopped by. He had returned after more than a year of boxing in Texas and working on a cattle ranch in the Australian outback.Judge Clemon, the first black federal judge in Alabama history, remembered Mr. Moore from several years earlier, when, as a prosecutor, Mr. Moore had urged opposition to his confirmation to the bench, charging that Judge Clemon was soft on crime.\u201cHe said he was sorry that he had done it, it was wrong and he had heard good things about me,\u201d Judge Clemon remembered of that afternoon. Mr. Moore was not finished, though. He was opening a law office, he said, and he knew the judge had old law clients in Gadsden. He needed referrals.So began Mr. Moore\u2019s second run at a legal career here, this time as a private practice attorney, working out of a room he rented from Mr. Allenstein in an 1897 Victorian manse, converted into an office building, near the courthouse. Mr. Allenstein remembered him as \u201ca great orator\u201d who was particularly gifted at closing arguments.\u201cHe\u2019d always say, \u2018Myron you take care of the law, just get me to the jury,\u201d Mr. Allenstein said. \u201cBecause he was a great talker.\u201dKathleen Warren, a lawyer who shared the office space, has different memories.\u201cHe seemed to not think much of women as a whole,\u201d she said. \u201cA true sexist.\u201dShe had heard the gossip about him and young women, but the talk faded around the time of his marriage. At a Christmas gathering in 1984, as he describes in his book, he met a 23-year-old woman named Kayla Kisor, 14 years his junior, whom he immediately recognized from a dance recital he had attended \u201cmany years before.\u201d They married the next year.As he settled in to raise a family and practice law, Mr. Moore remained combative, but few remember him as explicitly religious, though they concede he may have been at home.\u201cI think this, the whole religious thing, just came as an evolution of his political career,\u201d said Mr. Garmon, the former Gadsden Times reporter, a Democrat who said he liked Mr. Moore but abhorred his politics.In 1992, Mr. Moore finally became a circuit court judge. He was appointed by the governor at the time, Guy Hunt, to whom he had a connection through a family friend, after the sitting judge died of a heart attack. To decorate his courtroom, Mr. Moore put up a homemade redwood plaque of the Ten Commandments \u2014 a precursor to the granite behemoth he would later install in the state judicial building. Few seemed bothered, at first.But the next year, lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union took notice and threatened to sue. And \u201cby the time the election came around,\u201d Mr. Garmon said, referring to Mr. Moore\u2019s re-election bid, \u201ceveryone in the county knew about Roy and the Ten Commandments.\u201dLarge rallies of support took place on the courthouse steps, and lawyers recall how Mr. Moore carefully gathered all his press clippings, laminated in giant scrapbooks. A fellow judge, William H. Rhea, remembered seeing envelopes around Mr. Moore\u2019s office: \u201cPeople were sending him money from all around the country. You know, like $5 and $10.\u201dGadsden watched him become a hero of the religious right with mixed feelings.\u201cI don\u2019t want to use the word disgust,\u201d said Kathleen Sisson, 67, a retired educator who had known for years about Ms. Corfman\u2019s account of Mr. Moore. \u201cBut it bothered me greatly to know what I knew.\u201dMr. Moore would go on to win legal fights and lose them, win elections and be removed from office only to win again, and eventually win the Republican nomination for United States Senate.\u201cI don\u2019t frankly understand how it all came out, and I was there for every day of it,\u201d Judge Rhea said of Mr. Moore\u2019s ascent to national prominence. \u201cIt was just something that took off. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it.\u201dAlan Blinder contributed reporting from Gadsden and Serge F. Kovaleski from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lessons of Cyrus Vance\u2019s Campaign Contributions", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe controversy swirling around the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr. for taking large campaign contributions from two defense lawyers after his office declined to prosecute their clients points to the urgent need for major reform. We need public financing of district attorney races. The good news is that New York City already has a highly regarded campaign finance system and it would be easy to include the five city district attorneys in it.The public is entitled to both the appearance and reality of honest justice in criminal cases. But given the legality of large contributions to district attorneys and the frequency of contributions from criminal defense lawyers, the appearance of influence is inescapable. Indeed, the present system may create opportunities for actual improper influence.Although Mr. Vance has steadfastly maintained that he acted in an entirely proper way in dismissing the cases and was not influenced by the contributions or the likelihood of receiving them, much of the public will not believe him. That kind of cynicism erodes confidence in prosecutors and ultimately can seriously impair the functioning of the criminal justice system.When the public doesn\u2019t trust a prosecutor, juries become skeptical of evidence and are more apt to acquit defendants who genuinely threaten public safety. More fundamentally, the criminal justice system is built on the premise of public confidence in prosecutors\u2019 impartiality. Criminal laws are often drafted quite broadly, and we rely on a prosecutor\u2019s judgment to screen out cases where conduct is technically in violation of the statute, but prosecution would be unfair. The appearance of undue influence by defense lawyers will undermine the legitimacy of this prosecutorial discretion.Currently, district attorney elections are governed by New York State\u2019s notoriously lax campaign finance laws. In Manhattan, for example, an individual may contribute up to $50,000 to a district attorney candidate \u2014 and even that generous limit has a loophole allowing additional contributions through corporations the individual donor owns or controls.By contrast, elections for New York City offices, including for mayor and City Council, are subject to much stricter limits. Contributions to mayoral candidates are limited to $4,950 for an election cycle, which includes the primary and general elections. Corporate contributions are prohibited. Crucially, the first $175 of any individual\u2019s contribution is matched six to one, meaning that a $175 contribution is actually worth $1,225 to the candidate. This magnifies the effect of small contributions enormously \u2014 and encourages candidates to seek them. The matching-funds program has worked well for nearly 20 years and has won high marks for helping to avoid the problem Mr. Vance is encountering.It would be relatively simple to integrate district attorney candidates into the New York City campaign finance system. State legislation (and funding) would be required, but the administrative structure is already in place. The city law has different contribution limits for each office, including a $3,850 limit on contributions to borough president campaigns \u2014 district attorneys also represent boroughwide constituencies and could be treated just the same. Even if the application of city campaign finance rules to district attorneys is limited initially to the five boroughs, we expect that before too long citizens elsewhere in the state will demand the same practice.Our experience leads us to strongly support the contribution limits and matching funds for district attorney campaigns. One of us was a City Council member who was elected under the city system and can attest to its value in eliminating candidates\u2019 reliance on big-money donors. The other of us won her first election as Brooklyn district attorney after having been a congresswoman and a candidate for United States Senate, with widespread support. She was not reliant on the defense bar, and in her re-election had only token opposition. Even though her situation was unusual, she could see from her experience on the job that there would be pressure to take contributions from interested lawyers.To be clear, we see no reason to conclude that campaign contributions are in fact influencing district attorneys decisions. But we do believe that public confidence has been significantly damaged by the recent coverage of Mr. Vance\u2019s donors. Perpetuating the current system will lead to further erosion of public trust and risks actual corruption. It is time to end that risk.Elizabeth Holtzman is a former congresswoman, Brooklyn district attorney and New York City comptroller.

{"Headline": "Hidden in the Senate Tax Bill: Surprise Gifts for Breweries and Start-Ups", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The revised Senate tax bill that arrived late Tuesday night brought unexpected gifts for craft breweries, tech start-ups and certain growers of citrus trees. Companies that house and maintain private aircraft and residents of the Mississippi River Delta who were harmed by flooding on August 11, 2016, also got special treatment.Those were not the headline provisions of the amendment, which also kills the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate and sets expiration dates on all of the individual tax cuts contained in the Senate bill released last week. They were pet issues of special-interest groups, championed by some members of the Senate Finance Committee, and the rare example thus far of lobbyists breaking through in their efforts to shape a tax proposal that is hurtling through Congress at warp speed.The House will vote Thursday on a tax bill it released just two weeks ago. Senate leaders say they are on track to vote on their version at the end of the month. The speed is a deliberate attempt by top Republicans to deliver a legislative victory before the New Year and, along the way, thwart attempts by lobbying groups to change the bills, in ways that could complicate prospects for passage.Thus far, lobbying groups and lawmakers agree, the strategy appears to be working \u2014 with some notable exceptions.The influential small-business lobbying group, the National Federation of Independent Business, has succeeded in reshaping tax breaks for businesses that are not organized as traditional corporations. Large multinationals won a partial rollback of a House attempt to tax some of their payments to foreign affiliates.And the Senate amendment, released on Tuesday by Senator Orrin Hatch, who heads the finance committee, included a scattering of carve-outs for interest groups large and small.Among those who stand to benefit are tech companies, who successfully pushed for changes to the treatment of stock options, which are heavily used by start-ups to compensate workers and investors. The Senate amendment introduced on Tuesday removed a provision in the original bill that would have taxed employee stock options upon vesting, instead of when they\u2019re \u201cexercised\u201d or cashed-in. Tech companies including Uber and Airbnb signed a letter arguing the provision was unfair to start-ups and their workers, since stock options are essentially paper wealth, not real money, and should not be taxed until they are exercised.Not only did the industry successfully lobby for the provision to be removed from both the House and Senate bills, it also won a proactive victory in the Senate bill, which now includes language sought by the industry giving more flexibility for exercising stock options, allowing employees seven years to pay tax obligations instead of having to pay taxes on the fair-market value of the shares at the time they were exercised.Mr. Engstrom said he thought the lobbying had an impact, despite the compressed time frame for moving the bill.\u201cIt didn\u2019t foreclose the possibility of lobbying all together,\u201d he said. He added, though, \u201cIt was a bit of a scramble, because we didn\u2019t really have a lot of visibility.\u201dSmaller trade groups have been particularly strained by the rapid pace, lobbyists working on the issue said. Such groups have fewer experts to quickly analyze complex legislative language, fewer lobbyists to try to change provisions that negatively impact their members and smaller budgets for flying in members to plead their cases directly.The groups that have had the most success shaping the legislation started long before the bills were unveiled this month.As soon as the association staff members got their hands on the bill, they sent it to the tax experts to assess the potential impacts on their companies, which include Target and Walmart. Some member companies raised specific questions and concerns about the excise tax provision, which called for a 20 percent tax on payments to foreign affiliates, according to Brian Dodge, an official at the association.\u201cAll of our companies have these experts, and they were able to go through it pretty quickly to evaluate the good, the bad and the indifferent,\u201d Mr. Dodge said. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t left to staff here to try to guess how our members might be affected.\u201dThe association\u2019s lobbyists relayed those concerns to the House Ways and Means Committee, and also helped connect executives from member companies with key lawmakers.Some of those concerns were assuaged in an amendment passed last week that clarified who would be impacted by the excise tax and also created a credit for foreign taxes paid by affected companies.The compressed time frame is not the only reason that powerful industry groups have been less able to shape the debate than in 1986, the last time Congress overhauled the tax code. Since then, well-financed ideological advocacy groups have become bigger players in legislative debates, including a raft of conservative groups that have lobbied hard to eliminate many industry specific carve outs.Still, some business groups have won changes in the bills.The Senate amendment included apparent victories for the Brewers Association, including a temporary reduction in the excise taxes levied on beer. The \u201cCRAFT beverage modernization\u201d provision, introduced by Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, would lower the tax rate on beer produced in the United States, particularly for small breweries. The amendment will lower the tax on beer to $16 per barrel on the first six million barrels brewed and lower it to $3.50 per barrel for small brewers on the first 60,000 barrels produced domestically.Some citrus growers also gained a tax break for the costs of replanting after disasters. Flooding victims along the Mississippi River Delta may choose to take some early disbursements from their tax-advantaged retirement accounts without penalty. And aircraft management service companies will be except from an aviation excise tax they are required to pay under current law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Math Problem Bedevils Republican Tax Rewrite", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 There is a math problem at the heart of the Republican Party\u2019s protracted introduction of a sprawling tax bill, and it grows, in part, from President Trump\u2019s two nonnegotiable demands.Mr. Trump has insisted on \u201cmassive\u201d tax cuts, including reducing the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and delivering a tax cut for the middle class. Both of those goals have proved difficult for the Republicans putting together the House version of the tax bill. They are running into political challenges as they try to offset lost revenue to stay within the confines of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that lawmakers have voted to allow.The tax rewrite is pitting businesses against individuals, as lawmakers look for ways to offset trillions of dollars of personal and corporate income tax cuts by limiting popular individual tax breaks, including preferential treatment for 401(k) plans and the state and local tax deduction. Business groups, meanwhile, say lawmakers run the risk of putting the United States at a global disadvantage if it does not reduce the corporate tax rate to a level commensurate with other industrialized nations.On Wednesday, lawmakers were discussing a potential bandage solution to buy themselves time to figure out the hard math. That solution would call for phasing in some rate cuts over a period of years, and making some cuts temporary, which would lessen the short- and long-term revenue hit. Industry groups familiar with the discussions said such a move was not meant to be the actual legislative solution, but rather a place holder that would allow Republican leaders to work out the details of a new set of revenue-raisers that would be inserted in the bill before the full House votes on it.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said that the intention was to make the corporate tax cut permanent, but that it might not appear that way immediately.\u201cThat\u2019s our goal,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to take several steps through the process to achieve that.\u201dMr. Trump has resisted a push to reduce the cost of the corporate cut \u2014 which is estimated to reduce revenues by $2 trillion over a decade \u2014 by phasing it in over time. Rank-and-file Republicans in the House have pushed back against efforts to raise revenues by limiting the amount of pretax dollars Americans can save in 401(k) retirement plans and limiting deductions for state and local taxes paid.That has set off a scramble to find more revenue.While Republican congressional leaders originally hoped that repealing the health law \u2014 and its taxes \u2014 would help make their tax overhaul easier, most have decided that injecting the toxic politics of health care into the tax effort could imperil their chances of getting a bill passed. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said on Wednesday that health care should be kept out of the tax bill. Mr. Brady has also expressed concerns about marrying the two.At a meeting that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin held with conservative leaders on Tuesday, he indicated that a repeal would be in the House plan, according to two people in attendance.As the Ways and Means Committee scurried to finish the bill by Thursday, Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina and the chief deputy whip, played down the significance of the one-day delay, while adding that Republicans were still on pace to move quickly.\u201cArbitrary deadlines do not work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw that with health care. We\u2019re not going to allow the idea of rolling out on a Wednesday rather than a Thursday determine something as substantive and as important as tax reform.\u201dRepresentative Tom MacArthur, Republican of New Jersey, said a plan was taking shape to resolve the conflict over the state and local tax deduction, which has threatened to derail the bill. Republican lawmakers from high-tax states have been adamant that the deduction remain largely intact or at least in some form that is acceptable to constituents. Mr. MacArthur said the plan would allow property taxes to be deducted, with a cap that he said needed to be higher than what had been sketched out.\u201cI\u2019m willing to accept the concept as long as it covers enough homes, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m after now,\u201d he said. Mr. MacArthur said the Ways and Means Committee appeared to be leaning toward a cap on the \u201camount of tax dollars that you can deduct,\u201d rather than a cap based on income, but he declined to specify a dollar figure.\u201cI think unless most of New York and New Jersey\u2019s on board, the bill has a problem,\u201d Mr. MacArthur said, \u201cbecause there\u2019s outliers on a whole bunch of other issues where they\u2019ll lose some votes \u2014 you know, a vote here, two votes there. You can\u2019t afford to lose the bulk of New York and New Jersey and have a bill go forward.\u201d\u201cTrust me if I tell you the bill is moving every hour,\u201d he said.Once the bill is released, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic lieutenants will fan out to make the case for tax cuts.Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, will give a midday speech to the Economic Club of Washington, while Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, will be in Los Angeles speaking to entrepreneurs at the International Franchise Association conference.Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the two officials would stay behind during his coming trip to Asia so that they could oversee the tax legislation.\u201cSo if I have any problems, I will be blaming Mnuchin and Cohn,\u201d Mr. Trump said ahead of a cabinet meeting.Lawmakers had not settled on a name for the bill on Wednesday afternoon, but outside groups said Mr. Trump had suggested \u201cThe Cut Cut Cut Act,\u201d which House leaders had rejected. Asked about that name at a news briefing on Wednesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, did not say whether Mr. Trump had made the suggestion.\u201cIf it\u2019s called \u2018Cut Cut Cut\u2019 and it includes massive tax cuts like this president is proposing,\u201d she said, \u201cI think we\u2019d perfectly be fine with that.\u201dJeremy W. Peters and Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The deadline to nominate directors is next month.Shares in Qualcomm ended the day up 3 percent, at $66.49.

My office will not stand by and let private consumer information be jeopardized by industry giants, especially to pad their profits.\u201dA Google spokesman, Patrick Lenihan, gave this statement:\u201cWe have not yet received the subpoena, however, we have strong privacy protections in place for our users and continue to operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment.\u201dGet ready for a potential battle to control one of America\u2019s biggest mall operators.GGP, formerly known as General Growth Properties, operates primarily upscale malls like Tysons Galleria in Virginia and Woodbridge Center in New Jersey.

Hence, why Anheuser-Busch is replacing the head of its United States subsidiary.The management changes mark a new phase for the company\u2019s U.S. operations, said Carlos Brito, chief executive of the Belgium-based behemoth. The first phase, after InBev\u2019s 2008 takeover of Anheuser-Busch, was aimed at cutting costs and paying off debt. The second focused on expanding the portfolio with craft beers and growing higher-end brands such as Stella Artois and Michelob Ultra, Mr. Brito said.Shares in the conglomerate closed down about 7.2 percent Monday, to $19.02.\u201cPerhaps the most encouraging development to be found in Mr. Flannery\u2019s 57-page slide show on Monday is a plan to put just 12 directors up for a vote next year, including three new ones.

That would make the core business of private equity \u2014 buying and selling companies, in deals financed to some degree with borrowed money \u2014 much more difficult.\u201cThere is no particular logic to the reforms.

{"Headline": "Why It\u2019s Hard to Get Strongmen to Step Down", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf history is anything to go by, life after leadership isn\u2019t straightforward for many strongmen, potentially complicating efforts to get them to step down.Whether it\u2019s to avoid prosecution, maintain wealth gained through corruption or in some cases avoid death at the hands of adversaries, many authoritarian leaders cling to their roles. Here\u2019s a look at some who fell from power and what happened to them after.Charles G. Taylor is an example of how hard it can be for an authoritarian leader to retire peacefully. A former warlord who became president of Liberia, Mr. Taylor led the country from 1997 to 2003. He ultimately resigned after international leaders intervened \u2014 and promised asylum \u2014 during talks between the government and rebel factions to try to end Liberia\u2019s war.\u201cHistory will be kind to me,\u201d Mr. Taylor said during his resignation, before being escorted out of the country by Ghana\u2019s president. Mr. Taylor left the country for Nigeria, where he had been offered asylum. \u201cI have accepted this role as the sacrificial lamb.\u201dBut things did not turn out as Mr. Taylor had hoped.Hosni Mubarak is another example of a leader who held power for years, stepped down \u2014 and ended up on trial.Mr. Mubarak was president of Egypt for 29 years, but faced a popular uprising during the Arab Spring of 2011. After 18 days of wide-scale protest in which thousands rallied daily in Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square, Mr. Mubarak stepped down in February 2011.Just two months later, the military government to which he handed power arrested him. The nation demanded he be held accountable for human rights abuses and corruption during his decades of rule.His trial is often cited as one reason President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who faced a popular uprising during the Arab Spring that has devolved into a protracted civil war, has refused to step down.Muammar el-Qaddafi offers another lesson: the risks of holding on too long.For 42 years, he ruled Libya. Then came the Arab Spring.Under Mr. Qaddafi, Libyan security forces cracked down on anti-government protesters who gathered on the streets of Benghazi, Libya\u2019s second largest city. The popular uprising in his country quickly spread, and when Mr. Qaddafi refused to budge, the protests evolved into a wide-scale civil war that eventually drew international intervention. In early 2011, he vowed to die as a martyr fighting to retain control of Libya.Just months later in October 2011, Mr. Qaddafi died at the hands of rebel groups while trying to flee.Joseph Kabila, the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, was supposed to step down last December at the end of his second term, as constitutionally mandated. But he refused, setting off a protracted political and economic crisis in his country.This decision to cling to the presidency may have less to do with his desire to lead the country than with his fears for his safety and his wealth. Mr. Kabila first came to office in 2001, after his father, Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, was assassinated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Bill de Blasio Overcame the Haters", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "Mayor de Blasio, despite his legion of critics, is striding toward re-election with a bloodless and boring campaign \u2014 just as he planned it.Supported byIt was the night before Thanksgiving last year when Bill de Blasio and Hakeem Jeffries met for a private dinner at Olea, a Mediterranean restaurant in Brooklyn.For Mr. de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, it was a chance to size up the congressman seen by many to be the most threatening challenger to his re-election \u2014 an African-American rising star from Brooklyn, who could cut into the mayor\u2019s base in the black community and his home borough.The meal stretched more than two hours into the night. The men snacked on tapas and bantered about rezoning, policing and the shock election of Donald Trump \u2014 although they never spoke explicitly about the potential for a head-on collision. \u201cIt was beneath the surface,\u201d Mr. Jeffries recalled in an interview, \u201cbut was never put on the table.\u201dWithin weeks, Mr. Jeffries would be elevated to the House Democratic leadership. Mr. de Blasio would call to offer his congratulations. And Mr. Jeffries would forgo running for mayor to stay in Washington for the national fight. \u201cIt became clear to me that New York City was strong enough to survive another four years of Bill de Blasio, whether you like him or not,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said. \u201cIt is not clear to me that the country can survive four years of Donald Trump.\u201dMr. Jeffries was hardly the only politician to take a pass on the 2017 mayor\u2019s race. One by one, all of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s most formidable would-be Democratic rivals \u2014 Mr. Jeffries, Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, and Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president \u2014 would decide against challenging him. The result was a landslide in the primary election this September: Mr. de Blasio thumped his second-tier opposition (led by Sal Albanese, who last held elected office in 1997) by the largest margin of any Democrat in decades.Now the mayor is on the cusp of a decisive re-election, facing a fractured field of G.O.P. and independent challengers in a listless general election that polls have him leading by more than 40 points. The Republican candidate who spent the most money running against Mr. de Blasio grew so dispirited with his chances that he dropped out months ago.In the waning days of the mayor\u2019s race that wasn\u2019t, the question gripping the New York political world is not so much who will win on Nov. 7 but how Mr. de Blasio pulled this off.How has a polarizing politician with so many vocal critics, who seemed in such peril at times, waltzed toward a second term? How did this mayor \u2014 a man who had to fend off dual federal and state investigations into his fund-raising practices, who earned a reputation for arrogance and lateness, who seemed at times more interested in national politics than municipal management, who has fought with the city\u2019s tabloids, who was protested by his own police force and who earned the enmity of the governor of his own party \u2014 so thoroughly scare everyone away?How did Bill de Blasio do it?Almost exactly 1,000 days before Mr. de Blasio won the Democratic nomination for a second term, he stepped into a Brooklyn hospital and knew he had a problem. Two New York police officers had just been killed \u2014 assassinated, really \u2014 at point-blank range. Mr. de Blasio had come, as mayors do, to pay his respects. But as he and his entourage squeezed into the hospital\u2019s corridors, something was off. Many of the men and women in blue standing in solidarity with the fallen were facing the wall, their backs to the mayor in protest.It amounted to a political tinderbox for a rookie mayor whom few had expected to win in 2013, when Mr. de Blasio vaulted past a crowded field in a crazy race marked by Anthony Weiner\u2019s implosion and Christine Quinn\u2019s collapse. In his first year, Mr. de Blasio was facing not only a political crisis but also a genuine security situation months after violence had engulfed Ferguson, Mo.Throughout December of 2014, the mayor and his team huddled deep into the night at Gracie Mansion to come up with a way to defuse the situation. Efforts included enlisting the help of Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, who held mass at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral the morning after the mayor\u2019s hospital visit, and urged calm in \u201ca city tempted by tension and division.\u201d In a symbolic but unscripted moment, Cardinal Dolan emerged from the church arm in arm with the mayor\u2019s wife, Chirlane McCray, who is African-American.In the end, riots did not break out, and Mr. de Blasio\u2019s stewardship through a racially fraught situation solidified his standing among his most important constituency, African-American voters, according to his political advisers.Peter Ragone, a top City Hall adviser in 2014 who has stayed close to the mayor, said the political foundation for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s re-election has always been solid despite the naysayers.\u201cI don\u2019t believe he was ever vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Ragone said flatly.The city\u2019s economy has been humming. Crime has been dwindling. And Mr. de Blasio delivered on two signature first-term promises: universal prekindergarten for 70,000 students and curtailing stop-and-frisk. More affordable housing is being built and those facing eviction will soon be guaranteed city-provided lawyers.Crucially, term limits also made waiting for 2021 \u2014 when there would be no incumbent mayor \u2014 more alluring for officials like Mr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz Jr.\u201cI have been stunned by the level of cognitive dissonance between the reality that political insiders believe and the reality that the rest of the electorate has believed all along,\u201d Mr. Ragone said. \u201cThat somehow going to the gym is more important than universal pre-K, or somehow the fact that he ate a very large messy slice of pizza with a knife and a fork is going to disqualify him in a single voter\u2019s mind.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t so much the pizza that bothered Bradley Tusk as the subpoenas.Mr. Tusk had served as campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and before that as top deputy to Rod R. Blagojevich, the Illinois governor who went to prison for corruption. He likes to say he\u2019s seen good politicians and bad ones: \u201cI know what it\u2019s like under each.\u201dIn Mr. de Blasio, he saw a bad one \u2014 and no one would do more to enlist a challenger to the mayor than Mr. Tusk.\u201cIt seemed to me that we had really lackluster leadership,\u201d he said in an interview.Two months later, Mr. Tusk then took the extraordinary step of announcing a public recruiting drive, financed by his own fortune (he struck gold with early equity in Uber), to find a top-tier Democratic challenger to the mayor. Mr. Tusk dangled a super PAC if the right candidate jumped in.The type of things Mr. Ragone saw as insignificant, Mr. Tusk saw as symbolic of a disengaged executive \u201cwho didn\u2019t seem to care that much about the job.\u201d He chafed as the mayor tried and failed to host a presidential forum in Iowa and rolled out a national agenda that went nowhere.He paid for a poll showing Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Stringer virtually tied \u2014 41 percent to 40 percent. He surveyed other names, too, including Mr. Jeffries, Mr. Diaz Jr., the city\u2019s public advocate Letitia James and even some unlikelier ones, such as the Rev. Al Sharpton and Joe Scarborough, the MSNBC host.Mr. Tusk would meet with just about every possible challenger (only once each, on the advice of his lawyers), including Mr. Jeffries, Mr. Diaz Jr., Mr. Stringer, Ms. Quinn, and Daniel R. Garodnick, a Manhattan city councilman.\u201cI think they all felt they would be a better mayor than de Blasio; I think they all would like the job,\u201d Mr. Tusk said. \u201cBut it came with a cost.\u201dIn his meeting with Mr. Jeffries, Mr. Tusk said their conversation quickly turned to the fact that the New York mayoralty has historically served as more of a career capstone than as a steppingstone. Mr. Jeffries is now only 47. \u201cHakeem \u2014 that kind of threw him for a loop,\u201d Mr. Tusk recalled. \u201cWe both realized at the same time that success for him might not mean success.\u201dMr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz Jr. had the opposite problem: both would have had to risk their current offices to challenge the mayor. Losing meant they\u2019d be out of a job.If Mr. Tusk was the face of the anti-de Blasio effort, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was stoking the same sentiment behind the scenes. The Cuomo-de Blasio relationship had been strained from the start, but it took a turn for the worse in mid-2015 when the mayor ripped the governor in the press. \u201cIf someone disagrees with him openly,\u201d Mr. de Blasio sniped, \u201csome kind of revenge or vendetta follows.\u201dHe was talking about the past. He might as well have been predicting the future.Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, said: \u201cThe governor has been close with Congressman Jeffries since he was an Assembly member on a professional and personal level, and the same goes for his relationship with Borough President Diaz Jr. And neither were ever going to run for mayor.\u201dAccording to Mr. Tusk, Mr. Stringer looked most seriously at the contest.At about that time, Mr. Stringer was sitting on $1.4 million in his campaign account that could have been spent on a mayoral run, just shy of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s $1.6 million.Mr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz Jr. declined requests to comment.But three people who spoke directly with Mr. Stringer during that time said he was explicit about his interest in entering the race on one very speculative condition: He would run for mayor if Mr. de Blasio was indicted on criminal charges.No number proved more daunting and prohibitive for would-be challengers than Mr. de Blasio\u2019s support among black voters, which has hovered around 75 percent, sometimes even higher. Political operatives projected that African-Americans would comprise close to 30 percent of the Democratic primary electorate in 2017 and if the mayor won 75 percent of those votes he\u2019d be nearly halfway toward winning.Put another way, if Mr. de Blasio carried three-quarters of the black vote, a theoretical opponent would need to win a nearly impossible 61 percent of the vote from everyone else to beat him \u2014 a near impossibility against an incumbent, especially one who counted the backing of key labor unions and solid support in the Latino community.The math simply didn\u2019t work unless someone could crack his hold on black voters.That was the great allure of Mr. Jeffries, who had the potential to cut into the mayor\u2019s margins and also appeal to white liberals. \u201cJeffries would have been a much, much, much more problematic candidate for us,\u201d acknowledged an adviser to the mayor. \u201cHe was the one that made people most nervous.\u201dMr. Cuomo spoke regularly with Mr. Jeffries during this period. When asked if Mr. Cuomo had encouraged him to run against Mr. de Blasio, the congressman replied carefully. \u201cThe governor never directly encouraged me to run for any office beyond the one that I hold,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we would often talk about the landscape throughout the city, the state and the nation.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Tusk was dubious about the strength of the mayor\u2019s polling, which dates to the 2013 campaign and Mr. de Blasio\u2019s memorable ad that prominently featured his biracial son\u2019s Afro. \u201cHe\u2019s not Barack Obama,\u201d Mr. Tusk said of the mayor. \u201cThis notion that it\u2019s inviolate is crazy.\u201d\u201cThat was before anyone threw a punch at him,\u201d added Mr. Tusk. But first he needed to find a politician willing to get in the ring \u2014 and he was running out of time.As federal and state prosecutors continued their probes, Mr. de Blasio set out to control what he could: raising money and collecting endorsements.A New York Times analysis of the mayor\u2019s calendar shows more than 240 hours of \u201ccall time\u201d between June 2016 and May 2017, a designation often used for calling donors. That is an average of nearly 40 minutes of call time every day, seven days a week, for the entire year.By January 2017, Mr. de Blasio declared a campaign treasury of $2.2 million \u2014 enough to ward off challengers, his team hoped.The thinking in the mayor\u2019s orbit was simple. Mr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz Jr. were seen as traditional, risk-averse, even conventional foes. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s team just needed to make an open race for mayor in 2021 seem more appealing than challenging the mayor in 2017.To do so, they systematically sought to lock up the support of the city\u2019s most influential unions.\u201cCertainly there is a political benefit at the end of the day for doing the right thing by labor unions,\u201d Mr. Ragone acknowledged.\u201cAny potential candidate who saw the large coalition of support from organized labor that the mayor was building early and fast likely thought twice about jumping into the fray,\u201d said Phil Walzak, a mayoral spokesman.Mr. Jeffries said the shock election of Mr. Trump was more important than any endorsements in sapping the energy for a major squabble between Democrats in 2017. \u201cIn my view, the absence of a serious mayoral race is directly related to the election of Donald Trump as president,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said. \u201cPeriod. Full stop.\u201dOthers point to a different decisive character: Preet Bharara, who was then the U.S. Attorney leading the federal investigation into the de Blasio campaign\u2019s finances.\u201cDid we know there was an investigation?\u201d asked Christine C. Quinn, the former City Council speaker who lost in Mr. de Blasio\u2019s upset victory in 2013. \u201cDid we know there was chatter that people were saying there could be an indictment, there could be an acquittal, et cetera? Well, of course we did. It would be absurd to tell you we did not. And maybe if there had been an indictment, it would have changed people\u2019s calculations. But it\u2019s not like I was sitting around hitting refresh on my computer every three seconds to see what was happening in the courthouse.\u201dMs. Quinn said she never seriously looked at the race. \u201cThere was no kitchen cabinet,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no team assembled. It wasn\u2019t like that.\u201dWhat neither she nor any of the other potential challengers were doing during the 11 months of the probe was building a case for why Mr. de Blasio needed to be tossed from office.In a paradoxical way, the investigations actually helped the mayor: it froze his foes on the sidelines for the most critical months.\u201cThe other individuals who were being mentioned as potential candidates didn\u2019t appear to be developing real messages or plans for a campaign \u2014 they were mostly waiting and seeing,\u201d said Mr. Walzak, adding that de Blasio aides were \u201c100 percent confident\u201d that \u201clegal reviews underway would result in no action.\u201d\u201cBill de Blasio is a man of significant political talent,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said, \u201cbut he has also been particularly fortunate as events have unfolded throughout the duration of his career.\u201dIn recent days, one of the mayor\u2019s biggest donors, Jona S. Rechnitz, testified as a witness in a different corruption case of how he had bought influence in the de Blasio administration. He boasted in vivid detail about asking for favors from City Hall, including calling the mayor\u2019s personal cellphone, although he would struggle with consistency under cross-examination.The episode came seven months too late for Mr. Tusk. He had declared his recruitment efforts dead within hours of prosecutors dropping the case back in March. \u201cWe should therefore expect four more years of Bill de Blasio,\u201d Mr. Tusk said then. That day, his campaign\u2019s Twitter account went silent. He let his website lapse long before votes were cast.That left Nicole Malliotakis, a 36-year-old assemblywoman from Staten Island, as the party\u2019s standard-bearer. Bo Dietl, a retired police detective, tried to run as a Republican but was rebuffed by party officials. He\u2019s now on the ballot as an independent \u2014 diluting the anti-de Blasio vote.\u201cHe\u2019s facing two candidates to his right spending almost as much time elbowing each other as they are going after the mayor,\u201d said Bruce Gyory, a veteran New York lobbyist and political operative.Ms. Malliotakis has struggled to modulate between hard-line conservative policies and more moderate stands that could help her citywide but could endanger her political future on Staten Island or statewide. She sided with the president against football players kneeling during the national anthem. \u201cTrump is right,\u201d she said.At times, the general election has felt like a sideshow. Ms. Malliotakis fractured her foot in an attempt to avoid stepping on her pet Chihuahua. News emerged that the Libertarian candidate once tried to hijack a plane at Kennedy International Airport and demanded to be taken to Antarctica. Mr. Dietl screamed so much at the first debate that his microphone was cut off but not before he offered the mayor, whom he typically derides as \u201cBig Bird,\u201d a compliment on his signature achievement. \u201cThe only good thing he ever did was \u2014 I like that pre-K stuff,\u201d Dietl said.The mayor might fumble some of the easiest elements of political stagecraft, but he ultimately left little substantive opening for his detractors.After four years of uninterrupted economic growth and relative political stability, maybe a challenge was never in the offing \u2014 no matter the decisions of Mr. Jeffries or Mr. Stringer or Mr. Diaz Jr. or anyone else, except perhaps Mr. Bharara.On the Friday after the September primary, Mr. Stringer, who is a virtual lock to run for mayor in 2021, visited Mr. Tusk\u2019s Manhattan offices. Mr. Tusk was still smarting over 2017\u2019s missed opportunities and saw the mayor\u2019s four no-name challengers\u2019 25 percent of the vote as halfway to victory \u2014 a particularly bullish glass-half-full perspective.\u201cYou should have run!\u201d Mr. Tusk recalled shouting at the comptroller as he entered the room. \u201cYou could have won!\u201dMr. Stringer only laughed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Internships Don\u2019t Pay, Some Colleges Will", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the child of a divorced, unemployed mother, Shira Eisenberg learned to get by, she says, \u201con the kindness of strangers.\u201d But even she was surprised when she arrived at the University of Chicago and was told that if she jumped through a few hoops, like going to seminars on how to behave at a job interview, she would be guaranteed a paid internship, financed by the university if no other source of money was available.\u201cWithout the stipend, I would not have been able to afford it,\u201d said Ms. Eisenberg, a sophomore majoring in computer science and minoring in neuroscience.Internships have become a necessary credential in a highly competitive job market \u2014 about half of interns are offered a job by a company where they have interned, according to a 2017 survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.But for those thinking of careers in nonprofits, public service, social services or the arts, paid opportunities are scarce. Employers often can\u2019t afford a stipend, and many students can\u2019t afford to work for free.In response, campuses are using philanthropy and their own funds to subsidize internships at organizations that have a mission of social change or innovation. Students can pursue their passion without worry about how they will pay for food and housing, and for those who see Goldman Sachs in their future, it\u2019s a chance to do good works.\u201cWe don\u2019t want our students to pick a field because it pays and overlook another field because it doesn\u2019t pay for an internship,\u201d said Meredith Daw, executive director of career advancement at the University of Chicago.There are 2,000 placements each year through Chicago\u2019s Jeff Metcalf Internship Program. Employers agree to cover the salary \u2014 at least $11 an hour or the local minimum wage, whichever is higher. But when an organization can\u2019t afford to pay \u2014 40 percent can\u2019t \u2014 the university provides a $4,000 grant for a 10-week stint.Starting last year, the university\u2019s Odyssey Scholars \u2014 low-income students like Ms. Eisenberg \u2014 have been guaranteed a paid internship for their first summer. That, Ms. Daw said, is when they are at the greatest disadvantage compared to their peers with more of the social capital \u2014 like parental connections \u2014 needed to find internships on their own. Last summer, 232 students participated.Ms. Eisenberg interned at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where she developed a machine learning model for its library. The grant helped defray airfare, her summer sublet and other expenses.Pace University posted more than 4,000 internships last year, about 40 percent of them unpaid, and provides grants for many internships in the nonprofit sector.Students in the Wilson internship program receive $16 an hour, or $4,480 for eight weeks. Some 120 students have participated since 2009, with grants totaling about $500,000.Macalester College, too, subsidizes internships involving social missions, like helping integrate tuberculosis services into Georgia\u2019s health system and fighting transgender discrimination. Last year, about 50 interns took part.\u201cThis is an opportunity to try on a career no matter what their interest or major or their economic situation is,\u201d said Mindy Deardurff, dean of career development at the St. Paul campus. \u201cEspecially for our students who have socioeconomic need, if we can get them in and let them try out some of the things they are so passionate about, it might get them over that hump of worrying about whether they can afford it.\u201dAmherst College distributed $1 million this past summer, 40 percent more than it did the previous year, helping 229 students take unpaid internships with nonprofit organizations and small start-ups. The money came from alumni gifts and $200,000 from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which supports low-income college students.Because more than 80 percent of Amherst students go to graduate or professional school, some of the money is used to prepare them by financing research internships, study abroad and independently devised programs, said Emily C. Griffen, director of Amherst\u2019s Loeb Center for Career Exploration and Planning.Michael Loeb, president and chief executive of Loeb Enterprises, is an alumnus who has taken a particular interest in internships. In addition to offering paid stints at his own company, he has just started a program that matches start-ups in New York City with Amherst interns and covers their pay and living expenses.It\u2019s not surprising that alumni favor their alma mater.Over the past five years, alumni and parents have donated $4 million to Colgate University, enabling it to support some 200 students each year who want to take unpaid or low-paid internships, typically with nonprofits, the creative arts or to do research. Last summer, it spent $666,000, said Michael Sciola, associate vice president of institutional advancement and career initiatives. Colgate students can also come up with their own grant proposal, and the university will help them find a host who will turn that into an internship.\u201cWe do allow students to do a self-designed summer,\u201d he said. For example, twin brothers received a grant to pay for travel to work on an archaeological expedition in Alaska.Mr. Sciola concedes that the connection between \u201can immersive experience\u201d and a career might be less obvious than with an internship in the financial industry. That\u2019s why students are more likely to take less career-driven internships in their first and second years, he said, when they are still exploring.\u201cOur overall goal is to empower our students to explore their interests with practical immersive experiences,\u201d he said, \u201cwithout the limitation of financial barriers.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified who spoke about opening student eyes to different economic sectors. It was Rebecca Tekula, executive director of Pace\u2019s Wilson Center for Social Entrepreneurship, not Phyllis Mooney, executive director of career services.Anemona Hartocollis is an education reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Needs City Hall, Anyway? Bo Dietl Still Has His Table at Rao\u2019s", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was getting toward the end of the night at Rao\u2019s, the hedonistic swirl of food, banter, profanity and singalongs finally dying down, affording Bo Dietl the rare chance for reflection.He leaned against the bar, his usual pink drink of Ketel One, club soda and cranberry juice in hand, his mind on the New York City of old and the race for mayor that could have been.\u201cMemories are so beautiful,\u201d he said, punctuating his comment with one of many unprintable words and phrases heard that night. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love about falling asleep and dreaming. The old days was a lot better. You didn\u2019t have some towel-head running you over.\u201dHe added, as if to acknowledge his offensive remark about a terror attack in New York days before Election Day: \u201cI\u2019m so happy I\u2019m not running for mayor. I can say what I want.\u201dFor Mr. Dietl, as for other regulars, the restaurant remains a kind of refuge, a place out of time where there is no menu, nearly every diner breaks into song when the jukebox begins playing its usual list of Sinatra and standards, and Christmas decorations hang year-round \u2014 a quirk born, the owner said, of some long-ago laziness that grew into a signature d\u00e9cor.It is a place where bygones can be bygones, and Bo can be Bo.It is also, perhaps, the one place where Mr. Dietl could plausibly claim to be mayor. Men and women \u2014 but mostly men \u2014 crouched to kiss his cheek and offer words of encouragement as they entered and left through the restaurant\u2019s red doors, a path that forced all to pass by Mr. Dietl, who sat in his usual perch at Table 1, reserved for him every Thursday night, by the front door.\u201cI agree with everything he says,\u201d said a longtime Rao\u2019s regular, Gigi Napolitano, 75, who grew up next door to the East Harlem restaurant.Another praised Mr. Dietl. \u201cThe debates were great,\u201d said the man, referring to the two raucous televised mayoral debates in which Mr. Dietl shared the stage with Mayor Bill de Blasio and the Republican candidate, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis.\u201cThank you, Lou,\u201d Mr. Dietl replied.\u201cA little quiet,\u201d the man observed sardonically.\u201cIf I was any more animated, I would have punched him in the face,\u201d Mr. Dietl said.\u201cRao\u2019s has been responsible for my life taking off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not cop and wiseguys. It was like family.\u201dFor much of the campaign, and his life before, Mr. Dietl has traded on his table at Rao\u2019s. He has given it up for charity, and offered it as a inducement during his mayoral campaign to donors though there were no takers. \u201cThat didn\u2019t work too good,\u201d he admitted.\u201cHey, there\u2019s my heart doctor!\u201d Mr. Dietl said of a man leaving the restaurant.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a heart,\u201d the man replied. (He confirmed his medical relationship to Mr. Dietl but declined to give his name.)\u201cThis is poliphical,\u201d he said, grasping for a word \u2014 and coming up with a garble \u2014 to capture how applicable he found the words of a former president to his own poor electoral performance. \u201cThe credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,\u201d he read, barking in his usual cadence above the restaurant din and the jukebox crooning \u201cMy Way.\u201dDuring a singalong to \u201cMy Girl,\u201d Mr. Dietl sang heartily, substituting a different answer to the question, \u201cWhat can make me feel this way?\u201d\u201cViagra!\u201d Mr. Dietl joked.Mr. Murstein detailed his years of trying to secure a spot in the restaurant. Now that he is friends with Mr. Dietl, he comes regularly, and said he had dined with the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and the former baseball player Hank Aaron.\u201cI like Donald,\u201d Mr. Dietl said. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of like me. He tells you what he feels, and it\u2019s not politically correct.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so right,\u201d Ms. Napolitano said, laughing.\u201cI\u2019ll never run again. I hate politics,\u201d he said.Mr. Dietl left the restaurant with leftovers in a plastic bag. His silver Mercedes sat double-parked in front, where it had been for the duration of the meal.

{"Headline": "As Sponsors Shy Away, FIFA Faces World Cup Shortfall", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sport is more popular than ever. What is different this time is FIFA\u2019s reputation.In fact, one has to go back to 2011 to find the last new partner based in either Europe or the United States \u2014 a one-tournament deal signed by Johnson & Johnson. And since Gianni Infantino swept to power in 2016 in the wake of the corruption crisis, FIFA has managed to secure marquee deals only with companies in countries set to host the World Cup (Russia and Qatar) and another (China) that hopes to do so.That geographic spread tells its own story, according to Patrick Nally, a sports sponsorship executive who helped set up FIFA\u2019s first international marketing program four decades ago.\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising it\u2019s been and still is a toxic brand,\u201d Nally said. \u201cUnless you are from China or somewhere like that, where the fact FIFA is in court in New York and associated with corruption doesn\u2019t matter, no corporation is going to consider it safe to get involved with FIFA.\u201dIn fact, Nally said, FIFA\u2019s association with corrupt behavior now runs so deep that he suggested the 113-year-old F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association should consider a name change.\u201cWhy not?\u201d Nally said. \u201cThey need to get bright thinkers to repackage the whole thing. There\u2019s just too much baggage to carry. It\u2019s just an absolute mass of information about corruption wherever you look. The word FIFA globally has got just the worst image in the world: If you are trying to sell the FIFA brand, if anything those four letters stand for absolute total corruption and it\u2019s so unattractive.\u201dBut an apparent lack of interest among Russian businesses is hurting FIFA. Currently there are only two sponsors from the 2018 host country: the energy giant Gazprom is a top-tier partner, and Alfa Bank is FIFA\u2019s only regional partner, the lowest designation of three categories of sponsorship. Local partners are crucial not just in financing the event but also in building excitement among fans in the host country, something that has been distinctly absent in Russia so far.And with just over six months until the World Cup\u2019s opening game, time is also against FIFA. In 2016, Wanda paid $150 million in 2016 to sign up as one of FIFA\u2019s eight top-tier \u201cpartners,\u201d but the last of those places \u2014 not to mention two of the six places for second-level \u201csponsors\u201d \u2014 remains open.\u201cIf you are going to do a big deal and want to activate, it\u2019s really late,\u201d said Tim Crow, who recently stepped down as the chief executive of Synergy, a firm that has advised Olympic and World Cup sponsors. \u201cYou normally want your campaign in the market now, or by January and February; what\u2019s more, it can take anywhere from six months to a year to plan it all.\u201dThus convincing a company to make a $150 million bet on FIFA at this point is a tough sell. Further complicating matters is the protracted and unprecedented standoff with Russian broadcasters who continue to balk at FIFA\u2019s $100 million price tag for the domestic rights to next year\u2019s tournament, as well as international financial sanctions against prominent Russian businessmen and companies that can complicate doing business in the country. FIFA has hired external consultants to ensure those rules are not broken.The financial headache comes at a critical time for FIFA, and for its president. Infantino\u2019s election victory was built in part on his promise of almost $1 billion in financial handouts for the organization\u2019s 211 member associations. Those promises, and the continued legal costs linked to the corruption scandal, make the success of the 2018 tournament vital to Infantino\u2019s plan to win re-election in 2019.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No War Threats From Trump, Who Tells Koreans \u2018It Will All Work Out\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction, we will not be intimidated, and we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure,\u201d Mr. Trump said, evoking memories of the Korean War. \u201cTo those nations that choose to ignore this threat \u2014 or, worse still, to enable it \u2014 the weight of this crisis is on your conscience.\u201dIn a speech that mostly steered clear of his usual invective toward Mr. Kim, whose grandfather Kim Il-sung was the North\u2019s first leader, Mr. Trump nonetheless had a sharp message for him. \u201cThe weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer; they are putting your regime in grave danger,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face. North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned; it is a hell that no person deserves.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s plans for a surprise visit to the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea were foiled on Wednesday morning by bad weather, stripping him of a chance to project toughness toward the North as past American presidents have done while peering through binoculars toward a pariah state.The White House took pains to shroud the trip in secrecy, barring reporters traveling with him from divulging it until it had ended, but as the Marine One helicopter drew close to the demilitarized zone, dense fog prevented it from landing, sending a frustrated president back to Seoul.The aborted stop left Mr. Trump without a powerful image to end his visit to South Korea, devised in part to turn down the temperature on tensions in the region.After a day of private meetings and public bonding with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who was elected promising a shift toward dialogue with the North, Mr. Trump \u2014 who as recently as last month tweeted that direct talks were a \u201cwaste of time\u201d \u2014 said on Tuesday that it would be in the North\u2019s interest to \u201ccome to the table and to make a deal.\u201dAnd instead of threatening muscular pre-emptive action against the North, Mr. Trump said he prayed that using military force would not be necessary.\u201cI think we\u2019re making a lot of progress, I think we\u2019re showing great strength, I think they understand we have unparalleled strength,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the North during a news conference with Mr. Moon. Noting that the United States military has positioned three aircraft carriers and a nuclear submarine in the Pacific, he added: \u201cWe have many things happening that we hope, we hope \u2014 in fact, I\u2019ll go a step further \u2014 we hope to God we never have to use.\u201dWhen pressed by a reporter, Mr. Trump declined to say whether he still thought negotiations with North Korea would be a waste of time, making an uncharacteristic effort to avoid a remark that might have inflamed simmering hostility.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that \u2014 I just don\u2019t want to say that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou can understand.\u201dHis visit to Seoul was the most diplomatically challenging leg of Mr. Trump\u2019s 12-day, five-country trip through Asia, bringing him face to face with a public and a president wary of his combative approach on North Korea. To many of Mr. Moon\u2019s progressive supporters, Mr. Trump poses as much of a threat to peace as Mr. Kim, if not more so.\u201cDon\u2019t come, Trump! You talk about war whenever you open your mouth,\u201d a large banner read during a protest near the United States Embassy in Seoul on Tuesday. \u201cGo away, Trump!\u201d hundreds of labor activists and other progressives shouted in downtown Seoul, where thousands of police officers were deployed to keep security. \u201cNo Trump, no war!\u201dA short distance away, across a police blockade, hundreds of conservatives welcomed Mr. Trump with South Korean and American flags. South Korean conservatives are skeptical of Mr. Moon\u2019s approach, calling it na\u00efve. They back Mr. Trump\u2019s hawkish view of the North, but they, too, stop short of supporting war.\u201cWe believe in Trump!\u201d their signs read.Mr. Trump\u2019s restrained tone may have an easy explanation: He has been at odds with Mr. Moon, who took office in May, about how to deal with the North, and he was eager to avoid any public demonstration of the split.Mr. Trump and his aides fumed, and the president suggested Mr. Moon was practicing appeasement. The White House view is that the only way the North will relent is if it believes Mr. Trump is perfectly willing to order a strike on the country\u2019s nuclear facilities, even if that risks hundreds of thousands of casualties.But to let that difference in approach spill out into the open would have played right into North Korea\u2019s hands. It has tried, over nearly seven decades, to break the alliance. So the two leaders decided to stick to common, long-range goals.Mr. Trump\u2019s change in tone notwithstanding, his advisers have been making the case that North Korea\u2019s ambition is to reunify the Korean Peninsula by force, and that traditional deterrence cannot stop the North once it has a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States.Many observers are skeptical of both assertions, especially in South Korea, which would suffer greatly if a pre-emptive strike on the North led to all-out war. They argue that the leaders of North Korea\u2019s Communist government are not planning to use nuclear weapons to attack the United States or its allies, because they know that Washington would launch an overwhelming counterattack. Rather, they say, North Korea is building its nuclear weapons out of fear, hoping that the arms will protect the country from invasion \u2014 or from outside intervention, in the case of a domestic uprising \u2014 allowing the North to focus on economic development.\u201cThe view that North Korea would start war to communize Korea doesn\u2019t make sense anymore,\u201d said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. \u201cNorth Korea knows that if it ever uses a nuclear weapon, it means self-destruction.\u201dSouth Korean officials said they hoped that Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Seoul, a city of 10 million people, would bring home to him the consequences of a potential war. Mr. Moon supports Mr. Trump\u2019s call for \u201cmaximum\u201d sanctions and pressure, but says that those alone will never persuade North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.American officials in the region, too, were hoping the president\u2019s trip would help Mr. Trump gain a new perspective on how Seoul and Tokyo view the threat from up close; the regional trends affecting Asia beyond North Korea, including Chinese assertiveness; and the costs and consequences of military action, according to one American official.From a dining hall at Camp Humphreys, where Mr. Trump had lunch with troops, to the Blue House, where he met with Mr. Moon, everything he saw on Tuesday could become a fiery battlefield in the event of a military exchange with North Korea.But if the firsthand experience left an impression on Mr. Trump, he did not show it. At times, his tone was almost blithe. Before being briefed by American and South Korean military commanders, he said of the confrontation with the North: \u201cUltimately it will all work out. Because it always works out \u2014 has to work out.\u201d Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, the American commander, wore a grim expression as he listened.Mr. Trump also reprised his role as the American defense industry\u2019s chief salesman. \u201cSouth Korea will be ordering billions of dollars of that equipment, which, frankly, for them makes a lot of sense,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for us, it means jobs; it means reducing our trade deficit with South Korea.\u201dMr. Trump added about North Korea, \u201cIt is unacceptable that nations would help to arm and finance this increasingly dangerous regime.\u201dThe sex slave issue is one of the most contentious dividing Japan and South Korea, and the islets \u2014 known as Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan \u2014 lie at the center of a territorial dispute.As Mr. Trump arrived in Seoul, there was renewed evidence of activity at a site in North Korea where the North has conducted underground nuclear tests. But it was unclear whether the activity suggested another imminent test or construction on a tunnel that could be used for tests.David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

That provides the banks with \u201cbuffers as much as 10x higher than a decade,\u201d writes S&P Global.But these financial instutions have also gotten much larger since the financial crisis.In the United States, for example, JPMorgan Chase has nearly doubled in size since the end of 2006. Bank of America has increased its asset by more than 50 percent, and Wells Fargo\u2019s assets are up more than 300 percent from their pre-crisis levels, according to S&P Global.Much of those increases are a result of deals struck during the heights of the crisis. JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual; Bank of America acquired CountryWide and Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo purchased Wachovia.Still the size of these banks is noteworthy.

Just 16% think the value of bitcoin will double in the next six months.\u2022 \u201cA sizeable minority of respondents (39 \u2013 40 percent) see bitcoin as a potential analog to physical gold, both as a safe haven and a hedge against mistakes in central bank monetary policy,\u201d Mr. Colas writrs.

If officials have their way, Tito\u2019s boat will become a museum to display the complex history of Rijeka and serve as a point of pride for the nation.Tito used the yacht, built in 1938 in Genoa, Italy, as his floating residence, Yugoslavia\u2019s embassy and a party boat. He hosted soirees on it for world leaders and Hollywood stars like Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. To some liberal politicians in Croatia, the restored yacht, 380 feet long, would be the perfect symbol of Tito\u2019s ties to the city and the region. But far-right nationalists equate Tito with an oppressive Yugoslavia, which violently disintegrated after his death in 1980 at 87.\u201cIn 25 years of democratic nation states that have risen from the ashes of socialist Yugoslavia,\u201d Mr. Romac declared, \u201cnone of their leaders have come close to matching Tito\u2019s achievements.\u201dCroatia seceded in 1991, and a war of independence morphed into an ethnic bloodletting that engulfed the region for a decade. Croatia emerged from those tumultuous years into the embrace of the European Union, joining the bloc in 2013.In the past 100 years, the city has been part of multiple states \u2014 including the Austrian-Hungarian empire and the Nazi-allied Independent State of Croatia. After the Federal People\u2019s Republic of Yugoslavia was established in 1945, the city was officially made part of Croatia. \u201cI have my life and career ahead of me,\u201d he said. \u201cI want politicians to look for solutions to the problems of the present and leave the past to historians.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the creation of Yugoslavia. While Josip Broz Tito is credited with establishing the modern state of Yugoslavia in 1945, the country was formed after World War I.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shocking: Trump Makes the Right Choice With Jerome Powell", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPerhaps not surprisingly, President Trump seemed to treat the appointment of a new head of the Federal Reserve \u2014 arguably the most important personnel decision he has faced \u2014 a bit like a season of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d dangling tantalizing hints before handing the rose to Jerome H. Powell.In doing so, Mr. Trump, more surprisingly, picked by far the better suited of his two semipublic finalists.That\u2019s because Mr. Powell, a current member of the Federal Reserve Board, resides firmly in the camp of supporters of the Fed\u2019s policy of maintaining its low interest policy as long as inflation stays muted and wage increases remain stubbornly small.The other candidate \u2014 the economist John B. Taylor, the reported choice of Vice President Mike Pence and other hard-line conservatives \u2014 is openly hawkish, having warned for years that the central bank\u2019s easy money policy was stoking future inflation.Most prominently, in November 2010, Mr. Taylor was among 24 signatories to an open letter to Ben Bernanke, then the chairman, attacking a signature aspect of the Fed\u2019s efforts to stimulate a sluggish economy, its \u201cquantitative easing\u201d program of purchasing debt in the market to keep interest rates low.These purchases \u201crisk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed\u2019s objective of promoting employment,\u201d the group wrote.That was wrong in 2010 and is still wrong today. In the intervening seven years, 16 million jobs have been created. Meanwhile, inflation, which was running just over 1 percent when the letter was written, has barely budged.In a recent study, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis came to a similar conclusion: Had the central bank followed Mr. Taylor\u2019s prescription, the higher interest rates that he advocates would have resulted in 2.5 million more Americans being out of work today \u2014 enough, the Minneapolis bank observed, to fill all 31 National Football League stadiums at the same time.However, neither is Mr. Powell excessively dovish; he has not dissented from any Fed decision since becoming a governor in May 2012, including the four recent interest rate increases.Perhaps the biggest question mark swirling around Mr. Powell is that he is not a trained economist. The short reign of the last Federal Reserve chair to lack a deep background in economics, G. William Miller, was disastrous: In 1979, he was outvoted by his own board when he opposed an interest-rate increase that was, in retrospect, badly needed to combat raging inflation.But Mr. Miller had scant previous experience in Washington or in finance; Mr. Powell, a lawyer and, later, a partner at the investment firm Carlyle Group, has substantial amounts of both, including at the Treasury Department.That distinguishes him from many other Trump picks with their more modest qualifications for their posts.Mr. Powell is also distinctive for having distanced himself just a few months ago from Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to deregulate the financial sector, calling it a \u201cmixed bag\u201d and noting that \u201cthere are some ideas that I would not support.\u201dWhile advocating some regulatory relief, particularly for smaller banks, he has voted in favor of every proposal to tighten bank regulations during his tenure on the Fed.Interestingly, like the president\u2019s own deregulatory proposals, all of Mr. Trump\u2019s five semifinalists were not only well qualified but were also far removed from the anti-bank fervor of the populist wing of the Republican Party.In some ways, the choice of Mr. Powell shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. As a highly leveraged real estate developer, Mr. Trump benefited enormously from low interest rates.While the president\u2019s musings on monetary policy have been characteristically inconsistent and even incoherent, he\u2019s mostly sounded like this: \u201cI do like a low interest rate policy, I must be honest with you,\u201d he said in April.For his part, Mr. Powell has happily made clear his lack of affection for Mr. Taylor\u2019s signature contribution to the monetary policy debate, a mathematical rule for setting interest rates that, if applied, would cause rates to be about two percentage points higher today than they are.\u201cI am unable to think of any critical, complex human activity that could be safely reduced to a simple summary equation,\u201d he said at a New York luncheon in February.Even if economic conditions remain quiescent, the Fed will still face challenges, including how quickly to raise interest rates and, as important, how rapidly to reduce its vast holdings of debt securities.For those and other reasons, I would have preferred that Mr. Trump reappoint the current chairman, Janet Yellen.But at least, for once, Mr. Trump has rejected both traditional Republican conservatives as well as his populist base and made a sensible choice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tax Cut That Lifts the Economy? Opinions Are Split", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the release of an ambitious overhaul of the tax code, House Republicans are moving to fulfill a long-held desire of corporate America: a large and audacious tax cut.Yet economists are divided over whether the plan is likely to revitalize the economy or merely bestow a windfall on the wealthiest investors.Even before President Trump vowed as a candidate to sharpen America\u2019s competitive edge, Republicans led by the House speaker, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, were arguing that large tax cuts would unleash a hurricane of economic activity.\u201cWith this plan, we are making pro-growth reforms, so that yes, America can compete with the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Ryan told reporters Thursday on Capitol Hill. \u201cThis is a very important and special moment for our country, for all Americans.\u201dEconomists are still parsing the details, but even some ardent supporters of the plan say expectations about heady growth and job gains are exaggerated. Interest rates are already at bargain-basement levels, plenty of potential investment capital is sloshing around, and the official jobless rate is at lows not seen in many years. Moreover, the cost of the tax package will inevitably deepen the deficit and lead to spending cuts that are likely to hit low- and middle-income workers.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the stimulative benefit on the economy,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. \u201cMost of the benefits as best I can tell will go to wealthy people. The idea that you\u2019re going to get a huge spur to growth is delusional.\u201dSuch dismissiveness failed to deter fans of the twin pillars of the House bill: lowering the top nominal tax rate on corporations to 20 percent from 35 percent, and changing the way global profits are taxed.\u201cThis will make the United States a better place to invest and a better place to be headquartered in,\u201d said Mihir A. Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School who has at times complained about the White House\u2019s economic claims.Under the current system, multinational corporations have been shopping around the globe for countries with low tax rates where they can locate their profits and sometimes their operations. Those global profits are taxed by the United States, but only after they are booked at home. The result is that companies warehouse trillions of dollars offshore, indefinitely postponing the payment of United States taxes.Tax rates don\u2019t single-handedly drive investment decisions, and even now deductions and tax credits often shove the rate paid by corporations far below the 35 percent maximum. Still, many economists argue that matching or undercutting the top rate in other advanced industrialized countries \u2014 particularly in Western Europe \u2014 should encourage investment and productivity.Slashing the rate to 20 percent is \u201ca pretty dramatic change in the attractiveness of the United States relative to other countries,\u201d said Alan Viard, a tax specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.Companies were noncommittal on how the plan might actually change their tax practices \u2014 like those of Corning, the glass and ceramics manufacturer, which had $3.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents outside the country on March 31. \u201cGiven the complexity of our U.S. taxation system,\u201d a spokesman said Thursday, \u201cthe devil will lie in the details of any new legislation.\u201dA shift to taxing domestic and not foreign profits is aimed at discouraging multinationals from moving headquarters, investments and recorded profits abroad. Most other nations have embraced some version of this approach, known as a territorial system.But economists are split on whether that will reduce or worsen global tax avoidance. The bill proposes a global minimum tax of 10 percent to ensure that companies will have to pay something no matter where they have their headquarters. If they pay a lower rate in a foreign country, they would have to remit the difference to the United States. What could bite even harder is a proposal to tack a 20 percent excise tax on transactions between multinationals and their foreign affiliates to deter them from stripping profits out of the United States tax base.No safeguards are foolproof, supporters concede, but they argue that\u2019s the price of admission. \u201cThe reality is, base-erosion rules will always be messy and imperfect,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cIf you want a territorial system, get over it.\u201dYet if the House plan resolves some longstanding issues with the corporate tax code, it also creates new ones. Congress has, in effect, set aside $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to pay for revisions to the tax code, but to keep the cost of the plan to that limit, the Republican leadership is relying on financing gimmicks to phase in some provisions, or put time limits on others.A proposal that allows companies to immediately deduct business expenses rather than stretching them over a number of years potentially has the most impact on smaller companies that need money to build up or expand their business. Indeed a hefty chunk of the administration\u2019s growth estimates is based on the extra investing it is supposed to cause.But the proposal has a five-year time limit. \u201cIf expensing goes away at the end of 2022, they should not expect any permanent growth effect,\u201d said Mr. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute.For businesses, predictability about the tax code is as important as any specific alteration. And temporary measures that obscure the costs deter long-term investment. New low rates and breaks will not be sustainable over the long term if they do not provide enough money to run the government.\u201cIf they want to claim credit for the growth effect,\u201d Mr. Viard said, \u201cthen they have to claim responsibility for the revenue loss.\u201dAll would-be tax reformers juggle varying goals. They want to entice domestic and foreign companies to invest in the United States, which should, in turn, produce more jobs and stockholder returns.They want to create a system that is widely judged as fair.And they need to collect enough revenue to keep the lights on. That includes having the money to cover Social Security payments, antiterrorism measures and disaster relief, as well as maintaining or upgrading the educational, transportation, technological and other systems that undergird the nation\u2019s overall economic strength.Critics worry that the focus on corporate competitiveness gives other goals short shrift.\u201cThe corporate rate cuts are a windfall immediately for stockholders, and not workers,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. And because 35 percent of United States stocks are foreign-owned, he calculated that $70 billion a year of the tax benefits would go to people in other countries.As economists can attest, American competitiveness can be an elusive concept.\u201cBusiness folks won\u2019t describe it like this, but I think the best way to describe what it means to be more competitive is to describe it in terms of increasing the standard of living of the American people,\u201d said Michael J. Graetz, a professor of tax law at Columbia Law School. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t do that, then why do we care?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a calculation made by Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Mr. Rosenthal said that foreign investors who owned United States stocks would receive $70 billion a year in tax benefits, not $70 billion over all.Tiffany Hsu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He earned a law degree from Georgetown University, where he was editor in chief of the Georgetown Law Journal.After working a few years as a lawyer, he embarked in 1984 on a career in investment banking, starting at Dillon, Read and Company in New York.In 1990, during first President George Bush\u2019s term, he moved back to Washington to become the Treasury Department\u2019s under secretary for finance. The Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, had been chairman of Dillon Read. Mr. Powell was responsible for policy on financial institutions and the Treasury debt market.Mr. Powell, a Republican, is a centrist voice in the Fed\u2019s internal debates, often raising his concerns in private conversation rather than in public speeches. He has voted for every policy decision since joining the Fed, including four interest rate increases, and supported the Fed\u2019s decision to unwind the bond-buying program put in place during and after the 2008 financial crisis.In September 2012, when Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman at the time, announced a third round of bond buying as part of that program, Mr. Powell pressed for a clarification of the Fed\u2019s goals, establishing what Mr. Powell called an \u201cofframp\u201d for the program.\u201cIf the economy performs about as expected, I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates,\u201d Mr. Powell said.A survey of 144 investors conducted by Evercore ISI found investors expected that Mr. Powell would push rates modestly higher over time than Ms. Yellen would.\u201cThe whole idea is to preserve the significant core reforms that were made but to go back and clean up our work,\u201d Mr. Powell said.\u201cI see it is a mixed bag,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness.\u201dMr. Powell has shown a willingness to reach across the aisle to seek solutions to problems.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Effort to Tame Its Financial System May Disappoint", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the details may raise more questions than they answer, and could disappoint those looking for a strong hand to rein in the financial system underpinning the world\u2019s second-largest economy.Official Chinese media reported late Wednesday that a new Financial Stability and Development Committee had held its first meeting, nearly four months after President Xi Jinping ordered its creation. It said the meeting was led by Ma Kai, a 71-year-old vice premier.At the meeting, Mr. Ma stressed that China\u2019s financial system should serve the real economy, according to the official Xinhua news agency \u2014 namely, making money available to businesses that need it. He also stressed financial security, the report said.But the commission that emerged seemed more a minnow than a whale. None of the current agencies disappeared, and the commission was merely assigned a small office in a corner of the central bank.Mr. Ma himself is something of a lame duck, being past the age when Chinese officials typically retire. While he remains a vice premier in the Chinese government, he lost his seats on senior decision-making bodies within the Chinese Communist Party amid a broad reshuffle last month.Still, the committee could be strengthened later, or more details may emerge that further outline its powers.The decision to hold the committee as President Trump arrived in Beijing for a meeting with Mr. Xi may be an indication that the Chinese leadership is still focused on the country\u2019s financial vulnerabilities, even if a long-term leader to address those vulnerabilities has not yet been chosen.Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the country\u2019s central bank for the past 15 years, and who is also expected to retire this winter, has been issuing increasingly dire warnings in recent weeks about the country\u2019s mountain of debt, particularly at state-owned enterprises and local governments.\u201cIn recent years, nonperforming loans have risen, eroding banking capital and risk resilience,\u201d Mr. Zhou warned in a statement released Saturday. The statement went on to warn about rising bond defaults as well as Ponzi schemes masquerading as internet finance companies.Having a vice premier run the first meeting nonetheless raises the profile of the commission. It could establish a precedent that the commission may continue to be run by a vice premier. Vice premiers are at least two rungs more senior in the Chinese system than the minister-level officials who run the central bank and the financial regulatory agencies.Its next leader might also be considerably more influential and politically connected. Some experts suggest that Liu He, a close economic adviser to Mr. Xi, may emerge as the successor to Mr. Ma as the vice premier with responsibility over wide areas of the economy, including financial regulation.Mr. Liu has a reputation for advocating a greater reliance on market forces in economic reform policies.

Whether we get covered through an employer or the Affordable Care Act exchanges, we\u2019ll be told to carefully review our options to find a plan that will give us the best coverage for the least amount of money.We will be told we need to shop.Make it stop!This is not shopping. Shopping is a fun activity, like choosing a pie from the bakery or picking out cereal at the supermarket. The farthest thing from \u201cshopping\u201d is the arduous annual ritual of reviewing the complex and all but impossible to decipher health insurance options.Plus, we have choices when we do the real kind of shopping. If we don\u2019t like the luggage in one store, we can always head to another. But if we don\u2019t like the health insurance options our employer selects, or the options on the local exchange \u2014 well, short of changing jobs or moving, we\u2019re stuck. That\u2019s hardly the definition of consumer empowerment.Isn\u2019t it absurd to describe us as shoppers? When I go shopping at the mall, I get perfume samples and free chocolates. When I consider health insurance plans, I am offered no such things.Moreover, 326 million Americans cannot combat our high-cost medical system with one savvy purchase. The term prioritizes the values of the marketplace and financial world. It also signals that instead of contemplating how to make the medical-industrial complex work for us, our energy is channeled into getting the best deal we can from a system that\u2019s designed not for our benefit, but to extract the greatest amount of profit from every patient.Health care is much more than a mere consumer item, even if we do spend money to get it. It\u2019s fundamental to our lives. So hear me out. Whether you are a reporter on deadline, an insurance official discussing plans or someone reviewing your options, just say people should \u201cchoose\u201d or \u201cpick\u201d a plan. But whatever you do, don\u2019t conflate the pleasurable experience of real shopping with the dreary task of finding a health insurance plan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Attack Turns Focus to Central Asian Militancy", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince the fall of the Soviet Union, Islamist insurgencies have erupted throughout the region, most notably in the Caucasus and the suspect\u2019s native Uzbekistan. While those insurgencies have been mostly suppressed, often with unflinching brutality, analysts have grown increasingly concerned about Islamist radicalism spreading out of the region as young men leave in search of work.This is particularly true, analysts say, of Uzbekistan, where a blend of repressive politics and economic failure has generated a steady outflow of both migrants and militants. Many of the immigrants have come to the United States \u2014 nearly 60,000 as of 2013, the American Community Survey said, with about half of them going to New York City.The expanse of desert and mountains north of Afghanistan has a total population of about 60 million. Uzbekistan, with around 32 million people, is by far the most populous, and has a long history with Islamist militancy.A spiral of repression and radicalization that has spawned three major Islamist groups began soon after the Soviet breakup, as an Islamic revival filled the vacuum left by Communism.Proselytizing by Saudi-financed groups advocated a particularly austere form of Islam, and a renewed interest in Islam in much of the former Soviet space, sped things along.\u201cOf course, when one ideology falls, another one takes over,\u201d Shahida Tulaganova, a former producer with BBC from Uzbekistan, and a close observer of Islamist movements in the region, said in a telephone interview.Not surprisingly, underground religious groups formed. Members of the most prominent organization, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, were driven out of the country in the late 1990s and were active in Afghanistan and Pakistan for years, though many of its members have now joined the Islamic State\u2019s organization in Afghanistan.The crackdown and mass arrests that swept the country were so alarming that the United States was prompted to close an air base in Uzbekistan that had supported operations in Afghanistan. The Uzbek government announced in 2016 that Mr. Yuldashev had died in prison five years earlier, from tuberculosis.Akramia was not clearly militant in nature, so its dismantling drove home the message that Uzbeks drawn to religion not sanctioned by the state would have to leave the country.\u201cThe propaganda on YouTube is amazing,\u201d said Ms. Tulaganova, the former television producer. \u201cI wonder why nobody takes it down.\u201dThe Islamic State\u2019s success in recruiting Central Asian migrants outside their home countries has already drawn the attention of researchers. The International Crisis Group, for example, has examined recruitment among Uzbek and Kyrgyz migrant laborers since 2014, and is preparing a report on the issue.\u201cWhat is a really critical factor, and what sets the Islamic State apart from others like the Taliban, is its ability to disseminate propaganda in Russian and Central Asian languages,\u201d Deirdre Tynan, the Central Asia project director for the International Crisis Group, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd it is available whether you are watching as an Uzbek migrant in Russia or on the East Coast of the United States.\u201d\u201cYoung men who left Uzbekistan find themselves isolated, perhaps not as successful as they wanted to be, or maybe just lonely,\u201d she said. In Syria, the Islamic State\u2019s Central Asian recruits are often given menial jobs or used as cannon fodder. She said a disproportionate number of suicide bombers in Iraq and Syria were Tajiks.Daniil Kislov, the Moscow-based editor of Ferghana, a website that tracks developments in Central Asia, said that Uzbek labor migrants in Russia, and possibly other countries too, had long been of keen interest to recruiters. He cautioned that Mr. Saipov had lived for many years in the West and might have become radicalized during that time.But as many analysts have warned, growing up under a suffocatingly repressive government, particularly in its treatment of Muslims, is the sort of searing experience that could make a young man like him receptive to the militants\u2019 lure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Norway\u2019s Wealth Fund Considers Divesting From Oil Shares", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNorway\u2019s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund is considering a divestment of holdings in international petroleum companies, a sign that even Europe\u2019s dominant producer does not have full confidence in oil\u2019s future.The recommendation on Thursday by the Norwegian Central Bank, which manages the fund, is potentially the biggest advance yet for a global fossil-fuel divestment campaign that has been promoted on college campuses and by environmental activists.It could also be a setback for the proposed initial public offering of the Saudi national oil company, known as Aramco, since the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, the world\u2019s largest, would be a potentially large investor. The public offering depends on high oil prices, while the move by the Norwegian bank suggested uncertainty about the future demand for oil.\u201cIt\u2019s very significant symbolically because it sends a signal that even the people who make money from oil and gas are coming up with divestment plans,\u201d said Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cThe Norwegian view is that oil has had a good run and will have a good run for a couple of decades but it\u2019s not the only future that is out there.\u201dWith roughly $35 billion invested in oil companies, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is a large investor in Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, Chevron and Norway\u2019s own oil giant, Statoil. Statoil has begun to diversify its holdings by building large offshore wind-energy projects.Although it is Europe\u2019s top oil producer, Norway is also a leader in the movement to control climate change. With hefty incentives, roughly 40 percent of cars bought in Norway last year were electric, and the government plans to phase out diesel- and gasoline-fueled cars in the next decade.The potential Norwegian divestment of oil is not expected to happen until late 2018 at the soonest.But on a day when oil prices were down moderately and most global stock markets soared, shares of several large oil companies were down by up to 1 percent.\u201cIt sends a signal that others could follow, and if this becomes a growing movement it could have a material impact,\u201d said Brian M. Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones Investments. \u201cIt shows the global environmental movement continues to gain steam.\u201dEnvironmentalists praised the potential divestment as historically important.\u201cWith Norway\u2019s move, the campaign to divest from dirty fuels will graduate from environmental groups and small businesses like Ben & Jerry\u2019s and colleges to the big time,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, based in Washington. \u201cNorway\u2019s move will fuel divestment even more because Norway is a major oil country.\u201dReligious institutions, pension funds and other financial institutions in more than 70 countries controlling more than $5 trillion in assets have already committed to dropping some of their fossil-fuel holdings in recent years. The movement gained a major push from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Another movement by investors has pressured European and American oil companies to disclose how climate change and future carbon taxes might affect the sustainability of their reserves, arguing that there is a risk to investors that many resources will need to be left in the ground.The future of oil will also be dependent on demand and prices. There is a hot debate among analysts about exactly when demand for oil will peak. Some note that with the economies of China and other developing countries growing, there are decades more of growth for oil. BP has projected that the global auto fleet will double by 2035 to 1.8 billion vehicles.But others say the electric cars and more efficient internal combustion engines will dominate transportation in the future, and deeply depress demand in gasoline and diesel. Several major car companies are investing in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, and Exxon Mobil is investing in advanced biofuels.Royal Dutch Shell has projected that gasoline demand is likely to peak by the 2030s. Chevron\u2019s departing chief executive, John Watson, recently said he was confident of demand growth for oil over the next decade or two.\u201cThere is no sign of peak demand right now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mayor Sought Money, a Donor Sought Access: Both Said \u2018Yes\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen it came to making political donations for Mayor Bill de Blasio, Jona S. Rechnitz liked to think of himself as a yes man, always quick with the pen. For his generosity, Mr. Rechnitz was provided access to City Hall: The mayor took his calls, problems with agencies were addressed, questions got answered.Yet as the mayor neared the end of his first year in office, Mr. Rechnitz grew restless. He felt he was no longer getting his money\u2019s worth.Not long after, Mr. de Blasio called Mr. Rechnitz with his biggest ask yet: a six-figure donation to help Democrats win the State Senate. Mr. Rechnitz said he could not turn down the mayor and wrote a check for $102,300.Suddenly the gears of government began spinning again for Mr. Rechnitz, a real estate investor. A city official emailed him with an offer to set up a meeting to discuss hefty fines that Mr. Rechnitz claimed were levied unfairly against a Manhattan building that he owned. About the same time, city officials began answering his long-stalled questions about another property in Brooklyn.Mr. Rechnitz, once among the mayor\u2019s biggest donors, is the key government witness in a corruption trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan against a powerful former correction union boss, Norman Seabrook. Mr. Rechnitz, who has already pleaded guilty to crimes involving bribery, has been testifying against Mr. Seabrook.But in his days on the stand, beginning last week, he delivered his characterization of Mr. de Blasio as a politician ready and willing to swing wide the doors of City Hall to an obscure young real estate investor \u2014 as long as Mr. Rechnitz kept the donations coming.His testimony, corroborated in many parts by a series of emails provided by the city in response to a Freedom of Information law request, describe a City Hall where donors had top-level access. They show the mayor asking Mr. Rechnitz for ever greater sums of money; he received access and the cachet that came with it. And Mr. Rechnitz kept opening his wallet, leveraging the access his largess bought him to schmooze business associates and pose as a big shot.Mr. de Blasio, whose fund-raising practices were once the subject of federal and state investigations, is not a defendant in the trial. But Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s testimony has given New Yorkers a glimpse of what prosecutors had as potential evidence, as they ultimately decided to not bring charges against the mayor.Mr. Rechnitz cooperated with the federal investigation and with a separate probe by the Manhattan district attorney, agreeing to plead guilty to honest services wire fraud, admitting, according to his court testimony, to \u201cgiving money to the mayor of New York in exchange for favors\u201d and to a scheme to bribe Mr. Seabrook.The son of a wealthy California family, Mr. Rechnitz, 34, attended college in New York and then stayed, eventually starting a real estate business. Along the way he met Jeremy Reichberg, a Brooklyn man who had connections in the Police Department.Over time, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg befriended Mr. Seabrook and top police officials, including Philip Banks III, once the highest-ranking uniformed member of the department. He lavished gifts on the police officials and Mr. Seabrook and took them on trips. In exchange, he got favors, such as police escorts.In 2013, Mr. Rechnitz turned his sights on City Hall. \u201cWe had the police going for us and now it was time to get into politics,\u201d he testified.After Mr. de Blasio won the Democratic mayoral primary that September, Mr. Rechnitz said that he and Mr. Reichberg met with Ross Offinger, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s chief fund-raiser, and delivered a message. \u201cWe\u2019re going to become significant contributors, but we want access,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said he told Mr. Offinger. \u201cWhen we reach out for things, we want them to get done.\u201dHe said Mr. Offinger asked how much Mr. Rechnitz and his associates could raise. Mr. Rechnitz said he offered to raise up to $100,000.He said Mr. de Blasio soon paid him a visit in his Midtown office and the politician gave him his personal cellphone number and email address and \u201ctold me to call if there\u2019s anything I need, always be in touch, and he really appreciated my support and friendship.\u201dMr. Rechnitz said he called the mayor often during the campaign and afterward. But Mr. de Blasio has said that they were never close.Mr. de Blasio said during the debate that he gave his personal email to \u201cthousands\u201d of people, but he refused to make public cellphone records that could show how often the men were in contact. He has also repeatedly said he cannot remember key elements of his dealings with Mr. Rechnitz.Mr. Rechnitz named several instances in which he sought help, including for a friend who wanted assistance with hefty charges on water bills. The emails show that Mr. Reichberg raised the issue of $650,000 of \u201covercharges\u201d with the chief of staff of First Deputy Mayor Tony Shorris. The charges were ultimately reduced. Mr. de Blasio has said that they were excessive because of a faulty meter and that the problem was addressed as it would be \u201cfor any taxpayer.\u201dBut Mr. Rechnitz said that some concerns were not getting proper attention. One involved a building he owned on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, which city inspectors said was being used illegally as a hotel, through Airbnb rentals; another involved the Brooklyn property, where he said that a sale had been held up because the Police Department saw it as a potential site for a precinct station house.That was when Mr. Offinger contacted Mr. Rechnitz to ask for money to help Democrats take over the State Senate \u2014 a priority of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s.\u201cI told him no,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said, adding: \u201cI said, \u2018You know, I have not even heard from the mayor in a while. All you do is you come here when you need money.\u2019\u201dMr. Rechnitz said that after the rebuff, Mr. de Blasio called him, although the mayor has said that he cannot remember if he personally asked Mr. Rechnitz for the donation. \u201cThe mayor told me that it would mean a great deal to him,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said. He said he could not turn down a personal appeal from the mayor. \u201cI asked him, \u2018What\u2019s the maximum I\u2019m allowed to donate to you, Mr. Mayor?\u2019 He said: \u2018You can talk to Ross. I think it\u2019s $102,000.\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201dMr. Rechnitz wrote a check to the New York State Senate Democratic Campaign Committee from one of his companies, JSTD Madison, on Oct. 22, 2014, according to campaign finance records.On Oct. 29, Mr. Rechnitz received an email from an official at what was then known as the Mayor\u2019s Office of Criminal Justice, which was responsible for enforcing violations like those at his Madison Avenue building, offering to schedule a meeting.The head of the office, Elan Parra, later sent Mr. Rechnitz an email asking to meet with him \u201cso that we can discuss some of the issues/concerns you raised.\u201d A meeting was eventually scheduled in December.Besides the State Senate donation, Mr. Rechnitz and his wife, Rachel, each made the maximum contribution of $4,950 to Mr. de Blasio in 2013. Mr. Rechnitz also contributed $50,000 to a nonprofit group created by Mr. de Blasio and bundled $41,650 in donations from other people to the mayor, although he admitted during the trial that a portion of that was his own money, funneled to the mayor through straw donors.Mr. de Blasio has said that Mr. Rechnitz did not get his fines on the Madison Avenue building reduced and did not receive special treatment. He said he treated all constituents the same.The testimony is not likely to alter the course of the 2017 election, with the vote on Tuesday. But it provided fodder for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s opponents during the Wednesday debate.\u201cWhen I saw him testify, I wanted to take a shower,\u201d said Bo Dietl, an independent candidate for mayor, describing Mr. Rechnitz. \u201cThis guy is a creep, he\u2019s disgusting, and this mayor dealt with him.\u201dVivian Wang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Puerto Rico, Law Passed for Fiscal Crisis Hampers Storm Recovery", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Puerto Rico faced a fiscal crisis last year after racking up $123 billion in debt and pension liabilities, Congress passed special legislation to give it relief from creditors and time to find its financial footing.Now, with Washington\u2019s help needed perhaps more urgently, a key piece of that legislation is hampering efforts to address the lingering effects of Hurricane Maria \u2014 and possibly threatening Puerto Rico\u2019s broader economic comeback as well.Two contentious events this week \u2014 a court ruling and a day of hearings on Capitol Hill \u2014 have brought the fundamental challenge into sharp focus: Even in an emergency, federal officials have limited say over how Puerto Rico conducts its affairs.\u201cIt would be more efficient if we could just say, \u2018These people aren\u2019t doing their job,\u2019 and replace them,\u201d said James E. Spiotto, a managing director at Chapman Strategic Advisors, a municipal finance consulting firm, referring to recovery efforts on the island that remain halting nearly two months after the storm hit. \u201cBut we are a democracy, not an oligarchy.\u201dThe special legislation, known as Promesa, placed Puerto Rico under the oversight of a federal board and subjected its debt to a court-supervised restructuring. The law patched together provisions reflecting the island\u2019s status as a self-governing United States territory and parts of Chapter 9, the federal bankruptcy code covering local governments.Among other things, Chapter 9 greatly limits the authority that bankruptcy court judges and other federal officials can exert over insolvent local governments. Despite that aspect of Chapter 9, which prevents the imposition of tax increases or pension freezes in bankruptcies involving cities like Detroit and Stockton, Calif., Congress chose to incorporate it into Promesa.The implications of that move are becoming clearer as relief efforts in Puerto Rico sputter along compared with the smoother federal responses this year to hurricanes in Florida and Texas.Last month, it emerged that the island\u2019s public utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or Prepa, had given a small Montana company a $300 million contract under questionable circumstances to get the island\u2019s electric grid up and running. The awarding of that contract is now under investigation.Amid the resulting outcry, the oversight board asked the judge overseeing the restructuring case to appoint a new leader for the authority, which itself is insolvent. The board framed its proposal in dry legal terms, steering clear of any hint that Prepa\u2019s existing leadership might be incompetent.Others were less diplomatic. A group of Prepa bondholders filed its own motion with the court, saying that although the power was still out across large parts of Puerto Rico, it was not because Prepa\u2019s infrastructure had been destroyed.The bondholders had hired their own engineering team, which said it found that while plenty of wires were down, the island\u2019s power plants were unscathed. Beyond that, the team\u2019s leader, Derek HasBrouck said, almost all of the authority\u2019s transmission towers were intact, as were utility poles in San Juan and many substations. He blamed \u201cthe egregious mishandling of the restoration process on Prepa\u2019s part\u201d for the continuing blackouts.\u201cThe oversight board is right to conclude that fundamental changes, including senior leadership changes, are required at Prepa,\u201d Mr. HasBrouck wrote in a filing. The bondholders called for the appointment of a receiver, rather than the \u201cchief transformation officer\u201d sought by the oversight board.But on Monday, after hearing arguments, Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled that under Promesa, the oversight board had no legal authority to install new leadership at the power company. Only Puerto Rico\u2019s government, she said, has that power.Judge Swain also said the board had no authority to impose austerity measures on Puerto Rico, even if it thought steps taken by Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 did not go far enough. The board had tried to impose such measures earlier this year, but set that aside after the damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria forced the island\u2019s government to redo its entire fiscal plan.Mr. Spiotto said he thought Judge Swain had interpreted the oversight board\u2019s authority correctly. But Congress can still tie some strings to whatever portion of the requested aid it authorizes, he added.On Tuesday, appearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Natalie Jaresko, the oversight board\u2019s executive director, called Judge Swain\u2019s decision \u201ca setback for us\u201d that she said would make the restoration of electrical power much more difficult. And getting the electrical grid back in shape, she said, is \u201cthe single most important block of the recovery, short and long term.\u201dUntil that happens, she said, Puerto Rico will not have a functioning water system, public schools cannot open and businesses shut since the Hurricane Maria will stay that way. Puerto Ricans, she added, would continue to head to the mainland for a semblance of normal life.\u201cWe are not yet throwing up our hands,\u201d Ms. Jaresko said.By contrast, Mr. Rossell\u00f3, who also testified before congressional committees on Tuesday, appeared emboldened by Judge Swain\u2019s ruling. Just last week, many Puerto Rico residents were blaming the governor for failing to get the lights back on and for awarding the contract to the Montana company, Whitefish Energy Holdings.But after the ruling on Monday, he defiantly told lawmakers that the oversight board had authority in just three areas: representing Puerto Rico in the restructuring proceedings, ensuring that its budget is balanced and helping the island regain its ability to tap the public credit markets.Mr. Rossell\u00f3 is seeking up to $95 billion to repair the hurricane damage, and he forcefully countered those who suggested that the oversight board ought to be tracking the money and making sure it was spent appropriately.Representative Jody B. Hice, Republican of Georgia, insisted that the board had \u201cto have administrative control over the money.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Mr. Rossell\u00f3 asked, adding that it was \u201cnot their role.\u201dRepresentative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, urged Mr. Rossell\u00f3 to stop clashing with the oversight board.\u201cYou\u2019re asking for a huge amount of money,\u201d Mr. Bishop said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be an increase in cooperation.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be at the expense of democratic rights, sir,\u201d Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said.Advertisement"}

But similar strategies will be used as long as we let companies choose the location of their profits.A potential fix would be to allocate the taxable profits made by multinationals proportionally to the amount of sales they make in each country.Such a reform would quash artificial profit-shifting. Corporations may be able to shift around profits, assets, and subsidiaries, but they cannot move all their customers to Bermuda.One advantage of allocating taxable profits as I suggest is that this reform can be adopted unilaterally. There is no need for the United States (or any other nation that wants to cut down on tax avoidance) to obtain permission from anybody.But we\u2019d still face an equally daunting problem, the far more shadowy \u2013 and ultimately illegal \u2013 tax evasion of ultrawealthy individuals, many of them with net worths already bolstered by the proceeds of corporate tax avoidance. Here\u2019s an example.Meet Michael. Michael is the (fictional) chief executive and owner of an American company, Michael & Company. Like many people, he would like to pay as little in taxes as possible. But unlike most people, he can take some steps that will allow him to do just that.Michael & Co.AmericaAnonymous Shell Co. Inc.Cayman IslandsMichael & Co.AmericaAnonymous Shell Co. Inc.BankCyprusCayman IslandsMichael & Co.AmericaAnonymous Shell Co. Inc.BankCyprusCayman IslandsMichael & Co.AmericaAnonymous Shell Co. Inc.BankCyprusCayman IslandsThe transaction generates a paper trail that can appear legitimate at first glance. But the reality is more insidious. By paying for fictitious consulting, Michael fraudulently reduces the taxable profits of Michael & Company, and thus the amount of corporate income tax he pays.And once the money has arrived in Cyprus, it is invested in global financial markets and generates income that the Internal Revenue Service can tax only if Michael reports it or if his  Cypriot bank informs the I.R.S.And meanwhile, in America, if he wants to use any of the money stashed in Cyprus, he can simply go to an ATM and make a withdrawal from his offshore account.We can stop offshore tax evasion by shining some light on darker corners of the global banking industry. The most compelling way to do this would be to create comprehensive registries recording the true individual owners of real estate and financial securities, including equities, bonds and mutual fund shares.One common objection to financial registries is that they would impinge on privacy. Yet countries have maintained property records for land and real estate for decades. These records are public, and epidemics of abuse are hard to come by.The notion that a register of financial wealth would be a radical departure is wrong. And the benefits would be enormous, as comprehensive registries would make it possible to not only reduce tax evasion, but also curb money laundering, monitor international capital flows, fight the financing of terrorism and better measure inequality.The onus here is on the United States and the European Union. Why do we allow criminals, tax evaders and kleptocrats to ultimately use our financial and real estate markets to launder their wealth? Transparency is the first step in making sure the wealthy can\u2019t cheat their way out of contributing to the common good.Produced by Jessia Ma and Taylor AdamsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Save the SALT Deduction", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDo congressional Republicans and President Trump want to undertake a multitrillion-dollar federal bailout of states and cities? If not, the Senate and House should squelch their competing proposals to reduce or eliminate Americans\u2019 ability to deduct state and local taxes on their federal tax forms.Curtailing tax breaks is generally a good idea. Subsidies for certain activities distort the economy. When the mortgage-interest deduction spurs a family to buy a more expensive home than they would have otherwise, it keeps that money from more productive parts of the economy.But state and local tax deductions do not fall into this category. Since the nation\u2019s founding, American citizens have safeguarded small-scale democracy. The Bill of Rights prescribes that \u201cthe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states.\u201dScholars and judges differ over where state control ends and federal oversight starts. But no scholar argues that states, cities and towns don\u2019t possess the right and obligation to staff schools, pave roads, purify water and put out fires.For this, local and state governments need money \u2014 which they mostly get from their own taxpayers, not from Washington. To assert that the federal government has the primary claim on this tax dollar, as Republicans are doing, is to claim that the federal government bears the primary responsibility for these tasks.That\u2019s not a conservative argument, but a European one. In France, the national government, not Paris, stands behind a $37 billion \u201cGrand Paris\u201d plan to improve public transportation. In America, by contrast, Washington expects New York and New Jersey to bear half the cost of a new tunnel under the Hudson River, even though Amtrak, the national railroad, depends on this critical piece of infrastructure. Similarly, New York has received only $1.3 billion toward the $4.2 billion cost of the first three stops of the Second Avenue subway. The rest comes from New York taxpayers.Wealthier taxpayers do disproportionately benefit from these tax deductions, because they pay the most in taxes. In New York City, just 1 percent of tax filers \u2014 37,273 households \u2014 pay 49.3 percent of city income taxes. But their ability to deduct these taxes from federal taxable income is an indirect subsidy to New York\u2019s poorer and middle-class residents, who benefit from state and local spending on education, Medicaid, public safety and homeless services.If Congress were going to diminish America\u2019s local-governance model anyway, now is not the time. Nearly a decade into the economic recovery, state and local governments remain under fiscal stress, particularly when it comes to pension and health care promises to retirees.Chicago owes $45.2 billion to current and future public-sector pensioners, but had set aside only $9.5 billion as of the city\u2019s latest audited annual report. New Jersey and its local governments owe $122.2 billion, but have set aside just $53.7 billion. Even healthier governments, such as New York State and New York City, owe tens of billions of dollars in future health care payment obligations to retirees.As retirement costs have grown, state and local governments have cut back on infrastructure investments. Municipal debt \u2014 the mechanism through which governments borrow to build and maintain infrastructure \u2014 is 17 percent below its 2007 level after inflation.Republicans characterize this issue as a blue-state problem because blue states have higher taxes. But red states are struggling too. Texas owes $39.1 billion for pensions, but has set aside just $25 billion. Gulf states, including Florida and Louisiana, must invest in flood-protection measures. Houston voters approved new borrowing for such infrastructure this month \u2014 borrowing enabled by local tax deductions.Republicans also characterize the issue as one of local mismanagement. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to the federal government to save New York from its bad decisions,\u201d said Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, last week. True, governments from Chicago to New Jersey have made poor fiscal decisions. In a system that grants citizens great autonomy to govern themselves at the local level, disparities in financial management are inevitable. But it is none of Washington\u2019s business that New York\u2019s taxes are too high.One reality remains \u2014 somebody must pay. Three sources exist: taxpayers; public-sector retirees, via pension and health-benefits cuts; and municipal investors, via Detroit-style debt defaults in severe cases. Congress is making the first more difficult for state and local governments, and in most places, legal protections prevent governments from cutting pension benefits.That leaves bondholders. As the Standard & Poor\u2019s rating agency said this week, the overall impact of a tax plan that curtails state and local tax deductions \u201ccould be costly and detrimental to the credit quality of many public-finance issuers.\u201dSigning a bill into law that creates systemic distress for a financial market that affects the lives of all Americans is hardly the best way to improve the economy. And it may result in eventual tax increases, not tax cuts, at the federal level. Global investors may grow tired of America\u2019s lurching from crisis to crisis and raise the cost of federal borrowing, as well.Nicole Gelinas is a contributing editor to the Manhattan Institute\u2019s City Journal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Hung Jury in Seabrook Case, a Troubled Witness Looms Over Retrial", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver six days on the witness stand, Mr. Rechnitz said he facilitated a kickback scheme between Mr. Seabrook and Murray Huberfeld, a financier, who was also on trial. Mr. Rechnitz said he paid Mr. Seabrook $60,000 in return for Mr. Seabrook steering $20 million of union money into Mr. Huberfeld\u2019s hedge fund.But defense lawyers seized upon inconsistencies and unsavory details in Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s testimony to discredit his narrative.They emphasized that Mr. Rechnitz had admitted lying to family, friends and law enforcement, and they pointed to Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s account of trying to buy influence with key city officials, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, as evidence of his history of self-interest. They said Mr. Rechnitz was framing Mr. Seabrook to win leniency at his own sentencing for fraud conspiracy.That argument seemed to have gained a foothold in jurors\u2019 minds.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t remember half the things he said the week before,\u201d Joseph Roldan, a juror, said of Mr. Rechnitz in an interview after court. Mr. Rechnitz had appeared to be \u201cin it for himself.\u201dThe judge, Andrew L. Carter Jr. of Federal District Court in Manhattan, declared the mistrial on the sixth day of deliberations, after jurors sent a note telling him they could not reach an agreement, their second such note in three days. After the first note, on Tuesday, Judge Carter directed them to continue deliberating.The second note, which arrived around 2 p.m. on Thursday, said the jurors saw \u201cno prospect of making further progress,\u201d despite \u201ccontinued, spirited discussion and contemplation of the evidence.\u201dDefense lawyers moved for a mistrial; prosecutors did not object.Mr. Seabrook and Mr. Huberfeld, both 57, were each charged with one count of honest services wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. Mr. Roldan said the jury had been leaning toward a split verdict, with a majority voting to find the defendants not guilty on the first count and guilty on the second. Eventually, they deadlocked with 10 jurors voting to find the defendants guilty on the conspiracy charge and two voting to acquit, and 11 jurors voting not guilty on the fraud charge and one voting to convict, he said.Mr. Seabrook\u2019s lawyer, Paul Shechtman, was clear on what he said had caused the mistrial.\u201cJona Rechnitz was the weakness in this case from the get-go,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they retry it, he\u2019ll be the weakness in this case.\u201dBut Mr. Roldan, a chef who lives in the Bronx, was more measured when asked if Mr. Rechnitz was the reason for the jurors\u2019 split.\u201cIt was a tough decision,\u201d he said, adding that he had initially voted to acquit on both charges, but he was persuaded to change his vote on the conspiracy charge.He also figured prominently in federal and state investigations into the mayor\u2019s fund-raising practices, although prosecutors eventually decided not to bring charges.A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio declined to comment on the mistrial.Mr. Seabrook thanked each juror as each filed out of the courtroom. But his remarks to the news media were more subdued than they had been on Tuesday when the jury first reported it was at an impasse. At the time, he had declared the deadlock proof of his innocence.\u201cWould I have preferred a not guilty? Absolutely,\u201d he said in an interview outside the courthouse on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate at this time. But I will continue to fight for my innocence, because I am innocent.\u201dMr. Seabrook dismissed the move as illegal.\u201cI am the president of the Correction Officers\u2019 Benevolent Association,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cWhen I return, I will return to my post.\u201dBut Joon H. Kim, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, indicated that he has no intention of allowing that return.\u201cWe look forward to a retrial where we will present again the powerful proof of how Seabrook allegedly sold his duty to safeguard correction officers\u2019 retirement money to Murray Huberfeld in exchange for cash bribes,\u201d Mr. Kim said in a statement. \u201cAlthough justice has been delayed, we expect it will ultimately prevail.\u201dSean Piccoli contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Asia, Mr. Trump Is Met by Doubt", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAs President Trump undertakes his first official trip to Asia, American leadership and credibility are in doubt. Leaders in the region worry that his inflammatory statements and impulsiveness could lead to war with North Korea. And there is a serious debate in many Asian countries about whether the future lies in closer partnerships with China, the ascendant power, or with the United States.With so much on the line, one would hope that Mr. Trump has prepared carefully for the challenge. Given what we\u2019ve seen from him, there is good reason to question whether he has.Mr. Trump arrives in Asia as a wounded leader, with low ratings at home and a stalled legislative agenda, and dogged by revelations of Russian interference in the 2016 election on his behalf that have led to indictments against former advisers. His furious denunciations of the constitutional constraints he faces in trying to scuttle the investigation bring to mind the authoritarian leaders of whom he is so fond. This, along with his disregard for human rights, further diminishes the democracy that is America\u2019s greatest source of strength and influence in the region.To address these doubts, Mr. Trump is expected to use a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam to call for a \u201cfree and open\u201d Indo-Pacific region, with the goal of containing China, where Mr. Trump will have a state visit with President Xi Jinping. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has raised the possibility of countering Mr. Xi\u2019s $1 trillion \u201cone belt, one road\u201d initiative of roads, pipelines and other projects linking China to Europe and Asia with \u201calternative financing measures, financing structures.\u201d But where the money might come from is a major question.Mr. Trump has already undercut his two main priorities for the trip. He wants China to exert more pressure on North Korea to end the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program by completely cutting off purchases of North Korean coal, closing North Korean bank accounts and sending North Korean workers home. Mr. Xi has repeatedly rejected going as far as Mr. Trump demands, because doing so could destabilize North Korea, and he has pushed for a negotiated solution to the crisis. But Mr. Trump, reversing his own secretary of state, has refused talks, preferring bombastic threats to \u201cdestroy\u201d North Korea that will be magnified if he repeats them in Asia.Mr. Trump, pressing a campaign theme, is also pushing hard for China to open up markets and end state subsidies so there is \u201cfair and reciprocal\u201d treatment of the United States. Instead of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership that he rejected, he favors bilateral deals. But his administration is divided over trade policy, and the most he may get out of the Beijing visit is some commercial agreements between Chinese and American companies.Advertisement"}

She was 90.Her death was confirmed by a family spokesman, Jeffrey Stewart.Much of the family\u2019s holdings have been in trusts named for Mrs. Tisch and for Laurence\u2019s widow, Wilma Tisch.Joan Tisch\u2019s son Jonathan is co-chairman of the company, treasurer of the Giants and chief executive of Loews hotels.

Mrs. Tisch paid the company about $75,000 a month for her apartment, according to its proxy statement.While Mrs. Tisch was often referred to as a socialite, she was also a fervent benefactor for causes like the AIDS crisis.\u201cI\u2019m Joan and I\u2019d like to volunteer,\u201d she announced when she showed up in the mid-1980s at the tiny office of the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis after several of her friends had contracted AIDS. Without identifying herself further, she went to work stuffing envelopes and working the switchboard.\u201cFor the first time in years of volunteering, I had become emotionally involved,\u201d she was quoted as saying in \u201cFighting for Our Lives: New York\u2019s AIDS Community and the Politics of Disease,\u201d by Susan Maizel Chambre (2006). \u201cI witnessed the signifying of wills of men younger than my children.

{"Headline": "Capitalism Has a Problem. Is Free Money the Answer?", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 One need not be a card-carrying revolutionary to deduce that global capitalism has a problem.Enter the universal basic income.The idea is gaining traction in many countries as a proposal to soften the edges of capitalism. Though the details and philosophies vary from place to place, the general notion is that the government hands out regular checks to everyone, regardless of income or whether people are working. The money ensures food and shelter for all, while removing the stigma of public support.Some posit basic income as a way to let market forces work their ruthless magic, delivering innovation and economic growth, while laying down a cushion for those who fail. Others present it as a means of liberating people from wretched, poverty-level jobs, allowing workers to organize for better conditions or devote time to artistic exploits. Another school sees it as the required response to an era in which work can no longer be relied upon to finance basic needs.\u201cWe see the increasing precariousness of employment,\u201d said Karl Widerquist, a philosopher at Georgetown University in Qatar, and a prominent advocate for a universal social safety net. \u201cBasic income gives the worker the power to say, \u2018Well, if Walmart\u2019s not going to pay me enough, then I\u2019m just not going to work there.\u2019 \u201dThe Canadian province of Ontario is enrolling participants for a basic income trial. Several cities in the Netherlands are exploring what happens when they hand out cash grants unconditionally to people already receiving some form of public support. A similar test is underway in Barcelona, Spain.As a concept, basic income has been kicked around in various guises for centuries, gaining adherents across a strikingly broad swath of the ideological spectrum, from the English social philosopher Thomas More to the American revolutionary Thomas Paine.The populist firebrand Louisiana governor Huey Long, the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., and the laissez faire economist Milton Friedman would presumably agree on little, yet all advocated some version of basic income.Not everyone loves the idea. Conservatives fret that handing out money free of obligation will turn people into dole-dependent slackers.In the American context, any talk of a truly universal form of basic income also collides with arithmetic. Give every American $10,000 a year \u2014 a sum still below the poverty line for an individual \u2014 and the tab runs to $3 trillion a year. That is about eight times what the United States now spends on social service programs. Conversation over.Labor-oriented economists in the United States are especially wary of basic income, given that the American social safety programs have been significantly trimmed in recent decades, with welfare, unemployment benefits and food stamps all subject to a variety of restrictions. If basic income were to replace these components as one giant program \u2014 the proposal that would appeal to libertarians \u2014 it might beckon as a fat target for additional budget trimming.And some advocates for working people dismiss basic income as a wrongheaded approach to the real problem of not enough quality paychecks.\u201cPeople want to work,\u201d said the Nobel laureate economist Joseph E. Stiglitz when I asked him about basic income early this year. \u201cThey don\u2019t want handouts.\u201dYet some of the basic income experiments now underway are engineered precisely to encourage people to work while limiting their contact with public assistance.Finland\u2019s trial is giving jobless people the same amount of money they were already receiving in unemployment benefits, while relieving them of bureaucratic obligations. The bet is that people will use time now squandered submitting paperwork to train for better careers, start businesses, or take part-time jobs. Under the system the trial replaces, people living on benefits risk losing support if they secure other income.In short, basic income is being advanced not as a license for Finns to laze in the sauna, but as a means of enhancing the forces of creative destruction so central to capitalism. As the logic goes, once sustenance is eliminated as a worry, weak companies can be shuttered without concern for those thrown out of work, freeing up capital and talent for more productive ventures.The trials in the Netherlands, conducted at the municipal level, are similarly geared to paring bureaucracy from the unemployment system. Ditto, the Barcelona experiment.Silicon Valley has embraced basic income as a crucial element in enabling the continued rollout of automation. While engineers pioneer ways to replace human laborers with robots, financiers focus on basic income as a replacement for paychecks.The trial in Oakland was the work of Y Combinator, a start-up incubator. Its researchers handed out varying grants to a few dozen people as a simple feasibility test for basic income.The next phase is far more ambitious. The Y Combinator researchers plan to distribute grants to 3,000 people with below-average incomes in two as-yet undisclosed American states. They will hand out $1,000 a month to 1,000 people, no strings attached, and $50 a month to the rest, allowing for comparisons in how recipients use the money, and what impact it has on their lives.One key element of the basic income push is the assumption that poor people are better placed than bureaucrats to determine the most beneficial use of aid money. Rather than saddle recipients with complex rules and a dizzying array of programs, better to just give people money and let them sort out how to use it.This is a central idea of GiveDirectly\u2019s program in Kenya, where it began a pilot study last year in which it handed out small, unconditional cash grants \u2014 about $22 a month \u2014 to residents of a single village. The program is now expanding its sights, with plans to hand out grants to some 16,000 people in 120 villages.From a research standpoint, these remain early days for basic income, a time for experimentation and assessment before serious amounts of money may be devoted to a new model for public assistance.Yet from a political standpoint, basic income appears to have found its moment, one delivered by the anxieties of the working poor combined with those of the wealthy, who see in widening inequality the potential for mobs wielding pitchforks.\u201cThe interest is exploding everywhere,\u201d said Guy Standing, a research associate at SOAS University of London. \u201cThe debates now are extraordinarily fertile.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of money that researchers with Y Combinator plan to give 3,000 people as part of a study. While 1,000 people will receive $1,000 a month, the rest will receive $50 a month, not $500 a month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Again Wades Into Tax Debate, Suggesting Repeal of Obamacare Mandate", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Republican lawmakers worked on Monday toward a delicate compromise on a $1.5 trillion tax cut, President Trump threw himself back into the discussion, suggesting that Republicans could reduce taxes even further by repealing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that most people have health insurance.I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We\u2019re getting close! Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?Mr. Trump\u2019s latest suggestions came hours before the Senate Finance Committee met to begin its formal \u201cmarkup\u201d of the tax bill, a process that includes debate about the legislation and the consideration of amendments. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said on Monday that he hoped the bill would be ready to be considered by the full Senate the week after Thanksgiving.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has called for including the repeal of the individual mandate in the tax bill. Doing so would save more than $300 billion over a decade and would allow Republicans to boast that they took a step forward in dismantling a law that continues to haunt them.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Mr. Trump\u2019s opinion remained a factor as the House tried to pass its own tax bill this week.\u201cThe president has already indicated to me a number of times that he\u2019s really interested in including the individual mandate repeal,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cIt remains under consideration.\u201dMr. Brady added that he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that Republicans had the votes to pass the bill and that while he did not expect major changes to the legislation, there were important differences between the House and Senate bills that must eventually be bridged.We\u2019re asking for your help to identify loopholes, unintended consequences or errors in the Senate and House tax proposals.Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter messages about taxes have at times sowed confusion about the direction he wants to chart for the legislation.The president said previously that he wanted Republican negotiators to allow for a higher individual tax bracket to make sure that the bill was sufficiently progressive. The House plan would keep a top rate of 39.6 percent for millionaires and the Senate plan has a top rate of 38.5 percent for high earners. But Mr. Trump suggested on Monday that lawmakers lower the top rate to 35 percent while also giving deeper cuts to the middle class.Although Mr. Trump must sign the eventual legislation, Republican lawmakers have shown a willingness to break with his wishes. Mr. Trump originally called for a 15 percent corporate tax rate, but Senate Republicans appear to have settled on a 20 percent rate that will be delayed by a year. Senate Republicans also have ignored Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to fully eliminate the estate tax and, for now, they have not addressed the special treatment of \u201ccarried interest\u201d that gives hedge fund managers and private equity partners lower tax rates on their income.At the beginning of the Finance Committee\u2019s markup, which is expected to last several days, the panel\u2019s chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, offered a pre-emptive defense of the bill, both in terms of substance and process.Mr. Hatch dismissed Democrats\u2019 complaints, based on an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation, that the bill would raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, saying critics were \u201cmissing the forest for the trees.\u201d\u201cThe talking point is that 13 million families in the middle class will see their taxes go up next year if the bill becomes law,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. But, he said, critics should focus on the 90 percent of the middle class that would see a tax cut or no change under the bill.He also suggested that the Senate bill would keep the corporate rate cut permanent as Republicans amend the bill in the coming days to comply with special budget rules that will protect it from a Democratic filibuster.\u201cThere\u2019s no real cause for concern at this point,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cBut I do want to make clear that we\u2019re looking at a number of alternatives that will fill the necessary gaps and we have every intention of making the business reforms permanent.\u201dSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, warned that Republicans had drawn up legislation that would hurt millions of middle-class taxpayers.Because Republicans are planning to pass the bill under the rules that shield it from a filibuster, \u201cthey\u2019ve got to squeeze several trillion dollars of tax handouts and corporate goodies into a $1.5 trillion box,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cThat means telling the middle class in America to pay up.\u201dJim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At UEFA, Mounting Concern About A.C. Milan\u2019s Murky Finances", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEuropean soccer\u2019s governing body, UEFA, is concerned about Milan\u2019s financial viability under its Chinese owner, and without a resolution Milan could face sanctions that include a ban from the continental competition it once ruled. Facing mounting concern over its violations of so-called financial fair play rules, created to keep clubs from spending more than they bring in, Milan\u2019s management is trying to persuade regulators that its new Chinese owner, Li Yonghong, is capable of stopping the team\u2019s bleeding millions of euros a year.Those losses, fueled by more than $270 million in spending to acquire nearly a dozen new players last summer, surpass limits imposed on teams allowed to compete in UEFA\u2019s two main club competitions: the Champions League and the second-tier Europa League.Two weeks ago, a Milan delegation led by the club\u2019s chief executive, Marco Fassone, and Li\u2019s top deputy at the club, David Han Li, visited UEFA\u2019s lakeside headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, but a four-hour meeting and 160-page presentation outlining a four-year plan and a variety of multiple financial forecasts only produced more questions.Milan is in a critical period on and off the field. Despite spending far more than any of its domestic rivals on players last summer, Mr. Li\u2019s first since his purchase, Milan is struggling in seventh place in Italy\u2019s top division, Serie A, and remains 11 points out of the fourth-place position that would grant it access to the glamour and the riches of the Champions League next season.Even with that income, the club\u2019s ability to break even seems unlikely. Without it, meeting the financial fair play limits would be all but impossible. At the same time, the team is facing a race against time to repay a high-interest, $354 million loan to the hedge fund firm Elliott Management \u2014 which financed Mr. Li\u2019s purchase \u2014 by next year. Should it default, Elliot would be able to take control of the club.UEFA will decide Milan\u2019s fate on Dec. 8. Since many new owners take control of troubled clubs, they are allowed some leeway on the financial fair play regulations \u2014 provided they can convince UEFA they can bankroll a financial turnaround. Mr. Li\u2019s past financial disputes with regulators and others in China worry UEFA\u2019s inspectors, according to a person familiar with the talks.Should UEFA reject the request, Milan will face a range of penalties that could include exclusion from the competitions in which it made its name.UEFA has so far excluded three clubs for financial fair play breaches: Russia\u2019s Dynamo Moscow, Turkey\u2019s Galatasaray and the Bulgarian club CSKA Sofia. Other penalties include fines \u2014 sometimes in the millions of euros \u2014 as well as reductions in squad sizes and bans on registering new players.An A.C. Milan spokesman said Wednesday that the club\u2019s management remains confident it can reach an agreement with UEFA.Mr. Li\u2019s $860 million takeover of Milan was the biggest among a number of Chinese buyouts in global soccer in recent years. It also was the most-protracted: Mr. Li missed several deadlines to complete the purchase and had to turn to Elliott at the last moment after potential business partners pulled out.With the clock ticking on the Elliott loan, Mr. Li is rushing to refinance the debt with a different hedge fund, according to a person familiar with the talks. Italian news media reports said the talks are with HPS Investment Partners, formerly a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

{"Headline": "Arjay Miller, Who Led a Resurgence at Ford, Dies at 101", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArjay Miller, who as Ford Motor Company president modernized the company\u2019s management and marketed the original Mustangs, and who then switched to academia and elevated Stanford to the top ranks of America\u2019s graduate business schools, died on Friday at his home in Woodside, Calif. He was 101.The cause was a stroke, his son, Kenneth, said.Raised as a Nebraska farm boy, Mr. Miller was one of the so-called whiz kids who persuaded Ford to hire them in the late 1940s from Harvard, where they had perfected statistical management techniques for the Army Air Forces.Originally called the \u201cquiz kids\u201d because they peppered their Ford colleagues with probing questions, the team included Robert S. McNamara, who would also become a Ford president and later secretary of defense in the administrations of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.During Mr. Miller\u2019s presidency, Ford reported record sales and earnings, introduced the Mustang and other slick-back models and revolutionized its stodgy management and financial practices.When Congress demanded that Detroit do more to prevent accidents, Ford responded proactively by acknowledging that the industry had been slow to embrace auto safety and pledging to support whatever federal researchers recommended.As the dean of the Graduate School of Business at Stanford, in Palo Alto, Calif., for a decade, Mr. Miller expanded the curriculum to include public policy, social issues and ethics; hired the first women onto the faculty; recruited more minority students; increased the endowment; and upgraded the school into a worthy challenger to the business schools of Harvard and the University of Chicago.Mr. Miller was no ivory-tower dreamer or Detroit desk jockey, though.After riots devastated the slums of Detroit and other cities in the summer of 1967, he was named by President Johnson to a board that helped found the Urban Institute to address the underlying causes of the unrest. He also founded the Economic Development Corporation of Greater Detroit to support black-owned and black-operated businesses.Mr. Miller was the first major business executive to advocate a negative income tax to alleviate poverty \u2014 that is, giving a family with no income a basic grant and reducing but not eliminating it as the family gained income from other sources.His political philosophy combined social conscience with self-interest.\u201cAll we need to stay in business and grow,\u201d he once said, \u201cis to have more people and higher incomes.\u201dHe was credited with having an encyclopedic arsenal of facts and figures and an insatiable curiosity, which he had evidenced since childhood, when he completely dismantled a vintage Model T that he bought for $10 to understand how it worked.\u201cThe rescue of Ford from a morass of internecine chicanery and chaos cannot be laid at a single person\u2019s feet,\u201d Hemmings Classic Car magazine said in 2007, \u201cbut Miller unquestionably did a great deal of the heavy lifting to save the company.\u201cUnlike most heroes of the car business, he was not an engineer, stylist or designated product planner,\u201d the magazine continued. \u201cMiller was, instead, a person who could reconcile the realities of interpreting reams of data and inspiring others to apply it logically. His talent allowed him, in turn, to manage an unprecedented war, to help remake a troubled manufacturing giant, and to realize his ultimate legacy by grooming a new generation of top executives.\u201dArjay Ray Miller was born on March 4, 1916, in Shelby, Neb., a village west of Omaha. The youngest of eight children, he was named for the first initials of his father, Rawley John Miller, a farmer. His mother was the former Mary Schade.\u201cI always thought it was some help coming from a rural situation,\u201d Mr. Miller told The New York Times in 1966. \u201cYou aren\u2019t so perplexed about the world: Milk came from a cow, not from the grocery store. Eggs came from a chicken.\u201dAfter the family moved west, he earned a bachelor of science degree in finance and banking from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1937. As a teaching fellow and graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, he completed all the requirements for a doctorate except for his dissertation, then worked as an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.Once the United States entered World War II, he tried to enlist in the military but was initially rejected because of poor eyesight. He was later drafted into the Army Air Forces, where he taught prospective pilots on a flight simulator and then was enrolled in a statistical regime for officers at Harvard.When the war ended and he was discharged as a captain, Mr. Miller and the other nine members of his Harvard statistics group pitched themselves as a package deal to 100 companies. Only one, the Alleghany Corporation, responded.Before they could be interviewed there, Mr. Miller saw a cover article in Life magazine about Henry Ford II\u2019s search for executive talent to revive the company, which had been losing money for 15 consecutive years, and retool it to a civilian economy.After they sent a telegram to Ford requesting a meeting about \u201ca matter of management importance,\u201d the company hired all 10.Mr. Miller started in the finance department\u2019s analysis unit. Focusing on marketing and engineering, he was promoted to a vice presidency in 1957 and was named Ford\u2019s seventh president in 1963.\u201cWe\u2019re lucky in the auto business,\u201d he told The Boston Globe in 1966. \u201cSo many businesses have to work hard to create a demand. But for us, the minute a kid hits 16 he automatically wants a car.\u201dYet he resented the notion that he was just an astute bean counter.\u201cWe weren\u2019t a bunch of accountants,\u201d he told Automotive News in 2003. \u201cWe knew the importance of people.\u201dMr. Miller married Frances Fearing, an economist, in 1940; she died in 2010. They lived in Ann Arbor, Mich., a university town, rather than in Grosse Pointe or Bloomfield Hills, which were hubs for wealthy automobile executives.In addition to their son, Mr. Miller is survived by their daughter, Ann Elizabeth Olstad; three granddaughters; and seven great-grandchildren.In 1968, policy differences prompted Mr. Ford to name a new president. Mr. Miller became vice chairman of the company and dean at Stanford. He left as vice chairman a year later but stayed on the board until 1986.While his salary dropped to about $40,000 a year from more than $400,000, he had always preferred academia \u2014 and besides, he still held Ford stock. He remained as dean at Stanford until 1979.Mr. Miller was a leading proponent of incorporating ethics and social responsibility into the curriculum to lay the groundwork for cooperation between government and business.\u201cThere are plenty of people in jail today,\u201d he said, \u201cwho passed college ethics courses.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "America Is Not a \u2018Center-Right Nation\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThis argument may sound coolheaded and pragmatic. But its core premises \u2014 that American voters are hostile to progressive economics and have punished the (increasingly left-wing) Democratic Party accordingly \u2014 actually rest on ideological conviction, not empirical evidence.In truth, the Republican Party\u2019s dominance has little to do with the American electorate\u2019s \u201ccenter-right\u201d ideology. We know this for two simple reasons: First, the vast majority of that electorate has no ideology, whatsoever. And second, when polled on discrete policy questions, Americans consistently express majoritarian support for a left-of-center economic agenda.This make intuitive sense: The left-to-right political spectrum is a construct born of seating arrangements during the French Revolution. The impulse to define oneself in relation to an in-group \u2014 and opposition to an out-group \u2014 is a survival strategy that\u2019s been with us since the dawn of our species.Meanwhile, the number of genuine \u201cliberals\u201d and \u201cconservatives\u201d is far smaller than meets the eye. Most voters who identify with those terms are partisans first, and ideologues second. Or as Mr. Kinder and Mr. Kalmoe conclude an analysis of four decades of voter survey data, \u201cideological identification seems more a reflection of political decisions than a cause.\u201d In other words: The average conservative Republican isn\u2019t a Republican because she\u2019s a conservative \u2014 she self-identifies as a conservative because she\u2019s a Republican.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why a Firm Believer in Tax Cuts Could Derail the Senate Tax Cut Plan", "Date": "2017-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On the eve of the House\u2019s vote to pass a far-reaching $1.5 trillion tax cut, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin placed a hasty phone call to his state\u2019s senior senator, Ron Johnson, in hopes of resolving an unlikely conflict in his own back yard.Mr. Johnson had become the first Senate Republican to say publicly that he could not vote for the Senate\u2019s version of the tax bill. During the phone call on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Ryan, who had campaigned heavily for Mr. Johnson in 2016, posed an essential question, according to the senator: \u201cWhat are you going to need?\u201d\u201cI just have in my heart a real affinity for these owner-operated pass-throughs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make American businesses competitive \u2014 they\u2019re not right now. But in making businesses competitive, we can\u2019t leave behind the pass-throughs.\u201dThe sudden fissure between longtime allies laid bare the challenge that Republicans face as the tax bill leaves Mr. Ryan\u2019s care and navigates the rough waters of the Senate, where different priorities within the party could sink the bill if not adequately addressed.Senate Republican leaders, who are seeking a major legislative victory before year\u2019s end, hope to bring their tax bill, which differs significantly from the House measure, to a vote after Thanksgiving. But it is unclear whether it has enough support to pass in the narrowly divided chamber.Offering concessions to skeptical senators one by one could prove an impossible task for Republican leaders, who face restraints under Senate rules on the total size of the tax cut package. Those leaders are hoping, instead, that they can pull off a version of Mr. Ryan\u2019s strategy: all but daring holdouts to derail the party\u2019s top priority.Republicans, who control Congress and the White House, are desperately seeking their first significant legislative achievement of the Trump presidency. Mr. Johnson\u2019s public wavering elicited calls from President Trump and a visit from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, chairman of the National Economic Council, all of whom sounded out Mr. Johnson about his concerns.Mr. Johnson is a firm believer in the power of tax cuts to lift economic growth. He grew up on a Minnesota farm, worked as an accountant after college, and spent more than 30 years immersed in his family\u2019s plastics company before assuming his Senate seat in 2010.A comparison of tax rates under the current law vs. the Senate tax bill\u2019s proposed changes.Since winning re-election in 2016, he has not shied from voicing displeasure with the Republican leadership. He was an early and vocal critic of the party\u2019s legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, though he ultimately voted in favor of the bill.His concerns with the Senate\u2019s tax bill stem not from its overarching goal of cutting taxes but with how the bill treats small businesses and large corporations. Mr. Johnson says the legislation is tilted in favor of big companies, and he is eager to find a way to level the playing field.Mr. Ryan, who was his party\u2019s 2012 vice-presidential nominee, helped Mr. Johnson\u2019s ascendance to the Senate. Mr. Ryan barnstormed Wisconsin on Mr. Johnson\u2019s behalf as his come-from-behind re-election bid took off last year, and the two have forged a bond in Washington.But the dynamics of the two chambers differ markedly. With the House tax bill, Mr. Ryan and other Republican leaders employed a command-and-control process and a rocket-speed schedule to minimize Republican dissent. The strategy worked: The bill sailed through the House on Thursday along party lines, two weeks after it was introduced.In the Senate, where the party\u2019s margins are much smaller and individual members are more powerful, party leaders will need to win over what could be a half-dozen or more wavering Republicans, beginning with Mr. Johnson. Others include Senators Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and John McCain.The Senate bill cleared the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday night. Before he can support it, Mr. Johnson said, he wants to see changes in its treatment of pass-through entities to put them on equal footing with corporations. While rates would fall for Mr. Johnson\u2019s family business under the Senate bill, they would not fall as much as those for larger businesses.The pass-through treatment has earned the endorsement of the National Federation of Independent Business, the powerful lobbying group for small businesses. \u201cWe very much like the Senate bill \u2014 it\u2019s a really good deal for the vast majority of pass-through businesses,\u201d said Jack Mozloom, a spokesman for the group. \u201cBased on our analysis, we think it\u2019s going to provide them with a substantial tax cut.\u201dMr. Johnson launched the family\u2019s plastics sheeting company in 1979 with his brother-in-law. Over the course of his career, he said, he has seen many family-run companies \u2014 his customers \u2014 be snapped up by larger corporations, or fold after being unable to compete with them. He said that the tax code unfairly advantaged those corporations, and that the Senate tax bill would widen those advantages, by cutting corporate taxes more substantially than those for pass-through businesses.Mr. Johnson\u2019s preferred approach to that imbalance would be to force all corporations to become pass-throughs, a move he says would equalize tax treatment and encourage more corporate investment. He says this approach would not personally benefit him because it would not cut taxes on pass-throughs; Mr. Johnson earned between $215,000 and just over $2 million in pass-through income in 2016, through several limited liability companies.But Mr. Johnson concedes that his Republican colleagues do not seem likely to add such a provision to their tax bill. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s pretty late in the game.\u201dAnd so the question becomes: What changes would he accept?Republican leaders will probably need to pose that question to several senators in the days to come. Mr. Flake, of Arizona, and Mr. Corker, of Tennessee, have raised concerns over how much the bill would add to the budget deficit, particularly if Republicans do not allow all individual \u2014 and pass-through \u2014 tax breaks to expire at the end of 2025, as the bill currently calls for.Mr. Johnson suggested in the interview that if the Senate did not force all companies to operate as pass-throughs, it should at least cut their taxes further to equalize their treatment with larger corporations. Such cuts, he acknowledged, would be expensive in terms of lost tax revenues, and Republicans must stay within the $1.5 trillion limit for additional deficits in order to pass the tax bill on a party-line vote.The senator said he would have preferred if Republicans, in an earlier budget bill, had set that limit higher, at $2 trillion or $3 trillion.For now, Mr. Johnson said he was gathering information and trying to work with administration officials on identifying the group of pass-through companies that most need additional help.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic\u201d that solutions will be found, Mr. Johnson said, \u201cbecause we all understand how important this is. I don\u2019t want to block this. There\u2019s no way I want to block this.\u201dSenate leaders are counting on that attitude, as they try to replicate Mr. Ryan\u2019s success in the House. They believe that on a core conservative issue, at a time when the party is still searching for a signature legislative victory under Mr. Trump, no senator will want to be the one who blocks the bill.They also note that even though Mr. Johnson raised similarly loud concerns over the party\u2019s failed health care bill earlier this year, in the end, he voted for it.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the state where Senator Ron Johnson grew up.

That\u2019s a departure from the days when tech start-ups preferred old warehouses and office buildings converted into wide-open loft offices. Full of exposed brick, wooden beams, high ceilings and concrete floors, the funky work spaces gave birth to tech enclaves in places like San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood and Manhattan\u2019s Flatiron district.Tenants in the technology, creative and media industries leased more than 8.5 million square feet in trophy buildings in the United States over the 12 months that ended in the first quarter of 2017, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, the Chicago-based commercial real estate brokerage firm. That amounted to 22 percent of all trophy space leased over the period, a year-over-year increase of seven percentage points. It was also second only to the banking and finance sector in total square feet leased.Recent notable tech deals include Facebook\u2019s lease of 436,000 square feet in a new office and residential tower in downtown San Francisco, Spotify\u2019s lease of 378,000 square feet in 4 World Trade Center in Manhattan and HomeAway\u2019s lease of an entire 315,000-square-foot office building under construction in the Domain mixed-use neighborhood in Austin, Tex.But companies in all sectors today \u2014 not just tech \u2014 are demanding the design elements typically found in the warehouse conversions, such as open floor plans, natural light and exposed ceilings. Along with proximity to transit and amenities, layout is considered an important tool to recruit and retain workers, and developers are obliging tenants in new buildings and those in retrofitted older buildings, particularly modern offices built in the 1980s and later.\u201cIt turns out that we look really smart,\u201d said Mr. Daniels, whose early efforts to develop the Mark were halted by the Great Recession. \u201cBut it was kind of nerve-racking at the time.\u201dReal estate professionals say older buildings generally lack modern energy efficiencies, elevators, bathrooms and data capabilities. The inability to expand in the converted buildings and their scarcity are also restrictive.\u201cWe\u2019re creating an atmosphere of fun, fitness and food, because that\u2019s what tenants are looking for,\u201d Mr. Meghji said. \u201cThe role of landlords has evolved \u2014 today it\u2019s about providing an experience.\u201dMr. Daniels added a hotel and event space to the Mark when he resumed development after the recession. The additions appealed to F5 Networks, which ended up leasing 516,000 square feet of space. The changes helped round out the building\u2019s amenity package, which includes lounges, restaurants and a fitness facility.\u201cIt all brings a lot more life after 5,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \u201cThe younger set really likes to be entertained \u2014 at all times \u2014 whether it\u2019s by food, drink or games. They\u2019ve got to have it.\u201d\u201cSan Francisco certainly has morphed into more of a \u2018big tech\u2019 market, and the companies are all looking at new buildings,\u201d Mr. Sammons said. \u201cI think landlords are feeling much more confident in the market\u2019s long term than they were a couple of years ago, when many tech tenants were start-ups.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel\u2019s Coalition Talks in Germany Go Into Overtime", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel and representatives of three German parties returned to the negotiating table in Berlin on Friday afternoon, in a last-ditch effort to define the terms of a future government coalition, after 15 tense hours of debate on issues like migration ended in deadlock overnight.Leaders of the parties, the business-friendly Free Democrats, the ecologist Greens and the Bavarian-only Christian Social Union, which forms a conservative bloc with Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, appeared refreshed and resolved to extend negotiations into the weekend.\u201cI am heading into these negotiations with the intention, despite all the difficulties, of carrying out the task voters gave us of forming a coalition,\u201d Ms. Merkel told reporters outside her party headquarters, where the next round of talks are being held.The talks serve to define the terms to be used in formal negotiations on building a coalition government. But bringing together four parties is a complex and difficult task, and deep differences remain over policies on refugees and migration, finance and climate change, especially between the Greens, the Free Democrats and the conservatives \u2014 whose experience in working together has previously been in opposition to one another.Ms. Merkel, who remains committed to the idea of \u201cstrength in calm\u201d and is experienced in difficult discussions, appeared resolved to play a long game to ensure her fourth term in office.\u201cIt will be tough, but it\u2019s worth going into round two,\u201d said the chancellor, who had previously set the deadline for an agreement to be reached by Friday in hopes of having a new government in place by the end of the year.Failure to reach an agreement could have wide-ranging implications for Germany, the European Union and beyond. Ms. Merkel could still try to approach the Social Democrats, her governing partners since 2013, but they suffered losses in the vote and have vowed to take time out in the opposition to regroup.Failure to find any partners to form a government would mean President Frank-Walter Steinmeier would most likely nominate Ms. Merkel as chancellor, given that her party has the largest bloc in Parliament. If lawmakers voted to confirm her nomination, she would have to choose between leading a minority government \u2014 novel in Germany\u2019s post-World War II history \u2014 or dissolving Parliament, which would lead to new elections within two months.Many in Berlin fear a fresh round of elections would further frustrate voters and strengthen the position of the far right. Despite the apparent unwillingness to bend on campaign promises, no one wants to be seen as the party that brought down the coalition.\u201cUnderstanding and compromise, which must constitute the coalition, are nothing new in the German system of consensus,\u201d wrote Nico Fried in an editorial in the left-leaning S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cPoliticians who, by all understandable differences, are unable to find a viable compromise on which to build a coalition, will only disgrace themselves in the eyes of the people.\u201d\u201cThe responsibility for the people and the future of our country unites us,\u201d read the opening paragraph of a draft document circulated late Thursday, as the talks entered what was supposed to be their final round.\u201cThrough the outcome of the election, we are faced with the task of building a capable and successful government,\u201d the preliminary agreement read.Each side brought its own agenda to the table, as well as fears of being punished by voters if they gave up too much on campaign promises. The Free Democrats, for instance, have just returned to Parliament after four years without representation, drawing 10.7 percent of the vote. Before that barren spell, they spent four years as a junior coalition partner in Ms. Merkel\u2019s government, which many in the party see as having cost them seats.With a state election looming next year, the Christian Social Union is concerned that it could lose its majority in the Bavarian legislature if it is perceived as weak on immigration. A power struggle for the leadership of the Christian Social Union has further complicated the talks.But the Greens consider a cap on the number of people that Germany can take in for humanitarian reasons a \u201cno-go.\u201d While the party has been willing to water down its demands on several climate issues, it is adamant that Germany not abandon its humanitarian principles.Beyond migration, the parties also differ in how far they would like to go in their commitment to combating climate change, on domestic spending and on the role the country should play in Europe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Did Bernie Sanders Learn in His Weekend in Canada?", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 As he tells it, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont fell in love with the Canadian health system 20 years ago when he brought a busload of his constituents across the border to buy cheaper prescription drugs. Now he wants to make Americans fall in love with his proposal to make the United States system a lot more like Canada\u2019s.That\u2019s one reason he took the equivalent of a busload of staffers, American health care providers and journalists to Toronto last weekend, in a two-day trip that was part immersion, part publicity tour. Canadian government officials and hospital executives showed him high-tech care, compassionate providers and satisfied patients, all as videographers recorded.He ended the trip with a speech at the University of Toronto titled, \u201cWhat the U.S. Can Learn From Canadian Health Care.\u201dBut our question is this: What did Bernie Sanders learn from his weekend in Canada?Mr. Sanders \u2014 after wedging himself into Row 21 and taking extensive notes on a legal pad during the flight \u2014 had barely gotten off the plane in Toronto when an airport security guard chased him down the hallway, telling him, \u201cYou\u2019re like a hero to me.\u201dA team of cardiac nurses at Toronto General Hospital asked to take pictures after he toured their unit. At a full 1,600-seat university auditorium on Sunday, he received repeated and sustained standing ovations. College students waited for hours to get into the auditorium and see him speak.Mr. Sanders, who drew huge crowds as a presidential candidate in the United States last year, learned firsthand that he is also a household name in Toronto. His policy vision, decidedly from the left in the United States, matches mainstream Canadian views.\u201cYou received the welcome here that is normally reserved for celebrity rock stars,\u201d said Greg Marchildon, the director of the North American Observatory on Health Systems and Policies at the University of Toronto.Ed Broadbent, the chairman of the progressive Broadbent Institute, called Mr. Sanders the most important social democrat in North America \u2014 even though Mr. Sanders is not a Canadian social democrat, and is not even a particularly powerful member of the Senate.Many developed countries have achieved universal health coverage, but Canada is relatively distinct in its insistence that individuals should not have to pay any money at the point of care. When Canadians go to the doctor or hospital, they just show their Canadian \u201cMedicare\u201d card.At Women\u2019s College Hospital, executives showed Mr. Sanders an empty billing window. The hospital, they told him, has one employee who manages bills. \u201cFor the entire hospital?\u201d Mr. Sanders said, in mock disbelief.Several patients told him about the comfort that comes from not having to pay for their care directly. And doctors, too, said they felt more comfortable recommending their patients get an operation or see a specialist than they might if those treatments weren\u2019t free.\u201cI didn\u2019t have to fill out any forms; I didn\u2019t have to worry about how I was going to pay for the simple job of staying alive,\u201d said Lilac Chow, a kidney transplant patient at Toronto General Hospital, who had been brought in to share her experience with the senator.Whenever Mr. Sanders was asked what he learned about the Canadian system, the value of free care came up.\u201cWhat I think stuck out to me was from both the patients and the physicians, the importance of not having to worry about money in terms of the doctor-patient relationship,\u201d he said in an interview after his trip on Tuesday.His Medicare-for-All bill includes free care as a central feature. If the legislation became law, no American would pay directly for a doctor, dentist or hospital visit, and co-payments for prescription drugs would be limited. (Taxpayers would, of course, finance the system.)At a round-table discussion at Women\u2019s College Hospital, the chief of surgery noted that Canadian patients can\u2019t always get all the care they want right away. \u201cWait times, you could argue are a problem for certain procedures,\u201d said Dr. David Urbach, before discussing the ways the province and hospital were working to shorten the lines. Mr. Sanders quickly turned to the glass-half-full interpretation. \u201cWhat you are arguing \u2014 correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 is that waiting times are not a problem, and it\u2019s an issue you are dealing with,\u201d he said.The Canadian system puts hospitals on a budget and limits the number of specialists it trains, both factors that can lead to lines for complex care that\u2019s not life-threatening. The system also limits access to services, like M.R.I. scans, that are much more abundant south of the border.On his weekend tour, Mr. Sanders didn\u2019t see the places where patients might wait. Hospital executives instead showed him a refugee primary care clinic, a neonatal intensive care unit and a cardiac surgery unit.But he points out that many Americans who are uninsured \u2014 or who have limited savings and insurance with high deductibles \u2014 may wait even longer than Canadians for elective, or even urgent, care.\u201cIf you\u2019re very, very rich, you\u2019ll get the highest-quality care immediately in the United States,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, in the interview. \u201cIf you\u2019re working class, if you\u2019re middle class, it is a very, very different story.\u201dAssessing the systems in eight countries can inform the debate in the U.S. over universal coverage.Mr. Sanders wants to bring big, sweeping change to the American health care system. Unlike the Affordable Care Act, which filled in holes in an existing system, his Medicare-for-All plan would take away the health coverage that most Americans hold now, replacing it with a single, very generous government system. It would do away with the premiums, deductibles and co-payments that individuals and businesses pay for health care, and instead impose large tax increases.Yet even in Canada, he learned, changes to the health care system have been difficult. The Canadian system, with insurance run at the province level, covers doctors and hospitals. But decades after the 1984 Canada Health Act, many Canadians pay for supplemental private insurance through their jobs for prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry \u2014 despite a growing recognition that medications are essential to care.\u201cAny one of us around the table is just a job loss away from having access to prescription medications, and that\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Danielle Martin, a vice president at Women\u2019s College Hospital and policy researcher, who helped organize the trip, at a round-table discussion.\u201cI\u2019m on my own going to the dentist,\u201d said Naomi Duguid, a patient, sitting across the table. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time I get to experience what it must be like to be an uninsured American.\u201dOntario has recently started a program that will provide coverage for medications to residents under 25. And there is a patchwork of drug coverage programs for older people, the poor and those who get insurance from work. But even in Canada, it\u2019s tough to find the resources to expand coverage.\u201cWe have to find the money to fund the program up front,\u201d said Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, who helped establish the youth drug coverage program.Equity. Fairness. Throughout the weekend, Mr. Sanders kept asking Canadians what they thought about the higher taxes they\u2019d paid to finance their system. Every one among the patients and doctors selected to meet him said the trade-off was worth it because it made the system fair.\u201cI think it\u2019s a really fair way to do it,\u201d said Frederick Brownridge, 67, of Etobicoke, Ontario, as he sat by the window in his Toronto General Hospital room, with IV lines in his arms. Mr. Brownridge had had two heart valves repaired and a double bypass three days earlier. \u201cIt also means if you\u2019re in a lower economic status or higher economic status, you\u2019ll get the treatment you need.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Sanders said the uniformity of this message really stuck out to him: \u201cThere really is, I think, a deep-seated belief in Canada that health care is a right, and whether you\u2019re rich or whether you\u2019re poor or whether you\u2019re middle class, you are entitled to health care.\u201dIn the United States, though, Republicans control the presidency and the Congress, and many candidates last year ran on a promise to roll back government support for health care coverage.Mr. Sanders said he knows his bill isn\u2019t going to become law anytime soon, but he thinks discussing the idea will help make its underlying values more broadly acceptable.\u201cWhen you talk about health care, you\u2019re not just talking about health care,\u201d he said in his Toronto speech. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about values, because how a society deals with health care is more than medicine. It\u2019s more than technology. It is about the values that those societies hold dear.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Hedge Fund Manager Committed Fraud. Would the U.S. Let Him Go?", "Date": "2017-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 Forty inmates lined up for the daily mail call at the Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution, a complex of low-slung brick buildings in the middle of New Jersey.It was July 2012, and one of the inmates was Philip Baker. A former hedge fund manager, he was serving a 20-year sentence for fraud. He had used bogus performance data to lure hundreds of people and institutions into his fund. His investors had lost hundreds of millions of dollars.Mr. Baker, 46 at the time, admitted that he had committed fraud. \u201cI\u2019m a criminal,\u201d he said recently. But he had convinced himself that he deserved to be free. And he was waiting for a letter that might turn his fantasy into reality.Months earlier, Mr. Baker, who is Canadian, had signed a plea agreement that included an unusual caveat: Prosecutors would not object to the Justice Department\u2019s transferring him to Canada to serve out his sentence.Such transfers were rare. But Mr. Baker knew that if he could persuade the Justice Department to give him one, Canada would probably parole him after he had served only a fraction of his prison term.Mr. Baker, a Baptist, prayed for God\u2019s guidance. \u201cOnly he could set my direction straight,\u201d he said during one in a series of interviews about his life and crimes.In the prison\u2019s television room, a guard dispensing the mail called out inmates\u2019 names and numbers.\u201cPhilip Baker, 22856-424.\u201dMr. Baker stepped forward. The guard handed him a thin envelope with a Justice Department return address. Assuming it was more paperwork, he tore it open \u2014 and could not believe what he saw.He started to tremble. He felt people staring at him.\u201cI felt like throwing up,\u201d he said.After the financial crisis last decade, the federal government was expected to aggressively pursue criminal cases against top financiers: the fund managers, bankers, mortgage lenders and Wall Street executives who helped cause the global economy to crater. But prosecutions have been rare. The exceptions have been obscure or relatively junior industry players against whom it was easy to build cases but who did not bear primary responsibility for the crisis.One reason: Prosecutors were under pressure to move quickly and to not lose trials. They preferred to take the safest, simplest routes to win convictions, and to then move on to new cases.That is what happened with Mr. Baker, who became a top target. The government labeled him a fugitive, made him the subject of an international manhunt and, eventually, extradited him from Germany, where he had been living with his wife.Mr. Baker was not a big fish; his hedge fund had under $1 billion in assets. And even when he was apprehended, a desire to resolve the case swiftly led a powerful United States attorney to insert the transfer-to-Canada clause into an otherwise airtight plea agreement.His experience highlights one of the primary critiques of the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to clean up Wall Street: Bankers nearly destroyed the global economy, but few went to jail.This account of Mr. Baker\u2019s long-shot effort to escape to Canada, which has not previously been reported, is based on interviews with him and his family, and with his lawyers, former colleagues and current and former government officials, as well as on thousands of pages of legal documents, internal emails and other records from Mr. Baker\u2019s defunct hedge fund.Philip Baker was raised in a middle-class family in Toronto. One of his earliest memories took place in the hospital. Born with a heart defect, he needed surgery when he was 7. When it was time for the procedure, his parents walked out of his hospital room.\u201cI thought they were abandoning me,\u201d he said. That fear stayed with him, fostering a desire to please his parents and other authority figures.As a boy, he showed an affinity for finance. While his friends played with toy soldiers, he toted a leather briefcase and pretended to be a stockbroker.But his early years in the financial industry were rocky. After dropping out of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., he eventually landed at the brokerage Refco. Colleagues remember an insecure man whose nickname was \u201cPhilipbuster,\u201d because of his tendency to talk endlessly.He married a woman from a wealthy Canadian family, heirs to the Hollinger media fortune. The couple had five children in Windsor, Ontario.\u201cI was always trying to impress that family,\u201d Mr. Baker said. Hoping to prove that he could succeed as an entrepreneur, he quit Refco to start his own hedge fund.The fund failed.Mr. Baker lied to his wife and in-laws that he had found a new job at a big Detroit bank. For several months, he put on a suit and pretended to cross the Detroit River and go to work.One day, he said, his wife tried to call him at the office. The bank told her that nobody named Philip Baker worked there.Mr. Baker recalls her words to him that evening, when he came home: \u201cGet out.\u201d The marriage was over. (She declined to be interviewed.)He holed up in a friend\u2019s basement. One morning, he grabbed a .22-caliber rifle and drove to a forest outside town. He called a former Refco colleague, John Kurgan, and said he was preparing to kill himself.\u201cSlow down a minute, cowboy,\u201d Mr. Kurgan responded. He told Mr. Baker he had a job prospect for him in Toronto. Then, noting that Mr. Baker had called in on a recorded Refco line, Mr. Kurgan jokingly asked if he could sell the audio of his suicide.Mr. Baker was infuriated by the comment. But it snapped him out of his suicidal stupor.What happened next set the stage for Mr. Baker\u2019s later downfall.According to Mr. Baker and to his plea agreement, he and Mr. Kurgan went into business together. They formed a new commodities-trading hedge fund, Lake Shore Asset Management. Mr. Baker lined up clients, and Mr. Kurgan did much of the trading.Mr. Kurgan was not charged with wrongdoing. In an interview, he declined to describe his role in the business. \u201cThis is something that happened many years ago,\u201d he said.Mr. Baker set up shop in another basement \u2014 this one in his parents\u2019 home, north of Toronto. He raised more than $10 million for the fund. A tiny sum in hedge-fund terms, but enough that Lake Shore was able to start trading in February 2002.The fund got off to a spectacularly bad start. That summer, a single futures trade lost 48 percent of the fund\u2019s assets. Mr. Baker blamed Mr. Kurgan for the bad trade.To hide the loss, Lake Shore concocted data that showed a stellar performance. Mr. Baker shared the bogus numbers with current and prospective clients. One marketing brochure cited annual returns of more than 30 percent. Another claimed falsely that the firm had a 14-year investing record.Mr. Kurgan, now working at Royal Bank of Canada, accused Mr. Baker of \u201ctrying to muddy my name\u201d and noted that \u201cthe justice system obviously found him guilty.\u201d Mr. Kurgan did not respond to detailed follow-up questions sent to him by email.Mr. Baker knew he was committing fraud. \u201cI failed to stand up for my clients,\u201d he said, adding that he did not want to betray Mr. Kurgan, whom he credited with preventing his suicide. \u201cI became too loyal.\u201dThe firm attracted hundreds of new clients. Royal Bank of Canada invested millions of dollars, as did EquiGenesis, a Toronto money manager specializing in tax-efficient investing and charitable giving. Lake Shore \u201ccreated an impression of credibility,\u201d said Kenneth M. Gordon, EquiGenesis\u2019s president.Lake Shore\u2019s staff grew to more than a dozen traders and salespeople. It opened offices in London and Geneva. Prominent finance executives, including Laurence Rosenberg, the former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, joined the board.Mr. Baker bought bespoke suits. He hired a butler. At a club in Hamburg, Germany, one night, he met Kristina Malychenko, a tall blonde from Kazakhstan. They started dating.Mr. Baker was earning millions \u2014 more than $7 million in the first half of 2007 alone, he said. He felt like he was proving himself. \u201cI chased pride and vanity,\u201d he said. He described himself as being \u201con the cusp of happiness.\u201dLake Shore wanted to enter the American market. It set up a website aimed at investors in United States.That turned out to be a crucial mistake. A self-regulatory organization, the National Futures Association, started scrutinizing Lake Shore. The group alerted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to what appeared to be suspicious claims on the website. The commission concluded that Lake Shore had been soliciting American clients without legal authorization.Mr. Kurgan began to distance himself from the fund. He emailed Mr. Baker: \u201cIf, through your kindness, you have listed me as either, director, partner or any other title with any of the Lake Shore entities please remove my name at once.\u201dAs investigators dug in, they realized the fund had been lying about its history and performance.The problems deepened in August 2007, when the cash-management firm holding Lake Shore\u2019s assets filed for bankruptcy. What little money the firm\u2019s clients had left was now stuck in an insolvent firm.\u201cI felt like Napoleon being attacked by all sides,\u201d Mr. Baker said.Lake Shore shipped many of its files and computer hard drives to Geneva. Mr. Baker\u2019s lawyer refused to hand over the materials to the Americans, citing Swiss bank-secrecy laws.\u201cWe invested money in good faith based on representations they made, and then the money vanished,\u201d Mr. Gordon of EquiGenesis said. \u201cIt was a disaster.\u201dThe commodities trading commission filed civil fraud charges against Mr. Baker and Lake Shore. A federal judge, persuaded that Mr. Baker was on the run and hiding evidence, referred the case to the local United States attorney\u2019s office for criminal investigation.F.B.I. agents interviewed Mr. Baker\u2019s Lake Shore colleagues. Mr. Kurgan told them that he had no formal role with Lake Shore and was only its outside broker, an F.B.I. summary of the interview shows.By the F.B.I.\u2019s tally, Lake Shore\u2019s roughly 700 clients had lost more than $300 million. Investigators believed that Mr. Baker and others at the firm had siphoned off at least $11 million for their personal use.In February 2009, a grand jury returned a sealed, 27-count indictment accusing Mr. Baker of fraud, embezzlement and obstruction of justice. His colleagues were not charged.That month, Mr. Baker married Ms. Malychenko in a civil ceremony in Hamburg, where the two were living. He said he did not know that he had been indicted, or even that he was a wanted man. With Lake Shore dead, he said, he was trying to focus on the future. \u201cGod had a different plan, and I moved on,\u201d he said.Within a few weeks \u2014 and just days after Mr. Baker and Ms. Malychenko celebrated their nuptials with a black-tie party at a Hamburg yacht club \u2014 a pair of plainclothes German police officers appeared at Mr. Baker\u2019s door. They escorted him to their car. His new wife blew him a kiss.Mr. Baker was held in a prison near the Hamburg airport. One day, an official from the Canadian Embassy came to visit with a brochure explaining Mr. Baker\u2019s rights as a Canadian citizen. One right he learned about: If he were convicted in the United States, he would be entitled under an international treaty to apply to be transferred to Canada to serve his sentence.\u201cThat\u2019s when I started thinking about how to pull this off,\u201d he said.In December 2009, after Mr. Baker had spent five months in a German jail, United States marshals flew him to Chicago, where he was booked into the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Months passed as he awaited a trial date, and Mr. Baker learned the prison\u2019s rhythms. The most important thing, he said, was to convince other inmates that he was not a child molester. He told them he was a Wall Street crook.Clifford C. Histed, the lead prosecutor on the case, summoned Mr. Baker to discuss the report. Mr. Baker argued that it proved he did not deserve to be punished alone. And he said the commodities trading commission was making Lake Shore a scapegoat, flexing its enforcement muscles after failing to prevent other hedge funds from blowing up.Mr. Histed told him to provide proof.Mr. Baker, using a computer in the prison library, spent months sifting through electronic documents before presenting his case to Mr. Histed.The prosecutor did not agree that Mr. Baker was the victim of a government conspiracy. But in Mr. Baker\u2019s final plea agreement, prosecutors said Mr. Baker did have a partner, described as \u201cIndividual A,\u201d who had misrepresented Lake Shore\u2019s returns and misappropriated money. \u201cIndividual A\u201d refers to Mr. Kurgan, according to a person involved in the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly about the plea document.Mr. Baker and his lawyer, Daniel L. Rashbaum, a former prosecutor, were running out of legal options. Then Mr. Baker remembered the Canadian treaty he had learned about in Germany.Starting in the late 1970s, the United States had entered into a series of treaties that established protocols for cross-border prisoner transfers. One catalyst was the nonfiction book \u201cMidnight Express,\u201d the basis of a 1978 movie, about a young American imprisoned in Turkey.That gave Mr. Rashbaum an idea. If he could get the United States attorney\u2019s office to support a transfer to Canada, perhaps Justice Department officials in Washington would go along with it. And the Canadians, Mr. Rashbaum recalled thinking, were likely to let Mr. Baker out quickly. In that case, the length of his sentence in America wouldn\u2019t matter.Mr. Rashbaum approached Mr. Histed with a proposal: Mr. Baker would admit guilt and accept a 20-year prison sentence, with no chance for parole, if the prosecutors did not object to him being transferred to Canada.Mr. Histed said in an interview that he knew the defense hoped the maneuver would result in Mr. Baker\u2019s freedom, but he doubted it would work. And more important, he knew that going to trial would be time-consuming and risky for the government, in part because Mr. Baker could raise questions in front of a jury about why he alone was on trial.So Mr. Histed agreed to the deal. \u201cWhat mattered to us was that he be brought to justice in the United States,\u201d he said in an interview.On Aug. 24, 2011, Mr. Baker was presented a plea agreement to sign. He was nervous; his lawyer was terrified. \u201cThe horror of pleading someone to 20 years based on a creative plan scared the living daylights out of me,\u201d Mr. Rashbaum said.Mr. Baker took a deep breath and signed the document. Mr. Rashbaum walked out to the parking lot and vomited.Before Mr. Baker left Chicago to begin serving his sentence, he received a bill from the Justice Department for $154,831,682.32 in restitution. \u201cWe strongly urge you to pay this debt immediately,\u201d the bill said. He also received divorce papers from his wife.Three months later, Mr. Baker stood in the mail-call line and opened the letter that would change his life. \u201cThe United States has approved the request for transfer to Canada of the above-named Canadian national,\u201d it read.Mr. Baker felt dizzy. He scanned the letter again to make sure he had not misread it. Then he walked back to his cell. \u201cI think God really stepped in,\u201d he said.He had been imprisoned for about three years \u2014 five months in Germany, two years in Chicago and seven months at Fort Dix \u2014 after being convicted of a single count of fraud. As a result, he would probably be eligible for parole in Canada.Mr. Histed, the prosecutor, said the speed of the decision surprised him. \u201cIf we knew he would immediately have been approved for a transfer, would that have changed our stance?\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps.\u201dMr. Baker\u2019s transfer to Canada still needed the approval of the authorities there.Vic Toews, the minister for public safety at that time, believed that such transfers posed public-safety risks. He wrote that, because he had lived in Germany, Mr. Baker intended \u201cto abandon Canada as his place of permanent residence.\u201d The application was rejected.\u201cI always thought the hitch would be with the U.S. government, not the Canadians,\u201d Mr. Baker said. He had convinced himself that freedom was imminent. Now he was marooned in New Jersey.Coming to terms with the prospect of spending years in prison, he started to teach yoga. He dispensed investing advice to guards. He got a landscaping job on the prison grounds. His monthly pay was $18, a few dollars of which were earmarked to pay down his $155 million debt.And he began writing about his experience. Not knowing how his tale would end, he finished with a fictional scene in which he was reunited with his father on the shore of a lake where he had sailed as a boy.Then, after Mr. Baker had spent nearly six years incarcerated in America, Canada elected a new government, and Mr. Baker sensed an opportunity. Perhaps the new administration would have a more positive attitude about prisoner transfers.He reapplied. And this time, it worked.On May 10, 2016, another letter arrived, this one from Ottawa. Canada\u2019s public safety minister, it said, \u201chas approved your transfer to Canada.\u201dLast fall, Mr. Baker rode a bus across the Canadian border to a minimum-security prison. He could cook for himself, and go fishing. Two months later, his case manager called him to ask: \u201cDo you want to go home?\u201dIt was his mother\u2019s birthday. The prison gave him a winter jacket and a bus ticket to Toronto. On the bus, Mr. Baker borrowed a passenger\u2019s cellphone and called his father.\u201cI\u2019m on a bus!\u201d he exclaimed.\u201cI started to cry,\u201d his father, William Baker, recalled.The elder Mr. Baker told his wife that he was taking her to dinner. The place, he said, was a surprise. Instead, he drove to a shopping mall northeast of Toronto. Their son was standing outside an Old Navy store.Mr. Baker\u2019s release was not announced. His former colleagues, his first wife, the Lake Shore clients who lost money \u2014 no one knew he was out.\u201cI\u2019m sorry he\u2019s out of jail, because that\u2019s where he belongs,\u201d said Mr. Rosenberg, the former Lake Shore director. \u201cHe screwed so many people.\u201dMr. Baker moved back into his parents\u2019 basement. He set up a small office with some accouterments \u2014 a golden pen case, a picture of a yacht \u2014 from his Lake Shore days. He interviewed for a job as a financial consultant. He contemplated turning his prison writings into a book.That was when he discovered he had miscalculated. In prison, he had imagined that if he got to Canada, the authorities in the United States would not pursue him for the $155 million he owed.But this summer, a lawyer whom he had consulted about a book deal broke the news: The receiver in the Lake Shore bankruptcy could chase him and any money he made, through Canada\u2019s civil courts.So Mr. Baker is free. But he has no prospect of escaping the shadow of his former life.\u201cI\u2019m screwed,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Could Sell Trump the Brooklyn Bridge", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is a saying \u2014 \u201cWhen you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, any road will get you there\u201d \u2014 and it perfectly sums up the contrast between China\u2019s President Xi Jinping and President Trump.Xi has been brilliant at playing Trump, plying him with flattery and short-term trade concessions and deflecting him from the real structural trade imbalances with China. All along, Xi keeps his eye on the long-term prize of making China great again. Trump, meanwhile, touts every minor victory as historic and proceeds down any road that will give him a quick sugar high.Trump literally has no idea what he\u2019s doing and has no integrated strategy \u2014 because, unlike Xi, Trump\u2019s given no thought to the big questions every effective leader starts his day with: \u201cWhat world am I living in? What are the biggest trends in this world? And how do I align my country so more of my citizens get the most out of these trends and cushion the worst?\u201dWhat world are we in? One in which we\u2019re going through three \u201cclimate changes\u201d at once.We\u2019re going through a change in the actual climate: Destructive weather events and the degradation of ecosystems are steadily accelerating.We\u2019re going through a change in the \u201cclimate\u201d of globalization: from an interconnected world to an interdependent one; from a world of walls, where you build your wealth by hoarding resources, to a world of webs, where you thrive by connecting your citizens to the most flows of ideas, trade, innovation and education.And, finally, we\u2019re going through a change in the \u201cclimate\u201d of technology and work: Machines are acquiring all five senses, and with big data and artificial intelligence, every company can now analyze, optimize, prophesize, customize, digitize and automatize more and more jobs, products and services. And those companies that don\u2019t will wither.So how\u2019s China responding? To deal with the change in the climate, it\u2019s massively investing in clean power and electric vehicles \u2014 because its own people won\u2019t be able to breathe otherwise and because it knows that in a world that will add another one billion people by around 2030, clean power and transportation and energy efficiency will be the next great global industry, or nobody anywhere will breathe.In response to a more interdependent world, China is deepening its trade ties to all the fast-growing Asian markets around it through its \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d project and its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, while tightly controlling its own market. I call it \u201cglobalization for me but not for you.\u201dBecause while China hails globalization, it imposes a 25 percent tariff on imported cars (while America imposes only 2.5 percent) and 50-50 joint ventures and technology transfers for big companies that want to gain access to China\u2019s giant market. But China gets away with it.In technology, China has embarked on a plan called \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d that\u2019s plowing government funds and research into commercializing 10 strategic industries while creating regulations and swiping intellectual property from abroad to make them all grow faster. These industries include electric vehicles, new materials, artificial intelligence, integrated circuits, biopharmacy, quantum computing, 5G mobile communications, and robotics.And Trump? On the change in the climate, he\u2019s promoting coal over clean energy, like wind and solar, and has appointed climate-change deniers to all of his key environmental posts. While China is run by engineers, Trump doesn\u2019t even have a science adviser. He\u2019s refused to fill the White House Office of Science and Technology, which, as Newsweek reported, \u201chas been without a boss for the longest stretch since its establishment in 1976.\u201dOn globalization, Trump tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal, which would have put him at the helm of a 12-nation Pacific trading bloc (without China), built on U.S. interests and values, and would have eliminated as many as 18,000 tariffs on U.S. exports to countries that, together with the U.S., control 40 percent of global G.D.P. And then he went to China and praised Beijing for beating us at our own game! Well, Donald, when you unilaterally disarm, that tends to happen.By the way, the 11 other TPP nations are now trying to create their own free-trade zone \u2014 without the U.S. So after decades of America trying to push all their markets open, they\u2019re going to open without us. Nice going, Mr. President, China thanks you, because these countries will be much more vulnerable to Chinese economic pressure with our presence diminished.On the change of the climate of technology, Trump is pushing a tax bill that is based on no analysis of emerging technologies and how we might reform our tax laws to incentivize more investment in them. Actually, the bill would eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric cars; shrink the tax credits vital for enabling wind projects; and impose a tax on the endowments of our wealthiest colleges \u2014 i.e., our science and engineering treasures \u2014 endowments that colleges use to fund research and extend scholarships for the neediest students.\u201cThis will be wounding to one of America\u2019s gems,\u201d its institutions of higher education, Drew Faust, the president of Harvard, said to me. And it\u2019s basically being done to cut taxes for the wealthy.Moreover, at a time when China\u2019s roads and rails increasingly look like the Jetsons\u2019 and ours increasingly look like the Flintstones\u2019, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials complained in a Nov. 9 letter to House leaders that their draft tax bill \u2014 in order to raise more money for corporate tax cuts \u2014 \u201cmakes significant changes to some of the federally supported financing mechanisms used for transportation\u201d \u2014 specifically the \u201cproposed termination of tax-exempt private activity bonds (PABs),\u201d which serve \u201cas an important infrastructure financing tool that attracts private sector investment to \u2026 large transportation projects across the country.\u201dSo the Chinese are focused on the giant winds of change, and Trump is betting on his gut and a grab bag of tax cuts based on no take on the world, other than dubious trickle-down economics. No surprise. When you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going any tax cut will get you there, any replacement for Obamacare will get you there, any wall will get you there, any trade concession will get you there.But China, with its ability to focus, is getting 90 percent out of its inferior system, and it has brought China a long way fast. And we, with too little focus, are getting 50 percent out of our superior system.

{"Headline": "Senate Plan Could Increase Taxes on Some Middle-Class Workers", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, acknowledged on Friday that the Republican tax plan might result in a tax hike for some working Americans, saying he \u201cmisspoke\u201d days earlier when he said that \u201cnobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase\u201d under the Senate bill.\u201cI misspoke on that,\u201d Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said in an interview on Friday with The New York Times. \u201cYou can\u2019t guarantee that absolutely no one sees a tax increase, but what we are doing is targeting levels of income and looking at the average in those levels and the average will be tax relief for the average taxpayer in each of those segments.\u201dThe Senate bill unveiled on Thursday would raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, according to a preliminary New York Times analysis. The plan would also disproportionately benefit high earners and corporations. Still, middle-class earners would fare better under the Senate proposal than its counterpart in the House, the analysis found.The Senate Finance Committee bill would, on average, cut taxes for people at every income level. But, as Mr. McConnell alluded to in his revised remarks, those benefits would vary widely within income brackets, depending on the specific circumstances of individuals and households, and many would pay more than under existing rules.Republican lawmakers have been in a dash to devise \u2014 and pass \u2014 a tax overhaul that would mark their most significant achievement since taking control of Congress. President Trump and Republican leaders have outlined two main objectives for the rewrite: cutting taxes for American businesses and for the middle class. The legislation reduces tax rates on individuals and businesses, while eliminating some tax breaks to make up for lost revenues. It is meant to accelerate economic growth and increase wages for workers.Both the House and Senate bills would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and provide business tax benefits, such as the ability to immediately expense purchases of equipment.The Times analysis, using the open-source software TaxBrain, found that roughly one-quarter of families in the middle class would see their taxes increase in 2018, by about $1,000 on average. By 2026, the share seeing an increase would rise slightly, to about one-third, and the average increase would rise to about $1,600. For the majority of middle-class families that receive a tax cut, the average savings would be about $1,300 in 2018 and $1,700 in 2026.The Times analysis defines the middle class broadly as those earning between two-thirds and twice the median household income, or about $50,000 to $160,000 per year for a family of three. To focus on families, the analysis excluded individual filers and households headed by people 65 or older and is adjusted for the size of each household.Under the House bill, The Times has found, about half of middle-class families would pay more in taxes in 2026.The analysis did not seek to calculate how workers might benefit from a steep cut in the corporate tax rate, which both the Senate and House bills would reduce to 20 percent from a top rate of 35 percent today, or project how the bills might increase economic growth and, with it, Americans\u2019 wages.For taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year, the Senate bill offers a more limited upside and downside than the House bill.The Senate bill is less likely than the House bill to yield tax increases for high-income Americans, in part because it cuts the top marginal personal tax rate, while the House bill creates a so-called \u201cbubble rate\u201d that would actually raise taxes on many high-salaried workers.The Senate measure would also produce a smaller average tax windfall for high earners than the House version, in part by offering less generous benefits for owners of businesses known as pass-throughs, which are not organized as corporations.Under the Senate plan, \u201cAmericans are especially likely to face a tax increase if they have a smaller family, have mostly wage income instead of investment income, or claim some of the many deductions that the bill repeals, like those for state and local taxes and employee business expenses,\u201d said Lily Batchelder, a professor and tax specialist at New York University Law School, who worked on economic policy in the Obama administration. \u201cThey are increasing taxes on many in the middle class, while concentrating their tax cuts on the wealthy.\u201dThe Senate bill appears much better for the very wealthy than it is for the somewhat wealthy. About half of families earning between two and three times the median income \u2014 or about $160,000 to $240,000 for a family of three \u2014 would pay more in 2018 than under existing law. But among the richest families, those earning more than about $500,000 for a family of three, nearly 90 percent would get a tax cut.The findings come with an important caveat: The Senate bill, as written, appears unable to muster the 60 votes needed to avoid a Democratic filibuster, meaning Republicans will need to amend it to comply with the budget reconciliation rules and allow permit passage by a simple majority. Those changes could likely include putting expiration dates on some of the bill\u2019s major provisions, which could make the final version of the bill look less favorable to the middle class, particularly in later years.The Times\u2019s figures are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data using a tax model from the Open Source Policy Center, a Washington research organization affiliated with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Because the analysis is based on publicly available data, not actual tax records, it may not capture all the intricacies of Americans\u2019 household finances.The Senate bill differs sharply from the House version in its approach to cutting taxes on businesses. But when it comes to taxes on individuals and families, the bills are more similar than different. Both would double the standard deduction while eliminating a raft of deductions and credits. Both would make the child tax credit more generous. Both would restructure federal income tax brackets to impose lower marginal tax rates at most income levels, although the Senate approach, unlike the House version, doesn\u2019t eliminate two brackets entirely.The Senate bill includes features that would make its plan more favorable to the middle class. It preserves some popular tax deductions and credits that the House bill initially would have eliminated, and it makes the child tax credit somewhat more generous and widely available. On the other hand, the Senate bill, unlike the House version, would eliminate the deduction for property taxes, which could lead to higher federal taxes for homeowners in areas with high property tax rates or expensive housing markets.Aparna Mathur, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said senators could improve the bill with further changes, such as expanding the earned-income tax credit and extending the benefits of the child tax credit to more low-income taxpayers. \u201cWe clearly need to do more to help the lowest-income families,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, we can engage in more base broadening for the highest-income households, perhaps by eliminating and not just capping the mortgage-interest deduction.\u201dThe Times analysis found that roughly one-fifth of the Senate bill\u2019s cuts in 2018 would go to families and individuals earning $1 million or more, and close to half would go to people earning at least $200,000. Between 10 million and 15 million taxpayers earning less than $100,000 a year would pay more than under existing law.Families earning more than $1 million a year would see their after-tax income rise by about 1.7 percent in 2018 compared with what they would make under current law, nearly triple the gains enjoyed by those earning less than $200,000.Over all, the Senate bill would cut individual income taxes by about $30 billion in 2018, and by $900 billion over the next decade, according to Congress\u2019s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. And most people in all income groups would see a tax cut, although the cuts would be modest for most lower earners.Jim Tankersley reported from Washington, and Ben Casselman from New York.

{"Headline": "Perth Amboy, N.J.: Historic Buildings and Affordable Housing", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving In11 PhotosShortly into the new millennium, the future looked hopeful for Perth Amboy, N.J., a city on Raritan Bay a skipping stone\u2019s throw from Staten Island. As part of a larger revitalization plan, the town\u2019s mayor at the time, Joseph Vas, promised a $600 million development at the water\u2019s edge, with 2,200 housing units, shops, a hotel and high-speed ferry service to New York.But then the economy tanked. The developer, Kushner Companies, constructed only two buildings, with fewer than 200 housing units altogether. And the mayor, Mr. Vas, was convicted on unrelated corruption charges.Then came Hurricane Sandy.Caroline Pozycki-Torres, the founder of a nonprofit that organizes local cultural events, moved to Perth Amboy in 2006, and in 2010 paid $250,000 for a 1,700-square-foot condominium in an 1890 house on Water Street, near the bay. A former chair of the municipal arts council, she has introduced to the city a waterfront arts festival, moonrise concerts, a pop-up cinema and a public mural project.Ms. Pozycki-Torres described her life among sailboats and sea breezes as a rare gift. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in nonprofits all my life, and my husband is a musician,\u201d she said, noting that Perth Amboy is attracting an increasing number of artists.Also well situated is Alan Silber. In 1987, he and his wife, Sonia, paid $135,000 for an 82-year-old, three-bedroom house on Rector Street near the waterfront, which he said is worth about $220,000 today. But Mr. Silber, a retired distribution manager, emphasized that the area, with its endearing Victorian houses, is only one part of the town, and in some ways its own country.\u201cThis is how we sell Perth Amboy,\u201d he said of the neighborhood, which slopes up from the bay and has a recently renovated park that hosts Sunday concerts in summer, which is sure to appeal to prospective buyers from the city. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t Perth Amboy.\u201dHe and many of his neighbors rarely shop in the commercial area along Smith Street several blocks away, he said, preferring to drive to nearby malls.But Barry Rosengarten, a developer who chairs Perth Amboy\u2019s business improvement district, said the downtown is due for at least one large upgrade: New Jersey Transit has allocated funds for a $50 million redevelopment of the 1920s train station there, he noted.Such measures would help Perth Amboy join many other New Jersey cities in developing housing around transportation hubs. In support of this direction, Mayor Wilda Diaz\u2019s office recently presented a plan to commercialize several blocks of Front Street near the water and raise the heights of downtown buildings.William Petrick, the City Council president, said the plan may not sufficiently address problems with aging infrastructure, including a neglected water supply and sewer system. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be a Debbie Downer,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have some great history, and we need to focus on marketing that.\u201dPerth Amboy was first incorporated in 1683. It has wonderful historic buildings in various states of repair. Its city hall, part of which dates to 1714, is the oldest continuously operating municipal building in the United States. The last British royal governor\u2019s palace in existence is on Kearny Avenue \u2014 a building called Proprietary House, where Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Loyalist son, William, briefly lived before his arrest by militiamen.Perth Amboy also has a long post-colonial history of immigration, as conveyed by a neighborhood called Budapest and another formerly known as Dublin. About 80 percent of the town\u2019s 52,000 residents are Latino, including the mayor, whose parents were born in Puerto Rico.David Caba, a local real estate agent, said buyers from New York are attracted not only to the single-family Victorians on the historic waterfront, but also the midcentury ranch homes in Spa Springs, a neighborhood with easy access to the Outerbridge Crossing to Staten Island. The nest of highways cutting through the city also includes the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway.Multifamily homes are more common in the center of Perth Amboy, Mr. Caba said, and are frequently bought by outside investors who rent them.Harbortown, a townhouse development below Route 440 that is expanding east toward the water, has a mix of condominiums and rental units; eventually there will be 1,800 units in all.Enrique Hernandez, founder of Petra Best Realty in Perth Amboy, said the housing market has picked up in the last two years because of continuing low interest rates and an infusion of buyers who have repaired bad credit and can now obtain financing. Demand has driven down inventory, so that only about 60 single-family houses were on the market as of November, compared with double that number two years ago, he said. And the supply of multifamily homes sharply decreased as well during the same period, from about 65 to 12.According to the real estate website Trulia, from May 24 to Aug. 23, the median sales price for homes in Perth Amboy was $210,625, based on 60 transactions, a year-on-year increase of 3 percent.Mr. Hernandez also noted a strong rental market. Monthly rents range from about $1,000 a month for a one-bedroom unit in a downtown building with a business on the lower floor to $2,600 for a three-bedroom townhouse in what he described as a \u201cgood area.\u201dStanding at the shore, looking north over rippling water to the bridge to Staten Island and the garden of giant white petroleum tanks next to it, one is reminded that nature, historic pedigree and heavy industry make strange bedfellows in a town. Ms. Pozycki-Torres may have summed up Perth Amboy\u2019s jagged edges best when she described her life there as \u201cvery chill, but also very intense.\u201dAmong Perth Amboy\u2019s five elementary schools, Robert N. Wilentz, founded in 2000 to help ease overcrowding, enrolls about 960 students in kindergarten through fourth grade. On 2015-16 state tests, 36 percent met standards in English compared with 57 percent districtwide; 34 percent met standards in math versus 71 districtwide.One of two middle schools, William C. McGinnis enrolls 1,522 students in fifth through eighth grades. On state tests, 31 percent of students met standards in English versus 29 percent districtwide; 17 percent met standards in math versus 14 districtwide.Perth Amboy High School serves about 2,500 students in ninth through 12th grades. Mean 2016 SAT scores were 434 for reading/writing and 448 for math, versus 537 and 538 statewide.As the town\u2019s student population continues to swell, a new high school is planned on Convery Boulevard. And ground was broken last month on Seaman Avenue for a 128,000-square-foot elementary school that is scheduled to open in the fall of 2019.New Jersey Transit\u2019s North Jersey Coast line offers frequent train service from Perth Amboy to Pennsylvania Station. Rush hour trip times range from about 45 minutes to an hour and cost $12.25 each way, or $353 for a monthly pass. A bus operated by New Jersey Transit travels from Perth Amboy Station to Port Authority in about an hour and costs $10.75 each way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Empty Rail Cars Roll Into the Adirondacks, Stirring Controversy", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMINERVA, N.Y. \u2014 The Hudson River is a small stream as it courses through pristine forests in the Adirondacks in northern New York, not far from its source on Mount Marcy, the state\u2019s highest peak.During World War II, the federal government built a 30-mile long railroad that sliced through this verdant patch, stretching from North Creek to Tahawus, a remote village about 125 miles north of Albany.State officials opposed the railroad at the time because of its intrusion on the Adirondack Forest Preserve.But the war effort superseded environmental concerns and the tracks were laid. The railroad was needed to carry ilmenite, a mineral used to make titanium for armored vehicles, from mines in Tahawus.Today, a new battle is raging over plans to store up to 3,000 empty rail cars on the tracks, which were reopened five years ago after nearly a quarter century of remaining idle. More than 80 cars, some of which had been used to transport oil, began arriving a few weeks ago from the Midwest, to the consternation of environmental groups backed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.\u201cIt is unsightly,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Cuomo told reporters recently in Glens Falls. \u201cIt is out of character with the Adirondacks. Nobody goes to the Adirondacks to look at old trains. They go there to look at the natural beauty.\u2019\u2019Iowa Pacific Holdings, a rail company based in Chicago, bought the rail line with plans to haul rocks from abandoned mines that could be used for large-scale construction projects such as building roads. So far, however, the firm has not found a market for the venture.Instead, Iowa Pacific has begun leasing rail space, about 100 cars per track mile, to rail companies that want to store cars that are not needed.Ed Ellis, the president of Iowa Pacific, said leasing space raises money needed for track maintenance and repairs.In addition to the old mining rail line, Iowa Pacific also operates a connecting railroad, the Saratoga and North Creek Railway, which runs 60 miles from Saratoga Springs to North Creek, home of the Gore Mountain ski resort. It began operating the railway, which is used primarily for sightseeing rides, in 2011 under a lease agreement with Warren County and the town of Corinth, which own the tracks on the scenic railroad.Iowa Pacific, however, is responsible for maintaining the tracks from Saratoga to Tahawus, which Mr. Ellis said costs more than $750,000 per year. Leasing storage space on the tracks, Mr. Ellis said, is a way to generate revenue to allow the company to run the scenic railway while it continues to seek customers for the rocks from the mines.\u201cWe\u2019re patient investors,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not about quarterly earnings. This is about the long-term future of railroads.\u201dBut critics suspect that the storage deal will prove anything but temporary and oppose parking the rail cars for aesthetic reasons and also over concerns that the cars could damage the environment if they start deteriorating.\u201cIn essence, Iowa Pacific is trying to build this linear junkyard through the Adirondack Park,\u201d said Peter Bauer, the executive director of Protect the Adirondacks, an environmental group. \u201cIt appears that Iowa Pacific will continue to bring in more oil tanker cars until the state steps in and halts this activity.\u201dMr. Ellis said that all the rail cars had been inspected and thoroughly cleaned by their owners.The state Department of Environmental Conservation and the Adirondack Park Agency, another state entity that regulates land use in the park, also oppose the storage arrangement. \u201cWe are seriously concerned about potential environmental impacts and are evaluating all legal and regulatory options at our disposal,\u2019\u2019 the agencies said in a joint statement.But so far no action has been taken.Most of the mining rail line crosses through Essex County, which borders Warren to the north. \u201cThe Adirondacks are beautiful and we want to keep it that way,\u201d said Stephen R. McNally, the supervisor of the town of Minerva, which is in Essex.Warren County officials say they are disappointed by the performance of the sightseeing railroad, which they say has not lived up to promises by Iowa Pacific that it would boost the local economy.Iowa Pacific was supposed \u201cto support economic development and business activity that creates jobs in our area,\u2019\u2019 said Ronald F. Conover, the chairman of the Warren County board of supervisors. \u201cStoring rail cars doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dNot everyone, however, is against the storage of rail cars.\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope,\u201d said Thomas R. Scozzafava, the supervisor of the town of Moriah in Essex County. \u201cWhere does it stop? It\u2019s like trying to tell a grocery store, we don\u2019t like the shopping carts out front. What about car dealerships and marinas? Are we going to tell them they can\u2019t store cars and boats? It\u2019s a railroad, that\u2019s what you do.\u201dMr. Ellis downplayed the argument that the line of parked rail cars are unsightly, noting that they are over two miles from the nearest road. \u201cThe cars are really out of sight, out in the middle of nowhere, in a place that\u2019s seldom seen,\u201d he said.Mr. Bauer is among a number of environmentalists who would prefer that the railroad tracks be torn up and turned into a recreational trail, something that has been done across the country in places where tracks have been largely abandoned or barely used.For now, though, empty rail cars continue to arrive in the forest with more to come, a consequence in part of the rising global supply of oil for which there are no customers.Iowa Pacific says it is simply trying to take advantage of what is happening in the oil market to finance its business.\u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity to make money,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Ellis said, \u201cyou make money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Truck Attack Casts Cloak of Terrorism on Final Mayoral Debate", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAgainst a backdrop of renewed fears of terrorism, Mayor Bill de Blasio and two of his main challengers clashed on Wednesday in their final pre-election debate that, after a solemn start, descended into frequent cross-talk and pointed attacks.Neither challenger criticized the mayor on his handling of the attack; each started by praising the Police Department and the resolve of the people of the city. All three liked the idea of more bollards.But Mr. Dietl defended the surveillance of Muslims within minutes of the start.\u201cAs far as this profiling thing, worrying about it, just look at this terrorist,\u201d Mr. Dietl said. \u201cWhat did he look like?

(Reporters were barred from entering the audience area.)Mr. Dietl, who yelled through much of the first debate, softened his tone on Wednesday night, but not his message.\u201cI know a criminal when I see one. Mr. Mayor, you\u2019re a criminal with your corruption and your pay-for-play,\u201d Mr. Dietl said.Ms. Malliotakis, 36, who represents areas of Staten Island and southwestern Brooklyn, sparred with Mr. de Blasio, amid frequent cross-talk with Mr. Dietl.The most sustained back-and-forth came on the subject of rising property tax bills that some areas of the city have experienced. She pointed out that, in contrast, homeowners in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where Mr. de Blasio owns two townhouses worth more than $1 million, pay relatively little in property taxes.\u201cLike so many New Yorkers, I bought my home a long time ago and I never thought we\u2019d see the kind of values we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.\u201cYou\u2019re a millionaire!\u201d Mr. Dietl interjected in mock awe.Mr. de Blasio then shifted to criticize Ms. Malliotakis for not supporting his call for a so-called millionaires tax to pay for transit system improvements, and he pointed out that she voted for Mr. Trump.\u201cO.K., here we go,\u201d Ms. Malliotakis said. \u201cHere we go again.\u201d\u201cSo let me hear you say out loud you support a millionaires tax,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.\u201cI support you, Millionaire Bill, paying more property taxes,\u201d Ms. Malliotakis shot back.But the Republican candidate struggled to rise above the din with anything like a clear articulation of what the city would look like under her leadership.\u201cOn January 1st, the for-sale sign comes off the gates of City Hall,\u201d she said, in closing.At the end of the debate, Mr. Dietl praised Mr. DuBois, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re the best narrator.\u201dMr. de Blasio could not resist correcting him. \u201cModerator,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Donald Trump Save Roy Moore After All?", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionDAPHNE, Ala. \u2014 Election season is always a tense time in Alabama, still shadowed as we are by George Wallace\u2019s \u201csegregation forever\u201d antics and the dread among educated voters that our latest political star will humiliate the state yet again in the eyes of the nation.Coming on the heels of Republican losses in Virginia on Tuesday, the Dec. 12 election in Alabama, which prides itself as a spiritual heartland of the Trump revolution, will be closely watched as a critical test of Mr. Trump\u2019s political vitality. Even before the Moore allegations surfaced, his race against the Democratic nominee, Doug Jones, a celebrated prosecutor of Klan bombers, presented a potentially historic breach in Alabama\u2019s long record of electing the candidate best known for radical showmanship.I decided to head to my home state to watch this race when Mr. Moore, a former state Supreme Court judge, won the Republican nomination in September over Luther Strange, a lumbering former state attorney general known as Big Luther who was endorsed by Mr. Trump and financed by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Mr. Moore is a fundamentalist Christian who channels Reaganesque cowboy imagery and rides a horse named Sassy to his polling place. He crushed the charisma-challenged Mr. Strange, stunning elite Republicans, whose party is being consumed by class warfare between suburbanites and the rural white evangelicals who make up Mr. Trump\u2019s base.Born in Birmingham in 1943, I found the contest an irresistible collision between national forces and Alabama\u2019s political tradition. Elections here are performance art, with victory the reward for eye-catching clowns like Yancey, Cotton Tom Heflin in the 1920s, Jim Folsom in the 1940s and 1950s, Wallace in the 1960s, and now Mr. Moore.The tradition of rebelling against progress has left Alabama as the only state of the Old Confederacy never to have elected a senator or governor untainted by scandal who was willing to embrace modern attitudes on race, social justice and economic fairness. As I sat in the Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church in Daphne recently, I wondered if Mr. Jones, a steelworker\u2019s son, could become the first campaigner to confront Alabamians\u2019 mind-set of grievance.\u201cWe started in Alabama on the wrong side of history,\u201d Mr. Jones said at the church. \u201cLet\u2019s not let those ghosts define us.\u201d A day earlier, he had said: \u201cRoy Moore represents a backward look. I\u2019m tired of Alabama being an embarrassment around the country.\u201dTo my knowledge no other candidate had addressed the Alabama inferiority complex so directly as Mr. Jones, with the exception of Wallace, arguing in the opposite direction. In 1963, Wallace had journeyed to Harvard to assure an incredulous student audience that Alabama had \u201cgood race relations.\u201d In that same speech, he blamed immoral Yankee soldiers for the presence of light-skinned black people in Alabama.Bob Zellner can attest firsthand to Wallace\u2019s absurdities at Harvard\u2019s Memorial Hall. Mr. Zellner, son of an Alabama Klansman, joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in 1961 and became its first white field secretary. At the Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church, Mr. Jones praised him from the pulpit as one of Alabama\u2019s civil rights heroes. Over 50 years ago, an astonished Wallace had singled him out from the lectern at Harvard, having discovered that the Alabama rebel had followed him north. \u201cOh, I know you,\u201d Wallace said, labeling Mr. Zellner a troublemaking jailbird for the question he put to Wallace about Alabama\u2019s police brutality and murders of civil rights workers.\u201cAlabama has always had a victim\u2019s complex,\u201d Mr. Zellner told me in an email. \u201cWallace was always \u2018sending a message\u2019 to the elite, pointy-headed rich people but he ended up turning one group of little people against other little people while helping the rich get richer. The worst available candidate, the most radical, would always get the most attention, the highest ratings.\u201dI had never met Mr. Zellner until I sought him out in Daphne. There we were, two native sons of the Heart of Dixie, bound by hope as part of a standing-room-only crowd that Mr. Jones said represented \u201ca shining Alabama the way it was always supposed to be.\u201d The audience was about equally composed of black and white, young and old. How many of those whites were crossover Republicans? That\u2019s the question that will determine whether Alabama sends its first truly New South figure to Washington.Like the national Republican Party, Alabama\u2019s microcosmic version of Trump World was split along class lines. Even before the allegations about Mr. Moore\u2019s predatory sexual history dropped, Mr. Jones seemed to be whittling Mr. Moore\u2019s double-digit lead by assuring upper-class Republicans that their Confederate ancestors would recognize the \u201chonor in compromise and civility.\u201d His has been the most vigorous Democratic campaign in decades and, perhaps prophetically for Mr. Trump, the wealthiest Republican enclaves like Mountain Brook near Birmingham and Fairhope on Mobile Bay are covered with Jones lawn signs. Less affluent suburbs with highly educated professionals, like Vestavia Hills and Hoover near Birmingham, follow the pattern.I asked two prominent Fairhope residents about how their wealthy peers would vote. One, a liberal, said his neighbors on Mobile Bay\u2019s fashionable Eastern Shore would claim to support Mr. Jones and then secretly vote for Mr. Moore, a man they would not invite to their homes.Another, a conservative, said \u201cmost of my Republican friends say they are going to vote for Jones\u201d because Mr. Moore would shame the state. As to how local Republicans will finally split, he predicted half would vote for Mr. Jones and half might stay home. \u201cThat would be all right, too,\u201d Mr. Jones told me later when I described the conversation.But things will be more complicated now that Mr. Moore has been wounded. Republican leaders in rural counties are urging voters to ignore allegations from nearly 40 years ago that don\u2019t involve forcible rape. Alabama\u2019s eccentric state auditor, Jim Zeigler, is even assuring evangelicals that they can stick with Mr. Moore in good faith because many women in the Bible, including Mary, the mother of Jesus, were married to older men.So the Alabama Republican Party is on the horns of another dilemma. Republican leaders in the Washington swamp are telling them to dump Mr. Moore. Local Trump supporters are telling them to ignore \u201cfake news\u201d and stand up for Alabama. Mr. Strange is lurking in the wings, feeding speculation that he could save his party\u2019s respectability from Mr. Moore and Steve Bannon as a write-in candidate. But a split between Moore loyalists and Strange write-ins would hand the election to Mr. Jones, something that Mr. Trump can ill afford after the roughing up he took on Tuesday.For the next month, Mr. Moore\u2019s disappearing inevitability, Mr. Jones\u2019s hope-based insurgency and the strain between have and have-not Republicans will be debated every day in the state\u2019s meat-and-three restaurants. Mr. Trump, given his own baggage and the freewheeling defiance of Alabama voters, would do well to watch cautiously. Mr. Zellner and I can attest that political theater can be tricky here. Alabama voters don\u2019t mind being in the spotlight, no matter how bad it makes them look. They have that in common with the president.Howell Raines is a former executive editor of The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forget Trump and Discover the World", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMumbai, INDIA \u2014 In a recent MSNBC interview I described President Trump as a \u201cbrain-eating disease.\u201dI did so because his indecent behavior, and nonstop outrageous tweets and actions, force you as a commentator into a terrible choice: either ignore it all and risk normalizing Trump\u2019s excesses or write about him constantly and risk not having the time to learn and report about the big trends now reshaping the world \u2014 trends that one day will surprise your readers and leave them asking, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know this?\u201dTo inoculate myself against Trump eating my brain, I occasionally get as far away as I can. This time it was to India, where I learned a ton that I didn\u2019t know: I found India trying to leapfrog out of poverty and catch up to China by engaging in a rapid digitization of its entire economy and power grid.Yes, while our president has been busy playing golf, tweeting about LaVar Ball and pushing an anything-that-will-pass tax plan, China has been busy creating a cashless society, where people can pay for so many things now with just a swipe of their cellphones \u2014 including donations to beggars \u2014 or even buy stuff at vending machines with just facial recognition, and India is trying to follow suit.These are big trends, and in a world where data is the new oil, China and India are each creating giant pools of digitized data that their innovators are using to write all kinds of interoperable applications \u2014 for cheap new forms of education, medical insurance, entertainment, banking and finance.I was blown away by one big change in India in particular. In 2009, my friend Nandan Nilekani, the tech entrepreneur, led a team of experts that helped the then-Congress Party-led government launch a national digital identity system, known as Aadhaar (Hindi for \u201cbase\u201d).Every Indian, rich or poor, goes into a field office, has fingerprints and irises scanned into a biometric database and then linked to the individual\u2019s 12-digit ID number with basic identifiers: name, address, date of birth and sex. When the Congress Party left office in 2014, and Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party took over, Modi continued and impressively energized the Aadhaar project, bringing it today to 1.18 billion users, out of a population of about 1.3 billion.In a country where many poor people lacked any form of ID, like a birth certificate or a driver\u2019s license, this has been a revolution, because they can now open a bank account and get government aid sent directly to them \u2014 rather than having bureaucrats, bankers or postal workers skim off 30 percent each year through the mail \u2014 and then link their bank account to their mobile phones, from which they can buy, sell, transfer money and receive payments digitally anytime anywhere.The digital network platforms that have broken the one-billion-plus user mark \u2014 like Facebook, Google and WhatsApp \u2014 all came out of the private sector. Aadhaar, noted the Harvard Business Review, is the only non-U.S. platform \u201cto have broken the one-billion-user threshold and the only such system to have been developed by the public sector.\u201d It also has the distinction of \u201chaving reached one billion users the fastest.\u201dWhen the British laid railroads in India it led to the more efficient extraction of natural resources. Now the Indian government, through the combination of a trusted unique ID platform \u2014 tied to cellphones and mobile bank accounts \u2014 is creating a kind of digital railroad enabling the more efficient empowerment of human resources.\u201cIt\u2019s transforming the lives of ordinary people,\u201d explained Alok Kshirsagar, a McKinsey partner based in Mumbai. \u201cMillions are already benefiting from digital payments and credit. There are already more than 30 percent productivity gains when digital capabilities are used in agriculture, transportation and manufacturing. We are in the early stages of a transformation that could generate as much as $1 trillion in economic value over the next seven to 10 years.\u201dNow any Indian farmer can just go to one of 250,000 government community centers \u2014 each with a computer, Wi-Fi and a local entrepreneur who manages it \u2014 log into a government digital services website with the farmer\u2019s unique ID and instantly print out a birth certificate or land records needed for transactions.An Indian friend told me: \u201cMy driver has two bank accounts, and he has given one debit card to his wife and another to his son. And now he tells me he puts X amount of his salary into one account and Y into another, using his cellphone, so his wife is empowered and not asking her mother-in-law for money, because she has her own debit card, and the son, who is off in school training to be a doctor, can be independent.\u201dNilekani and his wife, Rohini, have built a foundation, EkStep, to create mobile education apps to help parents, teachers and students \u2014 armed only with cellphones \u2014 to learn faster, using these new digital networks. As Shankar Maruwada, an EkStep co-founder and its C.E.O., explained: Unlike, say Facebook, whose business model is to \u201cretain your attention,\u201d EkStep, Aadhaar and other such \u201csocietal platforms\u201d are designed to \u201crestore your agency,\u201d particularly to the poor.The West got economically rich \u201cbefore it got data rich,\u201d added Pramod Varma, EKStep\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cSo when data came along, it just became a better way to sell you things. They could target you better; you became a better customer for them. But in a country like India, where per-capita income is $2,000, today you can get data rich before you get economically rich. And if you empower people with their data, they can use their data to get better loans, get better skills, and build a digital repository that captures their skills to get better salaries.\u201dSimilar innovations are going on in energy, explained Mahesh Kolli, president of Greenko, India\u2019s largest renewable power provider. Theft of electricity from state-owned distribution companies amounted to some 20 percent of their output, as people strung wires to siphon from the grid, or the companies couldn\u2019t identify users.Now the government \u201ccan link my unique ID to my electricity bill\u201d and then directly and digitally connect my government subsidy, if I am poor, to that electric bill, said Kolli. Greenko just built the largest solar project in the world \u2014 a 3,000-acre field of Chinese-made solar panels generating 800 megawatts powering over 600,000 homes in Andhra Pradesh. Two more such fields are on the way up, all connecting to the national grid.Oh, and by the way, for those of you who want to preserve coal jobs, this 800-megawatt solar farm \u201cwas built with over 5,000 skilled and semiskilled workers,\u201d said Kolli. \u201cWe believe the renewable energy sector will create over one million new generation jobs to meet the 175-gigawatt target set by Prime Minister Modi.\u201dGreenko builds these plants, he added, \u201cin five months using Chinese panels and European inverter-grid integration technologies made in India.\u201d (Notice the absence of U.S. technology in that loop.) Greenko is also making huge strides in battery technology to store solar energy, so it can be used when the sun is not shining, and the company is now in the midst of building the first grid-connected battery storage system integrated with its solar farms.\u201cNo new coal or gas power plants are being built in India today,\u201d he added, \u201cnot because of regulations, but because solar, wind, hydro are all now able to compete with coal plants without subsidies.\u201dBottom line, the Indian energy economy is rapidly transitioning to a \u201cdecarbonized, digitized and decentralized\u201d system, said Kolli, enabling better quality of life while meeting big energy needs \u2014 without the government having to deal with all the protests that come with building coal- or gas-fired plants.So while we\u2019ve been following Trump\u2019s tweets about bringing back \u201cbeautiful coal,\u201d India built a billion-user ID network bigger than Twitter and giant solar power plants that are cheaper than coal.That\u2019s what you missed \u2014 and that\u2019s just one country. Are you tired of winning yet?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Corporate Taxes, Musk vs. Buffett, and Will Fox Strike a Deal?", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Profits at America\u2019s biggest companies grew 6.2 percent, driven largely by technology firms.\u2022 Railroad companies are on notice. Elon Musk is coming for them.\u2022 Stitch Fix is the only tech company led by a woman to go public this year.\u2022 21st Century Fox is courting several interested buyers. But the Justice Department may not let a big media marriage happen. That is one of the many debated questions. Proponents of the Republicans\u2019 plans argue that companies will invest the money. Opponents counter that firms will return the cash to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends.\u201cWhen all variables are measured properly, it seems major companies are paying out to shareholders about 22 percent of their net income. It\u2019s therefore unlikely that new profit, as might follow from lower corporate tax rates, will simply be drained out of the corporation.\u201cMore generally, sending money back to investors doesn\u2019t have to mean no new investment. What if those investors take the money and put it in a venture capital fund or invest it in some other manner? The whole point of capital markets is to recycle resources into the most profitable new opportunities, and that may or may not involve the companies that initially earned those profits.\u201dWith 95 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported third-quarter results, earnings are on pace to grow 6.2 percent from a year earlier, according to FactSet. That\u2019s up from the 3.1 percent growth rate expected at the end of period.Technology companies drove much of the growth. The sector reported a 19.7 percent increase in earnings and was the biggest contributor to earnings growth rate. If the tech sector was excluded, the overall growth rate would fall to 2.8 percent from 6.2 percent.Here are some more takeaways from earnings season:\u2022 Profits at companies that generate more that 50 percent of their sales outside the United States, grew more than 13 percent in the third quarter. Earnings at firms that get a majority of their revenue from within the U.S., rose only 2.3 percent.That is a reversal of what many analysts expected at the beginning of 2017. A stronger American dollar, a pickup in the United State\u2019s economy, and the Trump administration\u2019s policies were expected to benefit companies with the greatest exposure to United States were expected to benefit more from the Trump administration\u2019s policies, and a stronger dollar. But the United States dollar remained weaker.\u2022 The energy sector reported the largest increase in earnings of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors at 135 percent. The increase is a reflection of how hard the roughly two year slide in oil prices had hit the industry.\u2022 74 percent of companies have reported profits above analysts expectations, above the five-year average of 69 percent.\u2022 Financial firms reported the biggest decline in profits, down 8.3 percent. That decline can largely be blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Insurance companies in the sector reported 63 percent decrease in profits.\u2022 90 percent of the companies in the S&P 500\u2019s technology sector exceeded analyst estimates.\u2014 Stephen GrocerA traditional diesel truck can be operated for $1.51 a mile; the Tesla Semi, he said, beats that with $1.26.But it gets better.

In November 2009, his Berkshire Hathaway bought Burlington Northern Santa Fe. It was, he said at the time, a bet on the United States economy as it rebounded from the financial crisis.The online retailer\u2019s shares opened at $16.90, up 13 percent in its first day of trading.The I.P.O. differs from the typical Silicon Valley start-up that hits the public markets. The company kept its valuation relatively low, and it has generated a profit two years in a row.In fact, only 4.2 percent of all I.P.O.s in the United States were led by woman from 2000 to 2015. That compares to 6.4 percent of Fortune 500 companies run by a woman.The reasons are well known: The internet and newer players like Netflix have upended the media and telecom landscapes. Size and scale seem more important than ever. It\u2019s the premise of the AT&T and Time Warner deal, which itself echoes Comcast buying NBCUniversal.More in media consolidationAcross the industry, digital-media companies are finding that lines of business that caught fire for them early on \u2014 like creating custom content for brands \u2014 are becoming harder to scale up. Meanwhile, with each passing year, Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. are tightening their grip on the online-ad market.Extra creditThe leak of 210,000 gallons in South Dakota came days before the Public Services Commission of Nebraska is to vote on a permit for the pipeline\u2019s bigger sibling, Keystone XL.After his election, President Trump issued an executive order to clear obstacles for the Keystone XL, but TransCanada still needed a permit from the independent, five-person Nebraska PSC. Concerns there have revolved around potential harm to the state\u2019s ecologically delicate Sandhills region and its vast Ogallala aquifer, prompting TransCanada to move the Nebraska segment further east.What else have people found in the tax overhaul?The goal is to hit the ground running in overhauling an agency that some Republicans have called corrupt and that GOP lawmakers widely blame for burdening lenders with unnecessary red tape. It could be months before Trump nominates a permanent C.F.P.B. director and the Senate confirms his selection.The $1 trillion investor is talking about selling all of its holdings in oil companies. That\u2019s likely to give the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, which is working on an I.P.O., some heartburn.\u201cThe Norwegian view is that oil has had a good run and will have a good run for a couple of decades but it\u2019s not the only future that is out there.\u201dChina knows that, as demand for oil declines in much of the developed world, ever more of Aramco\u2019s barrels must flow east anyway. So the idea it will buy a big slug of Aramco at anything more than a discounted price \u2014 without some sort of sweetener in terms of a low-priced oil supply contract anyway \u2014 is a stretch.It\u2019s made by Tesla, of course. And it\u2019s both battery-powered and almost entirely self-driving.\u201cThe point of doing this is to give a hard-core smackdown to gasoline cars,\u201d he said to a cheering crowd of more than 2,000 people. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco and back.\u201dThe online clothing seller priced its stock market debut at $15 a share, well below its expected range. Is that because while the company is profitable, Jeff Bezos could yet crush it?The challenge that Stitch Fix faces is one that has burdened other start-ups like the food delivery service Blue Apron and the social networking phenomenon Snapchat: incumbent giants that have the money and the hunger to crush upstart rivals.Advertisement"}

And there are rules about who is qualified to vouch for the authenticity and accuracy of such records.

{"Headline": "He Promised Riches and Entry to Canada. Now He\u2019s the Subject of a Fraud Case in Vancouver.", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 In the tightly knit world of Vancouver\u2019s wealthy Chinese immigrants, Paul Se Hui Oei stood out for his ties to some of Canada\u2019s most powerful politicians and his mastery of cultivating guanxi, or personal relationships, that attracted legions of Chinese clients eager for his assistance in gaining a legal foothold in Canada.\u201cEverything he said were lies,\u201d said Chen Wei, a Chinese immigrant who testified earlier this year in a case against Mr. Oei before a British Columbia Securities Commission panel. Mr. Chen\u2019s family invested one million Canadian dollars ($782,000) in Mr. Oei\u2019s project, according to hearing transcripts.The case is part of a pattern, experts say, of problems with Canada\u2019s immigration programs, which, like the United States, set aside coveted residency permits for foreign investors. Some also say it underscores a troubling flaw in the Canadian justice system, which often allows white-collar criminals to walk away with little more than a slap on the wrist.Mr. Oei has denied the accusations, but even if he is found to have committed fraud, he will face financial penalties only, not prison time.Mr. Oei, who immigrated to Canada in the 1980s, declined interview requests through his lawyer.The case against Mr. Oei was brought by the commission, an independent provincial regulatory agency. The panel, appointed by the government, is expected to rule on the case this month. Apart from the financial penalties, Mr. Oei faces a possible ban from working in the securities industry.In Vancouver, Mr. Oei owned an immigration consulting and financial services company, and sought to use his connections in the Chinese community to raise money for a recycling start-up, Cascade.But the commission says that from 2009 to 2013, Mr. Oei told investors that the project was approved by the British Columbia government (it was not) and that their investments would give Chinese citizens the right to immigrate to Canada, as well as shower them with profits. All they had to do was transfer funds into the trust account of a local lawyer and member of the Canadian Parliament, Joe Peschisolido.\u201cThis made investors feel safe, and that their money would be safe,\u201d Mila Pivnenko, one of the commission lawyers, told the panel. \u201cOf course, Oei was the only person who directed the lawyer where to disburse the funds from the trust account.\u201dThe commission said Mr. Oei secretly transferred millions of dollars meant for the recycling company into his own bank accounts and issued shares in companies with no assets to investors in order to avoid detection.Mr. Oei raised about 13.3 million Canadian dollars ($10.5 million) from 64 investors, but the commission says he kept 6.9 million Canadian dollars for himself. When Cascade went bankrupt in 2013, Mr. Oei told many investors they could recoup their money if they topped up their investment, without alerting them that he had never sent more that half the funds he had already raised from investors to the project, the commission said.Jiang Yicheng, 53, a businessman from China\u2019s coastal Zhejiang Province, said in a phone interview that during several visits to Vancouver, Mr. Oei chauffeured him and other Chinese investors around in a BMW, hosted lavish meals and showed off photos of himself posing with Canadian elected officials.Mr. Jiang was sold. He formed a consortium of Chinese investors who transferred more than $3 million for the recycling company, convinced by Mr. Oei\u2019s promises that the project was backed by the government and would allow him to immigrate.Mr. Oei \u201ctook advantage of our trust to cheat us,\u201d said Mr. Jiang, who has also filed a lawsuit in British Columbia against Mr. Oei. Mr. Jiang said he himself was successfully sued by the members of his consortium to recover their losses, which has left him penniless.Richard Kurland, a former national chairman of the Canadian Bar Association\u2019s citizenship and immigration section, said lax oversight from the Canadian government and a preference for funding law-enforcement departments that investigate violent crime and terrorism rather than white-collar crime added to the difficulties in policing the immigration programs. \u201cWhite-collar crime is tolerated because it\u2019s not a priority,\u201d he said.In an email, Canada\u2019s Ministry of Finance said the task force\u2019s concerns will be reviewed by a parliamentary committee.In the meantime, those who say they were defrauded by Mr. Oei have seen their lives turned upside down. In his testimony, Yang Baoxi, a Chinese immigrant in Vancouver, said his wife made two suicide attempts after they lost $1.3 million to Mr. Oei\u2019s project.\u201cIn the last few years,\u201d he said, \u201cI have been living in nightmare.\u201dChristopher Buckley and Adam Wu contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

The only way he could plausibly become king is under some sort of \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d or \u201cKind Hearts and Coronets\u201d scenario involving his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth; his father, Prince Charles; his brother, Prince William; and William\u2019s young children, George and Charlotte.But the engagement is significant, in part as a frivolously welcome distraction at a time of unrelenting bad news about the economy, about Britain\u2019s painful \u201cBrexit\u201d from Europe and about Britain\u2019s place in the world. More than that, it is an example of openness and inclusivity in a country that is sorely divided over issues like race and immigration.Ms. Markle\u2019s father is white and her mother is African-American, and so with one heady announcement, it seems, Harry and Ms. Markle have thrown out generations\u2019 worth of quietly repressed tradition and presented a new royal model to a country that will have to adjust to it, whether it wants to or not.\u201cThe royal family and the standards they normally have \u2014 they want them to be white and not divorced,\u201d said Asha Duncan, 31, who works in fashion advertising and was strolling in Kensington on Monday. \u201cMaybe she will get them moving with the times more,\u201d she said of Ms. Markle, \u201cshowing we live in a multicultural society.\u201dVisiting from Boston, Trevor Gailun, who is 41 and works in finance, said the emergence of a royal American in London could be only a plus.\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting that we have an American woman,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is good for the royal family and also for the world to have a little bit more diversity.\u201dGet the Morning Briefing in your inbox. What you need to know to start your day, each weekday morning.Not only that, he said, but \u201cAmericans are celebrity obsessed, and I think having a pretty well-known actress now as a princess \u2014 it does not really get better than that.\u201dBut if you read carefully you might find veiled traces of the racism and class-based snobbery that last year spurred Prince Harry to issue a highly unusual statement of indignation on Ms. Markle\u2019s behalf.But there was The Daily Mail back at it on Monday, explicitly pointing out that most of Prince Harry\u2019s previous girlfriends had been blonde, and going out of its way to make Ms. Markle\u2019s family back home sound like a bunch of eccentrically inbred rednecks.\u201cThe extended Markle family is possibly the most unusual to marry into the House of Windsor so far,\u201d the paper said on its website. Her half brother, for instance, is newly engaged (to a woman named Darlene), \u201cdespite being arrested after pointing a gun at her during a drink-fueled argument,\u201d the article reported.Meanwhile, the conservative columnist Melanie McDonagh groused in The Spectator about Ms. Markle\u2019s left-leaning political views and unsuitability, as a divorc\u00e9e, to be married in the Church of England. \u201cObviously, 70 years ago, Meghan Markle would have been the kind of woman the prince would have had for a mistress, not a wife,\u201d she wrote.The paper\u2019s website was full of a range of comments reflecting a range of views: from readers who marveled at what this new development signifies for Britain and for themselves, from readers who hate the royal family and want it to go away, and from readers who do not care at all.\u201cI\u2019d love to agree with this,\u201d wrote a reader named \u201cNyder,\u201d \u201cbut I have to point out that the current royal family have German heritage and it hasn\u2019t exactly led to English people viewing the Germans as their kin.\u201dAnna Schaverien contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Saudi Arabia, Where Family and State Are One, Arrests May Be Selective", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKing Salman\u2019s close relatives not only rule Saudi Arabia. They are also in business with it.A major Saudi investment firm founded by one of the king\u2019s sons, and now chaired by another, owns a significant stake in a conglomerate that does extensive government business, including in a shipbuilding partnership with a French defense contractor. A smaller firm founded by another of his sons says it invests in health care, telecommunications, education and other regulated or state-funded fields.None of that apparent conflict of interest seems to be against the law.But now their brother, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is leading a sweeping crackdown against what he has labeled \u201ccorruption\u201d that has swept up at least 11 princes from the House of Saud. But his immediate family\u2019s complicated and mostly undisclosed business interests are raising questions about what that accusation means in a kingdom where the law has so far included little or no regulation of what other countries have labeled and outlawed as self-dealing.The kingdom, an absolute monarchy, has also never attempted to create an independent court system to adjudicate claims. And if corruption is defined as private profit at the public expense, the practice is so pervasive that any measures short of revolutionary change may appear to be selective prosecution.\u201cIt is straight out of the autocrat\u2019s playbook,\u201d said Katherine Dixon, a researcher at Transparency International who has studied the Saudi defense industry. \u201cUsing state resources for your own ends is still O.K. if you are part of the right faction or clique, but because corruption is what people care about, it is used as a public rallying cry to justify a crackdown.\u201dShe and others compared Prince Mohammed\u2019s campaign to anti-corruption drives by President Xi Jinping in China or President Vladimir V. Putin in Russia, where prosecutions are often politically motivated.The Saudi Council of Ministers said Tuesday that all arrests were \u201cbased on specific evidence of criminality and acts that were intended criminal transgressions and resulted in unlawful gain.\u201d\u201cThe rights of the accused and the facts relating to the offenses are protected by law at all stages during the investigation and judicial process,\u201d the council added.\u201cUltimately, the king and some high members of the royal family can do what they want and make it legal later,\u201d he said, and the lack of regulation over royal self-dealing \u201copens the door wide to what would be considered corruption in other systems.\u201dMany Saudis appear to have applauded the crackdown. Two-thirds are under 30, many are frustrated by high unemployment, and some may take a certain satisfaction at even an arbitrary comeuppance for so many of the rich and powerful.Some cases may be clear-cut.One area that the official Saudi media say Prince Mohammed intends to investigate is flooding in the city of Jidda that killed more than 100 people in 2009. In that case, a Saudi businessman was accused of absconding with millions of dollars allocated for a Jidda sewage system and never installing any pipes.Beyond that case, only a few anonymously sourced reports of the potential charges have emerged. A professionally coordinated social media campaign, which appears to be organized by the government, has accused the most important prisoner, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the former chief of the national guard and a son of the previous king, of enriching himself at public expense by diverting funds from the national guard. Citing unnamed sources, news reports have suggested that he would be accused of hiring ghost employees and paying inflated contracts to companies he owned for equipment like walkie-talkies and bulletproof military gear.His brother, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, the former governor of Riyadh, will reportedly be accused of paying inflated contracts to companies he owned for a subway under construction in the capital.But in a country named for its ruling family, the line between public and private money can be hard to discern.The memo, disclosed in the trove of State Department documents released by WikiLeaks seven years ago, provided a detailed blueprint of the varied ways that money flows to members of the royal family either from state coffers or through private business in an otherwise opaque system.An embassy official received an unprecedented glimpse into royal finances when he visited the Ministry of Finance Office of Decisions and Rules in 1996, where servants came to pick up stipends for their royal masters. Sons of the founding king received as much as $270,000 a month, while a great-great-grandchild collected $8,000 a month. On top of those payments, bonuses of $1 million to $3 million were handed out to, say, construct a palace.Princes were known for borrowing money and simply never paying it back, which nearly led to the collapse of the National Commercial Bank. Royals were also known to act as the exclusive agents for foreign companies in the kingdom. When they founded their own businesses, they often relied on either government spending or state subsidies.\u201cIn other countries we talk about petty bribes,\u201d said Ms. Dixon of Transparency International. \u201cIn Saudi Arabia, it is theft on a grand scale.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He had resigned from his post as a fund-raiser via email earlier in the day, he said.\u201cThe Republican Party took control of the government against all odds, and the bottom line is\u201d they messed up, he said, using an expletive. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. It\u2019s going to hurt a lot of middle-class Republicans.\u201dThe tax legislation has proved particularly contentious in New York, since both the Senate and House versions of the bill would scrap state and local tax deductions. As a result, seven of nine New York Republicans in the House voted against the bill.The House bill also curtailed the deduction that homeowners can take for their mortgage interest payments, allowing deductions only up to $500,000 in loans. That would affect homeowners where prices are highest, such as in and around New York City, and on Long Island, where Mr. Louro has served as the regional finance chairman.Mr. Louro has been an outspoken supporter of Representative Lee Zeldin, whom he called \u201cthe best congressman\u201d and who has opposed the elimination of state and local tax deductions.\u201cThe bottom line is I told Lee I\u2019m done,\u201d Mr. Louro said. \u201cI\u2019m totally done.\u201dAs recently as last week, Mr. Louro had been trying to drum up support for a fund-raising visit to New York by Mr. Trump in early December.

Rechnitz had laid out during Mr. Seabrook\u2019s closely-watched trial went nearly unmentioned. There was no mention of the private jet that Mr. Rechnitz, a wealthy real estate scion, said he sponsored for New York Police Department officers, or the prostitute he said he brought aboard. There was hardly any mention of City Hall, to which Mr. Rechnitz claimed to have a direct line through his campaign contributions. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s name was never explicitly mentioned.As a result, the six hours of summations felt almost anti-climactic.\u201cPush aside all the noise,\u201d Kan Nawaday, a government prosecutor, urged jurors, asking them to focus instead on what he called Mr. Seabrook\u2019s quid-pro-quo scheme.Mr. Rechnitz was still central to both sides\u2019 closing arguments. As he had during cross-examination of Mr. Rechnitz, Paul Shechtman, Mr. Seabrook\u2019s lawyer, seized upon inconsistencies in Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s testimony and branded him a \u201cconsummate con man.\u201dMr. Shechtman also pieced together an alternative narrative of what happened in Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s office that December evening, when, Mr. Rechnitz said, he filled a Salvatore Ferragamo bag with cash before meeting Mr. Seabrook for dinner. The bag did not contain cash, Mr. Shechtman said; it contained Cuban cigars, which Mr. Rechnitz knew Mr. Seabrook favored.Mr. Shechtman pointed to surveillance footage of Mr. Rechnitz leaving his office building, the bag hanging loosely from his arm.\u201cNobody carries $60,000 that way,\u201d Mr. Shechtman said.And he reminded jurors that Mr. Rechnitz had initially told government investigators, in 2016, that he paid Mr. Seabrook in the late morning or early afternoon of Dec. 11. That inconsistency was evidence that Mr. Rechnitz was framing Mr. Seabrook to win the government\u2019s favor, Mr. Shechtman said; Mr. Rechnitz, who pleaded guilty to a fraud conspiracy charge, is cooperating with the government in the hopes of a reduced sentence.\u201cYou\u2019ve just bribed a major union official in New York City and you can\u2019t remember the time of day?\u201d Mr. Shechtman said. \u201cThe biggest problem with making up a story is that it\u2019s hard to keep it straight.\u201dGovernment lawyers, for their part, acknowledged that parts of Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s testimony had been unsavory, in both content and tone.\u201cIf this were a personality contest, he\u2019d be a loser,\u201d Russell Capone, another prosecutor, said. \u201cIf this were a morality contest, he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to participate.\u201dMr. Capone accused defense lawyers of using Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s standoffish persona and admitted criminal acts to distract from Mr. Seabrook\u2019s own criminal conduct \u2014 behavior that, he said, could be proven even without Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s testimony, through wiretaps and emails.\u201cTake away the focus on Jona Rechnitz for a moment,\u201d Mr. Capone said. \u201cYou will see that he\u2019s just the cherry on top, the final confirmation.\u201dMr. Rechnitz\u2019s unsavory past was more reason to believe his testimony about Mr. Seabrook, Mr. Capone said.\u201cThe people who can tell you about crimes are the people who committed them,\u201d he said.Mr. Seabrook had wanted to get close to Mr. Rechnitz because Mr. Rechnitz was a known political fund-raiser, Mr. Shechtman said, and Mr. Seabrook was toying with the idea of a mayoral run.\u201cYou can fault Norman Seabrook for falling for Jona\u2019s act. But it is a good act,\u201d Mr. Shechtman said. \u201cMany people in this city fell for it \u2014 people in politics, real estate, law enforcement, finance.\u201d\u201cHe was the head of a major, major union in the city,\u201d Mr. Shechtman said. \u201cHe was a big target, and Jona knew it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Henry Christensen III, Key Lawyer in Astor Case, Dies at 72", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHenry Christensen III, a renowned trust and estates lawyer whose conflicted loyalties cast him as a pivotal witness in the trial of Anthony D. Marshall for defrauding his mother, Brooke Astor, the philanthropist and doyenne of New York society, died on Nov. 3 in Brooklyn. He was 72.The cause was lung cancer, his wife, Constance, said.Mr. Christensen was esteemed but largely unknown outside his field until 2006, when Mr. Marshall, a Broadway producer and former ambassador who was Mrs. Astor\u2019s only son, was accused of swindling millions of dollars from his mother after she was found to have dementia.As her lawyer since 1991, Mr. Christensen was criticized \u2014 but never charged criminally \u2014 after overseeing amendments to Mrs. Astor\u2019s will in 2003 and other transactions that profited her son and daughter-in-law.Grilled for seven days on the witness stand, Mr. Christensen maintained that while legally representing both Mrs. Astor and her son, in accommodating Mr. Marshall he was only trying to play the peacemaker. Moreover, he said, when he refused to accede to Mr. Marshall\u2019s additional demands for money or control, Mr. Marshall fired him.Mr. Christensen was born on Nov. 8, 1944, in Jersey City to Henry Christensen Jr., a numismatist, and the former Margaret Louise Brooke. He was known as Terry, from the Latin word tertium, meaning third.Raised in Madison, N.J., he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in literature from Yale in 1966 and graduated from Harvard Law School.He married Constance Cumpton in 1967. In addition to her, Mr. Christensen, who lived in Brooklyn, is survived by his children, Alexander, Gus, Elizabeth and Katherine Christensen; four grandchildren; and a sister, Karen Cheeseman.In 1969, Mr. Christensen joined the Manhattan law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, which had represented Mrs. Astor since her husband, Vincent, died in 1959. He was a partner there from 1977 until he left to join another firm, McDermott Will & Emery, in 2007.He was a founder and chairman of the Prospect Park Alliance, which has helped rejuvenate the once forlorn Brooklyn greensward designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux; a trustee of the Vincent Astor Foundation, the philanthropy that Mrs. Astor ran until 2002; and the chairman of the nonprofit Theater for a New Audience.The author of \u201cInternational Estate Planning\u201d (1992), Mr. Christensen was the president of the International Academy of Trust and Estate Law, taught at New York University and advised the Treasury Department and other agencies on tax provisions related to offshore trusts and combating the financing of terrorism.A riveting six-month trial ensued, dominated by clashing accounts of tawdry greed and filial devotion delivered by boldface names and household help. Witnesses testified that Mrs. Astor was of unsound mind when she was bamboozled by her son into giving him control over the bulk of her $180 million estate at the urging of his wife, Charlene.The defense argued that Mr. Christensen, in effect, attested to Mrs. Astor\u2019s competence when he supervised her execution of an amendment, or codicil, to her will in December 2003 that granted her son more control over which charities would receive millions from a family trust.About two weeks later, though, Mr. Marshall complained to Mr. Christensen that he was still concerned about his own \u201ceconomic welfare\u201d and requested another amendment that would give him full discretion over the trust. When Mr. Christensen declined, Mr. Marshall dismissed him.\u201cI gave 15 years of devoted, undivided attention to Mrs. Astor and I was fired,\u201d Mr. Christensen avowed from the witness stand. \u201cAnd I resent the suggestion that I was doing anything other than what she requested.\u201dThe defense reasoned that if Mrs. Astor was considered competent enough to sign the December codicil, she could not be judged incompetent less than a month later when, according to prosecutors, Mr. Marshall tricked her into agreeing to the even more generous second change.The prosecution also accused Mr. Marshall of grand larceny for giving himself a raise for managing his mother\u2019s finances, and for pocketing a $2 million commission when he sold a Childe Hassam painting belonging to his mother for $10 million after persuading her that she needed the money. (He was acquitted of grand larceny in the taking of the commission.)Mr. Christensen, who testified that he was unaware that Mr. Marshall was taking a commission on the sale, said he had assured Mrs. Astor, \u201cYou have all the money you need for the rest of your life.\u201dMr. Christensen said Mr. Marshall told him of a conversation with his mother in which she asked him, \u201cDo you want all of my money?\u201d Mr. Marshall said he replied that he simply wanted to designate which institutions received donations. But Mr. Christensen said he viewed Mrs. Astor\u2019s question as ironic.\u201cMrs. Astor was hoping that she had given him enough and that she wouldn\u2019t have to give him any more,\u201d Mr. Christensen said.\u201cI truly believe she understood what she was doing,\u201d he added, \u201cand hoped it would put things at peace.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misspelled the maiden name of Mr. Christensen\u2019s wife. She is the former Constance Cumpton, not Crumpton.Advertisement"}

I think that everyone recognizes that here,\u201d said the official, George David Banks, a senior energy adviser to President Trump. \u201cThat is one of the reasons other delegations are very supportive of making sure the U.S. delegation is as involved as possible.\u201dTwo years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, the world remains far off course from preventing drastic global warming in the decades ahead.But observers agree that most delegates are trying to remain respectful of their American counterparts, whatever private misgivings they may harbor.

Mr. Trump, after all, cannot officially pull out of the Paris agreement until 2020.

The Trump administration brought just 48 people to the talks in Bonn, far fewer than in previous years. China, by contrast, registered 81 people for the conference, and Canada 161.Now, Mr. Ca\u00f1ete said, Europe, along with Canada, has taken over the role of engaging China. \u201cFor sure the E.U. would prefer a very active United States here, but we are doing our best without them.\u201dMr. Banks said he believed the rest of the world understood that America was indispensable in the climate negotiations regardless of whether it was a party to the Paris agreement.\u201cHere\u2019s the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it gets tough, we stand up to China.

{"Headline": "C.E. Meyer Jr., 89, Dies; as T.W.A. Chief, He Fought a Takeover", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byC. E. Meyer Jr., a former head of Trans World Airlines who tussled with the corporate raider Carl Icahn in the mid-1980s in an unsuccessful effort to thwart a takeover, died on Nov. 4 in Norwalk, Conn. He was 89.The cause was complications of a fall incurred during his daily walk, his son Jeffrey said.Mr. Meyer was known as a level-headed businessman who oversaw the financial functions of two major airlines as the industry boomed and air travel was still considered glamorous. He joined Eastern Airlines in 1965 as assistant treasurer and moved to T.W.A. in 1968.After being promoted to senior vice president of finance in 1971, he became chief executive of the airline in 1976.Mr. Icahn\u2019s takeover bid, a tender offer of $600 million (about $1.4 billion in today\u2019s money), came after the airline industry was deregulated and consolidation had picked up.Mr. Icahn was at the time a much feared and sometimes loathed corporate raider. At a hearing in Washington in 1985, Mr. Meyer called Mr. Icahn one of the greediest men on earth and accused him of wanting to liquidate the airline, The New York Times reported. Referring to the takeover bid, Mr. Meyer was quoted as saying that \u201cMr. Icahn\u2019s presence is uninvited and undesirable\u201d and that his plan was not \u201csound or reasonable.\u201dTo fend off Mr. Icahn, Mr. Meyer negotiated a deal under which the airline\u2019s parent company, Trans World Corporation, would instead have sold T.W.A. to the Texas Air Corporation, which owned Continental Airlines and New York Air.The deal with Texas Air would have created the nation\u2019s second-largest airline, after United. But it was unpopular with union leaders and, in a victory for Mr. Icahn, rejected by the Trans World Corporation board.Mr. Icahn ultimately prevailed that summer and later took the company private. But Mr. Meyer\u2019s assessment of the Icahn scheme was proved right. T.W.A. filed for bankruptcy in 1992 and was acquired by American Airlines in 2001.Before the takeover, T.W.A. had been enduring heavy losses for years. To help stem them, the company in 1980 cut executive salaries by 25 percent or more. (Mr. Meyer\u2019s was $205,000, or about $640,000 when adjusted for inflation, The Times reported.) He oversaw hundreds of layoffs and in 1981 reduced the managerial ranks, including dropping two senior vice presidents.\u201cI finally had to come back to my office one day,\u201d he told The Times, \u201cand say to myself, \u2018Ed, can you run your outfit a little more efficiently and maybe work a little harder and do away with some people?\u2019 \u201d He added, \u201cManagement is taking its medicine, if you will.\u201dAfter leaving T.W.A. in 1985, Mr. Meyer ran Hilton International until he retired in 1988. Throughout his career he served on many corporate boards, including those of Hilton International, Trans World Corporation, B. F. Goodrich, the National and International Airline Transportation Associations and National Public Radio.Carl Edwin Meyer Jr. was born in Flushing, Queens, on Aug. 6, 1928, to Carl E. and Eunice Taylor Meyer. He graduated from St. Paul\u2019s School in Garden City, on Long Island, and from Amherst College in Massachusetts in 1950. He served in the Army Reserve until 1952.After his service, he joined the accounting firm Harris, Kerr, Forster & Company. He received his master\u2019s degree in business administration from New York University in 1957 after taking night classes there.Mr. Meyer, who died in Norwalk Hospital, lived nearby in New Canaan, Conn. Besides his son Jeffrey, he is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Ruth Oddy; another son, William; and four granddaughters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Saudi Arabia Reforms, What Happens to Islamists Elsewhere?", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow could this be? One has to go back nearly three centuries to begin to answer this question. Around 1744, a tribal chieftain, Muhammad ibn Saud, formed an alliance with an ultraconservative preacher named Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and created the first monarchical state on the Arabian Peninsula. On the one hand, there was the Saud family, governing the country by right of blood and succession; on the other, there was Wahhabism, an ultra-puritanical and extreme version of Islam it called the original Islam. A family and a clergy \u2014 the whole welded together over the decades as much by oil revenues as by the legitimacy deriving from proximity to Islam\u2019s holiest sites.Reform in Saudi Arabia now seems necessary \u2014 and yet, at the same time, impossible. How will the royal family manage to reject the clergy\u2019s support, stop the financing of fundamentalist networks and bring about nothing short of several revolutions regarding social rights? The kingdom\u2019s stability is at stake and, as a consequence, that of the entire region, too.The appearance of the man known as the \u201ciron prince\u201d \u2014 Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old heir to the throne \u2014 suggests that there may be a solution to the Saudi problem. Young, fiery, seen as a reformer, the crown prince has been making a splash since his father placed him at the forefront of the political scene about two years ago. He is proposing, for example, another kind of economic model than the one, built around oil and gas, that prevails today, and has announced development megaprojects and plans to open up the country to tourism unconditionally.The prince, nicknamed \u201cM.B.S.,\u201d even seems willing to try the unthinkable: granting women the right to drive or go to sport stadiums, eventually reopening cinemas and, above all, putting pressure on the clergy and announcing the review and certification of the great canons of Muslim orthodoxy, including the hadiths, the collection of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s sayings.Whatever the real effect of these changes in Saudi Arabia, they already are being felt elsewhere. If this country, the motherland of fatwas, undertakes reforms, Islamists throughout the world will have to follow suit or risk winding up on the wrong side of orthodoxy.In Algeria, for example, the hard-liners\u2019 discomfort is subtly palpable. On social media, the conspiracy theory seems to prevail: M.B.S.\u2019s stunt is seen as the product of an American injunction. But conservative newspapers and Islamist editorial writers \u2014 generally keen on all matters Saudi and quick to comment on any slight against Islam \u2014 are mostly quiet this time, or timid in their defense of Wahhabism. In mosques as well, silence dominates.Islamists in Algeria belong to one of two camps. One, supposedly ancestral and pure, claims kinship with Saudi Arabia and the Fatwa Valley. It is troubled by M.B.S.\u2019s reforms, fearing they may signal an end to its financing and a blow to its legitimacy.The other camp is of the Muslim Brotherhood stripe and close to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s Turkey; the Islamist political parties it has formed are tolerated by the Algerian government. But its members, too, are worried: If Saudi Arabia reforms, they will lose their mantle of tolerant Islamists and their position on Algeria\u2019s political chessboard. The Saudi crown prince, by casting himself as more moderate than moderates elsewhere, is pulling the rug from under their feet.And so all manner of Islamists are feeling the anxiety of being orphaned. The moderate camp, blindsided, may try to play catch-up with the prince. But the fundamentalist camp, bereft of its familiar markers, may turn against the Saudi kingdom to claim a new kind of legitimacy \u2014 and wage a sort of holy war against the holy land.Kamel Daoud is the author of the novel \u201cThe Meursault Investigation.\u201d This essay was translated by John Cullen from the French.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Tax Plan Diverges From House Version, Highlighting Political Pressures", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe disparate bills show the competing pressures that Republican lawmakers are facing and the calculations that Senate and House leaders are making to ensure passage of the bills through their respective chambers. While both bills share the main priorities of cutting corporate and individual taxes, they diverge on matters of high political sensitivity, particularly for vulnerable House Republicans from high-tax states and for Senate Republicans concerned about adding to the federal budget deficit.Senate staff members said their draft would require changes, likely major ones, to survive procedural rules that allow it to pass on a party-line vote. Those changes could include setting some of the tax cuts to expire after a period of years.Senators Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said the bill did not go far enough in increasing the child tax credit, which rose to $1,650 per child in the Senate version, from $1,600 in the House bill, and would now be available to families making up to $1 million a year, a leap from a current income limit of $110,000. \u201cThe Senate is not going to pass a bill that isn\u2019t clearly pro-family,\u201d they said in a joint statement, \u201cso we look forward to working with our colleagues to get there.\u201d\u201cThe Street definitely felt like there was some connection between tax policy and the market reaction, which was pretty severe,\u201d said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management in New York.FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group, called the Senate\u2019s plan to delay the corporate tax cut \u201cunacceptable.\u201dStill, several business groups and Republican leaders applauded the movement in both chambers. The influential National Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses and had opposed the House bill, reversed course and said it backed both an amended House bill and the Senate version. Other groups shook off the delayed rate cut and embraced the Senate plan.\u201cIt\u2019s been a week of remarkable progress,\u201d said Michael A. Steel, a former House leadership aide who is a managing director for Hamilton Place Strategies, a consultancy in Washington.Republican leaders expressed optimism that they could quickly address concerns and resolve the competing political pressures facing their lawmakers in the Senate and House.\u201cThis will be met with Senate consternation and all kinds of things,\u201d said Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois, who oversees the Ways and Means tax policy subcommittee. \u201cBut when it comes down to it, what we\u2019re on the verge today is winning an argument \u2014 winning an argument about the future of our economy and what our worldview is.\u201dThe bill set for introduction in the Senate Finance Committee includes seven income brackets, scuttling some of the simplicity that House drafters used to sell their bill, which reduced the number of brackets to four.It would keep the bottom tax bracket for individuals at 10 percent, which the House had raised to 12 percent, and would reduce the top rate for high earners to 38.5 percent, down from the current rate of 39.6 percent, which the House had maintained. Like the House bill, the Senate\u2019s version plans to roughly double the standard deduction and expand the child tax credit.The starkest example of the competing priorities is the state and local tax deduction, which is heavily used in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California, which are represented by Democrats in the Senate but have some Republican representatives in the House. The Senate completely eliminates the valuable tax break, which allows taxpayers to deduct state and local income, sales and property taxes. The House bill would still allow individuals to deduct property taxes up to $10,000.Some House Republicans have already rejected that limitation as too strict and the Senate\u2019s complete elimination could further spook those members, whose political future could be imperiled if they pass a plan that actually increases their constituents\u2019 tax bills.\u201cEvery state should be a winner in tax reform, and in my opinion, that would not be the case if the Senate view were to prevail,\u201d said Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey. \u201cI\u2019m not voting for the $10,000, so I\u2019m certainly not voting for zero,\u201d Mr. Lance said.The bill would add $1.5 trillion to federal budget deficits over a decade, without accounting for additional economic growth it might spur, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But Senate staff members suggested that the Finance Committee would need to make changes to ensure it does not lose revenue after 10 years, and thus stays in compliance with the procedural rules that would allow the bill to pass on a party-line vote.In another significant departure from the House bill, the Senate would not create a special, lower top rate for so-called pass-through entities, which are businesses whose profits are distributed to their owners and taxed as individual income. Instead, the Senate would create a 17.4 percent deduction on income taxes for pass-through owners of all income levels, effectively cutting rates both on rich owners and on middle-class small-business owners who would not have benefited from the House\u2019s original lower pass-through rate. For service-providing pass-throughs, it would phase out that benefit for individuals with income above $75,000 and for married couples with income above $150,000.On Thursday, in the face of pushback from fellow Republican lawmakers, small businesses and other industry groups, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, who leads the Ways and Means Committee, unveiled a 29-page amendment making further revisions to the House\u2019s tax plan. The amendment restores the adoption tax credit, which the House tax plan had planned to repeal. It also creates a new, lower tax rate for certain business owners.Under the new provision, the first $37,500 of business income would be taxed at 9 percent, rather than 12 percent, for an unmarried individual earning less than $75,000 through a pass-through business. For a married couple, the dollar amounts would be double.The Senate is also including a provision to prevent large multinational corporations from stashing profits overseas. The bill will propose a new business tax on American and foreign companies \u2014 effectively a minimum tax on their income earned in the United States \u2014 while also levying a 12.5 percent tax on income that American companies receive overseas from their intellectual property.Preliminary estimates indicate the provision would raise more than $130 billion in tax revenue over 10 years to help offset revenue lost from rate cuts, committee staff members said. The original House approach, which would have levied a 20 percent \u201cexcise tax\u201d on payments between American and foreign companies that are affiliated with each other, would have raised an estimated $155 billion in revenue.Advertisement"}

Simons, a reserved mathematician and hedge fund operator from Boston now approaching 80, is a big Democratic donor. Warren A. Stephens, a 60-year-old golf enthusiast once called the king of Little Rock, Ark., inherited a family investment bank and became a booster of conservative Republicans.But Mr. Simons and Mr. Stephens are both billionaires who have used the services of offshore finance \u2014 the trusts and shell companies that the world\u2019s wealthiest people use to park their money beyond the reach of tax collectors and out of the public eye.Mr. Simons was the main beneficiary of a private trust, never previously described, that was one of the largest in the world. In response to recent questions about the trust, Mr. Simons said that he had transferred his share to a Bermuda-registered charitable foundation.Mr. Stephens used an opaque holding company to own an approximately 40 percent stake in a loan business accused by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of cheating working-class and poor Americans. While earning millions from the investment, Mr. Stephens helped finance a political onslaught against the bureau, never mentioning his personal connection to the fight.Appleby operates in a rarefied universe of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, where yachts and private jets are preferred transport and mansions sit empty because their owner has several others. Some of Appleby\u2019s customers are also P.E.P.\u2019s \u2014 politically exposed persons \u2014 for whom avoiding unwanted attention is a crucial goal.\u201cThe Right People. The Right Places,\u201d reads the slogan on Appleby\u2019s stationery.Appleby board minutes contain lists of \u201cdeclined business,\u201d including government officials suspected of corruption and millionaires linked to organized crime.Still, some dubious clients slip through. A PowerPoint slide used by Appleby\u2019s head of compliance discusses terrorist financing and refers to funds that were \u201cdefinitely tainted.\u201d\u201cSome of the crap we accept is amazing totally amazing,\u201d say notes to a slide about sizing up potential customers.Even with some potential customers turned away, business has rarely been better. The ranks of the superrich are growing fast, fueled by legitimate fortunes in finance, trade and technology \u2014 as well as drugs, embezzlement and bribery. And the offshore finance industry has grown alongside its customers\u2019 accounts.A 2015 Appleby publication written for such clients, \u201cWealth Structuring 20:20,\u201d features photos of a handsome couple and their children hurrying to board a sleek personal jet. \u201cWealth seeks out safe harbours,\u201d one article is titled. Another advises on \u201cMotivating children of means.\u201dIn emails, Appleby employees fret about how to pamper well-heeled clients.\u201cOur fees are around 40k and they are the sort of people who I think would appreciate popping a bottle on closing at Appleby this afternoon,\u201d a lawyer in the firm\u2019s Grand Cayman office wrote in 2008 of a particular deal. \u201cDo you have the key to the booze vault? It would need to be decent stuff as they\u2019ll know their champagne.\u201dAppleby had 31,000 American clients, the most common nationality by far. The firm\u2019s files include a who\u2019s who of the nation\u2019s wealthiest citizens: prominent Democrats like George Soros, the financier and philanthropist, and Penny Pritzker, commerce secretary in the Obama administration; and high-profile Republican supporters of President Trump, including Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate, and Carl Icahn, the private equity investor.Queen Elizabeth II, according to Appleby documents, used a Cayman Islands fund to invest in a company that owned a share of a British rent-to-own company widely criticized for financing the sale of household items at interest rates as high as 99.9 percent. The leaked files reveal Madonna\u2019s shares in a medical supplies firm, Bono\u2019s investment in a Lithuanian shopping center and the Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen\u2019s yacht and submarines.Around the globe, the documents disclose the holdings of rulers and politicians. The list includes three former prime ministers of Canada, the queen dowager of Jordan and at least five members of the Qatari ruling family.Founded in 1898 by a British officer, Maj. Reginald Appleby \u2014 an avowed opponent of taxation \u2014 Appleby now has offices in nearly all the world\u2019s tax havens: Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Hong Kong, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Mauritius, the Seychelles and Shanghai.Such locations offer low or zero tax rates, companies consisting only of a postbox, and accountants and lawyers skilled at hiding money.In a statement, Appleby said the firm had done nothing wrong. \u201cWe are an offshore law firm who advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe do not tolerate illegal behaviour.\u201dIn recent years, billionaires\u2019 fortunes have grown by an average of 7 to 8 percent a year, while total wealth has grown at just 3 percent annually, said Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Globalization, deregulation and declining taxes have all been factors.\u201cThe other important thing is the rise of the global, cross-border wealth management industry,\u201d including Appleby, Mr. Zucman said.The richest 1 percent of the world\u2019s population now owns more than half of global wealth, and the top 10 percent owns about 90 percent.\u201cThe data suggests that most of the gains at the top are coming at the expense of the rest of the population,\u201d Mr. Zucman said. That conclusion is shared by many other scholars.The wealthy use the power that accompanies their money, he said, to exert political influence, reduce taxes and regulation \u2014 and hire experts to keep their money safe.Mr. Simons, the hedge fund billionaire, was a young math professor in 1974 when a Colombian friend established a trust in Bermuda on his behalf using a gift of $100,000 to him, his parents and his descendants. American tax authorities would consider the Lord Jim Trust, as it was named, a foreign entity, limiting the visibility of the Internal Revenue Service into its holdings and its ability to tax its funds until it made distributions to the Simons family. (Appleby did not create the trust but later provided legal advice.)In 1982, Mr. Simons founded Renaissance Technologies, a New York-based hedge fund whose secret trading algorithms soon generated rates of return that became storied on Wall Street. Over the next three decades, Renaissance became one of the most lucrative hedge funds on the planet, making Mr. Simons a billionaire many times over.Mr. Simons, in response to questions, said that when he and his family received distributions from the Bermuda trust, they were reported to the I.R.S. But Mr. Simons said he and his relatives took out only limited amounts, mainly in the early years of the trust, whose main investments were Renaissance funds that enjoyed spectacular returns.As Renaissance\u2019s investments grew, so did its footprint in American life. Mr. Simons became one of the country\u2019s top political donors. During the last election cycle, he was the sixth-largest contributor to political candidates and causes, giving more than $26 million, nearly all to Democrats, including $11 million to Priorities USA Action, a political action committee supporting Hillary Clinton.Mr. Simons\u2019s business partner and Renaissance\u2019s departing co-chief executive, Robert Mercer, rose to the highest ranks of Republican donors and became an influential backer of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, contributing more than $3 million. A major funder of Breitbart News, Mr. Mercer influenced critical decisions of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, such as the hiring of Stephen K. Bannon, then Breitbart\u2019s executive chairman, as the campaign\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Mercer has also been an Appleby client.As the tax dispute has proceeded, Mr. Simons is now estimated to be the 25th-richest person in the United States, with a net worth estimated at $18.5 billion, according to the Forbes list of richest Americans. But such rankings, important yardsticks in the study of global development and inequality, often rely on incomplete public data.Mr. Simons\u2019s Lord Jim Trust offers one example. Though the trust has been listed in various filings, a 2010 document in Appleby\u2019s files provides details for the first time. If it had been fully accounted for in calculating his net worth, he would have vaulted even higher in the ranks of the superrich.\u201cSo far it has not been very active,\u201d Mr. Simons wrote in a response to questions from The Times. \u201cIn future years, as my income decreases and ultimately ceases, SFI will play an increasingly larger role in funding.\u201dBut the Simons Foundation International operates in obscurity. Though it would easily rank in the top 10 foundations in the United States, it has no website.Mr. Simons said that keeping the foundation in Bermuda made it easier to give to charities that weren\u2019t American and also avoided the minimal annual giving requirements that foundations must follow in the United States.Ray D. Madoff, a professor of law at Boston College who focuses on philanthropies and taxes, said that in terms of oversight and transparency, \u201cthe first sin was whatever it was that allowed however many billions of dollars of a U.S. citizen to be growing tax free in Bermuda.\u201dBut Michael G. Pfeifer, a Washington lawyer who specializes in estate planning for wealthy people and helped write the tax rules governing overseas trusts, said that Mr. Simons merely followed the rules.\u201cI would have told the guy, \u2018You\u2019ve got this money offshore \u2014 just leave it offshore,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pfeifer said. \u201cAnd he did.\u201dIf Mr. Simons\u2019s motive for setting up offshore entities is complex, Mr. Stephens\u2019s seems more obvious.In late 2011, representatives of Mr. Stephens and his business partner, James R. Carnes, asked Appleby to incorporate two offshore companies as part of a plan to help Native American tribes set up lending operations, a common business tactic because such ventures can claim tribal immunity against outside legal challenges.The new venture\u2019s parent company, Hayfield Investment Partners, was incorporated in Delaware \u2014 considered a tax haven like a half-dozen other American states, underscoring that secrecy and tax advantages are not limited to palm-dotted tropical islands. Hayfield already had a separate subsidiary called Integrity Advance, an online payday loan company whose lending practices were coming into the cross hairs of regulators across the United States.Documents in Appleby\u2019s files show that Mr. Stephens and his funds owned 40 percent of Hayfield, which received additional investments from executives of Stephens Inc., the family investment bank, and acquaintances like the golf star Phil Mickelson, who contributed $12,000.It did not take long for Integrity Advance to generate complaints from borrowers and regulators. People short of cash who took out small loans would later see large withdrawals from their bank accounts for interest and services fees that often far exceeded the amount they originally borrowed.By November 2012, Integrity Advance had received cease-and-desist letters from state regulators in Connecticut, Kentucky, Illinois, Mississippi and South Carolina. In May 2013, a Minnesota district court ordered the company to pay nearly $8 million in civil penalties and victim restitution, saying that the firm had targeted financially vulnerable citizens with interest rates as high as 1,369 percent.One borrower, Nils Paul Warren, a broadcast audio technician for Nascar in Orlando, complained to Florida regulators that he\u2019d had to shell out more than $1,300 to repay a short-term $500 online loan he got from Integrity Advance in 2009 \u2014 a sum far greater than what he had expected.\u201cI think the bulk of their clientele are people who are a paycheck away from being homeless,\u201d Mr. Warren said in an interview.As complaints mounted, Mr. Stephens and Mr. Carnes sold part of Integrity Advance to a pawnshop-style loan company, Ezcorp. Eventually the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused Integrity Advance of \u201cfalse and deceptive\u201d tactics, and last year, an administrative law judge recommended to the head of the bureau that the company and Mr. Carnes, its chief executive, pay more than $51 million in fines and restitution to borrowers. Integrity Advance and Mr. Carnes are appealing the ruling.In its legal action against Integrity Advance, the bureau emphasized Mr. Carnes\u2019s 52 percent ownership of Hayfield, the parent company. Neither regulators nor the news media has ever mentioned Mr. Stephens\u2019s sizable stake. (Mr. Stephens declined to comment.)If he kept quiet about his role in the embattled payday loan business, he showed no similar reticence in attacking the consumer bureau. In June 2013, he told The Wall Street Journal that the bureau bore some blame for lagging business growth. \u201cThe stories we hear about that are pretty scary,\u201d the billionaire said.During last year\u2019s campaign, Mr. Stephens contributed $3 million to Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee that has pushed Congress to strip the bureau\u2019s enforcement powers.Along with helping bankroll such Washington battles, Mr. Stephens has recently used his investment bank, Stephens Inc., to start an online video series called \u201cThis Is Capitalism\u201d to improve millennials\u2019 opinion of free-market economics.Spencer Woodman is a reporter for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

{"Headline": "Cuomo, a Master of the $50,000 Fund-Raiser, Bypasses Small Donors", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt $25 million and counting, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo sits atop the largest tower of campaign contributions of any Democratic politician in America. But this monument to his prodigious fund-raising strength also reveals one of his greatest vulnerabilities, especially if he harbors presidential ambitions.He has virtually no small donors.Since the beginning of 2015, Mr. Cuomo has raised over 99 percent of his campaign money from donations larger than $1,000 and nearly 99.9 percent of his funds from donors who gave at least $200, according to an analysis by The New York Times. At one point last year, Mr. Cuomo went six months without reporting a single individual donor who gave less than $200.\u201cYou almost have to try to have that few,\u201d said Michael Whitney, who served as Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s digital fund-raising manager on his 2016 presidential campaign. He said that if Mr. Cuomo were to run for president and maintain his \u201ccomically absent number of small donors,\u201d it could cripple him in an era where both parties, but particularly Democrats, have become reliant on an army of small givers to compete at the national level.\u201cI don\u2019t understand how he can credibly use his current fund-raising operation and be a viable candidate for 2020,\u201d Mr. Whitney said.Mr. Cuomo insists he is only running for a third term as New York governor in 2018, his \u201cdream job,\u201d he said last week, brushing aside questions about his further ambitions.Even if Mr. Cuomo ends his 2018 re-election with a sizable surplus, he cannot use his state account to fund a potential presidential campaign because those funds are not transferable. But Mr. Cuomo\u2019s vast network of large donors would be the envy of most politicians, and his patrons could always spend millions on an independent super PAC.Nonetheless, the overwhelming reliance on big checks makes Mr. Cuomo an outlier even among the best fund-raisers in the country.Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas \u2014 a Republican who has the most campaign money in the country, $41 million \u2014 has raised over $2.8 million from nearly 75,000 contributions of $200 or less since his 2014 re-election, according to his campaign officials.Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California and a leading Democratic candidate for governor in 2018, has one of the largest campaign treasuries in the nation, with $16 million. In the first six months of 2017, he had 34,096 donors who gave $200 or less, his campaign said.Mr. Newsom\u2019s median donation during that period was $10; Mr. Cuomo\u2019s was $2,500. Mr. Newsom raised over $668,000 from such donors, compared to roughly $5,000 for Mr. Cuomo.\u201cThe governor has received contributions of all sizes from thousands of supporters, and these varying donations help bolster his strong progressive agenda to improve the lives of all New Yorkers.\u201d said William J. Mulrow, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign chairman. \u201cWe look forward to building on that record in the third term.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign account has grown by over $23.6 million since the start of 2015 but only roughly $30,000 came from individual donors who gave less than $200, the federal threshold for disclosure.\u201cSmall-dollar fund-raising and online fund-raising has been a nonnegotiable for both Obama campaigns, for Bernie and Hillary,\u201d said Betsy Hoover, the director of digital organizing for President Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine what a serious presidential looks like that doesn\u2019t get that kind of buy-in and participation from a broader swath of donors.\u201dIn the first six months of this year, Mr. Cuomo raised over $5 million, but reported fewer than 100 total small donors who collectively gave less than $5,000. Over that same period, Mr. Cuomo earned far more in interest and dividends on his deposited donations; over $100,000 was paid on June 30.\u201cIt shows who he does appeal to \u2014 which is powerful, vested, moneyed interests,\u201d said Stephanie Miner, a Democrat and the mayor of Syracuse who is contemplating challenging Mr. Cuomo in a primary.If she were to run, Ms. Miner said her campaign would follow \u201cthe Bernie Sanders, Howard Dean, Daily Kos model\u201d of seeking small contributions online.Mr. Cuomo has long resisted investing capital to create a formidable digital footprint for his campaigns, according to past advisers.\u201cGovernor Cuomo set out a transformational plan to restore New York to greatness and has spent three and half years making that plan a reality,\u201d his home page says.Mr. Cuomo has been governor for nearly seven years.\u201cPolitics changed in the last few years and Andrew Cuomo hasn\u2019t shown that he\u2019s noticed,\u201d said Zephyr Teachout, the then-little-known professor who challenged Mr. Cuomo for the Democratic nomination in 2014. \u201cThe deep, legitimate anger at big corporate monopolies is not something Andrew Cuomo understands. In fact, that\u2019s his donor base.\u201dPast and present advisers to Mr. Cuomo say the governor has long been in his element wooing the wealthy for large checks. In September, he hosted a fund-raiser at Madison Square Garden during a Paul McCartney concert.In December, Mr. Cuomo is throwing a birthday fund-raiser that will feature former President Bill Clinton and a performance by Jon Bon Jovi. Top-tier access to the event, which includes a private reception with the governor, will cost $50,000.Mr. Cuomo did hold a relatively rare \u201cgrass-roots\u201d event last Thursday at Hudson Terrace in Manhattan with $100 tickets and a \u201climited number\u201d of $50 spots available.Joe Trippi, who served as campaign manager for Mr. Dean\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign, which pioneered raising smaller contributions online, said Mr. Cuomo still has the time and resources to cultivate a small-donor network.\u201cThe requirement to do that is a message that energizes people and they\u2019re excited about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen that from him yet.\u201dMr. Cuomo has a long way to go to catch up to past presidential contenders\u2019 small donor programs.Mr. Cuomo? Just above 0.1 percent.\u201cYou would think, having watched the last three presidential cycles, that if he\u2019s serious about that, that will change,\u201d Mr. Trippi said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like when he updates the website that\u2019s when you know he\u2019s running. Instead of his first trip to Iowa the sign might be, hey, I got an email!\u201dAdvertisement"}

The reason why? Primarily that Emerson couldn\u2019t meet its fellow industrial parts maker\u2019s price expectations \u2014 and had no other negotiating levers to pull.Rockwell had repeatedly said that it viewed the takeover bids as too low. By going public, Emerson was hoping to get shareholders in the target company to apply pressure on management. That didn\u2019t work, however: Shares in Rockwell never meaningfully approached the level of any of its suitor\u2019s proposals, suggesting that investors weren\u2019t particularly hoping for a deal.And Rockwell had some defenses that Emerson couldn\u2019t breach, including a staggered board and no provision for shareholders to call special meetings. That meant Emerson couldn\u2019t wage a proper proxy fight to replace directors at the target company\u2019s board.\u201cInstead of engaging in constructive dialogue, the Rockwell board decided to let this unique and value-generative opportunity go unexplored,\u201d David Farr, Emerson\u2019s chairman and C.E.O., said in a statement.Looks like deal junkies will have to wait for Broadcom to go hostile against Qualcomm for their merger fight fix.It has now been more than three weeks since Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the face of the kingdom\u2019s business elite for decades, was detained without explanation as part of a purported anticorruption drive.

{"Headline": "Ex-Leader Wins First Round of Chile\u2019s Presidential Vote", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTIAGO \u2014 Former President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era of Chile, a conservative billionaire, on Sunday won the first round of an election to choose a successor to President Michelle Bachelet.Mr. Pi\u00f1era, 67, who won 36 percent of the vote, will compete in a runoff election on Dec. 17 against a center-left journalist and former news anchor, Alejandro Guillier, 64, who received 22 percent of the ballots cast.The biggest surprise of the day was the surge of the left, representing a shift in Chile\u2019s political map.Coming in a close third was another journalist, Beatriz S\u00e1nchez, 46, who had no political experience but became well known for her acid political critiques on radio and television.Ms. S\u00e1nchez represented the leftist coalition Frente Amplio, which was founded early this year. Expected to draw less than 10 percent of the vote, she won over 20 percent.For the first time, as of next year political power will not be wielded solely by the two major coalitions that have governed Chile since the end of military rule in 1990. Preliminary results on Sunday evening showed significant gains by the Frente Amplio in Congress, as well as a stark generational shift and a greater number of women elected as lawmakers.\u201cWe\u2019ve been living in a democracy full of constraints, with the same politicians in government and Congress for too many years,\u201d said Patricia Bravo, 56, a drug rehabilitation therapist who supported Ms. S\u00e1nchez. \u201cThey already fulfilled their role, which was to transit towards democracy, but it is time to change. This election is an opportunity to start anew.\u201dThe election \u2014 which was also for the lower house of Congress and for half the seats in the Senate \u2014 was the first to be held under new electoral rules that limit campaign spending and impose greater transparency. The rules make voting voluntary and allow for more proportional representation in Congress. They also grant Chileans living abroad the right to vote, though only 11 percent of those eligible to vote in 62 countries registered to do so.Voter turnout was low, about 45 percent, in keeping with a consistent fall in electoral participation since the return to democracy in Chile after 17 years of military dictatorship. Marta Lagos, director of the polling group Latinobar\u00f3metro, said the apathy could be explained in large part by a general view that politicians are corrupt and public institutions are not to be trusted.Four members of Congress have been stripped of immunity from prosecution and dozens of politicians, their associates and relatives are being investigated for illegal campaign financing in earlier elections, influence-peddling and other white-collar crimes.\u201cPeople are disappointed with our democracy,\u201d Ms. Lagos said. \u201cParties and politicians have been totally discredited, and there is a widespread perception that all politicians are corrupt demons, that there is no one to vote for. People want a major transformation of the political system and corrupt politicians put in jail, and maybe then they will get out and vote.\u201dOn Sunday morning, a group of demonstrators forced their way into Mr. Pi\u00f1era\u2019s campaign center to protest the elections. More than 20 were arrested. In the Araucan\u00eda region, about 400 miles from Santiago, the capital, unidentified individuals intercepted a bus that was going to transport voters from rural areas to voting places and set it on fire.In all, eight people \u2014 an ideologically diverse array of candidates \u2014 were on the ballot on Sunday.Both the right-wing opposition and the governing coalition, New Majority, had two candidates competing against each other for the presidency. Mr. Pi\u00f1era was flanked to the right by the extremely conservative Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, who advocates building a physical barrier along Chile\u2019s northern border with Peru and Bolivia, withdrawing from international treaties and organizations, and abolishing a recently approved law permitting abortions in some cases.Against all predictions, Mr. Kast drew nearly eight percent of the vote.Mr. Guillier was competing with a political ally, Carolina Goic, of the more conservative wing of the centrist Christian Democratic party. The remaining three candidates were all to the political left of Mr. Guillier.Ms. Bachelet will finish her four-year term in March. Under Chile\u2019s Constitution, she cannot run for immediate re-election. Battered by criticism, sagging popular support and a high-profile corruption case involving her son and daughter-in-law, Ms. Bachelet has publicly vowed that she will not seek any elected office in Chile in the future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "The Paradise PapersThe tech giant has found a tax haven in the island of Jersey, leaving billions of dollars untouched by the United States, leaked documents reveal.Supported byTim Cook was angry.\u201cWe pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar,\u201d Mr. Cook declared at the hearing. \u201cWe don\u2019t depend on tax gimmicks,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe don\u2019t stash money on some Caribbean island.\u201dTrue enough. The island Apple would soon rely on was in the English Channel.Five months after Mr. Cook\u2019s testimony, Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the small island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income.Apple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.The previously undisclosed story of Apple\u2019s search for a new tax haven and its use of Jersey is among the findings emerging from a cache of secret corporate records from Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm that caters to businesses and the wealthy elite.The documents reveal how big law firms help clients weave their way through the gaps between different countries\u2019 tax rules. Appleby clients have transferred trademarks, patent rights and other valuable assets into offshore shell companies, avoiding billions of dollars in taxes. The rights to Nike\u2019s Swoosh trademark, Uber\u2019s taxi-hailing app, Allergan\u2019s Botox patents and Facebook\u2019s social media technology have all resided in shell companies that listed as their headquarters Appleby offices in Bermuda and Grand Cayman, the records show.\u201cU.S. multinational firms are the global grandmasters of tax avoidance schemes that deplete not just U.S. tax collection but the tax collection of most every large economy in the world,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a former corporate tax adviser to such companies who is now a law professor at the University of Southern California.Indeed, tax strategies like the ones used by Apple \u2014 as well as Amazon, Google, Starbucks and others \u2014 cost governments around the world as much as $240 billion a year in lost revenue, according to a 2015 estimate by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The disclosures come on the heels of last week\u2019s proposals by Republican lawmakers to provide several new tax benefits for multinational companies, including cutting the federal corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. President Trump has said that American businesses are getting a bad deal under current rules.But the documents show how major American companies find creative ways to avoid paying anything close to 35 percent.Apple, for example, pays taxes at a small fraction of that rate on its offshore profits, according to calculations by The Times based on the company\u2019s securities filings. Apple reports that nearly 70 percent of its worldwide profits are earned offshore.An Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, declined to answer most questions about the company\u2019s tax strategy. He did say that Apple had told regulators \u2014 in the United States and Ireland and at the European Commission \u2014 about the reorganization of its Irish subsidiaries. \u201cThe changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cAt Apple we follow the laws, and if the system changes we will comply. We strongly support efforts from the global community toward comprehensive international tax reform and a far simpler system.\u201dIn prepared statements, Allergan, Facebook, Nike and Uber said they complied with tax regulations around the world.Congressional Republicans are also seeking to impose a 10 percent tax on some of the profits that American businesses say are earned offshore \u2014 half the rate they are proposing for profits in the United States. The lawmakers have also proposed another break, permitting multinationals to bring home more than $2.6 trillion stowed offshore at sharply reduced tax rates. Both proposals, critics say, would only create additional incentives for businesses like Apple to shift more profits into island hideaways.Appleby is a member of the global network of lawyers, accountants and bankers who set up or manage offshore companies and accounts for clients who want to avoid taxes or keep their finances a secret from authorities, business partners or even spouses. The firm did not respond to questions from The Times about its work for Apple or other companies.Tax authorities have challenged several of the offshore structures maintained by Appleby and Estera, a spinoff of the law firm\u2019s corporate services business. Nike won a fight over back taxes with the Internal Revenue Service a year ago; a similar dispute between the I.R.S. and Facebook is continuing.European regulators are trying to force countries including Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to collect back taxes from big companies that relied on offshore arrangements. Apple is being pursued for $14.5 billion in back taxes after European regulators ruled that its old tax structure amounted to illegal state aid from the Irish government.Since the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens. Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions \u2014 mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2014 now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the world\u2019s population.Criticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.In May 2013, the Senate\u2019s investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apple\u2019s tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared \u201ctax residency\u201d nowhere in the world.Under Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is \u201cmanaged and controlled\u201d abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax. By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.At the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there. The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.\u201cApple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,\u201d then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.Ireland\u2019s finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, at first defended his country\u2019s policies: \u201cI do not want to be the whipping boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.\u201d Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies. Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.But by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.At that time, Apple had accumulated $111 billion in offshore cash, mostly in its Irish subsidiaries. Billions of dollars in new profits poured into them each year. Yet they paid almost no corporate income tax.Company officials wanted to keep it that way. So Apple sought alternatives to the tax arrangement Ireland would soon shut down. And the officials wanted to be quiet about it.\u201cFor those of you who are not aware Apple are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,\u201d wrote Cameron Adderley, global head of Appleby\u2019s corporate department, in a March 20, 2014 email to other senior partners. \u201cThey also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.\u201dIn building Apple\u2019s new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor. A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago. The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax regulators. It has also fought international proposals for tax avoidance crackdowns.Baker McKenzie wanted to use a local Appleby office to maintain an offshore arrangement for Apple. For Appleby, Mr. Adderley said, this assignment was \u201ca tremendous opportunity for us to shine on a global basis with Baker McKenzie.\u201dBaker McKenzie\u2019s San Francisco office emailed a 14-item questionnaire in March 2014 to Appleby\u2019s offices in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey.\u201cConfirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities (such as board meetings, signing of important contracts) without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction,\u201d the document requested. Baker McKenzie also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: \u201cAre there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?\u201d(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, \u201cAs a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.\u201d)Apple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Appleby\u2019s office in Jersey, which is one of the Channel Islands and has strong links to the British banking system. Jersey makes its own laws and is not subject to most European Union legislation, making it a popular tax haven.But the plan to use Jersey faced a potential snag: In mid-2014, again under pressure from other governments, Irish ministers explored ending a tax shelter known as the \u201cdouble Irish,\u201d used by scores of companies, including the Appleby clients Allergan and Facebook, as well as Google, LinkedIn and other businesses.The double Irish allows companies to collect profits through one subsidiary that employs people in Ireland, then route those profits to an Irish mailbox subsidiary that is a tax resident of an offshore haven like Bermuda, Grand Cayman or the Isle of Man.Irish officials explored a ban on Irish companies claiming tax residency in tax havens. Executives at Allergan \u2014 which had used a double Irish for at least a decade, records show \u2014 tried to derail the rule change. Terilea Wielenga, then Allergan\u2019s head of tax, was also international president of the Tax Executives Institute, a trade group. She argued to the Irish finance ministry in July 2014 that any such changes should occur slowly.The campaign seemed to work. \u201cFor existing companies, there will be provision for a transition period until the end of 2020,\u201d Mr. Noonan declared in October 2014. The gradual phase-in would apply not just to existing companies but to any new ones created by December of that year.This gave Apple just enough time. By the end of the year, Jersey had become the new tax home of the Irish companies Apple Sales International and Apple Operations International.But a third Apple subsidiary, Apple Operations Europe, became resident in Ireland.Apple would not say why. But tax experts offer one possible reason. While media attention focused on Ireland\u2019s crackdown on the double Irish, officials announced a new measure: The country expanded its tax deductions for companies that move rights to intellectual property \u2014 like patents and trademarks \u2014 into Ireland. If an Irish company spent $15 billion buying such rights, even from a fellow subsidiary, it could claim a $1 billion tax deduction each year for 15 years.Apple declined to say whether it has availed itself of the new benefit.But J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova law professor and former I.R.S. official who reviewed the Appleby documents, concluded that there was a strong possibility the company moved intellectual property into Ireland to take advantage of the generous tax rules. Based on Apple\u2019s American securities filings, he estimated that the transfer was worth about $200 billion.That would mean that any income that Apple now generates in Ireland could be partially offset by more than $13 billion in tax deductions each year for 15 years.Apple\u2019s hunt for a tax haven is a familiar tale, said Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, who also reviewed the Appleby documents.\u201cThis is how it usually works: You close one tax shelter, and something else opens up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just goes on endlessly.\u201dSimon Bowers is a reporter for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Advertisement"}

That photo \u2014 the unconscious woman, the leering grin \u2014 is a weight Democrats shouldn\u2019t have to carry, given that they\u2019ve lately been insisting that it\u2019s disqualifying for a candidate to grab a woman sexually against her will. It seemed cruel to expect Democratic women to make Jesuitical arguments that the shadows under Franken\u2019s hands meant he wasn\u2019t really touching Tweeden\u2019s chest. Especially since, with a Democratic governor in Minnesota, the party would maintain control of Franken\u2019s seat.But even as I made the case for resignation, I was relieved that it seemed as if Franken might stick around, because I adore him as a public figure. It\u2019s easy to condemn morally worthless men like Trump; it\u2019s much harder to figure out what should happen to men who make valuable political and cultural contributions, and whose alleged misdeeds fall far short of criminal. Learning about all the seemingly good guys who do shameful things is what makes this moment, with its frenzied pace of revelations, so painful and confounding.Personally, I\u2019m torn by competing impulses. I want to see sexual harassment finally taken seriously but fear participating in a sex panic. My instinct is often to defend men I like, but I don\u2019t want to be an enabler or a sucker. I try not to be a hypocrite, while being aware that the right plays on the media\u2019s desire to seem fair-minded, which is part of what led to wildly excessive coverage of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails during the presidential campaign, among other distortions.It\u2019s not a coincidence that the post-Harvey Weinstein purge of sexual harassers has been largely confined to liberal-leaning fields like Hollywood, media and the Democratic Party. This isn\u2019t because progressive institutions are more sexist than others \u2014 I\u2019m confident there\u2019s at least as much sexual abuse in finance as in publishing. Rather, organizations with liberal values have suddenly become extremely responsive to claims of sexism. Feminists, enraged and traumatized by Donald Trump\u2019s election, know they can\u2019t expect accountability from Republicans, but they\u2019ve forced it from people who claim to share their ideals. As a result, it sometimes feels as if liberal institutions are devouring themselves over sex while conservatives, unburdened by the pretense of caring about gender equality, blithely continue their misrule.Adding to the confusion is the way so many different behaviors are being lumped together. Weinstein\u2019s sadistic serial predation isn\u2019t comparable to Louis C.K.\u2019s exhibitionism. The groping Franken has been accused of isn\u2019t in the same moral universe as Moore\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of minors. It seems perverse that Franken could be on his way out of the Senate while Moore might be on his way in.Yet just as there\u2019s a cost for cutting good but imperfect men loose, there\u2019s a cost to defending them from consequences we\u2019d demand if the politics were reversed. It forces feminists to treat our own standards as unrealistic, to undermine our own arguments. Ultimately, however these dilemmas play out, we lose: either the moral high ground or men whom we need, admire and maybe even love.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Worldwide Size Up Palace Intrigue in Oil-Rich Kingdom", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust two weeks ago, Saudi Arabia gathered the global business elite in Riyadh, promising a new age for the oil-rich kingdom as it sought to court overseas money and investment.International investors and business executives are now trying to interpret the power play.To some, the arrests portend a quick consolidation of authority under the young, reformist Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who wants to vault the country to modernity. In that way, the arrests are viewed as a sign that the crown prince will be able to push through his ambitious economic agenda, including selling off shares in the giant state oil company.To others, the arrests point to the potential for political tumult that could lead to the collapse of his entire project. Overseas investors have been reluctant to plow money into a country where the rule of law is weak and the ruling family trumps all.\u201cIt might have good consequences for stability maybe, or just the opposite,\u201d said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, an oil service company that does business across the Middle East and North Africa. \u201cIt\u2019s questionable what is happening behind the scenes, it is a very secretive society.\u201dThe arrests came at an awkward time for the kingdom.Despite the goodwill, few had backed the effort with time and money. And the weekend\u2019s arrests could add to that reluctance. But they could also change some perceptions, if the crown prince can eventually show a broader commitment to shaking up an entrenched royal bureaucracy.\u201cI think this is going to slow things down, but if the gambit is successful it will help,\u201d said Charif Souki, chairman of Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas company now attempting to make energy deals with Saudi Arabia. Speaking of Crown Crown Prince Mohammed, he said, \u201cOnce he has consolidated power, he will do what he wants to do, which is to modernize the country and modernize Islam, which are all good things. But it might be very dangerous and it might not work.\u201dEven before the arrests, investors didn\u2019t quite know what to make of the kingdom.The crown prince and his father, King Salman, have also won praise from local and international business leaders for their promises to return the kingdom to the kind of religious moderation that was more prevalent before a period of religious and sectarian unrest in 1979, when the royal family began to rely on conservative Islamic clerics to guarantee stability. They have had the temerity to take on the religious police and begin rolling back some social policies.But Saudi Arabia has also faced unusual turbulence, complete with the sacking of two crown princes, a costly war in Yemen and a confrontation with Qatar. The weak price of oil has amplified the financial stress in the kingdom. The government has been forced to cut benefits for highly paid civil servants.There remains a great deal of skepticism that the economic re-engineering can be pulled off, in part because much of the royal family and old guard have been made rich from payments by Saudi Aramco, whose books are essentially closed to the public. That is one reason there is growing talk that the Saudis will eventually turn to China, rather than the London or New York stock exchanges, to get around Western regulators and raise capital for Saudi Aramco.\u201cI don\u2019t see them get investor interest unless they can produce a set of financial books that have been audited to Western accounting standards,\u201d said Nancy T. Schmitt, president of Taum Sauk Investments, a firm based in New York that specializes in energy. \u201cIf this is a step to getting to that, then this is a good thing. But I don\u2019t know that because I can\u2019t read the palace intrigue.\u201dThe arrests just make it harder to sort through the business climate.Some interpreted the arrests as being disturbingly arbitrary. One of the officials arrested was the former Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a Saudi Aramco board member. Another was Adel Fakieh, an early drafter of the crown prince\u2019s reforms, who was ousted from his post of economy minister earlier Saturday.\u201cI don\u2019t think it sends a particularly good signal to investors,\u201d said Rachel Ziemba, managing director for emerging markets at Roubini Global Economics, a research firm in New York.There is another school of thought among business leaders and analysts that the arrests were part of an effort to make the Saudi Aramco offering and other reforms unstoppable. In that way, it would be the sort of proof that the crown prince has the power to get his agenda done.\u201cThis is just the kind of determination and commitment that is called for,\u201d said Sadad al-Husseini, former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco.Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, who attended the Riyadh conference, was somewhat more circumspect. \u201cDoes this scare off a pension fund or can this be sold as creating the necessary conditions of success?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-stakes game.\u201dKate Kelly contributed reporting from New York and Stanley Reed from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Very Frustrated\u2019 Trump Becomes Top Critic of Law Enforcement", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe repeated assaults on law enforcement cross lines that presidents have largely observed since the Watergate era, raising questions about the separation of politics and the law. But as extraordinary as Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides are, perhaps more striking is that investigators and prosecutors are so far ignoring the head of the executive branch in which they serve while military judges and juries are for the most part disregarding the opinions of their commander in chief.Mr. Trump has made clear that he sees the attorney general and the F.B.I. director as his personal agents rather than independent figures, lashing out at both for not protecting him from the Russia investigation.While his lawyers have for now persuaded Mr. Trump not to publicly attack Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, the president has not ruled out firing him, a scenario that other presidents facing special prosecutors considered virtually unthinkable. Asked on Friday whether he might fire Mr. Sessions if the attorney general does not investigate Democrats, Mr. Trump left open the prospect: \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.The president\u2019s Twitter posts and comments drew rebukes from Democrats and some Republicans. Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who served for six years under President Barack Obama, said Mr. Trump\u2019s comments make the job of law enforcement officials more difficult.\u201cCombined with his improper attempts to influence Department of Justice actions, this demonstrates that he is a president who is willing to flout those norms that protect the rule of law,\u201d Mr. Holder said in an interview.Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican who has broken with Mr. Trump, said the Justice Department should be free of political interference.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s pressuring of the Justice Department and F.B.I. to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate and not only undermine our justice system but erode the American people\u2019s confidence in our institutions,\u201d he said.Some conservatives defended Mr. Trump\u2019s right to exercise oversight of the country\u2019s law enforcement agencies, saying that it would be dangerous to have an attorney general and an F.B.I. director who were not answerable to elected leaders.However, Mr. Rivkin added, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you exercise your authority to direct those things in a crude and obscene fashion. You have to exercise some politesse about it.\u201dOther presidents have been criticized for political intervention when they spoke out about continuing criminal cases. Peter J. Wallison, who was the White House counsel under Reagan, said his president at times spoke out on cases of interest, including the investigation of Reagan\u2019s onetime adviser Michael K. Deaver.\u201cI would try to discourage him, for all the good reasons people in the White House are probably trying to discourage Trump, but it was to no avail,\u201d Mr. Wallison said. \u201cTrump is doing the same, except to a greater extent.\u201dBut in the past four decades, no president has sought to publicly pressure law enforcement as much as Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019m really not involved with the Justice Department,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters before leaving on a 12-day trip to Asia. \u201cI\u2019d like to let it run itself. But honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats. They should be looking at Podesta and all of that dishonesty. They should be looking at a lot of things. And a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s own outspokenness may have helped lead to the very result he was condemning. The judge did not explain his reasoning on Friday but last week said he would consider the president\u2019s past comments as evidence for a lighter sentence.Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting.Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt @esullivannyt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ahead of Vote, Promised Treasury Analysis of Tax Bill Proves Elusive", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In pitching the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has said repeatedly that the plan will pay for itself through a surge of economic growth and that over 100 people in Treasury are \u201cworking around the clock on running scenarios for us.\u201dMr. Mnuchin has promised that Treasury will release its analysis in full. Yet, as the full Senate prepares to vote on a sweeping tax rewrite, the administration has yet to produce the type of economic analysis that it is citing as a reason to pass the tax cut.Those inside Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Policy, which Mr. Mnuchin has credited with running the models, say they have been largely shut out of the process and are not working on the type of detailed analysis that he has mentioned. An economist at the Office of Tax Analysis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize his job, said Treasury had not released a \u201cdynamic\u201d analysis showing that the tax plan would be paid for with economic growth because one did not exist.Instead of conducting full analyses of tax proposals, staff members have been running numbers on individual provisions or policy ideas, like lowering the tax rate on so-called pass-through businesses and figuring out how many family farms would benefit from the repeal of the estate tax. Activity has picked up more recently as Treasury has sought to provide technical assistance to the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office for their estimates.On Thursday, the Treasury\u2019s inspector general said it was opening an inquiry into the department\u2019s analysis of the tax plan. The inquiry was in response to a request from Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who called for the inspector general to investigate political meddling in the tax policy office after The New York Times reported on the lack of a Treasury analysis.\u201cEither the Treasury Department has used extensive taxpayer funds to conduct economic analyses that it refuses to release because those analyses would contradict the Treasury secretary\u2019s claims, or Secretary Mnuchin has grossly misled the public about the extent of the Treasury Department\u2019s analysis,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote in a letter to the agency\u2019s watchdog. \u201cI am deeply concerned about either possibility.\u201dThe lack of any formal assessment of the bills\u2019 economic effect from the administration came as Republicans barreled ahead with a plan that was expected to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit at a time when the federal debt has already topped $20 trillion. Deficit hawks, including lawmakers like Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, have been asking for analyses that show how the plan would avoid ballooning the deficit, which reached $666 billion, or 3.5 percent of gross domestic product, for fiscal 2017.The Trump administration could come under renewed pressure this week to justify its claims about the economic growth and revenue that it says the Republican tax plans would create. The Joint Committee on Taxation released an analysis on Thursday that found the Senate tax plan would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade even when accounting for economic growth.Mr. Mnuchin, in an interview in October, said that he was prepared to rebut such differences.\u201cThere is certain things we\u2019ll agree with Joint Tax, there\u2019s certain things we won\u2019t necessarily agree with Joint Tax and we\u2019ll explain the differences,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe want complete visibility.\u201dThus far, such visibility has remained out of reach. The only detailed study of the Republican tax framework that the administration has released was a report published by the Council of Economic Advisers in October that asserted that the corporate tax cut proposal would increase average household income by at least $4,000 a year.A spokeswoman for the council said that no additional analyses of the tax bills were currently in the works. A spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget said that he was unaware of any new reports from the agency about the economic impact of the tax bills.The lack of information means that some lawmakers who have long criticized exacerbating the deficit are left making a big decision in the dark.Mr. Corker said that Treasury Department officials told him last week that he would be provided with a Treasury analysis before the full Senate considered the bill. But he said this week that Treasury was unable to deliver on that promise when officials met with him on Monday to assuage his concerns about the cost of the Senate tax cuts.\u201cI don\u2019t know, I think they still have some work to do,\u201d Mr. Corker said in an interview, when asked about the promised analysis. \u201cThey came over, had a very nice meeting, but there\u2019s no modeling yet.\u201dVeterans of previous Treasury Departments also expressed concern. Paul O\u2019Neill, the first Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, said that he considered conducting a dynamic score ahead of the 2001 tax cuts, but ultimately stuck with a traditional analysis that did not make projections about the effects on economic growth. Mr. O\u2019Neill said that he was dumbfounded by the notion that the tax cuts working their way through Congress would not add to the debt.\u201cThe whole thing seems astounding to me,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThe idea that after the most recently completed fiscal year where we had a $660 billion deficit we\u2019re talking about a big tax cut.\u201dIn 2006, Mr. Bush\u2019s Treasury Department did a dynamic analysis of the effects of making his tax cuts permanent, and the results undercut some of the arguments about the merits of such a move.The lack of an economic analysis comes during tension between the Treasury\u2019s political appointees and the career tax experts in the Office of Tax Analysis. According to current and former employees of the department and the people who know them, the career employees have been largely shut out of the process.\u201cThese people are dyed-in-the-wool bureaucrats; they are passionate about it, and to kind of have their views disregarded, I don\u2019t think any of them have really seen it to this degree,\u201d said Austin Frerick, an economist at the Office of Tax Analysis who left in May to run for Congress as a Democrat in Iowa. \u201cThat\u2019s where the frustration comes.\u201dThe angst among the career employees in the department began to bubble up earlier this year, Mr. Frerick said, when Treasury\u2019s political appointees started to press to remove a 2012 research paper that contradicted the administration\u2019s views about how much corporate tax cuts would lead to wage growth. According to Mr. Frerick, the discussions sometimes grew tense to the point that James Mackie, the director of the Office of Tax Analysis and a longtime Treasury employee, would leave the office visibly upset.\u201cHe was mad about it,\u201d said Mr. Frerick, who used to sit next to Mr. Mackie. \u201cHe left the discussions very frustrated.\u201dMr. Mackie, who declined to comment, recently announced that he would retire from Treasury by the year\u2019s end.\u201cI am departing with very mixed feelings,\u201d Mr. Mackie wrote in an email to his colleagues announcing his departure after 32 years at Treasury to take a job at Ernst and Young. \u201cThese are thick cords to cut. But it\u2019s time.\u201dMr. Mnuchin, for his part, offers frequent public praise for Treasury\u2019s tax staff on the effort to rewrite the tax code, and he has played down the removal of the paper in question as an obvious decision.\u201cTo the extent that there was something that was completely inconsistent with what we\u2019re publishing now, we thought it made sense to take down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hide the fact that we took it off.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the timing of a photograph of Steven Mnuchin. It was taken in November, not this month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Tilt Toward Congestion Pricing Was Years in the Making", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "For decades, the plan to reduce traffic by charging drivers in crowded zones in Manhattan has been revived again and again.Supported byIt is the Lazarus of congestion plans: reduce traffic in New York City by charging drivers in crowded areas at peak traffic times.This time congestion pricing is back at a moment of crisis \u2014 above ground, streets are becoming increasingly snarled in large part because of the boom in ride-hailing apps, while below ground the problem is even worse as the city\u2019s aging subway system is riddled with delays and in dire need of money. The state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subway, faces a litany of problems, including antiquated signals and overcrowded cars, that have led to frequent breakdowns \u2014 much of it documented by smartphone-toting commuters for the world to see.Congestion pricing \u201cnever really went away\u201d said Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University, noting that \u201cit has an intrinsic appeal \u2014 a single solution that raises revenue, improves our environment and reduces congestion.\u201dThey each have their strengths. Mr. Schwartz, 69, a former city traffic commissioner known as \u201cGridlock Sam,\u201d is the irrepressible traffic engineer who is helping shape the discussion on congestion pricing as a member of the state task force. Mr. Matthiessen, 53, a former president of Riverkeeper, an environmental advocacy group, is the political strategist, founder and director of Move NY.Mr. Komanoff, 70, a policy analyst and a former president of Transportation Alternatives, is the one who made congestion pricing more than just an idea by creating a spreadsheet model to calculate the real-life impacts, including how much money would be raised, how much traffic would be reduced and how the costs would be spread across the region.Together, they are the \u201cthree amigos\u201d \u2014 as Mr. Schwartz puts it \u2014 behind congestion pricing.\u201cThey\u2019ve played an invaluable role of maintaining the ongoing discourse on congestion pricing,\u201d said Scott Rechler, chairman of the Regional Planning Association, an influential urban policy group, and another member of the state task force.The three men, working separately at first, dissected the Bloomberg plan to find out what went wrong. That plan had sought to establish a congestion zone in Manhattan, south of 60th Street, and charge drivers an $8 flat fee to enter during peak commuting times. Drivers who do not want to pay would presumably stay away. It faltered in Albany despite the support of Gov. David A. Paterson, who had just taken office after Eliot L. Spitzer resigned amid a sex scandal.Kathryn Wylde, the president and chief executive officer of the Partnership for New York City, a group of top business leaders that backed the Bloomberg plan, said it had not been the right time, with a new governor still getting his bearings, to try to pass a controversial congestion pricing plan. Ms. Wylde recalled that the plan had drawn wide opposition, including from some state legislators who drove to their offices in Manhattan. One assemblyman told Ms. Wylde at the time, \u201cYou\u2019re going to cost me $8 a day.\u201dMs. Wylde, who is also on the state task force, added that when it came to congestion pricing, \u201cEverything is personal. No one wants to pay.\u201dMr. Schwartz mapped out the political opposition, finding a crescent-shaped area of resistance running along eastern Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. Then he went on his own version of a listening tour \u2014 meeting with critics to hear their concerns and seeking ways to make the idea more palatable.One frequent criticism of the Bloomberg plan was that Manhattan reaped the benefits of congestion pricing while the other boroughs bore the costs. So Mr. Schwartz, who proposed a toll system for the East River bridges, came up with a \u201ctoll swap:\u201d as new tolls were added to the bridges, existing tolls would be lowered on other bridges linking areas with few subway and transit alternatives, such as the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge linking Brooklyn and Staten Island. He also proposed that part of the revenue raised from congestion pricing be reserved for roads and bridges to benefit drivers instead of all going to public transit.They developed their own congestion pricing plan, which included Mr. Schwartz\u2019s toll swap and revenue for roads and bridges. To address the surge in Uber and other ride-hail-app services, they also proposed adding per-mile and per-minute surcharges to fares for cabs and other for-hire vehicles in Manhattan south of 96th Street, which was intended to improve traffic flow in heavily congested business areas.\u201cMy thought was over time, opposition would soften more as people learned about the benefits,\u201d Mr. Matthiessen said. \u201cIt\u2019s just really getting people comfortable with the idea. No one likes change.\u201dKendra Hems, president of the Trucking Association of New York, an industry group that opposed the Bloomberg plan, said she became more open to congestion pricing as a result of Move NY. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to have discussions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just outright opposed to the idea. We just want to make sure there\u2019s a benefit that comes back to the industry.Still, many hurdles remain and any plan would ultimately have to win the support of the State Legislature. David I. Weprin, a Democratic assemblyman from Queens, said that while he liked the men behind congestion pricing, he would continue to oppose any toll on the East River bridges. \u201cThere are very few things that are free in New York City and this is one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see that change.\u201dAnd Mr. Moss, of New York University, believes that congestion pricing would not be sufficient by itself to finance essential subway improvements. \u201cWe have to be wary of any one solution for a problem this complex,\u201d he said.\u201dThe Move NY campaign has had some successes, culminating with state legislators introducing bills in 2016 in both houses based on its congestion plan. But that effort did not get far. Funding dried up and the group had to lay off its staff of two.\u201cWe were hemorrhaging supporters,\u201d Mr. Schwartz recalled. \u201cJust about everybody thought it was a lost cause. I never give up and never will. I was self-financing my own efforts. But Alex and Charlie were dependent on grants and it looked very gloomy. If I lost them I\u2019d still be on my soapbox but it would be pretty lonely.\u201dBut then as the subway crisis deepened this summer, Mr. Cuomo brought congestion pricing to the forefront. Move NY mobilized again. Mr. Matthiessen recalled that even in the beginning, he had thought it might take a transit crisis to push congestion pricing through Albany.Mr. Schwartz said that he is feeling upbeat but cautious about being so close after all these years.\u201cI haven\u2019t broken out the champagne bottle yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, I know where I keep the champagne.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Militant Leader Hafiz Saeed Is Released by Pakistani Court", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Saeed had long been one of the most-wanted militant leaders in the region, but he had been living in the open in Pakistan for years despite a $10 million American bounty on him. India, in particular, has criticized Pakistan for not bringing him to justice after the militant group he founded, Lashkar-e-Taiba, killed 166 people in the Mumbai attacks.But to many Pakistanis, Mr. Saeed is a hero: the architect of a long militant campaign to fight India in Kashmir, and a prominent voice for fundamentalist Islam. Some love how he has mocked efforts by the United States to capture him, and he drew large crowds as he continued to lead public gatherings, especially in his home city, Lahore.In January, the government declared him under house arrest, seeming to bow to international pressure and also keeping him from fund-raising for Jamaat-ud-Dawa. The arrest order was extended several times until Wednesday, when a three-member judicial body reviewed and rejected a government request to extend Mr. Saeed\u2019s detention for 90 more days. His current detention order expires overnight Thursday.\u201cWe are overjoyed to announce that after waiting for 10 long months, our chief will finally be free,\u201d Jamaat-ud-Dawa\u2019s information secretary, Nadeem Awan, said in an interview. \u201cThere is a lot of celebration and happiness within our ranks, and we are proud that we have been able to get justice the legal way, through the courts.\u201dMr. Awan said the government\u2019s lawyers had repeatedly argued in court that Mr. Saeed was a threat to public safety and that his release could lead to international penalties for Pakistan for not moving against terrorism financing.\u201cBut at no point was the government able to provide any actual evidence for these charges, despite the court giving it many chances to do so,\u201d Mr. Awan said.\u201cThe review board has now rescinded the detention order,\u201d said Mr. Saeed\u2019s lawyer, Abdullah Khan Dogar. \u201cThe government of Punjab is now bound to release Hafiz Saeed. They no longer have any right to keep him in custody.\u201dA Punjab government spokesman confirmed that the government was releasing Mr. Saeed, \u201cthough our concerns about his activities are far from resolved.\u201dHis latest stint under house arrest was not the first for Mr. Saeed, though he has repeatedly avoided long-term detention or serious legal charges. He was placed under detention at least twice after the 2008 attacks in Mumbai.For decades, Pakistan has cast a benign eye on groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba \u2014 which is perceived as an asset because its attacks target Indian soldiers in Kashmir \u2014 even as the government battles jihadist groups like the Pakistani Taliban that directly threaten the country.But despite its pressure on Pakistan to move against militants like Mr. Saeed, the United States has also sent mixed messages.Just a month ago, the United States Senate struck down a provision tying American government funding to Pakistan to the country\u2019s efforts to curb Lashkar-e-Taiba\u2019s operations. The provision, part of broader Pentagon-funding legislation that Congress introduced this past summer, would have forced the secretary of defense to certify that Islamabad was thwarting Lashkar-e-Taiba\u2019s activities inside Pakistan or risk $350 million in American assistance.Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, said military aid to Pakistan was a continuing source of tension between the Pentagon and Congress.\u201cIt astounds me that we keep giving Pakistan money \u2014 military and foreign aid \u2014 and they\u2019re a haven for terror groups, from the Taliban to Lashkar-e-Taiba,\u201d Mr. Poe said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cThe military folks over the years have not made the case to me that we should continue military support to Pakistan.\u201dPresident Trump has been publicly critical of Pakistan\u2019s role in the region, announcing a South Asia strategy in August that called out Pakistan for giving \u201csafe haven\u201d to terrorist groups. He vowed to strengthen the United States\u2019 relationship with India instead.\u201cWe can\u2019t buy Pakistan\u2019s loyalty,\u201d Mr. Poe said. \u201cThey play everyone, whether it\u2019s China or the terrorists or us.\u201dIn India, the response to the Pakistani court ruling was outrage.The media organization India Today ran a banner headline on its news channel saying that \u201cjihad over justice\u201d had prevailed. Gaurav C.

{"Headline": "Why the Greek Bailout Went So Wrong", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Short of leaving the euro, a move with no precedent or procedure and a high risk of cascading chaos, this was not an option for Greece. So in May 2010, the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund stepped in with what was characterized as a 110 billion euro ($146 billion at the time) bailout.\u201cFiscal waterboarding\u201d is the name that the University of Athens economist Yanis Varoufakis gave to this process, after the torture method that simulates near-drowning again and again. And just as intelligence experts generally don\u2019t think waterboarding is an effective way to extract information, it is hard to find an outside economic or financial expert who thinks the troika\u2019s Greece policy has been effective or sensible.So why has it continued? This is the most important question Varoufakis sets out to answer in this account of the six months he spent as Greece\u2019s finance minister in 2015. \u201cAdults in the Room\u201d is several things: a gripping tale of an outspoken intellectual\u2019s sudden immersion in high-stakes politics, an at times overwrought riposte to the many people in and outside Greece who derided his efforts and a solid work of explanatory economics. Most of all, though, it is an attempt to divine why smart, seemingly decent politicians and bureaucrats would continue pushing a pointlessly cruel approach long after its pointlessness had become clear. The book\u2019s subtitle (\u201cMy Battle With the European and American Deep Establishment\u201d) might lead a reader to expect all manner of sinister machinations. But while there are a few internal Greek political plots that can be fairly described as conspiracies, at the international level it\u2019s mainly what Varoufakis calls \u201can authentic drama \u2026 reminiscent of a play by Aeschylus or Shakespeare in which powerful schemers end up caught in a trap of their own making.\u201dAt the outset of the narrative, the former United States Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers asks Varoufakis in a dimly lit hotel bar in Washington, D.C., whether he is an \u201cinsider\u201d or \u201coutsider,\u201d warning that outsiders (those who \u201cprioritize their freedom to speak their version of the truth\u201d) tend to have a hard time getting anything accomplished in government.Varoufakis was and is obviously an outsider. He had made his name with colorful critiques of Greek and European economic policies. Even as he allied himself with Alexis Tsipras and his leftist Syriza Party to run for office in January 2015, he didn\u2019t actually join the party. And once in office he continued to behave in ways that finance ministers aren\u2019t supposed to, tooling around Athens on his Yamaha XJR motorcycle and famously showing up for a meeting on Downing Street in a too-tight, too-bright blue shirt and a leather overcoat described by one British fashion writer as a \u201cdrug dealer\u2019s coat.\u201dThat bold fashion statement, Varoufakis recounts, was unintentional \u2014 the result of leaving his suitcase in a cab in Athens two days before. Arriving in Paris on a Saturday evening after most stores had closed, he had to make do with a couple of shirts from Zara and a coat borrowed from the Greek ambassador to France.Varoufakis had hoped to engineer an orderly bankruptcy for Greece within the euro, with the country\u2019s debts significantly reduced and austerity scaled back. Failing that, though, he was willing to pull Greece out of the euro and go the sovereign-debt-crisis route.The German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the dominant figure in European financial affairs, openly favored the latter course. His harsh but not entirely unreasonable view was that it had been a mistake to let Greece into the eurozone, and that the only way forward was for Greece to leave. Chancellor Angela Merkel, on the other hand, was unwilling to contemplate a \u201cGrexit\u201d that might lead to an unraveling of the common currency. But she was also unwilling or unable to force Sch\u00e4uble to offer a better deal to Greece. The result, as Varoufakis writes: \u201cStalemate!\u201d Reinforcing the stalemate was what Varoufakis calls the \u201ceurozone runaround,\u201d the repeated protestations from officials at the E.C., E.C.B. and I.M.F. that, while they sympathized with Greece\u2019s plight and agreed with many of Varoufakis\u2019s recommendations, they alone couldn\u2019t change the troika\u2019s course. Jack Lew, then the United States Treasury secretary, similarly offered sympathetic words but made clear that he had no interest in crossing the Germans. The end finally came in July 2015, when \u2014 right after 61 percent of Greek voters decided to reject the latest \u201cbailout\u201d from the troika \u2014 a fearful Tsipras chose nonetheless to submit. Varoufakis resigned after that.Varoufakis does a magnificent job of evoking the absurdities and frustrations of his tenure. This is what it\u2019s like to go from meeting to interminable meeting for six months, trying and failing to negotiate your country\u2019s way out of a terrible impasse.At least, this is what Varoufakis says it was like. I did wonder on occasion how much I could trust his play-by-play. I\u2019m reviewing this book, not fact-checking it, but I couldn\u2019t resist asking Summers for his assessment of the opening scene in the hotel bar. \u201cSomewhat embellished,\u201d was the verdict. Leaving aside whether Varoufakis\u2019s recollections might be more accurate than those of a man who has met with so many embattled finance ministers over the past quarter century that he has probably lost count, I\u2019m good with that. A truth somewhat embellished is still pretty much the truth.An earlier version of this review misspelled the surname of the Greek prime minister. He is Alexis Tsipras, not Sipras.Justin Fox is a columnist for Bloomberg View and the author of \u201cThe Myth of the Rational Market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Bribery Case Sheds Light on Mysterious Chinese Company", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPatrick Ho flew to New York in fall 2014. His intention, according to the Justice Department, was to bribe African officials on behalf of a private Chinese conglomerate with global ambitions and enormous wealth.In meetings at the United Nations, Mr. Ho, a former Hong Kong civil servant, laid the groundwork for millions of dollars of payments to the president of Chad and Uganda\u2019s foreign minister in exchange for oil rights in the two countries, federal prosecutors say.The complaint does not name the Chinese company Mr. Ho represented, but the specifics of the case make clear the company\u2019s identity: CEFC China Energy Company.Details outlined by the Justice Department reveal the innovative tactics the company pursued to secure coveted oil rights in Chad and Uganda through its nonprofit think tank in Hong Kong. Mr. Ho was an executive at the nonprofit.CEFC has risen suddenly from a little known Chinese company to a major player in the global energy business, with investments in Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. In September, the Chinese conglomerate took a $9 billion stake in Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant and a subject of sanctions by the United States.CEFC has played to China\u2019s geopolitical ambitions. It is among a small number Chinese companies to receive Beijing\u2019s approval to chase splashy deals at a time when the government has mostly restricted overseas acquisitions. The investments have largely meshed with China\u2019s strategy to court other countries through infrastructure and energy investment.Chinese businesses like CEFC are increasingly mixing money with diplomacy as they scour the world to secure valuable natural resources. The criminal complaint against Mr. Ho shows how the practice can be distorted, offering rare insight into a vast, mysterious conglomerate with ties to the Chinese Communist Party.CEFC provides all of the financing for the China Energy Fund Committee, a Hong Kong research organization. The conglomerate\u2019s founder, Ye Jianming, is listed as a chairman on the think tank\u2019s website.Through Mr. Ho, the think tank brokered the approaches to officials in Chad and Uganda, prosecutors say. Details included in the complaint about the company and think tank were confirmed by news releases from the CEFC\u2019s website.In a statement, CEFC disputed the allegations. It said it was \u201chighly concerned\u201d about the action taken against Mr. Ho, a former home affairs secretary in Hong Kong, and added that the think tank did not \u201cget involved in business activities of CEFC.\u201dCEFC has emerged from obscurity in recent years as a major player in the China\u2019s plans for a modern day Silk Road, scooping up businesses in the oil, travel and financial industries in the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, Spain and the Middle East. Along the way, it has grown into a behemoth with revenue of nearly $40 billion in 2015, according to corporate disclosures.Mr. Ye, who was 25 when he started the company, has been both a corporate leader and a diplomatic envoy of sorts, posing for photographs with leaders like President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, and President Idriss D\u00e9by of Chad. He has also met with Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, and Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman.His think tank holds special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. According to its website, it has organized conferences \u201con world civilizations to explore common ethics\u201d that have featured senior American military officials and Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army generals.In China, CEFC has become a prominent corporate player. Its oil storage facilities in Hainan Province are leased to the state-owned giant ChemChina as part of the country\u2019s strategic reserves. The company also has joint ventures with the state-backed China State Shipbuilding, China Railway and Guangdong Material Reserve Administration. The Communist Youth League, which has long bred new generations of party leaders, is listed as a part of the CEFC management that oversees strategy.CEFC has sought major oil deals outside China, playing a major role in President Xi Jinping\u2019s One Belt One Road initiative to bring developing countries on China\u2019s periphery closer to its orbit through infrastructure projects.In September, CEFC agreed to take the stake in Rosneft. In October, Chan Chauto, the company\u2019s president, met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at an investment forum in Moscow.CEFC also has a joint venture with Kazakhstan\u2019s national oil company, KazMunayGas International, which has given it access to a network of oil and gas terminals in Europe.It was the company\u2019s pursuit of oil rights in Africa that attracted the Justice Department\u2019s attention.Mr. Ho met Mr. Gadio, a former foreign minister in Senegal, at the United Nations with a proposition, according to the complaint filed in Manhattan. CEFC wanted to expand its oil operations into Chad, and to do so with CNPC, a state-owned Chinese company facing a $1.2 billion fine in Chad for environmental violations.The pledge was intended to influence the government to give CEFC the exclusive rights to certain oil blocks, federal prosecutors say. In the end, the company acquired other oil rights from a Taiwanese company. But Chad\u2019s fine against CNPC was ultimately lowered to $400 million, and CEFC is in talks to develop an oil project in the country with CNPC, according to the CEFC website. Mr. Ho is accused of paying Mr. Gadio $400,000 for his services.In a statement, CEFC said its deal with the Taiwanese company was a \u201cfinancial investment in Chad\u201d that did not involve any other \u201cinterest\u201d from the country\u2019s government.Edward Y. Kim, Mr. Ho\u2019s lawyer, declined to comment. Robert Baum, a lawyer for Mr. Gadio, said that his client\u2019s \u201cintegrity and honesty have never been questioned. The current charges do not reflect the decades of work he has admirably and capably performed.\u201dAround the time that Mr. Ho met with Mr. Gadio, he also initiated contact with Uganda\u2019s foreign minister, Sam Kutesa, according to the complaint. Mr. Kutesa had just become president of the United Nations General Assembly, according to the Justice Department. Over the course of a year, the two struck up a friendship, the complaint says.By 2015, Mr. Kutesa, in his General Assembly role, had appointed Mr. Ye as a \u201cspecial honorary adviser,\u201d officials said.When Mr. Kutesa returned to his position as Uganda\u2019s foreign minister, he solicited a payment from Mr. Ho in the form of a donation for a charitable foundation that he planned to launch, according to the Justice Department. The payment was actually in exchange for oil contracts, according to U.S. officials. Mr. Ho wired $500,000 into a bank account designated by Mr. Kutesa, who is not charged in the criminal complaint.The Ugandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a request for comment. CEFC said it had no investment in Uganda.Two weeks after the complaint says the money was wired, Mr. Kutesa\u2019s wife sent a note to Mr. Ho, expressing the couple\u2019s thanks to Mr. Ye of CEFC.\u201cLet me seize this opportunity,\u201d she wrote, \u201cto convey our gratitude to the chairman for his contribution to our foundation.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research from Shanghai.

Its maverick crew of hackers, anarchists and futurists proved unable, and unwilling, to find a way to join the governing coalition. Bright Future, a hipsterish coalition party from the previous government, failed to live up to its name, having lost all its seats. A year ago, both parties had been seen as fresh alternatives.At the news conference, the previous prime minister, Bjarni Benediktsson, struck an upbeat note. \u201cAll Icelanders will enjoy the benefits of this agreement, both with regards to social security and general prosperity,\u201d he said.Mr. Benediktsson, whose Independence Party has featured in nearly every government since Iceland broke away from Danish rule in 1944, joined the new government as finance minister.Her party also called for the adoption of a new Constitution partly crowdsourced through social media. She, like her party, opposed Iceland\u2019s continued membership in NATO.Politics in Iceland have been mired in scandal since the financial crisis that began in 2008. But some observers said they hoped that the broad-based coalition could bolster stability in the wake of a resounding economic recovery: A tourism boom has driven unemployment down to almost zero.\u201cShe is the party leader who can best unite voters from the left and right,\u201d said Eva H. Onnudottir, a political scientist at the University of Iceland. \u201cBecause this coalition includes parties from the left to the right, their work will be more about managing the system instead of making \u2018revolutionary\u2019 changes. This could work quite well as long as the economy is stable and prosperous.\u201dMs. Onnudottir said she doubted that the adoption of a social media-driven Constitution would occur under this government. Both the Progressives and the Independence Party have strongly resisted the notion of a new Constitution in the past.Ms. Jakobsdottir also stressed on Thursday the importance of gender equality, vowed further steps to counter climate change and expressed a willingness to have Iceland take in more refugees.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Key European Agencies Move to Continent, Signs of Brexit\u2019s Toll", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritical agencies that oversee Europe\u2019s banks and pharmaceutical sector will move from London to cities on the Continent, political leaders in Brussels decided Monday, potentially ominous harbingers of how Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union could diminish the country\u2019s economic clout.The departure of the European Medicines Agency, Europe\u2019s equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, is a blow to the prestige of Britain\u2019s pharmaceutical industry, an important pillar of the economy and an example of the country\u2019s bona fides in scientific research and development.The European Banking Authority has strong symbolic value among cities jostling to become Continental Europe\u2019s financial capital. Its departure serves as a warning of the consequences of Brexit for London, currently the banking capital of Europe, and illustrates the fierce competition from other capitals for the spoils.\u201cThere is no upside for the City of London\u201d from Brexit, said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cIt will lose business, not gain.\u201dIts departure also underscores continuing questions about how British pharmaceutical companies will be regulated after the country\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc, known as Brexit, a shift scheduled for March 2019.The sector is an important one, and enjoys substantially more public support among Britons than finance, the image of which has been tarnished in recent years.Charles Tannock, a Conservative Party lawmaker in the European Parliament, described the relocation of the medicines agency on Twitter as a \u201chuge loss to UK pharma,\u201d adding that he was \u201cheart broken\u201d to lose the organization.\u201cThe relocation of the E.M.A. away from London will be a bitter pill to swallow,\u201d added Rory Palmer, the health policy spokesman for the opposition Labour Party\u2019s lawmakers in the European Parliament. \u201cOur economy will suffer. Our health sector will suffer. Our successful pharmaceutical industry will suffer.\u201cBut most of all, patients will suffer, from delays and the potential loss of access to medicines and research, if we are to crash out of the E.U.,\u201d Mr. Palmer said in a statement, referring to the possibility that Britain might quit the bloc without an agreement to stay within European regulatory structures.Before the discussion on relocation, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, wished all the candidates to host the agencies luck but added on Twitter: \u201cWhatever the outcome, the real winner of today\u2019s vote is EU27. Organized and getting ready for #Brexit.\u201dCompared with the European Medicines Agency, the banking authority is a minnow in size, with only about 150 employees.The decision to move the European Banking Authority, though, underlines the risks facing London\u2019s lucrative financial industry from Brexit. The European Central Bank has suggested it might impose extra regulations on eurozone banks operating in London, in effect pressuring them to move to the Continent.After Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, for example, large numbers of transactions in euros would be taking place outside the reach of European regulators. London dominates currency and derivatives trading in Europe.The decision was a blow to Frankfurt, which is probably a more important financial center and is the home to the European Central Bank, but lacks Paris\u2019s charm or breadth of cultural and entertainment opportunities.Numerous big banks are already expanding on the Continent. Goldman Sachs will add employees in both Frankfurt and Paris, Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman of the investment bank, said in an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro published Sunday.Because of an editing error, a picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated where the European Medicines Agency is moving. The agency, currently based in London, is moving to Amsterdam, not Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Plan Would Raise Taxes on the Poor, a Report Says", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation said on Thursday that the latest version of the Senate tax bill would effectively raise taxes for lower-income Americans by 2021.The projections assume that repeal of the so-called individual mandate would result in many lower-income Americans choosing not to buy insurance, and thus not claim tax subsidies that help them defray the costs of health coverage.As a result, their total tax liability would rise.The committee\u2019s analysis also found that Americans earning $75,000 a year or less would also face large tax increases by 2027 because of the Senate\u2019s plan to allow individual tax cuts to expire at the end of 2025.The analysis reports on taxpayer liability by income group, not on an individual basis. Previous committee analyses have found that millions of tax filers, across income levels, could see tax increases under Republicans\u2019 tax proposals.Thursday\u2019s report prompted additional criticism from Democrats, who were already adamant that the tax bill would hurt middle- and lower-income Americans. Republicans dismissed the projections and said the figures were a mirage, not a real increase in the taxes individuals would owe to the federal government.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, called the development \u201castounding\u201d and warned that middle-class taxpayers would get \u201cclobbered\u201d under the latest Republican plan.\u201cWhen you\u2019re reaching for the cranberry sauce, Republicans are going be reaching for your pocketbooks to give handouts to multinational corporations,\u201d Mr. Wyden said during a Finance Committee meeting Thursday.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, said the appearance of a tax increase was only a result of arcane government score-keeping rules. Because people will no longer have to purchase health insurance, they may no longer receive tax credit subsidies for insurance that they do not purchase.\u201cWithout those credits, they see an overall uptick in their tax liability,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.The debate then devolved into an argument over what counts as an increase and the murkiness of government scoring, which Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, called \u201cridiculous.\u201dUninterested in letting go of numbers that supported his argument that the Republican tax plan was bad for the middle class, Mr. Wyden dismissed Mr. Toomey\u2019s concerns.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard a senator try to psychoanalyze a Joint Committee on Taxation table,\u201d he said.Mr. Toomey later released a table that the committee had prepared for him, showing the projected effects of the amended Senate bill excluding those related to the mandate repeal. That table projected tax cuts in every income bracket in 2023.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece, Looking to Move Past Bailouts, Unveils Ambitious Budget", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 The Greek government on Tuesday unveiled an ambitious draft budget for next year, the latest sign the country is making progress in its economic recovery after years of painful austerity and international bailouts.The government projected that the economy will grow 2.5 percent next year, after a 1.6 percent anticipated increase this year, a further sign of Greece\u2019s confidence as it looks to wean itself off the financial assistance it has relied on for the last eight years. Athens has also tapped international debt markets in recent months, indicating it is able to command the confidence of overseas investors.The 2018 budget also forecast a primary surplus \u2014 cash in the Treasury after expenses and before debt payments \u2014 of 2.4 percent this year, higher than the country\u2019s creditors anticipate.The budget \u201cwill mark the country\u2019s exit from a long period of macroeconomic adjustment,\u201d Greece\u2019s Finance Ministry said in a statement accompanying the proposed budget.The details of the budget will be scrutinized when representatives of the country\u2019s international creditors return to Athens this month, before it goes to a vote in Parliament on Dec. 22.There are doubts, however, over how realistic the government\u2019s forecasts are. This year\u2019s growth forecast of 1.6 percent has been revised down twice, from an original 2.7 percent. And figures released by the European Union\u2019s statistics service in September pointed to a shy recovery in Greece, with growth of 0.8 percent in the second quarter.Still, the budget highlights the stark difference between the challenge facing Greece in recent years and the one it must grapple with today.Greeks have suffered through years of austerity, including cuts to pensions and tax increases, slashing incomes by a third. Unemployment has skyrocketed in that time, leaving more than a quarter of the population jobless at the peak of the crisis in 2013.In the latest budget, however, unemployment is estimated to slide below 20 percent, a marked decline, though still the highest in the 19-nation eurozone.And while the budget itself lays out a series of new austerity measures, from increases in social security contributions to cuts to subsidies for heating oil, there is some additional spending for Greeks. The Finance Ministry pledged a payout averaging 483 euros, or about $570, for 1.4 million Greek households, just days after the country\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, promised \u20ac1.4 billion would be dedicated to Greeks on low incomes.Mr. Tsipras first came to power in 2015 as a leftist firebrand on a pledge to roll back austerity. But he reversed course after the country reached the brink of crashing out of the eurozone and signed Greece\u2019s third international bailout. Since then, he has introduced a series of belt-tightening measures in exchange for loans, but has always insisted that his ultimate aim is to lighten the burden on Greeks.He has also demanded relief from Greece\u2019s crippling debt burden, which is expected to stand at just under 180 percent of gross domestic product next year, according to the budget. The rate remains the highest in the eurozone and has prompted calls by European leaders and the International Monetary Fund for a restructuring, with talks on relief expected to begin the second half of next year.Advertisement"}

The money was taken from the agency\u2019s \u201cspecial operational funds,\u201d which were intended to finance undercover assignments and were not scrutinized by parliamentary or other outside auditors, prosecutors said.Lee Byung-ho, another former spy chief who served under Ms. Park, faced the same accusations. But a judge did not approve his arrest on Friday, saying Mr. Lee was not at risk of fleeing the country or trying to destroy evidence if he was free awaiting trial.Prosecutors planned to indict the three former spy chiefs on charges of misappropriating a total of $3.6 million from their agency\u2019s budgets and offering the money as bribes to Ms. Park when they were leading the agency between early 2013 and September of last year.Two of Ms. Park\u2019s presidential aides were arrested on Nov. 3 on charges of collecting the monthly payouts, delivered in cash in briefcases, from spy agents near the presidential office.Mr. Moon, a former opposition leader, came to power in May by winning a snap election called after Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment. He campaigned on the promise to eradicate the abuse of presidential power and other corrupt practices.The former spy chiefs have denied the bribery accusations, saying that they believed the payments were legal and that the money would be used for legitimate purposes. But their arrests further sullied the reputation of the National Intelligence Service.All succeeding governments have been accused of abusing the intelligence agency to help strengthen their grip on power. A handful of former directors of the agency have been convicted of corruption and abuse of official power, including illegally wiretapping the conversations of politicians and others. The former director Kim Jae-gyu was executed for assassinating Mr. Park in 1979.Recent presidents have all vowed to reform the National Intelligence Service, but the agency has been plagued by recurring scandals.On Tuesday, a former senior official of the agency was indicted on charges of arranging for big businesses to provide donations to right-wing civic groups that organized rallies in support of the conservative government of President Lee Myung-bak in 2011 to 2012. He was also accused of plotting to stop television and radio stations from hiring entertainers deemed unfriendly to the government.In August, Mr. Won, who served under former President Lee, was sentenced to four years in prison on charges of ordering a clandestine online campaign to help the 2012 election of Ms. Park, a fellow conservative.In the run-up to the December 2012 election, Mr. Won directed a secret team of psychological warfare officials of his agency to work with hired private bloggers on an online smear campaign against Ms. Park\u2019s political rivals, according to the prosecutors\u2019 indictment.In a related case, Kim Kwan-jin, who served as defense minister under Mr. Lee, was arrested on Saturday on charges of directing members of his military\u2019s cyberwarfare command to begin online operations similar to the intelligence agency\u2019s.Mr. Kim continued to serve as defense minister after Ms. Park\u2019s election and later became her top national security adviser.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of one of the companies from which former President Park Geun-hye is accused of collecting or demanding bribes.

(Just in Time for an Election.)", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s economy is on track for a full year of growth. Inflation is slowing. The central bank has been replenishing its reserves of hard currency.The country is finally emerging from a difficult recession, and the timing could not be better: President Vladimir V. Putin is running for re-election soon.Mr. Putin is widely expected to triumph in the March polls \u2014 there is no credible opposition, and he has levers of the state, from fiscal largess to official media outlets, at his disposal.Figures discussed on Friday at Mr. Putin\u2019s meeting with government and central bank officials showed strong consumer demand, a main driver of the growth. Retail sales for the month increased 3 percent compared with a year before, according to the state statistics service. The Finance Ministry projects the overall economy to grow 2.1 percent for the year. That would be Russia\u2019s first full year of economic growth since a recession began in 2014.Other economic indicators have been trending in the same direction. Inflation is expected to be about 4 percent for 2017, low by recent Russian standards. As recently as 2015, official figures showed consumer prices were rising more than 15 percent, and ordinary Russians were feeling the pinch. The cost of Russian staples was rising: The price of bread, an important product because of its mythologized status in the Soviet period as a symbol of well being, increased about 11 percent a year during the recession, according to the state statistics agency.But as the price of oil, a major export commodity, has recovered from multiyear lows in 2014, Russia\u2019s central bank has resumed purchases of hard currency. It has been replenishing the reserves its uses to maintain the long-term stability of the ruble.\u201cIt\u2019s a broad recovery, and it will continue,\u201d said Vladimir Osakovsky, chief Russia economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cThere is strong fundamental support.\u201dThe country certainly faces challenges, Mr. Osakovsky and other analysts say. It remains vulnerable to swings in the price of oil and natural gas, for example. The two commodities account for about 60 percent of export revenue and 50 percent of the federal government\u2019s tax base, and a sudden drop in prices could expose wider issues with the economy.Experts also worry that Russia\u2019s banking system is vulnerable. The central bank had to nationalize two midsize private lenders this year, and several banks lost money betting against the ruble in recent years, according to Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Global Markets, an investment bank.\u201cSo far, the central bank has managed to keep the banking system working,\u201d Mr. Tikhomirov said. But, he added, \u201cthe cost of saving these banks is growing.\u201dStill, positive news has been trickling in.In September, Fitch, the credit rating agency, revised its outlook for Russian sovereign debt to positive from stable. Through the year, foreign investors have piled into Russian government bonds, raising the share of Russian debt held by foreigners to more than 30 percent, up from 5 percent.Also helping the recovery was government spending on major infrastructure projects, including a bridge across the Kerch Strait to Crimea, a major gas pipeline to China called the Power of Siberia, and soccer stadiums for the World Cup, which Russia will host next year.That has helped the country overcome Western sanctions imposed during the Ukraine crisis and over meddling by Moscow in the 2016 election in the United States. These \u201csmart sanctions\u201d were in any case narrowly targeting companies and businessmen aligned with Mr. Putin, meant to affect Kremlin insiders and not to slow the overall economy or hasten political change.Mr. Putin now finds himself in a more favorable economic environment before next year\u2019s election. And even though Russians have taken a considerable hit to their pocketbooks in recent years \u2014 real income, or wages adjusted for inflation, declined through the recession \u2014 he remains the overwhelming favorite. In an October survey conducted by the Levada Center, an independent polling organization, two-thirds of likely voters said they would cast their ballots for Mr. Putin.Spurring growth beyond the 2 percent region forecast by the government will not be easy, though.The country will very likely have to agree a series of major economic overhauls in order to bolster its long-term growth potential. The retirement age \u2014 currently 55 years for women and 60 years for men \u2014 will have to be raised, economists say. Without such changes, expansion will remain capped at its current levels, Russia\u2019s central bank chairwoman, Elvira S. Nabiullina, warned this month.\u201cWithout reform,\u201d Mr. Tikhomirov said, \u201cthe future for Russia will be fairly bleak.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Raising Interest Rates, Bank of England Issues \u2018Brexit\u2019 Warning", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cUncertainties associated with Brexit are weighing on domestic activity, which has slowed even as global growth has risen significantly,\u201d the bank declared. \u201cMonetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves toward its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over the next few years.\u201dCentral banking is a mysterious enterprise, not unlike a conclave of seers communicating by smoke signals from a mountain redoubt. Yet this message was strikingly clear: Britain is bound toward trouble, with only the extent of the damage yet to be determined.The rate hike surprised no one, having been telegraphed for weeks. The increase of the bank\u2019s lending rate from 0.25 percent to 0.50 appeared small enough that few expected it to pack substantial economic consequences. The bank presented it as a requisite attack on rising prices. But analysts saw another motive, an eagerness from the central bank to secure room to act again should the economy weaken: It raised rates so it could lower them if Britain requires a fresh jolt of stimulus.Now, nearly a year and a half later, Mr. Carney was taking that easy money back.\u201cIt\u2019s signaling that the bank has a degree of confidence that that immediate post-referendum worry has been put to bed,\u201d said Lucy O\u2019Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, an asset management firm in London. \u201cBut there\u2019s a long game to be played, and Mr. Carney is not convinced that Brexit is going to be anything other than harmful for the U.K. economy.\u201dLifting interest rates tends to increase the value of a nation\u2019s money, as investors arrive seeking higher returns. But markets pushed down the value of the British pound against both the dollar and the euro following the central bank\u2019s action, an apparent reflection of worry about Britain\u2019s economy and its trade with Europe.The clock is ticking toward a March 2019 deadline for negotiations between Britain and the European Union over their future dealings. So far, talks have produced a surplus of bitter recrimination and meager sign of an agreement.Uncertainty is already exacting a price. Nearly half of Britain\u2019s exports are sold within the European Union, a stream of cars, liquor and pharmaceuticals that could confront tariffs absent a completed trade deal. As the markets factor in the prospect of diminished trade across the English Channel, they have pushed down the value of the pound by nearly 15 percent against the euro since last year\u2019s Brexit vote.As the possibility looms that Britain might crash out of the European Union absent an agreement with the bloc, multinational companies are reassessing the merits of centering operations here, imperiling investment.Global auto manufacturers have similarly concentrated factories in Britain while exporting their wares across Europe. But as the potential for an unruly Brexit increases, auto companies are also calculating the merits of shifting production to European locales.If December passes without sign of progress on a trade deal \u2014 an outcome that is more than thinkable \u2014 that will likely accelerate decisions by multinational companies to move pieces of their businesses to Europe.In that scenario, Britain risks a recession next year, said Peter Urwin, director of the Centre for Employment Research at Westminster Business School in London. \u201cAt the very least, the odds are 50-50,\u201d he said.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Central banks tend to lift rates when economies are strengthening. They make credit more expensive so as to guard against the side-effects of rapid expansion, such as rising prices and reckless investment. Yet the Bank of England, Mr. Urwin suggested, appears to be less concerned about inflation than positioning itself to step in with more help if the economy weakens.\u201cThey are trying to get a little ammunition back in the armory,\u201d Mr. Urwin said.Many analysts assumed the bank was essentially forced to deliver the rate hike. Had it held back, that would have surprised investors \u2014 a taboo in central banking \u2014 while resonating as evidence of deepening concern about the health of the British economy.Investors might well have intensified their unloading of the British pound, exacerbating inflation, and increasing the strains facing the economy.Skipping the rate hike also would have put Britain further out of step with policymakers in the rest of the global economy, and especially the United States. The Federal Reserve has been lifting rates to return credit to more normal levels, following years of injections of extraordinarily cheap money.Yet in lifting rates, the Bank of England has slightly added to the headwinds assailing Britain on its continued slog toward Brexit. Retail and auto sales have been weak, even with ultracheap finance. Now, credit terms are likely to tighten along with variable mortgage rates. The cost of capital will climb slightly for companies already reluctant to invest in uncertain times.Given the backdrop, investors concluded that another rate hike is unlikely anytime soon.\u201cToday\u2019s excitement is likely to prove only a short hiatus before the economy returns to another extended period of monetary policy inaction,\u201d declared Matthew Beck, lead U.K. economist with Oxford Economics in London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Commercial Real Estate, Which Fueled Trump\u2019s Fortune, Fares Well in Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 An industry familiar to President Trump appears to have emerged from the Republican tax rewrite relatively unscathed: commercial real estate.For months, commercial real estate developers had been concerned that the tax plan in the works would make it more difficult or expensive for them to take out huge bank loans or would damage demand in the property market.\u201cThe industry was left whole,\u201d said Thomas J. Bisacquino, president of NAIOP, a commercial real estate development trade group. \u201cThe provisions we feel are working will still work.\u201dBut the bill included no such changes to the industry, and developers are thankful.\u201cI think Trump, having lived through a couple of real estate cycles, probably is in tune with this more than the average policy maker,\u201d said Martin Schuh, the head of government relations at the CRE Finance Council, a commercial real estate advocacy group. \u201cHim being an active industry participant gives him an insight that most folks don\u2019t have.\u201dMr. Trump is no stranger to how taxes can affect his industry. In 1991, he appeared before the House Budget Committee and laced into the tax overhaul ushered in by President Ronald Reagan five years earlier. Mr. Trump, a property developer at the time, said the legislation, which Republicans and the president himself now herald, was responsible for sinking commercial real estate prices and ushering in an economic downturn.This time Mr. Trump, who has the final signoff on any legislation, and his business empire have little to fear.Companies can now deduct their interest expenses on commercial loans, but under the House bill, certain industries would face a cap on the amount of interest that could be deducted each year.But that cap would not apply to commercial real estate.So-called like-kind transactions allow businesses to defer taxes on deal making if they do not pocket the cash. For instance, if a developer decides to sell a midsize office building to reinvest in a larger one, the proceeds would not be taxed immediately.While the plan does end the tax deferral for personal property exchanges, commercial real estate developers would keep the benefit.Carried interest is another big item that property developers were watching closely. Mr. Trump said many times on the campaign trail that he would close the \u201cloophole\u201d that allows hedge fund and private equity managers to have their compensation treated as capital gains and taxed at a rate of 23.8 percent, rather than as income, which is taxed as high as 39.6 percent. Partners at real estate firms receive similar treatment for returns on some of their investments.Surprisingly, the House plan does not address carried interest and the issue is largely moot because the new tax rate for pass-through businesses \u2014 which account for most real estate investment partnerships \u2014 would fall to 25 percent.Commercial real estate lobbyists remain cautious, since the bill could change as it moves through the House and Senate.The sector\u2019s residential real estate brethren are already feeling the pain of a tax plan that they say could rock the housing market by curbing the appeal of and limiting the mortgage interest deduction.Like the housing industry, commercial property was also hit hard during the financial crisis as companies laid off workers and needed less office space. While the market has largely rebounded, the Federal Reserve warned this year that property valuations were of \u201cgrowing concern\u201d and that appetites for commercial real estate lending could start to tighten.That Mr. Trump\u2019s industry has not been targeted with new taxes could provide fodder for critics of the Republican tax plan who have argued that the president is promoting policies that will enrich him and his family. Democrats have said that Mr. Trump must release his tax returns to provide transparency over potential conflicts of interest that he might have.\u201cAt the very same time that Trump\u2019s plan undercuts the home mortgage tax credit \u2014 and a host of others that middle-class Americans rely on \u2014 in order to finance a new giveaway to the wealthy and large corporations, he\u2019s including provisions that benefit his very own industry,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for American Bridge, a Democratic political action committee. \u201cThis entire administration is set up to help Trump profit.\u201dAfter the Reagan tax act, property prices declined because of a higher capital-gains tax rate and limits on deductions for some business losses.Those in the industry now hope that the president has not forgotten.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Tax Bill Takes a Big Step Forward With Committee Vote", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 The Senate took a big step forward when the Budget Committee voted to pass the Republicans\u2019 $1.5 trillion tax package, clearing the way for the full Senate to vote on the bill later this week.\u2022 After a day of deal making, several senators who were on the fence now seem more receptive to voting for the bill.\u2022 Some hurdles still exist, including aligning the Senate version with the House bill and ensuring that the changes some senators want don\u2019t rankle other lawmakers.\u2022 On Wednesday, the full Senate will vote on whether to proceed with consideration of the bill.\u2022 The advancement of the bill came after a day of partisan sparring in which Congress\u2019s two top Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, pulled out of a White House meeting after President Trump attacked them in a tweet.A flurry of last-minute deal making helped garner the support of a few Republican lawmakers who had expressed concerns about the $1.5 trillion package, including its treatment of small businesses and its effect on the deficit.The rapid turnaround underlines the pressure Republicans face to pass a tax cut and notch a significant legislative victory in their first year controlling both Congress and the White House. To help push the effort forward, President Trump visited Capitol Hill for a lunch meeting with Republican senators, where he made promises to some and admonished others.\u201cI think we\u2019re going to get it passed,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House later in the day. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have lots of adjustments before it ends, but the end result will be a very, very massive \u2014 the largest in the history of our country \u2014 tax cut.\u201dRepublicans emerged from the lunch increasingly optimistic about the bill\u2019s fate and played down the concerns that had threatened to bedevil its passage.Three key Republican holdouts, Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, sounded positive about the bill on Tuesday after gaining assurances from Mr. Trump and Republican leadership that those worries would be addressed.Among those who voted the bill out of committee were Mr. Johnson and Mr. Corker, both of whom had said on Monday they would oppose the legislation without changes to address their individual concerns. Mr. Johnson wants more favorable treatment for pass-through businesses and Mr. Corker wants assurances the $1.5 trillion tax bill won\u2019t add to the deficit.We modeled taxes for 25,000 middle-class families. Here\u2019s how the Senate bill would affect each of them.But the meeting with Mr. Trump and discussions with Republican leaders seemed to have swayed them enough to vote to advance the plan.On Wednesday, the Senate will vote on a procedural motion to begin consideration of the bill on the Senate floor. If that passes, the Senate can begin offering and debating amendments to the bill, which is a precursor to a floor vote that could happen on Friday.But there are still hurdles ahead, including the need to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the legislation. And there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of receptivity to the change that Mr. Corker wants made, which would require some taxes to increase if the overall package adds to the deficit.So while the Senate took a big step forward, it still has several more paces to go before declaring victory.\u201cRather than going to the White House for a show meeting that won\u2019t result in an agreement, we\u2019ve asked Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan to meet this afternoon. We don\u2019t have any time to waste in addressing the issues that confront us, so we\u2019re going to continue to negotiate with Republican leaders who may be interested in reaching a bipartisan agreement.\u201dSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, accused Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer of \u201cpettiness\u201d in declining to attend Tuesday afternoon\u2019s meeting.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that Senator Schumer and Leader Pelosi are refusing to come to the table and discuss urgent issues,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe president\u2019s invitation to the Democrat leaders still stands and he encourages them to put aside their pettiness, stop the political grandstanding, show up and get to work. These issues are too important.\u201dThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said in a statement that Democrats need to show up at the meeting if they care about preventing a government shutdown.Senate Republicans\u2019 tax cut would not pay for itself, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.\u201cWe have important work to do, and Democratic leaders have continually found new excuses not to meet with the administration to discuss these issues,\u201d they said. \u201cDemocrats are putting government operations, particularly resources for our men and women on the battlefield, at great risk by pulling these antics. There is a meeting at the White House this afternoon, and if Democrats want to reach an agreement, they will be there.\u201dMr. Schumer, speaking on the Senate floor, pounded on Republicans and Mr. Trump for blocking Democrats from participating in the tax overhaul, saying it would help the rich and corporations instead of the middle class.\u201cIt\u2019s an issue crying out for a bipartisan solution,\u201d he said of the tax rewrite. \u201cThere are a lot of areas we agree. We have to work to find a middle ground that\u2019s acceptable to both parties.\u201d The bill as it stands, he said, would balloon the debt and help hedge funds and lobbyists but not average Americans.Democrats are also worried about a provision in the Senate bill that repeals the requirement that most Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. Dropping the so-called individual mandate would produce savings that would help pay for the tax cuts, since people would forgo health insurance and therefore the government would spend less on subsidized health coverage.Right now, about 4.5 percent of tax filers pay a penalty rather than get health insurance. Here\u2019s a look at who they are and where they live:The Senate Republican tax bill includes the repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, the requirement that all Americans purchase qualifying health insurance or pay a penalty.Senate Republicans have been speeding ahead toward a vote on their tax bill even without a \u201cdynamic\u201d score from the Joint Committee on Taxation that would show the effects of the proposed tax cuts on the economy. That score is important, since it will show the extent to which the tax cuts will boost growth and avoid adding to the deficit.The analysis could roil the tax debate at the 11th hour by giving pause to deficit hawks in the Senate. It would be the first attempt by the committee to project the economic effects of the Republican tax plans. The House passed its bill this month before the committee could complete a so-called dynamic score of the bill.Outside analysts expect the score will show that the Senate bill does not create nearly enough economic growth to generate revenues to offset those lost via tax cuts. Such a showing would undermine Republicans\u2019 claims that the bill would pay for itself.In a letter that was sent on Monday to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the J.C.T. said there is still a chance that such an analysis could be ready this week, perhaps as soon as late Wednesday.\u201cThe Joint Committee staff is currently involved in analyzing the macroeconomic effects of the bill, and is trying to complete the analysis for purposes of producing the estimate of the budget effects\u201d in time to inform debate on the Senate floor, Thomas Barthold, chief of staff of the J.C.T. wrote in a letter to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the finance committee.Thus far, dynamic analyses of the Republican tax bills have failed to match the promises of the party\u2019s lawmakers that the tax cuts would pay for themselves by creating a surge of economic growth and new revenues.Mr. Barthold could make no guarantees that the analysis would be ready in time and he warned that it would not account for any last minute changes that are made to the bill.\u201cWhen we produce these estimates, we subject them to a number of quality checks before releasing them, and cannot guarantee a specific release time until we have completed that process,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toronto Transit Chief Is Tapped to Run New York\u2019s Ailing Subways", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision to name Andrew Byford, the chief executive of the Toronto Transit Commission, the president of New York City Transit followed a series of recent changes in leadership at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the subway. The aim has been to restore accountability and change a culture that for years has left the system lacking adequate funding or support.The subway has also been hampered by a high turnover rate \u2014 Mr. Byford will become the agency\u2019s fifth full-time leader in the last 10 years.While he earned wide praise for restoring Toronto\u2019s once-troubled transit system, Mr. Byford may find himself hostage to forces that have in recent years proven beyond the control of any one official, with the political whims and calculations of elected officials, including governors and mayors, driving critical financial decisions that have resulted in today\u2019s woeful state of affairs.Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the authority, said Mr. Byford had been on the radar of transit officials for years \u2014 dating back to his participation in a 2014 commission appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to examine how the authority could be improved. But despite producing recommendations that are now considered essential, like investing in basic infrastructure, the commission\u2019s findings were largely ignored. Still, when Mr. Cuomo put together a similar panel this summer, Mr. Byford was once again included.From the outset of the search for a new leader three months ago, Mr. Byford was a top contender. He has been considered a rising star in the transportation world with a deep resume that includes stops in Sydney and London before he went to Toronto, where, Mr. Lhota said, his record of achievement convinced officials that he was up to the task.\u201cHe knows how to change the culture of an organization,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were looking for a certain level of transit expertise combined with the political skill and moxie.\u201dMr. Cuomo met with Mr. Byford after he had received the backing of the Transportation Authority and was blunt about the challenges he would face, a conversation that Mr. Lhota said reinforced what Mr. Byford already knew.\u201cHe is an astute student of what New York City has done and not done,\u201d Mr. Lhota said.Mr. Byford, in a brief telephone interview, said he was impressed by the passion both Mr. Lhota and the governor brought to the subway\u2019s plight, but was under no illusions about the situation he is inheriting.He was circumspect when asked about controversial topics, like congestion pricing \u2014 a plan to charge drivers in the most crowded parts of Manhattan as a way to increase subway financing \u2014 and said he wanted to avoid getting enmeshed in political feuds.\u201cI leave the politics to the politicians,\u201d he said. He viewed his job as being an advocate for \u201csustained and sustainable\u201d funding, but was \u201cagnostic\u201d about how that should be achieved.Mr. Byford will take over an agency with a reputation for being intransigent and opaque and dominated by a political dynamic in which elected officials have used the Transportation Authority to serve their political priorities at the expense of focusing on the far less glamorous nuts and bolts needed to reliably operate an antiquated subway.Those decisions have helped create a situation in which just 65 percent of weekday trains reach their final destination on time, the lowest rate since the transit crisis of the 1970s. Unlike the 1970s, when subways covered in graffiti became emblems of urban decay and the city faced a financial meltdown, the current problems are all the more galling to riders and advocates because they come at a time when the city is booming and flush with tax revenues.Making solutions harder to reach is the sharp divide between Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio over how to address both the short- and long-term financial needs of the subways \u2014 a conflict that Mr. Byford will likely have to learn to navigate quickly if he is to start making tangible progress.He declined to weigh in on the matter on Tuesday, and Mr. Lhota said he viewed it as his role to \u201cinsulate\u201d Mr. Byford from such fights.But during a news conference in Toronto, Mr. Byford acknowledged the challenges ahead, calling his new posting \u201carguably the toughest job in transit right now.\u201dMr. Byford also acknowledged the subway\u2019s role in the life of the city, saying that it \u201chas driven New York City to become the bustling, successful metropolis that it is,\u2019\u2019 and added that it was his \u201cresponsibility to modernize the system and bring it to the high levels of performance and customer service that New Yorkers truly deserve.\u201dHe said he first rode the New York City subway in 1994 when he was on his honeymoon and \u201cmarveled at its complexity.\u201dIt dwarfs the system he currently oversees.While Toronto\u2019s transit system \u2014 the third largest in North America \u2014 carries about 1.7 million riders every weekday on its network of subways, streetcars and buses, New York City\u2019s system serves nearly six million daily riders just on the subway.In Canada, he oversaw 14,000 employees, while in New York he will manage about 47,000 workers.\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that the TTC, which was once an absolute jewel in the province\u2019s crown, has lost its way through lack of investment and, I\u2019d say, political influence over the last 30 years,\u201d he said in an interview with Toronto Life in 2015.Over the last several years, he has been credited with updating the system and paying more attention to addressing the needs of riders and being a transparent communicator, something Mr. Lhota has stressed is important to restoring the subway\u2019s credibility.One of the key innovations Mr. Byford oversaw in Toronto was the rollout of open \u201cgangway\u201d cars, which are separated by open, accordionlike passageways rather than doors. New York City is embracing the car design as way to create more room for subway riders and alleviate packed trains.Mr. Byford\u2019s plans for enhancing Toronto\u2019s service culminated in an award this year from the American Public Transportation Association for Outstanding Transit System of the Year.\u201cGenerally I have enjoyed Byford\u2019s era at the TTC for bringing a view that was not part of \u2018that\u2019s how we do things here,\u2019\u201d said Steve Munro, a longtime transit advocate in Toronto. \u201cHe will definitely be missed as an articulate, trusted face of the TTC, especially as we are about to go through both municipal and provincial elections with the latter likely to bring in a less transit-friendly government.\u201dNevertheless, Mr. Munro said that over the years, Mr. Byford had become somewhat less receptive to criticism, perhaps as a result of becoming entrenched in the bureaucracy he was brought in to change \u2014 a danger that could prove even harder to avoid in New York\u2019s sprawling transit agency.While giving him overall good marks, Mr. Munro said that the TTC has been working on a \u201cridership growth strategy\u201d for about two years without producing anything concrete. Officials have explained the delay by saying they want to \u201cget it right,\u201d he said. But he suspected that \u201cpolitical considerations\u201d might also be at work.\u201cOn the political front, the CEO\u2019s position has not been easy, but Byford has managed to hold his own against a critical audience,\u201d he said. \u201cMind you, I think the Toronto media, pols and public activists are pussycats by comparison, and he may be in for a surprise.\u201dIan Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa, and Emma G.

Mrs. Clinton has frequently channeled their anger over the past 10 months, since Mr. Trump took office, and the awards ceremony was no different.\u201cI got more votes than anybody except Barack Obama in 2008,\u201d Mrs. Clinton reminded her rapt crowd.Over 55 minutes, Mrs. Clinton criticized the Trump administration\u2019s \u201ccavalier\u201d approach to its dealings with Iran, attacked the administration\u2019s apparent willingness to embrace Russia amid accusations of meddling in the election, discussed her approval ratings, promoted her election memoir and lamented a toxic environment for women across industries, especially in her own.\u201cThe double standard that applies to women in politics is alive and well,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in a so-called fireside chat with Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California. \u201c\u2018Ambitious\u2019 is a compliment for men and it\u2019s not for women.\u201dMs. Brazile also wrote that the Clinton campaign had used a joint fund-raising agreement that would grant it control over strategy in exchange for raising funds. Ms. Brazile characterized the agreement as a \u201ccancer\u201d for the Democratic Party.Through a spokeswoman, officials for the party disagreed.\u201cJoint fund-raising committees were created between the DNC and both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in attempt to raise the general election funds needed to win in 2016,\u201d Xochitl Hinojosa, the communications director for the committee, wrote in an email on Thursday. \u201cClinton was the only candidate who raised money for the party through her joint fund-raising committee with the DNC, which would benefit any candidate coming out of the presidential primary process.\u201d\u201cIn terms of affecting the momentum of the race,\u201d she said, a letter sent by James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I. in 2016, \u201cwas the proximate cause.\u201d The letter reopened an investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails days before the election.Still, Mrs. Clinton also displays an edgy sense of humor.

{"Headline": "Russia Scandal Befalls Two Brothers: John and Tony Podesta", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 One is a rail-thin liberal idealist who spent his career in government, on campaigns and at think tanks. The other is an overweight pragmatist who made a fortune lobbying for all manner of liberal boogeymen.And now, in a twist with Shakespearean undertones, the two influential Washington brothers have found themselves on opposite sides of the scandals over Russian interference in the 2016 election.Mr. Podesta\u2019s older brother, Tony Podesta, has been ensnared in the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russia\u2019s meddling in the race and whether it involved any associates of President Trump. The efforts by his firm, the Podesta Group, to win support for the agenda of Viktor F. Yanukovych, the Russia-aligned former president of Ukraine, were cited in an indictment handed down last month against two former campaign aides to Mr. Trump, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, who arranged the Ukrainian lobbying work.For some Democrats, there is little question over who deserves the most sympathy.\u201cSure, the Clinton campaign made some mistakes, but that\u2019s not like representing a dictatorship,\u201d said James Carville, who has known John Podesta for years through Democratic political circles. Mr. Carville said he was less acquainted with Tony Podesta, but added that \u201cby reputation, you can\u2019t put them in the same book. John is one of the straightest guys I know. Everybody says, \u2018Can you believe that those guys are brothers?\u2019\u201dTony Podesta, 74, built one of the highest-grossing lobbying firms in Washington, signing clients across industries and ideologies \u2014 including defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, banks like Wells Fargo, drug makers like Mylan and foreign regimes like the government of the former Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak. Tony Podesta is known for his fund-raising \u2014 in 2016, he donated or raised nearly $900,000 for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic Party \u2014 as well as for a lavish lifestyle.Had Mrs. Clinton prevailed, as official Washington expected, it most likely would have cemented the legacies of both brothers \u2014 John Podesta as a key confidant to presidents and one of the most important Democratic strategists of the past century, and Tony Podesta as the go-to lobbyist for Democratic administrations. Instead, the Podestas have been drawn into the vortex of investigations and conspiracy theories that have enveloped Washington in the Trump era.Last week\u2019s indictment did not name the Podesta Group or another firm with which it worked on the Ukraine account, Mercury Public Affairs. Instead, the indictment referred to them as \u201ctwo Washington, D.C., firms\u201d that were recruited by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates.While both firms disclosed the work to Congress under less-rigorous domestic lobbying rules, they did not initially register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The indictment alleges that was done intentionally \u2014 by routing the money through a Brussels-based nonprofit \u2014 \u201cto minimize public disclosure of their lobbying campaign\u201d that \u201cwas under the ultimate direction\u201d of Mr. Yanukovych, his party and his government.John Podesta, for his part, has dedicated his time since the election to trying to expose the connections between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia.John Podesta \u201ccould have gone into a bunker and vanished, but instead he dedicated himself to fighting this,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, who worked for him at the Center for American Progress and serves with him on the board of Democracy Forward. \u201cHe is very driven by exacting some measure of justice for the unscrupulous form of politics that was utilized against him and his side,\u201d said Mr. Shakir, who considers Mr. Podesta a mentor.Both brothers declined interview requests through their representatives. But John Podesta provided a written response to a question about whether he saw it as tragic \u2014 or at least ironic \u2014 that the Russia investigation for which he has been advocating has ensnared his brother.\u201cThe only tragedy is that Donald Trump is president and got there with the Russians\u2019 help,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a tragedy for the American people.\u201dFor both John and Tony Podesta, the connections with Democratic politics began at an early age. In 1970, they worked together on the Rev. Joseph D. Duffey\u2019s antiwar Senate campaign in Connecticut, for which Tony Podesta served as a top official, and his younger brother \u2014 as well as Bill and Hillary Clinton \u2014 were volunteers.Over the next 23 years, the brothers\u2019 paths intertwined. They wove in and out of campaigns and car-pooled together to Georgetown University\u2019s law school, from which they both earned degrees in 1976. Tony Podesta joined the United States attorney\u2019s office in Washington, while John Podesta went to work at the Justice Department.After a few years, the brothers left those jobs \u2014 John Podesta joining the Democratic staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Tony Podesta becoming the founding president of the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way.In 1987, the brothers teamed up to create a lobbying and public relations firm called Podesta Associates, which was seen as having a liberal bearing, representing a mix of public interest groups and media companies and associations. But after Mr. Clinton won the presidency in 1992 \u2014 a campaign for which both Podestas worked \u2014 the brothers\u2019 paths diverged once and for all. John Podesta took a job in the White House and divested his stake in the firm, which Tony Podesta pointed in a less ideological direction.By President Obama\u2019s second year in office, domestic lobbying revenues for the Podesta Group had risen to more than $29 million, buoyed in part by the perception of access to the new administration.The brothers remained close, even as their lifestyles took different paths.John Podesta, who remains married to the mother of his three children, lives in a relatively modest house near American University in Northwest Washington, where his clan makes a habit of getting together for home cooked pasta.In the end, said Lanny Davis, who has known both Podestas since the Duffey campaign, the brothers have much in common.\u201cTony Podesta may have clients that are way to the right of him in politics,\u201d he said, \u201cbut neither John nor Tony Podesta, no matter who their clients are, have withdrawn one inch from being liberal Democrats with progressive values.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India\u2019s Top Payments App Adds Chatting, Challenging WhatsApp", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 India\u2019s smartphone users love Paytm for sending money and WhatsApp for sending messages. Now each company is getting into the other\u2019s business.Paytm unveiled an updated version of its service on Friday that integrates chat features, including photo and video sharing, into its market-leading digital wallet.The move is a pre-emptive strike against WhatsApp, the global messaging app used by about two-thirds of India\u2019s 300 million smartphone users. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, has been developing a person-to-person payment service for India that it plans to introduce in the next few months.Deepak Abbot, Paytm\u2019s senior vice president of product, said his company had decided to add the communications feature, called Inbox, because its executives saw millions of people using its service to send money to other individuals without any way of discussing those payments inside the app.\u201cIf I sent money to you, I\u2019d wonder, \u2018Hey, have you received the money?\u2019\u201d Mr. Abbot said in an interview. \u201cEither I\u2019d call you, or find another messaging app.\u201d From that simple problem, a full-fledged chat service was born.With nearly $2 billion in financing from Alibaba, China\u2019s leading e-commerce company, and SoftBank, the Japanese investment giant, Paytm jumped in. It marketed itself to small merchants and consumers as an easy way to make all sorts of payments with a few taps on a smartphone. The company now offers a wide range of products, from gold by the gram to airline and movie tickets, and it said 100 million Indians visited its service at least once a month.WhatsApp, which claims more than 200 million monthly active users in India and 1.3 billion worldwide, has eyed business services and person-to-person payments as a potential way to generate revenue from what has been a free service. Facebook paid $22 billion in cash and stock for WhatsApp in 2014.The messaging service has already begun experimenting with verified business accounts in India, which companies use to communicate with customers. The payments feature will let Indian users send immediate payments to one another via a chat message.Neeraj Arora, head of business at WhatsApp, said in an October interview that his team was studying opportunities created by India\u2019s demonetization and the government\u2019s broader campaign to push more business and services online.\u201cThey are trying to digitize every part of society,\u201d said Mr. Arora, who also sits on the board of Paytm. \u201cWe play right in the middle of it. It\u2019s natural for us to think about improving the experience.\u201dWhatsApp\u2019s overall popularity could give its new payments service a leg up, but Mr. Abbot said it would also raise awareness for all digital payment services, including Paytm.WhatsApp, like another new service from Google, Tez, will probably be limited to transferring funds from one person\u2019s bank account to another\u2019s because of complex Indian banking regulations. Paytm has cast itself as a broader financial player, handling payments made by credit and debit cards, the government\u2019s electronic transfer system, and digital wallets.A Paytm banking affiliate is exploring how to offer loans too small to interest a normal bank, with creditworthiness assessed by examining a borrower\u2019s transactions on the service. And a Paytm digital mall is selling physical products.Messaging is just Paytm\u2019s latest brand extension. Mr. Abbot said other plans for the chat service included a personalized news feed of special offers based on each user\u2019s history in the app.\u201cEventually it might become the main screen for Paytm,\u201d he said. \u201cPaytm is at heart a payments company.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At the graduate level, the number is reversed: About 80 percent hail from India, China, Korea, Turkey and other foreign countries.For graduate students far from home, the swirl of cultures is both reassuring and invigorating. \u201cYou\u2019re comfortable everyone is going through the same struggles and journeys as you are,\u201d said Vibhati Joshi of Mumbai, India, who\u2019s in her final semester for a master\u2019s degree in financial engineering. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201dIn arts and humanities, the figure was about 16 percent; in business, a little more than 18 percent.Many factors contribute to the gap, but a major one is the booming job market in technology. For the most part, Americans don\u2019t see the need for an advanced degree when there are so many professional opportunities waiting for them. For some, the price is just too high when they have so much student debt already.\u201cYou can believe that U.S. bachelor\u2019s students, if they\u2019re good, can go get a job at Microsoft or Google with a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d said Edward D. Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington.Universities and employers are eager to tap the pool of international talent that helps them stay competitive globally, and graduate programs have a financial incentive in attracting them: Demand from abroad is so high, administrators don\u2019t see a need to offer as much tuition assistance.The Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, for example, saw a 30 percent decrease in international applications to its professional master\u2019s program for this semester, according to the dean, Joseph J. Helble. Dr. Helble surveyed more than two dozen engineering deans earlier this year, and three quarters of them said they, too, had seen significant drops in international graduate applications. But enrollment, he said, was not off.Still, trends are not clear.\u201cIf there are one or two more years of comparable 20 to 30 percent decreases in international applications, we\u2019re very concerned about our ability to conduct research and spin off and start companies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned from a competitive perspective.\u201dDan Spaulding, who oversees human resources at Zillow Group, the online real estate company, said that in specialized areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence, his company favors graduate degrees, but for the vast majority of its technical jobs, a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science is adequate. He said he has heard concerns from students and managers about an international chill, but for now the supply of students with computer science skills hasn\u2019t been affected.\u201cA great many of them are coming in with programming skills first and looking to radiate out into other business disciplines, product management, product design,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think going deep academically is not a priority for as many computer science students today.\u201dIn 1994, only about 40 percent of students who were enrolled in computer science Ph.D. programs were from outside the country, according to the Computing Research Association survey.As the economy improved, the percentage of Americans in graduate programs dropped. \u201cGoing to grad school became less of a priority for so many students,\u201d said Stuart Zweben, co-author of the survey and professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University. \u201cYou had to really be interested in research or something special.\u201dThe balance of computer science graduate programs began to tilt toward so-called nonresident aliens in the late 1990s, when well-capitalized dot-coms began scouring for programmers, sometimes encouraging summer interns to drop out of school, Dr. Zweben said.Students from other countries have long seen graduate school as their best path to employment and residency in the United States, and for the industry connections they are not likely to find in their home countries.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to get access from here,\u201d said Ms. Joshi, who is president of the N.Y.U. finance club. She wanted to attend N.Y.U. so she could merge her background in information technology with her interest in the financial industry. She has regular exposure to industry speakers and recruiters.And he would like to see more of them enrolled in the graduate programs. \u201cI feel that\u2019s an imbalance,\u201d he said, \u201cthat absolutely needs to be corrected.\u201dNick Wingfield is a technology correspondent at The Times based in Seattle.Advertisement"}

All the same, three of four registered New York voters stayed home. Their silence, of itself, was an important statement. What many of them may have been saying is that they were displeased with this mayor, but also found the competition unpalatable.Mr. de Blasio might want to bear in mind that, give or take a percentage point, he won a mere 16 percent of the eligible electorate. That\u2019s miles from brilliant.He was in a similar situation when he was first elected in 2013. Yet he acted then as if he had been crowned with a laurel wreath. Cockiness caused him to stumble more than necessary \u2014 among other things, by being foolishly late to appointments, excessively protective of dubious supporters and overly confident that he had national status. Maybe he has learned from those unforced errors and will enter his second term with confidence but also essential humility.Voters did not give Cyrus Vance Jr. a mandate, either. That may seem odd to say, given that Mr. Vance won a third term as Manhattan district attorney with more than 90 percent of ballots cast. But his was the only name on the ballot. Even so, 9.4 percent of the voters took the trouble to write in the names of others they preferred. (Their identities are not yet known, but we bet Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan who was ousted by President Trump, got some support.)Finally, voters did not do well by women in New York politics. It wasn\u2019t entirely their fault. In a city that\u2019s overwhelmingly blue, relatively few female Democrats were on the ballot for City Council. Unless a further count changes the result in a Queens district, the new Council will have only 11 women among its 51 members \u2014 not quite 22 percent. That\u2019s down from 18 women in 2009, and it reinforces a warning from the Council\u2019s women\u2019s caucus in August that \u201cwe face a systemic crisis of representation.\u201dPerhaps equally important, after 12 years of that body\u2019s speakership being held by women, the position seems destined to go to a man.

{"Headline": "Time Inc. Sells Itself to Meredith Corp., Backed by Koch Brothers", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA long chapter in media history came to an unlikely close on Sunday night with a sale agreement for Time Inc., the publisher of once-prestigious magazine titles including Time, Sports Illustrated and People.The Meredith Corporation \u2014 the owner of Family Circle, Better Homes and Gardens and AllRecipes \u2014 agreed to purchase Time Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at nearly $3 billion. The deal was made possible, in part, by an infusion of $650 million from the private equity arm of Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire brothers known for using their wealth and political connections to advance conservative causes.The deal could represent the beginning of the end for one of the country\u2019s most celebrated magazine publishers, whose titles commanded the attention of global leaders and chronicled world events, sometimes with striking photography. It also brings together two companies that have long courted different audiences, seeking readerships that echoed the places they called home.Time Inc. is New York to its core. The company was founded by Henry R. Luce and Briton Hadden, who had worked together in their college days at the Yale Daily News. Together they hatched the idea of a fast-paced weekly that would capture an increasingly hectic and urbanized world.After the successful start of the business magazine Fortune in 1930, Luce added Life magazine to Time Inc.\u2019s growing stable and transformed it into a wide-ranging general interest magazine that made use of glorious photography to capture movie stars, world leaders and exotic, far-flung places. In the middle of the 20th century, Time Inc. even had its own film arm, with \u201cThe March of Time\u201d series of news shorts that played in movie theaters before the main feature.Meredith, based in Des Moines, is a Midwestern publisher through and through. Its founder, Edwin Thomas Meredith, entered the media business in 1902 with a magazine called Successful Farming. He soon began the still-thriving Better Homes and Gardens, which has a circulation of more than 7 million.Its popular magazines have long focused on families and women, taking aim more at Middle America. It has eschewed an expensive headquarters in Manhattan and maintained a diversified portfolio \u2014 the company also owns local television stations \u2014 that has allowed Meredith to better weather the economic storm that has faced print publishers.But as Meredith has stood relatively strong, Time Inc. has stumbled. The company failed to keep pace as the industrywide transformation from print to digital rendered old methods of magazine-making obsolete and publishing companies crumbled under the pressure of declines in print advertising and circulation.For Meredith, a hardy company with a loyal print readership, the acquisition of Time Inc. represents a long-elusive victory.\u201cThis is a transformative transaction for Meredith Corporation,\u201d Tom Harty, Meredith\u2019s president and chief operating officer, said in the company\u2019s statement announcing the agreement.Charles Koch, the chief executive of Koch Industries, and David Koch have long sought to shape political discourse through their support of nonprofit organizations, universities and think tanks. But in its announcement of the deal, Meredith said that the private equity fund, Koch Equity Development, would not have a seat on Meredith\u2019s board of directors and would \u201chave no influence on Meredith\u2019s editorial or managerial operations.\u201dSteve Lombardo, a spokesman for Koch Industries, also said that the Kochs had no plans to take an active role in the expanded company. \u201cThis is a passive financial investment made through our equity development arm,\u201d Mr. Lombardo said. The company\u2019s role in the transaction, he said, was similar to that of a bank.Mr. Lombardo said the company is constantly evaluating investment opportunities.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at deals across all sectors, all industries,\u201d he said. \u201cThis just happened to be one that made sense.\u201dA deal between Meredith and Time Inc. fell apart in 2013 after Meredith reportedly said that it did not want to acquire some of Time Inc.\u2019s best-known titles, including Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated. Meredith also expressed interest in buying Time Inc. earlier this year before it walked away \u2014 in part because it could not secure sufficient financing. The Kochs helped the company overcome that problem.In a note to its staff members on Sunday night, Rich Battista, the chief executive of Time Inc., said he believed in \u201cour strategic transformation plan and in our ability to write the next great chapter of this storied company.\u201d\u201cThat said, as a publicly traded company, and one operating in such a dynamic industry as media, we know circumstances can change quickly,\u201d he said. Meredith, Mr. Battista added, \u201cpresented us with an opportunity to combine companies to create even greater scale and financial flexibility.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, Meredith will pay $18.50 a share for Time Inc. The boards of both companies finalized the deal on Sunday evening. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.The investment from the Kochs, Meredith said, \u201cunderscores a strong belief in Meredith\u2019s strength as a business operator, its strategies and its ability to unlock significant value from the Time Inc. acquisition.\u201dSome Koch allies have suggested that the brothers would view their investment purely as a moneymaking opportunity. But others familiar with the Kochs\u2019 thinking speculated that they could nonetheless use the media properties \u2014 which reach millions of online and print readers \u2014 to promote their brand of conservatism. The investment would also give the Kochs a way to combine the arsenal of voter information held by a data analytics company controlled by their network, i360, with the publishers\u2019 consumer data.After Time Warner, the home of HBO and Warner Bros., spun off Time Inc. in 2014, the publisher was left to fend for itself in a world increasingly turning its back on print media. Bedeviled by relentless cost cuts and executive turnover, the company has struggled to articulate a business strategy less focused on the printed page.Time Inc. executives had been adamant that their stand-alone strategy could position the company for a successful future. But in an industry that increasingly values size and breadth, Time Inc. was staring into ongoing uncertainty. For its most recent quarter, it reported a 9 percent drop in total revenue compared with the same period last year, and a 12 percent decrease in advertising revenue.Mr. Battista is expected to stay on at Time Inc. through the close of the deal, after which he will leave the company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Organization Will Exit From Its Struggling SoHo Hotel in New York", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe announcement came on his television show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Donald J. Trump would open his second luxury hotel in New York, a \u201cwork of art\u201d in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan that would become \u201can awe-inspiring masterpiece.\u201dThat was 11 years ago. The 46-story skyscraper, it turned out, was actually an albatross for Mr. Trump \u2014 drawing local opposition soon after its unveiling, partisan protests when he became a candidate for president and political scrutiny because of its early ties to a dubious Russian deal maker.Now, in the latest sign of strain in the president\u2019s family business, the Trumps want no more.Under the exit deal, the Trump Organization will sever its contract with the building\u2019s owner, an investment firm in California that focuses primarily on real estate. As with many of their properties, the Trumps do not own the SoHo hotel, but instead manage the day-to-day operations. The Trump Organization is entitled to a cut of the hotel\u2019s revenue, although the contract also requires the Trumps to pay the owner, CIM Group, if the property fails to meet certain financial performance standards.With years remaining on the contract, CIM will pay the Trumps to end the arrangement early, according to people briefed on the matter, who described the negotiations as amicable. A buyout enables CIM to either rebrand the property, or to buy more condo units and expand the hotel before eventually selling it. The company did not disclose the proposed price of a buyout.Despite the challenges, the SoHo hotel is a signature property in the backyard of the Trump family empire, making the Trump Organization\u2019s cutting of ties unexpected. The property also carried emotional significance for the family: Not only did Mr. Trump announce the project on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d but his elder children \u2014 Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric \u2014 were on hand, in 2007, for a glittering launch party.More recently, the Trump Organization and CIM, which took over the property in 2014 after the Trumps\u2019 prior partners defaulted on a loan, discussed ways to upgrade the hotel and replace the closed restaurant. Along with an election-related slump, the general lack of investment may have partly contributed to the hotel\u2019s struggles.\u201cUnder the seasoned management of the Trump Organization, the hotel has been established as one of the finest in New York City with recognition among top critics, including CondeNast Traveler Magazine and Forbes Travel Guide,\u201d Bill Doak, a CIM executive, said in a statement. \u201cWe recognize and sincerely appreciate their contributions to this exceptional asset and the strong working relationship we have with the Trump Organization.\u201dOverall, the Trump Organization\u2019s portfolio of golf, hotel and commercial properties brought in at least $597 million in revenue during his 2016 campaign and the first few months of his presidency, down about 3 percent from the prior period, according to the president\u2019s most recent financial disclosure released in June. New ventures overseen by Eric and Donald Jr., including two chains of hotels, have also had slow starts as the Trumps must comply with a lengthy review process as part of their father\u2019s presidential ethics pledge.The Trump Organization still has plenty of bright spots, in both golf and hotels. The Trump International Hotel in Washington, a favorite meet-up spot for Republican officials and lobbyists, is raking in money, turning a nearly $2 million profit in the first quarter this year, records show. His other hotel in Manhattan has fared better than the SoHo.The decision about the SoHo property was made by Donald Jr. and Eric, who run the business, along with a small group of senior executives. President Trump still owns the company but is removed from day-to-day operations.The SoHo property ran into troubles from the get-go.The project went ahead and opened in 2010, but was continually troubled by litigation involving business partners, and even a criminal investigation.At the same time, a separate lawsuit alleged that the project was backed by felons and financing from Russia. Felix Sater, a Russian deal maker, felon and F.B.I. informant, had helped facilitate the deal, the lawsuit said.The more recent struggles at the SoHo tower partly reflect a broader red-blue political divide that is shaping the Trump Organization\u2019s bottom line: Most Trump golf clubs fared better in areas that supported President Trump in last year\u2019s election than in those that did not, according to the president\u2019s financial disclosure and other business records.More broadly, the Trump Organization is navigating the restrictions that come with the presidential era. As long as Mr. Trump is in office, the company has vowed not to pursue new deals in foreign countries, cutting off a central stream of business, and is subjecting all new domestic projects to vetting from an outside ethics adviser. Six of the company\u2019s 25 golf and hotel properties are overseas.The lack of new deals has the Trumps exploring other ways to pull in revenue. This month the Trumps opened an online store, TrumpStore.com, selling hats, polos and other golf gear bearing the Trump name.Advertisement"}

The authorities discovered 148 \u201cillegal and fraudulent accounts\u201d from the bank, involving more than 10,000 people, the Xinhua report said.Underground banks are illegal but common in China. According to China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security, underground banks handled more than $137 billion in transactions last year. There are also lawful ways of moving princely sums out of China without surpassing government limits: directing money to casinos in Macau \u2014 the only Chinese territory where casino gambling is legal \u2014 as well as using credit cards to buy luxury goods abroad and purchasing insurance policies that can be cashed out overseas.President Xi Jinping has made it a top priority to keep more money in China. His government has shut down platforms that trade cryptocurrencies; announced controls on outbound investment in property, entertainment and soccer; and imposed curbs on payments overseas.Much of China\u2019s underground banking activity is centered in cities that border Hong Kong and Macau, special administrative regions of China that are governed by their own laws.In Shaoguan, the police were alerted to a suspicious bank account that was opened in 2011 in the city by a Mr. Zhong, a resident from the southern city of Zhuhai that borders Macau, according to Guangzhou Daily, an official newspaper. It did not further identify Mr. Zhong. After almost no activity for years, there were 121 transactions involving $15 million in 2016, prompting the authorities to look more closely at who was involved.Ultimately, the Xinhua report said, the authorities discovered that the people running the underground bank had illegally bought and stole the identity documents of more than 200 people to open the fake accounts that underpinned the enterprise. News reports did not disclose detailed information about how the underground bank worked.The Shaoguan government and the police did not respond to requests for comment.The trail appeared to lead to Macau, according to the news reports. The suspicious bank account that prompted the investigation was opened specifically for a gambler in Macau called Mr. Peng to transfer money, Xinhua said. \u201cSeveral members of the criminal gang\u201d then converted the renminbi into Hong Kong dollars for Mr. Peng, according to the report. Hong Kong has its own currency, which tracks the value of the United States dollar.The Xinhua report did not offer details about Mr. Peng.Macau is under pressure to keep a tight rein on capital outflows. Most recently, it installed automated teller machines with facial recognition software to monitor transactions for people using Chinese bank cards, according to Macau Daily Times.The Xinhua report acknowledged that underground banks are \u201cseductive,\u201d especially for people who struggle to get financing, but warned that \u201cthe people will suffer tremendous loss\u201d if the banks abscond or cheat their clients.Zhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Distaste for Honduran Leaders Who Linger Fuels Distrust in Election", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEGUCIGALPA, Honduras \u2014 There are two versions of President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez of Honduras, who is seeking a second term in a country where the idea of re-election is so toxic that another president was ousted in a coup just for talking about it.That stark difference in perceptions has turned Sunday\u2019s election into a referendum on how much control over the country\u2019s fragile institutions Honduran voters are willing to cede to Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, a conservative.\u201cRe-election means the strengthening of presidential rule and an increase in the concentration of power,\u201d said Victor Meza, a security analyst and former interior minister. The result, he said, \u201ccould unleash an unchecked authoritarianism.\u201dAlthough many Latin American countries now allow re-election, a deep distrust of leaders who maneuver to stay in power persists, a legacy of the region\u2019s history of dictatorship. That suspicion is at the heart of this election campaign, in which the opposition argues that Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s place on the ballot is illegitimate.What put him there was a ruling by the Supreme Court, which lifted the Constitution\u2019s ironclad ban on presidential re-elections in a circuitous ruling two years ago. The five judges who made the decision all owed their positions to Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, and their predecessors had been hurriedly dismissed or moved.The ruling went unopposed by the country\u2019s political and business leaders \u2014 who had a very different attitude in 2009, when they removed the leftist President Manuel Zelaya on the grounds that he was maneuvering to find a way around the re-election ban.The coup, and the widely criticized ruling of the handpicked Supreme Court, were blows to democracy, said Fernando Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, a lawyer who served as a minister in two governments.\u201cThere is no more real dialogue,\u201d he said.Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez is favored to win a second four-year term because the opposition is split, and he just needs to win the plurality of votes, which his party\u2019s base could give him, not a majority.The Libre Party led by Mr. Zelaya, and a smaller party, have formed what they are calling the \u201copposition alliance against the dictatorship,\u201d or the Alianza, to compete in this election, and have put forth the former sportscaster and game-show host Salvador Nasralla as the coalition\u2019s presidential candidate.The third main candidate is Luis Zelaya (not related to the former president), an academic who won the Liberal Party nomination and has broken his party\u2019s loose alliance with the Hern\u00e1ndez presidency to mount a confrontational campaign.Under pressure, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, who has said he did not know about the illegal financing, agreed to allow the formation of a panel of foreign prosecutors to help their Honduran counterparts and to propose anticorruption laws.But efforts at reform have been hampered by Congress, where the National Party has a working majority. Legislators have yet to pass proposals that would encourage suspects in corruption and other criminal cases to cooperate with prosecutors, and they have not rewritten a broad secrecy law that allows the government to withhold documents of state agencies.Instead, Congress passed a penal code that slashes prison sentences for corruption by almost two-thirds in some cases.\u201cIn politics, there are no coincidences,\u201d Mr. Jim\u00e9nez said.Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, 49, has refused to debate any his opponents during the campaign, and his allies have helped squash any discussion of corruption.A new antiterrorism law makes it a crime to march in a protest and opens journalists to the charge of aiding terrorists if they report on a demonstration.\u201cHondurans aren\u2019t allowed to express themselves as they want, and they feel that their votes don\u2019t count,\u201d said Juliette Handal, a prominent business executive who ran for office as a Libre candidate in 2013 but is now an independent. The effect spills beyond politics, she warned.\u201cNo country can have a strong economy if it doesn\u2019t have strong institutions,\u201d Ms. Handal said.Under Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s predecessor, violence spiked so drastically that Honduras became one of the world\u2019s most dangerous countries. Tens of thousands of Hondurans, including many children traveling alone, fled, seeking asylum in the United States.\u201cHonduras is an unconditional and obliging ally of the United States in security,\u201d Mr. Meza, the security analyst, said. \u201cBut it turns out to be uncomfortable,\u201d he added, \u201con the issue of corruption.\u201dThe homicide rate fell 28 percent from its peak in 2012 through 2016 and has continued to drop this year, the result of a combination of actions, including new investigative units, the dismantling of some drug cartels and better policing in high-crime neighborhoods.But Honduras remains one of the most deadly countries in the world, and more than 90 percent of homicides go unpunished.With money from a special tax on financial transactions, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez has built maximum security prisons and set up a military police force. He has also extradited more than a dozen drug traffickers to the United States.A commission set up to purge corruption in the police has dismissed thousands of officers and is replacing the old force with newly trained young recruits.The effort has convinced Norma Ortiz, 52, who runs a stall selling children\u2019s clothes at an outdoor market in Tegucigalpa, the capital. \u201cWe\u2019re happy. He has sent a bunch of the big bosses to el Pozo,\u201d Ms. Ortiz said, referring to one of the new prisons known as \u201cthe Well.\u201dShe used to pay a little over $4 a week in extortion money, but the gangs stopped coming around after the police and soldiers began regular patrols in the market, she said.As part of his anti-crime push, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez has built parks guarded by the military police. It is one of the measures that persuaded Karen Mart\u00ednez, 34, to switch her vote from the Liberal Party and support Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez.\u201cHe has put a bit of an iron fist on the situation of the country,\u201d said Ms. Mart\u00ednez, a saleswoman in a bridal store who had brought her 3- and 6-year-old boys to play in the park at the edge of a rough neighborhood.Luis Cruz, 33, and Fernando Torres, 21, had come to play soccer at the park, but they had no love for Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez. The military police harassed them constantly, they said, taking their money, their cellphones, even their soccer balls.Critics argue that many of Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s social programs are designed simply to buy votes \u2014 with a deliberate blurring between his National Party and the government.In the town of Santa Luc\u00eda, a National Party stronghold outside Tegucigalpa, many voters at a recent rally had received handouts, including wood-fueled stoves for baking bread. A party worker had showed up that morning at the home of Juliana Mart\u00ednez Avila, 51, a widow with six children, with a bag of food staples.Voters waiting for an Alianza rally in Talanga, a farming town outside the capital, also expected help from politicians. Mayeli L\u00f3pez, 25, said that a promise by Mr. Nasralla to cancel highway tolls would help her husband\u2019s small trucking business.Flags were waving as Mr. Nasralla and Mr. Zelaya rolled into the town.\u201cWe hope they keep all their promises,\u201d said Jonathan Urbina, 20, who drives a three-wheeled motor taxi when he can get work. \u201cWith deeds, not just with words.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Says G.O.P. Tax Bill Wouldn\u2019t Benefit Him. That\u2019s Not True.", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SensePresident Trump likes to argue that the tax-reform legislation hurtling through Congress this week will protect low- and middle-income households, \u201cnot the wealthy and well connected.\u201d He puts himself forward as Exhibit A.So surely at least a few of the most egregious loopholes that benefit Mr. Trump and real estate developers like him will be closed.Not in the slightest.In fact, the proposals seem almost tailor-made to enrich the president and people like him.\u201cCommercial real estate came out essentially unscathed,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative advocacy group. Real estate developers \u201cdidn\u2019t lose anything they care about,\u201d and they got even more breaks, like a shorter depreciation schedule in the Senate tax bill, Mr. Holtz-Eakin pointed out.Mr. Trump still has not released his tax returns, so it\u2019s impossible to know to what extent he would personally benefit from the legislation. But there\u2019s little doubt that he would.\u201cLower pass-through rates and the repeal of the alternative minimum tax \u2014 those two alone are so hugely beneficial to Trump that I have trouble imagining any way that he wouldn\u2019t come out ahead,\u201d said Steve Wamhoff, senior fellow for federal tax policy at the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. (The pass-through reference involves income that typically comes from partnerships and limited liability companies.)Not only that, but rental income, royalty payments and licensing fees \u2014 some of the president\u2019s major sources of income \u2014 get especially favorable treatment under new rates for pass-through income. (Mr. Trump\u2019s assets include more than 500 pass-through partnerships and limited liability companies.)As many people have pointed out, the \u201cwealthy and well connected,\u201d as Mr. Trump described them, will benefit disproportionately from the proposed legislation. That\u2019s in large part because the big tax cuts for corporations heavily favor shareholders, and the wealthy own a disproportionate amount of stocks and other assets.Many wealthy taxpayers will also benefit from the lower rates on pass-through income, since such income accrues overwhelmingly to the wealthiest taxpayers.Even among that affluent population, the additional breaks that would benefit Mr. Trump and a small cadre of real estate developers like him stand out.Consider one of the most criticized loopholes in the current tax code: the exemption from taxation of so-called like-kind exchanges. That has enabled owners of property to sell at a large capital gain but defer any tax as long as they use the proceeds to buy some other property.The House and Senate bills eliminate the favored treatment of like-kind exchanges \u2014 except for \u201creal property.\u201d Owners of paintings, for example, would not be able to sell a Cezanne and buy a Van Gogh tax-free. But owners of commercial real estate could keep flipping the properties until they die without ever paying any capital gains tax. (And if the estate tax is abolished, the gains might go untaxed forever.)One of the biggest reforms in the tax legislation would limit the ability of businesses to deduct interest payments from their taxable income while giving them the ability to expense capital improvements (rather than depreciate them). Commercial real estate interests had howled over this provision, because they rely so heavily on debt to finance their operations.The list goes on. In both the House and Senate legislation, only certain kinds of income are eligible for the lower pass-through rates. Short-term capital gains, dividends, interest and annuity payments do not qualify.But rent, royalties and licensing fees \u2014 all similar in character to the disallowed income \u2014 weren\u2019t included in that list, Mr. Rosenthal pointed out. All remain eligible for the lower pass-through rate.\u201cI call them the Donald J. Trump exceptions,\u201d since the president receives so much income from those sources, Mr. Rosenthal said. \u201cTrump will get a huge windfall on his rental, license and royalty income,\u201d he predicted.A major way that losses are generated in real estate ventures is through depreciation, which is supposed to reflect the way that assets lose value over time. But a well-maintained building typically gains value (and maintenance costs are all deductible). So most depreciation charges lead to what the president might call \u201cfake\u201d losses, and they might never be recouped, because taxes on any sale can be deferred through like-kind exchanges.The House and Senate rejected proposals to curb the use of such noncash charges. Instead, the Senate, by shortening the depreciation schedule for commercial property to 25 from 39 years, would accelerate the rate at which real estate investors can take such deductions.From what little is known of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, he used losses to offset virtually all of his taxable income for years by generating something called net operating loss carry-overs. Under both the House and Senate versions, such carry-overs can be used to offset only 90 percent of a person\u2019s taxable income (and, in the Senate version, 80 percent after 2022, which reverts to 90 percent after 2025 if revenue targets are met) in a given year. That is a modest improvement over the existing code, but it still allows for the full offset over time.One of the biggest benefits for the president, and for other wealthy taxpayers with high deductions, is the proposed repeal of the alternative minimum tax. Thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s leaked 2005 tax return, we know that the only reason he paid federal tax of 24 percent of his taxable income that year was because of the alternative minimum tax. (Without it, he would have paid just 4 percent.)The rationale for eliminating the alternative minimum tax is that such a backup system should not be necessary if the tax code is fundamentally fair and eliminates all the loopholes that made it possible for high-income taxpayers to escape taxation in the first place. As should be obvious by now, this legislation expands such loopholes.\u201cIt\u2019s surprising to me that no real attempt was made to close any of these loopholes,\u201d said Mr. Wamhoff, given that \u201cvirtually every nonpartisan tax expert agrees that commercial real estate is already so favored by the tax code.\u201d Even Democrats, for the most part, have remained silent.Perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be so surprising, given that the president is the real-estate-investor-in-chief, and that his personal interests align with one of the country\u2019s most powerful lobbies.\u201cReal estate interests are very powerful when it comes to the tax laws,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got bipartisan support, and it\u2019s been that way forever.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misspelled the given name of a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. He is Stephen Wamhoff, not Steven (but his preference is Steve).videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Museum Leader Who Resigned Calls Controversy a \u2018Misunderstanding\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn her first interview since stepping down, Ms. Ruf told The New York Times by email that the private consulting work at the center of the accusations against her had been approved by the museum\u2019s board, and that claims of a conflict of interest were baseless.Ms. Ruf also said that funds paid to her consulting company came largely from a bonus of 1 million Swiss Francs, or about $1 million, given by a former employer for work completed before she started at the Stedelijk, the city\u2019s leading museum of contemporary art and design. She added that she resigned because she felt the ongoing negative publicity surrounding her side activities was harmful to the museum.The investigation led to concerns that Ms. Ruf was earning money outside of her government-subsidized income, raising the question of whether her work as museum director could be compromised by the competing interests of her private clients. Choices that museum directors make about exhibitions affect the market value of works of art, and if the director is simultaneously advising private clients, the ethical lines can become blurred.Ms. Ruf\u2019s sudden departure, accompanied by only very general public statements from Stedelijk officials and, until now, just a single quote from Ms. Ruf in a news release, had cast a shadow on her reputation and left lingering concerns about the Stedelijk board\u2019s ability to govern with transparency. The situation has also raised broader questions about the accountability of government-owned Dutch cultural institutions, which are substantially funded by the state and owe the public explanations of their policies and practices.Ms. Ruf agreed to an exclusive interview by email with The Times, saying that she hoped to clarify her role in what she called a \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d She advised that her responses would be vetted by her lawyers before being sent to The Times.All of her side activities were \u201ccontractually approved by the Stedelijk\u201d before she took the job, Ms. Ruf wrote. Throughout her responses, she said several times, \u201cI am confident that I reported everything in good faith.\u201dMadeleine de Cock Buning, the acting chairwoman of the museum\u2019s supervisory board was forwarded Ms. Ruf\u2019s comments and replied by email saying that the board had begun two independent investigations. \u201cWe have decided not to answer questions of the media while the investigations are going on,\u201d she added.Mark Reutter, who was chairman of the Kunsthalle\u2019s board at the time, said that her contract with the Kunsthalle allowed her to do outside work as an art adviser and consultant. The Kunsthalle does not have its own collection and does not purchase artworks, so there was no potential conflict of interest.Ms. Ruf\u2019s primary side activity while employed by the Kunsthalle was working as a salaried art adviser to the wealthy Swiss publisher and art collector Michael Ringier, who, over 20 years, collected a trove of more than 4,000 works of contemporary art with Ms. Ruf\u2019s help.When she was offered the job at the Stedelijk, Ms. Ruf wanted to continue this kind of art advisory work, she said, adding that she had sought and received approval from the museum\u2019s board to do so. She said she then established Currentmatters for this purpose.The Stedelijk\u2019s most recent annual report lists 18 \u201cadditional functions\u201d that Ms. Ruf provided, such as acting as a jurist for international art prizes, advising or serving on boards of art institutions in Moscow, Rome, Vienna and Dhaka, Bangladesh, and advising the American bank Goldman Sachs on their corporate art collection in London.\u201cBut there\u2019s a big difference if the board allowed her to do that and they knew what was happening,\u201d he added. \u201cIf the supervisory board allowed the director to do something, and it turns out to be not a good choice, then the board may have to resign.\u201dMr. Houben added that the Stedelijk building is owned by the city of Amsterdam, and the city and the Dutch state finance the institution. \u201cSo if you work there you have to be aware that you work with public money and behind the public money are public values, and that means you work for the public and not for your private interest,\u201d he said.Under a rule in the code of ethics called \u201ccomply or explain,\u201c he added, it\u2019s fine for an organization to make its own special arrangements that deviate from the code, but it recommends that the institution inform the public about it in its annual report or some other public document. \u201cI don\u2019t see any place where the board communicates that they don\u2019t follow the code,\u201d Mr. Houben said.In 2015, Currentmatters reported a profit of about $500,000 to the Dutch tax authorities, but Ms. Ruf said that the number was misleading: \u201cMany people wrongly assumed these profits came from side activities conducted in 2015 while I was artistic director of the Stedelijk Museum,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, this profit statement reflects legitimate income from activities conducted before 2015, primarily a parting bonus for past work from the Ringier Collection in the amount of 1 million Swiss Francs.\u201dMs. Ruf said that her actual earnings from \u201capproved side activities\u201d were 104,000 euros, or around $120,000, per year in 2015 and 2016. She said that the \u20ac378,000 she reported in 2015, and \u20ac628,000 that she earned in 2016 came from \u201cactivities conducted before 2015,\u201d and primarily reflected the bonus from Mr. Ringier. On Wednesday, Ms. Ruf is required to report her 2016 earnings to the Chamber of Commerce in the Netherlands and these figure will become publicly available.Mr. Ringier confirmed in a phone interview that he had given Ms. Ruf the \u201cthank you gift\u201d of 1 million francs, paid in installments over 2015 and 2016. He said that he did this because Ms. Ruf added value \u201cin the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions\u201d to his collection.\u201cThe money that I think everybody talks about in this company is the money she got for the 20 years of work for us,\u201d Mr. Ringier said. \u201cIt had nothing to do with an ongoing advisorship.\u201d\u201cWe absolutely wanted to avoid a conflict of interest,\u201d Mr. Ringier said.Even though Ms. Ruf said the Stedelijk\u2019s board had approved her side activities for the Ringier collection, she said that she and Mr. Ringier decided it would be best if they no longer worked together, and she sent her last invoice in December 2014.The Stedelijk\u2019s board did not respond to questions about whether Ms. Ruf reported to the museum that she received the bonus from Mr. Ringier. Ms. Ruf declined to comment on that question.In spite of what she said were efforts to report everything in good faith, questions remained about whether her arrangement with the Stedelijk from the beginning followed international and national codes of ethics.Mijntje L\u00fcckerath-Rovers, a professor of corporate governance at Tilburg University and the chairman of the committee that drafted the code of ethics for arts professionals in the Netherlands, said in a phone interview, \u201cIf there was some logical explanation, they could have said, \u2018Sorry that we were not that transparent in the beginning, we now want to be as transparent as possible, and here is what happened.\u2019 \u201d In that case, she said, Ms. Ruf could have kept her job.The absence of any such explanation \u201cdoes give the outside world, including me, the idea that something is not completely right,\u201d Professor L\u00fcckerath-Rovers said. \u201cFrom my perspective, transparency is lacking here and that\u2019s the most important thing, especially because you\u2019re working with public money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For a while she had a home in Buckhead, in a desirable northern section of Atlanta. Now she and her husband, Sam, live in Ansely Park, in midtown Atlanta.As her career was growing, so was the city, becoming more prosperous and attractive for companies looking to hire people, from relative newcomers, like CNN, which arrived in 1980, to hometown stars like Coca-Cola, which began nearly 100 years earlier, and Delta Air Lines, which arrived in 1941.Yet in 2000, after the dot-com crash, Ms. Allen began to have a change of heart. \u201cI had this gnawing feeling that I had to switch horses,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t come from wealth.\u201dShe realized that she had been living in a bubble. It was a nice bubble, with all the comforts and convenience her wealth could support. But it was a bubble nonetheless, one marked by homogeneity and an extreme distance, physical and emotional, from where she grew up, but also from people not as wealthy as she was.She began working to help neighborhoods that were struggling; some of those efforts succeeded, some did not. Last year, she and her husband joined a group of affluent residents to give money and time to Thomasville Heights, a very poor area of about 4,000 people.,\u201cAnsley Park is a privileged bubble within the town,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first time we visited Thomasville Heights and found out about the desperation people felt, we met there in a rec center. After our meeting we found out we had been on lockdown. There was a shooter outside. I felt very unsettled, which was the entire point. It was just a few miles away.\u201dEconomic inequality is a well-known issue in the United States and around the developed world. Not only has a gulf grown between the haves and the have-nots, but so has the gap between the haves and the have-mores.An outgrowth of this has been the creation of gilded ghettos. While far nicer and more comfortable than their urban counterparts, these gilded ghettos similarly narrow the vision of the people who live in them and their understanding of people outside of them. They also set their residents on a trajectory in life that is hard to stray from.In this case, these gilded ghettos are perpetuating wealth, a sense of safety and access to great education. A byproduct is that they often unintentionally exclude others from those same opportunities.Mr. Florida is referring to neighborhoods mixed by income and occupation. His father was a factory worker, but lived next door to his uncle who was an executive at Colgate-Palmolive.\u201cThey were best buddies,\u201d Mr. Florida said. \u201cMy dad was poorer. My uncle was richer. My dad was a Democrat, but my uncle was a Republican. That\u2019s unimaginable today. They wouldn\u2019t live next to each other.\u201dHe said in the 1970s 70 percent of people lived in middle-class neighborhoods, but today only 40 percent do.The effect is that people in different socioeconomic groups do not spend time with one another. That lack of contact causes different points of view for sure, but it also leads to very different outcomes in life.\u201cWe used to think of these divides as city and suburbs, with the poor in the city and the rich in the suburbs,\u201d Mr. Florida said. \u201cBut the truth of the matter is we have this patchwork of concentrated affluence surrounded by much larger areas of concentrated disadvantage. The interesting thing is this wealth divide is not city-suburb anymore. It\u2019s chock-a-block. We look more like a third-world country, where poor and rich are bumped up against each other.\u201dBefore he became president, Donald Trump had a life that was defined by the gilded ghetto he created for himself. He lived and worked in Trump Tower, the Manhattan skyscraper he developed and opened in 1983. He ate at restaurants he knew, like the \u201c21\u201d Club. When he traveled, he went by private plane. He spent time at the resorts and golf clubs he owned.Now even wealthier people are buying apartments that stretch into the sky on Manhattan\u2019s so-called Billionaires\u2019 Row along Central Park South. For a reported $220 million, Kenneth Griffin, the founder of the hedge fund Citadel, bought a four-floor condominium with a view of Central Park.That building and others that have gone up are filled with apartments costing $30 million or more.Even if these are extreme examples, that walling off is solidified, even among people closer in income level and occupation. Bay Colony, a development in affluent Naples, Fla., is separated from the rest of the high-end Pelican Bay development by its own gate \u2014 in other words, a gated community within a gated community.On the one hand, such gating allows people to spend time with exactly the type of people they have the most in common with; on the other hand it creates an echo chamber of beliefs and expectations that further separates the have-mores from everyone else.\u201cIf you had $10 million, the first thing people think is you\u2019d be able to do the things important to you,\u201d said Paul K. Piff, an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cYou get yourself more space. You choose to live in a neighborhood with other like-minded people. You can curate your life in so many different ways that make it more comfortable.\u201cBut at the same time it becomes this physical and psychological barrier between you and the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Piff added. \u201cThat can slowly erode our natural psychological tendencies to orient toward others. It\u2019s a basic component of empathy. It helps you see their common humanity. Without that concept you don\u2019t have that empathy.\u201dMs. Allen didn\u2019t grow up in a wealth bubble. Her father immigrated from Italy and worked construction jobs in Chicago before starting his own company.That group has committed to spending $350,000 over two years, with a focus on practical things like increasing school attendance and parental involvement and decreasing how often people change homes and schools. The group\u2019s goal, Ms. Allen said, is modest: to help these children get a bit further up the socioeconomic ladder.\u201cI ended up in a lucrative field,\u201d Ms. Allen said. \u201cWe worked hard, yes. But plenty of people work hard, and they\u2019re not getting anywhere, and they don\u2019t have the kinds of jobs that are lucrative.\u201dWhile such charitable efforts aim to make improvement, they are limited in their impact. What they cannot do is give disadvantaged children the networks that their more prosperous peers have.\u201cYou could go from Mill Valley about five minutes and be in an area in San Rafael where families are jammed together in a single one-bedroom apartment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the deal is they rent it by a third of a day. You have that room or couch for eight hours \u2014 and that\u2019s a five-minute drive from some of the most gorgeous homes in America where people could get lost in the house.\u201dMr. Peters said some of the work of the foundation was to bridge the divide between Silicon Valley wealth and the poverty in other parts of the county through grants, but also access to its donor networks. The 400 families involved with the foundation have given $1.3 billion and have another $1.7 billion committed to give.\u201cWe can address the fact that there are thousands of kids here who have all the natural ability and biologically vested intelligence to do spectacularly in life, but whose opportunities to do so are restricted,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Peters is cognizant that the children who benefit from grants and the mentorship of successful donors are the lucky few. It is not something, in the parlance of the region, that is scalable.\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to admit that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s what we have. It\u2019s what we can do. Absent the answer to a grand plan, this is a good plan.\u201dYet Mr. Novogratz said he and his wife were the exception to the rule when they began moving from their middle-class roots in the 1980s to the exclusive world they now inhabit.\u201cSocial mobility in the country has gone down, not up,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of it is, it\u2019s harder to get into the schools and the jobs that create these robust networks of opportunity.\u201d\u201cThese kids are taking two subways and a bus to get to practice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get them into college. The wrestling world becomes a network for them. It\u2019s very tough for that group to get that jump forward. We\u2019ll cherry pick a couple of kids each year, and they\u2019ll go to Stanford, Princeton or the Air Force academy.\u201dCorrecting the effect of these gilded ghettos on people not fortunate to live, work and raise children in them may not be easy.Mr. Florida is resigned to America remaining divided and hopes for a mutual respect among socioeconomic groups that do not live side by side.\u201cWe\u2019re now so sorted into different geographies that the best we can hope for is a mutual coexistence,\u201d he said. \u201cClustering is what drives people. You\u2019re not going to unify people.\u201dInstead, he thinks Americans who are aware of this wealth divide can do worse than emulate Canada. Forget the idea of the melting pot, he said. \u201cIn Canada, we always consider the country a mosaic. It\u2019s respect our differences, our identity and become more of a Canadian dream.\u201dMr. Piff of the University of California is more optimistic. He is hoping that finding ways to foster connections across class lines can help rich and poor to understand each other better.\u201cPeople empathize with the people they want to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of threatening to our social values to acknowledge that perhaps people might find themselves in positions they didn\u2019t deserve or in situations they didn\u2019t cause. It\u2019s easier for someone who believes the world is a meritocracy to empathize with someone who clearly didn\u2019t bring something on themselves, like Syrian refugees.\u201dHis suggestion is to draw from early work on race relations and create opportunities for contact among people who live in vastly different economic worlds.\u201cWriting checks and volunteering reinforces the gap between you and someone who is receiving your care,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are benefits to making just one good friend who is different than you, one friend who gets you to see yourself in their eyes, to humanize their experience. You extrapolate from your friend to the broader world around you.\u201dThat connection, at least from the Atlanta example, can change people\u2019s views. Brian Friedman, an adviser to wealthy families, and his wife, Vanessa, a college professor, live in Tucker, Ga., an Atlanta suburb with a median income of $64,388. They had focused their charity internationally until they visited Thomasville Heights, which they had never seen in over two decades of living in Atlanta.\u201cPeople would say, \u2018They should just work harder, this is the United States\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we found is that just isn\u2019t true. There are people living in our backyard with developing-world standards.\u201dThe group brought together from the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta knows it could take a decade or more to help improve Thomasville Heights. But he said last year the amount of moving among apartments was down, and the number of people showing up at parent teacher conferences, a focal point of affluent neighborhoods, went from 10 to 80.\u201cWe can\u2019t take credit for all of it,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. \u201cBut at least we\u2019re helping the schools.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the year CNN arrived in Atlanta. It was 1980, not 1986.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Republicans Scramble to Find Revenue for Tax Bill With Vote Expected Friday", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 The Senate will not vote on its tax bill tonight. It will convene at 10 a.m. Friday to continue the debate on taxes.\u2022 Republicans are considering raising some taxes down the road to help offset the cost of their tax bill after the Senate parliamentarian rejected the idea of a trigger that would have automatically increased taxes if economic growth fell short of projections.\u2022 Congress\u2019s bipartisan tax referee said that economic growth induced by the tax cut would only offset $458 billion of its cost over the next decade. The analysis put the bill\u2019s total price at $1 trillion, contradicting the Republican argument that the measure would essentially pay for itself.\u2022 Earlier in the day, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who had been undecided about the bill, said he would vote yes, but Senator Susan Collins of Maine said she remained undecided.\u2022 Though Republicans sound optimistic, party leaders still do not have firm commitments from enough senators to ensure the bill will pass.Senate Republicans are scrambling to figure out how to offset the deficit effects of the bill after the Senate parliamentarian rejected a trigger mechanism that would have automatically increased taxes if economic growth projections were not met. Several Republican senators, including Bob Corker of Tennessee, have expressed concerns about piling up debt as a result of the tax overhaul.One idea being discussed is reinstating the alternative minimum tax on some corporations and individuals. There is also discussion about increasing the corporate tax rate above the 20 percent after a period of years. This could involve slowly raising the rate after some time, though it is unclear when it would take place.Senate Republicans\u2019 tax cut would not pay for itself, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.The committee, which serves as the nonpartisan scorekeeper for growth and revenue estimates in tax bills, estimated that the Senate bill would boost economic growth by 0.8 percent over a decade. Republicans have said they expect substantially stronger growth than that to result from the tax cuts.Throughout the tax debate over the last month, Republican leaders have frequently cited other analyses by the committee in order to make their case for the bill.The committee said economic growth generated by the tax cut will offset losses by about $458 billion over the next decade. Over that same period, an additional $51 billion would be needed for interest costs.\u201cOverall, the budgetary effects of changes in economic growth are projected to reduce the deficit by $407 billion during the budget window,\u201d the committee said.A spokeswoman for Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who leads the Finance Committee, said the joint committee\u2019s analysis understates the actual economic growth and is not based on the current version of the bill.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said the analysis \u201cends the fantasy about magical growth and claims that tax cuts pay for themselves.\u201d\u201cWhat it proves is that this bill offers very little other than a holiday bonanza to multinational corporations and special interests,\u201d he said.Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona who was the deciding vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act, said on Thursday that he will vote in favor of the Senate tax cut bill.\u201cI believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle class families,\u201d Mr. McCain said in a statement.Some Republicans were worried that Mr. McCain could vote against the bill because of his sour relationship with President Trump. But Mr. McCain said that he was satisfied that the tax overhaul went through \u201cregular order\u201d in the Senate, with sufficient public hearings and opportunities for amendments.While he said he remained concerned about the deficit and acknowledged that the tax bill is not perfect, Mr. McCain said that on balance it would be good for the country. \u201cIt\u2019s clear this bill\u2019s net effect on our economy would be positive,\u201d Mr. McCain said.Senator Susan Collins remains a key senator to watch, given she has yet to commit to the bill and could be the deciding vote between a tax bill that passes and one that fails. On Thursday, Ms. Collins outlined some of her priorities and concerns at a breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor.On her vote:Ms. Collins said she remained concerned about the effect of the Senate plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act mandate that most Americans buy insurance or pay a penalty and also wanted to ensure that taxpayers could continue to deduct some state and local taxes, a provision known as SALT.\u201cThe SALT amendment is extremely important to me. The health care agreement is extremely important for me. It would be very difficult for me to support the bill if I do not prevail on those two issues,\u201d she said.Ms. Collins said that as of Thursday morning she was optimistic about the measures after conversations with President Trump and Senate leaders.Still, \u201cI am not committed to vote for this bill because who knows what is going to happen on the Senate floor.\u201dOn the corporate tax rate:Ms. Collins said she was open to nudging the corporate tax rate above the 20 percent currently envisioned in the Senate bill.\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to go to 20 percent on the corporate tax side,\u201d she said. Senators have begun discussions about raising the rate to 22 percent, which would still be a big cut from the current 35 percent corporate tax rate.On automatic spending cuts that could be required by tax bill:\u201cI strongly oppose that. I have written a letter to Mitch McConnell asking what is the plan to avert that. I met with Senator McConnell just yesterday and he has assured me that will not be allowed to happen.\u201dMs. Collins said she expected that a waiver of the so-called Paygo requirements would be included in a year-end spending bill.On an amendment that would close the carried interest loophole:\u201cI would make refundable the tax credit for child or adult dependent care. I would pay for it by closing the loophole on carried interest.\u201dThe Senate tax bill has been marketed by Republicans as a tax cut for the middle class. How would people in your income group fare?The politically powerful Koch network warned Republican senators on Thursday not to adopt a last-minute change to their tax bill that helps low-income parents in exchange for a slightly smaller cut in the corporate tax rate.Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah have filed an amendment to the bill that would allow low-income workers to use an expanded child tax credit to offset payroll taxes, not just income taxes; the distinction matters for families that do not currently face income tax liability. The senators propose paying for the move by reducing the corporate rate to 22 percent instead of 20 percent from the current 35 percent rate.Mr. Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said he did not believe there was any willingness on the House side to increase the corporate rate above 20 percent.\u201cI think we believe that is a rate that makes us, America, much more competitive, and we know from studies that had we had that rate, we\u2019d have many more jobs and businesses and facilities here in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we continue to stay focused on the 20 percent.\u201dJust a reminder that if the Senate passes its tax bill, it will need to reconcile the differences with the House version before a final bill can be sent to Mr. Trump.The Senate cleared a procedural hurdle on Wednesday with its vote to begin debating the tax bill, and early remarks from lawmakers offered a preview of what that debate will probably center on.\u201cThis is an historic day as the Senate begins consideration of tax reform that will help boost America\u2019s economy, that will create more jobs and that will leave more money in people\u2019s paychecks,\u201d Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and the chairman of the Budget Committee, said on Wednesday.Mr. Enzi offered a warning about the coming debate.\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to hear a lot of screaming going on in speeches this week,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t confuse volume with veracity or truth.\u201dMr. Wyden offered another kind of warning.\u201cThe Senate is 20 hours of debate away from a broken promise of truly historic proportions,\u201d he said on Wednesday. This year, he said, was supposed to be when \u201cthe working people of America regained a powerful voice in Washington.\u201d\u201cInstead of a strong voice, what they got instead was a big con job,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cIf this Republican tax bill passes, Washington is going to reach into the pockets of working Americans and cut a big check to multinational corporations, to tax cheats and to the politically powerful and well-connected.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, criticized Republicans for how they had undertaken the tax overhaul, complaining that they had shut out Democrats as they put together their bill.Mr. Schumer said the Republican tax bill had made \u201ca mockery of the legislative process,\u201d and he pleaded for Republicans to work with Democrats on taxes instead of moving forward with the current tax plan.\u201cIf my Republican friends close the door on their partisan tax bill tonight,\u201d he said, \u201cthey will find an open door for bipartisan tax reform tomorrow.\u201dThe administration pledged official support on Thursday for the tax bill pending in the Senate, an unsurprising move that confirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to a Missouri crowd on Wednesday that he would sign the bill if it reached his desk.\u201cThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage\u201d of the bill, officials wrote in a statement of administrative policy, because it would reduce taxes for businesses and middle class families and simplify the tax code. The statement also praised provisions in the bill to repeal the individual health insurance mandate under the Affordable Care Act and to open part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling.If the bill were presented to Mr. Trump, the statement said, \u201chis advisers would recommend that he sign the bill into law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sound of Music Through El Sistema Kenya", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Though Faith Syovata had almost lost her voice because of a cold, the students still hung on her every whispered word. With violins tucked under their chins, the 14-year-olds at Kawangware Primary School here had their bows at the ready as she pointed out notes for the song on the blackboard.As the students began to play, the music was a bit out of tune, but there was no dismissing their passion and eagerness for performing. Three times a week for two hours these 20 or so children, as well as a younger group that the teenagers help mentor, get violin classes through the El Sistema Kenya (ESK) program. It takes its name from the El Sistema music program, which was founded in 1975 in Venezuela by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Abreu, an economist and conductor.Over the years, El Sistema in Venezuela has developed into a social program aimed at helping disadvantaged youth through music instruction and has inspired music educators globally.For the teens in Kawangware, a slum in west Nairobi, the classes are something they look forward to each week. Gibson Gathiru, a short, slim boy with big eyes, said that he was amazed when he was first introduced to the violin. \u201cIt was,\u201d he said, \u201cthe first instrument that I wanted to know.\u201dAsha Ibrahim said that when her parents first heard about the program, which began in September 2014, \u201cthey thought it was something stupid.\u201d However, she said, over time they have changed their minds. \u201cThis is an ordinary place,\u201d she said of her neighborhood. \u201cWho knew something like this kind of music could be happening here?\u201dIn January, a new program will begin in Juja, about 18 miles from Nairobi, where 20 children ages 3 to 12 from a local orphanage will be taught recorder and sing in a choir. \u201cThe kids have been the most fun aspect,\u201d Elly Owidi, a clarinet teacher who helps coordinate the Juja program, said in an email. \u201cTheir energy, their commitment, interest and growth are what keep me going.\u201dWhen Karis Crawford, a classically trained violinist from Michigan, first arrived in Kenya she had never heard about El Sistema. She had come to the country to teach at an international school in the Rift Valley and soon began volunteering on weekends, giving music lessons to children in a Nairobi slum.She was also asked to be the director of strings with the Kenya National Youth Orchestra, and after watching a documentary on El Sistema she was inspired.\u201cOne of the main reasons was that I saw the Kenyan public education system didn\u2019t give kids much hope or job prospects, especially for kids based in slums,\u201d said Ms. Crawford, who has a master\u2019s in education from Boston University. \u201cPublic schools didn\u2019t teach critical thinking, problem-solving or creativity, and I knew that a music program like El Sistema could fill this gap.\u201dShe began reading about other global programs that had been inspired by the work in Venezuela, which, during the 1980s and \u201990s, started popping up across South America. Sistema-inspired programs really boomed internationally after its concert arm \u2014 the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Gustavo Dudamel, an El Sistema alumnus and music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic \u2014 wowed international audiences during a performance at the BBC Proms in 2007.According to Eric Booth, the co-author of \u201cPlaying for Their Lives: The Global El Sistema Movement for Social Change Through Music,\u201d there are now over 400 programs around the world, involving a million children.Ms. Crawford spent a few months with a local program in Michigan and learned the intricacies of running a project. She also reached out to El Sistema in Venezuela to see if she could use their name. \u201cThey don\u2019t officially say \u2018yes, you are an El Sistema program,\u2019 because El Sistema is more an idea,\u201d she said.Ms. Crawford started a Kickstarter campaign and was able to get donations of instruments for her program from a number of friends and contacts. \u201cI started to bring instruments from the States, with people saying, \u2018Oh, I have a violin in my attic and I never use it, do you want it?\u2019 \u201d she said with a laugh.\u201cI would always bring a donated violin into my suitcase and actually the record we had was eight in one suitcase.\u201d She set up master classes with Kenya youth orchestra musicians and alums, training them to run the program; those volunteers still make up the majority of her tutors.\u201cRecently we had to close a branch in Waithaka slums since the one volunteer posted there could no longer continue,\u201d Ms. Syovata said. \u201cI am only alone at Kawangware; it has been difficult to get more people willing to join and teach.\u201dAt first, teachers in the school and parents were skeptical \u2014 a number of those in the Kawangware community had never heard a violin played. \u201cIt was hard because to be established in the community, we had to have the community behind us,\u201d Ms. Crawford said. \u201cSo if they see a teacher carrying a violin around, they will be like \u2018oh, that is one of the El Sistema teachers.\u2019 \u201dIt must have worked, as the concerts were packed with people from the community. She hopes to get more consistent financing to pay her volunteer teachers and expand the program to add a string orchestra at the school. \u201cAnd those kids know that when they go to Kawangware Primary School, they will learn the violin,\u201d she said.While it\u2019s hard to argue that children\u2019s lives don\u2019t benefit from the music education, there is a growing debate among academics, music education experts and program directors over just how much these programs really effect change in everything from grades to psychological and social development.\u201cYou can look at two different programs and they are completely different things,\u201d said Geoffrey Baker, author of \u201cEl Sistema: Orchestrating Venezuela\u2019s Youth.\u201d \u201cSo what links it is basically a brand and a whole industry around it where all sorts of institutions are built up on the back of this making money, like concert halls, artists agencies, universities and conservatories.\u201dMs. Crawford acknowledges her critics and admitted it was hard to quantify the educational benefits of the program.\u201cWe are hoping one day to have the data to prove that El Sistema\u2019s approach in Kenya has a direct relationship with kids improving their lives and their communities in way not possible through other means,\u201d she said. \u201cOur students in Kawangware tell us what happens after school without our program and it\u2019s frightening and sad \u2014 with our program they keep off the streets and learn new skills that give them hope.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Search for Proof Their Tax Plans Will Pay for Themselves", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican leaders keep insisting that their plans to cut taxes by $1.5 trillion over the next decade will not add to the national debt \u2014 yet economic analyses of the Senate and House proposals keep predicting that the plans will do just that.The disconnect is prompting House and Senate Republican leaders and the Trump administration to hunt down \u2014 and promote \u2014 more optimistic forecasts, even if they exclude large parts of the tax bills from their analyses or assume growth-boosting features that are not, in fact, in the bills.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a political organization, you\u2019re constantly model shopping,\u201d said Kent Smetters, a former economic adviser in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, who is now the faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania.In an interview on Friday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said that \u201cwe\u2019re confident that the $1.5 trillion gap would be filled\u201d by economic growth. Mr. McConnell said the tax bill would add 0.4 percentage points to annual economic growth, though he did not cite a specific analysis suggesting that assertion. \u201cSo we believe this is a responsible budget and a responsible tax reform,\u201d he said.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin insisted last week that the House bill would not add to the deficit, even after an analysis by the independent Tax Foundation, which uses a model that tends to find large growth effects from tax cuts, found that the bill would add $1 trillion to deficits over a decade.\u201cWe believe that we\u2019re going to be fine on that,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cWe believe that when you look at other analysis, whether it\u2019s going to be Treasury or the rest, that we\u2019re right there in the sweet spot, with economic growth that gives us more revenue with where we need to be.\u201dThe House is preparing to vote on a tax overhaul bill this week, while the Senate Finance Committee begins amending a companion version, as part of a whirlwind push to deliver tax legislation to President Trump\u2019s desk by Christmas.The Treasury Department has not yet released any economic analysis of the congressional plans. Economists at Goldman Sachs said last month that they expect tax cuts to generate enough additional growth to offset about a fifth of their revenue losses. That means $1 trillion of net tax cuts would lose $800 billion on a dynamic basis.Dynamic scoring is inexact in the best of circumstances. Under the compressed congressional schedule this fall, it is even more difficult, said Alan J. Auerbach, a University of California, Berkeley, economist who is widely considered a godfather of modern dynamic scoring models.As a result, only a few models have churned out consistent dynamic analyses that attempt to account for all the provisions of the House and Senate bills. The Tax Foundation has one. Mr. Smetters and his Penn Wharton team have another. Perhaps the most important scorekeeper on that front, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, is due to weigh in this week, with an analysis of the bill pending in the House.Ironically, the models that so far have produced the least optimistic forecasts for the Republican plan are the ones that most closely track the assumptions conservatives have long espoused about the economy: that racking up deficits and debt will hold back growth.That is the case with the Penn Wharton model, which finds that the House bill would lose between $1 trillion and $1.7 trillion over a decade in revenue, after accounting for growth, depending on various assumptions about the flow of investment dollars in the global economy and the growth-stoking power of tax cuts. The Tax Foundation\u2019s more optimistic model projects the Senate bill would lose $500 billion in revenue after growth effects.The one model so far to suggest that the bills could fully pay for themselves comes from a Boston University economist, Laurence J. Kotlikoff, who employs what he calls a more comprehensive view of the global economy\u2019s dynamics than other economists do. Mr. Kotlikoff\u2019s analysis finds large growth effects from the House and Senate\u2019s plans to cut top corporate tax rates to 20 percent from 35 percent today. It makes some growth-boosting assumptions that differ from the bills as drafted, and it essentially excludes the impacts of personal income tax changes on the economy; other models find those changes would affect growth and revenue.Mr. Kotlikoff\u2019s approach has been criticized by several liberal economists, including Jason Furman, a former top economist for President Barack Obama, who now gives slide-show presentations on what he calls the \u201cseven deadly sins of overly optimistic dynamic scoring.\u201dMr. Kotlikoff\u2019s model commits several of those sins, Mr. Furman said, including Sin No. 2: \u201cUse estimates from \u2018similar\u2019 tax plans that are not similar.\u201dLast week, Mr. Kotlikoff was on the phone with a reporter, explaining the intricacies of his model, when a call came in on the other line from a staff member of the House Ways and Means Committee.\u201cThey\u2019re interested because it supports their view, right?\u201d Mr. Kotlikoff said, referring to the Ways and Means staff member. He then resumed explaining why that should be the case \u2014 why his model was better than others at predicting the path of growth.Mr. Auerbach, who has teamed up with Mr. Kotlikoff on past tax studies, but not the current effort, said he was skeptical that the Republican plans would generate enough growth and revenue to pay for themselves. \u201cTo say that it might happen is one thing,\u201d he said. \u201cTo say you expect it to happen is quite different.\u201dMr. Auerbach cautioned that he was speaking from informed opinion \u2014 and not from the results of any modeling.Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Day Wall Street Collapsed", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Diana B. Henriques is an award-winning financial journalist and a best-selling chronicler of the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme. Her new book focuses on a 30-years-ago crisis \u2014 the Black Monday debacle of 1987 when the stock market turned in a one-day loss that, on a percentage basis, was almost twice as large as the steepest drop in 1929. In making her case for the importance of the 1987 crash, Henriques has produced a valuable and unfailingly interesting account of a crucial two-decade period in Wall Street history \u2014 when markets made a full-bore transition from serving individual investors to a system dominated by giant corporations, mostly trading for themselves, and competing by means of arcane computer algorithms and spectacular processing speeds.A portentous milestone was passed when the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or \u201cthe Merc,\u201d started trading financial futures on a host of instruments \u2014 Treasury note interest rates, government-issued mortgage bonds, foreign currencies and various stock index futures, like Value Line and the S & P 500 stock indexes. After a jurisdictional catfight between the C.F.T.C. and the Securities Exchange Commission (S.E.C.), the regulators settled into an uneasy truce, although the Chicago institutions consistently outgunned the S.E.C. and the New York Stock Exchange in creativity and aggressiveness.LOR\u2019s product was a set of algorithms that clicked in during a market downturn to limit losses. When the insurance algorithms were triggered, computers would sell futures to lock in a pricing floor, and then reverse the process as markets recovered. The concept was simple, but its execution requirements were formidable.Skeptical customers asked what would happen if the markets didn\u2019t step up and buy futures at \u201crational\u201d prices. That was easily waved off. Yes, in panicky markets, the futures clearing prices might be lower than the rational price, but canny traders would soon recognize the bargains on offer. That glibly danced by a scarier issue, however \u2014 the sheer scale of portfolios that were protected by insurance. A truly serious downturn could trigger huge robotic futures sales that could overwhelm the capacities of the traders.And that duly happened on Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987. After several weeks of slipping markets, floods of computer-driven futures orders hit the Chicago markets, overwhelming their systems and driving a steep plunge in futures prices, many all the way to zero, which signaled no bids at all. As futures prices collapsed, the implacable insurance algorithms accelerated the selling. Henriques gives us a gripping, almost minute-by-minute account of the weeks that followed, including the posturings, the denials and the panics, as well as the \u201cweb of trust, pluck and improvisation\u201d that pulled the markets through.Summing up the crisis, Henriques places blame on \u201cdisparate, blindly competitive and increasingly automated markets \u2026 gigantic and increasingly like-minded institutional investors\u201d and \u201ca regulatory community that was poorly equipped, ridiculously fragmented, technologically na\u00efve and fatally focused on protecting turf.\u201dHenriques overstates her case, however, when she writes that \u201cmore than a trillion dollars in wealth had been lost.\u201d And she cites a comment from President Reagan at an impromptu news conference during the worst days of the crisis that \u201call the business indices are up. There is nothing wrong with the economy,\u201d which she compares to Herbert Hoover\u2019s complacency in 1930.Actually, Reagan was right. The economy was fine. From 1986 through 1989, real (inflation-adjusted) growth was 3.5 percent, 3.5 percent, 4.2 percent and 3.7 percent. The 1980s stock market was a roller coaster. It opened with historically low price-earnings ratios, which allowed canny leveraged buyout investors to snap up solid companies at bargain prices. As copycat investors flooded into the buyout markets, the quality of deals deteriorated \u2014 laughably, one major acquisition was insolvent on the day the deal closed. The trillion-dollar drop in market values was just a recognition of reality. The saps who took the losses were counterbalanced by the lucky investors who got their money out in time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Does German Conservatism Have a Future?", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Ever since Angela Merkel\u2019s center-right Christian Democrats lost one million voters to the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany in September, mainstream German conservatives have been in a panic. This is not just the usual blame game after a major electoral setback. It\u2019s a long-simmering crisis finally boiling over \u2014 and Ms. Merkel is at the heart of it.The past decades have put conservatism in Germany to an existential test. The grand currents of contemporary history in the Western world have smashed the shrine of its principles. Globalization and migration challenged the Christian Democrats\u2019 embrace of a German \u201cLeitkultur,\u201d the notion that there is a single, coherent \u201cleading culture.\u201d Urbanization has threatened its traditional rural strongholds. Secularization and ethnic diversity called into question the privileges of Christianity in public life. And trends toward gender equality and gay rights and the rise of the post-nuclear family have undermined the party\u2019s emphasis on traditional social values.Mrs. Merkel\u2019s answer to the many challenges during her 17 years as the party\u2019s leader was if you can\u2019t beat it, embrace it. She has allowed influential women in the party to modernize its view of the family. She overhauled the party\u2019s course on nuclear energy after the Fukushima disaster. She cautiously modernized the party\u2019s view on immigration and supported a greater public acceptance of Islam.Ms. Merkel\u2019s centrist course never went uncontested. Factions within her party, such as the so-called Berlin Circle of politicians, warned that conservatism was losing its substance. But they were muted by the obvious success of Ms. Merkel\u2019s strategy, and the lack of a true alternative. And the modernizers around Ms. Merkel argued that conservatism is not necessarily a bulletpoint list of tangible policy issues, but rather a method of policy making. Doing it the conservative way meant to \u201cdo the necessary to protect what you hold dear,\u201d as the party\u2019s secretary general, Peter Tauber, once put it; it meant moving forward without losing sight of what\u2019s worth keeping.In the face of the worst result in the party\u2019s history, however, many feel conservatism as a method, rather than a set of principles, is no longer enough, and that Merkelism has lost all meaning. Especially in light of the rise of the far right, they want to reclaim their party\u2019s focus on national identity and Leitkultur. The postelection crisis of German conservatism amounts to these questions: How \u201cdeutsch\u201d does conservatism have to be to win back voters from Alternative for Germany? And at what cost?To understand where German conservatism may be headed, look at Jens Spahn. A Christian Democrat in the Bundestag, Mr. Spahn is not a nationalist, but he believes that a certain dose of nationalism could have healing powers \u2014 healing for both public insecurities and his own party\u2019s misery. He is young, eloquent and ambitious, and an openly gay resident of Berlin. Political insiders consider him a potential successor to Ms. Merkel as the head of the Christian Democrats, if not as chancellor. He is too smart to indulge in the blunt copying of Alternative for Germany slogans that others in his party have taken to after the election. But he is aware of the power of political symbols and has supported a ban on wearing a burqa in public, as well as a ban on dual citizenship.Having served in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Spahn has a keen sense for Germany\u2019s economic, political and financial entanglement with the world. But though in many ways a member of the cosmopolitan German in-crowd, he is aware of its elitist tendency and its potential to divide the country.Unlike many politicians, he avoids easy answers. Campaigning for the Christian Democrats gave him plenty of opportunity to study Germany\u2019s state of mind, and in particular what one might call the need for cultural security. He favors a strong state that guarantees order and security, both in a tangible and \u201ccultural\u201d ways. People are sick of being judged for feeling afraid of cultural change, he recently said in a speech: \u201cWe have to say, \u201cWe understand.\u2019 \u201d In an interview he criticized the party leadership\u2019s plan to focus on social welfare as a response to the election rout: \u201cDoes anybody here really believe we lost 12 percent in the federal state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u201d \u2014 a wealthy southern state \u2014 \u201cbecause of issues like care for the elderly?\u201dMr. Spahn is right. Conservative German voters increasingly want a stronger state, one that sets clear boundaries on immigration and change, a state that follows the rules and makes everybody who lives here follow them too. Rules mean predictability. The average conservative voter wants that \u2014 and in recent years Ms. Merkel has given them anything but that.If German conservatives could convey that they take this need more seriously in the future, their crisis may well turn into an opportunity. The question remains, though, whether the rest of the country \u2014 the 45 percent who did not vote for a conservative party this year \u2014 will follow suit, or whether a renewed embrace of Leitkultur on the right will create new divisions among German voters. In an increasingly multicultural, globalized country, there\u2019s every reason to believe it will. In other words, Mr. Spahn may save German conservatism, but at what cost for Germany as a whole?An earlier version of this article misstated the number of voters the Christian Democratic Union lost to the Alternative for Germany in the 2017 federal elections. It was one million, not five million.Anna Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

For her birthday Mr. Shand initially had gotten what she called \u201cthe most insane piece\u201d at the shop but it turned out to be unwearable, so she exchanged it for the bright blue cuff, which looks like a wrist corsage.Ms. Powys said it works equally well with denim or a beautiful dress. \u201cPlus there is the whole flower and nature theme,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so delicate and feminine but also bright, colorful and happy.\u201dMr. Shand, who was an ambassador for Cartier, also gave her the steel Cartier Tank Fran\u00e7aise watch that Ms. Powys wears almost every day. \u201cI don\u2019t replace it with a plastic watch when I\u2019m in the field as it\u2019s so hardy and everything-proof,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can certainly hack a crocodile-infested, raging river, no problem.\u201dMr. Mavros had featured African elephants, but when Mr. Shand\u2019s family asked him to create two Asian elephant pins for distribution at the conservationist\u2019s memorial service, Ms. Powys said, he readily agreed.Now, she said, there are about 400 people who regularly wear the brooches, depicting a mother and baby elephant and a single \u201crogue tusker.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like owning a Land Rover or a vintage car,\u201d Ms. Powys said. \u201cYou\u2019re part of the club \u2014 the Mark Shand appreciation club.\u201dNot all her jewelry features elephants, though.There also is, as Ms. Powys described it, her \u201cplastic fantastic obsession\u201d for eye-poppingly bright costume pieces, the result of her fascination with a primary school teacher\u2019s jewelry. That influence can be seen in a yellow and black expandable cuff (a Christmas cracker prize) and a kitsch banana bracelet she picked up at a flea market in Paris.Plastic flowers are another favorite, including a pair of red Oscar de la Renta earrings and an oversize yellow set bought at Le Grand Magasin, a vintage shop in St.-R\u00e9my-de-Provence that specializes in mid-20th-century plastic designs.In July, Ms. Powys married Ramani Ganesh, a partner at Goldman Sachs who donates his salary to conservation initiatives, primarily Lion Guardians, which works to protect lions in East Africa. (Coincidentally, Ganesh is the Hindu elephant god.)Ms. Powys\u2019s engagement ring was a Burmese sapphire in an Art Deco-style setting. \u201cGanesh didn\u2019t like the idea of the diamond engagement ring and neither did I,\u201d she said, so he bought the deep-blue stone at Grays Antique Centre in Mayfair and commissioned a custom setting.Several of her pieces are from Indian designers, including her white-diamond wedding ring by Nirav Modi. It is from his Embrace collection, diamond and gold jewelry designed to stretch as the wearer puts it on and takes it off, something that Ms. Powys said really suits her active life and the hot climates she frequents.(Mr. Modi, a well-known Indian diamantaire, is set to donate pieces from his latest animal-inspired collection to Elephant Family\u2019s next fund-raiser.)\u201cI do sometimes look at myself and my jewelry and think I\u2019m a very unusual conservationist,\u201d Ms. Powys said. \u201cBut I like it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Generation of Character Actors", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "Once strictly supporting names, these performers have now emerged as key players in a changing Hollywood.Supported by\u201cA lot,\u201d Gerry replies.\u201cTo who?\u201d Curtis asks.Gerry looks around, gestures weakly at the bar and whispers, \u201cEveryone.\u201d Mendelsohn draws out this line, cracking a proud little smile, which transforms into a nervous grimace \u2014 as if he\u2019s sharing a secret better left unsaid. It\u2019s one of the most impressive eight seconds of film acting in recent years; with a single word, an actor pulls us into his character\u2019s anguished world.All actors play characters, of course, but only some are called \u201ccharacter actors.\u201d The term is contentious \u2014 performers rarely use it to describe their peers \u2014 yet it has persisted for more than a century. It first became common in 19th-century theater criticism to discuss actors who immersed themselves fully in their roles, often using realistic makeup to become unrecognizable. By the 1930s, the term had changed in Hollywood to refer to entertainers who played specific types: Walter Brennan as the leathery old codger, Ward Bond as the avuncular authority figure. \u201cMany character actors had created their archetypes in vaudeville or theater,\u201d says Bruce Goldstein, director of repertory programming at New York\u2019s Film Forum. \u201cHollywood was turning out so many movies that character actors allowed for a kind of shorthand \u2014 you didn\u2019t need a lot of exposition. It\u2019s why films of that era are so breezy.\u201dThese men also injected a note of humanity into what would otherwise have been broad, even stock, roles. \u201cYou recognize something concrete in them,\u201d wrote the critic Gilbert Seldes in a 1934 Esquire essay, \u201cThe Itsy-Bitsy Actors.\u201d Unlike a movie\u2019s charismatic leads, character actors could be \u201crude, violent, ironic, mean, brutal and mocking. They say what the audience often feels.\u201d For this, they didn\u2019t go unnoticed \u2014 Brennan won three Best Supporting Actor Oscars from 1936 to 1940, a feat no actor has since matched. By the 1980s, the definition of a character actor again had shifted, this time to include supporting players who were familiar without being famous: people like Jon Polito, Vincent Schiavelli, Xander Berkeley. (Don\u2019t recognize their names? Google their faces.) Occasionally, if he stuck around long enough, a character actor became an institution unto himself; look no further than the tributes to Harry Dean Stanton \u2014 known for playing grizzled oddballs \u2014 when he died in September.While there are many forces behind the rise of such performers, chief among them is the implosion of Hollywood\u2019s star system over the past two decades. The unchecked increase in movie-star salaries in the 1980s and 1990s led to a reckoning throughout the 2000s, as expensive talents like Harrison Ford, Tom Cruise and Eddie Murphy released films that vastly underperformed. Even Will Smith \u2014 once considered infallible \u2014 has struggled to achieve anything approaching the box-office triumphs of his mid-\u201990s heyday. Studios didn\u2019t respond to these deficits by cutting budgets, though; instead, they pursued increasingly extravagant franchises, many of which were engineered solely to manufacture new celebrities to replace the outdated models. These films varied in quality \u2014 some were admittedly entertaining \u2014 but they were formulaic when it came to plotting and casting.There\u2019s one other reason character actors are ascendant right now: When Hollywood stopped producing scripts of real merit, veteran filmmakers and screenwriters began making \u201cprestige\u201d television, which inadvertently became a training ground for these actors, much as theater once was. \u201cI like to say that television is about character and movies are about story,\u201d says Keith Gordon, an \u201980s-era character actor who now directs television, including \u201cHomeland\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d \u201cWith a film, you ask, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen?\u2019 With a TV show, you ask, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen to this character I like?\u2019\u2009\u201d Only great actors \u2014 those like Mendelsohn, who won a Lead Actor Emmy last year for his role in Netflix\u2019s \u201cBloodline\u201d \u2014 can bring the required depth to roles that are meant to encourage binge-watching: hours, if not days, spent with a character (and a person) who must be compelling enough to sustain the audience\u2019s interest and emotional engagement.Perhaps this isn\u2019t so different from The Itsy-Bitsy Actors that Seldes eulogized almost a century ago. They, too, had the ability to break through the confines of the screen to present feelings that were recognizably human. Yet those original character actors offered a brief respite from the uniformity of Hollywood\u2019s dream machine \u2014 they supported the stars, helped them tell their stories. Today, it\u2019s the character actors who viewers remember long after the rest has faded to black. And the only thing these supporting players are supporting is the weight of the industry itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Really Gets a Tax Increase if the Individual Mandate Goes Away?", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn government tables, it looks as if it\u2019s low-income people. But the real losers would be higher up the income scale.If Obamacare\u2019s requirement to have health insurance is revoked by Congress, some people will choose to go without it, and the government will save money because it won\u2019t have to pay to subsidize their plans. New estimates show that the mandate\u2019s repeal would give low-income Americans a big tax increase. But Republicans say that\u2019s not true. And they have a point. Meanwhile, left out of the tax tables is the fact that some higher earners, who look as if they are getting more of a tax cut, will get hit with higher insurance premiums if the mandate is repealed.The Congressional Budget Office currently estimates that eliminating Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate will cause 13 million more people to become uninsured, and save the government $338 billion over 10 years. Most Republican lawmakers don\u2019t really believe dropping the mandate would so severely lower the number of insured, a point they argued loudly when they were hoping to repeal Obamacare earlier this year. If they don\u2019t buy insurance and don\u2019t get the gift card, is that really the same thing as paying more in taxes? Republicans say it is not.\u201cNothing in our mark will impact the availability of premium subsidy credits,\u201d said Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, on Thursday, using a technical term for draft legislation. \u201cThis is the result of an assumption about economic behavior that is 100 percent voluntary.\u201dMr. Hatch has a point. The subsidies may count, technically, as tax benefits, but they are relatively unusual in the tax code, because they can be used only to buy health insurance. People who get insurance can get a gift card. People who don\u2019t get nothing. But if someone chooses not to buy insurance, does that mean they\u2019ve lost out financially?But others say that if customers valued health insurance, they would buy it.\u201cSince the credits go exclusively to pay the premium, it\u2019s a little weird,\u201d said Len Burman, an institute fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a research group that evaluates tax laws. A comparison of tax rates under the current law vs. the Senate tax bill\u2019s proposed changes.Another weird thing that Mr. Burman noted is that the more expensive health insurance gets, the bigger a tax increase the change appears to be in the government estimates. Under the Affordable Care Act, people below a certain income cap can\u2019t pay more than a percentage of their income to buy health insurance, so as prices go up, so do their subsidies. Economists think that lifting a requirement for healthy people to buy insurance will tend to make the resulting pool of customers sicker, driving up insurance premiums. But the actual cost of insurance for that group wouldn\u2019t increase. \u201cThe credits look more valuable, because the proposal sabotages the health market, and premiums go up,\u201d he said.But if the low-income people who won\u2019t get tax credits aren\u2019t clearly worse off financially \u2014 after all, they could claim them again if they choose to buy insurance \u2014 there\u2019s another group that is certain to suffer if the mandate goes away. Higher-income people, who don\u2019t qualify for government gift cards, have to pay the full price of health insurance. Single people earning more than about $48,000, or families of four earning more than around $98,000, earn too much to qualify for any insurance subsidies. Both Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Republican senators whose votes may be needed to pass the tax bill, have expressed some concern about the premium increases for this group as a kind of hidden middle-class tax increase. Those changes may not show up as increases on a government table the way the missing tax credits appear for their lower-income neighbors. But the effect on their bottom line may be more significant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Took On the Voting Rights Act and Won. Now He\u2019s Taking On Harvard.", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe was upset about how a state law had forced Poway to redo its voting districts so Latinos would have a better chance of winning elections.Reading the piece on his computer 3,000 miles away, Edward Blum knew he had found his newest case.Seeing one of his b\u00eates noires \u2014 racial gerrymandering \u2014 at work, Mr. Blum recruited the former mayor, Don Higginson, as a plaintiff, and on Oct. 4 filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the California Voting Rights Act.Mr. Blum is not a lawyer. But he is a one-man legal factory with a growing record of finding plaintiffs who match his causes, winning big victories and trying above all to erase racial preferences from American life.Mr. Blum said he was acting on a pure principle \u2014 that people should never be judged by the color of their skin.\u201cMost Americans don\u2019t want race to be part of your application to college,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the police to use race as a profiling tool to prevent crime. They don\u2019t want prosecutors to use race in the makeup of a jury. Your race and your ethnicity should not be something used to help you or harm you in your life\u2019s endeavors.\u201dHow a financial adviser without a law degree has managed to bring so many cases that make, as he calls it, \u201cbig law,\u201d is a testament to his methods. He is a matchmaker bringing together two forces: students and others who believe they are being mistreated in the name of racial justice, and conservative donors who finance his work and that of the high-powered, establishment Republican lawyers who take the cases to court.In the current environment, Mr. Blum has been called many things, including a courageous man of the moment willing to take on entrenched, politically correct policies, and a tool of rich conservatives trying to extinguish efforts to help historically oppressed minorities overcome the long shadow of racism.Rachel Kleinman, senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said that Mr. Blum\u2019s opposition to affirmative action was related to \u201cthis fear of white people that their privilege is being taken away from them and given to somebody else who they see as less deserving.\u201dPointing to his own upbringing and the anti-Semitism his family experienced in the South in the 1950s and \u201960s, when his father was a traveling salesman and some hotels did not accept Jewish guests, Mr. Blum said such criticism missed the mark.He recalled living in Orlando, Fla., when his family\u2019s synagogue received a bomb threat and the congregation asked a neighboring church to join it in forming a citizen patrol. The church refused \u2014 until, Mr. Blum said, his father called a bomb threat to the church.\u201cI seem to come from a line of compulsive people who believe in certain things and just don\u2019t let go of them easily,\u201d he said, smiling.His first lawsuit was a product of personal experience. Mr. Blum (pronounced Bloom) ran for Congress in Houston as a Republican in 1992, and lost. What bothered him most, he said, was the district\u2019s tortured shape, designed to make it easier for a minority candidate to win the seat. He filed a case claiming racial gerrymandering and nursed it to the Supreme Court, which ruled in his favor in 1996. He began to file similar suits in other states.That effort culminated in a challenge to the 1965 Voting Rights Act, in particular to the law\u2019s requirement that states and localities with a history of voting discrimination get permission from federal authorities before altering voting laws \u2014 so-called preclearance. Mr. Blum began searching the web for localities that had recently come under Justice Department scrutiny, and then cold-called Frank Ellis, the county attorney of Shelby County, Ala.Mr. Ellis was wary at first of Mr. Blum, but not of his cause. \u201cWe vetted him as best we could,\u201d Mr. Ellis said, and ultimately agreed to file a suit.In 1965, Mr. Ellis said, the county had a reading and writing test devised to keep blacks from voting. \u201cThere was no question there was something legitimate\u201d about the federal supervision, he said.\u201cBut in the last 20 years or so before we filed this suit, it became obvious to me that it was no longer justified,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe were having to spend pretty large amounts of taxpayer money that could have gone to something like schools on getting preclearance from the Justice Department.\u201dIn the Texas affirmative action case, he told a friend that he was looking for a white applicant to the University of Texas at Austin, his own alma mater, to challenge its admissions criteria. The friend passed the word to his daughter, Abigail Fisher. About six months later, the university rejected Ms. Fisher\u2019s application.\u201cI immediately said, \u2018Hey, can we call Edward?\u2019\u201d she recalled in an interview.The case went to the Supreme Court twice, and though Ms. Fisher was portrayed as a less than stellar student, vilified as supporting a racist agenda, and ultimately lost, she said she still believed in Mr. Blum. \u201cI think we started a conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cEdward obviously is not going to just lie down and play dead.\u201dFor much of the year, Mr. Blum works out of a gray-shingle house in South Thomaston, Me., overlooking Penobscot Bay, in a stark landscape famously painted by Andrew Wyeth. He has a consulting business analyzing esoteric municipal bonds for a handful of wealthy families.But hiring lawyers for his kind of litigation takes a lot of money, and Mr. Blum has found it.The goals of the Searle trust, as stated on its website, are to create \u201can environment that promotes individual freedom and economic liberties, while encouraging personal responsibilities and a respect for traditional American values.\u201d The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, another small-government group, gave $100,000 to the DonorsTrust for Mr. Blum\u2019s causes in 2014 and $50,000 in 2012, tax records show.For Mr. Blum\u2019s first suit, the racial gerrymandering case in 1993, he hired a real estate lawyer who agreed to represent him for six months for $7,000, Mr. Blum recalled. But when the case went to the Supreme Court, he knew he needed a Washington lawyer, and found a rising young lawyer willing to take it for nothing at the prestigious Wiley Rein law firm.Since then, Wiley Rein has been practically his house counsel. Fisher and Shelby were argued by Bert Rein, an antitrust and commercial litigator who was a State Department appointee in the Nixon administration. Mr. Rein described Mr. Blum as a client like any other, but one who believed in legal activism, and said his cases were not done pro bono but for a fee, which may be negotiable. \u201cWe are not a \u2018cause\u2019 law firm,\u201d Mr. Rein said. (In some cases Mr. Blum has won, his side has been able to recoup legal fees from the losing side.)The Harvard case is being argued by William Consovoy, a younger partner who recently split away. He clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas, whom he has called \u201cmy hero.\u201dSome civil rights activists think that in suing Harvard, Mr. Blum is picking the wrong fight. Armand Derfner, a civil rights lawyer and constitutional law scholar in residence at the Charleston School of Law in South Carolina, said that admission to the Ivy League was arbitrary for reasons that had little to do with race.Mr. Derfner said he had sensed discrimination against him as a Jew when he applied for jobs at Wall Street firms or socially when he was in college, and could sympathize with the arguments that Asians should not be held back. But he said he doubted that was what was motivating Mr. Blum. \u201cThe lesson he\u2019s spreading is that the problem in our society is that blacks have it too good and whites are getting screwed, and that\u2019s a heck of a lesson in this society,\u201d he said.Harvard denies using quotas. But Robert Iuliano, the university\u2019s general counsel, said that a diverse student body was essential to teaching students how to function in \u201can increasingly interconnected world.\u201dMr. Blum scored a significant victory when a federal judge required Harvard to release six years of admissions data to experts who submitted their analysis, under seal, to the court last month. He is also trying to get similar data from Princeton University released. Ultimately, he expects the judge to open the Harvard data to the public.\u201cThese Ivy League schools will go to the trenches to prevent disclosure of what they are doing,\u201d Mr. Blum said.Kitty Bennett and Jack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}

The new bid is about 60 percent cash, while the last offer was split evenly between cash and stock.Rockwell shares are up nearly 5 percent, though at $197.51 they remain well below the new offer price, suggesting that investors remain wary a deal will get done. (They\u2019re still at highs unseen in Rockwell\u2019s history.) Emerson\u2019s shares have rebounded Thursday, after initially dropping on news of the offer and now flat.Now that Emerson has raised its offer for a third time, there\u2019s a question about which other levers are available to bring Rockwell to the negotiating table.

But Charles and David Koch have been interested in media investments before, having explored a deal for the business now known as Tronc (including the L.A. Times and the Chicago Tribune) four years ago.So it\u2019s possible the Kochs are making a purely economic bet here, and they believe a version of the pitch Time Inc.\u2019s management has been making for years: We\u2019re going to use our declining print business to build a new digital business. (Time Inc.\u2019s digital ad revenues passed $500 million last year \u2014 a number that Time Inc. execs like to compare to BuzzFeed, which did about half of that in the same time frame.)The aim is to reduce the fund\u2019s exposure to a drop in oil and gas prices. These holdings make up 6 percent or about $37 billion of the fund\u2019s benchmark equity index.\u201cWhile the central bank said the view was not based on any prediction of future oil and gas commodity prices or the \u2018sustainability\u2019 of the sector, the move will be closely watched given the fund\u2019s clout in global equity markets.\u201d\u2014 Amie TsangPrevious mishaps have included Yahoo in 2008 overstating the support for its chairman.

{"Headline": "Myths of the 1 Percent: What Puts People at the Top", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDispelling misconceptions about what\u2019s driving income inequality in the U.S. Before looking into some of what\u2019s behind this, let\u2019s address common misconceptions.Unions are thought to redistribute income from owners to workers, but there is no correlation across countries between the change in labor\u2019s share of G.D.P. since 1980 and an increase in the income share of the top 1 percent. Britain saw an increase in the labor share of G.D.P. but also one of the sharpest increases in inequality. The Netherlands saw a large fall in labor\u2019s share but no rise in inequality.Nationalists attribute rising inequality to mass immigration and the supposedly low skills of immigrants.There is no correlation between changing immigration shares since 1990 and rising top-income shares. In fact, the countries that have absorbed the most immigrants \u2014 on a per-capita basis \u2014 have seen overall income inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) fall.An assumption implicit in this argument is that immigrants drag down earnings at the bottom of the distribution, making inequality worse. If this were an important factor, rising inequality should coincide with large gaps in income between foreign-born and native-born adults. It doesn\u2019t.Almost all of the growth in top American earners has come from just three economic sectors: professional services, finance and insurance, and health care, groups that tend to benefit from regulatory barriers that shelter them from competition.The groups that have contributed the most people to the 1 percent since 1980 are: physicians; executives, managers, sales supervisors, and analysts working in the financial sectors; and professional and legal service industry executives, managers, lawyers, consultants and sales representatives.Without changes in these largely domestic services industries \u2014 finance, health care, the law \u2014 the United States would look like Canada or Germany in terms of its top income shares.The United States also stands out in terms of how much money its elite professionals earn relative to the median worker. Workers at the 90th percentile of the income distribution for professionals make 3.5 times the earnings of the typical (median) worker in all occupations in the United States. Only Mexico and Israel, which have very high inequality, compensate professionals so disproportionately. In Switzerland, the Netherlands, Finland and Denmark, the ratio is about 2 to 1.This ratio, the elite professions premium, is very highly correlated with income inequality across countries.Problems cited by these analysts include subsidies for the financial sector\u2019s risk-taking; overprotection of software and pharmaceutical patents; the escalation of land-use controls that drive up rents in desirable metropolitan areas; favoritism toward market incumbents via state occupational licensing regulations (for example, associations representing lawyers, doctors and dentists that block efforts allowing paraprofessionals to provide routine services at a lower price without their supervision).These are just some of the causes contributing to the 1 percent\u2019s high and rising income share. Reforming relevant laws can make markets more efficient and egalitarian, and in contrast with trade, immigration and technology, the political causes of the 1 percent\u2019s rise are directly under the control of citizens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Full Transcript of Trump\u2019s Remarks on Russia", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Hanoi, Vietnam, where he attended a state dinner Saturday evening. While talking to the reporters, he was asked about his private meeting with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin on the sideline of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Danang, Vietnam. Mr. Trump said Mr. Putin was sincere in his denials of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and that questions about Moscow\u2019s meddling were a politically motivated \u201chit job.\u201dFollowing is a transcript of those comments, as prepared by the White House. It has been lightly edited for clarity.Read more coverage \u00bb___________REPORTER: How were your discussions with Vladimir Putin? Did you discuss Syria? And apparently they\u2019ve issued a joint statement that \u2014TRUMP: We issued a joint statement. We\u2019re going to be \u2014 have you seen the statement yet?SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, White House press secretary: It\u2019s going out \u2014 it\u2019s on the way.TRUMP: So I think it\u2019ll go out. You\u2019ll see it in a little while.SANDERS: It may be out, now that you guys \u2014 now that we\u2019re in the air.TRUMP: It\u2019s going to save tremendous numbers of lives. And we did that very quickly. We agreed very quickly.As you know, we saw each other last night just for a picture, and that was the first time. And then today we had a round table with numerous countries. You have a list of the countries, obviously. Right? You have a list.And we spoke intermittently during that round table. We seem to have a very good feeling for each other and a good relationship considering we don\u2019t know each other well. I think it\u2019s a very good relationship.We had two or three very short conversations because of the meeting, the fact that we\u2019re at a meeting. But during those conversations, we talked about Syria and de-conflicting, etc. You know, we have areas where troops are facing \u2014 our troops \u2014 I mean, their troops are facing our troops and there\u2019s nothing in between.And we issued a statement \u2014 a joint statement. It was just approved, and I think people are going to be extremely happy with it and also very impressed with it.REPORTER: Did Russia\u2019s attempts to meddle in U.S. elections come up in the conversation?TRUMP: He said he didn\u2019t meddle. He said he didn\u2019t meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times. But I just asked him again, and he said he absolutely did not meddle in our election. He did not do what they\u2019re saying he did. And he said \u2014REPORTER: Do you believe him?TRUMP: Well, look, I can\u2019t stand there and argue with him. I\u2019d rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you. I\u2019d rather have him \u2014 you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about whether or not \u2014 because that whole thing was set up by the Democrats.I mean, they ought to look at Podesta. They ought to look at all of the things that they\u2019ve done with the phony dossier. Those are the big events. Those are the big events.But Putin said he did not do what they said he did. And, you know, there are those that say, if he did do it, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten caught, all right? Which is a very interesting statement. But we have a \u2014 you know, we have a good feeling toward getting things done.If we had a relationship with Russia, that would be a good thing. In fact, it would be a great thing, not a bad thing. Because he could really help us in North Korea. We have a big problem with North Korea. And China is helping us. And because of the lack of a relationship that we have with Russia because of this artificial thing that\u2019s happening with this Democratic-inspired thing, we could really be helped a lot, tremendously, with Russia having to do with North Korea.And, you know, you\u2019re talking about millions and millions of lives. This isn\u2019t baby stuff. This is the real deal. And if Russia helped us, in addition to China, that problem would go away a lot faster.REPORTER: How did you bring up the issue of election meddling? Did you ask him a question?TRUMP: He just \u2014 every time he sees me, he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t do that.\u201d And I believe \u2014 I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it. But he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t do that.\u201d I think he\u2019s very insulted by it, if you want to know the truth.Don\u2019t forget, all he said is he never did that, he didn\u2019t do that. I think he\u2019s very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country. Because again, if we had a relationship with Russia, North Korea \u2014 which is our single biggest problem right now \u2014 North Korea, it would be helped a lot. I think I\u2019m doing very well with respect to China. They\u2019ve cut off financing; they\u2019ve cut off bank lines; they\u2019ve cut off lots of oil and lots of other things, lots of trade. And it\u2019s having a big impact. But Russia, on the other hand, may be making up the difference. And if they are, that\u2019s not a good thing.So having a relationship with Russia would be a great thing \u2014 not a good thing \u2014 it would be a great thing, especially as it relates to North Korea.And I\u2019ll say this, Hillary had her stupid reset button that she spelled the word wrong, but she doesn\u2019t have what it takes to have that kind of a relationship where you could call or you could do something and they would pull back from North Korea, or they\u2019d pull back from Syria, or maybe pull back from Ukraine. I mean, if we could solve the Ukraine problem \u2014But this is really an artificial barrier that\u2019s put in front of us for solving problems with Russia, and he says that very strongly. He really seems to be insulted by it, and he says he didn\u2019t do it. So \u2014REPORTER: (Inaudible) do you believe him \u2014TRUMP: Excuse me?REPORTER: Even if he (inaudible) one-on-one, do you believe him?TRUMP: I think that he is very, very strong in the fact that he didn\u2019t do it. And then you look, and you look at what\u2019s going on with Podesta, and you look at what\u2019s going on with the server from the D.N.C. and why didn\u2019t the F.B.I. take it, why did they leave it, why did a third party look at the server and not the FBI \u2014 if you look at all of this stuff, and you say, what\u2019s going on here?And then you hear it\u2019s 17 agencies. Well, it\u2019s three. And one is Brennan and one is whatever. I mean, give me a break. They\u2019re political hacks.So you look at it \u2014 I mean, you have Brennan, you have Clapper, and you have Comey. Comey is proven now to be a liar and he\u2019s proven to be a leaker.So you look at that, and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that. Now, you\u2019re not going to get into an argument. You\u2019re going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Race for the Top Job on Wall Street", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the early 1980s, Harvey M. Schwartz was working weekends in the cold room of a kosher butcher shop in New Jersey, shaping beef into hamburger patties.Two hundred miles away in upstate New York, David M. Solomon was a frat brother playing rugby and mulling an entry-level banking position.More than three decades later, the two men are competing for what may be the most coveted job on Wall Street: running Goldman Sachs.The 63-year-old Mr. Blankfein once joked that he planned to die at his desk. But at 11 years, his tenure exceeds those of his recent predecessors, and guessing his replacement has become a popular Wall Street parlor game.Goldman now faces a choice between two distinct characters.Mr. Schwartz, a black belt in karate, spends many Sunday afternoons in the office. Over five hours of interviews for this article, the most revealing moment about his business psychology came when he described how he interviews job candidates: He asks them to try to sell him the Polycom speakerphone that sits on his desk.Aside from a brief stint in the mid-2000s, the two co-presidents have not previously worked together. Now, they\u2019re immersed in an indefinite on-the-job competition against each other \u2014 and they are unlikely to know who won until shortly before Mr. Blankfein\u2019s departure is made public. The board\u2019s succession planning is ongoing, but the details of it are closely guarded, said a person familiar with the process who was not authorized to speak publicly.Current and former Goldman executives say Mr. Blankfein appears unlikely to step aside for at least a year, and he may end up staying for several more. Mr. Blankfein declined to comment.The race to run Goldman comes at a rare moment of vulnerability for the bank.Goldman is still highly profitable. So far this year, it has churned out $8 billion in pretax profit. Its stock price values the company at $90 billion. Making partner there remains a yearned-for rank on Wall Street.But new regulations are clipping profits. Public scrutiny is intense, increasing the likelihood and costs of embarrassing gaffes. Perhaps most important, Goldman\u2019s trading unit, long the engine of its profits, has struggled to adapt to the post-crisis world. In 2009, that business peaked at $33 billion in revenue. This year, the company is on track to make about a third of that.Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Solomon need to come up with ways to compensate for that slide. In April, they presented their proposals to the board: increase lending and financing activities, expand bond trading and do more banking in cities like Atlanta and Seattle. They calculated that those steps, plus a few others, would generate $5 billion in additional revenue over three years.The outcome of those efforts is likely to influence who gets picked to lead their firm\u2019s next generation.Mr. Schwartz was born in Morristown, N.J. His father was a scientist. His mother died of cancer when he was 14. Feeling rudderless after high school, he began working as a trainer at a gym. A Rutgers University alumna pressed him to apply to her alma mater \u2014 and marched him to campus for an interview after he was turned down initially. He got in on the second try.\u201cRutgers was the first place I started to develop my own sense of confidence,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said on a recent walk around the Piscataway campus where he lived for four years, majoring in economics.The six-foot, four-inch Mr. Schwartz held an assortment of odd jobs in college. He was a nightclub bouncer. He ran a quick-service landscaping outfit. He worked at the butcher shop. He learned to expertly sharpen knives.\u201cIf I come over to your house at Thanksgiving and I sharpen your knife, you will definitively know the difference right away,\u201d he joked during an interview in his 41st-floor office.After college, Mr. Schwartz got into finance. His first day on a trading floor was Oct. 19, 1987. The stock market plunged 22 percent on what came to be known as Black Monday. He remembers a colleague crying.\u201cIf you\u2019re around that environment, I don\u2019t know anybody that couldn\u2019t be sensitized to the cyclical nature of the markets,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. It left him with a permanent sense of jitters over how easily capital can be destroyed.A decade later, he was hired at J. Aron, the Goldman commodities unit. One of his first tasks was to establish operations in Australia, where gold miners were eager for ways to protect themselves from market swings by setting up financial hedges. He created elaborate presentation booklets for clients and \u2014 anxious that they might get misplaced \u2014 lugged massive boxes of them onto the plane from New York.\u201cHe\u2019s always been a good shepherd internally in terms of managing risk and balancing that with clients\u2019 interests,\u201d said Kevin Ulrich, who knew Mr. Schwartz as a Goldman colleague before leaving in 2003 to run the hedge fund Anchorage Capital.In 2001, Mr. Blankfein \u2014 then running Goldman\u2019s bonds-trading division \u2014 promoted Mr. Schwartz to be co-head of the unit\u2019s sales team. At the meeting to announce the elevation, Mr. Schwartz was sitting in the audience when he overheard a woman use some blue language to ask her neighbor who on earth he was. He tapped on the back of her chair and whispered, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Harvey.\u201dBy 2013, Mr. Schwartz had ascended to the job of Goldman\u2019s chief financial officer, making him one Mr. Blankfein\u2019s top lieutenants and the bank\u2019s face in the investment community.Mr. Schwartz is cautious and can be tightly scripted. As a general rule, he waits 48 hours to collect his thoughts before addressing someone who has really annoyed him. Some colleagues say he has a tendency to \u201cmark to market\u201d his underlings \u2014 meaning that, in accounting terms, he assesses their value to his objectives and treats them accordingly. That has frustrated some people.Mr. Solomon had a more traditional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for Goldman\u2019s C-suite. He grew up in suburban Hartsdale, N.Y. and spent summers as a camp counselor in New Hampshire. He attended a liberal arts school and joined a fraternity. After graduating, he joined the commercial bank Irving Trust.In the early 1990s, Mr. Solomon joined Bear Stearns, where he helped run the bank\u2019s junk bonds division, working with bankers and salespeople to devise and sell higher-risk bonds. At one point, he helped a Dallas movie theater company, which was struggling to finance its expansion into Mexico, raise money through a complicated bond transaction.Mr. Solomon also built a varied social network, holding an annual holiday party at his Upper West Side home that mixed people from Wall Street with neighbors his wife knew from walking the dog in Central Park.In 1997, Mr. Solomon worked alongside Jon Winkelried, then the co-head of Goldman\u2019s bond division, on a deal to raise money for the Venetian resort in Las Vegas. Mr. Winkelried was impressed with Mr. Solomon\u2019s handling of the deal and offered him a job running Goldman\u2019s leveraged finance team, again raising capital for companies through higher-risk bonds. It was a rare instance of Goldman hiring an outsider and awarding him the rank of partner.Mr. Solomon, 37 at the time, surprised colleagues by defecting from Bear.\u201cI thought he was on the leadership track at Bear,\u201d said Phil Berney, who worked with him there. \u201cBut he saw it\u201d \u2014 Goldman \u2014 \u201cas a great, long-dated franchise to get involved with.\u201d\u201cIt was a step back,\u201d acknowledged Mr. Solomon during a recent interview in his office, four doors down from Mr. Schwartz\u2019s. \u201c I was running a division of a firm and I went and I took a job running a department.\u201d But Bear\u2019s leaders at the time were reluctant to expand globally, and Mr. Solomon worried that without a broader reach, Bear could be left behind. Goldman, he felt, was on firmer footing.For a short time in the mid-2000s, Mr. Solomon was Mr. Schwartz\u2019s boss in a group within Goldman\u2019s investment bank. But Mr. Schwartz soon was promoted to help run another division. After that, they kept largely to separate orbits.Starting in 2006, Mr. Solomon was co-head of Goldman\u2019s investment bank, a job he held for the next decade. Once, he showed up to pitch for the Lululemon Athletica initial public offering wearing a maroon jacket and long sweatpants made by the brand. His colleagues were similarly outfitted. \u201cEveryone on the other side of the table is in suits and ties,\u201d Mr. Solomon recalled. \u201cIt threw people off.\u201d Goldman won a lead role on Lululemon\u2019s I.P.O.On Jan. 18 this year, in one of his last acts as finance chief, Mr. Schwartz announced Goldman\u2019s annual results. Among his duties that day was to brief hundreds of Goldman managing directors, in an auditorium at the company\u2019s headquarters. He delivered a smooth, confident presentation, graciously thanking \u201cthe federation\u201d \u2014 Goldman\u2019s term for its accounting, financial and other back-office employees \u2014 for its hard work.Then things got awkward. Mr. Blankfein \u2014 who was participating by phone from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland \u2014 invited Mr. Solomon to say a few words. But Mr. Solomon was also in Switzerland and had been told ahead of time he would not have to speak. Taken aback, he remarked briefly on his client meetings in the Alps, and then returned the floor to Mr. Blankfein.Some employees speculated that Mr. Blankfein was trying to give equal airtime to the two presidents. Others wondered whether perhaps he had deliberately caught Mr. Solomon off guard.The incident, slight as it was, was talked about for weeks afterward. It was a sign of the intensifying internal gossip about what some referred to as the \u201cHunger Games\u201d-style jockeying for the top job.The two men are now striving to showcase their skills \u2014 whether it comes to wooing clients or setting priorities inside the bank.On Feb. 5, Rob Roy, the chief executive of a data center operator called Switch, said he was attending the Super Bowl with his family when his cellphone rang. It was Mr. Solomon, who was sitting nearby with clients and had heard Mr. Roy was also at the game. He wanted Switch to pick Goldman for the company\u2019s planned initial public stock offering. Mr. Roy and Mr. Solomon, who had not previously met, decided to have a quick introduction in the stadium concourse, Mr. Roy recalled, that turned into a half-hour conversation. Goldman last month won the lucrative role as the lead investment bank on Switch\u2019s I.P.O.Mr. Solomon also leaned on executives in Goldman\u2019s human resources office to hire far more women. Given the nearly even split in society, he argued, there was no reason that Goldman\u2019s ranks should not be equally balanced between men and women. He has taken that message on the road, too.As the presidents crisscross the world, they are never far from each other\u2019s minds \u2014 or inboxes. On a recent trip to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Mr. Schwartz said he had been in frequent touch with Mr. Solomon through voice mail and email. He was heading back to New York the next day.\u201cAnd when I land tomorrow \u2026 when I go to the office, I only have a handful of meetings tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd David is one of them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the chief executive of Switch. As correctly noted elsewhere in the article, he is Rob Roy, not Rob Rob.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Says It Will Ease Debt Burden on Venezuela", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith Venezuela on the edge of default, Russia has thrown it a life preserver.The Russian finance minister, Anton Siluanov, announced on Wednesday that the two countries had agreed to the restructuring of roughly $3 billion in Kremlin loans.The amount is tiny compared with Venezuela\u2019s crushing $120 billion debt, but it may help President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government make hundreds of millions of dollars in payments over the next few weeks to other creditors and help reassure bondholders that a default is not imminent.It has been a scramble for Venezuela to make a $1.2 billion payment on a national oil company bond due last Friday, mostly principal, which had no grace period. Early Wednesday, investors and financial analysts were beginning to fear that Venezuela would not come up with the money it had promised to pay.By midday, overdue transfers to bondholders began. Still, over the last month Venezuela has delayed payment of more than $350 million in interest on various bonds, with grace periods ending over the next few weeks.\u201cClearly the Venezuelans have been looking for relief anywhere they can get it, and at this point Russia is their most viable source of financing,\u201d said Risa Grais-Targow, director for Latin America at Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis firm. \u201cThe Venezuelans have been pushing very hard on the Russians.\u201dOver the past three years, Russia has provided Caracas with $10 billion in financial assistance, and last year Rosneft took a 49.9 percent stake in Citgo, the Venezuelan state oil company\u2019s refining subsidiary in the United States. That represented collateral for a $1.5 billion loan to the parent company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa. Rosneft is negotiating to swap the interest in Citgo for oil fields in Venezuela.Rosneft\u2019s investments have also been focused on Cuba, China, Egypt and Vietnam, and it has been seeking deals around the eastern Mediterranean and Africa, areas where it contends with American interests. Using its oil company as a geopolitical tool has given Russia more running room at a time when Western sanctions weigh heavily on its economy.The terms of the restructuring were not made public on Wednesday, and neither were details of the original loan. Ms. Grais-Targow said the Russian loan might go back several years, to a time when former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who died of cancer in 2013, bought Russian armaments.Since Venezuela customarily pays Russia back with oil, the renegotiation could mean that Venezuela will have more oil to sell on world markets for badly needed cash to make debt payments as well as import food and medicines that are in short supply.Stuart Culverhouse, head of sovereign and fixed-income research at Exotix Capital, an emerging-markets investment bank and broker that trades Venezuelan bonds, described the renegotiation as \u201cRussia trying to be reasonably friendly to prevent something worse.\u201dWashington\u2019s sanctions prohibit Americans from dealing with the man in charge of the renegotiation, Vice President Tareck El Aissam\u00ed, whom American officials have linked to drug trafficking. Sanctions put in place in August also restrict trading of Venezuelan bonds sold by the government in American financial markets.But the call for negotiations also makes an outright Venezuelan declaration of nonpayment of loans more unlikely, so a default would have to be declared by major bondholders themselves.For a default to occur, holders of 25 percent of the value of the bonds would first have to raise the issue with trustees or fiscal agents listed on the bonds. If the government does not satisfy the trustee or agent that it is prepared to make good on the obligations, the creditors can then seek a resolution in court.Mr. Culverhouse said he did not think that bondholders, a diverse group of Venezuelan and international individuals and financial institutions, would move precipitously.\u201cI don\u2019t think a majority would want to accelerate things and declare a default right now,\u201d he said, \u201cThey would want to see what the government\u2019s reaction would be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Sick With Sexism,\u2019 France Must Fight Violence Against Women, Macron Says", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Calling French society \u201csick with sexism,\u201d President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that promoting gender equality and combating violence against women would be top priorities of his government as he announced measures to crack down on sexual crimes and make it easier for victims to press charges.\u201cUnder their blows, under their abuse, a woman dies every three days in France,\u201d Mr. Macron said in a speech at the presidential palace, referring to the number of women killed each year by their current or former partners.\u201cOf this we must all feel responsible,\u201d he said, before asking for a minute of silence for the 123 such women killed in 2016.While feminist groups and associations that work with victims of violence or sexual assault welcomed Mr. Macron\u2019s support, many also worried that he had not committed enough resources to back it up.Of the 225,000 women who were the victims of violence in France last year, less than one in five pressed charges, according to official statistics.But he also said he did not want France to become a country of \u201cdenunciation\u201d where \u201ceach relationship between men and women is suspicious.\u201dSome of the measures announced by Mr. Macron were already expected in a bill to be discussed in Parliament next year.Mr. Macron also said the government would foster awareness of gender equality in schools and in public administrations, and make it easier for victims of violence, harassment or discrimination to press charges. Victims would be allowed file a complaint online or directly at a hospital instead of going to a police station, and to communicate directly with specially trained police officers, he said.Mr. Macron said the powers of France\u2019s television and radio watchdog would be extended to cover video games and online content as way to push back against pornography and content that promotes violence against women.The government will consider \u201clegislative changes\u201d next year to fight cyberbullying, he said, and will sponsor a nationwide awareness campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senators Scramble to Advance Tax Bill That Increasingly Rewards Wealthy", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican tax bill hurtling through Congress is increasingly tilting the United States tax code to benefit wealthy Americans, as party leaders race to shore up wavering lawmakers who are requesting more help for high-earning business owners.On Monday, as Republican lawmakers returned to Washington determined to quickly pass their tax overhaul, senators were in feverish talks to resolve concerns that could bedevil the bill\u2019s passage. With pressure increasing on Republicans to produce a legislative victory, lawmakers are contemplating changes that would exacerbate the tax bill\u2019s divide between the rich and the middle class.Those include efforts to further reward certain high-income business owners who are already receiving a tax break in the Senate bill but who are at the center of a concerted push by conservative lawmakers and trade groups to sweeten those benefits.As Republican leaders pressed for a Senate floor vote this week, there appeared to be little momentum for amendments that would help low-income Americans, which some Republican and many Democratic senators had sought.The Congressional Budget Office said this week that the Senate bill, as written, would hurt workers earning less than $30,000 a year in short order, while delivering benefits to the highest earners throughout the next decade. Those estimates echo other analyses, like that by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which have found the biggest benefits of the bill increasingly flowing to the rich over time. By 2027, the budget office said, Americans earning $75,000 a year and below would, as a group, see their taxes increase, because individual tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025.At the heart of the debate is whether to more favorably treat small businesses and other so-called pass-through entities \u2014 businesses whose profits are distributed to their owners and taxed at rates for individuals. Seventy percent of pass-through income flows to the top 1 percent of American earners, according to research by Owen Zidar, an economist at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business.Senate leaders would need to win over several Republican senators to pass a tax overhaul.Two Republican senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, have said that they will vote against the plan if it does not do more to help the owners of those businesses, possibly by increasing the individual income tax deduction for such owners from the 17.4 percent rate currently in the Senate bill.Mr. Johnson could stall the bill by himself on Tuesday, when it is scheduled for a vote in the Senate Budget Committee. Mr. Johnson sits on that committee, where Republicans have a single-vote majority. On Monday, he said he would vote \u201cno\u201d unless his concerns were addressed.\u201cI need a fix beforehand,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.Earlier in the day, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and the majority whip, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no deal, but there\u2019s been some discussions on how to address Senator Johnson and Senator Daines\u2019s concerns.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be responsive.\u201dAdding to the uncertainty, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee also said on Monday that he could be a \u201cno\u201d vote in the Budget Committee if his concerns about the bill\u2019s effect on the deficit were not adequately addressed.Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who leads the Senate Finance Committee, said that there was a strong desire to get a bill passed by Friday and that additional changes would most likely be made on the Senate floor. Despite speculation that the House will face pressure to quickly vote upon whatever passes in the Senate, Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said he \u201cfully expects\u201d that there would be a conference to bridge differences between the House and Senate plans.It\u2019s virtually impossible to fully understand, let alone keep up with, the flood of proposals, amendments and analyses that continue to pour out. Here are some of the big-picture ideas to keep in mind as this political sausage is being made.The pass-through fight is the first skirmish in what lawmakers and lobbyists expect will be a frenzied week, which Republican leaders hope will produce the first major legislative victory of the Trump-era for their party.The week is expected to be punctuated by behind-the-scenes arm twisting and deal making as party leaders work to allay senators\u2019 worries without exceeding their self-imposed $1.5 trillion budget for tax cuts. At least a half-dozen senators have raised concerns about the bill, including its potential to add to the federal deficit and a provision that would eliminate the Affordable Care Act requirement that most Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty.Many of those senators are in discussions with party leaders over how to tweak the bill to address their concerns. James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said on Monday that he was in talks over a proposal meant to ensure the tax plan did not balloon the deficit. Mr. Lankford said the Senate was discussing inserting a provision that would lead to tax increases \u2014 as yet unspecified \u2014 after a period of years if federal revenues fell short of lawmakers\u2019 projections.\u201cTo me,\u201d Mr. Lankford said, \u201cthe big issue is how are we dealing with debt and deficit, do we have realistic numbers, and is there a backstop in the process just in case we don\u2019t?\u201dMr. Corker and Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has also expressed concerns about the bill\u2019s costs, said on Monday that they were similarly interested in some type of trigger or backstop.Some other senators\u2019 concerns appear less likely to be addressed. Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, for example, appear to be making little progress in persuading party leaders to expand access to the child tax credit for low-income families, by allowing the credit to be refundable against payroll tax liability. Such a move would allow working parents who do not currently face income tax liability to still benefit from the expanded credit envisioned in the bill.On Monday, several Republicans from the Senate Finance Committee, including Mr. Hatch, emerged from a lunch with President Trump at the White House saying that they were confident they would have the necessary votes to pass the package this week and would be able to resolve differences with the House version so that the bill could be signed into law in short order.\u201cWe\u2019re generally able to get together and solve these problems,\u201d Mr. Hatch said of the House and Senate.White House officials privately said that they hoped the two chambers could resolve their differences privately and informally to avoid a potentially lengthy and divisive formal conference that typically is needed to complete major legislation.Asked whether the legislation could be completed by Christmas, Mr. Hatch said, \u201cI hope so.\u201dHe added that Democrats should \u201cget off their duffs\u201d and support the plan. Mr. Trump, for his part, said later in the day that he was not interested in getting Democratic support.\u201cIf we win, we\u2019ll get some Democratic senators joining us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not so interested in that. We\u2019re really interested just in getting it passed.\u201dMr. Trump is expected to go to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to have lunch with Republican senators before meeting with the top congressional leaders from both parties in the afternoon.Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Peter Baker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Yemen Crumbles, One Town Is an Island of Relative Calm", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarib JournalMARIB, Yemen \u2014 As much of Yemen slides toward famine, residents of this dusty desert town can now buy food many locals had never tasted before: pizza, hamburgers and ice cream.While the country is divided between competing factions, the government of Marib Province has used oil revenues and tribal politics to lessen the blows of war, providing a level of security and services lacking elsewhere. Its relative stability has attracted Yemenis fleeing more violent areas, some of whom have in turn brought money to buy property and start businesses.\u201cIt is a success in exceptional circumstances,\u201d said Abdul-Razaq Naqib, a production supervisor for Yemen\u2019s Safer oil company. \u201cLike digging through rock with your fingers,\u201d he said, using a Yemeni saying for doing the impossible.During a recent four-day trip to Marib with a group of Western journalists and researchers, I saw a town struggling for a sense of normalcy \u2014 and even progress \u2014 despite the collapsed country around it.\u201cWe can\u2019t stop the war in Yemen right now, but at least we can cause more conversation about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to bring the world to Yemen and bring Yemen to the world.\u201dMarib\u2019s unlikely success is partly a symptom of the near complete shattering of the Yemeni state, which has left regions to fend for themselves in providing life\u2019s basics for their people.But the ingredients that make it work \u2014 warm ties with Saudi Arabia, oil and gas reserves, and a forward-looking governor \u2014 make it unlikely to be easily replicated elsewhere. And despite the progress here, security threats and poverty remain.Central to Marib\u2019s rise has been the provincial governor, Sultan Al-Aradah, our host, who provided the armed convoy that retrieved us from the airport, guarded our hotel and drove us around.He clearly wanted to show off his town\u2019s progress while elevating his political profile. It worked. After the local news media reported on our visit, Yemen\u2019s president and prime minister both called to congratulate him.Marib\u2019s growth has surprised locals.Until a few years ago, the town had only a few paved roads, and clashes between tribes raged often. The Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda is active in the province, and American drone strikes often kill people thought to be militants.\u201cIt was Marib\u2019s fate to confront it,\u201d Mr. Aradah said of the rebel attack. \u201cWe tried to face the danger to us with one hand and to build with the other hand.\u201dSince then, as talks aimed at ending the war have stalled, Mr. Aradah has kept his focus local.He has a few advantages. Marib Province produces much of Yemen\u2019s oil and gas, and Mr. Aradah\u2019s administration now collects 20 percent of the proceeds, allowing it to pay salaries and finance infrastructure projects.New roads cross the city, and a soccer stadium is rising downtown that will have turf imported from Germany, local officials said. Mr. Aradah is planning an international airport.Saudi Arabia has long maintained ties with Marib tribal leaders, including Mr. Aradah, and leads a coalition that is bombing the Houthis and has a base in Marib.The town\u2019s relative security has attracted Yemenis displaced by the war, and its population has swelled. Precise statistics are hard to come by, but the United Nations says that 73,000 people who fled other parts of the country have settled in Marib Province, in addition to its original population of 340,000. Local officials say the number of displaced is much higher.While security concerns prevented us from roaming freely, during tours organized by the governor\u2019s office we saw displaced people crowded into unfinished buildings, covering their windows with plastic and cardboard.Local historic sites associated with the legendary Queen of Sheba are neglected and strewn with trash. Violence has kept tourists away for years, and they are unlikely to return soon.At a cultural night in a large tent near the governor\u2019s office, a band played, dancers leapt in the sand and a gray-haired man sang mournfully, \u201cWhoever loses gold can find it in a jewelry shop, but whoever loses the homeland land will not find it anywhere.\u201dOther sites brimmed with optimism.\u201cMarib has become a refuge for all Yemenis,\u201d said Mohammed Abdul-Khaliq, a media student at the town\u2019s public university who had fled to Marib after the Houthis took over his hometown.Turmoil had shuttered the university, administrators said, but it reopened last year with 2,700 students. Now it has more than 5,000, and tin classrooms have been erected to handle the overflow.Students who had fled from elsewhere said they mixed well with locals. I met two young women in black abayas and face veils who were studying physics. One, Rasmiya Matkour, said her family had fled Sana out of fear that they would die in Saudi airstrikes meant for the Houthis.Her friend, Sheema Mohsin, a Marib native, said she had been amazed at how the town had changed, with new restaurants, better roads and a park for children.But the war was never far away. On the day of our hospital visit, a rocket believed to have been fired by the Houthis landed in an open area and an explosion of unknown origin killed a young boy. On our first night, a strike that locals assumed to be from an American drone killed four people believed to be Qaeda militants.On the edge of town, a \u201cmartyrs\u2019 cemetery\u201d of sandy graves and simple headstones stretched nearly to the horizon. It did not exist a few years ago, but now holds the remains of hundreds of men, women and children.At Marib\u2019s general hospital, most of the patients were war victims.In a workshop, technicians crafted artificial limbs for patients wounded by land mines, and the hospital had taken in so many wounded fighters that young men packed its pediatric ward.Six lay on beds in one room. One was covered in bandages and moaning; his car had been blown up as he entered a military base, nurses said. The next had a broken arm and bullet holes in his shoulder. Yet another had been shot through the stomach by a sniper.Next door were six more men, including Khalil al-Kual, 20, a soldier who had stepped on a land mine, losing his left foot and peppering his other limbs with shrapnel.\u201cI\u2019ll get a fake limb and go back to the front,\u201d he said.When asked how the war would end, he replied: \u201cThe only solution is with God.\u201dMr. Aradah, the governor, said he had worked to increase the rule of law, but problems persist.A university student, Somaya Sanea, said that her husband, Mohsin al-Awadi, had been dragged from his cellphone shop by security forces after a Facebook post in his name criticized local political figures. His wife and their infant son have not seen him since.\u201cEven if someone is a criminal, they can\u2019t put him away and not give his family any news,\u201d she said.Khalid Baglan, the head of a local youth organization, said security forces had attacked him and his colleagues in October when they protested the appointment of a new security chief for the province.One of his friends died from a gunshot wound, and three are still detained, he said.Sadam al-Adwar, a local human rights activist, said that such issues appeared to be less common than in other parts of Yemen, but that he knew of more than 10 people who had been detained for apparent political reasons.\u201cPolitical cases never ever go to the court,\u201d he said.Still, the town\u2019s rise has brought other natives home, and highlighted the potential for development in Yemen when basic security can be provided.Mohammed Zubaiyen, the business manager of large family enterprise with interests across the Persian Gulf, said the family had moved its businesses out of Yemen in 2011 as turmoil spread.Now, they\u2019re back, launching an $8 million venture to build a new, modern district mixing residential and commercial properties, he said.Other projects have picked up, too, like the failed mall his family built in 2006. After sitting largely vacant for years, its 104 shops are full, he said, and the family is considering building more.\u201cThere is a future for malls in Marib,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Plans to End Obamacare Mandate in Revised Tax Proposal", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans have decided to include the repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that most people have health insurance into the sprawling tax rewrite, merging the fight over health care with the high-stakes effort to cut taxes.They also have made a calculated gamble to help speed their bill to passage on a party-line vote: Republicans revealed late Tuesday they would set all of their tax cuts for individuals to expire at the end of 2025, to comply with a procedural requirement. Their deep cut in the corporate tax rate would remain permanent.Both the expiration decision and the move to tuck the repeal of the so-called individual mandate into the tax overhaul are attempts by Republicans to solve two problems: math and politics. Repealing the mandate, a longstanding Republican goal, would save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. That would free up money that is earmarked to expand middle-class tax cuts.Setting individual provisions to expire helps hold down the overall cost of the bill, which can add no more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years and cannot add to deficits after 10 years. Mandate repeal could also help secure the votes of the most conservative senators, enabling lawmakers to pass the bill along party lines.The decision to set individual provisions to expire at the end of 2025 could set up a potential \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d situation then, akin to the one President Barack Obama and Congress faced at the end of 2012. Those breaks include tax-rate reductions, the near-doubling of the standard deduction and a provision to reduce the number of Americans who would have to pay the estate tax. Republicans made those changes to stay within Senate rules that allow them to pass the bill on a party-line vote; as promised, they did not set expiration dates on the bill\u2019s corporate rate cut.If the bill were to become law, and Congress did not seek to make those provisions permanent, tax bills would rise for vast parts of the country in 2026.The mandate repeal would save more than $300 billion over a decade but result in 13 million fewer Americans being covered by health insurance by the end of that period, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Republicans said on Tuesday that they would use the savings \u2014 which stem from reduced government spending to subsidize health coverage \u2014 to pay for an expansion of the middle-class tax cuts that lawmakers had proposed.The dozens of changes in the legislation would add more than $1.4 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years.Middle-class measures in the revised tax plan released late Tuesday include expanding the child tax credit to $2,000 a child, up from $1,650 in the original version of the Senate plan, and three reductions in marginal tax rates. One rate would fall to 22 percent from 22.5 percent; another to 24 percent from 25 percent; and another to 32 percent from 32.5 percent.On the House side, members of the Rules Committee met Tuesday evening, one day earlier than scheduled, to pave the way for a floor vote on Thursday.Democrats said the mandate repeal would underwrite tax cuts for the rich at the expense of people who buy insurance on the individual market.\u201cThe people this is going to hit are middle-class people that ostensibly this whole bill was supposed to be about helping,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri and a member of the Finance Committee.Average health insurance premiums in the individual market would increase by about 10 percent, but insurance markets would remain stable in almost all parts of the country, the budget office found.President Trump has urged his fellow Republicans to repeal the mandate in their tax bill, and in recent days, the idea has gained steam in the Senate Republican conference as lawmakers try to come up with a plan that can receive at least 50 votes.\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader.\u201cThis is turning a tax bill into a health care bill, with our colleagues getting an hour\u2019s worth of notice,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee.In a letter on Tuesday, groups representing doctors, hospitals and insurers urged congressional leaders to keep the individual mandate in place. The groups, which included the American Medical Association and America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, wrote that \u201celiminating the individual mandate by itself likely will result in a significant increase in premiums, which would in turn substantially increase the number of uninsured Americans.\u201dOn Tuesday, Republicans were laser-focused on speeding ahead with the tax rewrite and showed no desire to slow down that effort.House Republican leaders plan to hold a vote on their bill on Thursday and expressed confidence that it would pass the House. Senate Republicans, who unveiled their tax proposal last week, are planning to vote on their own version the week after Thanksgiving.On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analysts raised their odds of a tax package being signed into law to 80 percent, from 65 percent.\u201cWe feel very good where we are,\u201d said Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker and Republican of Wisconsin.Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Republican leadership who also serves on the Finance Committee, said he was confident that the tax plan, with the mandate repeal as part of it, could pass the Senate.But not all senators were as sanguine about its passage and Republicans will need to carefully calibrate votes, given that they hold a narrow 52-seat majority in the Senate.\u201cI personally think that it complicates tax reform,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.But Ms. Murray rejected any suggestion that the mandate repeal could be paired with her legislation.\u201cThat is the exact opposite of what we should be doing,\u201d she said. \u201cAmericans have stood up and spoken loudly for the last year saying they do not want the markets destabilized, and their provision in the tax bill that they are talking about will really destabilize the marketplaces.\u201dLobbyists seeking changes to the bill were mostly preparing to shift their efforts to the Senate.The National Association of Realtors flew in 60 of its members from around the country to raise concerns with House members over several provisions in the House bill that the group says will hurt home buyers and erode incentives for homeownership.The mood they found in their meetings, said Jamie Gregory, the group\u2019s deputy chief lobbyist, was \u201cresignation that this bill is going to pass the House.\u201d But, he added: \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go. There\u2019s still the Senate, there\u2019s still a conference committee, there\u2019s still a chance to make this better.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Paradise Papers Hacking and the Consequences of Privacy", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLast month, the international law firm Appleby announced it had been the victim of a hacking and that information on its clients was in the hands of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the news gathering organization that broke the story of the Panama Papers in April 2016.On Sunday, material from that hacking became public. The Paradise Papers exposed the hidden financial dealings of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Queen Elizabeth and the athletic apparel company Nike, among many others. As revelations about tax-dodging airplane purchases and secret Russian ownership in tech companies came to light, Appleby declared that it takes its clients\u2019 confidentiality seriously and billed itself as \u201cnot the subject of a leak but of a serious criminal act.\u201dIn an age in which personal consumer data is routinely plundered for profit, it\u2019s smart public relations for law firms like Appleby and the tax havens in which their clients hide their assets to present themselves as victims of a global crime epidemic. There is also genuine belief operating here. J\u00fcrgen Mossack and Ram\u00f3n Fonseca, the founders of the law firm whose hacked files formed the heart of the Panama Papers, described their work as safeguarding their clients\u2019 fundamental right to privacy in their financial affairs. Mr. Mossack and Mr. Fonseca insisted that when their customers asked them to set up hundreds of thousands of anonymous companies, trusts and foundations, it too was in the interest of privacy.However, in the world of offshore finance, privacy long ago became a corrosive secrecy.Appleby is a major player in a global offshore industry that helps multinational corporations and the mega-wealthy legally move money beyond the reach of the taxman through a network of tax havens and secret financial centers. As a lawyer at Mossack Fonseca candidly wrote in a confidential internal memorandum, \u201c95 percent of our work\u201d is \u201cselling vehicles to avoid paying taxes.\u201dThe amounts involved are staggering. An estimated 8 percent of household financial wealth is held offshore, representing a loss in annual global tax revenue of about $190 billion. But this pales in comparison to the tax avoidance and tax evasion by the large multinational companies that use this system. All told, more than $7.6 trillion may well be hidden in tax havens around the world, according to Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the issue.In Congress, Republicans promote lower tax rates for American corporations even as companies employ the offshore system to pay little tax on billions of dollars in profit. This uncomfortable reality is not the focus of the tax debate in part because firms like Appleby help keep these activities secret. The public is simply unaware.Meanwhile, there is the torrent of illegal cash that washes through tax havens and secret bank accounts \u2014 cash that is often put to illicit use, from bribing public officials to arms trafficking. The research and advocacy organization Global Financial Integrity has estimated that transnational criminal activities account for $1.6 trillion to $2.2 trillion annually. And laundered money represents 2 percent to 5 percent of global G.D.P., according to a recent report by the European Parliament.The right of privacy keeps this underground river of money secret, but its existence has real-world consequences. Tax avoidance robs governments of funds to pay for education, health care and infrastructure. Prices for homes in New York, Miami, Los Angeles, London and other cities have spiraled beyond the reach of most residents because the global elite, often hiding behind anonymous companies, parks cash in them. And the corruption it enables is a major factor in the persistence of dire poverty in resource-rich regions like Africa.Last week, the special counsel Robert Mueller indicted Paul Manafort, the former chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, on money laundering charges. The indictment charges that Mr. Manafort used offshore Cypriot companies and overseas bank accounts to disguise payments from a foreign government and bring the money into the United States. Even after scrutiny by one of the most high-powered teams of prosecutors and investigators ever assembled, it\u2019s still not clear how many millions of dollars passed through these various channels. \u201cManafort\u2019s financial holdings are substantial, if difficult to quantify precisely because of his varying representations,\u201d Mr. Mueller stated in one legal filing.With the offshore world so expansive and so in need of transparency, it often falls to journalists and those with access to leaked data to shine light on these secret dealings. Privacy is not an absolute right when the public interest is at stake. And so, journalists must face a difficult question before seeking to publish information that comes from hackers or other unauthorized leaks: Does this information directly affect the well-being of society?When it comes to the secrecy world, which caters to the moneyed elite and the politically powerful, the answer is often yes. Still, the Mossack Fonseca documents in the Panama Papers were full of confidential information about people who broke no laws. The exposure of this information did not meet a public interest test. Despite complaints by WikiLeaks and other advocacy groups that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists should have posted all the Panama Papers material online, the organization never seriously contemplated such a move.What it has done instead is create the world\u2019s most extensive online database of offshore company names, directors and shareholders. This database is about to grow significantly thanks to the Paradise Papers revelations, which include information from 19 corporate registries held by tax havens. The consortium has created a resource that shines a light on shadowy activities that undermine the rule of law and the norms of public responsibility. In this way, a flag has been planted on the boundary between privacy and secrecy.Jake Bernstein, a senior reporter for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in the Panama Papers investigation, is the author of \u201cSecrecy World: Inside the Panama Papers Investigation of Illicit Money Networks and the Global Elite.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the \u2018Resistance\u2019 Helped Democrats Dominate Virginia", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "FeatureFor campaign managers like Kathryn Sorenson, much of their job was simply channeling the enormous wave of energy that came their way.Supported byEven if she hadn\u2019t broken her neck, she most likely couldn\u2019t have taken even a few hours off work to attend the march: She was the manager, and sole employee, of the two-week-old David Reid for Delegate campaign. Sorenson met Reid on New Year\u2019s Day for a mutual interview; Reid, a well-kept, goateed father of two in his mid-50s, was a latecomer to politics, and was relieved when Sorenson agreed to lead his campaign for the House of Delegates, the 100-member lower chamber of Virginia\u2019s legislature. In her six years out of college, Sorenson had worked continuously on campaigns, all but one of them in Northern Virginia, and despite her youth, she exhibited the grim, sardonic cheer of the veteran operative.Sorenson agreed to work with a novice like Reid because he seemed committed to real issues, and he made a sincere first impression. Also, she liked his odds. Virginia\u2019s 32nd house district is part of Loudoun County, one of the fastest growing counties in the country and, by median income, the wealthiest. Verdant, indistinguishable subdivisions are laid out in self-contained loops between windowed blocks of strip mall and windowless blocks of data center. There are overpasses to nowhere; there are construction sites that look like Caterpillar sales lots as well as actual Caterpillar sales lots. The county and its schools are around 30 percent nonwhite, with a large immigrant population. (Sorenson\u2019s favorite local lunch spot is an Afghan kebab joint.) The 32nd went for Hillary Clinton by 19 points. There was, Sorenson quickly got into the habit of saying, \u201cabsolutely no reason this district has a Republican delegate.\u201dThey had come, she realized, on behalf of what she began to call \u201cthe pop-up groups.\u201d She went to as many of their meetings as she could and found that many of their members were largely unacquainted with politics, especially on the local level. Some of them weren\u2019t even county residents; they were from McLean, and Arlington, and D.C., and even Maryland. Though a majority of these meetings might have been better described as meetings about meetings, she nevertheless admired all these new faces and the vitality they were prepared to bring to what were ordinarily considered marginal down-ballot races.What Sorenson needed from these inchoate volunteer armies, however, was not a collective expression of outrage; it was reliable support for campaign practicalities like door-knocking and phone-banking, tasks that lacked the glamour and solidarity of marches and protests. Even those who could readily speak about state and local issues \u2014 how the Republicans in the House of Delegates had refused the Medicaid expansion and passed a sheaf of anti-abortion bills; how Loudoun County was the only district in Northern Virginia without full-day kindergarten; how somebody needed to put a stoplight at Waxpool and Demott, where Sorenson was almost killed \u2014 were rarely acquainted with the proper channels for action. They would talk about calling their representative, and Sorenson would say, \u201cThat\u2019s not a congressional thing, that\u2019s a state thing!\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s not a state thing, that\u2019s a supervisor thing! Call your supervisor!\u201d Sorenson showed them how to find out who their supervisors were. They wanted to write letters to Terry McAuliffe, the governor, about bathroom discrimination. She said: \u201cDon\u2019t write letters to Terry! The bathroom bill is dead, don\u2019t worry. It died in subcommittee, and even if it hadn\u2019t, Terry had already promised to veto it, so pick a better battle!\u201dTo get Reid on the ballot, Sorenson explained, the campaign needed to collect 125 signatures by March. The pop-up groups were happy to help, especially because Sorenson had a pleasant, easygoing appeal, not to mention a broken neck. Within a few weeks, she was given almost 600 names. She couldn\u2019t quite account for how it was done; these groups didn\u2019t have leadership, exactly, or if they did, they had large \u201csteering committees\u201d \u2014 and they could be touchy if you used the wrong word or gave one individual too much credit \u2014 but they used Facebook and they contacted friends of friends and somehow they got the signatures they needed. And not only that. Representatives from some groups got the required signatures, and then representatives from some other groups materialized to vet those signatures and remove inadvertent out-of-district signatories, and then still other representatives from different or maybe the same groups suggested they might help Sorenson by formatting all of that petition data so they could merge the relevant information with their master voter file. As long as Sorenson was explicit about what she needed, it all seemed to just ... happen.A majority of the pop-up groups were experiments in decentralized organizing, so individual chapters were free to expend their energy where and how they pleased. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia \u2014 and in particular to its 32nd district. Reid\u2019s district had no primary, for one thing, and seemed acutely winnable. It also had Sorenson. She was not only competent; she was, at least outwardly, calm. She also reached out to each group on its own terms, even if that effort alone absorbed three or four hours of each day. And she didn\u2019t want to seem exploitative, so she refused on principle to blast the groups\u2019 lists with what she called \u201chair-on-fire send-$5-now-or-the-world-will-end emails.\u201dThough in theory these groups had diverse goals, the impression they made on Sorenson was one of a great, reverberant longing. \u201cThere\u2019s just this huge energy,\u201d Sorenson told me, \u201cwith people saying, \u2018We want to do something right now, we want to effect change in this election.\u2019\u2009\u201d They were hard to keep track of: who was with which group, what each one cared about, which groups were subgroups or affinity groups of other groups, which had national umbrella organizations and which didn\u2019t, which terms of art groups preferred to describe their particular variety of leaderlessness. There were chapters and huddles and pods, and they used Google Forms or Google Docs or Eventbrites or Meetups. She found herself scrolling through endless Facebook commentaries in search of group moderators or other sources of provisional authority.She began to build her own Google Doc as a central storehouse for all the fugitive information. This color-coded document included but was not limited to, in no particular order, the following groups: 31st Street Swing Left; Code Blue; Indivisible Del Ray; Indivisible VA Assembly 42; Network NoVA; NOVANation Coalition; Sister District DC; Sister District Maryland; Swing Left; Together We Will NoVA; Vienna Neighbors United; VOTE MOB VA; WofA (We of Action); ACT Empowered; We ARE the People Who Stand Up; Loudoun 4 Women\u2019s March on Washington; Hunter Mill Huddle; Arlington Huddle Action Network; Neighbors for a Blue Virginia; Ward 3 Democrats; the Resurgent Left; Turn It Blue DC (formerly Swing Left NE DC); Dining for Democracy; #Citizen. Sorenson got a kick out of the names the groups had given themselves. She loved one called the Huddlery.Sorenson\u2019s list included the names of the principals, to which she often felt obligated to append the qualification \u201c(co-leader?)\u201d or \u201c(steering committee member?).\u201d She documented their purpose, insofar as she could divine it; her perception of their viability (\u201call talk no plans\u201d); and their willingness to help the Reid campaign to, as her own hashtag put it, #flip32blue. Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way. Some, like Flippable, had former campaign people on staff; they just needed to hear the numbers and they\u2019d mail a check. Others, like the West L.A. Democratic Club, asked her questions for an hour before saying no. Some had clear purity tests \u2014 \u201cWill you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?\u201d \u201cWere you endorsed by Senator Sanders?\u201d \u2014 and Sorenson\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t always check all the boxes. Others were concerned that she didn\u2019t need the help badly enough.Sorenson did her best to put her candidate and their campaign up for adoption in a way that made their specific requirements clear. It was going to be expensive, for one thing. They had to raise at least $400,000, or $500,000 if she wanted her \u201cCadillac plan.\u201d The map of Loudoun County is a Mandelbrot set of nested subdivisions, and three of her precincts \u2014 the Villas, Lansdowne Woods and the Ashby Ponds retirement community \u2014 are gated and thus \u201cunknockable,\u201d which meant the campaign would have to double down on phone banking. This would require a lot of coordination. Running against a seven-year incumbent, Reid also faced a huge deficit in name recognition, which meant that early preparatory canvassing was just as important as a late turnout effort.Money and time would always be the hardest asks, but while Sorenson was still neck-braced and understaffed, there were plenty of basic start-up tasks to complete. One outfit offered to make the campaign an easily updatable website. Another sent a member to take photographs, which saved the campaign $700. Sorenson offhandedly mentioned that it would be nice to have a spreadsheet itemizing all of Tag Greason\u2019s votes in his seven years in the House of Delegates \u2014 bill number, how he voted, why it matters. She had it within hours. Yet another organization delivered print-at-home postcards that recalled classic Americana, marked with parks and schools and polling places; she wanted people to keep in mind that the 32nd district was an actual place. She loved the postcards, even if she had to send repeated reminders about which disclosures were necessary to make them compliant with campaign-finance law.It wasn\u2019t lost on her that some of the work being done was redundant, and that some of her interactions required more effort than they ultimately returned, but Sorenson understood that the new spirits were fragile. She tried to remind herself that each group brought its own perspective or talent, even as her attempt to outline their special characteristics revealed a litany of special needs. One group was part of a Jewish organization and thus couldn\u2019t canvass on Saturdays. Another one wanted to know how to get over to Loudoun without paying tolls, and many of its members were older and needed printed directions or car pools. But Sorenson\u2019s willingness to keep track of and accommodate all these preferences gave her word-of-mouth fame. No research trial \u2014 volunteer-coordination software, fund-raising by text message \u2014 was too small or bug-ridden for her to disdain, and she joked that she was first in every line to serve as a guinea pig.In June, Shaun Daniels, then an executive director of an influential PAC called Win Virginia, told me, \u201cNo one anywhere is working with more outside groups than Kathryn.\u201d Democratic politics had entered a new era of experimentation, he said, and \u201cthis here is ground zero.\u201dThe other salient election was the recent runoff between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. Sorenson herself was not disposed to draw any big lessons from Ossoff\u2019s defeat, which she was by nature unable to regard as a leading indicator on the president, or the Democratic Party, or the role of outside patrons. It seemed to her that the campaign was waged about as well as it could have been in a district that was close to impossible for a Democrat to win. For many of her volunteers, however, the loss felt like a dispiriting prelude to what was supposed to be a stirring campaign kickoff.Early in the morning, a crowd of campaign staff members, longstanding volunteers and outside irregulars milled around Reid\u2019s home in anticipation of their canvassing shifts. The family\u2019s two shiba inus were underfoot, the coffee table was decorated with back issues of astronomy and archaeology magazines and the whole place smelled faintly but persistently of maple syrup. There were cars from Massachusetts and Missouri, and Reid joked more than once about how he kept meaning to give out an award for the person who traveled the farthest to be there. The volunteers were mostly women, and mostly middle-aged, and had come outfitted for day hikes of moderate exertion. Whenever one of them was asked which group, if any, she had come with, there was a perceptible pause as she thought about the profusion of mailers in her inbox and posts in her Facebook feed.Those there for the first time were nervous about how they would be greeted. A woman from Vienna, Va., named Francesca, in capri-length cargo pants, sturdy boots and a beaded necklace, raised her hand. She had come on behalf of half a dozen groups. \u201cAm I going to look like a carpetbagger, or should I say that I care so much that I came here from elsewhere?\u201dReid looked to Sorenson before responding. \u201cNobody will ask you because you look like the district \u2014 it\u2019s pretty diverse here. We joke that we give an award for the person who came the furthest. All of this, here, it\u2019s really starting to make a difference.\u201d The volunteers were shuffled through a brief orientation, which was longer on Reid\u2019s biography \u2014 a foster child who was the first in his family to go to college; a local businessman who sent his daughters to the public schools; a retired Navy Reserve intelligence officer who gave 23 years of service to his country \u2014 than it was on his positions. But the point of the summer canvass was deliberately introductory.Francesca, the woman from Vienna, cleared a space for me in her cluttered minivan. She\u2019d worked on clean-energy policy, she told me en route, but her entire department was recently eliminated. We passed a new data center across from a data center under construction. She delivered an impassioned monologue as she tried to pay attention to the GPS; she had an air of spiky distraction, as if stopping to scowl at news alerts while watching a TV show. \u201cNow the Klan is out in Charlottesville when they take down the Confederate monuments. Just the other day I went to the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center for the first time in my life. It\u2019s intersectionality. If affluent people like me aren\u2019t caring about Black Lives Matter, well \u2014 it kind of opened my eyes. We can\u2019t ever not be engaged again. It\u2019s like the Founding Fathers\u2019 idea of the yeoman government. My progressive friends, they\u2019re on Facebook but they\u2019re not out canvassing and phone-banking. There\u2019s nothing else going on in \u201917, and there\u2019s all this pent-up energy.\u201dFrancesca said she had gone to the Women\u2019s Summit the previous morning and left exhilarated, but what she took away from the conference wasn\u2019t wholly clear. Each delegate emphasized the importance of gerrymandering, and health care, and school funding, and rural broadband, and the state of the roads. If the national Democratic Party really was in crisis, torn between cultural politics and pocketbook issues, it certainly wasn\u2019t visible at the summit. The biggest applause line of the day came from Danica Roem, a transgender former journalist and \u201cfreshman member of the Democratic Party\u201d who won a surprise victory in a four-way primary in District 13, to the south. \u201cMy opponent,\u201d she said with national-stage charisma, \u201ccares more about where I go to the bathroom than how you get to work!\u201d Francesca, however, seemed to have little interest in low-stakes issues like the office vacancies on Manassas Drive. \u201cWe\u2019re literally fighting for our democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u2019\u2009\u201dWe got out to canvass in a subdivision of modest flagpoled homes on branching cul-de-sacs. Francesca traipsed over people\u2019s lawns and rapped hard on doors. The hit rate with canvassing is always low, and over two hours on a hot and cloudless Sunday, we encountered only half a dozen families at home.In the few conversations Francesca did have, she was invariably friendly and polite, but her pitch about Reid was mostly that he was a great guy; every once in a while she remembered to say that he was in favor of full-day kindergarten districtwide or distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. In her one extended interaction, a young mother began by saying that her family cared above all about full-day kindergarten. She had only ever voted in presidential elections, she admitted, but then managed, over the course of five minutes, to convince herself that she was wrong to do so.\u201cI don\u2019t vote in the local but I guess I really need to now,\u201d she said.\u201cWell, I was never out canvassing before, either!\u201d Francesca said.Some volunteers I accompanied were more careful to stay off lawns, or more fluent in the local issues, or had greater experience with the mechanics of political campaigns; some remembered that a \u201c1\u201d on the voter-information sheet meant most likely to vote for David Reid, while others were sure that great enthusiasm was recorded with a \u201c5.\u201d On the record, they were always positive about their huddles and steering committees, even if off the record they wondered whether the welter of organizations meant duplicative or otherwise-inefficient resource allocation. No one, however, seemed frustrated by the fact that they reached only a handful of voters, or discouraged from making a return trip.By the end of the weekend, more than 40 volunteers had knocked on more than 2,500 doors. Sorenson rarely allowed herself to be thrilled by anything, but she conceded some satisfaction that these were patently terrific results. This wasn\u2019t to say that everything had gone smoothly. When canvassing was over, Sorenson checked the campaign\u2019s email account to find a restrained but irate message from a community member, upset that his home\u2019s \u201cno soliciting\u201d sign was ignored. The volunteer stood and argued about the First Amendment. The voter leaned Republican, he continued, but had always voted on both sides of the aisle, and from what he knew about David Reid, he was interested. This encounter, however, had cost them his vote.This didn\u2019t sound to Sorenson like one of her own people. She looked up the planned itineraries of one of the outside groups \u2014 an organization dedicated to voter-suppression issues \u2014 and found that it must have been someone from its camp. Sorenson wasn\u2019t sure there was much she could do. \u201cThey have a different list, and a different script, and different priorities. We tell our people in training not to get into constitutional battles, but each group does its own thing.\u201dThe major development was an unexpected shift in the dynamics at the top of the ticket. The governor and the state\u2019s two senators were Democrats; the pipe dream for November 2017 was to bring the State Legislature into line. In August, however, the Republican gubernatorial candidate \u2014 a former lobbyist, R.N.C. chairman and all-around establishment figure named Ed Gillespie \u2014 hired an erstwhile Trump campaign operative and reinvented himself in the president\u2019s image. He began to speak out against the removal of Confederate monuments and in favor of the travel ban. He spoke about the danger of \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d even though Virginia has none, and ran campaign ads about Latino gang violence that prompted a rare public rebuke from Obama.It was hard to tell how this affected Sorenson\u2019s race, though the summer poll wasn\u2019t good; Reid was down by seven. But the race, Sorenson knew, was always going to come down to turnout. The weekend after Labor Day would hopefully set the tone for the fall, when, with any luck, the name recognition they\u2019d worked to foster might begin to translate into voter commitments. When returning summer volunteers arrived, they found a more mature operation: there was a sign-in table in the entryway, three times the turnout and a campaign staff large enough for one person to do check in, one person to divide the turf and a third to guide the orientations.Reid as a candidate seemed looser and more confident. He\u2019d received recent endorsements from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, and was willing to talk about more difficult subjects. \u201cThere\u2019s some hesitation among people of color to put up yard signs\u201d for a Democrat, he told a group of volunteers, \u201cafter what we\u2019ve seen, down in Charlottesville and elsewhere, with the emboldening of white supremacists.\u201d He did not seem like the sort of person who\u2019d ever had reason to refer to white supremacy. He was, however, still making the same joke about giving an award to whoever had traveled the farthest to volunteer.For every volunteer who saw fit to challenge the campaign\u2019s authority or its expertise, however, there were half a dozen there for a political education. If everybody hated the tolls, more than one canvasser asked, why were they so high? Well, the campaign answered, the Australian firm that owned the Dulles Greenway had donated $8,000 to Delegate Greason. There was something about the modesty of that figure that got even distant volunteers incensed on behalf of the local community. The conflicts surrounding Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel and the emoluments clause were exasperating but remote in their immensity, whereas a $6 toll for a $2.29 bottle of milk was an affront you could grasp.With 11 days to go before the election, their ground strategy shifted from the voter-commitment stage to the final get-out-the-vote effort; on the campaign\u2019s final Saturday, they enlisted 205 volunteers to go door to door helping voters articulate an explicit plan for when and how they\u2019d go to the polls on Tuesday. The race, as Sorenson predicted, was going to come down to turnout on the margins: their tracking poll had them in a dead heat. Sorenson\u2019s estimate was that Reid needed 13,150 votes to win, and it was easy for her to imagine that the final tallies would be within the 1 percent margin that would trigger an automatic recount. With the race tightening, Greason sent mailers that described Reid as a radical leftist who had taken \u201ctens of thousands of dollars from New York, Washington and California.\u201d Sorenson showed it to me and shrugged. \u201cWell, that last part\u2019s true.\u201dSorenson was grateful for all the money and help from her outside volunteers, but what most moved her was when she felt someone had made the organizational leap from political fury to political identification. When one of her Sister District captains in Maryland asked for a yard sign, Sorenson furrowed her brow and asked her why she wanted one on the other side of the river. The volunteer simply said, \u201cWe need to expand what we think of as our own backyard.\u201d Sorenson didn\u2019t have a lot of time for mawkishness, but that idea, she said, \u201cis just beautiful to me.\u201d And she could appreciate whatever it was that got people newly involved in politics and kept them there. If Indivisible wanted to call Virginia \u201cthe first statewide referendum on Trump,\u201d that was fine with her, as long as they didn\u2019t set expectations so high that their support couldn\u2019t survive a disappointment.The foot traffic \u2014 not just the usual folks from D.C. or Maryland, but people who came from California, Florida and Iowa \u2014 was so steady that the campaign began to run out of clipboards. Volunteers would arrive, muddy and soaked, peel off their clear ponchos and hand over their unreadably macerated voter rolls. By midafternoon, they were almost finished with the fifth complete pass they\u2019d done, over their 11-day \u201cmobilization window,\u201d of all 10,000 doors in their universe. Most returnees declared that everyone on their lists had either voted already or was just waiting for a spouse to come watch the kids; some of them stopped Sorenson to tell her stories about how they took a moment at the end of their shifts to circle back around and check on these promissory replies, and more often than not they encountered \u201cI voted\u201d stickers. Then they\u2019d be handed a new packet and sent back out into the rain. Someone in need of reprieve asked Sorenson when she planned to wrap things up for the day. \u201cWhen do you stop? If your nearest polling place closes at 7:00 and is two minutes away, you stop at 6:58.\u201dSorenson didn\u2019t feel she could really trust the numbers that were coming in \u2014 turnout, she thought, couldn\u2019t realistically be as high as it seemed to be \u2014 but by 4 o\u2019clock she could no longer ignore the fact that most polling places had already far exceeded the totals they usually showed in off years. She dealt with her mounting anxiety by making new spreadsheets to compare precinct-level historical data and devoted her last hour of her campaign\u2019s last day to one final round of phone-banking to voters in what she worried was her one underperforming precinct.The campaign party was at a favorite strip-mall wine bar. Sorenson went home to change, thinking she might have a moment to herself before the results came in, but by the time she and the rest of her team arrived, 90 percent of Loudoun\u2019s precincts were reporting. Reid\u2019s race was one of the first calls. He won with more than 17,000 votes, by at least 17 points. Shoals of well-wishers formed around Sorenson, touching her arms and shoulders and yelling through their tears. \u201cYou are so [expletive] awesome,\u201c one said. \u201cYou brought happiness back into our lives,\u201d said another.Sorenson made her way through the crowd slowly and with only a small, hesitant, curious smile. Every few minutes the growing crowd reacted to new results. Wins at the top of the ticket brought sighs of relief, but the shouted announcement of each successive delegate victory triggered gasps and whoops of astonishment: the first Asian-American woman, the first two Latina women, the first out lesbian, the first trans woman, an African-American woman, even a woman in a Trump district; altogether at least 11 new Democratic women, seven from Northern Virginia alone, in a swell that seemed likely to result in 16 flipped districts for a tied House. Eventually Sorenson sat down with her finance and field directors \u2014 the three young women, Reid later proclaimed, who organized a legion of volunteers and brought them to victory \u2014 to eat some cheese; she particularly liked the kind of Brie they had there, which is why they chose the venue for the party. She stopped to read a congratulatory text from \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s guy.\u201dHer finance director looked over at her and asked, through a flood of tears: \u201cHow are you so calm? I feel like we\u2019ve all been in our little bubble, but look\u201d \u2014 she gestured toward the television overhead \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re on MSNBC! How are you not crying?\u201dSorenson just smiled her smile of mellow detachment, and finally spoke. \u201cI just kind of want to throw my phone into the ocean.\u201dGideon Lewis-Kraus is a writer at large for the magazine.

{"Headline": "As Wild Salmon Decline, Norway Pressures Its Giant Fish Farms", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySKJERJEHAMN, Norway \u2014 As a teenager, Ola Braanaas kept a few fish in an aquarium in his bedroom. Now, at 55, he keeps a lot more of them: around 1.2 million just in one windswept spot off the stunning coast of Norway, a giant farm with six large, circular structures each containing around 200,000 fish.Once a rarity on global dinner tables, salmon is a staple today, thanks to a fish farming industry that has expanded at breakneck speed in recent decades, including in Norway, where in 2016 around 1.18 million metric tons were produced.But now, Norwegian fish farmers face new curbs designed to protect the country\u2019s stocks of wild salmon, rules that have ignited anger from the industry and its opponents, prompting threats of court challenges from both sides.The wild Norwegian salmon are members of an ancient species that, early in its life cycle, heads down river, swimming through Norway\u2019s famous fjords, and out to saltwater feeding grounds, before returning to their native rivers to spawn.In recent years, however, the wild salmon population has more than halved, partly because of the spread of sea lice, parasites that feast on the mucus and skin of the fish before moving on to the muscle and fat, making the fish vulnerable to infections and sometimes killing them.Sea lice, like the salmon, have existed in the ocean for eons but have emerged as a huge problem for the fish farms, where they multiply in such numbers that they kill farmed fish and pose a risk to young wild salmon as they pass the holding pens on their way to the open sea.The lice problem is so bad that the worldwide supply of salmon on sale, the overwhelming majority of which is farmed, fell significantly last year, with Norway, the largest producer, especially hard hit.To contain the problem, a system came into force in Norway on Oct. 15, under which farms in regions that are judged to severely threaten wild salmon numbers will have their production frozen and potentially, in future years, cut. If the lice are brought under control, then output can be increased.Mr. Braanaas, the owner of Firda Seafood, says that there are already rules in place to control the lice, and that he will go to court if he is ordered to reduce production because of problems from other farms in his region. It is, he says, a \u201cStasi system,\u201d a reference to the secret police of East Germany.But there are other problems, too, beyond sea lice. Rune Jensen, the head of SalmonCamera, says that wild fish, like cod, congregate around salmon farms, attracted by the food there. These predators eat the young wild salmon in greater numbers than normal as they make their way out to sea, or sometimes even force them into the farm cages.But activists say the biggest threat is the genetic impact of farmed fish that escape their pens, reproduce with wild salmon and produce offspring ill-equipped to survive.Over the last decade, fish farmers have reported more than 200,000 salmon escaping on average each year, though the real figures may be as much as four times higher than that in the years 2005 to 2011, according to one study.The impact has been observed by Norway\u2019s anglers. Few people know the fishing grounds of the Dale River as well as Inge Sandven, the head of the Dale Hunters\u2019 and Anglers\u2019 Club. In just 15 minutes at one river pool, set against a spectacular backdrop of tree-covered hills, he had three bites but no catches.Then, the rod strained, and he slowly reeled in a small, shiny, olive brown salmon weighing a couple of pounds. Just by looking at it, as it thrashed in a net, Mr. Sandven could tell a lot about the fish: It was male and had probably spent three years in this river and one winter at sea.But what he could not say: whether it was a pure wild salmon.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to tell. It looks good, but I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Sandven said, when asked if it might have farmed salmon genes. \u201cIt\u2019s a 50/50 chance \u2014 that\u2019s the experience of this year,\u201d he added, before releasing his catch.Mr. Sandven knows this because he supervises a wild salmon hatchery, and takes DNA samples from fish caught in this river before they are used for breeding. Recently, around half have failed the wild salmon purity test.The genetic makeup is important, said Alv Arne Lyse, a fisheries biologist at the Norwegian Association of Hunters and Anglers. In farm fish pens, where there are no predators, the most aggressive salmon are the most successful, since the only concern is to get as much food as possible.Escaped salmon then pass that trait on to hybrid wild salmon, who are then, to mix metaphors, like lambs to the slaughter out in the open seas.That is because in the ocean, awareness is far more important for survival than aggressiveness, as danger lurks all around.\u201cThe offspring of farmed fish are more aggressive, but when they go out in the sea they have very high mortality,\u201d Mr. Lyse said, adding that they also often lack the homing instinct to return to a specific river, since they were spawned in commercial hatcheries.While previously pollution was a huge problem in aquaculture, he said, now \u201cthe only threats that are not under control are the genetic impact from escaped fish and sea lice.\u201dThe fish farmers argue that they play a vital role in feeding the planet, and that they produce a crop worth $8 billion annually to Norway, accounting for about 8 percent of the country\u2019s exports.The Norwegian government already has rules requiring farms to test the quantity of sea lice in pens and to take action if they exceed the limits.Marine Harvest uses so-called cleaner fish that feed on sea lice to help combat the problem. It is also investing in new techniques designed to eliminate the risk of escapes of farmed salmon and to cut lice numbers.These include novel ideas such as the \u201cegg\u201d \u2014 a solid oval-shaped pen, yet to be constructed, which is enclosed, preventing any risk of salmon escaping, and making it harder for sea lice to enter and spread.Along with his fellow Green Warriors, Mr. Oddekalv argues that the scale of fish farming in Norway is unsustainable, and that huge volumes of uneaten feed and fish excrement pollute the seabed. Over the years farmers have been criticized for using antibiotics in fish feed, something that is now barred in Norway, though additives designed to curb the lice also find their way into the food chain, Mr. Oddekalv argues.\u201cIf people knew this they wouldn\u2019t eat salmon,\u201d he said, describing the farmed fish as \u201cthe most toxic food in the world.\u201dIn a statement, Norway\u2019s fisheries minister, Per Sandberg, described the new system for dealing with the sea lice problem as \u201cfair\u201d and constructed on a \u201csafe legal basis.\u201dHe said that \u201cas in all science, there are knowledge gaps,\u201d but that scientists agree that lice have a negative impact on wild salmon and that it would \u201cbe wrong not to act at all, due to some gaps in our knowledge.\u201dAt his home, which can be reached only by boat, Mr. Braanaas conceded that the Norwegian salmon farming industry has \u201cmade a lot of mistakes.\u201d But he insisted there were many fewer problems there than in other parts of the world, like Chile, where he said that regulation is lighter and \u201cgreed takes over.\u201dAs a self-made businessman whose parents mortgaged their home to help finance his first fish farm, Mr. Braanaas is proud of the company he has built and of the employment it provides in a remote part of Europe. And he believes some of its critics are motivated by a sentimental reverence for one particular species of fish.\u201cIn India, they have the holy cow,\u201d he said, reflecting over a beer. \u201cIn Norway, it\u2019s the sacred salmon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Mugabe\u2019s Rapid Fall: A Firing, a Feud and a First Lady", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 The rapid fall of Zimbabwe\u2019s president, whose legendary guile and ruthlessness helped him outmaneuver countless adversaries over nearly four decades, probably has surprised no one more than Robert Mugabe himself.For years, he was so confident of his safety \u2014 and his potency \u2014 that he took monthlong vacations away from Zimbabwe after Christmas, never facing any threat during his long, predictable absences. Even at 93, his tight grip on the country\u2019s ruling party and his control over the military made his power seem impervious to question.But in just a matter of days, Mr. Mugabe, who ruled his nation since independence in 1980, was largely stripped of his authority, even as he still clung to the presidency.In a much-anticipated speech on Sunday night, Mr. Mugabe, instead of announcing his resignation as most of the country had expected, stunned Zimbabwe by refusing to say he was stepping down. While he conceded that his country was \u201cgoing through a difficult patch,\u201d he gave no sign that he recognized, or accepted, how severely the ground had shifted under him in such a short time.Earlier in the day, the governing ZANU-PF party, over which he had always exercised total domination, expelled Mr. Mugabe as leader, with cheers and dancing erupting after the vote. He was given a deadline of noon on Monday to resign or face impeachment by Parliament.Just days earlier, on Wednesday, soldiers put him under house arrest, and his 52-year-old wife, Grace Mugabe, whose ambition to succeed him contributed to his downfall, has not been seen in public since.But in his speech, Mr. Mugabe even declared that he would preside over his governing party\u2019s congress in a few weeks. After 37 years in control of the nation, he was refusing to let go easily.\u201cHe crossed the red line, and we couldn\u2019t allow that to continue,\u201d said Douglas Mahiya, a leader of the war veterans\u2019 association, a group that has acted as the military\u2019s proxy in the country\u2019s political battles while allowing uniformed generals to remain publicly neutral.A few hours after he was fired, Mr. Mnangagwa, fearing arrest, fled with a son into neighboring Mozambique, where he has strong military ties. He eventually made his way to South Africa, allies said.July Moyo, a close ally of Mr. Mnangagwa, said the vice president had prepared himself for the possibility of being fired. \u201cHe accepted that things can turn very bad, so he had conditioned himself,\u201d Mr. Moyo said.Several hours before the vice president escaped to Mozambique, Christopher Mutsvangwa, the head of the war veterans\u2019 association and one of Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s closest allies, had boarded a plane to South Africa.Over the following days, Mr. Mutsvangwa met with South African intelligence officers, he said, warning them of a possible military intervention in Zimbabwe. He said he had tried to persuade South African officials not to describe any intervention as a \u201ccoup\u201d \u2014 an important concession to get from South Africa, the regional power.Though this account could not be verified with South African officials on Sunday, the South African government did not mention the word \u201ccoup\u201d in its official statement after the military intervention occurred on Wednesday.\u201cI knew that the way they were driving, the military, inevitably, there would be one at one stage or another,\u201d Mr. Mutsvangwa said, referring to a military intervention.While Mr. Mutsvangwa worked on South African officials, Zimbabwe\u2019s longtime top military commander, Gen. Constantino Chiwenga, was in China on an official trip. He was tipped off while abroad that Mr. Mugabe had ordered him arrested upon his return home, according to several people close to the military. The police were going to grab the general as soon as his plane touched down, on Nov. 12.But as General Chiwenga prepared to land, soldiers loyal to him infiltrated the airport. His troops \u2014 wearing the uniforms of baggage handlers \u2014 surprised and quickly overwhelmed the police. Before departing, the general is said to have told the police officers that he would \u201cdeal\u201d with their commander, a Mugabe loyalist.Within just a couple of days, tanks had rumbled into the capital and soldiers had effectively deposed Mr. Mugabe.The president\u2019s decision to fire his vice president and arrest the general was the culmination of a long \u2014 and increasingly vicious and personal \u2014 battle inside ZANU-PF, the party that has controlled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980. The so-called Lacoste faction was led by Mr. Mnangagwa, whose nickname is the Crocodile, and was backed by the military and war veterans.The rival faction was led by the president\u2019s wife and supported by the police, whose loyalty Mr. Mugabe had ensured by, among other moves, naming a nephew to a top command. This faction included mostly younger politicians with no experience in the war of liberation and was christened Generation 40, or G-40, by Jonathan Moyo, a fearless, extremely ambitious politician widely regarded as the mastermind behind this group.As Lacoste and G-40 fought each other to eventually succeed Mr. Mugabe, the president did not give either side his declaration of support. To both factions, the biggest factor was Mr. Mugabe\u2019s age and increasingly visible frailty. It was only a matter of time before \u201cnature will take its course\u201d and \u201cthe old man goes,\u201d as the political class said.Time was on Lacoste\u2019s side. Once nature did take its course, power would naturally slip to Mr. Mnangagwa and his military backers, they believed.Mr. Mnangagwa remained largely quiet, refraining from responding to attacks, and treated Mr. Mugabe with extreme deference. Whenever Mr. Mugabe flew home from a trip, state media invariably showed Mr. Mnangagwa greeting the president on the tarmac, displaying an almost obsequious smile and body language.To the younger members in G-40, time was against them. Their biggest asset, Mrs. Mugabe, would lose all value once her husband died. So they were in a rush to get a transfer of power while Mr. Mugabe was still alive.Just a few months ago, Mr. Moyo confided in a friend that he was \u201cless than confident\u201d about G-40\u2019s standing with the president. Despite his efforts to win over the president through Mrs. Mugabe, Mr. Moyo still remained unsure about the \u201cold man\u2019s standing vis-\u00e0-vis Mnangagwa and Chiwenga,\u201d said the friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conversation had been private.\u201cHe felt he had to disqualify Mnangagwa very soon because the old man was still tentative,\u201d the friend said.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s downfall was rooted in his wife\u2019s decision to become a political force in mid-2014, most politicians and experts believe.\u201cMrs. Mugabe\u2019s entry into politics caused elite rupture in Zimbabwe,\u201d said Tendai Biti, a lawyer, opposition politician and former finance minister in a coalition government a few years ago. \u201cThis coup was the result of a disagreement between people eating at the same table, whereas most coups in Africa are done by people eating under the table and receiving crumbs.\u201dWhy Mrs. Mugabe, now 52, suddenly dove into politics is not exactly clear. Married for decades to Mr. Mugabe, she had been known as \u201cGucci Grace,\u201d someone interested in shopping and leading a lavish lifestyle. She was a typist in the presidential pool when she and Mr. Mugabe began an affair while the president\u2019s first wife, Sally, was dying of cancer. Unlike the much-beloved first wife, the second Mrs. Mugabe was widely disliked among Zimbabweans.Some politicians and experts point to the hand of Mr. Moyo, the originator of the G-40 name, for Mrs. Mugabe\u2019s political intentions.In ZANU-PF\u2019s ever-shifting alliances, Mr. Moyo had a checkered past. In 2004, he was expelled from the party after planning a power play with \u2014 critically \u2014 none other than Mr. Mnangagwa himself, who managed to escape politically unscathed. Feeling betrayed by Mr. Mnangagwa, Mr. Moyo vowed never to work with him again, setting off a decade-long feud that fed into the recent military takeover.Mr. Moyo, reportedly admired by Mr. Mugabe for his intelligence, was rehabilitated, rejoined the party and was given ministerial positions in the cabinet.But in June 2014, Mr. Moyo was again on the outs. At a funeral for a party stalwart at National Heroes Acre, a burial ground and national monument in Harare, the capital, Mr. Mugabe criticized Mr. Moyo for causing dissension in the party. The president referred to him as a \u201cweevil\u201d \u2014 an insect that eats corn, Zimbabwe\u2019s staple food, from the inside.\u201cEven in ZANU-PF, we have the weevils,\u201d the president said. \u201cBut should we keep them? No.\u201dTo secure his survival, Mr. Moyo urged Mrs. Mugabe to enter politics, according to politicians, friends and analysts.\u201cHe preyed on her fears,\u201d said Dewa Mavhinga, a Zimbabwe researcher for Human Rights Watch, referring to Mr. Moyo. \u201cYou\u2019re a young wife with an old husband in his sunset moments. You have to guarantee your future. You need people who are loyal to you. And who better to protect your interests than yourself.\u201dVery rapidly, Mrs. Mugabe and her allies orchestrated the removal of rivals, including Joice Mujuru, a vice president, as well as Mr. Mutsvangwa, who had been Mr. Mugabe\u2019s minister of war veterans affairs.But even as the president\u2019s medical trips to Singapore were getting increasingly frequent, he was not making a final decision on his succession.Time was running out.And so, Mr. Moyo, shortly after expressing his growing frustrations to his friend, appeared to go for broke. In July, in a meeting of party leaders, he launched a direct attack on Mr. Mnangagwa, presenting a 72-minute video said to show his rival\u2019s duplicity and desire to topple the president.At the same time, Mrs. Mugabe intensified her faction\u2019s attacks, describing Mr. Mnangagwa as a \u201ccoward\u201d and \u201ccoup plotter.\u201dAt a rally in the city of Bulawayo early this month, some youths, presumably from the rival Lacoste faction, began heckling Mrs. Mugabe, calling her a \u201cthief.\u201d\u201cIf you were paid to boo me, go ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cI am the first lady, and I will stand for the truth. Bring the soldiers and let them shoot me.\u201dThe heckling visibly angered Mr. Mugabe, who immediately accused Mr. Mnangagwa of being behind it.\u201cDid I err in appointing Mr. Mnangagwa as my deputy?\u201d the president said. \u201cIf I erred, I will drop him even tomorrow.\u201dTwo days later, he fired Mr. Mnangagwa, opening the path for Mrs. Mugabe to become vice president and, once nature took its course, her husband\u2019s successor.Mrs. Mugabe and her allies had finally won. But the victory would soon prove Pyrrhic.As the Lacoste faction solidified the takedown of Mr. Mugabe, party officials on Sunday removed Mrs. Mugabe as head of the ZANU-PF Women\u2019s League and barred her from the party for life. Mr. Moyo, too, was barred forever. Mr. Mugabe\u2019s second vice president, Phelekezela Mphoko, who had served for three years, was fired.The ending was much sweeter for Mr. Mnangagwa: On Sunday, the party named him as its new leader.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Try to Block Moore\u2019s Path as Candidate Denies Sexual Misconduct", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans scrambled on Friday to find a way to block Roy S. Moore\u2019s path to the Senate, exploring extraordinary measures to rid themselves of their own nominee in Alabama after accusations emerged that he had made sexual advances on four teenage girls when he was in his 30s.\u201cI have never known this woman, or anything,\u201d said Mr. Moore, who described the accusations as \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201dRepublican senators and their advisers, in a flurry of phone calls, emails and text messages, discussed fielding a write-in candidate, pushing Alabama\u2019s governor to delay the Dec. 12 special election or even not seating Mr. Moore at all should he be elected. In an interview, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, declined to say whether he would agree to seat Mr. Moore should he win. Mr. McConnell deferred a question about a possible write-in campaign by Senator Luther Strange, the current occupant of the seat, to Mr. Strange.The frenzy reflected not just the worry over the Senate seat once held by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general, but also the broader danger of the Republican Party\u2019s being associated with Mr. Moore.If Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee, wins next month, Mr. McConnell\u2019s majority will shrink to one, possibly imperiling the Republican push to overhaul the tax code and most everything else that lawmakers are aiming to do to reverse their spiral before the midterm elections. It could also raise at least the potential that Democrats could seize control of the Senate in 2018, by holding all of their endangered seats and winning Republican seats in Nevada and Arizona.And Mr. Moore\u2019s interview within the sympathetic confines of Mr. Hannity\u2019s show, which was also an initial safe harbor for Mr. Akin in 2012, made Republicans in the capital only more determined that he had to step aside.\u201cI don\u2019t remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother,\u201d Mr. Moore told Mr. Hannity. Asked by Mr. Hannity if he ever dated teenagers when he was in his 30s, Mr. Moore equivocated, replying, \u201cNot generally, no.\u201dSome Senate Republicans have encouraged Mr. Strange \u2014 who lost to Mr. Moore in a bitterly contested Republican runoff election in September \u2014 to run as a write-in candidate, an option Mr. Strange is considering, according to Republicans who have spoken with him. But some Republicans believe he would do little more than play spoiler, ensuring either that Mr. Moore is elected by taking votes Mr. Jones would otherwise get or that the Democrat wins by siphoning support from Mr. Moore among Republicans seeking a palatable third option.Mr. McConnell and Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, spoke with Mr. Strange about the prospect immediately after the Moore news broke on Thursday, according to Republicans familiar with the conversation. And Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who won re-election in 2010 as a write-in candidate, was planning to discuss logistics with Mr. Strange this weekend.Asked Friday if he thought Mr. Strange should run as a write-in candidate, Mr. McConnell said only that \u201cyou\u2019d have to ask Luther what his intentions are, given this development.\u201dRepublicans in Washington and Alabama have also approached other potential candidates about a write-in effort, including Representative Robert B. Aderholt, a mainstream conservative from northern Alabama. But it is unclear that any prominent Republican will be willing to mount a wild-card campaign for the Senate unless Mr. Moore stands down first.Absent Mr. Moore\u2019s cooperation, Republicans in Washington have conferred with election lawyers to explore other long-shot options for replacing or marginalizing him, several of which would probably lead to a clash in court with Mr. Moore and his supporters.One approach that Republicans are considering, according to people briefed on the deliberations, would involve asking Gov. Kay Ivey to order a new date for the election \u2014 sometime early next year \u2014 and giving the party time to ease Mr. Moore from the race.Alabama election law requires candidates to withdraw at least 76 days before an election in order to be replaced on the ballot, a deadline Mr. Moore has already missed.Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist close to Mr. McConnell, said presidential intervention was needed to bring any order to the situation in Alabama. He suggested that President Trump could personally nudge Mr. Moore out of the race and back a write-in campaign by Mr. Strange, or perhaps Mr. Sessions, a popular figure with Alabama Republicans.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a wild-card politician, who may or may not support your agenda, who\u2019s now got horrific allegations of molestation of a child,\u201d Mr. Jennings said, referring to Mr. Moore. \u201cIt strikes me that the people of Alabama would listen to the president.\u201dA spokesman for Ms. Ivey did not reply to an email asking about her intentions, but she has been in contact with Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, according to Republican officials.But there is no apparent precedent for rescheduling an election so close to the planned vote, Republicans acknowledged. In addition to state election laws, such an extreme step could also run afoul of federal voting rights law.Then there is the possibility that if Mr. Moore stayed in the race and won, the members of the Senate would deny him a seat.\u201cI ended up making a motion to expel the chairman of the Finance Committee of my own party, which was approved unanimously, and he subsequently resigned,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cSo character does count in America and in the United States Senate.\u201dWhile maintaining his typically stoic public face, Mr. McConnell was said to be highly irritated that, after he had fended off problematic candidates in recent years, Mr. Moore had instantly revived the type of difficulties Republicans suffered with Mr. Akin and other hard-liners.But in Alabama, Republicans appeared far more willing to give Mr. Moore the benefit of the doubt.\u201cLet\u2019s let this thing work out,\u201d said Trip Pittman, a state senator. \u201cYou\u2019re innocent until proven otherwise.\u201dMr. Pittman urged Mr. Moore to aggressively rebut the claims. That, he said, would be \u201creally helpful.\u201dAlabama\u2019s congressional Republicans remained silent on Friday, wanting to see how emphatically Mr. Moore responded to the charges, but there were conversations about eventually issuing a joint statement. Some of them were rattled \u2014 and not just because of the Moore story.As members of the state\u2019s House delegation arrived Thursday in Birmingham, Ala., for a fund-raiser with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, there were hydraulic problems with the plane as it touched down. Shortly after enduring a bumpy landing, their phones lit up to reveal The Post\u2019s report.For their part, Democrats appear to be ready to join the fray. The party had been holding back, in part out of fear that getting involved could nationalize the election and compromise Mr. Jones\u2019s brand as an independent-minded local candidate.But on Friday, Democratic donors appeared increasingly interested in the race. Stephen J. Cloobeck, a Nevada hotel magnate who contributed $500,000 last year to a Senate-focused Democratic \u201csuper PAC,\u201d described Mr. Moore as \u201cdespicable\u201d and said he would gladly direct money to Mr. Jones.\u201cIf there\u2019s an event, I will participate, because I have a 14-year-old little girl, and if anyone touched her, I\u2019d kill them,\u201d Mr. Cloobeck said. \u201cI\u2019d kill them.\u201dJonathan Martin reported from Washington, and Alexander Burns from New York.

{"Headline": "Chinese Phone Maker Bets Big With a Premium Price", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHENZHEN, China \u2014 The phone takes dazzling photos and sports advanced artificial intelligence. Its display stretches gloriously from edge to edge. And at nearly $1,000, it pushes into eye-watering territory on price.But the Mate 10 Pro isn\u2019t the latest high-end offering from Samsung or Apple. It comes from China \u2014 a country that, for all its growing sophistication in technology, has yet to produce a name like Lexus, Canon or Samsung that consumers around the globe associate with premium quality at premium prices.Huawei Technologies, the new smartphone\u2019s creator, thinks the world is ready to pay top dollar for a Chinese product. It is rolling out the Mate 10 Pro \u2014 plus two sibling devices, one less expensive and lower spec, the other pricier and sleeker \u2014 in Europe, in the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia. And it is in talks with AT&T to offer the phones in the United States, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions are not public.\u201cWe see good signs that people have seen the brand change to a large degree,\u201d to one that is \u201cstylish and innovative,\u201d said Glory Cheung, Huawei\u2019s marketing chief for consumer devices. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very good sign for us.\u201dStill, Ms. Cheung said, Huawei would rather spend on developing smarter features and better technology than on marketing, even as she acknowledged the importance of building an emotional bond with users. The challenge for the company on that last front is significant: Compared with Apple or Samsung, Huawei has much further to go in forging that elusive something that leads someone to commit to a brand.Even in China, many people still view Huawei devices as good value for the money and not much else.Li Haoran, a 24-year-old accountant in Beijing, is a longtime Apple user. Would she switch to Huawei?\u201cNot for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019d consider buying Huawei phones for my family, because they are relatively cheap.\u201dAs for the Mate 10 series, Li Weitao, a 40-year-old marketer in Shanghai who is no relation to Li Haoran, said that for more than $600, \u201cyou should probably get an iPhone.\u201dFounded in Shenzhen three decades ago, Huawei was already one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of telecommunications equipment when it released its first Android smartphone in 2009. Its earliest handsets were run-of-the-mill in looks and performance. But Huawei has since invested more in design and technology, opening a design center in London and a research and development facility in Finland.With the Mate 10 series, Huawei is debuting one of the fruits of its research: a processor dedicated to artificial-intelligence tasks such as identifying people in photos and translating text.Christophe Coutelle, vice president of software marketing for Huawei, said the new processor let the phones perform such tasks more quickly, with less power and \u2014 as no data needs to be sent to a faraway server \u2014 with better privacy protection.\u201cNot everyone is willing to share all of their information, pictures and everything with cloud-based services,\u201d he said.The emphasis on privacy could help Huawei crack its last big untapped market: the United States. The company\u2019s experience there has been fraught.Its network-equipment business has effectively been banned in the United States since a congressional report said in 2012 that Huawei gear could be used by Beijing to spy on Americans. The company\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei, was once an engineer in China\u2019s military. Huawei has said its products pose no threat to security.Huawei\u2019s international presence and diverse work force make it more of a global company than a Chinese one, Ms. Cheung said. Whether Huawei is a global name \u2014 and an appealing one \u2014 is another matter.\u201cThe brand still lacks personality,\u201d Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester, said in an email. \u201cThe focus is still too much on technical specifications and functionalities.\u201dFiguring out how to strike a chord with ordinary consumers was never going to be easy for Huawei, which has spent most of its existence selling back-end equipment to mobile carriers.It has enlisted Scarlett Johansson to star in ads, and teamed up with Porsche and Leica on design. Yet Huawei still has \u201cvery much of an engineering culture,\u201d Mr. Coutelle said. In conversation, employees rarely fail to mention how much the company spends on research and development (more than 10 percent of revenue) or the number of its workers involved in research (nearly half).The company\u2019s attitude, Mr. Coutelle said, had long been that its products spoke for themselves \u2014 that there was no need to hard-sell anyone on their superiority. \u201cBut I think this is changing.\u201dHuawei has been touring the world introducing users to its devices\u2019 clever but low-key features. To take a screenshot, for instance, you knock twice on the screen with your knuckle. Drawing an S with your knuckle takes a screenshot of the entire length of a website or app \u2014 the better to share paywalled newspaper articles like this one.Under-the-hood advancements may not drive sales unless Huawei brings them to the less expensive, midtier phones that will almost surely remain its biggest sellers, said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst at the research firm IDC.Mr. Jeronimo said he had laughed when he heard Huawei executives talk, years ago, about becoming a top-three phone maker. Today, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they become No. 1.\u201dOwen Guo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asking the Big Questions of General Electric", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThat Mr. Flannery is asking \u201cwhy do we exist?\u201d is not entirely surprising. He is, after all, a man with many years ahead of him to make some hard decisions, fundamentally reshape the company Thomas Edison founded and rebase its share price for the hard restructuring ahead. By contrast, his predecessor, Jeff Immelt (a.k.a. Two Jets), was fighting for time, struggling to justify what was already done and had been previously promised during his 16 years running the company.But the about-face from Mr. Immelt to Mr. Flannery has outdone the usual kitchen-sinking that accompanies the passing from one chief executive to the next. It\u2019s certainly a stark contrast from Mr. Immelt\u2019s own transition from Jack Welch in 2001. And that has raised a key question for G.E. shareholders: How did the board allow Mr. Immelt to continue for so long without intervention? If it was so obvious to Mr. Flannery and many investors that G.E. was overspending on dividends, flubbing on acquisitions and committing to too many second-rate businesses, what were G.E.\u2019s 18 directors thinking?Mr. Flannery has already clarified that G.E.\u2019s board is oversized, under-engaged and badly in need of a housecleaning. So perhaps the most encouraging development to be found in Mr. Flannery\u2019s 57-page slide show on Monday is a plan to put just 12 directors up for a vote next year, including three new ones. That means it is parting company with half the current lineup. G.E. will also create a new \u201cfinance and capital allocation committee\u201d with increased oversight of the company\u2019s acquisition and buyback strategy.The composition of the new board will include, among others, a representative of Trian Partners, the activist fund manager led by Nelson Peltz. But that person can\u2019t be the only director willing to question the strategy, dig through the numbers and, where needed, prod Mr. Flannery to shift gears. The era of the all-powerful G.E. boss, with two jets at his disposal in case one breaks down, is over. That, beyond any numerical pledges, should be the most important statement to emerge on this investor day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$1.5 Trillion Tax Cut Passed by House in Mostly Party-Line Vote", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Thirteen Republicans voted against the bill, and no Democrats voted for it.\u2022 A new analysis from Congress\u2019s bipartisan tax referee shows that under the Senate\u2019s version of the bill, lower-income Americans would see their taxes go up in 2021.\u2022 The analysis roiled the Senate Finance Committee, which is debating the bill ahead of a vote that could happen as soon as Thursday night.\u2022 Before the House vote, President Trump visited Capitol Hill to rally the Republican lawmakers behind the legislation.The Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress\u2019s bipartisan referee on tax policy, said on Thursday that the amended Senate\u2019s version of the tax bill will raise taxes on low-income Americans beginning in 2021, in what appears to be a side effect of the bill\u2019s decision to repeal the so-called individual mandate that requires most people buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.The committee also forecast that taxpayers earning $75,000 or less would see, as a group, large tax increases in 2027, if the individual tax cuts in the bill expire as scheduled at the end of 2025. Those tax increases would be relative to current law \u2014 meaning that those taxpayers would be worse off in 2027 than they would have been if the bill had not become law.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, called the joint committee analysis \u201castounding\u201d and warned that middle-class taxpayers would get \u201cclobbered\u201d under the latest Republican plan.\u201cWhen you\u2019re reaching for the cranberry sauce, Republicans are going be reaching for your pocketbooks to give handouts to multinational corporations,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said that the appearance of a tax increase was a mirage that is the result of arcane scoring rules. Because people will no longer have to purchase health insurance, they may no longer receive tax credit subsidies for insurance that they do not purchase.\u201cWithout those credits, they see an overall uptick in their tax liability,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.The debate then devolved into an argument over what really counts as an increase and the murkiness of government scorekeeping, which Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, called \u201cridiculous.\u201dUninterested in letting go of numbers that supported his argument that the Republican tax plan is bad for the middle class, Mr. Wyden dismissed Mr. Toomey\u2019s concerns.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard a senator try to psychoanalyze a Joint Committee on Taxation table,\u201d he said.Representatives voted along party lines, with the exception of 13 Republicans, many of whom fought to keep the deduction for state and local taxes.\u201cI just have too many constituents who are going to see their taxes go up,\u201d Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, who voted against the bill, said at a news conference. \u201cYou\u2019re taking more money from a place like New York in order to pay for deeper tax cuts elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Zeldin said.Of the 13 Republicans who voted against the bill, nine were from New York and New Jersey: Mr. Zeldin, Dan Donovan, John J. Faso, Peter T. King, Elise Stefanik, Rodney Frelinghuysen, Christopher H. Smith, Leonard Lance and Frank A. LoBiondo. Three California Republicans voted against the bill, Darrell Issa, Dana Rohrabacher and Tom McClintock, as did one North Carolina Republican, Walter B. Jones.Mr. Donovan, the lone House Republican from New York City, said he and his New York colleagues wanted to cut taxes. \u201cBut not on the backs of our constituents,\u201d he said.\u201cFor the first time in 31 years we are wiping the tax code clean and replacing it with one that is fairer and simpler for everyone,\u201d said Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California.\u201cFor almost a decade, Americans suffered under Obamanomics,\u201d said Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas. \u201cTheir savings remained decimated, their paychecks were stagnant, and their American dreams were diminished.\u201dNow, he declared, \u201ca new day has dawned.\u201d\u201cWe are on the precipice of passing a fairer, flatter, simpler, more competitive tax code, one built for three percent-plus economic growth,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called the legislation \u201chistoric\u201d and said it \u201crepresents a crucial step to fulfilling our tax reform promise to the American people. But it\u2019s not the final step. We\u2019re Republicans. We believe the tax code doesn\u2019t belong to Washington, it belongs to the American people. We\u2019ll continue to work to make it better and improve at every step of the way.\u201dPaul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the House speaker, took to the floor to loud applause, where he called the tax bill a \u201cgenerational-defining moment.\u201d He held up several charts that showed tax savings for typical households, along with the \u201cpostcard\u201d he said most Americans will be able to use to file their taxes. \u201cNot only do people get to keep more of their own money in their own pocket, but we dramatically simplify the tax system,\u201d he said.\u201cPassing this bill is the single biggest thing we can do to grow the economy, to restore opportunity, and help these middle-income families who are struggling.\u201d\u201cThis is a horror show today,\u201d Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. \u201cThis is a horror show debate. This is a horror show process. But it\u2019s a disaster for the American people. The bill we are debating today will abandon millions of American families.\u201d\u201cThis is a historic moment, but most importantly it\u2019s a missed opportunity,\u201d said Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cWhat we\u2019re being asked to do here today is to raise taxes on 36 million middle-class Americans.\u201dAnother Democrat, Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, began shouting from the lectern about the drawbacks of the bill.\u201cRepublicans and President Trump are doling out tax breaks for companies to move overseas but will take away benefits to hire American veterans right here at home.\u201d\u201cOn behalf of hard working Americans throughout this country I say vote no on H.R. 1. Vote no on H.R. 1 percent.\u201dRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said the package being voted on was not tax reform but \u201ca tax scam.\u201d\u201cWith straight faces and with the speed of light \u2014 I have to give them credit \u2014 they raced this thing through in the dark of night. They\u2019re trying to sell a bill of goods to the middle class that this is in their interest, that this is a middle income tax cut,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cRepublicans are raising taxes on 36 million middle-class families.\u201dThe Senate now has to take up its own version of the tax bill, which is still being debated in the Finance Committee.A vote by the panel could come as early as Thursday night, and the full Senate is planning to vote on the legislation after Thanksgiving. It remains to be seen how the Senate and House will resolve the differences in their bills if the tax cut does, indeed, pass the full Senate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Northern Ireland Is Sinking Into a \u2018Profound Crisis\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBELFAST, Northern Ireland \u2014 The Northern Ireland Assembly\u2019s palatial building in Stormont, in the hills that overlook Belfast, is an eerie place these days.This time last year, its grand lobby bustled with lawmakers, lobbyists and civil servants, but this week it is empty and lifeless. Further inside, a few tourists warmed the blue seats of the debating chamber, rather than the 90 lawmakers elected to work there. Even their microphones had been removed.\u201cIt\u2019s a total ghost town,\u201d said Claire Hanna, one of those lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s dead.\u201dSince that deal, known as the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland has been run mostly by a devolved regional government that must, in effect, be led by a coalition between the region\u2019s largest nationalist party and its largest unionist counterpart.The government stopped working and the assembly stopped meeting. A major overhaul of the region\u2019s ailing health system was postponed, and all long-term decisions about government spending were put on hold.\u201cThis is a more profound crisis than we\u2019ve had at other times in the last 20 years,\u201d said Stephen Farry, the deputy leader of the Alliance Party, a centrist group that does not identify as either nationalist or unionist.The government was shaken again this weekend, with the news that Gerry Adams would stand down as president of Sinn F\u00e9in. His departure at the end of the year may help the party achieve its goal of becoming a palatable coalition partner in the Irish government, but for Northern Ireland the implications are less clear.\u201cThis crisis has a different feel to it,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a much more profound question over the direction of travel and whether power-sharing is sustainable. And that begs the question: What happens next?\u201dIn the short term, civil servants have been left in charge of the day-to-day management of the region. But if the impasse continues, many fear that decisions will be made by ministers in London, a system known as \u201cdirect rule\u201d that the 1998 agreement was meant to end. In the absence of a Northern Irish finance minister, the British government has already made the first step toward \u201cdirect rule\u201d \u2014 passing an interim budget for Northern Ireland on Monday to ensure that salaries can be paid until March.\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be dramatic or anything, but I do think the Good Friday Agreement is effectively dead,\u201d said Ms. Hanna, who represents the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Sinn Fein\u2019s main nationalist rival.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real support for violence, but you can see how quickly things can unravel,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s very bleak, and it is something to worry about.\u201dFor now, civil servants are keeping the machinery of the state in motion. But as unelected employees, they must simply apply the decisions made by the elected government during the last financial year, meaning that they can neither react to changing circumstances nor increase their budgets in line with inflation.This has led to stasis and, in some cases, cuts to jobs and services. In one high-profile case, officials were forced to scrap an intensive support program for around 1,000 of the region\u2019s most vulnerable children and teenagers, even though the program had led to a significant drop in antisocial behavior and a rise in school attendance.Across the region\u2019s charitable sector, which is significantly dependent on state funding, charities have become wary of starting new projects or hiring staff, making them less able to respond to social problems that require new strategies.Yet these administrative challenges have not yet encouraged politicians to reach a settlement. In fact, their differences have increased as the year has developed.When they left the coalition in January, Sinn Fein originally intended to force the resignation of the D.U.P. leader, Arlene Foster, who was accused of corruption. But after Ms. Foster refused to step down, Sinn Fein expanded its demands, calling on the D.U.P. to agree to give the Irish language the same legal status as English and to legalize same-sex marriage. (In Scotland and Wales, the Scottish and Welsh languages already have an equal legal footing with English, and same-sex marriage has been permitted in the rest of the United Kingdom since 2014.)Both sides have been accused of not being truly invested in a compromise.The D.U.P. dismisses this argument and says that in fact, it is Sinn Fein that has ulterior motives for maintaining the standoff. Since Sinn Fein also operates in the Republic of Ireland, it fears that it will harm its reputation among left-wing voters in Dublin if it is forced to pursue neoliberal policies while in government in Belfast, said Sammy Wilson, a D.U.P. lawmaker.Whereas Stormont was once seen as a symbol of hope and progress, citizens of all backgrounds now see it as an embarrassment.\u201cNow, I go up to Stormont and it\u2019s this great big echoey, empty, impotent place,\u201d Ms. Rowledge said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the head of a homeless charity who meets lawmakers at Stormont. She is Ricky Rowledge, not Ricky Routledge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Fight Gets Personal as Senators Spar Over Bill", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the $1.5 trillion tax cut sailed through the House on Thursday along party lines, the Senate Finance Committee was beset by sharp exchanges between Republicans and Democrats, who spent an arduous day trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to change a bill they said would favor corporations and the rich over everyone else.As midnight approached, Republicans on the usually collegial committee united to push an amended version of their tax overhaul toward the Senate floor, prompting an angry exchange between Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat, and Orrin Hatch, the committee chairman and Utah Republican, over who really benefits from the bill.\u201cThat whole thing about higher wages, well, it\u2019s a good selling point,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cJust spare us the bank shot, spare us the sarcasm, and the satire.\u201dMr. Hatch, who had wearily tolerated hours of debate on a bill that Republicans have always planned to push along party lines, had heard enough.\u201cI come from the poor people, and I\u2019ve been here working my whole stinking career for people who don\u2019t have a chance, and I really resent anybody saying I\u2019m just doing it for the rich,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me a break.\u201dA comparison of tax rates under the current law vs. the Senate tax bill\u2019s proposed changes.The exchange highlights the degree to which Democrats have found themselves outboxed in the most sweeping tax rewrite in generations. While Republicans in both chambers have allowed Democrats to offer amendments to the legislation, they have universally rejected those provisions. That has left Democrats with little recourse other than publicly pillorying the bill.Ahead of the House vote on Thursday, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader and California Democrat, accused Republicans of passing the bill in the cloak of darkness.\u201cWith straight faces and with the speed of light \u2014 I have to give them credit \u2014 they raced this thing through in the dark of night,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to sell a bill of goods to the middle class that this is in their interest, that this is a middle income tax cut.\u201d She added that \u201cRepublicans are raising taxes on 36 million middle-class families.\u201dThe exchange between the usually staid Mr. Hatch and the more fiery Mr. Brown appeared to awaken a hearing room in the Senate\u2019s Hart Building that had been overtaken by exhaustion after nearly 12 hours of talk about taxes.\u201cI get sick of the richest people in this country getting richer and richer and richer,\u201d Mr. Brown said.A furious Mr. Hatch then raised his gavel and slammed it against the dais nine times to silence the Ohio senator.\u201cWhat you\u2019ve said is not right,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cI come from the lower middle class originally, we didn\u2019t have anything, so don\u2019t spew that stuff on me.\u201dHe added: \u201cThis bull crap that you guys throw out there really gets old after a while.\u201dAn aide to Mr. Brown said that while he and Mr. Hatch did not get a chance to speak afterward, there was no personal animosity between the senators and described the exchange as \u201ca passionate argument about the policies in the bill.\u201dThe Senate now begins its Thanksgiving recess, during which Republican leaders will try to sell reluctant senators within their own party on the legislation so that they can have a successful vote in early December.Big differences still remain between the House and Senate bills, and at least four Republican senators have openly expressed trepidations about the bill over its potential impact on the national debt and whether it does enough to help the middle class.The late-night clash in the Finance Committee could foreshadow a coarser debate to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Health Care Changes, Insurers, Hospitals and Drugstores Team Up", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAetna also has new partnerships with large health systems that include hospitals and doctors\u2019 groups in Northern California and Virginia.\u201cThere\u2019s been a strong trend for health organizations to want to broaden their footprint, especially on the part of insurers to get more direct contact with the individual,\u201d said Dr. John W. Rowe, a former hospital and insurance executive who is a professor of health policy at Columbia University.While the companies promote these partnerships to employers and consumers as one-stop shopping, they could also put customers at a disadvantage by limiting their choices and increasing medical costs.Under these arrangements, people may not be able to see doctors outside the organization\u2019s own medical group. In addition, patients may worry that their doctor will decide not to order an expensive test to exact savings for the business partners \u2014 the insurer and the health organization. An in-house pharmacy benefit manager could direct customers to certain drugs because its manufacturer offers hefty rebates even if the medicine is more expensive or does not work as well as a competitor\u2019s.And the combined clout of the companies could push consumers\u2019 expenses higher.Employers that purchase coverage on behalf of their workers may also have difficulty determining how much they are paying for a given medicine or a particular service, said Edward A. Kaplan, a senior vice president at Segal Consulting. There\u2019s already a lack of transparency when it comes to drug prices, and employers may have even less information if the insurer and the pharmacy benefit manager are the same entity. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder for us to get behind the curtain,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said.Companies are actively looking for partners that will provide an entree into new businesses or a new supply of customers. CVS Health, which started as a drugstore chain, operates a large pharmacy benefit manager as well as walk-in clinics in its drugstores. By combining with Aetna, which covers about 22 million people, CVS would be able to direct members to its own mail-order and pharmacy business and to its walk-in clinics, located in its drugstores, for much of their care.\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the continued integration in health care,\u201d said Tom Robinson, a partner for Oliver Wyman, a consultant that estimated there have been about 200 partnerships created between insurers and large health groups in the last five years. By sharing in the profits or losses of these ventures, the parties say they work more closely to make sure a patient gets the right medicine or has access to a doctor at a nearby clinic instead of resorting to an emergency room.These partnerships can also represent a dramatic departure from the status quo. In many situations, an insurer and a hospital group would barely talk to each other outside a meeting every year or so to haggle over how much to pay for a knee replacement or an overnight hospital stay. The discussions rarely include how to better manage the care of a patient whose asthma goes untreated or has back pain that would be better treated with physical therapy.The contract negotiations between insurers and hospital systems tend to be \u201ca zero-sum game,\u201d said Brigitte Nettesheim, a senior executive with Aetna. Once the contract is signed, and a conflict arises over the cost or choice of a treatment, the patient is the one often caught in the middle.Aetna started offering joint plans with Inova, a large organization in Northern Virginia, in 2013. The partnership now covers more than 193,000 people. Patients see a doctor who belongs to a special network of primary-care physicians and specialists, most of whom are not employed by Inova but work together closely with the system to coordinate care for patients.Inova was able to finance the creation of this network through the joint venture, and it is now experimenting with new ways of paying the network\u2019s doctors so they bear more responsibility for the overall effectiveness of the care they deliver. If they save money by caring for the patient more efficiently, they share in the savings.Patients in these joint ventures are also assigned a nurse who helps them navigate the system. When a cardiologist prescribed a new cholesterol medicine that required a $200 co-payment, the nurse was able to call the doctor to find a less expensive alternative, saving the patient nearly $2,300 a year, Ms. Nettesheim said. \u201cIt\u2019s about these open lines of communication,\u201d she said.When Banner Health, a large group based in Phoenix, partnered with Aetna to offer a joint health plan, it decided to add 35 retail clinics where people could get care after-hours or closer to their homes rather than show up in the system\u2019s emergency rooms. The clinics \u201care lower-cost options for our members and more convenient,\u201d said Chuck Lehn, the president of the Banner Health Network.It\u2019s too soon to tell whether these new combinations will succeed in delivering on the promises made when they join forces. \u201cThey just tied the knot,\u201d Mr. Robinson of Oliver Wyman said. \u201cNow they have to build the relationship.\u201dFollow Reed Abelson on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Silicon Valley Plans to Conquer the Classroom", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEducation DisruptedBALTIMORE COUNTY, Md. \u2014 They call it the \u201cChurch Lane Hug.\u201dThat is how educators at Church Lane Elementary Technology, a public school here, describe the protective two-armed way they teach students to carry their school-issued laptops.And Silicon Valley has embraced the school district right back.Silicon Valley is going all out to own America\u2019s school computer-and-software market, projected to reach $21 billion in sales by 2020. An industry has grown up around courting public-school decision makers, and tech companies are using a sophisticated playbook to reach them, The New York Times has found in a review of thousands of pages of Baltimore County school documents and in interviews with dozens of school officials, researchers, teachers, tech executives and parents.School leaders have become so central to sales that a few private firms will now, for fees that can climb into the tens of thousands of dollars, arrange meetings for vendors with school officials, on some occasions paying superintendents as consultants. Tech-backed organizations have also flown superintendents to conferences at resorts. And school leaders have evangelized company products to other districts.Tech companies have not gone as far as drug companies, which have regularly paid doctors to give speeches. But industry practices, like flying school officials to speak at events and taking school leaders to steak and sushi restaurants, merit examination, some experts say.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be paid by Big Pharma, or Big Ed Tech, to be influenced,\u201d Dr. Boyd said. She has raised concerns about the tech initiative at school board meetings.In a district riven by disparities, Dallas Dance, the superintendent from 2012 through this past summer, made an appealing argument for a tech makeover. To help students develop new-economy skills, he said, every school must provide an equitable digital learning environment \u2014 including giving every student the same device.\u201cWhy does a first grader need to have it?\u201d Mr. Dance said in an interview last year. \u201cIn order to break the silos of equity, you\u2019ve got to say that everyone gets it.\u201dThe district wanted a device that would work both for youngsters who couldn\u2019t yet type and for high schoolers. In early 2014, it chose a particularly complex machine, an HP laptop that converts to a tablet. That device ranked third out of four devices the district considered, according to the district\u2019s hardware evaluation forms, which The Times obtained. Over all, the HP device scored 27 on a 46-point scale. A Dell device ranked first at 34.The district's hardware evaluations for HP, Dell, Apple and Lenovo devices. The winning device: HP.Mychael Dickerson, a school district spokesman, said, \u201cThe device chosen was the one that was closely aligned to what was recommended by stakeholders.\u201d Daly did not respond to inquiries.With the laptop deal sealed, Silicon Valley kicked into gear.In September 2014, shortly after the first schools received laptops, HP invited the superintendent to give a keynote speech at a major education conference in New York City. Soon after, Gus Schmedlen, HP\u2019s vice president for worldwide education, described the event at a school board meeting.\u201cWe had to pick one group, one group to present what was the best education technology plan in the world for the last academic year,\u201d Mr. Schmedlen said. \u201cAnd guess whose it was? Baltimore County Public Schools!\u201dAn HP spokesman said the company did not pay for the trip. He said the company does not provide \u201ccompensation, meals, travel or other perks to school administrators or any other public sector officials.\u201dRecently, parents and teachers have reported problems with the HP devices, including batteries falling out and keyboard tiles becoming detached. HP has discontinued the Elitebook Revolve.Mr. Dickerson, the district spokesman, said there was not \u201ca widespread issue with damaged devices.\u201dAn HP spokesman said: \u201cWhile the Revolve is no longer on the market, it would be factually inaccurate to suggest that\u2019s related to product quality.\u201dAsked what device would eventually replace the Revolve in the schools, the district said it was asking vendors for proposals.A Baltimore County school board member, David Uhlfelder, said a representative from the Office of the Maryland State Prosecutor had interviewed him in September about Mr. Dance\u2019s relationship with a former school vendor (a company not in the tech industry).The prosecutor\u2019s office declined to confirm or deny its interest in Mr. Dance.Mr. Dance, who discussed the district\u2019s tech initiatives with a Times reporter last year, did not respond to repeated emails and phone calls this week seeking comment.Mr. Dance\u2019s travel schedule sheds light on that world.Between March 2014, when the laptop contract was announced, and April 2017, when he announced his resignation, Mr. Dance took at least 65 out-of-state trips related to the district\u2019s tech initiatives or involving industry-funded groups, according to a Times analysis of travel documents obtained under public records laws \u2014 nearly two trips per month on average. Those trips cost more than $33,000. The Times counted only trips with local receipts, indicating Mr. Dance set foot in the cities.At least $13,000 of Mr. Dance\u2019s airline tickets, hotel bills, meals and other fees were paid for by organizations sponsored by tech companies, some of which were school vendors, The Times found. The $13,000 is an incomplete number, because some groups cover superintendents\u2019 costs directly, which means school records may not include them.Another way tech companies reach superintendents is to pay private businesses that set up conferences or small-group meetings with them. Superintendents nationwide have attended these events.ERDI offered several service levels this year, according to a membership rate card obtained by The Times. A $13,000 fee for Bronze membership entitles a company to one confidential meeting, where executives can meet with five school leaders to discuss products and school needs. Diamond members could pay $66,000 for six such meetings.The Education Research and Development Institute, known as ERDI, charges membership fees to school vendors to arrange small-group meetings with superintendents who can provide product feedback.\u201cBecause we are asking for their time and expertise, we commonly offer to pay the cost of their food, transportation and lodging during their participation,\u201d ERDI\u2019s president, David M.

He said Ms. White used vacation time to attend events, where she \u201cprovided guidance to education-related companies on goods, services and products that are in development to benefit student performance.\u201dAsked whether Ms. White had received ERDI payments, Mr. Dickerson said, \u201cParticipation in ERDI is done independently of the school system.\u201d In an email, Ms. White said she found ERDI to be a \u201cbeneficial professional learning experience.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond to a question about ERDI compensation.She added, \u201cI do not believe there are any conflicts of interests\u201d related to the district\u2019s tech initiative.Mr. Sundstrom, ERDI\u2019s president, said education companies pay a fee to attend events \u201cnot to meet school leaders or make a sale,\u201d but to get meaningful feedback on their education products from knowledgeable school leaders. He added that school officials do not make purchases at ERDI sessions and that it is their school boards that approve district purchases.Baltimore County\u2019s travel rules say, \u201cNo travel expenses will be paid by those seeking to do business with the Baltimore County Public Schools prior to obtaining a contract.\u201d Mr. Dickerson explained that applied to companies currently bidding for contracts.\u201cYou have these huge contracts, and then you donate all this money, and the foundation puts up a banner advertising your company\u2019s name,\u201d said Michael J.

Microsoft said its policies followed government gift and ethics rules. Pearson said its donation had been nominal and vetted to prevent conflict of interest. McGraw-Hill said it was committed to integrity and transparency.When asked if the foundation had policies governing donations from vendors or potential vendors, Ms. Phelps said no. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s not necessarily a policy,\u201d she said. There is also no policy prohibiting foundation board members who are vendors from reviewing grants involving their or competitors\u2019 products, she said.Mr. Dickerson said the focus of Baltimore County Public Schools was on \u201csupporting students, teachers and their learning environments.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are unapologetic for engaging with our Education Foundation, business partners and community stakeholders in an effort to close known achievement gaps.\u201dMr. Reich of Stanford suggested school districts establish clearer rules governing their relationships with vendors, particularly with tech companies racing to win over the gatekeepers to America\u2019s classrooms.

{"Headline": "Trump Administration Will Support Work Requirements for Medicaid", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Tuesday what it called \u201ca new day for Medicaid,\u201d telling state health officials that the federal government would be more receptive to work requirements and other conservative policy ideas to reshape the main government health program for low-income people.Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the administration would approve proposals from states to require work or community engagement for people who want to receive Medicaid. The Obama administration had turned down such proposals, saying they would not further the purposes of Medicaid, which are to promote health coverage and access to care.But in a half-hour speech to the National Association of Medicaid Directors, which represents state officials, Ms. Verma said on Tuesday that Medicaid had a higher purpose: to help people \u201crise out of poverty and government dependence.\u201dMany people on Medicaid, including many who became eligible as a result of the Affordable Care Act, are able-bodied adults of working age, Ms. Verma said.\u201cThese are individuals who are physically capable of being actively engaged in their communities, whether it be through working, volunteering, going to school or obtaining job training,\u201d Ms. Verma said. \u201cLet me be clear to everyone in this room: We will approve proposals that promote community engagement activities.\u201dShe heaped criticism on the Obama administration, saying it had focused on increasing Medicaid enrollment rather than helping people move out of poverty and into jobs.\u201cBelieving that community engagement requirements do not support or promote the objectives of Medicaid is a tragic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the prior administration,\u201d Ms. Verma said. \u201cThose days are over.\u201dJason A. Helgerson, the Medicaid director in New York State, said on Twitter that Ms. Verma\u2019s comments were \u201cabsolutely awful.\u201d It was absurd for her to suggest that she was ushering in a new day for Medicaid by taking it away from millions of people, he said.Ms. Verma worked for years as a consultant to state Medicaid officials. With her guidance, her home state of Indiana expanded Medicaid eligibility under the governor at the time, Mike Pence, while emphasizing \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d by requiring beneficiaries to pay premiums and contribute to health savings accounts.In her remarks on Tuesday, Ms. Verma did not renew Republican calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act. But she criticized the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, an option that has been taken up by 31 states.\u201cThe thought that a program designed for our most vulnerable citizens should be used as a vehicle to serve working age, able-bodied adults does not make sense,\u201d Ms. Verma said.Average monthly enrollment in Medicaid, according to the Congressional Budget Office, has climbed by nearly one-third, to 77 million people, since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\u201cCommunity engagement\u201d is a broad term that states define in various ways. It can include not only paid employment, but also volunteer activities, going to school, job training, searching for jobs, caring for elderly relatives and even treatment for drug or alcohol abuse.Donna Checkett, a former Medicaid director in Missouri, said Ms. Verma\u2019s position on requiring such activities was \u201c180 degrees different from that of the previous administration.\u201dCindy Mann, who was the top federal Medicaid official under Mr. Obama, said Ms. Verma\u2019s objections to Medicaid coverage of working age, able-bodied adults were \u201cupsetting and disturbing.\u201dThe Affordable Care Act gave states the \u201cflexibility and financing\u201d to cover that population in diverse ways, without seeking a federal waiver, Ms. Mann said.And she noted that the expansion of Medicaid had been defended by Republican governors including Chris Christie of New Jersey, John R. Kasich of Ohio, Rick Snyder of Michigan, Chris Sununu of New Hampshire and Brian Sandoval of Nevada.Ms. Verma also announced changes to speed the review of state requests for waivers of the federal Medicaid law. She said the Trump administration could approve some waivers for 10 years. Waivers have typically been approved for five years, with the possibility of an extension for three years.In addition, Ms. Verma said, \u201cif we approve an idea in one state and another state wants to do the same thing, we will expedite those approvals.\u201dShe said the Trump administration would issue a scorecard measuring and comparing states\u2019 performance in improving the health of people on Medicaid. The federal government and the states together spend more than $550 billion a year on Medicaid, and people deserve to know if the money is \u201cproducing positive results,\u201d she said.Matt D. Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said state officials agreed with Ms. Verma that they should focus on Medicaid beneficiaries and the outcomes of the care provided.But, Mr. Salo said, \u201cwe have a lot of disagreement\u201d with the contention that Medicaid should not be serving able-bodied adults of working age. State officials said that many Medicaid beneficiaries had low-wage jobs that did not provide health insurance for them or their family members.Ms. Verma insisted that the Affordable Care Act had given states perverse financial incentives, paying a higher share of Medicaid costs for newly eligible beneficiaries.\u201cThe A.C.A.,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201cmoved millions of working-age, nondisabled adults into a program that was created to care for seniors in need, pregnant mothers, children and people with disabilities, stretching the safety net for some of our most fragile populations, many of whom are still on waiting lists for critical home-care services while states enroll millions of newly eligible able-bodied adults.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}

Mr. Mugabe, who will be 94 next year, is running for re-election despite his increasingly frail health.Ms. O\u2019Donovan was arrested on Friday at her home in Harare and charged with subverting the government and undermining the authority of \u2014 or insulting \u2014 the president. She faces up to 20 years in prison.But on Thursday, a high court judge in Harare granted bail to Ms. O\u2019Donovan and openly expressed skepticism of the charges against her.The judge, Clement Phiri, said that Ms. O\u2019Donovan had \u201cshowed that she has a plausible defense.\u201d He added that \u201cit appears, prima facie,\u201d that there was no evidence of a plot \u201cto overthrow the government.\u201dShe has surrendered her passport and was ordered not to leave the country. A trial date has yet to be set.Ms. O\u2019Donovan, of Martinsville, N.J., is a 2014 graduate of New York University\u2019s Gallatin School of Individualized Study and is a project coordinator for Magamba Network, which produces political satire and comedy. She lives in Harare, the Zimbabwean capital.Prosecutors said that, starting in February, Ms. O\u2019Donovan had \u201csystematically sought to incite political unrest through the expansion, development and use of a sophisticated network of social media platforms as well as running some Twitter accounts.\u201dMs. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s goal, prosecutors charged, was to \u201creplicate offline uprisings like what happened in Tunisia and Egypt\u201d in 2011.The @matigary account \u2014 which has accumulated a wide following, including among Zimbabwean journalists, for incisive posts about Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government \u2014 has continued to tweet since Ms. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s arrest.A social media campaign started by the organization under the hashtag #FreeMartha urges Zimbabweans to call for her release, and is being spread by local and international rights groups.David McGuire, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Harare, said it was \u201cmonitoring Martha\u2019s case very closely and our Consular Services team has been in frequent, direct contact with Martha since her arrest.\u201dThe arrest came as Zimbabwe\u2019s government, which last month established a cybersecurity ministry, is tightening its control over social media and its potential threat to Mr. Mugabe\u2019s 37-year rule.The crackdown has helped keep the nation\u2019s streets quiet this year. But as Mr. Mugabe prepares to run for another term, Ms. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s arrest indicates that the authorities are unlikely to tolerate even the slightest criticism of the aging leader.In an apparent display of strength, Mr. Mugabe had the airport in Harare, the nation\u2019s biggest, renamed for him on Thursday.In September, government officials described social media as a security threat, after false rumors about shortages in the nation\u2019s supermarkets caused panic buying and a spike in prices.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s longtime finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, was appointed the new cybersecurity minister last month.

{"Headline": "The Clash of Social Visions", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery tax plan is a social vision and a statement of values. The social vision embedded in the House Republican tax plan is straightforward: to take money away from affluent professionals in blue states and to pump up corporations as the engine for broad economic growth.Or to put it more bluntly, Republicans think the whole country would be better off if we take money away from the Democrats\u2019 rich people and give it to their own (more productive) rich people.Second, the Republican plan cuts the deduction for state and local taxes. In 2014, according to The Economist, nearly 90 percent of the benefit from this deduction flowed to those making more than $100,000 a year. Once again, this tax hike hits mostly those in high-tax blue states.Third, the bill taxes investment income earned by private universities with at least 500 students and assets not directly tied to educational objectives of more than $100,000 per student. It imposes a 20 percent excise tax on nonprofit executives who make more than $1 million.This is the beginning of the full-bore Republican assault on the private universities, which are seen as the power centers of blue America \u2014 rich, money-hoarding institutions that widen inequality and house radical left-wing ideologies.Fourth, the bill preserves high top marginal tax rates on individual income and even raises rates in some cases on the very rich. Over the past few decades when Republicans have talked about tax reform, they have generally talked about sharply cutting the top marginal rate to 25 percent or even 15 percent. But this plan keeps the top rate at 39.6 percent. And then it throws in some peculiarities. As The Wall Street Journal noted, under the plan a married couple would face a 45.6 percent top rate on earnings between $1.2 million and $1.6 million.Republicans would take the revenue from these tax hikes (and much more) and they would use it to lighten the load borne by corporations.None of this is to say that the Republican plan is worth supporting. I personally oppose it because of the way it explodes the deficits. Second, the level of largess to corporate shareholders is frankly ridiculous. It piles one corporate tax cut on top of another like piling a chocolate sundae on top of chocolate cake on top of a Toblerone bar.This is not a column about the workability or advisability of this or that plan. This is a column about the sort of social vision that serves as a predicate for that plan.The Republicans have a social vision. The Republican vision is that the corporate sector is more important to a healthy America than the professional and nonprofit sector. The Republican vision is that companies that thrive in the red states, like manufacturing and agriculture, are more important for the country than the industries that thrive in blue states, like finance, media, the academy and the movies.What, by contrast, is the Democratic vision? Are Democrats going to spend the next few months defending the mortgage interest deduction and other tax breaks for their own rich?It could be that economic policy is becoming tribal just like everything else in our politics. In that world, parties use their time in power to nakedly shift the tax code for the benefit of their own donors.It would be nice if our tax code wasn\u2019t red or blue but distinguished between social goods and social bads. I\u2019d love to see a tax code that rewarded investment and discouraged consumption. That would mean cutting taxes on earnings but raising revenue through a progressive consumption tax. I\u2019d love to see a tax code that punished pollution but encouraged social cohesion. That would mean taxing carbon but increasing tax credits for working people and families with children.You may or may not like my vision, but it\u2019s more elevated than the visions that are now emerging, which are a dressed-up version of the spoils system: more money for my political friends and less for my political foes.Advertisement"}

Republicans desperately need to pass some kind of tax cuts, just to prove their majority is capable of doing something more exciting than renaming post offices. Voting starts this week, but now they\u2019ve really muddied up the game.People, if you were advising the Republicans on how to get a tax bill passed despite their infinitesimal majority in the Senate, would you suggest they:A) Get Roy Moore to endorse it.B) Add an assault on Obamacare.C) Get rid of the part where you raise taxes on teachers who buy supplies for their classes.\u201cHow about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further?\u201d Trump tweeted from Asia. The individual mandate is the part that requires everyone to have insurance. Without it, the whole system could fall apart.For a while, almost everybody ignored him. The only Republican senator who was really lobbying for a tax-bill assault on Obamacare seemed to be Rand Paul, who is now hobbled by injuries he suffered when a neighbor tackled him while he was mowing the grass.But here\u2019s the question. Why is the Senate choosing to totally complicate its tax-cut pitch, poisoning any possibility of bringing along moderate Democrats, by tossing in an all-out assault on the Affordable Care Act?A) Rand Paul made them do it.B) Trump told them: \u201cGet rid of Obamacare or the turkey dies.\u201dC) Republicans wanted more money for multinational corporations.That $330 billion, McConnell said, would allow them \u201cto make permanent the corporate tax rate\u201d and \u201cpuff up some of the middle-class tax relief that we would like to puff up.\u201dAll these changes happened so swiftly and silently, almost nobody could immediately figure out what was going on. \u201cWe learned about this latest version at 10:30 last night,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon on Wednesday. Wyden is the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. He asked for a summary of what the new, thick, deeply complicated bill would do. \u201cThey all looked at us and said, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d\u201cWhat is making you do this to us?\u201d cried another Democratic senator. Over in the House, Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas complained that the Ways and Means Committee had devoted \u201cless time to hearings on this bill than it takes to microwave popcorn.\u201dEverything\u2019s so frenetic it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s going on. The House Republicans, in a moment of large-heartedness, seem to have given up on the idea of killing a tax deduction for adoptions. Graduate students in work-study programs, however, had better keep their eyes open.And the chances that the whole package will keep the deficit from exploding are pretty minimal. Representative John Larson of Connecticut, one of the Democrats on the House tax-writing committee, says a Republican leader told him they would work everything out in the long run by cutting back on entitlements like Medicare. We are expecting to hear a lot more of that discussion in days to come.Really, Trump\u2019s staff probably went through a more careful process picking out a turkey for him to pardon. And we\u2019re looking forward to that already. Will he say anything to the turkey? Wait for the turkey to pay him a compliment? It\u2019s not as if he\u2019s much of a fan of non-red meats.Now steak is another matter. Do not ever expect Donald Trump to pardon a steer. Or lead a party.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are You First Gen? Depends on Who\u2019s Asking", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrying to help a high school senior get into his dream school, Laurie Kopp Weingarten called the college to emphasize that the boy should be able to lay claim to the latest, and fuzziest, of all admissions hooks: being a first-generation student.The student\u2019s mother had never enrolled in college; his father had a degree but had died when his son was a toddler. The student had grown up in a household with little money and where college had never been discussed. Surely, Ms. Weingarten assumed, the boy could be counted as a first-generation college applicant, deserving of an admissions bump for being disadvantaged.Whether used as code for \u201clow income\u201d or \u201cunderprivileged\u201d or as a proxy for affirmative action, the label comes with assumptions: that the student\u2019s parents have little or no experience navigating the academic, financial and cultural barriers to higher education, including an application process that stymies even the most savvy parent. Filling out financial aid forms can be a nightmare, especially when parents don\u2019t speak English, Ms. Weingarten said.\u201cFirst gen\u201d may be the latest buzz phrase in higher education but its import is not just academic. Colleges have always viewed their mission as promoting social mobility, but given rising income inequality and the skills needed to get high-paying jobs, they have intensified their efforts to enroll and lift disadvantaged students.They also try to make degrees more affordable. Both Bowdoin and Trinity colleges, for example, waive application fees for first-gen students; Pitzer College has a few endowed scholarships. The University of Wisconsin just began offering free tuition for first-gen transfer students, while Duke last year created one of the most generous, comprehensive programs of all. It will select 240 first gens to attend for free all four years; they will receive a computer, books and travel between semesters at no cost.Colleges can identify first gens on the Common Application, which asks for parents\u2019 education history. Along with the application, the organization sends a customized summary of candidates\u2019 attributes, including, since 2013-14, first-generation status. When this is combined with the entry that shows that the application fee was waived for financial reasons, it\u2019s apparent who is both low income and first gen. But the Common Application definition is different from the legislative one. It\u2019s the same as the one used by the engineering school that Ms. Weingarten called \u2014 neither parent can have a bachelor\u2019s, even if they didn\u2019t raise the child.It may seem like hairsplitting. But in the frenzied competition for admission to selective schools, where counselors have seen students get their DNA tested to see if they qualify as minorities, it\u2019s an important distinction. Several said they advise their first-gen clients to highlight their status, either in essays or interviews. When Ms. Weingarten meets new clients, one of her first questions concerns their parents\u2019 education level. \u201cThis process is so difficult, if you have an honest advantage, you should use it,\u201d she said.Certainly there are affluent parents who never went to college, punching holes in the idea that first gens are by definition disadvantaged. One college counselor told of a first-gen student on the East Coast who arrived at her counseling appointment in a Porsche. She wrapped herself in the first-gen mantle, bringing it up whenever she could and was admitted to several selective schools.Conceivably, one can be both first gen and legacy. One first-generation student in Minnesota is applying to her grandmother\u2019s alma mater. \u201cI definitely don\u2019t fit the stereotype for a first-generation student,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a middle-class white girl.\u201d Her mother owns a small business and her father works as a middle manager in information technology at a Fortune 500 company.To be sure, most first-generation students come from families with low incomes and minimal exposure to college. Only 12.5 percent of all students whose parents didn\u2019t get a bachelor\u2019s degree come from families with incomes exceeding $106,000, according to an analysis of federal data by Robert Kelchen, an assistant professor at Seton Hall University. Many education experts even use the terms \u201cfirst gen\u201d and \u201clow income\u201d interchangeably. Officials who practice \u201cholistic\u201d admissions \u2014 examining family background, recommendations and essays in addition to grades and test scores \u2014 say they can figure out who is truly disadvantaged by looking at how candidates overcome obstacles, whatever those may be.How much first-gen status really matters for college admissions is unclear. At Harvard, it\u2019s \u201cone of 50 factors\u201d under consideration, said William R. Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid. \u201cThis is not a mechanical process.\u201d Some counselors view it as a \u201ctipping factor\u201d for students who are tied with others in the admissions pool; others insist that it is much more important.\u201cIt\u2019s something that colleges love to brag about,\u201d said Brian Taylor, managing director of Ivy Coach, a New York counseling company, noting that many colleges list their first-gen statistics in their brochures.Many students turn to online communities like College Confidential and Reddit to question whether they fit the definition. One student, raised by his stepfather, wondered if he\u2019d be disqualified because his biological father had a degree; another student worried about her mother\u2019s online education from Kaplan University. A lively discussion followed a post by a student applying to Columbia who wanted to omit degrees her parents earned abroad.Colleges don\u2019t typically check information. But consultants urge their clients not to lie. Cyndy McDonald, a consultant in Visalia, Calif., encourages students to write essays about their first-generation backgrounds, even if they don\u2019t meet a college\u2019s definition.\u201cThese students have unique experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the legacy card to drop.\u201dThe most disadvantaged students don\u2019t usually write essays about those experiences, Mr. Fitzsimmons said. They may think their backgrounds would be held against them or they may not even have heard of the first-gen label. Some assume they don\u2019t qualify because they have siblings who have gone to college.Anthony A. Jack, a Harvard education professor who researches the experiences of lower-income students, said a student once asked if he could join a support group even though his father had a master\u2019s degree. The boy had been raised by extended family who had not gone to college, and the father, who had an arrest record, had not been part of his son\u2019s life. \u201cThat\u2019s not a parental influence,\u201d Dr. Jack said.Some support groups and scholarship organizations define the term broadly to be more inclusive. To underscore economic issues, the University of Pennsylvania has created an F.G.L.I. program for \u201cfirst-generation and/or low-income students.\u201d Brown opened its First-Generation College and Low-Income Student Center last year.The Institute for Higher Education Policy last year released a report, financed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, similarly calling for the definition to be narrowed so that students whose parents had an associate degree could no longer be counted as first gen.The institute\u2019s analysis of education statistics helps explain its reasoning. If students who attended a four-year college had parents with no education after high school, only 50 percent graduated within six years. If at least one parent had some college but no degree, the graduation rate was 57 percent. But if at least one parent had an associate degree or higher, the rate jumped to 72 percent.Dr. Jack, who is serving on an American Sociological Association task force to tackle the issue, says he wants to focus on how people use the term. It evokes images of a Horatio Alger character striving for success, he said, which is far better than language that stigmatizes students for being at risk. For some people, \u201cthis is affirmative action that won\u2019t ruffle any feathers. It\u2019s more palatable.\u201d But, he said, supporting first-generation students is no substitute for admissions that considers race.To figure out what first generation really means, he said, it\u2019s important to step back and examine the goals of higher education. \u201cWhat,\u201d he asked, \u201care we trying to do with the definition?\u201dRochelle Sharpe is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter based in Boston who writes often on health and education.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what to watch for.The overarching task is the same as ever: figuring out how to limit severe global warming in the decades ahead.Two years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, the world remains far off course from preventing drastic global warming in the decades ahead.Developing countries have also argued that they need financial aid from wealthier nations to expand clean energy and adapt to the ravages of climate change.Conversely, it\u2019s entirely possible that the Trump administration\u2019s rejection of the Paris deal could lead other countries to disengage from global efforts to address climate change. Or the talks could get bogged down by the traditional rifts between richer and poorer nations. That, in turn, could stall momentum right before the next big round of climate talks in 2018 \u2014 when countries are supposed to get down to the details of what\u2019s needed to step up their climate policies going forward.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

(\u201cOur podcast friends could fill that stadium.\u201d)Maybe he wasn\u2019t kidding.Primero y Diez began as a blog in 2008, run by Harada and a friend, and has mushroomed into four podcasts, with a paid staff of 12 and, it says, 1.5 million visits to its programs monthly during the football season.Primero y Diez has grown in sync with Mexican interest in the N.F.L., accelerated by the regular-season game here last season \u2014 the first in Mexico City in 11 years \u2014 and by a matchup Sunday between the New England Patriots and Oakland Raiders at the city\u2019s famed Estadio Azteca, with another game planned for next year.The leagues are finding that these big events carry a cachet that Mexicans, regardless of their level of interest in the sport, are willing to pay for.\u201cThere is a social effect, and one of not wanting to miss the big event in the city,\u201d said Rodrigo Latorre, an independent sports marketing analyst. \u201cIn that regard, a lot of attendance is guaranteed.\u201dBoth N.F.L. games, in a stadium with a capacity of 72,000 for American football, sold out in less than an hour. The average price was $95.On Primero y Diez programs, the complicated discussions and debate that occur in the United States \u2014 over concussions, domestic violence, racial protests by players and whether the sport is in decline \u2014 take a back seat to full-throated dissections of Philip Rivers\u2019s floating passes, and Blake Bortles\u2019s interceptions, and whether the Rams \u201ccan play with the big boys of the N.F.C.\u201d\u201cHere in Mexico they like sports, but they don\u2019t like to talk about what surrounds sports,\u201d said Harada, 32, who worked in public relations and sports journalism before beginning the site to satisfy his own demand for saturated N.F.L. news and commentary.\u201cPeople were looking for information to place their bets,\u201d said Andres Ornelas, 34, who does a betting podcast for the site. \u201cThey said it\u2019s how they pay their rent.\u201dA loose vibe prevails in the cramped, rented booth where the podcasts are recorded. A cardboard cutout of Raiders quarterback Derek Carr loomed over the hosts last week, and during one taping they sipped cold beer while riffing on the weekend\u2019s games.\u201cThere is great quality in their content with a lot of different elements that give great, additional value,\u201d said Eric Arriaga, a 34-year-old government lawyer who follows the podcasts. \u201cAll their work is unique and original.\u201dThe N.F.L. is betting on a future of long-term economic growth in Mexico to expand the middle class and lure more sponsors; further develop a growing fan base (the league\u2019s surveys put it at upward of 10 million self-described hard-core fans); and increase sales of merchandise, as well as television and media rights.In a typical week, nine games are aired in Mexico City, two on broadcast television and the others on cable \u2014 in some cases more than what is available in most American cities. As in the United States, ratings have slipped \u201cin the single digits,\u201d said Arturo Olive, the N.F.L.\u2019s point person in Mexico.Most analysts believe that security and logistical hurdles make putting a permanent team here largely a fantasy. The city\u2019s smog and elevation of about 7,500 feet are enough of a challenge that extra oxygen tanks will be on hand for the players this weekend.But the league reaps benefits in business deals around the visits. Olive said the game on Sunday would turn a profit for the league, but he declined to elaborate.The N.F.L. decided to resume regular-season games here after Estadio Azteca, a showcase venue for soccer, was remodeled last year for its 50th anniversary, adding two locker rooms suitable for professional football teams and internet and communications upgrades expressly to lure back the N.F.L.The Patriots and the Raiders are two of the most popular teams in Mexico. The Cowboys and the Steelers lead the pack, since their games were the first to be broadcast in the country in the 1970s. When fans are encountered here, they tend to be rabid about the sport.\u201cWhat I would tell you is the level of knowledge that fans have of the game, the Xs and Os, the sophistication, is as strong as it is in the U.S.,\u201d said Mark Waller, the N.F.L.\u2019s chief international executive. \u201cWhen you become the fan of a sport in another country, almost by definition you become more knowledgeable because you have to force yourself to learn it.\u201dThe young men behind Primero y Diez exemplify that.Their site is housed in an incubator for tech start-ups in a hip neighborhood, buzzing with well-educated 20- and 30-somethings like themselves.Jorge Tinajero, 41, a computer engineer who is another founder of the site, traces his passion for the sport to a family tradition of football, in his case a father who played at a college in Mexico.Tinajero played touch football as a boy and remembers getting hooked for good while watching John Elway in the Super Bowl against the Giants.\u201cAnd then I started suffering every two or three years like die-hard Broncos fans,\u201d he said.Carlos Gorozpe, 31, a social network and website consultant and a commentator on Primero y Diez, said he had never caught the soccer bug, instead inheriting a fondness for the Buffalo Bills from an uncle mad about the team and about college football here and in the United States.\u201cAs a kid, I woke up to watch bowl games,\u201d he said.Primero y Diez receives news media credentials from the N.F.L. \u2014 and Harada writes occasional pieces in Spanish for the Steelers\u2019 website \u2014 but it otherwise is not affiliated with the league, which Harada said he preferred.\u201cI like the idea of independence, I have so many ideas,\u201d he said.This week, Primero y Diez has been in its element. It has published a magazine on the Patriots-Raiders game, filled with statistical breakdowns, player snapshots, a history of the stadium. And it was planning live shows on Facebook in the days leading up to the game.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the Raiders are going to do to deter the offense of the Patriots,\u201d Tinajero said.Harada settled on a prediction: Raiders over the Patriots, 31-28.It surely did not come out of thin air.Ken Belson contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Upscale Hamlet Weighs Whether to Be a Village (or Not to Be)", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGREENBURGH, N.Y. \u2014 Along the handsome byways of Edgemont, a small sea of blue-and-white political signs dot the front lawns, highlighting a heated issue that will not even be decided this Election Day.That has led to an unexpectedly pitched battle between those who favor incorporation and officials in the Town of Greenburgh, a down-and-dirty fight featuring private investigators, accusations of greed and, naturally, a lawsuit.But separatists say they are not getting their money\u2019s worth; indeed, while they insist they are not motivated by money, the arc of the conflict bends that way.A recent tax reassessment in Greenburgh pushed the assessed values of Edgemont homes up by about 4 percent, effectively raising Edgemont\u2019s share of Greenburgh\u2019s taxes to 26 percent from 24 percent \u2014 even though Edgemont makes up just 17 percent of the unincorporated area\u2019s population.If Edgemont\u2019s 7,500 residents were removed from Greenburgh\u2019s tax rolls, that could undermine the town\u2019s finances, Greenburgh officials say. Edgemont\u2019s median household income is $201,000, higher than that of the six existing villages in town.Paul J. Feiner, the Greenburgh town supervisor for more than 25 years, said services in the rest of unincorporated Greenburgh would suffer if Edgemont became a village. The town, he said, stands to lose about $17 million in tax revenue. He predicted that homeowners in a new village of Edgemont would see their property taxes rise as well.\u201cPeople in Edgemont love the services they receive, and they are going to mess it up for everybody, including themselves,\u201d said Mr. Feiner, a Democrat, who is running unopposed on Tuesday. \u201cThey may not like me, but they are going to make a decision that will last for many decades after I\u2019m town supervisor. It\u2019s really for spite that they will destroy the town.\u201dThose who favor incorporation say the primary goal is not to save money on taxes. Rather, they want to gain control of land use, planning and budgeting decisions. Separatists also point out that with just 8 percent of Greenburgh\u2019s overall population, they are poorly positioned to effect political change in the town.\u201cThe town government does not really follow a process for governing, and they ignore the law when it\u2019s convenient,\u201d said Jeffrey Sherwin, an entrepreneur and father of two who is helping to lead the campaign here. \u201cThe solution provided by New York State is if you\u2019re unhappy, you too can become a village.\u201dIn February, petitions containing the signatures of Edgemont residents who want to form a village were submitted to the Town of Greenburgh; if accepted, voters in the proposed village would decide whether to incorporate in a referendum. But in May, Mr. Feiner rejected the petitions, citing discrepancies in the boundaries of the proposed village. (Village advocates say it would mirror the borders of a local fire district and closely resemble those of the school district.)Mr. Feiner also questioned the validity of some of the signatures and the total number needed; state law requires signatures from 20 percent of eligible voters in the proposed village.What seemed to antagonize Edgemont residents the most, however, was something Mr. Feiner did after the petition was submitted. Private investigators were sent to the homes of people who signed the petition, ostensibly to verify information. But those residents were asked to sign affidavits saying they had not been fully informed about the incorporation plan and that they rescinded their signatures.Mr. Feiner said the intention was simply to assure that the incorporation petition was valid, adding that he regretted \u201cthat we didn\u2019t speak to the investigators and have a dry run.\u201dThis year, the Edgemont Incorporation Committee commissioned a feasibility study for a new village. The study found that residents could maintain the same level of services by spending the same amount on taxes, and it projected that the village would run a surplus of $2.2 million by 2019.Jon Lewis, an Edgemont resident who works in municipal finance, said a number of services, including schools, fire protection, water and sewer, would not be affected by incorporation. In addition, the new village could explore sharing services with the neighboring village of Ardsley and also offer to buy back services from Greenburgh. \u201cWe are not picking up 7,500 people and moving to a rural area,\u201d he said.If the effort succeeds, Edgemont would become Greenburgh\u2019s seventh village. The other villages in the town \u2014 all incorporated between 1872 and 1910 \u2014 are Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry, Elmsford, Irvington, Hastings-on-Hudson and Tarrytown. Each village has its own mayor and board of trustees, with separate police departments and municipal employees overseeing services like public works and recreation.One development proposal that has inflamed some in the Edgemont community centers on an assisted living complex where a plant nursery now stands. A town ordinance requires that such a residence be within 200 feet of a county or state road, but the proposed location is more than 6,000 feet from such a roadway. The town\u2019s zoning board issued a variance anyway.\u201cThe law was there for a reason,\u201d said Mr. Sherwin, who lives near the proposed senior housing and worries about a potential surge in emergency calls there.Some town officials believe that complaints about legal settlements and development plans mask a pecuniary motivation on the part of some Edgemont residents.\u201cYou have a wealthier area of the town and they don\u2019t want to pay for services in the lower-income sections of the town,\u201d said Mr. Feiner, referring to after-school programs. \u201cWe have enormous services and what I hear on street is, \u2018Why should I pay for something I\u2019m not using?\u2019\u201dIn Albany, state lawmakers also tried to slow the incorporation effort. In June, Assemblyman Thomas J. Abinanti, a Democrat, introduced a bill, which applied only to Greenburgh, requiring approval by the town board before a referendum on incorporation could proceed. The bill died in committee, but Mr. Abinanti plans to revive it next year with a statewide focus.\u201cPolicy disagreements should not for the basis for a new government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be based on the need for services.\u201d\u201cThey will have the best financial shot,\u201d said Andy Crosby, an assistant professor of public administration at Pace University. \u201cIf you have a very large base for your property taxes, you don\u2019t need the tax rate to be very high to achieve what you want.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medicaid Is Great, but Rural Maine Needs Hospitals, Too", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHowever, Maine and other rural states face a health care crisis that Medicaid expansion can\u2019t fix on its own. It\u2019s not about affordable coverage; it\u2019s about access: For too many rural areas, doctors and hospitals are scarce.If closings continue at this rate, 25 percent of America\u2019s rural hospitals will have disappeared in the decade after Obamacare\u2019s passage. This does not take into account facility deterioration, doctor departures or department closures.Medicaid expansion is a welcome source of new revenue to rural hospitals in Maine because more insured patients mean fewer uncompensated treatments. Still, it comes nowhere close to fixing the problem or, politically, putting any meaningful points on the Democratic scoreboard.It still doesn\u2019t solve the heart of the rural problem. Democrats can\u2019t just lower premiums and expand Medicaid. We must strengthen rural communities by making access to high-quality health care services a priority of any proposal. In any future legislation, we should demand grants for new hospitals, funds to modernize crumbling ones and financial incentives for top doctors to work in these areas. This will not only make rural communities healthier, but also more welcoming for growth and new business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From City Hall to the White House? Eric Garcetti May Try to Defy the Odds", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 There have been governors and generals, senators and members of Congress, secretaries of state and vice presidents. There was even a billionaire business executive chosen as commander in chief.But never in the 228 years since Gen. George Washington was sworn in as president has a sitting mayor been elected to the White House.Eric M. Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, may be out to change that.The odds are long: Mr. Garcetti was sworn into his second term as mayor just five months ago, and has not built a particularly broad record of accomplishments to showcase to the nation.And in the course of an hourlong interview in his office, Mr. Garcetti, 46, a Democrat, made clear that, as unlikely as it might sound, he is considering a run for president, after announcing he would not run for governor. \u201cThere are 23 states that have a population smaller than Los Angeles,\u201d he said.Mr. Garcetti\u2019s attempt to test these waters \u2014 and the fact that he is being watched with some seriousness despite never running a national or even statewide campaign before \u2014 may say less about this city\u2019s mayor and more about the national political landscape.The success of President Trump, a business executive who had never run for office before, appears to have lowered the bar on the qualifications needed to run for the White House. And the Democratic Party is grappling with a sparse bench of candidates \u2014 many of its brightest prospects are in their 70s, like Joe Biden, the former vice president, or are relatively young and little known, like Mr. Garcetti.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy at all,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director under President Barack Obama. \u201cThe traditional definitions of electability have been turned on their heads. The skills that get someone through a presidential campaign are no longer r\u00e9sum\u00e9-based. Obama had served two years in the Senate when he started running for president.\u201dMike Murphy, a Republican adviser to the presidential campaigns of Senator John McCain of Arizona and Jeb Bush, compared Mr. Garcetti to Jimmy Carter, little-known as a first-term governor from Georgia who ran as an outsider against Washington after Watergate.\u201cIt\u2019s audacious, but it\u2019s not insane,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cHe\u2019s good on his feet. Generational. He\u2019s got a story: West Coast, the future.\u201dMr. Garcetti arrived at the interview loaded with statistics and sound bites, as he offered himself as a member of \u201can impatient next generation\u201d ready to lead a Democratic Party that he described as being as weak as he could remember.\u201cThe classic rules of American politics are dying if not dead, if you look at the last two presidential elections,\u201d Mr. Garcetti said. \u201cAn African-American could never be president until one was, a TV reality star couldn\u2019t become president until one was.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an impatient next generation ready to move,\u201d he said.Mr. Garcetti won re-election with 81 percent of the vote in March, in a race where he did not face strong opposition. Before he became mayor, he served for 12 years on the City Council.His background reflects the rich texture of the city that he governs and where he was raised. He is both Jewish and Mexican. His father, Gil Garcetti, is a two-term district attorney who prosecuted O. J. Simpson in the double-murder trial that ended in acquittal.The elder Mr. Garcetti has been seen hanging around his son\u2019s office \u2014 which, at the mayor\u2019s instruction, has no desk, and is decorated with art by California painters, on loan from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The mayor plays the piano, and a stand-up piano rests against a wall of his office.Despite broad support, Mr. Garcetti has been criticized for being painstakingly cautious, in contrast to the last mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, who constantly was throwing out ambitious \u2014 and sometimes criticized as too ambitious \u2014 ideas: planting a million trees, or taking over the school board. (That said, he succeeded in pushing through a major expansion in the region\u2019s transit system.) Mr. Garcetti may end up looking more attractive in places like New Hampshire than Los Angeles.\u201cThe mayor running for president?\u201d Eli Broad, a philanthropic and civic leader, said archly. \u201cHe\u2019s showing quite some ambition.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s stayed away from many controversial issues,\u201d Mr. Broad said. \u201cPensions. Education reform. He\u2019s done a lot of other good things for the city. But he\u2019s not Mike Bloomberg.\u201dMr. Murphy, the Republican adviser, who lives in Los Angeles, said while Mr. Garcetti\u2019s bearing and biography would win him a burst of early attention, he may not have the record to carry him through a competitive primary.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have an ideological profile,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cHe can\u2019t brag about having done much of anything in Los Angeles. The reputation he has among California pols is as a showhorse, not a workhorse.\u201dHomelessness in the city has reached alarming levels, with clusters of tents showing up in neighborhoods and business districts. Crime here, as in many cities, is on the rise. The city\u2019s finances have benefited from the economic rebound of the last few years, but the budget faces shortfalls in the years ahead.\u201cThe White House is not where power comes from in this country,\u201d Mr. Garcetti said. \u201cThe cities and the local communities of this nation are prepared to save Washington \u2014 and not vice versa.\u201dMr. Garcetti said he was \u201cproud to be a Democrat \u2014 but I don\u2019t walk around with a \u2018D\u2019 on my forehead. I\u2019m progressive and I\u2019m practical.\u201dIn Los Angeles, Mr. Garcetti backed raising the minimum wage and reducing business taxes. In the interview, he said he supported a national single-payer health care program, but was not ready to endorse another big priority of some party activists \u2014 impeaching Mr. Trump.California is not exactly viewed as representing mainstream American political thought these days, though Mr. Garcetti said he did not view that as a hindrance. \u201cI don\u2019t buy the idea that cities \u2014 or where I am geographically \u2014 are some sort of outlier.\u201dMr. Pfeiffer, who worked with Mr. Obama from his days as a presidential candidate, called Mr. Garcetti \u201ca very talented politician.\u201d\u201cHe comes across as authentic, which is incredibly important,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s cool, and I think there\u2019s a cool factor that is very important in a social media age.\u201dBut Joel Benenson, who was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and served as Mr. Obama\u2019s pollster, said the biggest thing Mr. Garcetti had going for him was the unsettled political field.\u201cI think it\u2019s a big jump,\u201d Mr. Benenson said of running for president. \u201cWhen Barack Obama spoke at the Democratic convention in 2004, a whole lot of people said, \u2018This guy is going to be president one day.\u2019 It might not have been 2008, but they saw it. I don\u2019t know if Eric Garcetti has that \u2014 I hate to use the phrase \u2014 star quality.\u201dAnd the mayor is not the only relatively inexperienced Democrat being mentioned: There are also Senator Kamala Harris of California, Gov.

{"Headline": "How Facebook\u2019s Oracular Algorithm Determines the Fates of Start-Ups", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "FeatureThe platform is so good at \u201cmicrotargeting\u201d that many small e-commerce companies barely even bother advertising anywhere else.Supported byOne night in the summer of 2015, over Sichuan at Han Dynasty on 85th Street, Cogan asked Horwitz for advice about his latest notion: selling contact lenses online. The contacts business was dominated by a handful of companies like Johnson & Johnson and Bausch & Lomb, which seemed to charge whatever they wanted \u2014 at least in Cogan\u2019s view, based on the price increases for his own lenses. Surely a low-cost competitor could tempt away customers. Cogan pulled his laptop from his bag and opened it at the table in the middle of dinner, pushing aside plates of dumplings and scallion pancakes. He had two plans to show Horwitz. They could sell a cheap disposable lens to doctors. Or they could mimic Cogan\u2019s employer, a wildly successful start-up called Harry\u2019s.By late 2015, Harry\u2019s, which sold safety razors and shaving cream, was in the vanguard of upstart online retailers known as direct-to-consumer companies. The business model works like this: Firms sell only their own products, only through their own websites. By cutting out retailers and distributors, they can charge less for their specialty products than entrenched competitors. That year, Casper, then a direct-to-consumer mattress and bedding seller, was reported to be on track to exceed $100 million in sales in its second year of business. Dollar Shave Club, another seller of razors, had reached $152 million in revenue. Warby Parker, the eyeglasses purveyor that many credit with pioneering this business model in 2010, had recently closed an investment round that reportedly valued the company at $1.2 billion. Venture capitalists \u2014 convinced that consumers would increasingly patronize specialty online retailers as they grew more comfortable shopping online \u2014 were pouring money into direct-to-consumer start-ups, more than $2 billion over the past four years, according to CB Insights.Horwitz, by now bored in his job, pushed Cogan to keep pursuing his idea and volunteered to help him do research. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to intellectualize whether an idea is good or not,\u201d Horwitz says. \u201cYou have to just start doing it and see.\u201dBy February 2016, after many nights and weekends of emailing Asian manufacturers and reading up on Food and Drug Administration compliance, the vision of a viable business was coming into focus. The pair had found an F.D.A.-approved manufacturer in Asia and figured out how to meet the necessary regulations. Still, Cogan was reluctant. He had been accepted to Wharton and had even put down a deposit. He believed that was the smarter option. At best, the contact-lens business would become a side project.Before shelving their venture, they decided to try one more tack. They recruited two friends: Paul Rodgers, a buddy of Horwitz\u2019s from Columbia who knew how to write computer code, and Dan Rosen, a friend of Cogan\u2019s from Bronx Science who was handy with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Together the four built what is known in the world of online retailing as a demand experiment. The technique, credited to Harry\u2019s founders (who give away its basic code), amounts to a two-page website. The first page explained the concept of a monthly subscription for contacts and asked those who were interested to submit their email addresses. Visitors who did so were taken to a second page and were made an offer: Share this referral code with friends, and if enough of them sign up, you\u2019ll get free contacts.They posted a link to their site on the walls of about 40 Facebook friends. Within a few days, not only had their own friends signed up, but friends of friends of friends had, too \u2014 some 2,000 people in all. Some of those distant connections were even evangelizing the company on their own Facebook walls. \u201cIt went mini-viral,\u201d Cogan says.He and Horwitz applied to tech incubators \u2014 organizations that invest in and coach young companies in exchange for minority stakes \u2014 using the demand experiment as one slide in their 16-page PowerPoint presentation. They pitched a few venture capitalists based in New York as well. They decided that if they were admitted to an incubator, they would work on the project full time. If not, Cogan would go to Wharton. By April, they had not only been called back for interviews with five incubators; venture funds were also offering to invest a total of $3.5 million in their idea.Cogan dropped his Wharton plans. He and Horwitz ordered 50,000 contact lenses and, with Rosen as creative director and Rodgers as chief technology officer, began working out of their investors\u2019 offices, stacking boxes and boxes of lenses along the walls by their desks. They eventually named their enterprise Hubble, after the orbiting telescope that can see into deep space.Facebook helped them succeed with their demand test; now it would generate their first sales. During the summer of 2016, a friend of one of Hubble\u2019s prospective investors, a start-up veteran named Joshua Liberson, recommended that the founders try a new type of Facebook advertising called Lead Ads. No outside website was needed: Would-be customers simply clicked a button on the ad to submit their email addresses, directly from Facebook. Hubble directed its ads to ZIP codes in New York and Chicago, where they had already signed up optometrists willing to write prescriptions. After people clicked the ads, Horwitz emailed them to coordinate appointments and take their orders.When Hubble\u2019s online store opened officially on Nov. 1, 2016, Cogan and Horwitz knew how to run a Facebook advertising campaign, and they were confident it would continue to generate sales. They planned to spend the additional $3.7 million they raised almost entirely on Facebook ads.In considering Facebook\u2019s far-reaching influence, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind the perspective of the more than five million advertisers whose money is financing the social network\u2019s rampant growth. For them, Facebook and Instagram, which the company also owns, are the stuff of fantasy \u2014 grand bazaars on a scale never seen before. By advertising directly in users\u2019 news feeds, companies can, at any time of day, target potential customers at moments when they are often bored and open to novelty. What better time to hear a product pitch?\u201cFacebook created the world\u2019s greatest infomercial,\u201d says Roger McNamee, a founder of Elevation Partners, who invested early in Facebook but has since become critical of the company\u2019s influence. \u201cIt\u2019s really inexpensive to produce ads and unbelievably inexpensive to reach exactly the market that you\u2019re looking for.\u201d As a result, Facebook has become especially lucrative for companies trying to sell new products online. The leaders of more than half a dozen new online retailers all told me they spent the greatest portion of their ad money on Facebook and Instagram.\u201cIn the start-up-industrial complex, it\u2019s like a systematic transfer of money\u201d from venture-capital firms to start-ups to Facebook, says Charlie Mulligan, the founder of BrewPublik, which uses a \u201cBeergorithm\u201d to deliver personalized selections of craft beers to customers every month. At 500 Startups, the tech incubator based in Silicon Valley that funded BrewPublik, Facebook advertising is a topic covered in classes. In fact, social-network advertising is an assumed prerequisite for anyone studying marketing at a tech incubator these days \u2014 or at any business school across the country. \u201cThere is a formula for this stuff,\u201d Mulligan says. \u201cAnd the reason why there is a formula is because it works.\u201dThe process is easy, cheap and effective. With a few hundred dollars and a morning\u2019s effort, an entrepreneur can place his or her ads before social-media users that same afternoon. Companies unsure which ads are best can upload a handful of them and let Facebook\u2019s artificial-intelligence software test their efficacy. If they don\u2019t know who should see their ads, they can embed code on their websites that enables Facebook to monitor the traffic and then show ads to recent visitors. Or companies can send the email addresses of their existing customers to Facebook, and it will locate their Facebook accounts and put ads in front of so-called Lookalikes, users who like and click on the same things that your proven fan base does. It\u2019s all about as straightforward as setting up an online dating profile. Steph Korey, a founder of Away, a luggage company based in New York that opened in 2015, says that when the company was starting, it made $5 for every $1 it spent on Facebook Lookalike ads.The ease of opening a business on Facebook has in turn spawned a wild proliferation of specialty digital sellers that depend on the social network\u2019s algorithm to find their early customers. Many of them follow the same playbook and even share a similar aesthetic. They spend money on traditional public relations, on sponsored links that appear next to Google search results and on \u201cinfluencer\u201d marketing, or giving away their product to people with large social-media followings, in hopes of creating buzz. Then they buy ads on Facebook and Instagram. Inevitably you will encounter them there: They feature a sleek photograph or a video loop of a product \u2014 a wood-handled water filter, woolen shoes, an electric toothbrush. At the top, in bold, the company\u2019s name appears, often ringing with the same friendly, typically two-syllable whimsy. Soma. Allbirds. Goby.\u201cSometimes we\u2019ll look at each other and say, \u2018God, there are just so many of them,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Ellie Wheeler, a partner at the venture fund Greycroft Partners, which invested in Hubble last year. Her firm has also taken ownership stakes in Thrive Market, which sells health foods; Plated, a meal-kit delivery service; Trunk Club, which mails a box of clothes to its customers; and Eloquii, a fast-fashion retailer specializing in plus sizes.While not all of these companies and others like them will survive, plenty are encroaching on established brands, which are taking the threat seriously. In July 2016, Unilever, the European consumer-products conglomerate, acquired Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1 billion. In June, Walmart agreed to buy Bonobos, an internet-based apparel brand, for $310 million. Companies that sell products exclusively online continue to grow faster than any other type of retailer in the United States \u2014 some 17 percent annually since 2011, more than six times the rate of retail over all, according to Euromonitor International.And Facebook has even been taking steps to influence offline sales, in order to bring traditional retailers into its orbit. In September, the social network introduced a tool that lets businesses with physical stores show ads to shoppers and their Lookalikes even if they visit the store but don\u2019t buy anything. Day by day, Facebook is extending its reach further and further into the American marketplace.The basic building block of Facebook advertising is an ad set. It consists of the ads themselves and choices in three other categories: audience, goal and budget. That day, Rosen was designing a set to reach an audience of people on Instagram who had visited hubblecontacts.com in the past 30 days. His goal was \u201cconversions,\u201d or persuading users who had seen the company\u2019s ad to make a purchase. Finally, he set a budget of $1,000 per day. He uploaded the three images. Now they were ready to be tested, to see if any of them were winners in the eyes of users and the algorithm.This detailed handicapping process involves thousands of advertisers per auction. Millions of auctions take place every minute as users across Facebook load their feeds. The process is never the same twice. The algorithm is constantly learning, using past results to inform how it weighs bids in the next auction. The intent, Facebook says, is to maximize value for everybody: to pair the advertiser with its likeliest customers, and to show ads that users want to see. And, of course, to make money for Facebook.But from Rosen\u2019s perspective, nothing much had happened before he ambled into the office a little after 10 a.m. Facebook had spent a grand total of $1.86 on his ads. It had shown the first ad to 51 people, the second to 45 and the third to only two. The first ad had been clicked once. Rosen, unperturbed, poured himself a cup of coffee from the single-serve machine. The algorithm takes a little while to get warmed up, he said. \u201cIn an hour, it\u2019ll get exciting.\u201dTwenty minutes later, Rosen refreshed his browser. The Ads Manager window displayed the latest numbers: Rosen could see only the results, not the process that produced them, but it seemed as if the click had inspired the algorithm to favor the first ad. During those 20 minutes, the first ad appeared before 76 more people \u2014 that is, it won 76 more auctions than the other two ads. Over the next hour, the algorithm showed the first ad, which featured a photo of colorful Hubble boxes against a blue background, to more and more users; the algorithm had begun to favor it, apparently. As Rosen refreshed his browser, the sensation was like watching a seed sprout. The ad got more views. Some led to clicks. And eventually, sometime between 11:28 a.m. and 11:53 a.m., one of those clicks led to the test\u2019s first sale. Commerce was in bloom.The moment felt odd. Obviously there was science behind the scenes; the algorithm was a set of rules written by Facebook engineers. But from where Rosen sat, the operation might as well have been run by the Holy Spirit. Facebook\u2019s artificial-intelligence algorithm had wound its way through the server farms, reached out among two billion users, found an individual and showed her a Hubble ad on Instagram \u2014 and she used her credit card to buy a subscription for contact lenses.In quick succession, the first ad generated two more sales. The algorithm started increasing how much it bid on Hubble\u2019s behalf, thus winning even more auctions for ad space and spending more of Hubble\u2019s money on it \u2014 first $1 a minute, then $2 a minute, then more than $3. By 2 p.m., Facebook\u2019s A.I. had charged Hubble $306.50 to put that ad in front of 9,684 users. The second ad, after an outlay of $8.03, had been all but abandoned. And the third ad was hardly given a chance: Since 8 a.m., it had appeared before only 30 people.\u201cNo idea why,\u201d Rosen said, shaking his head. Rosen could see all sorts of data arranged in neat rows on Facebook\u2019s Ads Manager program: the number of views, clicks, sales and the average cost, in advertising, of acquiring each new customer. But none of the metrics at Rosen\u2019s fingertips could resolve a fundamental mystery: why the algorithm behaved as it did, why it preferred some ads over others and why the third ad got little attention whatsoever.The morning\u2019s ads were incredibly similar: \u201chubblecontacts,\u201d the company\u2019s Instagram handle, appeared at the top, above pictures of boxes in peach, blue, yellow and green. The only differences were that the first ad showed the boxes of contact lenses lined up against a blue background; in the second and third ads, they were set against a split pink-and-blue background and were arranged diagonally in the second and scattershot in the third. But they were all just boxes! Did Instagram users really prefer contact-lens ads with strict rows of boxes or blue backgrounds? Had rules been written into the algorithm favoring orderly arrangements? (The Hubble team knew Facebook favored certain aesthetics.) To what extent was the day\u2019s outcome, apparently set in motion when the first ad happened to get that first click in the morning, actually random? Rosen could only guess.In the early 2010s, direct-to-consumer companies showboated. But lacking the money for big TV ad campaigns, they relied instead on old-fashioned public relations, panache and luck. Warby Parker hired a public-relations firm to pitch its concept to Vogue and GQ and debuted its website on the same day issues reached subscribers. It also held an event featuring bespectacled models at the New York Public Library during Fashion Week. Dollar Shave Club first succeeded on account of the exquisite timing, both commercial and comedic, of its founder, Michael Dubin. He made a funny, low-budget video introducing his company, then uploaded it to YouTube on the same day TechCrunch reported Dollar Shave Club\u2019s first round of venture funding. Within days, after some immediate attention at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., Dubin had three million views online.Facebook\u2019s sales pitch \u2014 putting the right ad in front of the right person, thanks to the wonders of data technology \u2014 isn\u2019t exactly new. As far back as 1964, William Allan, a business editor for The Pittsburgh Press, reported that in the near future, \u201ccomputers will tell businessmen which half of their advertising budgets are being wasted.\u201d Thirty years later, The Economist described an effort to take advantage of American Express\u2019s transactional records: \u201cPowerful data-crunching computers known as massive parallel processors, equipped with neural-network software (which searches, like the human brain, for patterns in a mass of data), hold out a vision of marketing nirvana.\u201d Companies like Acxiom, Experian and Datalogix have been offering similar data-mining services to direct marketers for years. What sets Facebook (and Google) apart are scale and sophistication.A recent study by a Princeton professor, Arvind Narayanan, and a doctoral candidate, Steven Englehardt, provides a sense of how thoroughly the two online giants monitor user behavior. In early 2016, they examined the top one million websites in the world, using special bots they developed to scour them for tracking mechanisms. Google had trackers on 76 percent of these sites, Facebook on 23 percent of them. (Twitter, in third place, had trackers on just over 12 percent of the sites.) The tech giants can examine all this data looking for patterns and then match them back to prospective customers.What also sets Facebook and Google apart from their direct-marketing forebears is that they give access to everyday advertisers. Anyone with a credit card can go online and test ads on Facebook\u2019s platform, one of the most sophisticated direct-marketing operations ever. But while average people can use the machine, there\u2019s still a lot of mystery about how it works. The methods and calculations of the algorithm \u2014 why it ends up pushing some ads and not others \u2014 are all hidden.Almost as soon as they began, Rosen, Horwitz and the others at Hubble became determined to fathom the algorithm\u2019s secrets \u2014 to figure out why some ads succeeded and others didn\u2019t. Soon they were trading hypotheses with other entrepreneurs, cribbing ideas from other companies\u2019 ads and taking a formal approach to testing, rooted in the scientific method. They uploaded ads with identical images but different wordings, for example. The Hubble team wound up concluding all sorts of things. Ads with third-party endorsements \u2014 from GQ, say, or BuzzFeed \u2014 beat those with their own slogans. Ads featuring close-ups of the Hubble boxes outperformed those with human models. Ads that included a button that said \u201cShop Now\u201d or \u201cLearn More\u201d fared worse than an ad with no button at all; viewers simply preferred to click anywhere on the picture to go to the website.But even as the Hubble team gleaned more about what yielded successful Facebook ads, the algorithm could be unpredictable, almost moody. If you kept loading the same ads into the same ad set every day, they stopped performing as well. The founders figured at first that users were tiring of the same ads. But actual viewer numbers revealed that practically no individual user had seen any ad more than once. The algorithm itself seemed to grow bored. At night, meanwhile, the algorithm spent lots of money and rarely found customers. The Hubble executives started shrinking the budgets at 11 p.m., which they called \u201cputting the algorithm to bed.\u201d The algorithm could also be impulsive and streaky \u2014 some days it might go on a sudden jag, blowing a thousand dollars in a few hours with nothing to show for it. At any time, any one of the 15 different ad sets might go haywire. Rosen found himself checking the Ads Manager compulsively on his laptop and his iPhone. (Facebook offers an iOS app for advertisers.) \u201cIt occupies my brain constantly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling of \u2018Did you leave the oven on?\u2019\u2009\u201dOne night we went to a standup-comedy night Rosen hosted at a bar called Muchmore\u2019s in Brooklyn. (For the past four years, he has moonlighted as a comedian.) But while the other comics were onstage, Rosen was on the Ads Manager the whole time. \u201cWho cares about jokes?\u201d he quipped afterward.Eager for help, Rosen sought guidance from a former Facebook employee named Faheem Siddiqi, who now runs his own marketing agency. Hubble\u2019s sales representative at Facebook told him that Siddiqi had figured out the best ways to optimize Facebook advertising campaigns. But it turned out that Siddiqi and his employees checked the Ads Manager even more compulsively than Rosen \u2014 every half-hour, for up to 16 hours a day. When I asked Siddiqi to share his tips for managing Facebook ads, he replied, \u201cStep\u20091 is meditation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a baby,\u201d Jesse Horwitz told me. \u201cIf you go more than half an hour without checking in on it, it\u2019s probably dead.\u201d (Horwitz, who is married, does not yet have children.)Recently ProPublica, the investigative-journalism nonprofit, showed how bad actors can abuse this process: Facebook\u2019s software gave advertisers the option to target \u201cJew Haters,\u201d for instance. In a separate investigation, ProPublica found that Facebook made it possible to exclude specific \u201cethnic affinities\u201d from seeing ads, noting that ads excluding people based on race are prohibited by federal housing and employment laws.This stereotyping isn\u2019t a glitch of Facebook\u2019s machine-learning process \u2014 it\u2019s how the software works. To formulate audiences, the algorithm scours profiles and analyzes them for shared traits and correlations and self-identified interests and, it assumes, our preferences, grouping us into tribes that can be targeted. It\u2019s up to Facebook and advertisers to constrain this amoral process in ethical and lawful ways. Yet the ethics of targeting are not clear-cut. In May, The Australian reported that Facebook employees had prepared a document showing how they could gather details on teenagers during vulnerable moments \u2014 when Facebook users feel \u201cstressed,\u201d \u201cinsecure,\u201d \u201cdefeated\u201d or \u201cworthless.\u201d Is that immoral, or simply crass?Such challenges are opening a new front for companies and corporate-responsibility watchdogs. Bad human actors don\u2019t pose the only problem; a machine-learning algorithm, left unchecked, can misbehave and compound inequality on its own, no help from humans needed. The same mechanism that decides that 30-something women who like yoga disproportionately buy Lululemon tights \u2014 and shows them ads for more yoga wear \u2014 would also show more junk-food ads to impoverished populations rife with diabetes and obesity.\u201cSometimes data behaves unethically,\u201d Antonio Garcia-Martinez, a former Facebook employee who worked on the advertising team, wrote in an essay in The Guardian. He provided an example from his time at the company: \u201cSomeone on the data-science team had cooked up a new tool that recommended Facebook pages users should like. And what did this tool start spitting out? Every ethnic stereotype you can imagine.\u201dAs algorithms sort users in increasingly complex ways \u2014 already the multivaried criteria for determining a Lookalike group defies human comprehension \u2014 regulators and companies will have to confront how to determine who is being nudged, and why, and whether that\u2019s benefiting the public or exacerbating societal ills. An algorithm that draws its lessons from the present reality can\u2019t be counted on to improve the course of the future on its own.Facebook\u2019s A.I. isn\u2019t operating unattended, certainly: Garcia-Martinez wrote that Facebook decided not to release the recommendation tool. Facebook points out that it makes efforts to prevent harmful advertising. It does not, for instance, allow ads for payday loans, which prey on the poor. It says it has removed advertisers\u2019 ability to target users by ethnicity when promoting housing, employment or credit; it removed \u201cJew Haters\u201d and other objectionable categories and said it would increase human review of its ad-targeting options. In response to the report in The Australian, Facebook said the analysis \u201cwas intended to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook. It was never used to target ads.\u201dYet managing a platform this way \u2014 seeing what mischief the algorithm and its users gets up to, then responding with countermeasures \u2014 can be difficult to sustain. \u201cThis is a whack-a-mole problem, one among many Facebook has,\u201d Garcia-Martinez told me. It makes Facebook, a company still largely controlled by a single man, Mark Zuckerberg, the ultimate arbiter of morality and taste for all two billion of its users. It also means the company has unilateral power to make or break companies when it tweaks its system.This is not a hypothetical possibility. In 2013, media sites like those measured by the BuzzFeed Partner network, which includes BuzzFeed, Thought Catalog and The New York Times, noticed a huge surge in referrals from Facebook \u2014 a jump of more than 50 million page views from August to October. A year later, Facebook announced that it had adjusted its news-feed algorithm to eliminate so-called click bait. Upworthy, a peddler of stories with headlines like \u201c9 Out of 10 Americans Are Completely Wrong About This Mind-Blowing Fact,\u201d had its total page views decline by half in the span of three months, from 90 million to 48 million visitors. (At the time of these huge shifts, 30 percent of Americans got news from Facebook. In 2017, 45 percent of Americans do, according to Pew Research Center.)\u201cWe always knew that Facebook is sort of like the weather,\u201d says Eli Pariser, Upworthy\u2019s co-founder and president. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be sunny days and stormy days.\u201d In response to the algorithm adjustment, Pariser instructed his staff to stop posting as many videos to YouTube, which is owned by Google, and start publishing more videos directly to Facebook instead.\u201cThat certainly served Facebook well,\u201d Pariser admits. \u201cBut you know, I also wouldn\u2019t be able to reach 200 million people on any other medium,\u201d he says, citing the reach of Upworthy\u2019s videos on Facebook. The platform may be mercurial, but Upworthy still relies on it.Imagine, now, that Facebook tweaks its algorithm in a way that \u2014 rather than cause wild swings in web traffic\u200b \u200bto a purveyor of viral videos \u2014 leads to a steep decline in advertising and sales for a consumer-products company, one that happens to be the largest employer in a small town. Or imagine\u200b \u200bmultiple\u200b \u200bcompanies shaken up by such an adjustment, or an entire industry overhauling its practices\u200b \u200bto suit Facebook.\u200b \u200bEven the threat and uncertainty of those possibilities could\u200b \u200bhurt\u200b \u200bbusinesses, which depend on predictable returns to invest in future projects.As we delegate more control to artificial intelligence, both businesses as well as users are venturing into uncertain territory. In the meantime, more and more companies \u2014 start-ups, mom-and-pop stores, major corporations \u2014 are handing their dollars and their data to the social-networking giant. Facebook\u2019s Ads Manager is user-friendly. Sales are plentiful. And if you don\u2019t take advantage of it, your competitors will. How could you not go there?But by the end of June, Rosen\u2019s stress-free life was still a dream. A new problem arose: No matter what new ads they put in an ad set, the growth rate of sales declined and the cost per acquisition went up. They began to think it was an audience problem: Had they found all the customers in those groups? With their ad sets going fallow, the Hubble team scrambled to find fresh and fertile ground. Their ideas for new audiences got quirkier, more outlandish. One week they zeroed in on people who like Sweetgreen, the salad chain. Next they went after people who had indicated that they were fans of bottled water, whoever they are. Each group fizzled after a few days \u2014 the cost per each new customer climbed higher and higher; sales dwindled. As they searched for more and more audience descriptors, they landed upon a novel idea: They began trading their Lookalike groups with other online retailers, figuring that the kind of people who buy one product from social media will probably buy others. This sort of audience sharing is becoming more common on Facebook: There is even a company, TapFwd, that pools together Lookalike groups for various brands, helping them show ads to other groups.Cogan and Horwitz have decided that they need to reduce their dependence on Facebook advertising, for the sake of their business and their own sanity. In May, they tested their first 15-second cable-television commercials. With TV, the data is vaguer, and it takes longer to get results back. Yet even though the old medium provides them with less information than Facebook, in some ways the ignorance is bliss. \u201cThere\u2019s fewer levers; there\u2019s less to stress out about.\u201d Rodgers says. \u201cYou can push the button and get on with your life.\u201dIn August, the Hubble team finally handed over their domestic Facebook advertising work to an outside agency, Ampush, that charges them based on how many new customers sign up. Ten people at Ampush now do the job of Rosen and Robo-Dan. Still, the handoff was bittersweet. \u201cWe ran their numbers \u2014 it\u2019s something we could beat,\u201d Rosen says, meaning Hubble could get more customers for less money if it did the ad buying in-house. \u201cBut it would destroy our lives.\u201dThanks largely to Facebook, Hubble is on track to finish its first full year in business having made $20 million in revenue. In August, Hubble raised $10 million, valuing the company at $210 million. In January, Hubble will use those funds to expand its business to Continental Europe. Its advertising strategy? Robo-Dan, with some help from Rosen. As Hubble advances into new territories, Facebook and the algorithm will be tagging along with them.Burt Helm is a senior contributing writer for Inc. magazine.

But in the realm of public opinion, climate change isn\u2019t really a scientific issue. It\u2019s a political one.Even though better-educated Republicans may have more exposure to information about the science around climate change, they also have more exposure to partisan messages about it. And communications research says that matters more.On many other issues \u2013 social issues in particular, including abortion, gay marriage and divorce \u2013 more  education is associated with higher rates of acceptance, regardless of party. Gaps between Democrats and Republicans persisted, but the relationships moved more or less in tandem:On most other issues, education had little effect. Americans\u2019 views on terrorism, immigration, taxes on the wealthiest, and the state of health care in the United States did not change appreciably by education for Democrats and Republicans.Only a handful of issues had a shape like the one for climate change, in which higher education corresponded with higher agreement among Democrats and lower agreement among Republicans.So what distinguishes these issues, climate change in particular?It may be easier to think about in terms of simple partisanship. Most Americans know what party they belong to, but they can\u2019t be expected to know the details of every issue, so they tend to adopt the views of the leaders of the party they already identify with.Climate change is not a social issue like gay marriage, divorce, racism or abortion \u2013 issues where Democrats\u2019 and Republicans\u2019 views move in tandem with education. On those kinds of issues, college-educated Americans of both parties tend to be more progressive.But Americans do not treat climate change like a scientific issue either. In the past, consensus from the scientific community on factual issues effectively ended serious disagreement among elites, whether it was about things like whether blacks and whites have the same kind of blood or whether homosexuality was rooted in mental illness.All survey results are from Gallup. \u201cRepublican\u201d includes respondents who identify as \u201cRepublican\u201d or \u201cleaning Republican,\u201d and \u201cDemocrat\u201d includes respondents who identify as \u201cDemocratic\u201d or \u201cleaning Democratic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Culture Caught Up With Spike Lee \u2014 Now What?", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "FeatureAfter more than three decades as a provocateur, the filmmaker has returned to the movie that made him famous.Supported byAs I was preparing to visit him there this summer, Lee warned me that the second week of August is when \u201ceverybody\u201d descends on the Vineyard. He did not lie. The annual African-American Film Festival was happening, and the sheer saturation of black achievement on display \u2014 on an 87-square-mile strip of land that is home to some of the first integrated beaches in the country and also synonymous with the liliest-lily-white establishment \u2014 was something to behold. In the previous 24 hours, both Barack Obama and the two-time N.B.A. champion Ray Allen had teed off behind Lee\u2019s house; as my Uber turned down Lee\u2019s dirt driveway, Henry Louis Gates Jr. pedaled past on a tricycle. Lee has long been a fixture at the festival, and this year he would be previewing his latest project, a 10-episode Netflix reboot of the very film that made him a star: \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d A late-career foray into prestige television, the series, released this week, marks a homecoming of sorts, as well as a risky departure.My driver, an amiable 6-foot-8 Jamaican man who grew up in Canarsie, became star-struck when Lee came to meet our car and did not want to pull away. \u201cWhat high school you go to?\u201d Lee asked him by way of greeting. Schools and sports teams are the kinds of affiliations that genuinely mean a lot to him. The driver\u2019s answer seemed satisfactory, but then Lee noticed his backward baseball cap and asked to see the front of it. The driver sheepishly swiveled it around. \u201cIt\u2019s a B for Brooklyn,\u201d he tried.Lee was dressed more or less as himself, with a white Yankees cap, blue plastic frames and a diamond stud gleaming in his left earlobe. He had draped bright blue-and-orange plastic necklaces and two long gold chains suspending a chunky crucifix over a dark blue Yankees jersey. He also had on Knicks-colored Nikes, a Knicks-colored G-Shock watch, numerous matching blue-and-orange plastic bracelets and a beautiful one made out of solid gold. The sheer quantity of flair on his person was Pharaonic.He led me to the wraparound porch off the main house, to a white table with his papers spread on it. When he had checked and silenced his BlackBerry \u2014 he still uses one \u2014 I brought up Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s latest movie, \u201cDetroit,\u201d which opened the African-American Film Festival two days earlier. The film, about the violence inflicted by white police officers on black residents of Detroit during the 1967 riots, had upset audiences. Many black critics, and some white ones, had been making the case that it wasn\u2019t Bigelow\u2019s right as a white person to tell such a story in the first place \u2014 that her lingering and detailed depiction of the violence took on the qualities of pornography. I asked Lee if he agreed with that assessment.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d Lee said. \u201cShe\u2019s a very good director. She knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d He thought for a moment, then added: \u201cBut I do understand the flip side. Black folks get kind of funny now with other people telling our stories.\u201d Lee himself has long been one of the most outspoken critics of such work. He has famously feuded with Quentin Tarantino over what he views as Tarantino\u2019s appropriation and exploitation of blackness, particularly in \u201cDjango Unchained.\u201d \u201cAmerican Slavery Was Not a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western,\u201d Lee wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt Was a Holocaust.\u201d And he wrested \u201cMalcolm X\u201d away from the director Norman Jewison on the grounds, according to Jewison, that he lacked \u201cthe deep understanding of the black psyche\u201d required to handle the subject. Sitting on his porch, Lee lifted his cap and ran a hand across his freshly buzzed scalp. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a clich\u00e9,\u201d he said, laughing, \u201cbut people are kind of woke.\u201dIn such a context, Lee\u2019s decision to remake \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d can seem like an advertisement for himself, a savvy, scripted campaign to remind a viewing public with a very short attention span just who was here first. But for someone who has cut against the grain for so long and from so many angles, this return to the beginning can also look like a tacit concession that one of America\u2019s sharpest, most provocative personalities may have finally run out of grain to cut against.But those victories didn\u2019t amount to much, in Lee\u2019s estimation. The journalist, Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, grew increasingly despondent. \u201cWhy should I have expected more than any other white interviewer has elicited from this 35-year-old producer, writer, director and world-class hustler who courts the media and simultaneously repels inquiry with set speeches, set postures, attitude? Why should I have entertained the hope that we could leap over the dividing wall of color?\u201dOne of the most striking aspects of reading the article in 2017 is Harrison\u2019s reaction, not Lee\u2019s statements. What he says, from our current vantage, seems unexceptional \u2014 talking like that about race has practically become an orthodoxy. And this is one of the more intriguing challenges Lee, who recently turned 60, will be facing with \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d In terms of the racial politics of the day, he is more in tune than ever with mainstream liberal thought. In terms of sexual politics, however, to borrow Lee\u2019s own phrasing, women are also getting kind of funny about other people telling their stories. And younger female auteurs like Issa Rae and Lena Dunham have seized the means of narrative production, portraying female sexuality and desire in ever more urgent and original ways.What Harrison missed about her subject is that Lee has never been anything other than a first-rate color-line traverser. Born Shelton Lee in 1957 in Atlanta, the eldest of six, he moved with his family to Brooklyn when he was small. The Lees became the first black family to integrate Cobble Hill, a heavily Italian-American neighborhood near the waterfront. \u201cWe got called nigger this and nigger that,\u201d he said with a shrug, when I asked what that was like. Once his new neighbors discerned that there were no more black families following his, they seemed to relax. From that point on, Lee \u2014 whose mother, Jacquelyn, had taken to calling Spike because he was \u201ca tough baby\u201d \u2014 made friends mostly with white kids. \u201cBut my mother was a visionary,\u201d he said, so his parents saved and bought a brownstone facing the park in Fort Greene, which was then all black, \u201cfor like $45,000.\u201d (Houses on that street now routinely top $3 million.) Jacquelyn died from cancer in 1976 and never saw her son\u2019s success. His father, Bill, remarried a Lithuanian-American Jew with dreadlocks who referred to herself as \u201cspiritually black.\u201d Bill still lives in that same brownstone.Lee descends, as he puts it, \u201cfrom a long line of educated Negroes.\u201d After graduating from John Dewey High School in 1975, he went to Morehouse College, just as his father and grandfather did. His mother went to Spelman, and so did her mother, Zimmie Shelton, the granddaughter of a slave, who went on to teach art, and, Lee says, \u201csaved the Social Security checks\u201d so that she was able to put him through both college and N.Y.U. film school, where his contemporaries included Jim Jarmusch and Ang Lee. Today he is the artistic director of N.Y.U.\u2019s graduate film program.Claude Grunitzky, an entrepreneur and the founder of the pioneering urban-culture magazine Trace, has known Lee and collaborated on commercial and editorial projects with him since the \u201990s. He explained to me that Lee was always aware of his own value, and that as a result, he made significantly more money from his films than a typical independent director. Because he owns 40 Acres, Grunitzky said, \u201che can find a way to pay himself as opposed to being victim to a Hollywood studio.\u201d I asked Grunitzky why everybody doesn\u2019t do that, and his response was simple: \u201cVery few people can get away with it.\u201d Lee\u2019s near-solitary status as a black auteur for much of his career allowed him to find financing in unconventional places. When, for example, Warner Brothers balked at putting up the money to produce the version of \u201cMalcolm X\u201d Lee wanted to make, he was able to circumvent the studio and petition the most prominent members of the black 1 percent, including Magic Johnson, Oprah Winfrey and Bill Cosby, to open their pocketbooks.Lee also brought in lucrative advertising deals through his company Spike DDB. The eight black-and-white Air Jordan commercials he directed for Nike in the early \u201990s \u2014 and in which he co-starred as his character Mars Blackmon \u2014 were nearly as pivotal in embedding the product within the culture as the young M.V.P.\u2019s offense. (To this day, Nike continues to make a highly coveted riff on the sneaker called the Spizike.) In \u201cThe Spike Lee Reader,\u201d the film scholar Paula J. Massood noted that \u201cLee\u2019s production and advertising companies (the latter in particular) provide the financial foundations\u201d for him to pursue deeply original work without caving to market imperatives. Selling out, in other words, to avoid selling out.Yet despite having cracked the code of how to be a well-compensated artist \u2014 one whose beak, in real terms, is practically soaking \u2014 Lee is resistant to being thought of as wealthy. Whenever the conversation turns to money, he tends to compare himself not with everyday Americans \u2014 let alone black people \u2014 or even with other artists, but with billionaire moguls. \u201cI didn\u2019t make as much as Spielberg or Lucas, you know,\u201d he told me. In 2008, he told The New Yorker that he was \u201cnot rich rich.\u201d He went on: \u201cRich is Spielberg. Lucas. Gates. Steve Jobs. Jay-Z! Bruce Springsteen. I\u2019m not complaining. But that\u2019s money. Will Smith. Tyler Perry. Oprah Winfrey \u2014 that\u2019s a ton of money. Compared to them, I\u2019m on welfare!\u201dIt\u2019s an almost ludicrously self-indulgent way of interpreting gradations of hyperaffluence, but I could also see Lee\u2019s point. It was Lee who discovered and first cast Halle Berry. It is Lee whose homes are filled with signed photos saying \u201cthank you\u201d from Michael Jordan. It was Lee who was the first in the hip-hop era to aestheticize both the black college milieu that Kanye West used as a launchpad as well as the brownstone Brooklyn landscape that anticipated the borough\u2019s 21st-century renaissance. All of which is why it may be incongruous, yet on some level not outlandish, to think of Spike Lee as still not having gotten his full due.\u201cHe basically cashed in all the good will he had from \u2018Inside Man\u2019 to raise funds for \u2018Miracle at St. Anna,\u2019\u2009\u201d said James McBride, the National Book Award-winning author of the novel from which the script, about a real-life all-black regiment in Italy during World War II, was adapted in 2008. It, too, was a commercial failure. \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma of a talented black artist in any field,\u201d McBride told me. \u201cYou have to recreate the genre, otherwise you don\u2019t survive. Stevie Wonder is not a pop musician; Stevie Wonder is a genre. Michael Jackson is a genre to himself. Spike Lee has moved into that territory. Spike Lee is not short on talent. What Spike Lee is short on is friends in the industry, and the kind of space to fail. He has no room to fail.\u201d Rosie Perez, a longtime collaborator of Lee\u2019s, echoed McBride\u2019s sentiments over the phone. \u201cFor someone of Spike\u2019s stature to have to extend himself the way he has to to get something done is just insulting,\u201d she told me, growing emotional as she spoke.These observations about the specific plight of the black genius \u2014 that lack of margin for error \u2014 called to mind something the comedian Chris Rock has said: True equality would look less like a black president than like a black Sarah Palin. In culture as in politics, while many profess to value diversity, there remains scant space for a thriving black \u201cmiddle class\u201d within the industry, a healthy ecosystem of artists and others working at varying levels of talent and acclaim. (In a 2016 Annenberg survey of Hollywood directors, 87 percent of respondents were white.) This winner-takes-all system has led to some magnificent black art in recent years, from Barry Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMoonlight\u201d to Donald Glover\u2019s \u201cAtlanta\u201d to Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out.\u201d But such breakthroughs can be counted on five fingers at best.As Lee sees it, the solution to the problem will not come from the artists themselves. \u201cEven now with \u2018She\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u2019\u2009\u201d Lee said to me on his porch, \u201cmany people had passed on it. The reason it got made was because Netflix has three black women executives \u2014 Pauline Fischer, Tara Duncan and Layne Eskridge \u2014 who knew the cultural significance of Nola Darling and Mars Blackmon. Other people didn\u2019t get it.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think all the others passed?\u201d I asked.\u201cEvery time someone says no, they never tell you why, they\u2019re very polite. They\u2019re not going to say, \u2018This sucks,\u2019 because they don\u2019t want to burn a bridge, and they want you to come with the next thing.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut all the people who said no \u2014 there was no black person in the room with them!\u201dThree decades into his career, Lee\u2019s singular achievement seems to have led him to the realization that he cannot, in fact, do it alone. Making a Hollywood with more diverse gatekeepers is an issue of such importance to him that he says it would be worth giving back his Oscar \u2014 a point he made to me emphatically and repeatedly. But it\u2019s not just a matter of fairness. He sees it as an issue of practical importance, and in the service of this point, he brought up the excruciating Pepsi ad from this spring. In it, Kendall Jenner wanders off a fashion shoot into something like a Black Lives Matter protest and hands a can of soda to a cop, bringing joy to all, police officers and demonstrators alike. \u201cIf there were just somebody advising the room with any common sense,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cLike, \u2018Yo! My man \u2014 that [expletive] is [expletive] up!\u2019\u2009\u201d He grew serious again. \u201cGetting those gatekeeping positions. That\u2019s the last \u2014 that\u2019s where the battle is.\u201d\u201cTwenty-seven world championships! Thank you!\u201d Lee shot back without missing a beat or betraying the least bit of surprise to be addressed so familiarly by a perfect stranger.Lee pushed ahead in his customary, slightly pigeon-toed gait, torso tipped forward, necklaces swinging from his neck. I told him that I recently rewatched \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d and was astounded by the degree to which it felt au courant and even prescient. The scene late in the film when an N.Y.P.D. officer places Radio Raheem in an illegal chokehold, killing him, was shattering to watch, melding in my mind with phone-camera footage of Eric Garner, who was killed in 2014 on Staten Island in similar fashion. And the question at the heart of the drama \u2014 just whose vision of black life can (or should) prevail, anyway, Malcolm\u2019s or Martin\u2019s \u2014 was trenchant. Lee\u2019s own views on that question remain satisfyingly ambiguous. While the film seems to imply that it is Malcolm who personifies genuine integrity, Lee has also observed that Radio Raheem could have behaved differently and avoided his violent fate.Yet the film amounts to much more than mere social commentary: Like \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d and \u201cSchool Daze\u201d before it, it was itself an engine of culture. And in addition to Samuel L. Jackson, it gave us our first glimpses of Rosie Perez, Giancarlo Esposito (\u201cBefore he was Gus in \u2018Breaking Bad,\u2019 the culture knew him as Buggin\u2019 Out,\u201d Lee reminded me) and a fresh-faced Martin Lawrence. It caused a sensation at Cannes, but back home, critics including Stanley Crouch and Joe Klein worried that it would start riots. It is mind-blowing to pause and think that a film as forward-facing and potent as \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d was released the same year as \u201cDriving Ms. Daisy.\u201d \u201cDriving Ms. [expletive] Daisy.\u201d Lee shook his head. \u201cThe best film of the year 1989, brought to you by your Academy members.\u201dAs we walked on, Lee seemed to grow weary of talking. The afternoon heat was fatiguing, and we got turned around and lost in a dirt-road labyrinth along the golf course, doubling back on ourselves until we came to a cafe in a clearing, where two beautiful black women, who looked as if the universe itself belonged to them, were facing the course, sipping ros\u00e9 of the hue the French call gray.\u201cOh, [expletive], there\u2019s my wife,\u201d Lee exclaimed, leading me over to Tonya Lewis Lee, a statuesque, green-eyed blonde whose hair was sheared shorter on the sides than on top. She glanced questioningly at her husband and then extended her hand.\u201cI did not tell Spike I was going to be here.\u201d\u201cHe just slipped a LoJack in your bag,\u201d her friend Crystal said, laughing.Tonya is an attorney and an entertainment-industry force in her own right. She is the executive producer of the new \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d the impetus for which she describes as twofold: a chance for the two of them to work together and to present as fresh a vision of contemporary Brooklyn as Lee first did in the \u201980s. \u201cIt was her idea,\u201d Lee acknowledged. \u201cI did not see it.\u201dI asked her what it\u2019s like to work with her husband.\u201cBeing married to Spike is crazy every day,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cWorking with him, it\u2019s like: \u2018We\u2019re going to do it the way I do it, because, by the way, have you seen my r\u00e9sum\u00e9? Do you need my bio? Here\u2019s my bio \u2014 I\u2019ve done 30 films in 30 years.\u2019 You know, and that\u2019s how it goes.\u201dLee stood off to the side staring into the distance, a slightly amused expression playing on his face, and did not contradict her.The film tells the story of one Nola Darling, a 20-something with a spacious loft in Brooklyn and lots of scented candles, who is basking in her youth and in the world\u2019s reaction. Played by Tracy Camilla Johns, she is pursued by men and women alike, unashamedly enjoys sex and has it regularly with a persistent square named Jaime Overstreet, a ludicrous B-boy named Mars Blackmon \u2014 played by Lee \u2014 and an equally preposterous, self-obsessed male model called Greer Childs. All of the men are in possession of more resonant personalities than Nola, who is something of a cipher. In the film\u2019s denouement, an act of consensual sex turns so ugly so fast it can be described only as a rape, and it is difficult to stomach, though Nola herself seems to take the brutality in stride and even suggests that she deserved it. More shocking, the scene functions as a moment of epiphany through which her character is able to develop into a better, more stable person. By the end of the story, she has decided to commit herself to the very man who violated her.In a scathing essay titled \u201cWhose Pussy Is This: A Feminist Comment,\u201d the scholar Bell Hooks described Lee\u2019s protagonist as \u201c\u2009\u2018pure pussy,\u2019 that is to say that her ability to perform sexually is the central, defining aspect of her identity.\u201d The film, in Hooks\u2019s view, was contaminated by \u201cthe pervasive sense that we have witnessed a woman being disempowered and not a woman coming to power.\u201d Lee seems as close to chastened as possible by the criticism, and emphasized to me that five writers on the Netflix reboot are women. That is either an overdue development or an earnest act of penance or both. Yet as I compared Lee\u2019s original creation with the Netflix series, the effort to atone for that rape scene \u2014 and all the other ambiguous attitudes it rendered explicit \u2014 felt forced, even conformist. And such lack of edge is compounded by society\u2019s shifting sexual mores: \u201cEverybody\u2019s got three lovers now,\u201d Samuel L. Jackson, another longtime collaborator of his, told me skeptically. \u201cThat\u2019s not controversial, that\u2019s kind of normal.\u201dFor these and other reasons, the series can seem a lot less interested in eros than ideology, functioning as a platform to disseminate right-thinking messages about black culture and beauty standards, misogyny, homophobia, mental illness and policing. Toward the end of the first episode, a millennial Nola Darling, played by DeWanda Wise, turns straight into the camera and declares out of nowhere that \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d It\u2019s a move so timely and didactically on the nose that it permanently ripped me out of the fictive dream. And ever since then, I have thought of that scene more than any other, and of its meaning for the project as an artistic endeavor.I could not shake the suspicion, watching \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d that Lee made better, more bracing work in the era in which he was more conscious and more irreverent than the culture at large \u2014 a time when he found himself freer to enlighten as well as offend. The shift seemed to come somewhere around 2015\u2019s \u201cChi-Raq,\u201d a surreal spin on Aristophanes\u2019 play about the Peloponnesian War, updated to take on the fraught subject of homicide in Chicago. In the movie, as in the play that inspired it, women impose a sex strike to pressure their men into a cease-fire. Critics liked it. Yet before it was even released, the film was consumed by controversy over the title and by concerns over whether the city\u2019s miseries should even be appropriated for cinematic purposes \u2014 let alone for ones with a self-critical bent.Skeptics took issue with Lee\u2019s intentionally fantastical plot, calling it glib and insensitive. \u201c\u2009\u2018Chi-Raq\u2019 leans heavily on the not-at-all-modern but seductive power of enduring sexual stereotypes ... to sell a sexual strike as a viable solution to Chicago\u2019s staggering murder rate,\u201d Janell Ross wrote in The Washington Post. \u201cIt puts us in the zone of facile, no-cost, no-government-or-public-\u200bengagement-needed solutions to a big and complicated problem.\u201d Representatives of the local hip-hop scene bristled at the notion of an outsider telling their story, from Chief Keef\u2019s manager to the Grammy winner Chance the Rapper, who released a blistering fusillade of tweets deeming the film both \u201csexist\u201d and \u201cracist.\u201d Lee responded by calling the rapper a \u201cfraud.\u201d\u201cBlack Twitter is a [expletive], I\u2019m telling you,\u201d Lee said, shaking his head over the outcry that met his film on social media. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a force to be reckoned with.\u201d Perhaps that is why, at the time of the movie\u2019s release, he, too, began to justify himself not in strictly artistic terms but in primarily social ones: He told reporters that he wanted to save lives. As we spoke on his porch, he circled back several times to the Windy City\u2019s mortality crisis, each pass growing more and more agitated. Finally, he began to sketch in his notebook a series of circles representing homicide rates in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles for 2016, the first one dwarfing the others.At that moment, Lee\u2019s balancing act \u2014 as both representative and critic of black America \u2014 seemed simultaneously inescapable and overwhelming to me. I began to suspect it might seem that way to him as well.The following night, I accompanied Lee to his screening of a Netflix one-off called \u201cRodney King,\u201d a film he made of an ingenious one-man show about Los Angeles in the \u201990s \u2014 but really about America today \u2014 written and performed by Roger Guenveur Smith, another of his longtime collaborators. Lee wore a denim jacket that had Esposito\u2019s face as Buggin\u2019 Out airbrushed on the back of it. He does not even try to blend into crowds, and before we could get inside the building, he posed for a dozen pictures. A retired black physician pitched him a movie project about a retired black physician on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Lee politely declined.Inside, the auditorium of the local high school was bustling. Branford Marsalis and Junot D\u00edaz were milling about, as was Guenveur Smith. For an hour onscreen, his sweaty, wide-eyed face held the room rapt. The performance was so sui generis and captivating, Lee didn\u2019t have to do anything but set up cameras at a variety of angles and record it. Yet it is precisely the kind of offbeat, hallucinatory and essential project that also requires a deeply attuned but independent force to bring about.Two nights later, Lee closed the festival with a screening of a teaser for \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d \u2014 again at the high school in front of another packed house. It was Saturday, Aug. 12, the afternoon when white nationalists brought death to the streets of Charlottesville, Va. In the taxi, Lee had mentioned that he spoke to Obama earlier in the day, when he reached the 18th hole, behind Lee\u2019s house. Obama hadn\u2019t yet heard about what was happening because he\u2019d been out on the course all day. Somehow that image struck me as unbearably sad. Perhaps it struck Lee that way, too, and we quickly changed the subject.One of the things you hear over and over again about Lee is how loyal and generous he is in a business that is so often the opposite. He employs countless graduates of historically black colleges and universities in front of and especially behind the cameras, and many of them were at the screening, as well as hundreds of black Vineyard locals who had no particular connection but simply seemed grateful to be among the first to support one of their own, that rare voice who tells stories specifically for and about them. Lee calls black audiences like this his \u201cbase,\u201d and he told me that he always tests out his work in front of them first because they\u2019ll let you know \u201cif this some [expletive].\u201d He has cut scenes in the past after such encounters, including one from \u201cJungle Fever\u201d that Wesley Snipes advised him never to show. The base, that night, erupted in applause. I wondered if my initial misgivings had been too harsh.The poet Amiri Baraka once derisively wrote that Lee was \u201cthe quintessential buppie,\u201d his work frivolous and bourgeois, but that is vicious. The Rev. Michael L. Pfleger, the real-life Chicago preacher behind John Cusack\u2019s character in \u201cChi-Raq,\u201d described him as \u201cthe conscience of Hollywood,\u201d but that may be too generous. Roger Ebert, who recalled having been \u201ctoo shaken to speak\u201d after seeing \u201cDo the Right Thing,\u201d got the closest to the truth when he wrote about the fundamental \u201cevenhandedness that is at the center of Spike Lee\u2019s work,\u201d a quality that is sadly \u201cinvisible to many of his viewers and critics.\u201d It is this evenhandedness that causes some whites to recoil from him as angry, while at the very same time it makes some blacks cool to him as out of touch. It may be the most important, but by no means only, part of what makes him a genuine and lasting artist.The day after the festival ended, I met Lee at the 40 Acres and a Mule headquarters on South Elliott Place in Fort Greene, around the corner and down the block from where he grew up. It is a museum-like world unto itself that stretches over four floors all bursting with memorabilia, art, antique racial propaganda and movie posters with fond inscriptions from peers like Spielberg and Fellini. The outside of the building has always functioned as a way for Lee to communicate with the neighborhood directly. On that day, it was adorned with large, bright purple posters for the new \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d As he was locking up, three young black women approached him, took photos and thanked him for his work. He was still wearing the denim jacket with Esposito\u2019s face on it (and for good measure, carrying an orange backpack adorned with his own likeness as Mars Blackmon). As he walked me across Lafayette Avenue and down Fulton, cars honked and strangers waved. Lee acknowledged all of them.We had come to South Portland Avenue, where the local rap legend Notorious B.I.G. has for years now been reduced to a child-friendly caricature emblazoned on the side of an open-air Mexican-Cuban eco-cafe. \u201cBrooklyn is gentrified!\u201d Lee laughed, gesturing at all the new construction rising up around us. It is, and it has been for a long time now. Lee has solidified his own sort of landmarked status as a local and national treasure. But on that hot summer day, as we said goodbye and I watched him turn and walk away into that sanitized, rainbow-colored bobo wonderland, for the first time since I\u2019d met him he seemed almost out of place.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the 1963 church bombing that was the subject of Spike Lee\u2019s movie \u201c4 Little Girls.\u201d The bombing occurred at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., not in Little Rock, Ark.Thomas Chatterton Williams is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine.Advertisement"}

We needed to shut the door during their speeches for our security reasons.\u201dCommentators in Japan have suggested Ms. Trump played an instrumental role in planting the seeds of that relationship, which has since blossomed with the leaders\u2019 shared love of golf, which they are scheduled to play during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit.\u201cMr. Trump didn\u2019t like Japan at first,\u201d Katsuya Konishi, a journalist, said on a morning news show on TV Asahi on Friday. \u201cBut he gradually changed his mind. I think it was the influence of Ivanka. She said Prime Minister Abe is smart and advised Mr. Trump to listen to him.\u201dMs. Trump\u2019s appearance at the World Assembly for Women added a touch of celebrity glamour to the event, and was consistent with Mr. Abe\u2019s approach to female empowerment, in which public gestures have outstripped genuine change.And while Mr. Abe said that 1.5 million more women have joined the work force since he became prime minister five years ago, making women about 45 percent of the total in Japan, more than half of them work in part-time jobs with lower benefits and fewer hopes of career advancement.\u201cWhat is Ivanka Trump going to be to Japan more than a celebrity figure?\u201d said Nancy Snow, a professor of diplomacy at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies who attended the speech. \u201cIs she really going to up the ante here or move the needle? It\u2019s sort of window dressing and making Japan maybe feel better about itself, despite these statistics.\u201dAmong Japanese, reaction to Ms. Trump\u2019s visit reflected some entrenched attitudes toward women. Several commentators on TV Asahi noted the salmon-colored, miniskirted suit that Ms. Trump wore to her speech, and one suggested that her skirt was \u201crather short\u201d for a presidential adviser.Several women who attended Ms. Trump\u2019s speech commented on her appearance in explaining why they admired her.\u201cShe is a beautiful female leader,\u201d Rena Hayakawa, 21, a political science major at Meiji University in Tokyo, said before the speech. \u201cHer fashion is great.

{"Headline": "Sprint and T-Mobile End Merger Discussions", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySprint and T-Mobile said on Saturday that they had ended merger talks, marking the second time in three years that the two failed to reach a deal to create a stronger competitor to Verizon and AT&T.The announcement represents a setback to Sprint, T-Mobile and their majority shareholders \u2014 Sprint is owned by the Japanese technology giant SoftBank and T-Mobile by Deutsche Telekom of Germany \u2014 in their efforts to create a stronger third-place competitor in the American wireless market.But unlike three years ago, when Sprint and T-Mobile called off their last round of merger discussions because of strong opposition from the Barack Obama administration, this time the culprit was control.The final blow to the latest round of talks came Saturday night in Tokyo, when Tim H\u00f6ttges, the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, met at the Tokyo home of SoftBank\u2019s founder, Masayoshi Son, according to a person briefed on the matter. There, Mr. H\u00f6ttges delivered to Mr. Son and Sprint\u2019s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, new terms for a merger of the American companies.Mr. Son and Mr. Claure ultimately rejected the plan because it did not give SoftBank and Sprint enough control over the combined entity, people briefed on the discussions said.Choosing to abandon the deal talks means that Sprint and T-Mobile must now continue on their own paths to challenging their much bigger and better-financed rivals. For consumers, that probably signals a prolonging of a price war among the four wireless providers \u2014 one that analysts have said appears unsustainable for the smaller carriers in the long run.\u201cWe have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile\u2019s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record,\u201d John Legere, T-Mobile\u2019s chief executive, said in the statement.Mr. Claure of Sprint added in the statement, \u201cWe have agreed that it is best to move forward on our own.\u201dPeople briefed on the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, said that a deal always hinged on SoftBank\u2019s comfort with taking a minority stake in the combined business. Deutsche Telekom was expected to be the biggest shareholder of the merged company, given that T-Mobile is the bigger business by market value. T-Mobile\u2019s market capitalization as of Friday\u2019s close was $48.5 billion, while Sprint\u2019s was $26.7 billion.Though the two had been in on-again, off-again talks for months, they appeared to be making progress, with an eye on striking a deal before Thanksgiving. But at a SoftBank board meeting on Friday, several directors of the Japanese company expressed reservations about giving up control of a major telecom service provider, according to one of the people briefed on the matter.The stakes for Sprint and T-Mobile are perhaps higher now than they were in the summer of 2014, when the two last pursued a merger. While both have waged a price war against their bigger competitors, drawing new customers in the process, few in the industry believe that the Sprint and T-Mobile can sustain the costs of a drawn-out war against better-capitalized opponents.Walking away from a merger with T-Mobile will provide the biggest test yet of Mr. Son\u2019s ability to turn around Sprint after more than a decade of trouble. The billionaire led SoftBank\u2019s takeover of the troubled American telecom in 2012, paying nearly $22 billion for a majority stake.At the time, Mr. Son argued that he could take on Verizon and AT&T \u2014 but those ambitions hinged on ultimately combining his new telecom with T-Mobile. Then, Sprint was seen as the stronger company and in position to own a bigger share of the combined business.Three years later, however, T-Mobile has become the better performer, its brash cost-cutting campaign forced Verizon and AT&T into a tough price war. Sprint has largely lagged behind, though analysts praised its third-quarter financial performance as showing signs of promise.Putting the two companies together would have created a business with more scale \u2014 and more financial capability to pay for both network upgrades and discounts for service plans.Sprint, in particular, was seen as bearing a bigger financial burden, carrying $34.2 billion in long-term debt on its books as of Sept. 30, while having posted annual losses for years. T-Mobile, while reporting $27.7 billion in long-term debt as of Sept. 30, has been profitable every year since 2013.Combining the two telecom providers would have helped their majority shareholders as well. SoftBank has faced concerns from investors about how it would manage Sprint\u2019s debt load, while Deutsche Telekom has been concerned about the fate of its best-performing business asset.Both companies had been hoping that, unlike in 2014, a merger of the two would be looked upon more favorably this time around. The Obama administration had strongly hinted that it would fight to oppose a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, arguing that consolidation would hurt consumers. By contrast, the deal makers at both companies said that they believed the Trump administration would let a deal take place.Now, Sprint and T-Mobile will be left on their own to battle Verizon and AT&T \u2014 and each other. Executives from both companies appeared ready to wage that fight.\u201cWe are determined to continue our efforts to change the wireless industry and compete fiercely,\u201d Mr. Claure said in the joint statement. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to take the fight to the duopoly and newly emerging competitors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Memorial T-Shirts Create a Little Justice, a Tiny Peace", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 Quentin Harris lives in the Englewood neighborhood here, and each year he commissions designs by Big City Fashions as an instrumental part of the unending process of grieving his brother, Julian. When Julian was shot and killed, Mr. Harris was in prison, unable to attend the funeral. Now he wears a memorial shirt, a new one each year, for an annual celebration held in his brother\u2019s honor.This year, weather permitting, there would be a barbecue.Mr. Harris worries that his nephew, who will get a singular customized shirt, is too young to remember his father otherwise. Another sibling, born since his brother\u2019s death seven years ago, will know him only through this memorializing. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m giving him a second life,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cLike he\u2019ll never really be gone, as long as I can help it.\u201dBig City Fashions, near the intersection of East 75th Street and South Cottage Grove Avenue, is typical of the legion of boutique salons dotting Chicago\u2019s South Side. The broad windows are barred. A chained bulldog barks out back. The shop, nestled on a block with a grocer and a florist, has called this corner home for a bit more than 15 years. \u201cThat\u2019s about a generation,\u201d Carl Virgin, the owner, said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a generation come and go. You see them as babies, then they\u2019re grown with kids of their own, dead buddies of their own.\u201dMr. Virgin is bantamweight and possessed of a quiet demeanor that first reads as pensive. He has a full and jutting beard threaded with gray, the only aspect of his physical self that even hints at his 43 years. The bulk of his shop\u2019s business \u2014 \u201cAt least, like, 90 percent,\u201d according to Christian Ray, an employee and graffiti artist known as Arson \u2014 is commemorative T-shirts, or \u201cR.I.P. tees.\u201dThe standard commemorative T-shirt is a white crew neck that bears, in vibrant, idiosyncratic detail, the name and visage of the dead. These shirts are commissioned by mourners, typically to be worn at funerals or other memorial gatherings in the first days and weeks after a death. The afternoon sun doesn\u2019t reach the furthest corners of the shop, where the design equipment lives and where Mr. Ray and Mr. Virgin work, along with Jeremy Carnegan, a graphic designer, and two men named Lamont (one goes by \u201cSkee,\u201d the other, \u201cLA\u201d). The technical implements of their craft are artificially lit, with Mr. Ray weaving in and out of the harsh fluorescence as he works.The shop is part of a network of funerary proprietors between 75th and 79th Streets. Big City and its florist neighbor, along with a printer of funeral programs and the Leak and Sons Funeral Home, all black-owned, together ferry the bereaved through the process of mourning the newly dead. This is work that must be reconciled with the limitations of time and finance.\u201cMan, I\u2019m a graffiti artist, a therapist, a financial adviser, all that,\u201d Mr. Ray said. He became interested in airbrush design art as a teenager, when a teacher at Cregier High School handed him an airbrush gun during a mechanic class. He has now been an airbrush and graffiti artist for 22 years, splashing his work on different media, including cars, buildings and T-shirts.\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful art, but it\u2019s pretty morbid,\u201d he said. Often, the T-shirts he designs are for the very young, frequently victims of gun violence. \u201cI love airbrushing, I love graffiti, but I\u2019d rather make shirts to celebrate a graduation or a wedding, or, hell, even a picture of somebody\u2019s dog,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is what it is. It\u2019s tough.\u201dIn the early 2000s, the death of Aaliyah, followed by Lisa Lopes (known as Left Eye) and Jam Master Jay in quick succession, heralded a mini pop-culture renaissance of airbrushed designs worn as homage. Those designs seemed motivated by the challenges of hyperrealism, 100 percent airbrushed representations that, at first glance, seemed more photographic than painterly. It was around this time, in 2002, that Mr. Virgin, who opened the shop with his uncle, now deceased, met Mr. Ray.Over the years, the cut of the shirt has shrunk. The 100 percent cotton extra-tall tees of yore proved not ideal for airbrushing. The natural fibers hold but don\u2019t really absorb the paint, with the material remaining on the surface of the shirt in a way that leaves it prone to cracking and fading. Mr. Ray prefers lighter polyester blends, not tubular, with a crisp side seam to guide and bifurcate the shirt\u2019s front and back.Often, design sessions run into the night. Each shirt is a hybridized creation; Big City uses a combination of spray paint, sublimation (direct-to-garment printing), dyeing and screen printing. Heaven, and its symbolics, and the jagged Chicago skyline are most-requested motifs, and they are rendered with an almost rococo decadence. The scenes sprawl out behind the central photograph for a surrealist, multidimensional effect. On one shirt, the John Hancock building is interpreted with such precision that its famous x-bracing steel beams are visible.Mr. Carnegan, Big City\u2019s graphic designer, believes that the airbrushed design tribute is nearing an explosion. He said that the practice will go national and mainstream, \u201cin like 2 or 3 years.\u201d He is pessimistic about the implications of this for Big City. \u201cThey\u2019ll be in H&M maybe, or Zara. Somewhere where people can get them cheap and quick,\u201d he said.One of the perils of mourning in a cultural moment largely choreographed by social media is the slip into pageantry, with all the attendant competitiveness. \u201cSome of these kids, man, it\u2019s scary,\u201d Mr. Ray said. \u201cThey get T-shirts, dog tags, all types of memorabilia, their rooms and lockers look like shrines. It\u2019s like, I question whether that\u2019s healthy.\u201dThere is also the hazard of conferring affection for a person onto an object, something that is ephemeral; threads will unravel, paint will fade. Despite their own life spans, the shirts also function as a refutation of the supposed anonymity of gun violence. That number \u2014 of victims \u2014 is often deployed with a rote disregard, especially in relation to Chicago. The shirts serve as a declaration of the singularity of death as well as that of grief.In 2002, Karla F C Holloway, a professor at Duke University, wrote, of black \u201ccommemorative conduct\u201d: \u201cOur daily lives were so persistently interrupted by the specters of death that we worked this experience into the culture\u2019s iconography.\u201d She suggests that the open-coffin funeral and the street corner memorial point to a type of mourning, which was, out of necessity, constant and protracted.These practices, like memorial T-shirts, serve multiple aims. They are a memorial to both the deceased and to the ways they died. And all of these practices function as an indictment, where the law has provided none.Advertisement"}

What\u2019s indisputable is the spectrum of men who joined with the coalition of rural, immigrant, black and radical women who were at the forefront of the movement.Professor Kroeger\u2019s prodigiously researched book traces the role of men (who provided credibility to a movement financed by wealthy women) at least as far back as 1775, when Thomas Paine\u2019s essay, \u201cAn Occasional Letter on the Female Sex,\u201d was published.The \u201csuffragents\u201d included the writer Max Eastman, in whose Greenwich Village apartment members of the Men\u2019s League for Woman Suffrage in New York met; George Creel, the Wilson administration\u2019s chief government propagandist in World War I; the educator John Dewey; the sociologist and historian W. E. B. Du Bois; Representative Charles A. Lindbergh Sr. (father of the aviator); the journalist Oswald Garrison Villard; Rabbi Stephen S. Wise; and eventually the Tammany boss Charles F. Murphy.In 1915, after the first effort to amend the state constitution was soundly defeated, the Columbia historian Charles A. Beard urged the women\u2019s rights advocates to shift their tactics from moral persuasion to single-minded political organizing.\u201cI tell you 10,000 voters will have more effect upon a Congressman than all the angels,\u201d Beard said.By 1916, even President Woodrow Wilson had been persuaded by his daughters to support suffrage. \u201cA cause which could enlist the enthusiastic, devoted, idealistic support of such ladies must be wholesome,\u201d he said.The day before the vote, The Times published a final appeal by a leading suffragist, Carrie Chapman Catt, exhorting New Yorkers to reflect upon the fact that \u201cour country is fighting for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government. Vote for woman suffrage, because it is part of the great struggle toward democracy.\u201dOn Nov. 6, New York became the 14th state to grant women the right to vote, galvanizing the movement for a federal constitutional amendment.\u201cMay the experiment, if it is to be made, disappoint the fears and predictions of its adversaries,\u201d a Times editorial said begrudgingly. \u201cMay the women justify by their behavior their fitness for the ballot.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Its tensions with its northern neighbor, China, have persisted for thousands of years \u2014 from a millennium of direct Chinese rule and a bloody border war in 1979 to more recent confrontations in the South China Sea.If geography is destiny, then the fate of Vietnam is to be an expert in bargaining with Beijing and balancing between superpowers.\u201cI would like to give advice to the whole world, and especially to the United States, that you must be careful with China,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Le Van Cuong, the retired director of the Institute of Strategic Studies at the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security.\u201cXi Jinping\u2019s ambitions are dangerous for the whole world,\u201d General Cuong said. \u201cChina uses its money to buy off many leaders, but none of the countries that are its close allies, like North Korea, Pakistan or Cambodia, have done well. Countries that are close to America have done much better. We must ask: Why is this?\u201dAs with other Southeast Asian nations acutely aware that they are positioned in China\u2019s backyard, Vietnam is worried about American inattention.In the name of halting Communism, the United States once sent troops to Indochina and propped up dictators elsewhere in Asia. But the American-devised security landscape also created a stable environment in which regional economies expanded.Now, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to take the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, which would have given 11 other economies an alternative to a Chinese-led economic order, has left the Vietnamese feeling vulnerable.\u201cAs Vietnamese, we are always trying to find a way to balance China\u2019s power,\u201d said Nguyen Ngoc Anh, a professor at the Foreign Trade University in Hanoi. \u201cFor us, TPP isn\u2019t just an economic issue. It\u2019s also about geopolitics and social issues.\u201d\u201cWe are both Communist countries, but people like me in Vietnam don\u2019t want to develop the same way that China has,\u201d said Ms. Anh, who studied economics in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia. \u201cWe want to follow the Western-oriented way.\u201dWhile the United States is the largest market for Vietnamese exports, Vietnam\u2019s biggest trading partner is China. Yet Vietnam runs a significant trade deficit with its populous neighbor, and Vietnamese economists worry that China doesn\u2019t play fairly.\u201cChina is one of the few countries in the world that doesn\u2019t observe international law in many areas,\u201d said Le Dang Doanh, an influential economist who has advised members of the Vietnamese Politburo on trade.But this national aversion puts Vietnam\u2019s leadership in a bind. It cannot ignore China\u2019s growing economic magnetism.

Thailand has complied with Beijing\u2019s demand that it return Chinese dissidents who once counted on it as a haven.Since taking office last year, Mr. Duterte has deemed the era of American military and economic pre-eminence over, and has called China his country\u2019s best and faithful friend. He has been rewarded with billions of dollars in infrastructure investment from Beijing.\u201cThe U.S. has been playing catch-up to China\u2019s charm offensive since the turn of the new century,\u201d said Tang Siew Mun, who heads the Southeast Asia center at the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore.Vietnam, more than any other country, has grown practiced at divining when not to challenge the two Pacific powers \u2014 both of which it fought within the last half-century.In the 1970s and 1980s, China seized spits of land in the South China Sea that Vietnam had controlled or that were unoccupied but claimed by Hanoi.Yet perhaps sensing an American reluctance to confront China in the South China Sea, Vietnam has declined to take China to international court, as the Philippines did, even as the Chinese have turned disputed reefs and sandbars into militarized islands.Chinese pressure continues, despite the United States\u2019 supplying the Vietnamese Coast Guard with a cutter and new patrol boats.\u201cLiving next to China, which has ambitions to become the most powerful country in the world, is not easy,\u201d said Vo Van Tao, a popular political blogger. \u201cTo lower the heat, Vietnam needs to withdraw from areas that belong to Vietnam.\u201dGrand strategy is beyond the worldview of Vietnamese like Do Van Duc.

Within a month, the Chinese, professing that they had taught the Vietnamese a lesson for interfering in regional geopolitics, withdrew.During the war with China, Mr. Duc was only 17 years old, but he came to understand one thing then that today, as a security guard living in Hanoi, he said he still clings to.\u201cWe cannot trust the Chinese,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are our ancient enemy, and that will not change.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified two ships shown in the South China Sea.

{"Headline": "With Obamacare Fight Lost, Conservatives Turn to Veterans\u2019 Care", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With their hopes of repealing the Affordable Care Act dashed for now, deep-pocketed conservative activists have turned their attention to a smaller but still potent new effort: allowing private health care to compete with Veterans Affairs hospitals for the patronage of the nation\u2019s veterans.Concerned Veterans for America, a little-known advocacy group backed by the conservative billionaire industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch, is pressing Republicans to make it easier for veterans to see private doctors at government expense. The group\u2019s voice had been lonely until recently, when a raft of Koch-connected advocacy organizations and other conservative allies joined the effort.That has in many cases pitted conservative advocates against congressionally chartered, old-line groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion that have long guarded the Veterans Affairs system that they helped build.\u201cWe actually have members that guide our advocacy and our voice as opposed to a small partisan think tank of ideologues,\u201d said Louis Celli, the national director of veterans affairs and rehabilitation for the American Legion. \u201cWe get our voice from our two-million-person membership base that actually use V.A. services and tell us what they are looking for.\u201dDan Caldwell, the executive director of Concerned Veterans, pushed back, citing the Koch group\u2019s volunteer membership numbers and the influence of veterans in its network.\u201cWhat, in effect, those people are saying is that the military service of our staff and our members and our ideas mean less than theirs simply because we don\u2019t have a congressional charter and we don\u2019t wear hats,\u201d he said.The relative newcomers to the world of veterans policy see in the debate an opportunity to advance their campaign against government-provided medical care. Together, they have pledged millions of dollars for advertising and outreach, and have unleashed a small army of lobbyists and donors to pressure the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers.Their efforts come as lawmakers on Capitol Hill are crafting legislation that could drastically reshape the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Veterans Health Administration, a multibillion-dollar health system that provides care to nearly nine million veterans each year. They are hoping to complete their work before the end of the year, when a key agency program is set to run out of money.With Republicans in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, the Koch-funded efforts have already succeeded in disrupting the consensus-driven veterans community, where policy discussions have long been dominated by congressionally chartered veterans groups.Those groups still have significant clout with lawmakers, and in many cases they have largely banded together to critique the Koch-driven proposal, which they fear would effectively dismantle the agency they have built up over decades. At least one left-leaning veterans advocacy group, VoteVets, has also joined them, pledging to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to oppose privatization.Representative Phil Roe, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said he was committed to moving bipartisan legislation and would engage with \u201call stakeholders with serious ideas.\u201dBut Representative Tim Walz of Minnesota, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, said Concerned Veterans for America should not be underestimated, particularly with its links to the White House and with other well-connected conservative groups waiting for a chance to take on a relatively popular government health care program.\u201cI don\u2019t underestimate the Kochs one bit. It is brilliant what they are trying to do,\u201d Mr. Walz said. \u201cThey are as close to this White House and to the secretary as anyone.\u201d\u201cThis has been a yearslong sustained campaign to reform and fix the V.A.,\u201d Mr. Caldwell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve really strongly advocated for three core reforms: accountability, making it easier to fire and discipline bad employees; choice, giving veterans more control over their health care; and transparency, making the V.A. share more information with the public in terms of how it\u2019s performing.\u201dNow, Concerned Veterans wants legislators to go further, giving veterans the last say over where to use the health benefits they earn for years of service.It is also better positioned. President Trump has spoken favorably of letting veterans choose. The group\u2019s former executive director was considered to be Veterans Affairs secretary. Another senior adviser was given a top position there before moving over to the White House. And Marc Short, the White House\u2019s legislative director, is a former top Koch lieutenant.The latest push was a natural fit to activate other Koch groups, including Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners, according to a representative of the network, who asked for anonymity to discuss the group\u2019s plans. The network plans to spend liberally from its $300 million to $400 million policy and politics budget for the year, financing outreach to activists, lobbying and direct advertising.That campaign has disturbed many of the old-line veterans groups, which argue that their privileged place in advising lawmakers is protected for a reason. Concerned Veterans and other advocacy groups working alongside it take directions from wealthy donors, they say, not veterans.The old-line veterans groups and lawmakers from both parties supported the creation of the Choice program and largely agree that the agency\u2019s health programs need reorganization. The House committee was set to vote on bipartisan legislation on Wednesday that would allow agency doctors to decide with the veteran when it was in a veteran\u2019s best interest to seek private care \u2014 because a nearby government facility either was overburdened or could not provide specialty care.The vote was ultimately postponed over cost concerns.Republicans and conservative groups would prefer new spending be at least partly offset by cost savings and other cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Democrats and the old-line veterans groups say they are unlikely to support a plan unless it makes simultaneous investments in the agency\u2019s own capacity. Without it, they argue, the problems that have necessitated private care in the first place will only fester.\u201cThis is starve the beast to the point that it can\u2019t function situation,\u201d Mr. Walz said of the latter plan, \u201cbecause if you don\u2019t do this, the complaints against the V.A. are going to increase exponentially. The wait lists are going to increase. And then they are going to say, \u2018See, we need more outside care.\u2019\u201dMr. Caldwell said the House bill did not go far enough. The government, he argued, would still have too much control of veterans\u2019 health choices. His group and its allies will keep fighting for a more ambitious reshaping of Veterans Affairs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Trade, Trump Puts Corporate America First", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe latest round of North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations came to an end last week without a deal. It\u2019s not clear whether a compromise will be reached or President Trump will make good on his threat of pulling out. But we have seen enough of his approach to trade to know it is fundamentally mistaken and counterproductive.Mr. Trump is not wrong to think that trade agreements have shortchanged America as a whole while enriching corporate and financial interests. He was right to walk away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that was less about free trade and more about special privileges for investors, large companies and pharmaceutical businesses.Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on the bilateral trade deficit with Mexico is also a red herring. The overall trade deficit of the United States is determined primarily by macroeconomic factors \u2014 American consumers\u2019 saving propensities, domestic corporations\u2019 investment behavior and the federal government\u2019s fiscal and monetary policies. Trade policies with Mexico can do very little to alter this picture.But the biggest flaw of this administration\u2019s trade policy is that it falls squarely within the pervasive established mercantilist tradition. For mercantilists, the purpose of trade agreements is to open up other countries\u2019 economies to our companies to the maximum extent possible while minimizing how much we open up ours. Everybody else must adjust how their economy works, while we maintain our own ways. Under the guise of fairness to workers as a whole, this approach equates national interest with the profit-seeking behavior of United States corporations or protectionist groups.When trade agreements focused mostly on tariff and non-tariff barriers at the border, mercantilism produced some salutary consequences. Reaching agreement would require the United States to reduce its tariffs in return for other countries reducing theirs. International trade would be freer as a result.But today\u2019s trade deals are largely about domestic regulations and standards \u2014 the behind-the-border rules that purportedly stifle international commerce and investment. Mercantilism no longer has much of a silver lining. It now translates simply into investors and corporations getting their wish list fulfilled with the removal of any and all impediments to their cross-border activities.Of all the special interests that have shaped recent trade agreements, none has been as energetic in its lobbying, or more successful, than the pharmaceutical sector. A result has been the inclusion of ever stringent patent rules in trade agreements since the 1990s. Historically, patent laws have been enacted as an inducement to innovation, yet economists are increasingly skeptical that strong patents are necessary for that purpose. Euphemistically called \u201ctrade-related intellectual property rights,\u201d these protections serve mainly to transfer monopoly profits from global consumers to patent holders in the United States.Mr. Trump does pay lip service to upholding labor and environmental standards, which were shifted to side agreements in the original Nafta negotiations. But he has little interest in domestic policies that would really help those hurt by trade.A truly fairer globalization would start at home, with a reconstruction of the social compact that binds the corporate elite and the wealthy to labor and the middle class. Every society that opens itself up to the world economy needs social transfers, labor-training programs and regional policies that take care of the adversely affected workers and communities. Our domestic approach, over-reliant on underfunded and ineffective trade-adjustment assistance policies, has not worked and needs to be replaced by more extensive safety nets.These must be complemented with more progressive income taxation, employment-generating policies such as infrastructure investment and political reforms that reduce the role of money in politics. Mr. Trump and the Republicans want to take us in exactly the opposite direction, with a tax reform that will benefit the wealthy first and foremost.The problem with Mr. Trump\u2019s economic nationalism is not his avowed belief that trade should serve the national interest. When we economists teach the theory of trade, we emphasize that free trade is desirable because it expands the domestic economic pie \u2014 not because it confers gains to other nations. The problem is that he is deeply averse to the domestic policies that would allow American workers a piece of the added pie.International fairness in turn would require us to recognize that all countries have legitimate reasons to value their national sovereignty. Rules for finance or intellectual property that, for good or ill, prevail in the United States will frequently be unsuited to other countries. Our trade policy should not be driven by big banks and pharma companies that show very little concern for such considerations.Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to distance himself from special-interest globalization is perhaps not surprising. But it exposes the vacuity of his brand of populism. Despite all his talk about fairness and the need to stand up for ordinary working people, he has little to offer his core constituency. He will exacerbate, rather than mend, the grievances that made his presidency possible.Dani Rodrik is a professor of international political economy at the Harvard Kennedy School and the author of \u201cStraight Talk on Trade: Ideas for a Sane World Economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Inquiry Fails to Unite a Nation", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorIn a buck-stops-with-us moment, they were resolute about doing better. And they were contrite \u2014 even the Fox News founder and chief executive, Roger Ailes, a famous bully who rarely shied from a fight.\u201cWe let our viewers down,\u201d Mr. Ailes said. \u201cIt will not happen again.\u201dThe networks were on the hot seat because their election-night coverage had contributed to the chaos of that shambolic evening. They declared Al Gore the winner in Florida before all of the state\u2019s polls were closed \u2014 and then they called it for George W. Bush, although the results remained in doubt for weeks.In the months that followed, the news organizations agreed on the basic facts, if not on every detail. And under bipartisan pressure from Congress, they moved swiftly to fix their flawed election-night projection system.Look at us now. As the country grapples with a still more serious affront to American democracy, the agreement on the basic facts in the mainstream news media does not extend to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire and other important parts of the conservative media.This is the case even as the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III bears down in his investigation of the alleged Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election.As Mr. Mueller and his team home in on people connected to President Trump, including his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, the president and his allies in the conservative media sphere are pointing at the Democrats and Hillary Clinton.The opacity of the tech companies was matched by the efforts of some conservative media outlets to confuse and distract.In the days leading up to the indictment of Mr. Manafort and his lobbying partner Rick Gates, they saw fit to question Mr. Mueller\u2019s legitimacy. They did so while arguing that the real focus should be on Mrs. Clinton, the Democrats and a political research firm that commissioned the gathering of information on Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, Fusion GPS.The counternarrative was particularly pronounced in the outlets controlled by Mr. Murdoch \u2014 who has close ties to the president\u2019s family \u2014 and his news and entertainment companies, 21st Century Fox and News Corp.Foreshadowing Mr. Goodwin\u2019s dubious argument was an editorial in the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal, which declared that Mr. Mueller \u201clacks the critical distance\u201d to look into the allegation that \u201cDemocrats paid for Russians to compile wild allegations about a U.S. presidential candidate.\u201d The editorial also questioned whether the dossier had triggered the F.B.I. inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.And while skepticism is a virtue in all journalistic endeavors, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the Democrats hired Fusion GPS with the purpose of getting Russians to spread \u201cwild allegations\u201d about Mr. Trump.As John Sipher, a former Central Intelligence Agency chief of station, pointed out, intelligence tends to come from sources within foreign governments.\u201cReaching out to Russians and Americans to try to collect information on what might have happened and then pass that information to sources in good faith, that\u2019s different from trying to conspire with Russia to get stolen emails from the United States,\u201d Mr. Sipher told me.The collective coverage from The Journal editorial page, The New York Post and Fox News \u2014 not including the straight-ahead coverage by the likes of Shepard Smith and Bret Baier \u2014 was testament to the Murdoch empire\u2019s ability to make its own journalistic weather.Between the promotion of alternative narratives and the way the social media platforms have been so slow in describing their inadvertent hosting of the Russian effort, there\u2019s a striking lack of national unity over what appears to have been a foreign incursion in an American election. So you have to wonder how the country will ever come together to do something about it.\u201cThere\u2019s this epic lack of consensus, or active dis-census,\u201d said Shawn Powers, the executive director of the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, who has spent years studying what he calls the \u201cgeopolitics of information.\u201dMr. Powers was confident that, as the facts come out, the country will find a way to fend off similar attacks. For instance, he said, Facebook, Twitter and Google are adding new policies to combat false information, fake accounts and nefarious foreign political advertising.But I can\u2019t help thinking back to 2001.On Tuesday, I called Tom Johnson, the former CNN chairman, who was one of the executives who appeared on Capitol Hill to testify in 2001. He said some colleagues had some qualms appearing before Congress, given the First Amendment implications. But he told me that he had felt it was the right thing to do.\u201cI still think we have the very highest public responsibility to make sure we get it right and, when we don\u2019t get it right, that we try to determine what went wrong and what we can do about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really gets down to operating in the public interest.\u201dOh, yeah, that.Jaclyn Peiser contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil Becomes Uber\u2019s Latest Regulatory Battleground", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrazilian lawmakers last week moved ahead on a bill that, as originally proposed, would have imposed licensing requirements that Uber said would cripple its model. But a last-minute lobbying blitz by the company, including a trip here by its new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, appeared to have paid off.The Senate tacked on amendments that significantly watered down the regulatory burdens. That kicked the legislation back to the House \u2014 and gave the company time to fight an effort by taxi unions to drive it and other app-based services out of the market.In the coming weeks, Uber expects to lobby members of the House to sign off on the amendments, which the company\u2019s spokesman, Fabio Sabba, called \u201ceffective regulation\u201d and no longer a \u201cveiled prohibition.\u201d It is not clear how soon the House will take up the measure.On the eve of Tuesday\u2019s vote in the Senate, Uber drivers protested by blocking roads, paralyzing parts of Bras\u00edlia, the capital, and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s financial hub. The company took out prime-time ads on Globo, Brazil\u2019s main television station, and arranged meetings between Mr. Khosrowshahi and senior Brazilian officials, including Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles.Uber has elbowed its way into important markets in Latin America, including Colombia and Chile, where its model is unregulated. The company and a handful of rivals have developed a loyal following, but their growth has been met with crackdowns by the authorities and protests by taxi drivers. Chilean lawmakers are considering a regulatory bill.Mr. Khosrowshahi signaled in the interview that Uber was open to some regulation in Brazil. But he said the original bill would have \u201cdrastically\u201d reduced the number of Uber drivers in Brazil, currently 500,000. According to the company, Uber has more than 17 million users in Brazil.The Senate amendments did away with requirements that drivers own their vehicles and obtain a special license plate that is notoriously hard to get in some cities.Other provisions \u2014 including one allowing municipal inspection of vehicles \u2014 were left intact.Uber\u2019s more conciliatory approach in Brazil comes after a bruising loss in London, where officials declined to renew its license. The agency overseeing subways, buses and taxis declared that the company was not sufficiently \u201cfit and proper.\u201dIn a full-page ad, Khosrowshahi apologized to Londoners \u201cfor the mistakes we\u2019ve made\u201d and in a letter to employees said \u201cthe truth is that there is a high cost to a bad reputation.\u201dAhead of the Senate vote, hundreds of taxi drivers and Uber drivers faced off in tense protests in front of Congress. In a sign of how heated the debate has become, Mr. Sabba, the company\u2019s director of communications in Brazil, was punched in the face by a taxi driver while speaking to journalists.In urging regulation, taxi drivers say they just want to level the playing field.Mariana Santana, a taxi driver in S\u00e3o Paulo, said she had comfortably supported herself and her sister until the ride-hailing services came along. Then, last year, her daily take-home wage dropped to $45 from about $100. She now sells cosmetics on the side to make up for the lost income.\u201cThat\u2019s Uber\u2019s fault,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like their drivers are making more. The apps are the ones making all the money. That\u2019s why regulation is so urgent.\u201dIndependent drivers say the app services have been a lifeline during the country\u2019s financial crisis.\u201cI think there needs to be more regulation \u2014 and safety for drivers and passengers,\u201d said Daniele Perini, a full-time driver who responds to calls from 99, Uber and Lady Driver. \u201cBut that bill wasn\u2019t about regulation, it was about getting rid of us.\u201dShasta Darlington reported from S\u00e3o Paulo, and Ernesto Londo\u00f1o from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Simple Fix for Our Massive Inequality Problem", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEveryone knows that we are again living in a Gilded Age.More controversial is the question of what should be done about it. We seem stuck in the same policy equilibrium we have been in for decades, with conservatives denying that there is a problem and pushing policies that would make it even worse, liberals emphasizing the need for education and skills development, and leftists pushing for a unionized labor market and social-democratic welfare state.Some of these ideas are good ones, which would make life better for vulnerable people. But they\u2019d do little to directly target inequality in our society or to capture all the benefits that economic fairness brings.The solution is simpler than it seems. There\u2019s a tried and tested way, within the system we have now, of giving everyone a share in the investment returns now hoarded by the wealthy. It\u2019s called a social wealth fund, a pool of investment assets in some ways like the giant index or mutual funds already popular with retirement savings accounts or pension funds, but one owned collectively by society as a whole. One that paid dividends not to the few, or even just to the shrinking middle class lucky enough to have their savings invested, but to everyone.Here\u2019s how it could work. The federal government would create and run a new investment fund, and issue every adult citizen one share of ownership. The fund would gradually come to own a substantial and diverse portfolio of stocks, bonds and real estate. The investment return that the fund generates would be paid out to each citizen in the form of a universal basic dividend, and the shares would be nontransferable to preserve the institution\u2019s egalitarian purpose.The key challenge in building a social wealth fund is not how to run it once it has been created, but how to bring assets into the fund in the first place. Alaska and Norway were able to dedicate the proceeds from natural resource exploitation to that purpose, but most governments seeking to duplicate their efforts would need to look elsewhere for the money.Wouldn\u2019t the enormous wealth that our increasingly productive society is generating, which now flows into just a few pockets, be a fair source? Some of the concrete ways this could happen are through the transfer of existing federal assets like land, buildings and portions of the wireless spectrum into the new fund. Other measures could include increases in taxes on capital that affect mostly the wealthy such as estate, dividend and financial transaction taxes and the creation of a new type of corporate tax that requires companies to directly issue new shares to the social wealth fund on an annual basis and during certain corporate moves such as initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions.Creating a social wealth fund in which we all own an equal part is certainly not the only way to tackle wealth inequality directly, but it is one of the few ways that we know works well and is able to work within the system we now have. If policymakers want to get serious about trimming wealth concentration, and not just use these shocking statistics to promote the same old half-measures, then this would be a fair, effective and practical way to start.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Offers Bond Swap in a Charge Toward Financial Freedom", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreece, long the problem child of the eurozone, took a major step on Wednesday toward securing financial independence as it prepares to wean itself off the international bailouts that have kept it afloat for the last eight years.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras yearns for the day he is able to regularly sell Greek bonds to foreign investors, thus cutting the country\u2019s ties to financial lifelines. That would also have the effect of helping persuade the European Central Bank to buy Greek bonds as part of its huge regional stimulus program \u2014 something the bank has refused to do for years \u2014 and further improve Greece\u2019s finances.\u201cThe return to capital markets is part of the belated success story narrative that the Greek government together with the European Central Bank and the European Commission are trying to create,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economics consultant based in Athens and a former member of the European Commission\u2019s task force on Greece.The initial bonds were issued after a 2012 restructuring of Greek debt that forced private investors to take significant losses. The new bonds will most likely be more liquid \u2014 and easier to buy and sell \u2014 creating more incentive for big Wall Street investors like Pimco and Franklin Templeton to buy them.The swap will only work, however, if the existing bondholders agree to sell. The Greek government set a deadline of Nov. 28 for offers.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Still, the offer has already had an effect. As news of the swap seeped into financial markets, Greece\u2019s bond yields have come down sharply, to around 5 percent \u2014 a long way from the 22-plus percent rates that investors required the government to pay out because of the risk of buying its bonds at the height of the crisis. As a result, the country may be able to borrow at relatively low interest rates in the future.At present, a calmer climate has returned to Greece after years of financial drama, attracting the attention of investors. American companies and financial firms in particular have intensified their searching for deals as the Greek economy has shown signs of stabilizing.Yet despite interest by international investors in the possibility of reaping rich rewards from investing in Greek debt, the country\u2019s economy continues to struggle, Mr. Bastian said, adding that the success story narrative is \u201coverstated.\u201dLast week, the Greek finance ministry lowered its economic growth projection for this year from 1.8 percent to 1.6 percent. Unemployment has declined \u2014 from 27 percent at the height of the crisis to 21 percent today \u2014 but it is still the worst in the 19-nation eurozone.Banks are still loath to lend, and nonperforming loans on banks\u2019 balance sheets continue to block a recovery, Mr. Bastian said. That has had an outsize impact on small- and medium-sized businesses, which are the motor of the Greek economy.And for average Greeks still struggling to recover from years of hardship, this latest maneuver to please Greece\u2019s foreign creditors held little meaning.Mania Kouvari, 46, a teacher at a Greek state school, saw the bond issue as an attempt to distract public opinion from the fact that Greeks remain largely under foreign supervision \u2014 recent tranches of bailout funds have required, as a condition, painful austerity to be passed by Parliament \u2014 and indebted to international powers.\u201cThey are trying to show a positive image so that people invest in Greece and everything looks normal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut under the surface things aren\u2019t normal. People are struggling.\u201dMs. Kouvari said her own salary had been cut three times over the past seven years and that one of her two children was unemployed. \u201cIs that a success story?\u201d she said.Stelios Arvanitis, 68, a retiree, said his grandchildren were \u201cworking for peanuts.\u201d\u201cThey have no real future here,\u201d he said \u201cAnd then the government tells us about bonds. It has no bearing on our lives. And we\u2019re still going to be in debt for years to come.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis and Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

They caught both the kingdom\u2019s richest investor, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, and the most potent remaining rival to the crown prince\u2019s power: Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, a favored son of the late King Abdullah.Prince Mutaib had been removed from his post as chief of a major security service just hours before the arrests announced late Saturday night.All members of the royal family were barred from leaving the country, American officials tracking the developments said on Sunday.With the new detentions, Crown Prince Mohammed, King Salman\u2019s favored son and key adviser, now appears to have established control over all three Saudi security services \u2014 the military, internal security services and national guard. For decades they had been distributed among branches of the House of Saud clan to preserve a balance of power in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East\u2019s biggest oil producer and an important American ally.In the same stroke, the crown prince has cowed businessmen and royals across the kingdom by taking down the undisputed giant of Saudi finance. And over the last several weeks he has ordered enough high-profile arrests of intellectuals and clerics to frighten the remainder of the academic and religious establishment into acceding to his will as well.Apolitical scholars who used to speak freely in cafes now look nervously over their shoulders, as Crown Prince Mohammed has achieved a degree of dominance that no ruler has attained for generations.\u201cIt is the coup de gr\u00e2ce of the old system,\u201d said Chas W. Freeman, a former United States ambassador. \u201cGone. All power has now been concentrated in the hands of Mohammed bin Salman.\u201dWhy the crown prince acted now \u2014 whether to eliminate future opposition or perhaps to crush some threat he saw brewing \u2014 was not immediately clear.Saudi Arabian businessmen and royals anxious about the crown prince\u2019s plans were quietly moving assets out of the country even before the arrests.\u201cSome of these are businessmen with international status, and if they are caught in this web then it could happen to anyone,\u201d said James M. Dorsey, who studies Saudi Arabia at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \u201cHow is that going to inspire confidence and attract foreign investment?\u201dThe Saudi Arabian news media, however, celebrated the arrests as a long-awaited cleanup, appealing to populist resentment of self-enrichment enjoyed by the sprawling royal family and its closest allies.Almost everyone in the capital, Riyadh, and other big cities like Jidda has heard stories about princes absconding with vast sums that had been allocated for a public project.The arrests are \u201ca frontal assault on some members of the royal family and the impunity with which they have operated in the past,\u201d said Bernard Haykel, a professor at Princeton University who studies Saudi Arabia.\u201cIt was something that had to be done,\u201d he said, even though the absence of a judicial process \u201csends a chill down the spine of foreign investors.\u201dThree White House advisers, including the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, returned just days ago from the latest in at least three high-level Trump administration visits to Saudi Arabia this year.Nearly 24 hours after the arrests were announced, no Saudi authority or spokesman had identified those arrested or the charges against them.The Saudi-owned satellite network Al Arabiya reported only that a large number of arrests, including 11 princes, had been ordered by an \u201canticorruption committee\u201d that just hours earlier had been formed under the direction of Crown Prince Mohammed. A royal decree granted the committee powers to detain individuals or seize assets without any trial, process or disclosure.A list of those arrested began circulating over social media shortly after midnight Sunday, and by Sunday evening senior government officials were reposting the list. News organizations around the region were reporting its contents without contradiction by either the Saudi government or individuals.In the case of the most politically potent of the detainees, the former security chief Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the Saudi government appeared on Sunday to have started a social media campaign seeking to make him the new face of public corruption.Analysts said the list appeared to reflect individuals with a reputation for self-enrichment and those representing rival power centers within the kingdom. Others included the power broker who once ran the royal court under King Abdullah, and the owner of one of the biggest private media companies in the region.But another was a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed himself \u2014 Adel Fakeih \u2014 who had been considered a driving force behind the ambitious program of economic reform, leaving analysts puzzled about the motives.The history of the House of Saud was sometimes punctuated by violent intrafamily strife in the decades before the founding of the modern dynasty, in 1932. Since then, the family has maintained its unity in part by spreading its top government roles and vast oil wealth among different branches of the sprawling clan. Most important was the division of the three main security services, which constitute the hard power on the ground.Michael Stephens, who studies Saudi Arabia at the Royal United Services Institute in London, recalled the bloody purges other leaders in the region have sometimes used to eliminate rivals. What Crown Prince Mohammed was doing, Mr. Stephens said, \u201cis a more genteel way of making sure there are no challenges to your power.\u201dTime will tell, Mr. Stephens said, whether the arrests signal a slide into despotism or \u201cwhether we will look back and say Mohammed bin Salman is the one guy who saw the wall coming and managed to hurdle it.\u201dReporting was contributed by Declan Walsh from Cairo, Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow, Ben Hubbard from Marib, Yemen, Nicholas Kulish from New York, Eric Schmitt from Washington and Mark Landler from Tokyo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "He Raised Drug Prices at Eli Lilly. Can He Lower Them for the U.S.?", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Alex M. Azar II, President Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has expressed concern about the soaring cost of prescription drugs for many consumers. This week, Mr. Azar, a former pharmaceutical executive, is expected to face tough questions at a Senate confirmation hearing over why his own company raised prices.Democratic senators say that, as a top manager at Eli Lilly and Company, he was responsible for steep increases on insulin and other drugs. How he would now tackle that problem as secretary, along with the future of the Affordable Care Act, promises to dominate the hearings.And Mr. Azar has struck a conciliatory tone as the public outcry over pharmaceutical prices has grown.\u201cLet\u2019s start by saying, \u2018We have a problem,\u2019\u201d he said at a pharmaceutical industry conference in May.Mr. Azar, 50, would bring an unusual combination of experience in government and industry to the job of running a cabinet department that spends more than a trillion dollars a year providing health insurance to more than 130 million Americans.His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is studded with conservative credentials. He was active in the Federalist Society and was a Supreme Court law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia, whom he describes as \u201cone of the 10 greatest figures in the history of Anglo-American law.\u201d He spent two years working for Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton. He worked on the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2000 and provided legal support for vote recount efforts in Florida.Mr. Azar, who describes himself as a policy wonk, joined the administration of President George W. Bush as general counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services in 2001 and became deputy secretary four years later.He helped devise the legal rationale for a complicated compromise on the emotional issue of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. And he helped carry out a 2003 law that added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, one of the most significant changes in the history of the program.Work on Medicare was a formative experience for Mr. Azar, and he cites the drug benefit \u2014 delivered entirely by private companies under contract with the government \u2014 as a model. The cost to Medicare beneficiaries and to taxpayers has been substantially less than originally projected.Mr. Azar (rhymes with \u201cpay czar\u201d) joined Lilly in 2007 and worked there for nearly 10 years before he left the Indianapolis-based company in January of this year.Lilly\u2019s portfolio includes Cialis, for men with erectile dysfunction; Forteo, for osteoporosis; and Zyprexa, for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. But its best sellers are insulin and other products for the treatment of diabetes.Patients and members of Congress criticized increases in list prices for insulin while Mr. Azar was the president of Lilly USA, the company\u2019s largest affiliate, which is responsible for more than 40 percent of its global revenue.\u201cThe price of insulin has tripled in the last decade,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. \u201cIf you want to bring down drug prices, you don\u2019t put a former pharmaceutical company executive in charge of health care policy for our country.\u201dMr. Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to lower drug prices, but Democrats say his words have not been matched by action.\u201cWe need an H.H.S. secretary who is willing to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices, not one who has financially benefited from this greed,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.The Senate Finance Committee plans to hold a separate confirmation hearing soon.In a letter to the health committee, the Type 1 Diabetes Defense Foundation, a nonprofit group, said that Mr. Azar had condoned Lilly\u2019s \u201coverpricing of insulin\u201d and that some patients had suffered as a result. In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the past seven months, Lilly said it had received demands for information about the pricing of its insulin products from offices of the attorneys general in California, Florida, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington State.Drug companies have long said high prices are not a concern because they provide big discounts and rebates on many products. But in the last year, as public outcry has grown, Mr. Azar has acknowledged a problem.\u201cThis is not something to put our head in the sand about,\u201d he told the industry conference in May. \u201cPatients are having to pay too much for drugs.\u201d In particular, he said, \u201cpatients are paying out of pocket too much money.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked. \u201cWas there in the last three years a radical change in the pricing of drugs \u2014 either how launch prices occur or how drug price increases happen? No. In the last five to seven years, the pricing model really has not changed one bit.\u201d\u201cSo why did things erupt?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey erupted because we have seen a complete and fundamental restructuring of health insurance in the United States over the last three to five years. More of us now have high-deductible plans. More of us now have high cost-sharing.\u201dAs a result, he said, \u201cwhen the patient goes into the pharmacy, they\u2019re getting the sticker, they\u2019re getting the list price.\u201dAt a symposium at the Manhattan Institute last November, Mr. Azar said, \u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of a golden age of pharmaceutical breakthroughs.\u201d But he added, \u201cOur outdated system for paying for prescription drugs is threatening to squelch patient access to this recent and revolutionary burst of innovation by shifting a crushing burden directly onto individuals.\u201dEven as drug companies increase list prices, they have been giving larger discounts and rebates to health insurance companies and the middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, who work for insurers and employers. But consumers who are uninsured or who have high-deductible health plans often must pay the full list price, or close to it.\u201cNo patient was ever supposed to pay those list prices, but in recent years a growing number have been forced to do exactly that,\u201d Mr. Azar said, adding, \u201cThat practice exposes patients to huge amounts of cost-sharing when they walk into the pharmacy.\u201dAnd that, he said, is bad for patients because they are much less likely to fill prescriptions if their out-of-pocket cost is more than $50 or $100.He said the current, convoluted system of paying for drugs had perverse incentives.\u201cAll players \u2014 wholesalers like McKesson and Cardinal, pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens, pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, and drug companies \u2014 make more money when list prices increase,\u201d Mr. Azar said, adding, \u201cThe unfortunate victims of these trends are patients.\u201dMr. Azar echoes Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of the Affordable Care Act. He maintains that the expansion of Medicaid under the law has not been successful. He speaks favorably of proposals to give each state a lump sum of federal money in the form of a block grant to provide health care to low-income people.And he said he wanted to \u201cget H.H.S. out of the business of being the nation\u2019s insurance commissioner.\u201dAsked on the Fox Business Network in May if the health law was dead, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly circling the drain.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans Wonder How to Make the Rich Richer", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs it stands now, the proposed House tax bill would give the undeserving rich \u2014 legatees who will inherit multimillion dollar estates \u2014 a $172.2 billion tax break over the next ten years. In doing so, the measure would further entrench the super rich, a class that in recent years has acquired a growing share of both income and wealth.Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2013 to 2017, emailed his response to my inquiry about the impact of the bill on households with different incomes:The House tax bill would lead to substantial redistribution from the middle-class to high-income households. Moreover, the particular form of the high-income tax cuts is designed to reward and perpetuate wealth in several respects. Much of the corporate rate cut would provide a windfall for the returns on capital investments that have already been made. Going forward, much of the effect of the plan would be to reduce the tax on monopoly rents \u2014 often to negative effective rates which means taxpayers would be subsidizing corporations.estate tax repeal would have eliminated. This would mean that not only are estates not taxed but that much of capital gains could permanently escape taxation, substantially increasing dynastic wealth accumulation.While proposing to eliminate the estate tax altogether, the House bill would retain a provision in current law \u2014 the step-up in basis \u2014 that effectively wipes out all tax liability for heirs on the increased value of assets at the time of death. Forbes declared, \u201cthis is a tax cut for the rich,\u201d and described what would happen using the step-up in basis if you died with an estate that had grown in value from $10 million to $100 million:There would be no estate tax, and your heirs could sell the stock right after your death and owe no capital gains taxes on the $90 million gain.Many of the very richest Americans have children who stand to benefit enormously if the proposed tax bill is enacted. The list of these billionaires includes Mark Zuckerberg, Michael Bloomberg, Larry Ellison, Charles Koch, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Phil Knight, Carl Icahn, Pierre Omidyar, David Koch, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, Sheldon Adelson, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, George Soros, and, of course, Donald Trump.repealing the tax would give about 330 estates (which are each worth more than $50 million) each a tax cut averaging more than $20 million compared to current law.The estate-tax provisions in the proposed bill are explicitly designed to help preserve and protect the assets of the wealthiest Americans. And despite their stated purpose, the corporate tax breaks in the legislation will not encourage new investment, according to many economists, but will instead reduce the taxes due on existing investments.Alan Krueger, a professor of economics at Princeton who was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2011 to 2013, put the case against the Republican tax bill succinctly in an email:Several components of the House bill favor physical and financial capital over labor and human capital \u2014 namely, the lower rate for passive pass through income, the repeal of the estate tax, the big cut in the corporate tax rate, the failure to end the carried interest loophole, etc. At the same time, the tax on university endowments and treatment of grad student fellowships will slow human capital investment.If enacted, these features of the proposal would also deepen and further entrench existing class divisions and reduce economic mobility.One of the biggest obstacles facing critics of the tax bill is that laws governing taxation are extremely complex. The description of the bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation is 299-pages long and it details only the bill\u2019s provisions, without any discussion of possible economic consequences. Crucial provisions governing arcane but crucial matters like carried interest, step-up in basis, pass-through corporations and passive investments are inherently opaque.In an effort to inform the public, the Joint Committee and the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center have released charts and analyses explaining who benefits and who loses by income class. Both the committee and the center challenge Republican claims that the main goal of the legislation is to give the middle class a tax break.The largest cuts, in dollars and as a percentage of after-tax income, would accrue to higher-income households. However, not all taxpayers would receive a tax cut under this proposal \u2014 at least 7 percent of taxpayers would pay higher taxes under the proposal in 2018 and at least 25 percent of taxpayers would pay more in 2027.By 2027, the center found, those in the bottom two quintiles would, on average, get very modest annual cuts of $10 and $40; those in the third, fourth and fifth quintiles would get average cuts of $320, $710 and $3,860. Those in the top 1 percent would get a $52,780 tax cut and those in the top 0.1 percent a $278,370 cut.In other words, the Trump tax bill, contrary to the president\u2019s populist spin, is a classic trickle-down proposal, concentrating by far the largest share of benefits on corporations and the rich.The most expensive parts of the tax bill are a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, with lost revenues totaling $1.46 trillion over ten years, along with a five-year provision letting corporations immediately write off the entire cost of capital investments, instead of depreciating them over several years, with an additional revenue loss of $84.2 billion.Larry Summers, a professor of economics at Harvard who served as secretary of the Treasury from 1999 to 2001, argues, along with a number of other economists, that the combination of the rate cut and the immediate write-off of investments \u2014 known as \u201cexpensing\u201d \u2014 amounts to a very high-cost expenditure that produces very little social benefit.What is the compelling case for cutting the corporate rate to 20 per cent? Under the proposed plan, for at least five years businesses will be able to write off investments in new equipment entirely in the year they are made. So the government is sharing to an equal extent in the costs of and the returns from investment, eliminating any tax induced disincentive to invest. The effective tax rate on new investment is reduced to zero or less, before even considering the corporate rate reduction. Corporate rate reduction serves only to reward monopoly profits, other rents or past investments. After the trends of the past few years, are shareholders really the most worthy recipients of a windfall?if corporations can immediately write off new investments for equipment, then the corporate rate cut on those investments amounts to only a windfall gain, cutting taxes on returns to old investment. With expensing, corporations that use debt financing with tax deductible interest payments end up getting tax rebates to cover some of the costs of new investments regardless of the statutory tax rate.So what must you do, or whom must you be, to get the 25% rate? First, you get it for 100% of your net business income from passive activities, which generally are business activities in which you personally do not materially participate. This typically applies to people who invest money in all kinds of partnerships, S corporation activities, et cetera that engage in pretty much any type of business.Shaviro calls this obscure set of provisions in the tax bill \u201ca weapon to enhance plutocracy \u2014 offering the biggest rate cut to millionaires,\u201d allowing those \u201cwho are in effect rentiers to get the low (25 percent) rate\u201d on all their income.Pass-through income would be taxed at no more than 25 percent, far below the 39.6 percent top individual income tax rate that now applies to pass-through income, or the top 35% top rate that would apply to individual income under the GOP plan. This would provide a massive windfall to the very wealthy.This section of the bill has been nicknamed the \u201cTrump loophole\u201d by the centerbecause Donald Trump exemplifies the type of business owner whom it would most benefit.We don\u2019t know how much Trump collects in such income, which has become passive for him since he put his children in charge of his enterprises rather than running them himself. But given that he seems to have stakes in at least 500 pass-through entities, it looks like reducing his rate to 25 percent from 39.6 percent would save him a ton of money.Ditch the pass-through break, the one that taxes income of partnerships and other businesses organized in forms other than corporations at a rate lower than it taxes wages. This is a compliance and complexity nightmare. There\u2019s no economic reason to apply lower tax rates on businesses based on how they are organized, no justification to tax entrepreneurial income differently based on how it is earned, and no way to differentiate between one form of business activity and other without onerous rules and intrusive audits.For political reasons, Looney argues, Republicans should eliminate the break tohelp avoid the caricature of \u201ctax cuts for the rich.\u201d No form of income is more concentrated among top-income taxpayers than pass-through business income and the reduced rate would only benefit taxpayers in the highest two brackets (e.g., married taxpayers earning over $260,000).An earlier version of this column misstated the year in which the Joint Committee on Taxation expects the value of the proposed estate tax cut to reach $38 billion; it is 2027, not 2017.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocratic leaders in Washington have been criticized for lacking a message that voters can embrace. They have been disparaged as too old and too wedded to the zero sum politics of this polarized era. So we looked outside the nation\u2019s capital to ask leaders in states and cities to offer their vision for reconnecting with voters who have left the party and propelled Republicans into control of the White House and Congress.All of them agreed that the party needed to focus on matters that are urgent and relevant in the lives of ordinary Americans, rather than engaging in daily firefights with Republicans and President Trump.Here is what they had to say. Some of the interviews were edited for brevity and clarity.Gov. Jay Inslee of WashingtonThere are three pillars of our future success. One, we have found that a very consistent first step is talking about jobs and economic growth. Consistently focusing on jobs with a capital \u201cJ\u201d and a plan to deliver jobs will serve us well. Second, you cannot overstate the appetite, desire and thirst for some sense of unity, and just rationality, as opposed to the divisiveness and chaos that this president has brought.There is such a strong distaste for the madness coming out of the White House that simply showing a sense of rationality is very appealing to people right now.The third issue is that the states are the place where Donald Trump cannot stop us. He cannot stop our clean energy jobs programs. He cannot stop our ways to finance college for the middle class. He cannot stop us, because the American system is based on the united states.It\u2019s true in clean energy in my state, where those jobs are growing 17 times faster than the overall economy right now.And we need to demonstrate job creation in small and rural communities across the country.We need a national policy that will focus on those areas that have been de-industrialized. We are going to be able to show job creation across the state in urban and rural areas.The Democratic Party can and should be the party to offer those solutions. You can\u2019t go back and just say we are going to bring back the jobs that disappeared when the tech revolution occurred. You\u2019ve got to focus on the jobs of today and tomorrow. Policy matters.Mayor Rahm Emanuel of ChicagoDemocrats need to channel our anger, not be defined by it. We need to be clear about what we stand for, not just rail against what we oppose.Our message must make a connection with the challenges Americans are facing, including making debt-free college a reality, expanding access to affordable health care and creating good-paying jobs. Democrats must present a credible plan to address America\u2019s problems that meets voters where they are.The laws of political gravity already ensure that the 2018 election will be a referendum on President Trump and the Republicans in Congress. Thus far, that record has been abysmal, with one high-profile failure on top of another.As bad as the policies Republicans are pursuing would be for middle-class Americans, their inability to pass them and actually govern the country \u2014 despite unified control \u2014 only exacerbates their vulnerability and opens the door for Democrats.It is up to us, then, to walk through that door by doing what our most effective leaders have always done: articulating an aspirational, attainable agenda for the future while presenting a clear contrast with the other side.Attorney General Xavier Becerra of CaliforniaI don\u2019t think our message should be any different than it was when F.D.R. was president or J.F.K. was president. If you work hard and play by the rules, we\u2019ve got your back.I think F.D.R. made it very clear when he established Social Security: He went after the banks, he created the unemployment insurance system. L.B.J. created Medicare. J.F.K. created the Peace Corps. Democrats created the G.I. Bill of Rights. All of those things demonstrated if you just do it the right way, we will have your back.It\u2019s focused squarely on the folks in the middle, folks who aspire to be in the middle. It reminds me of how so much of what F.D.R., J.F.K. and L.B.J. did really focused on my parents, on how a construction worker and a clerical worker in my mom and dad\u2019s time could go on to buy a house and send four kids to college and live in retirement in dignity.But I think most people will tell you, they don\u2019t believe it, they don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve got your back as leaders. And that\u2019s where Democratic leaders need to come forward and say, no, we do have your back.I try to explain to folks the pain and the anxiety that a lot of formerly middle-class families in the Rust Belt states, for example, are feeling these days \u2014 and that explains why so many of them voted for Donald Trump for president. That\u2019s the same pain and anxiety my parents went through. They are Latino immigrants. They had that working-class sense of optimism that they will do better for their kids, and their kids will do better. In my case, there was no doubt.A lot of folks in the Rust Belt states are saying, \u2018Hey, we don\u2019t see our kids and grandkids exceeding our expectations \u2014 or their own expectations.\u2019\u201dAs a son of immigrants, I am an optimist because it runs in my DNA. But if you\u2019ve got two or three generations now, where before you used to have that union job at G.M., or even that coal mining job, you do start to get skeptical.Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode IslandThe economy is changing, and Americans are worried about keeping up and getting ahead. Not long ago, if you had a high school diploma, you could get a good job. Generations of families worked in factories building things.Today, it\u2019s nearly impossible to find a good job out of high school, and the cost of a college education is on the rise. People who don\u2019t have a college degree know it\u2019s harder than ever to get the skills needed to get good work. And a lot of people have decided we don\u2019t understand their struggles.Democrats are committed to making sure everyone who is willing to work hard has a fair shot at a good job. The economy is changing, yes. We can\u2019t turn back the clock. But we can make sure there\u2019s a place for everyone in the new economy.Not as many people will work in the type of factory my father worked in when I was a kid, but we have a real opportunity to expand advanced manufacturing in America.There\u2019s still a crucial role for people who have skills. Elected leaders must focus on getting our people trained for the new, advanced manufacturing jobs we\u2019re creating. These jobs require the same work ethic and determination that made America the most powerful economy in the world. This is our promise to Americans: We will create more jobs, and give everyone the training and education they need to get the good jobs we\u2019re creating. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in Rhode Island.Mayor Kasim Reed of AtlantaWe find ourselves on different ground today \u2014 but it\u2019s not entirely new ground. History shows there have been many times in our country when there was a struggle over who will have the influence to define the future.The Democratic Party needs to demonstrate, once again, that we\u2019re fighting for a future where we can be the best version of ourselves. We need to regain the energy, the unity and the confidence that have carried us in the past, because our passion never fails. The best version of America is worth the effort. A big, bold, inclusive vision for America is the key.As President John F. Kennedy once said, things don\u2019t just happen. They are made to happen. I believe the Democratic Party needs to say loudly and clearly that the future we will make is one where you can be who you are, love who you love and pursue your dreams \u2014 where you can have a fair shot and a fair shake \u2014 regardless of your place of birth, your parents\u2019 income, the color of your skin, your gender or your religion. We envision a future where every American can achieve their highest potential without limits.These ideals are under attack at this very moment, but there are some fights which must be fought \u2014 and the Democratic Party will be at the forefront.Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, IND.To me, we are making this way too complicated. The message to me is that we are the party that is out to support and protect ordinary people going about their lives.So I think as a party, we\u2019ve got to return the center of gravity to lived experience, and there are some indications that it is happening. If you look at the most important policy, which is holding off A.C.A. repeal, what really turned the tide there wasn\u2019t the cleverness of Democratic office holders, it was ordinary people telling their stories in town halls.The beauty of that was it was an antidote to alternative facts. You can\u2019t lie to somebody about the circumstances of their own life.We have the message: that we are sticking up for ordinary people as they go through their lives. The challenge is to convey that message in a way that gets through some of the false choices. Do we maintain our commitment to racial justice or do we appeal to the white working class? I think that\u2019s a terrible question. Who wouldn\u2019t want to do both?Democrats\u2019 policy goals should be to make sure that everybody continues to have access to health care by whatever it takes. Making sure that large institutions, especially banks and corporations, can\u2019t rip you off. We have a responsibility to make sure everybody has a shot and has a way to fit in.I talk about it a lot in terms of freedom because Democrats have to get back in the habit of talking about freedom.Your freedom very much depends on whether you can start a business and know you have access to health care, whether you can marry someone you love or sue a bank that is cheating you. That\u2019s our freedom agenda.In Washington, all the protagonists are political characters. It\u2019s gotten to be as if the only people who matter are politicians. It\u2019s all about the individual as characters. What\u2019s going on with Roy Moore? What\u2019s going on with Nancy Pelosi? What\u2019s going on with Steve Bannon? And there\u2019s all these people in places like Indiana who say: What about me? I\u2019ve never met Steve Bannon.And we\u2019ve allowed the conversation because it\u2019s mesmerizing, it\u2019s fascinating, it\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d but people need to see themselves as the main characters in the story we are telling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Energy Idea for Mars Yields a Clue for Powering Data Centers", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 As a scientist working for NASA in the 1990s, K. R. Sridhar developed a contraption that could use energy from the sun to transform the elements of the Martian atmosphere into breathable air or propulsion fuel.It passed all its tests, but a planned mission to send it to Mars in 2001 was canceled and Dr. Sridhar moved on, looking to apply what he had learned to help stem climate change on earth instead.\u201cI came full circle \u2014 I was trying to make a really uninhabitable planet habitable,\u201d Dr. Sridhar, 56, said recently, holding a black-domed prototype of the shelved device at his Silicon Valley office. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018I can do something to make this planet a little more sustainable.\u2019 \u201dAlmost two decades later, that thought has led to a fleet of fuel-cell generators that produce electricity through a chemical reaction. And with a recent deal for Dr. Sridhar\u2019s company, Bloom Energy, to install generators at a dozen data centers in California and New Jersey for Equinix, a leading operator, it is poised for a major expansion.The aim of the deal, financed by a subsidiary of a deep-pocketed electric utility, Southern Company, is not only to create a reliable energy source for a power-thirsty industry, but also to help validate a technology that has struggled to gain mainstream acceptance.What is striking is that the fuel cells are not running on hydrogen, like the ones long seen as a promising power source for cars. Instead, they use natural gas, which has become plentiful after a production boom over the last decade.Even though they consume fossil fuels, the gas-powered cells have attracted the attention of some environment-minded policymakers, investors and entrepreneurs because they release less of the heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide than conventional plants. And they have been slowly finding fans among energy-conscious corporations \u2014 in Walmart stores, eBay data centers and Morgan Stanley\u2019s corporate headquarters.Scott Samuelsen, director of the National Fuel Cell Research Center at the University of California, Irvine, said data centers could become an important market for fuel cells because the industry \u201cappears to want to be more environmentally sensitive but more reliant on their own resources.\u201dPart of the environmental appeal lies in their efficiency. Fuel cells are generally installed on site, so they do not need to burn extra fuel to compensate for energy lost over long transmission lines. In addition, they use less fuel per watt of power than conventional plants because they don\u2019t burn fuels to heat water or air to spin turbines.That also makes them quiet, which has proved a surprising barrier to their acceptance among potential customers, Professor Samuelsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for anyone to believe that they\u2019re making any power,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a jet engine.\u201dThe innovations at Bloom stem from Dr. Sridhar\u2019s work on NASA\u2019s Mars exploration program when he was director of the Space Technologies Laboratory at the University of Arizona. Trained as a mechanical engineer in his native India, Dr. Sridhar arrived at the lab after getting a doctorate at the University of Illinois.On the Mars project, he focused on using electricity to fuel chemical reactions among elements found on the Red Planet, even creating dirt capable of germinating a seed. Figuring that he should be able to reverse the process, he founded Bloom and worked on converting chemical energy to electricity using readily available fuels and conductors.Eventually, he and his team hit upon a version of the current design of roughly 5-inch-square fuel cells fused together in stacks \u2014 each about the size of a half-loaf of bread and capable of powering an average home. The stacks are loaded into tubular metal casings before being enclosed in banks about the size of a refrigerator that can then be arrayed on the ground or a roof to run large facilities.The equipment, produced at the company headquarters here with final assembly at a factory in Delaware, is simultaneously high- and low-tech. Each cell is made from a thin ceramic wafer that is mainly zirconia \u2014 a relative of the diamond substitute. In a process reminiscent of high school art class, the wafers are screen printed with chemical inks on each side in an automated sequence and then fired in kilns. They are sandwiched between metal plates, and the resulting structure is a solid oxide fuel cell that can operate at very high temperatures, about 800 degrees Celsius, or 1,472 degrees Fahrenheit.At that temperature, when natural gas mixed with steam flows over one surface of the cell while oxygen flows over the other, a reaction results in the release of electricity, steam that is recycled through the process and carbon dioxide.Equinix tested the Bloom cells at a data center in San Jose for 18 months before committing to the current arrangement, in which it will buy the energy under a 15-year power purchase agreement. The company, which runs more than 185 data centers on five continents, serves as a kind of cloud and network broker. It builds and operates facilities that provide space, power and cooling as well as work rooms, showers and a security system featuring a series of locked chambers like something out of \u201cGet Smart.\u201d The client companies bring their own servers and other hardware to plug into more than 1,000 networks that connect them to customers and to each other.The Southern Company, based in Atlanta, comes into the partnership because it has unregulated businesses that sell power nationwide. In this case, Southern buys the fuel-cell generators from Bloom and then, through a subsidiary called PowerSecure, sells the output to Equinix under a 15-year agreement.The Bloom deal with Equinix and Southern is among the largest ever for a fuel-cell business, but Bloom faces competition from other providers, like Fuel Cell Energy, which is based in Danbury, Conn., and has a partnership with Exxon Mobil. It has won a number of recent contracts, which include installing and operating three fuel-cell projects for the Long Island Power Authority and one that will supply power for the Navy submarine base in Groton, Conn.Indeed, the United States government has had a hand in the technology\u2019s development through grant programs at the Energy Department and a federal tax credit that expired at the end of last year.The natural-gas fuel cells provide some environmental advantages over traditional power plants that run on fossil fuels: They use little water and release almost no harmful smog emissions. The Bloom cells can also run on biogas or hydrogen, which would make them even more environmentally friendly, given a steady supply of those fuels.The usefulness of natural-gas fuel cells in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a matter of some debate, however. Some environmentalists and public-utility officials say the fuel cells\u2019 emissions may be understated and question whether their carbon reductions are sufficient to warrant public subsidies.Still, their emissions are well below the average for coal-fired plants. Bloom puts the emissions of its natural-gas cells in the range of 679 to 833 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour, while coal plants released 2,252 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour in the second quarter of this year, according to the Power Sector Carbon Index, an analysis published by the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University. They are much closer to those of natural-gas plants, which, according to the index, averaged 938 pounds per megawatt-hour during the same period.Though companies looking to power energy-hungry data centers have often sought out hydroelectric power, which does not depend on fossil fuels and is generally inexpensive, fuel-cell technology is gaining traction, especially for customers who need an extremely steady power supply even during storms. For Tom Fanning, chief executive of Southern Company, the partnership with Bloom is part of a bid to take advantage of the technological advances that are upending the electric industry by allowing customers to make their own power, known as distributed generation.\u201cFor 100 years, we have had a business model predicated on the notion of making, moving and selling electricity, essentially up to a meter,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe started seeing this make-move-and-sell model moving to the customer premises. And so we decided to become involved in this space.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Declares \u2018America First\u2019 Policy a Success After Asia Trip", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump boasted on Wednesday that nearly 10 months of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy had restored strength and respect to the United States on the world stage after years of what he called failed leadership under his predecessors.Mr. Trump nonetheless declared the trip a resounding success, saying that he had made real progress by uniting the world against North Korea and insisting on reciprocal trade from Asian nations.\u201cAmerica\u2019s renewed confidence and standing in the world has never been stronger than it is right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is exactly what the world saw: a strong, proud and confident America.\u201dAnnounced with little notice and delivered midafternoon from the Diplomatic Room of the White House, the president\u2019s speech was designed to be what his critics have never offered him: a sweeping and positive assessment of his own performance as the nation\u2019s commander in chief and top diplomat.By recounting his travels and detailing the just completed Asia trip, Mr. Trump sought to make the case that the United States was once again playing a leading role in the world.\u201cMy fellow citizens, America is back, and the future has never looked brighter,\u201d he said.\u201cHe is so easily played by foreign leaders, so transparently susceptible to flattery,\u201d said Eliot A. Cohen, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s harshest critics and a former adviser to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. \u201cIt clearly has undermined the reputation of the United States, the credibility of the United States.\u201dThe tweet raised anticipation that Mr. Trump planned a big announcement on trade. Instead, asserted on Wednesday that \u201ceverywhere we went,\u201d he and the American delegation was met with \u201cincredible warmth, hospitality and, most importantly, respect\u201d from world leaders of other nations.\u201cTo each of these places, I have carried our vision for a better \u2014 a vision for something stronger and sovereign \u2014 so important \u2014 sovereign and independent nations, rooted in their histories, confident in their destinies, and cooperating together to advance their security, prosperity and the noble cause of peace,\u201d Mr. Trump said.In talking about his foreign policy achievements, Mr. Trump has often bragged about the personal relationships he has forged with his counterparts in China, the Middle East and elsewhere.In Wednesday\u2019s speech, Mr. Trump hoped to highlight what his advisers said were three successes from his just-concluded trip to South Korea, Japan, China, Vietnam and the Philippines: attempts to unite opposition to North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions; to strengthen economic alliances; and to insist on fair trade.John D. Negroponte, who served as deputy secretary of state under President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump should get credit, both for developing relationships with his counterparts and for effectively delivering a tough message toward North Korea.\u201cI thought he handled that very well, with friend and adversary alike,\u201d Mr. Negroponte, who also served as the director of national intelligence, said after the speech.Critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy have hammered the president for his use of childish names for Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. They say Mr. Trump has deepened the possibility of a nuclear crisis, not reduced tensions. And some say Mr. Trump\u2019s retreat from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement has robbed the United States of influence in the region.In fact, Mr. Trump ended his Asia trip without appearing to conclude any of the one-on-one trade deals with individual nations that he often has said would be the hallmark of his administration.\u201cThe big question mark remains: Does he have an economic strategy toward the East Asian region?\u201d Mr. Negroponte said. \u201cYou withdraw from the TPP and say \u2018America First.\u2019 I notice no one is getting in line to make unilateral deals.\u201dIn his remarks, Mr. Trump mentioned the World Trade Organization and asserted that the 21 leaders he met with during summit meetings in Asia \u201crecognized the need to address unfair trade practices, and acknowledged that the W.T.O. is in strong need of reform.\u201dMr. Trump did make a point of saying that \u201cno one owns the ocean,\u201d a reference to the long-running and tense dispute in East Asia about China\u2019s efforts to control access to the South China Sea. \u201cFreedom of navigation and overflight are critical to the security and prosperity of all nations,\u201d he said.But Mr. Trump did not single out China for criticism, continuing a pattern of soft-pedaling on a dispute that could annoy United States allies.Despite that, Mr. Trump hoped his speech would galvanize public opinion behind the idea that his leadership on foreign policy was restoring a new sense of optimism about the United States around the world.\u201cA president is entitled to proclaim a sunny day while everyone else is huddling under their umbrellas,\u201d said Philip Zelikow, who served as a diplomat and foreign policy adviser in several Republican administrations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Honoring a Hidden Slave Burial Ground", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorks in ProgressThough he didn\u2019t realize it, Mr. Butler was not completely alone. Not far from him, four feet below, lay the remains of a number of African-American slaves from the 18th and 19th centuries.\u201cI had no idea,\u201d said Mr. Butler, taking five and looking down at the grass. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m attracted to this spot.\u201dThere is no marker, but nearby is a small cemetery \u2014 gated and locked \u2014 right in the middle of the 2.5-acre park with tombstones for the owners of those who toiled on their farms. Outside the white cemetery is a sign, revised in 2014, that mentions the slaves. \u201cHere lie the nanny, coachman, farm laborer, wood cutter, drover, blacksmith, cook, groom, carpenter and seamstress whose unpaid labor contributed to Hunts Point\u2019s large profitable estates.\u201d\u201cWe need the Parks Department to O.K. a memorial,\u201d said Mr. Panaritis, a retired official with the Department of Education. \u201cAnd we\u2019d like to see the burial ground put into the curriculum, not just of P.S. 48, but in other schools as well.\u201dMr. Panaritis, who ran a D.O.E. project called Teaching American History, brought the burial ground to light after discovering a black-and-white photograph from 1910, showing gravestones amid a tangle of weeds, with the words \u201cSlave burying ground, Hunts Point Road\u201d written on the back. After further research, he discovered that as many as 44 slaves had lived in the area, according to 1800 census figures, with the last burial in the 1840s. In the early 20th century, because of road construction, the burial ground was graded, probably unearthing and destroying some of the remains. He believes up to 11 slaves may still be buried at the site.In March, an archaeological study confirmed much of Mr. Panaritis\u2019s research. Dr. Jessica Striebel MacLean, an archaeologist who conducted the study using two rounds of ground-penetrating radar, found what appears to be burial shafts and the profiles of four collapsed coffins just beyond the white cemetery, near what would have been Hunts Point Road \u2014 now simply a path. The white landowner graves are situated east-west, in keeping with Christian burial practices. The slaves would have been buried away from the masters in unconsecrated ground. Their grave orientation \u2014 north-south \u2014 suggests lower socioeconomic status.This summer parks officials met with the community and discussed possibilities for identifying the site: a digital kiosk, new seating and signs, an engraved stone marker or a plaque. Some have suggested building a visitors\u2019 center at the site, but officials are wary of disturbing the remains with construction. The department is now working on renderings and estimated costs for various scenarios.The archaeological study was financed with $15,000 set aside by State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, with an additional $35,000 to support P.S. 48\u2019s programs related to the project. Councilman Rafael Salamanca Jr. has also budgeted $100,000 for improvements at the site.Dr. MacLean suggests that further surveys be conducted, as well as research into who might be buried there, using documents and wills, which include the transfer of ownership of the slaves from one generation to the next.In the spring of 2016, Justin Czarka, a teacher, and his students helped Dr. MacLean with her survey. They measured the standing gravestones of the Hunt, Willett and Leggett families who settled here in the 17th century, identified the types of stones used \u2014 marble, sandstone and granite \u2014 made drawings and wrote up their own reports.\u201cWhat was great about Jessica was that she was able to bring the kids into the process and work with them,\u201d said Mr. Czarka, who teaches English as a second language at the school.\u201cThe children were so actively engaged,\u201d Dr. MacLean said. \u201cAnd Justin used what we found as a jumping-off point for these kids to have them discuss the burial and memory traditions in their own families.\u201d Children at the school come from a number of backgrounds and speak English, French, Chinese, Arabic and Spanish.Because the park has so few visitors, those basics have been ignored for years. Benches, some argue, will only attract a bad element. Mr. Czarka disagrees. \u201cIt reinforces this vicious cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have those things, people won\u2019t come to the park. But if they\u2019re put in place, people will use it \u2014 for good,\u201d he said, glancing over at Mr. Butler, still playing his trombone.The ParticularsSite Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the BronxAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E. Rolls Back the Breadth of Its Ambitions", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn Flannery, the new chief of General Electric, is backing away from the ambitious designs of his two predecessors, who steered the corporate giant and its conglomerate-style empire building for more than three decades.Mr. Flannery, who became chief executive in August, left no doubt on Monday that the conglomerate era is long gone. The new G.E., he declared repeatedly in his first detailed presentation on its future, will be a smaller company with fewer businesses.The operations up for sale include businesses that reach back to the days of G.E.\u2019s founder Thomas Edison, like light bulbs and railroad locomotives. More than $20 billion in assets are earmarked for sale in the next couple of years.In addition, to help pay for the remaking of the company, G.E. announced on Monday that it would cut its dividend, only the second time it has done so since the Great Depression. The quarterly payout will be sliced in half, to 12 cents a share.The goal is to make G.E. \u201csimpler and easier to operate,\u201d Mr. Flannery said. \u201cComplexity has hurt us.\u201dThat complexity was long a part of the company\u2019s pitch to investors. Past executives like Jack Welch argued that they could efficiently manage businesses that had little in common, like television, with NBC, and financial services. Other companies followed that thinking as well, leading to a wave of deal-making.The streamlining began under Jeffrey R. Immelt, who led G.E. for 16 years after Mr. Welch retired in 2001. Mr. Immelt\u2019s goal for G.E. was to create an industrial company for the internet age, adding software and sensors to industrial equipment to make \u201csmart\u201d machines. It was a bold plan, and Mr. Immelt once predicted that G.E. would become \u201ca Top 10 software company\u201d by 2020.No more. While the digital strategy is still vital to G.E., Mr. Flannery said he was cutting that unit\u2019s spending by $400 million in 2018, and focusing on a few products.Even the G.E. board of directors is being reduced, to 12 members from 18. Three of the dozen will be new directors.Mr. Flannery, 56, sought to portray the path ahead not as a retreat but as an inspiring challenge.\u201cThis is the opportunity of a lifetime to reinvent an iconic company,\u201d he said.Still, the hoped-for reinvention, even if successful, is going to take time. G.E. lowered its earnings target for next year and reiterated that 2018 would be a \u201creset year.\u201d And the outlook for 2019, while improving, is expected to be challenging as well for its big power-turbine business, which fell off sharply this year.It will also change the complexion of the company. G.E., the country\u2019s largest manufacturing company, had nearly 300,000 employees worldwide at the end of last year. The impending sales of several businesses and other cost-cutting initiatives will undoubtedly leave it with far fewer in the coming years, in more focused areas.\u201cJohn Flannery is generally saying and doing the right things,\u201d said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm. \u201cBut I was looking for more \u2014 faster and more aggressive moves, both on cost-cutting and thinning the portfolio of businesses.\u201dConcerns about the pace of change and the dividend cut sent G.E. shares, which had already dropped by 35 percent this year through Friday, down more than 7 percent on Monday.Mr. Flannery had previously given broad outlines of his strategy, including that the company would shed at least $20 billion in assets over the next two years. What came on Monday were details that confirmed a shortlist of businesses that are up for sale, like lighting, which has quietly been on sale for months.He also emphasized his belief in the vitality of a smaller G.E., and nodded to products like electric generators, jet engines and medical-imaging equipment. Because of those products, Mr. Flannery said, the company will continue to \u201cpower the world,\u201d \u201ctransport people safely\u201d and \u201csave lives.\u201dHe also described other parts of the businesses as \u201cfundamentally strong,\u201d including wind turbines for renewable energy, and the company\u2019s railroad-equipment unit, which is expected to be sold off.Mr. Flannery\u2019s strategy will accelerate the streamlining job begun by his immediate predecessor. Mr. Immelt described the company he inherited as a \u201cclassic conglomerate.\u201d During his tenure, G.E. sold off its media business, NBC Universal, to Comcast and its consumer appliance business, among others.But the biggest move was to shed nearly all of the company\u2019s finance arm, GE Capital. At its peak, the finance unit accounted for more than half of the company\u2019s profits, and its lending ranged from home mortgages in Japan to reinsurance for long-term care for the aged.Mr. Flannery has attacked expenses, and he spoke repeatedly on Monday about injecting more \u201crigor and accountability\u201d into the G.E. culture. Mr. Immelt departed earlier than expected as chief executive after Trian Fund Management, an activist hedge fund, persistently pressured G.E. to improve its financial performance. Edward Garden of Trian joined the G.E. board last month.To link management behavior more tightly to financial performance, Mr. Flannery is changing the compensation program for G.E.\u2019s top 5,000 managers. The current plan, he explained, is about 70 percent in cash and the remainder in stock. The new plan, he added, will flip that ratio, with 70 percent of compensation in stock.His own pay package, Mr. Flannery said, will be 100 percent in stock, with the amount of shares determined by the performance of the company.Since becoming chief executive, Mr. Flannery has grounded the corporate jet fleet, stretched out the construction schedule for G.E.\u2019s new headquarters in Boston, closed down several international research-and-development labs and trimmed the work force in units like GE Digital.GE Digital, Mr. Flannery said, \u201ccontinues to be vital to the company.\u201d But its spending will be trimmed sharply as it concentrates on a narrower set of products that improve the efficiency and performance of G.E.\u2019s industrial equipment.G.E. last cut its dividend in 2009 in the throes of the financial crisis, when it was the nation\u2019s largest non-bank financial institution.The move announced on Monday reflects the company\u2019s declining cash flow, but it is also a byproduct of the streamlining strategy. In the future, there will be fewer businesses to put cash in the corporate till.The total dividend payout had been $8.4 billion a year, among the most costly for American corporations. But the cash flow to cover that bill has faltered.When G.E. reported its third-quarter earnings last month, it said cash flow for the year would be about $7 billion, down from an initial target of $12 billion to $14 billion.The 12-cent quarterly dividend will consume only $4.2 billion. Mr. Flannery acknowledged \u201cthe gravity of this decision,\u201d especially for individual shareholders who rely on dividend income. But it is necessary, he said, to \u201crestore the oxygen of cash to the company.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of John Flannery, General Electric\u2019s new chief executive. He is 56, not 55.Advertisement"}

The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you\u2019ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).\u201cWomen can\u2019t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,\u201d said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.Dr. Carnevale wouldn\u2019t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.Not so. In seven states \u2014 Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington \u2014 students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.\u201cStudents at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,\u201d Dr. Carnevale said.They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. \u201cIt increases your breadth of knowledge,\u201d he said.The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of \u201cYou Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a \u2018Useless\u2019 Liberal Arts Education.\u201d In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.\u201cOnce C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,\u201d Mr. Anders said, \u201cthey come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.\u201dWhy settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created \u201cmeta-majors,\u201d which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.\u201cWe have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,\u201d said Timothy Renick, Georgia State\u2019s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.\u201cStudents in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,\u201d Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana \u2014 enigmatology.\u201cMajors are artificial and restrictive,\u201d said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.\u201cMajors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don\u2019t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.\u201dMajors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today\u2019s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.\u201cI would argue against majoring in accounting,\u201d he said, \u201cor anything that a computer can be programmed to do.\u201dJeffrey J.

{"Headline": "Constitutional Convention: Thanks, but No Thanks", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThat the mechanisms of New York State governance require serious repair is beyond dispute.A campaign finance system that fosters corruption and creates kingmakers of moneyed interests cries out for a thorough overhaul. The incumbent protection racket known as gerrymandering must end. The voting process needs to be reinvented to stimulate anemic turnouts. And greater home rule for New York City and other municipalities is essential: It\u2019s absurd that the city, for instance, needs Albany\u2019s permission for something as prosaic as lowering speed limits on its own streets.These and other issues could be fodder for a state constitutional convention, arguably a once-in-a-generation chance to reshape New York democracy. Every 20 years, under law, a question must be put before the electorate, as it will be again on Tuesday for the first time since 1997. Voters will get to say aye or nay to this, Ballot Proposal 1: \u201cShall there be a convention to revise the Constitution and amend the same?\u201dFor the most part, New Yorkers have not cottoned to con-cons, to use a common shorthand. They voted \u201cno\u201d 20 years ago, just as they did 40 and 60 years ago. Except for a convention in the mid-1960s initiated by the Legislature \u2014 a fruitless exercise, since its proposals were ultimately shot down at the ballot box \u2014 no assemblage of this kind has been held since 1938.But we feel obliged this time to recommend a \u201cno\u201d vote. It\u2019s not because we fear change. On the contrary, the concern is that the likelihood of a con-con yielding the most desperately needed reforms is disappointingly low, and the possibility of its accomplishing nothing at significant cost, or, worse, setting New York back even further, is worrisomely high.A lot has happened since 1997. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 ruling in the Citizens United case opened the floodgates to limitless campaign cash from ill-intentioned characters determined to twist public opinion for their own benefit. Britain\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s election in 2016 demonstrated the ascendance of demagogy and fearmongering. In this climate, the danger of a hack-filled convention going haywire is palpably greater than it was two decades ago.Delegates would be chosen according to the contours of the gerrymandered State Senate \u2014 three from each of the 63 districts plus 15 at-large representatives, for a total of 204. There\u2019s every reason to believe we would basically end up with the same politicians and factotums who now shape (or misshape) state policy. That outcome would hardly justify spending tens of millions of taxpayer dollars first on selecting the delegates in 2018, then on convening them in April 2019, and finally on holding a referendum on their proposals in November 2019.We don\u2019t fully share the fears of some con-con opponents who\u2019ve raised boogeymen about how the convention could unravel existing labor rights, pension provisions, environmental protections, reproductive freedoms and more. Their worries, while perhaps understandable, seem overwrought. But we also don\u2019t buy the argument of the pro-convention forces that no alternative path to reform exists.A convention would not accomplish anything that New York lawmakers couldn\u2019t already do on their own \u2014 if only they had the will. It\u2019s up to voters now to force them to summon that will. How? In crude terms, by throwing the bums out when they refuse to do the right thing.You have to wonder if New York democracy is failing the electorate, or the other way around. Voters complain endlessly about Albany\u2019s fecklessness, yet they send the same people back to the State Senate and Assembly year after year. The re-election rate for each chamber in 2016 was 98 percent. One-third of the lawmakers ran unopposed last November. Those are results usually associated with places like Iraq under Saddam Hussein.At the risk of sounding starry-eyed, New Yorkers have it within their power, at the polls every two years, to demand a full Albany housecleaning. There\u2019s no need to wait for a plebiscite every other decade \u2014 and no compelling reason now for a costly convention with dubious prospects for essential change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Win the Battle of the Sexes Over Pay (Hint: It Isn\u2019t Simple.)", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewWhen Billie Jean King won the United States Open singles tennis title in 1972, her reward was a meager $10,000. Ilie N\u0103stase, her male counterpart, won $25,000.That is not the reality in the overall labor market, however, where women still earn less than men and there is considerable confusion about the reasons for the gender earnings gap \u2014 and about what can be done to eliminate it.Yet it is also true that the time demands of many jobs can explain much of the pay difference, a finding that has sobering implications. Eliminating the gender earnings gap will require changes in millions of households and thousands of individual workplaces.This definition focuses on the annual income of the individual at the median \u2014 or middle \u2014 of the income distribution for men and for women. Another valid option is to focus on mean, or average, earnings. Measured that way, the earnings gap is even greater. And there are many other measures.What\u2019s more, the gap is a statistic that changes during the life of a worker. Typically, it\u2019s small when formal education ends and employment begins, and it increases with age. More to the point, it increases when women marry and when they begin bearing children.Using the data that shows women earn 81 cents for each dollar earned by men, when the careers of recent college graduates start, the gap is much smaller: 92 cents for each male dollar. By the time college-educated women are 40 years old, they earn 73 cents.Correcting for time off and hours of work reduces the difference in the earnings between men and women but doesn\u2019t eliminate it.On the face of it, that looks like proof of disparate treatment. It may seem understandable that when a man works more hours than a woman, he earns more. But why should his compensation per hour be greater, given the same qualifications? But once again, the problem isn\u2019t simple.The data shows that women disproportionately seek jobs \u2014 including full-time jobs \u2014 that are more likely to mesh with family responsibilities, which, for the most part, are still greater for women than for men. So, the research shows, women tend to prefer jobs that offer flexibility: the ability to shift hours of work and rearrange shifts to accommodate emergencies at home.Such jobs tend to be more predictable, with fewer on-call hours and less exposure to weekend and evening obligations. These advantages have a negative consequence: lower earnings per hour, even when the number of hours worked is the same.Is that unfair? Maybe. But it isn\u2019t always an open-and-shut case. Companies point out that flexibility is often expensive \u2014 more so in some jobs than others.\u25a0 Subject to strict deadlines and time pressure\u25a0 Expected to be in direct contact with other workers or clients\u25a0 Instructed to develop cooperative working relationships\u25a0 Assigned to work on highly specific projects\u25a0 Unable to independently determine their tasks and goalsOccupations with a lower level of these characteristics (like jobs in science and technology) show smaller gaps, corrected for hours of work. Occupations with a higher level (like those in finance and law) have greater gaps. Men\u2019s earnings tend to surge when there are fewer substitutes for a given worker, when the job must be done in teams and when clients demand specific lawyers, accountants, consultants and financial advisers. Such differences can account for about half the gender earnings gap.Such considerations bring us to a very sensitive area: domestic arrangements at home, especially among couples with children. These are personal questions. In theory, gender earnings equality is possible when both parents take off the same amount of time and enjoy the same flexibility at work.Yet this isn\u2019t easy to accomplish in the world, as it exists now: Individual families that make such choices may incur high costs. From a classic economic standpoint, if one spouse or partner can earn more by working less flexible hours, as a family, the couple would earn more money by having that parent in that job, while the other partner accepts the more flexible one. A man can certainly be the more flexible member of this household \u2014 though he typically is not. Such decisions need to be made couple by couple.Reorganizing the workplace \u2014 a complicated undertaking \u2014 would help diminish the gap. It would also be narrowed if the burdens of family life were shouldered more equitably.In sum, the gap is mainly the upshot of two separate but related forces: workplaces that pay more per hour to those who work longer and more uncertain hours, and households in which women have assumed disproportionately large responsibilities.Equality on this court requires a level playing field at home and in the market. There are many battles ahead. Unfortunately, they need to be fought at several levels.Claudia Goldin is a professor of economics at Harvard University.

{"Headline": "De Blasio Coasts to Re-election, as Second-Term Challenges Await", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow comes the hard part.Gliding to his second landslide victory, Bill de Blasio was re-elected on Tuesday as the mayor of New York City, overwhelming his Republican challenger, Nicole Malliotakis, and a handful of independent candidates in what he declared a persuasive affirmation of his progressive agenda.\u201cIt\u2019s a good night for progressives,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at a victory party at the Brooklyn Museum, with his wife, Chirlane McCray, and his son, Dante, at his side. \u201cFor the first time in 32 years, a Democratic mayor was re-elected in New York City. But let\u2019s promise each other: This is the beginning of a new era of progressive Democratic leadership in New York City for years and years to come.\u201dYet Mr. de Blasio\u2019s ability to deliver on his agenda may have far more to do with the winds blowing out of Washington and Albany than with circumstances in the five boroughs.Federal budget cuts \u2014 threatened by President Trump and the Republican-led Congress, especially to social programs, health care and public housing \u2014 could cause serious problems and exacerbate social ills, forcing Mr. de Blasio to do financial triage. That could potentially drain money from signature programs, like his promise to accelerate and expand a push to build and preserve affordable housing.He has said that he would crusade in Albany to make the city\u2019s arcane property tax system fairer across neighborhoods. He said that he would appeal to Albany to improve the state\u2019s voting system to increase participation by making it easier to register to vote and to vote early.He wants money from Albany to make free schooling available to all 3-year-olds. And he wants the state to approve a tax on wealthy New Yorkers to pay for subway improvements.Mr. de Blasio is counting on his decisive victory to propel those changes. He received 66 percent of the vote, with more than 97 percent of electronic ballot scanners counted.Ms. Malliotakis, a state assemblywoman from Staten Island, received more than 27 percent of the vote.Also on Tuesday, Democratic incumbents breezed in the two other citywide races: Public Advocate Letitia James and Comptroller Scott M. Stringer both dispatched poorly financed Republican opponents.He withstood the sort of last-minute twists and events that could have made an incumbent vulnerable in a different, more closely fought campaign: a former donor testifying in a federal trial that he made contributions in exchange for access to City Hall; a deadly terrorist attack near the World Trade Center days before the vote.And he benefited from national politics, holding himself up as the city\u2019s bulwark against Mr. Trump, who was roundly rejected by New York City voters in 2016. Mr. de Blasio rarely skipped a chance to point out that Ms. Malliotakis voted for Mr. Trump last November.Mr. de Blasio called out Mr. Trump Tuesday night. He cheered Democratic victories for governor in key races in Virginia and New Jersey, and added, \u201cTonight, New York City sent a message to the White House as well.\u201dHe also sounded a note of urgency: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to become a fairer city and we\u2019ve got to do it soon, we\u2019ve got to do it fast,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw some important changes in the last four years, but you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201dSal Albanese, who lost to Mr. de Blasio in the Democratic primary and ran in the general election on the Reform Party line, received about 2 percent of votes.Bo Dietl, a retired police detective who ran as an independent on his own \u201cDump the Mayor\u201d line, received only about 1 percent, despite having appeared in two televised debates with Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Malliotakis and spending more than $1 million. He received fewer votes than the Green Party candidate, Akeem Browder, and was slightly trailing Michael Tolkin, the independent candidate.9 PhotosMr. de Blasio dismissed the testimony as the lies of a felon \u2014 Mr. Rechnitz pleaded guilty to a conspiracy count relating to bribery and influence buying \u2014 and he seemed to skate past it.Still, the testimony reminded voters of the state and federal investigations into the mayor\u2019s campaign finance practices that hobbled his administration throughout 2016 and into the first part of this year.In the end, the campaign could not escape the paradox of the mayor\u2019s personality: The \u201ctale of two cities\u201d of his campaign four years earlier had become a tale of two ways of seeing the mayor \u2014 a man who had made good on many of his promises and yet elicited little enthusiasm.The race was violently punctuated a week before the election when a man drove a rented pickup truck down the Hudson River Park bike lane, killing eight people and injuring a dozen, in what Mr. de Blasio quickly characterized as an act of terrorism. The carnage echoed the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, which occurred on the day of the mayoral primary that year, and helped create the conditions for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, to be elected mayor.But Mr. de Blasio\u2019s reassuring response to the tragedy provided no opening for his rivals to criticize his leadership under crisis.Ms. Malliotakis, 36, was not well known when she announced in April that she would seek the Republican nomination. Even after months of running, in what was her first citywide race, polls showed that most voters in the city \u2014 where Democrats outnumber Republicans among registered voters by more than six to one \u2014 did not know enough about her to form an opinion. She struggled to get voters\u2019 attention and to articulate a strong positive case for her candidacy, aside from criticism of Mr. de Blasio.\u201cI entered this race with eyes wide open, knowing that the odds were stacked against me,\u201d Ms. Malliotakis said after the race had been declared. \u201cWe may not have won this race, but we have made our voices heard.\u201dIn 2013, Mr. de Blasio received 795,679 votes, 72 percent of the ballots cast. On Tuesday night it appeared likely that he might not reach the same vote threshold. With 97 percent of scanners counted, Mr. de Blasio had about 706,000 votes.Shane Goldmacher, Luis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurn\u00ed and Jeffery C. Mays contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Votes to Begin Debate on Tax Overhaul", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate moved closer to approving a sweeping overhaul of the tax code on Wednesday, voting to begin debate on the tax bill as Republican leaders continue trying to secure the votes for final passage.The procedural vote, which passed 52 to 48 along party lines, put the Senate on track for a final vote later this week.The push by Senate Republicans to pass an ambitious tax overhaul now enters a critical and politically delicate phase. Republican leaders still lack firm commitments from enough of their members to ensure passage later in the week, and significant changes were still being discussed on Wednesday.Among the biggest potential changes would involve nudging the corporate tax rate from the proposed 20 percent rate to 22 percent. Such a move would still result in a large cut from the current top rate of 35 percent, but would give lawmakers some additional money to use for other concessions to help win over reluctant lawmakers.The higher rate was floated on Wednesday by two Republican senators, Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah, who want to use the money from a higher corporate rate to pay for an expanded child tax credit.\u201cIt makes us just as competitive, but it allows us to do the pro-worker reform that we desperately need,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, expressed openness to a slightly higher corporate rate than the Senate had proposed.\u201cFailure is not an option,\u201d Mr. Graham said when asked about raising the corporate tax rate to pay for other changes. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got to go up a point or two to make it work, I\u2019m fine with it.\u201dBut the White House was not receptive.\u201cWe do support the child tax credit,\u201d said Raj Shah, a White House spokesman. \u201cWe also think that it\u2019s important to make businesses more competitive. We would not support raising the corporate rate as outlined in that amendment.\u201dBut an additional sticking point emerged in the form of how to guard against ballooning budget deficits, with Republicans discussing whether automatic spending cuts could be put in place to ensure that deficits do not soar if the expected economic growth does not materialize.As negotiations among Republicans continued, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, complained that lawmakers did not know what exactly they would be debating.\u201cThere are rumors; there are whispers,\u201d he said shortly before the procedural vote, adding that the bill \u201cseems to have changed practically every half-hour.\u201dAs Republicans negotiate, they are encumbered by parliamentary rules that limit what provisions can be included in the bill. Another restriction: the final bill cannot cost more than $1.5 trillion over 10 years.The Senate will now begin a period of debate before a final vote on the plan.The measure\u2019s prospects have nonetheless seemed on the ascent, as reluctant senators speak more positively about the overhaul.Senate Republicans are using the same procedures to move the tax overhaul through the chamber as they used this summer to try to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In that effort, Republicans succeeded in voting to start debate, just as they did on Wednesday, but they could not ultimately muster the votes to approve a repeal bill.But big changes could still be made to the Senate package in the next day or two. The Senate\u2019s debate on the tax overhaul is limited to 20 hours, to be followed by a marathon series of amendment votes known as a vote-a-rama.Two Republican senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, have been unhappy with how the Senate plan treats pass-through businesses, whose profits are distributed to their owners and taxed at individual income tax rates.The current Senate plan allows pass-through owners to deduct 17.4 percent of business income as a way of lowering their tax rates. But Republicans now plan to lift the deduction to 20 percent, people familiar with the matter said.Before Wednesday\u2019s vote, Mr. Daines said that he had \u201cseen enough progress to vote yes to move the debate forward,\u201d alluding to the larger deduction.\u201cThere has been some good progress for Main Street businesses in the tax cut bill,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to secure more than $60 billion in tax cuts for Main Street businesses.\u201dThen there are Republican senators with concerns about ballooning the national debt, which has topped $20 trillion, a group that includes Bob Corker of Tennessee, Jeff Flake of Arizona and James Lankford of Oklahoma.Mr. Corker said Tuesday that he had received a commitment for some kind of mechanism to be added to the bill that would raise certain taxes if projected economic growth fell short of expectations. And Mr. Lankford cited the trigger provision as he voiced support for the tax overhaul on Wednesday.But the mechanics of such a trigger have not been laid out in detail, and some Republican lawmakers have reacted coolly to the proposal. Conservative groups like the Club for Growth and Americans for Tax Reform adamantly oppose the idea, saying it would undercut the economic growth by injecting uncertainty into the tax system.\u201cAny senator who understands basic business principles and truly cares about the deficit should understand that this trigger is an automatic tax increase and will actually harm economic growth,\u201d said David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth.An alternative approach would be to impose automatic spending cuts in the event that economic growth falls short of projections. Mr. Graham said that some of his colleagues saw cuts to nonmilitary programs as preferable to rolling back the tax cuts if they did not bring sufficient economic growth. He said that Republicans were divided on the idea of a trigger and what it would affect.Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said he opposed the concept of a trigger, but preferred one that cut spending to one that increased taxes. Senator Bill Cassidy, the other Louisiana Republican, also appeared fond of the idea of using spending cuts as a safeguard in the bill.\u201cIt\u2019s intriguing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Giuliani to Bill de Blasio \u2014 sharing the blame, that there are no easy fixes.Mr. Lhota said that after reading The Times article on his phone on Saturday morning, he put it down and said to himself, \u201cThis is exactly why I came back.\u201dMr. Lhota used his past experience as leader of the transportation authority during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 as a way of explaining how different this crisis is than what he faced in the past.He left the authority to run, unsuccessfully, for mayor against Mr. de Blasio.It was only after the state of the subway system had reached crisis levels that Mr. Cuomo called him back into service.This time, Mr. Lhota said, the challenge is far greater because the problems plaguing the subways were not the result of a single event, like a storm, but are the consequences of actions taken over a long period of time.Mr. Lhota said he wants to ensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated and he believes part of his responsibility is to be an advocate who presses elected officials to provide the resources needed to make short- and long-term investments.\u201cI believe that the New York City subway is the circulatory system that allows the economic engine of our region to function and flourish,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd like all circulatory systems that are overused and not maintained, they become sclerotic.\u201dHe took issue with some critics who say that steps like enhancing stations and platforms are more cosmetic should be put aside in favor of focusing on essential maintenance.\u201cThe fact is we have to do both,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be able to walk and chew gum.\u201dMr. Lhota also faces the challenge of improving the public\u2019s perception of the subway, especially among younger riders who have only known it during its high point and not during darker periods of disrepair and crime in the 1970s and 1980s.That battle will be waged largely on social media, which has become a powerful tool for frustrated riders.On Monday, the Riders Alliance, a transit advocacy group, sought to offer riders a way to direct their anger.The group handed out postcards that read \u2018Delayed again?\u201d and then encouraged them to send their thoughts directly to the governor on social media.\u201cHe needs to hear from YOU!\u201d the card reads.The goal of the cards, which were unveiled at a news conference outside Grand Central Terminal, is to \u201cturn subway riders into activists,\u201d said Rebecca Bailin, a spokeswoman for the group. \u201cIt is so frustrating, we want people to be able to channel that anger.\u201dJohn Raskin, the head of the group, said that the current focus on the transportation authority will hopefully force action.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear that the delays and breakdowns on the subway system aren\u2019t inevitable with the passage of time; they\u2019re a consequence of years of underinvestment and inattention from our elected leaders, up to and including the governor,\u201d he said.\u201cMedia coverage has helped riders make the connections between their day-to-day commutes and the policy choices that got us to this point.\u201dDani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, took issue with the way Mr. Raskin characterized the governor\u2019s handling of the crisis.\u201cWe fully recognize that the subway system is in unacceptable disrepair and is functioning with flawed performance, which is exactly why the state invested $8.4 billion in capital money, declared a state of emergency, funded the state\u2019s half of the action plan, and empaneled FIX NYC to identify a dedicated revenue stream for the system,\u201d she said in a statement.Despite the work ahead, Mr. Lhota remains optimistic that he can leave the system better than he found it.\u201cUnlike the naysayers, I believe the subway system can be fixed and put back on track,\u201d he said. \u201cOur survival as a city depends on a reliable mass transit system. We know what has caused the problems. Now let\u2019s fix it.\u201dJesse McKinley and Sarah Maslin Nir contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Endowments Boom as Colleges Bury Earnings Overseas", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "The Paradise PapersAmerican universities are using offshore strategies to swell their coffers, skirt taxes and obscure investments that could spark campus protests.Supported byIn 2006, the endowments of Indiana University and Texas Christian University invested millions of dollars in a partnership, hoping to mint riches from oil, gas and coal.The partnership was formed by the Houston-based Quintana Capital Group, whose principals include Donald L. Evans, an influential Texan and longtime supporter of former President George W. Bush. Little more than a year earlier, Mr. Evans had left his cabinet position as commerce secretary.Though the group had an impressive Texas pedigree, presidential cachet and ambitions for operations in the United States, the new partnership was established in the Cayman Islands. The founders promised their university and nonprofit investors that the partnership would try to avoid federal taxes by exploiting a loophole called \u201cblocker corporations,\u201d which are typically established in tax havens around the world.A trove of millions of leaked documents from a Bermuda-based law firm, Appleby, reflects some of the tax wizardry used by American colleges and universities. Schools have increasingly turned to secretive offshore investments, the files show, which let them swell their endowments with blocker corporations, and avoid scrutiny of ventures involving fossil fuels or other issues that could set off campus controversy.\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelmingly weighted towards the 1 percent,\u201d said Dean Zerbe, former tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cMost of the schools are the most elites in the country.\u201dThe House Republican tax plan includes a 1.4 percent tax on the investment income of private colleges and universities with endowment assets of $250,000 or more per student. It would not apply to public schools. If passed, the new tax would affect about 70 elite private colleges, though it would not touch the type of offshore benefits the Texan partnership pursued.College and university endowment earnings are usually tax-exempt. But as endowments have sought greater investment returns in recent years, they have shifted more of their money out of traditional holdings like United States equities to alternative, potentially more lucrative investments. These include private equity and hedge funds that frequently borrow money, opening them up to tax consequences.When schools earn income from enterprises unrelated to their core educational missions, they can be required to pay a tax that was intended to prevent nonprofits from competing unfairly with for-profit businesses.Establishing another corporate layer between private equity funds and endowments effectively blocks any taxable income from flowing to the endowments, the reason they are called blocker corporations. The tax is instead owed by the corporations, which are established in no-tax or low-tax jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands.The use of blocker corporations has raised concerns among policymakers in recent years. That\u2019s partly because they cost the United States Treasury millions of dollars, but also because they legitimize an opaque offshore network sometimes used for nefarious purposes.\u201cThey\u2019re not cheating. They\u2019re not hiding money or disguising money,\u201d said Samuel Brunson, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago who has studied endowment taxation. \u201cBut they\u2019re adding money to a system that allows people, if they want to hide their money, to do it.\u201d Not only do the universities benefit \u2014 so does the wealthy and influential private equity industry.Perhaps illustrating the sensitivity of the topic, officials at most of the college and university endowments that use blocker corporations, including Colgate, Dartmouth, Duke and Stanford, declined to comment specifically, citing longstanding policies against discussing their investments. Among them was Matt Kavgian, the director of strategic communications for Indiana University\u2019s $2 billion endowment, which had invested $10 million with Quintana.An exception was the Quintana shareholder Texas Christian University, whose chief investment officer, Jim Hille, acknowledged that the $1.5 billion endowment had used blocker corporations. Mr. Hille said the decision to use one often came down to whether the expected return would offset the cost of establishing a blocker corporation.H&F Investors Blocker was formed to invest with one of the largest private equity firms, Hellman & Friedman, in shares of Axel Springer, a German publisher of newspapers and magazines.Minutes from meetings at Appleby\u2019s office in Hamilton, Bermuda, never mention tax avoidance or even explain why the word \u201cblocker\u201d is used in the partnership\u2019s title. But an audit by Ernst & Young, contained in the minutes, shows that H&F Investors Blocker would owe no federal income tax.By 2008, the University of Texas system \u2014 whose endowment last year was $24.2 billion, behind Harvard\u2019s ($34.5 billion) and Yale\u2019s ($25.4 billion) \u2014 asked Appleby to set up a Cayman Islands company called TX Liquidity Capital so \u201ccertain tax advantages will accrue to the system,\u201d documents show.Colgate University, with an endowment worth $822 million last year, stood to benefit from blocker corporations in 2008 when it invested in Genstar Capital, a private equity fund specializing in leveraged buyouts, according to the records. One investor in that Cayman Islands partnership, called Genstar Capital Partners V HV, took pains to include a handwritten a note near his signature: \u201celect to invest through the blocker.\u201d Other investors were Dartmouth, Stanford and a Duke fund called Gothic Corporation.While legal, blocker corporations are part of a system of endowment tax breaks fueling an undercurrent of populist anger. Many students across the country struggle under massive college debt. At the same time, critics say, some wealthy schools use these tax advantages to stockpile endowments that exceed the gross national product of entire countries.Last year, three influential Republican legislators, led by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, sent a letter to 56 private universities with endowments of $1 billion or more, requesting information on \u201cthe numerous tax preferences\u201d they enjoy. \u201cDespite these large and growing endowments,\u201d the letter said, \u201cmany colleges and universities have raised tuition far in excess of inflation.\u201d\u201cIn some ways, the anti-elite and anti-university spirit of Trumpism could create a favorable environment on Capitol Hill for some kind of action on this,\u201d Dr. Eaton said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason universities urgently need to grapple with this. Because people genuinely feel that our elite universities have become islands of wealth.\u201dMultiple Appleby documents offer a glimpse into the complex financial transactions and investments, some controversial, that university endowments engage in all over the world, aside from using blockers.Universities have been under pressure from both students and activists to shift to \u201cgreen\u201d investments in response to climate change, as well as to take social policy and global governance issues into account in investments.The Appleby records show that investment funds of Columbia and Duke, both ranked in the top 20 endowments, held shares as recently as 2015 in Ferrous Resources, registered in the Isle of Man. Its primary business is iron mining in Brazil.The company drew criticism there with a planned 480 kilometer pipeline to transport iron slurry from a mine in Minas Gerais to a port.\u201cMajor demonstrations took place against this project, which culminated in the creation of a campaign,\u2019\u201d researchers wrote in a 2015 paper published in the journal Society & Nature.A 2010 environmental study of the pipeline revealed that more than 110,000 people might be affected by noise, dust, soil degradation and water quality issues. The project was postponed in 2012 after a downturn in iron prices.The company, Ferrous Resources, declined to comment, except to say that the project had been discontinued.Columbia, which owned more than eight million shares in Ferrous Recources, or 1.1 percent of the company, declined to comment. Various investment funds connected to Duke, which also declined to comment, held more than two million shares in the company.While some schools have announced shifts away from controversial investments, others have pointed out that divesting from fossil fuels would probably lead to a significant drop in operating funds.Underscoring endowments\u2019 reliance on hydrocarbon holdings, 10 schools invested in a Cayman Islands partnership in 2012 known as EnCap Energy Capital Fund IX-C, part of EnCap Investments, a private equity firm known for the acquisition and development of North American oil and gas properties.Among the investors were the University of Alabama, DePauw, Northeastern, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Reed College, Rutgers, Syracuse, Texas Tech and Washington State.Advertisement"}

Pour le comprendre, il faut remonter \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de trois si\u00e8cles. Vers 1744 un chef tribal, Mohammed Ibn Saoud, s\u2019allie avec un pr\u00eacheur ultraconservateur du nom de Mohammed Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab pour cr\u00e9er le premier \u00e9tat monarchique de la p\u00e9ninsule arabe. D\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, la famille des Saoud, qui g\u00e8rera le pays par droit de sang et de succession; de l\u2019autre, le wahhabisme, une version extra-puritaine et extr\u00eame de l\u2019Islam dit des origines. Une famille et un clerg\u00e9, donc, soud\u00e9s au fil des d\u00e9cennies autant par la rente p\u00e9troli\u00e8re que par la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 que conf\u00e8re au r\u00e9gime sa proximit\u00e9 aux lieux les plus sacr\u00e9s de l\u2019Islam.Aujourd\u2019hui, ce wahhabisme est aussi, bien s\u00fbr, une des matrices du djihadisme mondial: une source de puissance id\u00e9ologique et financi\u00e8re pour les islamistes et leur constellation de mosqu\u00e9es fondamentalistes, cha\u00eenes de t\u00e9l\u00e9visions consacr\u00e9es aux pr\u00e9dications et divers partis politiques partout dans le monde musulman. L\u2019Arabie saoudite nourrit donc la main qui la tue peu \u00e0 peu, et d\u2019autres avec elle.Des r\u00e9formes en Arabie saoudite sont donc n\u00e9cessaires d\u00e9sormais \u2014 mais tout autant elles semblent impossibles. Comment la famille royale pourra-t-elle se d\u00e9barrasser du soutien du clerg\u00e9, stopper le financement des r\u00e9seaux radicaux et engager de v\u00e9ritables r\u00e9volutions soci\u00e9tales? L\u2019\u00e9quilibre du royaume est en jeu et, du m\u00eame fait, celui de toute la r\u00e9gion.Quel que soit l\u2019effet r\u00e9el de ces changements en Arabie saoudite, ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 des r\u00e9percussions ailleurs. Si le pays, m\u00e8re des fatwas, r\u00e9forme, les islamistes du monde entier ne peuvent que suivre ou se placer du mauvais c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019orthodoxie.En Alg\u00e9rie, par exemple, le malaise des salafistes se ressent subrepticement. Sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, c\u2019est la th\u00e9orie du complot qui semble dominer: on voit dans le coup d\u2019\u00e9clat de MBS le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une injonction am\u00e9ricaine. Mais les journaux conservateurs et les \u00e9ditorialistes islamistes, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tr\u00e8s fervents de ce qui vient du royaume et prompts \u00e0 commenter toute atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019Islam, gardent le silence cette fois, ou ne d\u00e9fendent le wahhabisme que timidement. Dans les mosqu\u00e9es, c\u2019est plut\u00f4t le silence aussi.Il faut savoir qu\u2019en Alg\u00e9rie, les islamistes sont de deux familles. L\u2019une, qui se veut ancestrale et pure, se revendique de l\u2019Arabie saoudite et de la Fatwa Valley. Elle est inqui\u00e9t\u00e9e par les r\u00e9formes de MBS car celles-ci signifient peut-\u00eatre un prochain tarissement de financement et une perte de l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9.L\u2019autre branche est d\u2019ob\u00e9dience Fr\u00e8res musulmans et proche de la Turquie du premier ministre Recep Tayyip Erdogan, et elle prend la forme de partis politiques islamistes tol\u00e9r\u00e9s par le r\u00e9gime alg\u00e9rien. Mais ses membres aussi sont inquiets: si l\u2019Arabie r\u00e9forme, ils perdent leur vitrine d\u2019islamistes tol\u00e9rants et du m\u00eame fait leur place dans l\u2019\u00e9chiquier politique ici. Le prince saoudien, en se pr\u00e9sentant comme plus mod\u00e9r\u00e9 que les mod\u00e9r\u00e9s d\u2019ailleurs, leur coupe \u00e0 tous l\u2019herbe sous les pieds.Les uns comme les autres ressentent ainsi l\u2019angoisse de l\u2019orphelin. La tendance mod\u00e9r\u00e9e, prise de court, va peut-\u00eatre essayer de rattraper l\u2019avance du prince. Mais la tendance fondamentaliste, priv\u00e9e de ses rep\u00e8res, risque de se retourner contre le royaume saoudien afin de se cr\u00e9er une nouvelle l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 \u2014 en faisant, en quelque sorte, une guerre sainte \u00e0 la terre sainte.Kamel Daoud est l\u2019auteur du roman \u201cMeursault, contre-enqu\u00eate\u201d et du recueil de chroniques \u201cMes ind\u00e9pendances.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Silicon Valley Gets \u2018Crazy,\u2019 Midwest Beckons Tech Investors", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey are by no means the only notable investors seeking opportunity in the region.Four years ago, Mark Kvamme, a top venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, left the heart of the tech industry to become a tech investor here in the Midwest heartland.\u201cSilicon Valley is kind of crazy now,\u201d Mr. Kvamme said.The money, power and influence of tech companies on the West Coast have reached new heights. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are now the four most valuable companies in the country.But some investors, led by people like Mr. Kvamme and his firm, Drive Capital, see plenty of potential in the center of the country. Focusing on the Midwest is no longer considered a nutty idea, as it was by skeptical West Coast venture capitalists when Mr. Kvamme and Chris Olsen, another Silicon Valley transplant from Sequoia Capital and co-founder of Drive Capital, made the move in 2013.Every major Midwestern city now has clusters of start-up accelerators and incubators, typically housed in renovated red-brick industrial buildings.Deals like those are still rare. But local entrepreneurs and big investors are scouting the Midwest for start-up investments that range up to tens of millions of dollars, far more than local angel and venture investors. And they are beginning to attract venture capital from Silicon Valley for follow-on rounds of funding.The rationale for investing in the Midwest combines cost and opportunity. A top-flight software engineer who is paid $100,000 a year in the Midwest might well command $200,000 or more in the Bay Area. The Midwest, the optimists say, also has ample tech talent, with excellent engineers coming out of major state and private universities in the region.But they also point to technology shifts. As technology transforms nontech industries like health care, agriculture, transportation, finance and manufacturing, the Midwest investors argue that being close to customers will be more important than being close to the wellspring of technology.\u201cThe value will come from marrying industry knowledge with technology,\u201d said Mr. Olsen of Drive Capital. \u201cThere\u2019s an arrogance in Silicon Valley that we don\u2019t need industry expertise. That\u2019s going to be less and less true in the future.\u201d\u201cThere are two Americas,\u201d Mr. Case said. \u201cOne with an abundance of capital and opportunity \u2014 in Silicon Valley and pockets around the nation. But not in the other America, and that other America is most of the country.\u201dMr. Case served on White House advisory councils on jobs, innovation and entrepreneurship during the Obama administration, and that experience, he said, shaped his thinking about investing in the Midwest. Since 2011, his firm has raised more than $1 billion for two funds, Revolution Ventures and Revolution Growth, which generally make investments of $4 million to $50 million, including in start-ups in the Midwest.Both Mr. Case and Mr. Vance, whose career path went through the Marines, Ohio State University and Yale Law School and then to a Silicon Valley venture firm, view building businesses as a social virtue as well.Referring to the troubles chronicled in his book, Mr. Vance said that \u201cat least a partial solution is to get more investment capital into this part of the country.\u201dThe firm also sponsors road trips in a colorfully painted bus that it calls Rise of the Rest, also the name of Revolution\u2019s new $100 million investment fund. Mr. Case and members of his team leave Revolution\u2019s base in Washington, D.C., to visit and champion emerging start-up communities in cities across the country. Since 2014, there have been six such tours, and the most recent one ended last month after stops in central Pennsylvania; Ann Arbor, Mich.; Indianapolis; Columbus; and Green Bay, Wis.The days are packed with meetings with local entrepreneurs, investors, corporate executives, government officials, educators and social service workers. Each day ends with a pitch contest, where eight to 10 start-ups present their companies and business plans.The winner in each city receives a check for $100,000, a personal investment from Mr. Case. So far, he has handed out more than $4 million in the local contests.The day in Columbus was typical. There were seven stops, including three start-up hubs, with Mr. Case and Mr. Vance listening and speaking at each location.Mr. Case and Mr. Vance talk of the need to create \u201cnetwork density\u201d by bringing together more entrepreneurs, customers, partners and investment capital. The trips can and do yield investment candidates for Revolution, but start-up evangelism is the main theme.In Ohio, that $35 million is the equivalent of $70 million in the Valley in terms of being able to hire talent and sustain operating costs, said Sean Lane, CrossChx\u2019s co-founder and chief executive.\u201cI\u2019m not sure we would have made it through the zigs and zags if we were in the Valley,\u201d Mr. Lane said.CrossChx is one of more than two dozen companies in Drive Capital\u2019s portfolio. To date, none have folded, and they are generating more than $150 million in revenue. After three years \u2014 its first fund started investing in 2014 \u2014 the firm\u2019s gains look good on paper. But it is too early to declare its Midwest bet a success.That will take a few more years, and the proof will be if it delivers high returns to its limited-partner investors. \u201cAnd if two guys from Silicon Valley and Sequoia can\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Olsen said, \u201ccapital isn\u2019t going to come here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The effort also aims to reduce the fragmentation of European military spending and to promote more joint projects to reduce duplication and waste.At a signing ceremony in Brussels, the European foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, called the deal a \u201chistoric moment in European defense.\u201dJean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister and a former defense minister, said the agreement was \u201ca commitment for countries to do better together,\u201d noting that it \u201ccomes at a time of significant tension\u201d in Europe stemming from a more aggressive Russia after the annexation of Crimea, and from terrorist attacks by Islamist militants.Ms. Merkel did add, however, that European coordination should be taken in partnership with the United States and Britain.For years, Britain blocked this kind of cooperation, concerned that the creation of a European army would undermine NATO and London\u2019s alliance with Washington. Britain instead favored a bilateral arrangement with France.Paris had argued for a smaller group of countries that would commit to serious spending on military equipment and capabilities, which Europe mostly lacks outside of NATO, while Berlin argued for a bigger club. France, which will become the most important military power in the European Union after Britain departs, wants to be able to conduct operations in places like Mali with European allies without necessarily having to ask NATO for help.The German view, as is often the case, won out.The agreement, known in Brussels-speak as \u201cpermanent structured cooperation,\u201d or Pesco, is expected to be formalized by European leaders at a summit meeting in mid-December. But with so many foreign and defense ministers signing on Monday, approval seems a given.NATO is also supportive of the effort, as European leaders say their intention is not to undermine the Atlantic alliance but simply to act more efficiently on European missions against, for instance, piracy, cyberattacks or hybrid warfare like in Crimea.Countries would submit a plan of action outlining their military goals, which would be monitored, and national assets would remain under national control. A European Union fund of about 5 billion euros, or $5.8 billion, would be used to buy weapons, with another special fund to finance operations.The European Union member states that did not sign the new military agreement were Britain, Denmark, Ireland, Malta and Portugal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration to Lift Ban on \u2018Trophy\u2019 Elephant Imports", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration will begin allowing hunters to bring into the United States \u201ctrophy\u201d elephants killed in Zimbabwe, reversing a 2014 ban on a practice that has received intense scrutiny in recent years.Though African elephants are protected under the Endangered Species Act, the law allows the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to authorize imports of trophies if the agency finds that the hunts in which the animals were killed contribute to the survival of the species.The United States banned such imports from Zimbabwe in 2014 because of a lack of data on conservation efforts there. Now the United States agency says it is satisfied with Zimbabwe\u2019s actions and believes such hunts can be beneficial for the species by bringing money to local communities and providing incentives to conserve elephants.\u201cSince our 2014 and 2015 findings, there are strong indications that the efforts of private landowners and consortiums to manage elephants within their areas of control have received greater support,\u201d the federal agency said in a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Friday.The Zimbabwean government, it added, was contributing to efforts to combat poaching and working with partners to improve elephant management.The reversal of the ban comes less than two weeks after the agency moved to allow imports from Zambia. Both decisions generally apply to elephants hunted in either country between 2016 and 2018. Hunters are allowed two imports per year.That project found that Zambia and Zimbabwe have had mixed success in maintaining or growing their elephant populations. Parks near countries with poor elephant preservation efforts were not doing well, for example. But elephant populations elsewhere were stable or increasing.Trophy tourism in Africa has come under high-profile scrutiny in recent years.The group had joined the National Rifle Association in suing the federal government over the 2014 ban and said that it would continue to challenge that decision so hunters can retrieve trophies from hunts that are still excluded.\u201cWhat kind of message does it send to say to the world that poor Africans who are struggling to survive cannot kill elephants in order to use or sell their parts to make a living, but that it\u2019s just fine for rich Americans to slay the beasts for their tusks to keep as trophies?\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Subway Ridership Falls as M.T.A. Scrambles to Improve Service", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHave some New York City subway riders had enough?The increase in ridership was so dramatic that officials often blamed overcrowding for contributing to the rising number of delays in a century-old system that is ill equipped to deal with the demand.But recently, those ridership numbers have been heading in the other direction: down.Despite an increase in the population and in the number of new jobs, average weekday subway ridership dropped to 5.712 million this September from 5.817 million in September 2016, according to figures released this week by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\u201cHistorically, ridership numbers rise and fall with employment: when more people are working, more people ride public transit,\u201d said John Raskin, the executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group. \u201cA drop in ridership during a booming economy is an indicator of a transit system in crisis. People need to get to work and they are finding that public transit isn\u2019t getting them there. As a result, New Yorkers are voting with their MetroCards: they are starting to abandon an unreliable transit system and look for steadier, more comfortable alternatives.\u201dStill, other factors may have contributed to the decline, including changing work habits and transportation alternatives like ride-hailing apps and CitiBike, the shared biking service.Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, told reporters on Wednesday, that ridership had not declined during the morning and afternoon rush, leading him to believe that the drop was more related to lifestyle, rather than poor service.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t working for the man anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are working for themselves.\u201dJon Weinstein, a spokesman for the authority, said that an emergency repair plan that was started earlier this year was meant to improve subway service.\u201cAt roughly 5.7 million rides a day, New York City subway ridership is still near historic highs \u2014 and we are stabilizing the system through Subway Action Plan so riders have the reliability they deserve,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said.Above ground, the decline in ridership has been even steeper. The number of people riding the bus this September fell to 1.946 million from 2.087 in September of last year.Transit officials said that decline was driven in part by a generational shift, with younger New Yorkers less likely to ride the bus. But increased traffic on the city\u2019s streets was also to blame, often slowing bus service to a crawl.Average vehicle speeds in Manhattan below 60th Street have declined 12 percent from 2010 to 2015, according to the city\u2019s Department of Transportation.Robert E. Foran, the authority\u2019s chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that if the city did not kick in its share, \u201cthe plan will be scaled back.\u201dThe decline in ridership will only add to the transportation authority\u2019s financial burden.At the authority\u2019s board meeting on Wednesday, the agency said that declines in bus and subway ridership, along with lower toll fare collections than forecast, will result in a $281 million shortfall in its budget projections for 2018 to 2021.\u201cThese numbers show there is a clear need to implement some form of congestion pricing to help make buses faster and for a radical overhaul of the subway system to bring it into the 21st century,\u201d said Dani Simons, a spokeswoman for the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy organization. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019ll see riders shifting to other modes that provide the speed, reliability and modern experience they are looking for.\u201dEven if the authority is able to reduce costs and find a new source of funding, officials said that they might still need to increase fares and tolls.Mr. Lhota said that nothing had been decided on fares.\u201cRight now, we are still looking at a less than the rate of inflation increase in 2019,\u201d he said, referring to fares. \u201cIf the revenues come in sooner rather than later and we don\u2019t need the increase, that is a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company faces a variety of regulations as it prepares to do business in the area, which has a population of more than seven million people. Mississauga, the largest of Toronto\u2019s suburbs and home to the area\u2019s international airport, has let Uber operate only on a trial basis since March and plans to review its rules in 2019.Uber has \u201cupended the taxi industry\u201d in Toronto since its arrival and has achieved a great deal of popularity and commercial success, but it nevertheless remains \u201ccontroversial and contentious,\u201d said Shauna Brail, the director of the urban studies program at the University of Toronto.Professor Brail said it was unclear what impact Lyft\u2019s entry into the local market would have. But she noted that the city was growing in importance as a center for research into artificial intelligence, an important technology in the self-driving cars that Lyft and others are working to develop.Uber has been trying to repair its image, with Dara Khosrowshahi, the new chief executive, pushing a softer tone and a set of cultural values that includes the maxim, \u201cWe do the right thing.

{"Headline": "The House and Senate Still Have Very Different Tax Bills. Here\u2019s How They Compare.", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tax cut bill that the House passed on Thursday differs significantly from the Senate version in several areas, including the timing and permanence of the tax cuts and its treatment of the Affordable Care Act.The Senate, which is expected to pass its bill through the Senate Finance Committee on Friday, will eventually have to rectify its differences with the House bill.Republicans originally wanted to collapse the tax brackets to three, from seven, in part to achieve their goal of simplifying the tax code so that people could file on a postcard. That proved difficult. The House plan went with four brackets: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and a top rate that stays at 39.6 percent for millionaires.The Senate bill sticks with seven brackets of 10 percent, 12 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 32 percent and 35 percent but lowers the top rate to 38.5 percent for high income individuals and couples.The House bill cuts the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent immediately and makes the cut permanent. Individual income tax cuts are also made permanent in the House bill.The Senate plan delays implementation of the corporate tax cut until 2019 and most of the tax cuts for individuals would expire in 2025.One of the biggest differences between the House and Senate plans is that Senate Republicans decided to repeal the health law\u2019s requirement that most people purchase health insurance. This saves more than $300 billion and allows Republicans to claim success in their longstanding goal of dismantling part of the Affordable Care Act. The House bill contains no such provision, but the inclusion is not expected to cause much of a kerfuffle among the majority of House Republicans.The House bill eliminates the popular deduction for state and local income and sales taxes paid and only allows a deduction for property taxes, which are capped at $10,000. The provision prompted the defection of 13 House Republicans from New York New Jersey, California and North Carolina, who voted against the tax bill over concerns it would raise taxes for their constituents.The Senate plan eliminates the so-called SALT deduction entirely.The House bill caps the deduction for mortgage interest debt at $500,000, down from the current cap of $1 million.Senate Republicans have decided to leave the deduction alone. If that holds, it would be a big victory for real estate lobbyists, who have been vocal in their opposition to changing the deduction, but that could make the House bill even more expensive.Republicans are united in their desire to give small businesses a tax break, but their plans differ in how to provide a tax cut. House lawmakers created a new 25 percent tax for so-called pass-through businesses \u2014 sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate of their owners. However, they erected guardrails to prevent the new rate from becoming a loophole that wealthy individuals can exploit by converting themselves into entities and flowing their income through at the rate of 25 percent.The Senate takes a different approach, creating a new deduction for pass-through businesses along with other incentives to promote investment. The Senate bill also sets an expiration date on breaks for so-called pass-through businesses, whose owners pay taxes on profits through the tax code for individuals.To cut business and individual tax rates and double the standard deduction for individuals and families, Republicans had to do away with many popular tax credits and other prized deductions. The House initially eliminated a tax credit for adoptions but later restored it. It also repeals deductions for medical expenses and counts tuition waivers that are widely used by graduate students as taxable income.In the Senate, Republicans also preserve the adoption tax credit. Unlike the House, they maintain the deduction for medical expenses and provide \u201ceducation relief\u201d for graduate students.Almost all Republicans agree philosophically that the estate tax \u2014 or death tax as they call it \u2014 is unfair. But repealing it is costly, and the tax tends to only hit the very wealthy (and their heirs). House Republicans decided in their bill to double the amount of inherited wealth that is exempt from the tax to $11 million, from $5.5 million, and phase out the tax after six years. In a late amendment, they moved to delay its full repeal another year, to 2025.In the Senate, the exemption is also doubled, but the death tax never dies.Advertisement"}

In 2011, Mr. Banderet said he had spotted \u201ca geyser of oil shooting straight up in the air\u201d from a Keystone pumping station near his property. He found the response by TransCanada to be flat-footed and opaque.\u201cAs far as transparency, in my eyes they get a failing grade,\u201d Mr. Banderet said.\u201cThey\u2019re certainly not the worst, they\u2019re certainly not the best,\u201d said Carl Weimer, executive director of the Pipeline Safety Trust, an industry watchdog group.The concern, Mr. Weimer said, is that the \u201cpipeline is not very old.\u201dAbout 75 TransCanada workers and contractors were at the site on Friday, along with federal and state regulators, to begin a lengthy cleanup that will include the excavation of part of the pipeline.\u201cI would think it\u2019s probably weeks for sure,\u201d said Brian Walsh, an environmental scientist with the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Mr. Walsh said that the spill had been contained and that there was no immediate risk to drinking water or residents.Ed Hirs, a finance lecturer at the University of Houston and a partner in a small oil company, said it appeared TransCanada was responding appropriately by releasing information and sending workers to clean up.\u201cThe first thing they want to do is minimize any impact,\u201d Mr. Hirs said. \u201cThey\u2019re out there racing around to get this done and mitigate the impact of this disaster.\u201dDespite several requests, TransCanada did not make any executives available for comment.

Now, new questions suggest that their story may have run off course, too.When asked during a routine debriefing why they never used the beacon, the women told the Coast Guard that their situation never seemed dire enough.\u201cThey stated that while they felt distressed they did not feel that they were going to perish in the next 24 hours,\u201d said Lt. Cmdr. Scott Carr, a Coast Guard spokesman.Weather records, however, contradict that claim. No organized thunderstorms moved through the area at the time, said Charlie Woodrum, a National Weather Service meteorologist based in Honolulu.There was a small-craft advisory in the area, he said, but it warned only of wind speeds below 35 miles per hour. Ms. Appel said that they had faced a \u201cforce 11\u201d storm, which would have carried winds of 64 to 72 miles per hour.\u201cIn May, a force 11 storm is extremely rare,\u201d Mr. Woodrum said.The A.P. also raised doubts about the women\u2019s claims that their boat would not fit in some Hawaiian harbors, which it noted were frequented by larger vessels.The women also described a couple of disturbing shark attacks.But there is little credibility to those descriptions, said George Burgess, the director emeritus of the Florida Program for Shark Research at the Florida Museum of Natural History.\u201cIt sounds like something a 4-year-old would tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cNo. No, no and no and no. There\u2019s not an iota of accuracy relative to our knowledge of the shark in any of that.\u201dTiger sharks are not social, do not teach their young in that way and have never been known to grow that large, he said. When asked, Mr. Burgess added that it was also unlikely that the women were describing another type of shark.\u201cThe only one that fits that pattern was the star of the movie \u2018Jaws,\u2019\u201d he said.Many people familiar with sailing immediately voiced doubts online about the ordeal the women described.Among them was Linus Wilson, a professor of finance at the University of Louisiana who blogs about sailing and has written books about his experience sailing around various parts of the world.\u201cIt just does not seem believable that if you had a boat with a mast upright, and Ms. Appel said they could sail 4 to 5 knots, that they could not reach land,\u201d he said.The women debarked the Navy ship that rescued them on Monday in Okinawa, Japan.

{"Headline": "Trump Halted These Hunt Trophies. Elephant Lovers Will Never Forget It.", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Maybe it was the memory of a long-ago childhood visit to the zoo. Maybe it was a sense of loyalty to the symbol of his political party.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of shock that this president and this administration would roll back a decision on trophy hunting like this,\u201d said Tanya Sanerib, a senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, which fights to protect species threatened with extinction. \u201cBut there\u2019s something about elephants that just crosses party lines. They get to people.\u201dAides said it was no more complicated than that. The president likes elephants, they said. He did not know about his administration\u2019s decision to lift the trophy ban until learning it from the news media and was annoyed to be criticized for a move he had no part in. So he made his displeasure known in the way he has so many other times this year, through his Twitter feed.As it happened, his decision also coincided with the sentiments of conservative media personalities like Michael Savage, Laura Ingraham and Mike Cernovich, who have defended Mr. Trump through a cascade of controversies this year but protested the administration\u2019s initial announcement.\u201cThe ruling was absurd,\u201d Ms. Ingraham, the Fox News host who has been considered for a job in the Trump administration, said on Monday. \u201cWho could ever shoot these majestic creatures?\u201d Ms. Ingraham called herself \u201ca conservationist\u201d who has been to Botswana three times, including this past summer with her children.Mr. Trump is not a hunter, unlike his sons Donald Jr. and Eric. In 2012, photographs were posted online of the two men posing with several dead animals during a safari in Zimbabwe, including one that showed Donald Trump Jr. holding a knife in one hand and a severed elephant tail in the other.Lara Trump, Eric\u2019s wife, on the other hand, has become a vocal animal rights advocate and the Humane Society of the United States said she brought up the elephant trophy issue during meetings on Capitol Hill last Thursday. She and her husband visited the White House on Friday, but advisers to the president said they did not know whether the issue came up.On the other side, the National Rifle Association, another supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s, had hailed the lifting of the ban, calling it \u201ca significant step forward in having hunting receive the recognition it deserves as a tool of sound wildlife management.\u201dIt was not the first time Mr. Trump has announced an unexpected policy shift via Twitter but wildlife service veterans could not remember a president stepping in so late in the process.\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented, especially once it\u2019s been published in the Federal Register Service,\u201d said Dan Ashe, the former director of the Fish and Wildlife Service who stepped down in January after 22 years with the agency. \u201cIt puts the Fish and Wildlife Service in an awkward procedural position.\u201dMr. Ashe, now president of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said he was surprised not only at the president\u2019s intervention but at the timing of the agency\u2019s recommendation.\u201cThis administration has not yet found a voice on the wildlife trafficking epidemic, which is what is driving elephants and other animals into extinction,\u201d Mr. Ashe said. \u201cI would\u2019ve hoped, and maybe expected, that they would have first found a voice on the larger issue of wildlife trafficking before they ventured into trophy hunting.\u201dIndeed, the uncertainty generated by the president\u2019s involvement prompted a lawsuit on Monday by two environmental groups, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Natural Resources Defense Council, citing confusion over the administration\u2019s position. Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet may only suspend permit evaluation without putting the ban back in place, they said.\u201cPutting trophy imports \u2018on hold\u2019 isn\u2019t enough,\u201d said Elly Pepper, deputy director of wildlife trade for the resources council. \u201cIf we don\u2019t force the administration to completely revoke its decision, President Trump could quietly start allowing these imports as soon as he stops facing criticism on Twitter.\u201dThe other side of the debate rallied as well. The Safari Club International sent out a \u201ccall to arms\u201d last weekend, asking more than 50,000 members to lobby Mr. Trump and Mr. Zinke to stand by the decision to lift the ban, blaming the \u201cshrill, negative reactions\u201d of anti-hunters and media outlets.\u201cYou don\u2019t hear a lot of hunters stepping out,\u201d said Paul Babaz, the organization\u2019s president. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage hunters to step out, to have a voice.\u201dJeremy W.

{"Headline": "As Kenyatta is Inaugurated, Kenyans Are Feeling Economic Pain", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Florence Makau once made $10 a day selling used clothes from inside a former shipping container, enough to feed her three children, pay their school fees and cover the rent. That was during better times in Kibera, a crowded working-class Nairobi neighborhood.Times are no longer that good in Kibera \u2014 or elsewhere in Kenya. Government institutions blame drought and rising oil prices, but another reason has afflicted Kenyans across the socioeconomic spectrum: Politics.Kenya endured an unexpectedly long and volatile election period, capped on Tuesday when Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in for a second term as president. Many hope his inauguration will end the country\u2019s political uncertainty, but much economic damage has already been done.\u201cIt\u2019s a lost year. Completely,\u201d said Emma Gordon, a senior analyst for sub-Saharan Africa at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk assessment firm.Investors know election season means an economic slowdown, and that the slump usually starts well before voting day. But this year Kenya conducted two presidential elections, nearly three months apart, because of an unprecedented Supreme Court ruling.Throughout, Kenya\u2019s economy has taken a significant hit.Kenya welcomed 15 percent fewer visitors in August \u2014 the month of the first presidential vote, also the peak of the tourist season and a crucial driver of the country\u2019s economy \u2014 than in July. Figures compiled monthly by Kenya\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics show the country\u2019s other major industries suffering as well. Key manufacturing indicators fell an average of nearly 20 percent compared with the same period last year. The agriculture sector also suffered, although the statistics bureau attributed that to drought.Kenya\u2019s Finance Ministry now expects economic growth of 5 percent this year, almost a full percentage point lower than its initial forecast.Official figures, however, hardly tell the whole story.\u201cThose numbers mask how much this affected your average Joe in Kenya,\u201d said Ms. Gordon, the analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s not been a good period for the average working Kenyan.\u201dThat is partly because women like Ms. Makau, the clothing seller in Kibera, are ignored in the government\u2019s figures, which do not measure the \u201cinformal economy\u201d composed of people who work as street vendors, drivers and casual laborers.Ms. Makau, 60, is feeling the stress. Her onetime daily income of $10 is now $5, if she\u2019s lucky. She is paying her rent piecemeal so that she does not have to skimp even more on meals for her children. Finding trendy fashions to hawk is a thing of the past.\u201cThe good stuff is gone,\u201d she said, sitting in her shop, a repurposed shipping container filled with faded castoffs she cannot sell. With virtually no revenue, she lacks the cash to buy new stock in styles her customers want.Across Kibera, Kawangware and Mathare \u2014 Nairobi neighborhoods that are home to hundreds of thousands of the working poor \u2014 people say there\u2019s just no money. And when pockets are empty, fruit and vegetables, and the investment they represent, rot on vendors\u2019 stands.Ritchie Oudu, who makes the bulk of his income selling DVDs in Kibera, has been unable to get new movies in three months. His suppliers, based in downtown Nairobi, are too afraid to visit the slums. He\u2019s dipping into his dwindling savings to pay university fees.Things are not much better in Nairobi\u2019s central business district. Small- and medium-sized retailers there say the prolonged election and frequent and sometimes violent political demonstrations drove customers away and provoked fears of vandalism.The election violence is not limited to street fights between ordinary Kenyans, who are usually paid a dollar or less to show support for one side or another. One businesswoman said clients at her men\u2019s wear shop frequently argued over politics. In one case, she said, two customers with opposing views came to blows.There are some signs of change. As Mr. Kenyatta prepared for his inauguration, Mr. Odinga canceled plans by his party to hold a parallel swearing-in of its \u201cpeople\u2019s president.\u201d But he later turned the tables, promising supporters at a rally that he would take such an oath next month, on the anniversary of Kenya\u2019s independence.Mr. Odinga\u2019s speech was cut short by police firing tear gas and, witnesses say, bullets. Members of Mr. Odinga\u2019s party say five people were shot, and two killed, during the afternoon\u2019s chaos.The skirmish, and Mr. Odinga\u2019s promise of continued provocation, undid feelings of relief in a city where many people, whatever their politics, say they simply want normality.Ms. Makau, the clothes seller, said she has no idea when she\u2019ll have enough money to restock. Mr. Oudu, 27, is still single, in a country where men are often married by that age, but says he lacks enough cash to date girls. Anna Mwenda, who sells phone credit in downtown Nairobi, cannot afford Christmas gifts for her five-year-old son, or the traditional holiday visit to see her family in rural Kenya.Jeremy Maganga, a 45-year-old scrap dealer in Kibera, said it is unclear when family life will feel normal again. He and his wife have found new weekend routines to avoid guests \u2014 and the social expectation of sharing food. Mr. Maganga sits at work Saturdays, though there\u2019s little business, and on Sundays after church, he and his wife and children loiter away from home.\u201cNormally we need visitors,\u201d he said, expressing an appreciation for the drop-ins that are common here. \u201cBut now, we reduce food at home by cutting them out. We cannot welcome anyone.\u201dTo say such a thing in Kenya is to admit both shame and defeat. Those feelings follow Mr. Maganga everywhere these days; he\u2019s even taken to dodging his wife and children, spending extra-long hours at work and hoping they are asleep when he comes home.He spends a few Kenyan shillings \u2014 no more than a dime or two \u2014 on mandaazi, a popular fried dough snack, for the children, just in case they are awake. It is his attempt, these days, at not disappointing them.\u201cThey\u2019re angry at me,\u201d he said of his family, \u201cthat I cannot provide.\u201dLenny Ruvaga contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Upper West Side School Zones Changed, but Not All Parents Went Along", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA year later, with data available on the first class of kindergartners enrolled, the results of the rezoning are mixed.The three schools most affected by the rezoning were Public School 191, P.S. 199 and P.S. 452. For years, P.S. 191 had served a housing project, Amsterdam Houses, and its students were largely poor, black and Hispanic. P.S. 199, considered by many wealthy families to be one of the most desirable schools in Manhattan, was largely white and increasingly overcrowded. P.S. 452, which opened in 2010, had similar demographics as P.S. 199.In a complex dance, the catchment areas of all three schools were redrawn and two of the schools moved. P.S. 191, formerly on West 61st Street, moved to a newly constructed building a block to the west, and P.S. 452 was moved from West 77th Street, where it shared a building with two other schools, to P.S. 191\u2019s previous building. In the process, Amsterdam Houses was divided among the three schools\u2019 zones, resulting in each zone being significantly more diverse. The hope was that P.S. 199 and P.S. 452 would gain more low-income students, and P.S. 191, with a fresh start in a new building, would attract more upper-middle-class and wealthy families.Of the three schools, P.S. 452 seems to have changed the most in terms of its demographics. This year\u2019s kindergarten class is 51 percent white; last year, it was 68 percent white. This year, 15 of 61 kindergartners are Hispanic, compared to fewer than 10 of the 66 kindergartners last year. When the numbers are that small, the Education Department does not release the precise figure. Fewer than 10 black students attended kindergarten in either year.The number of low-income students in kindergarten at P.S. 452, as measured by the department\u2019s formula, also increased: This year, 14 kindergarten students are poor compared to fewer than 10 last year.At P.S. 191, the results are not as clear. This year\u2019s kindergarten class increased to 50 students from 34 last year. Increasing enrollment at P.S. 191 was one of the goals of the rezoning.Whether the racial makeup in kindergarten changed, however, is difficult to know, with the number of white and Asian students so small both this year and last that the department withheld the data. The percentage of kindergarten students classified as low income, however, decreased to 74 percent this year from 82 percent last year.Of the three schools, P.S. 199 appears to have seen the least amount of change. The rezoning shrank P.S. 199\u2019s zone, and this year\u2019s kindergarten class, at 110 students, is smaller than last year\u2019s, at 135. But this year\u2019s class is also whiter than last year\u2019s group: 67 percent white compared to 61 percent. The total percentage of black and Hispanic students in kindergarten decreased to 10 from 14 last year. The number of low-income students increased, but by how much is unknown because the number last year was fewer than 10 and was therefore withheld.Mark Gonsalves owns an apartment at 165 West End Avenue, in a building that was shifted in the rezoning from P.S. 199 to P.S. 191. He has a son who was entering kindergarten this year, who has some learning disabilities. He said that after looking at both schools and consulting various experts, he decided that P.S. 199 was a better fit for his son. He said he was also concerned by the imbalance in the amount of money raised by P.S. 199\u2019s parent teacher association \u2014 nearly $800,000 in the 2015-16 school year \u2014 and P.S. 191\u2019s, which the department had no plan to address.\u201cThe superintendent basically said that the schools would be separate and unequal, and that did not jive well with me,\u201d Mr. Gonsalves said.In the end, he moved his family into a rental apartment in the new zone of P.S. 199, where his son now attends kindergarten.Andrew Chu\u2019s family was also rezoned from P.S. 199 to P.S. 191. He had enrolled his son in prekindergarten at P.S. 191 last year, and he and his wife decided to stick with the school this year. Mr. Chu joined the school leadership team and has been active in trying to recruit other parents to the school. He and other parents have helped organize a coding workshop for this year\u2019s third, seventh and eighth graders, financed by the local City Council member, Helen Rosenthal. He said that parents have also raised money in the hope of hiring a Mandarin teacher next year for prekindergarten and kindergarten, with the goal of offering the language to an additional grade each year.\u201cDemographically, if you look at our school versus 452 and 199, I think there\u2019s still a pretty disparate difference,\u201d he said. But he said he thought that new programs, like Mandarin and the coding classes, would appeal to parents.Recruitment is \u201cliterally family by family,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to build more momentum going into this year and into the next.\u201d\u201cJust as it can be intimidating to be the only white child in a class, it can also be intimidating to be the only child of color in a class,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this is going to work, both sides have to really think hard about how to make everybody feel welcome.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Bosses Show Up to Lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On Monday, Mick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, brought in doughnuts for employees. Around the same time, Leandra English, the agency\u2019s other acting director, sent an all-staff email thanking the work force for its service.Awkward.At a hurriedly called and packed-to-the-gills hearing, Judge Kelly voiced his concerns, noting that lawyers for the president could not definitively say whether Ms. English was protected from losing her job. The judge also said that neither set of attorneys had addressed whether Mr. Mulvaney, who is also the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, \u201ccan wear two hats.\u201dYet the judge remarked that he was essentially being asked by Deepak Gupta, Ms. English\u2019s lawyer, to overrule the president\u2019s power to appoint a new director.\u201cThat\u2019s an extraordinary remedy,\u201d Judge Kelly said, before asking Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers to respond to Ms. English\u2019s complaint with their own brief by the end of the evening.Others, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, reiterated that the bureau was meant to be independent from political influence. She defended Ms. English as the rightful director of the bureau that has helped nearly 30 million American consumers collect almost $12 billion in refunds and canceled debts.\u201cThe agency was built to be as far away from partisan politics as humanely possible \u2014 including exactly what Donald Trump is doing now,\u201d said Ms. Warren, who proposed the bureau in 2007 while a Harvard Law School professor.\u201cThe DNA of this agency is to work for America\u2019s families and to stand up to big Wall Street banks,\u201d Ms. Warren said in an interview. \u201cMick Mulvaney wants to work for Wall Street banks and step on American families.\u201dAs confusion reigned, Ms. English\u2019s tenure as a low-profile public servant abruptly ended as she fought to remain at the agency she helped lead since its opening in 2011. She headed to Capitol Hill to meet with Ms. Warren and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, among other lawmakers about her plans.The two dueling directors embody widely differing visions regarding the future of the agency. Established under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and adopting an aggressive agenda under the Obama administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau targets financial companies for practices that it considers unfair or abusive.Barney Frank, a former Democratic representative from Massachusetts who helped write the overarching law, said it intended to have the acting director fill any vacancy to protect the agency from political influence.\u201cBank regulation is a very sensitive business,\u201d Mr. Frank said Monday in an interview. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to expose the agency doing it to the normal political interference, which is what we were afraid of.\u201dThe Trump administration maintains that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which was signed into law in 1998, gives the White House authority to appoint its own replacement. On Monday, the White House doubled down.\u201cWe\u2019re aware that a lawsuit has been filed,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, \u201cbut we\u2019re also aware that the law is extremely clear and that Director Mulvaney is the acting director here.\u201dShe said the legality of his appointment was confirmed by the White House counsel\u2019s office, the Justice Department and the agency\u2019s own general counsel, who was appointed by Mr. Cordray.\u201cSo I think that everybody is in full agreement that he\u2019s the director of this office,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.But attorneys observing the case said that the legal issue of whether the Dodd-Frank Act or the Federal Vacancies Reform Act would prevail is hard to immediately untangle.Judge Kelly was formerly the chief counsel for Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Before that, he spent a decade as a federal prosecutor in Washington.Carl W. Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law who studies federal judicial selection, said Judge Kelly\u2019s tenure in Washington has probably left him familiar with \u201cinterbranch disputes.\u201d\u201cOn the president\u2019s side,\u201d Mr. Tobias said, \u201cyou can say that the Vacancies Reform Act should govern.\u201d Ms. English\u2019s camp, on the other hand, could argue that the thrust of Dodd-Frank was to create \u201ca lot of insulation\u201d for the agency to be truly politically independent, he said.Quyen Truong, a former assistant director and deputy general counsel at the bureau, predicted a likely protracted legal battle, even if Judge Kelly ultimately denied Ms. English\u2019s request to at least temporarily keep Mr. Mulvaney from running the agency.\u201cGiven the matter is being heard by a judge recently appointed by President Trump \u2014 and the standard for granting a temporary restraining order is high and difficult to meet \u2014 I think the judge will most likely deny the temporary restraining order,\u201d she said.Back at the agency, the bureaucratic Ping-Pong continued as the legal wrangling progressed. Mr. Mulvaney sent a memo to employees, asking them to \u201cplease disregard any instructions you receive from Ms. English in her presumed capacity as acting director.\u201d\u201cIf you receive additional communications from her today in any form, related in any way to the function of her actual or presumed official duties (i.e. not personal), please inform the general counsel.\u201dHe also instructed staff to say hello and grab a doughnut. On Monday, inquiries from journalists who contacted the agency\u2019s spokeswoman were referred to Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s spokesman, which suggested employees were heeding his requests.They both signed off as acting director. For the night, at least, they both were.Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting from Washington, and Tara Siegel-Bernard and Stacy Cowley from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The G.O.P.\u2019s 20th-Century Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWith this week\u2019s House floor vote and a Senate Finance Committee markup, the Republican tax plan is hurtling toward passage by year\u2019s end \u2014 a timeline that is frenzied compared to that of previous tax reform efforts, which took years and extensive debate. Many people in both parties believe the tax code needs to be modernized, especially regarding how businesses are taxed. Yet the policy choices Republicans have pursued in their grand reformation of business taxation reflect a pre-digital, pre-global economy. With their bill, they may well ensure that the United States economy is left behind once and for all.Republicans have promised simplification of the tax system. Instead, they have introduced even more complexity. This results, in part, from their choice to favor certain business activities over others, substituting congressional judgment for market pressures. And the privileged sectors are precisely those that are in decline.Take the bills\u2019 treatment of pass-through business income. In the House bill, such income is taxed at a maximum 25 percent rate, down from as high as 39.6 percent today, with a 9 percent rate for the first $75,000 of small-business income. As of Tuesday evening, the Senate plan would create a new deduction for a portion of such income, effectively capping the rate at around 32 percent. In both plans, these tax incentives are substantially smaller for businesses involving personal services \u2014 accountants, for example, or yoga instructors.In September, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin justified the exclusion of personal services from the tax cut by arguing that other industries, like manufacturing, created jobs. But manufacturing\u2019s share of the economy is only 13 percent, a share that is shrinking because of technology and outsourcing. Meanwhile, the service industry has grown significantly in the last several decades, and now employs about 10 times as many workers.What\u2019s more, under the House bill, the pass-through rate has a bias for owners of capital over laborers, a choice that is out of step in a world of rising inequality. Passive investors in active businesses would be able to obtain the low rate on all of their income from those businesses, whereas people who work for a living largely would get the low rate for only 30 percent of their business income.Even more perversely, taxpayers can raise this 30 percent threshold by making more capital investments \u2014 for example by purchasing robots and machinery to replace employees. This is apparently part of an overall scheme to punish workers: the evisceration of the estate tax, the reduction in the corporate rate and the increased tax burdens on education all allocate precious government resources to financial, rather than human, capital.Another pressing goal of tax reform is to reduce the incentives for companies to move their operations overseas. But again, the bill does the opposite.The House bill proposes an international tax system that would subject income of high-profit foreign subsidiaries to a 10 percent minimum tax. Senate Republicans have also proposed a minimum tax on foreign earnings, at a 12.5 percent rate on income from intangible assets, such as patents and copyrights.This new international tax system is a compromise between a territorial system, which would exempt foreign income altogether, and a worldwide system, which would tax all income, foreign or domestic, on basis at the same rate. This quasi-territorial approach would create a system unlike any other in the world today, applying different tax rates depending on where the income is earned.In fact, both plans largely maintain pressures for companies to locate corporate residency abroad, despite their claim to reduce taxes on corporate income. After all, a company that moves its residency to a tax haven can often achieve zero taxation, rather than being taxed at the American minimum rate, however low. Both plans have safeguards against this by increasing the tax burden on certain inbound investments, but these can be avoided by selling through independent distributors rather than related parties, among other strategies. And even then, business lobbying has already caused the House to scale back on its original proposal \u2014 a dynamic that does not bode well for the Senate\u2019s counterpart measure.Rather than revising the definition of corporate residency to account for factors such as the location of a company\u2019s headquarters or shareholders, the House and Senate plans retain the place of incorporation as the sole determinant of corporate residency, a notoriously artificial definition that has become disconnected from economic reality. They also largely subscribe to the fiction that one can identify a specific geographic locale where income is produced.Instead of modernizing the taxation of business income, Republicans have doubled down on outdated concepts like corporate residence and origin of income that have become meaningless in a global and digital economy, while also attempting to preserve dying industries. The result is a dizzyingly complex system that will interfere with market forces.Other countries have increasingly relied on consumption taxes as pro-growth alternatives to traditional business income taxes. The United States, however, remains wedded by politics and ideology to an inefficient, easily manipulated and antiquated tax policy. Rather than driving the United States to be a competitive force in the 21st century, the Republicans\u2019 plans hold the United States back in the last one.Rebecca M.

{"Headline": "House Passes Tax Bill, as Does Senate Panel", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe swift approval came two weeks after the bill was unveiled, without a single hearing on the 400-plus-page legislation and over the objections of Democrats and 13 Republicans. The focus now shifts to the Senate, where Republicans are quickly moving ahead with their own tax overhaul, which differs in substantial ways from the House bill.After four days of debate, members of the Senate Finance Committee voted 14 to 12 along party lines to approve their version of the tax package late Thursday night. The approval helps clear the way for the full Senate to consider the bill after Thanksgiving, although it remains to be seen whether it has the support to pass the chamber.\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a big step today, but of course there are many more steps ahead,\u201d Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said after the vote.Several Senate Republicans have expressed concerns about the legislative effort, and if Democrats are unified in opposition, Senate leaders can afford only two Republican defections in order to win passage through the narrowly divided chamber. In a blow to Senate Republicans, an analysis of their plan released Thursday projected the bill would actually raise taxes on low-income Americans within a few years.Representatives voted along party lines, with the exception of 13 Republicans, many of whom fought to keep the deduction for state and local taxes.Republican lawmakers must also find a way to bridge the big differences between the two bills, a hurdle given the varied priorities of lawmakers in the two houses. For instance, the Senate bill makes the individual income tax cuts temporary and delays implementation of the corporate tax cut by one year. It also includes the repeal of an Affordable Care Act provision requiring that most people have health insurance or pay a penalty.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long road ahead of us,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said after the 227-to-205 vote in the House. \u201cThis is a very, very big milestone in that long road.\u201dThe speed with which the House passed a significant rewrite of the United States tax code stunned many in Washington, who have watched previous legislative efforts by Congress succumb to gridlock.\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of shrewd legislative maneuvering and political necessity,\u201d said Ken Spain, a former official with the National Republican Congressional Committee who now lobbies on tax issues. \u201cThe result is landmark legislation moving at breakneck speed. It\u2019s a monumental accomplishment.\u201d\u201cI hope they have better luck with this issue than they had with the health care issue,\u201d Representative Mark Amodei, Republican of Nevada, said of the Senate.Democrats, who have been sidelined in both the House and Senate, continued to denounce the tax overhaul, warning that it would benefit corporations and the rich at the expense of the middle class. But Republicans are planning to pass their tax legislation using procedures that would allow it to gain approval without any Democratic votes in both chambers, leaving Democrats with little recourse aside from trying to sway public opinion.\u201cThe bill Republicans have brought to the floor today is not tax reform,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a tax cut. It is a tax scam.\u201dIt\u2019s virtually impossible to fully understand, let alone keep up with, the flood of proposals, amendments and analyses that continue to pour out. Here are some of the big-picture ideas to keep in mind as this political sausage is being made.It also roughly doubles the standard deduction that most taxpayers claim on their tax returns and increases the child tax credit to $1,600 per child from $1,000. The Senate bill, by contrast, increases the child tax credit to $2,000 per child and lowers the top marginal tax rate to 38.5 percent, from 39.6 percent. The House does not lower the top marginal tax rate for the wealthiest.The Senate plan also does not fully repeal the estate tax, while the House plan eventually scraps it entirely. The tax cuts for individuals in the Senate plan expire at the end of 2025, while those in the House plan would be permanent.House Republican leaders prevailed Thursday despite facing opposition from many of their members from New York and New Jersey, who have fought to preserve the deduction for state and local taxes, an important provision for many of their constituents given the high taxes in those states.The House bill allows the deduction of up to $10,000 in property taxes, but that provision was not enough of a concession for them.Twelve of the 13 Republicans to vote against the bill were from New York, New Jersey or California, three states with high taxes.The dozens of changes in the legislation would add more than $1.4 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years.\u201cI just have too many constituents who are going to see their taxes go up,\u201d said Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, who represents a district on Long Island. \u201cYou\u2019re taking more money from a place like New York in order to pay for deeper tax cuts elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Zeldin said.The deduction for state and local taxes stands as one of the biggest possible showdowns between the House and the Senate in the weeks to come. The Senate has proposed getting rid of the deduction entirely, a move that would almost certainly drive away additional House Republicans from high-tax states.\u201cThe intent of our tax reform bill is to achieve tax relief for individuals at every income level in every state,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still some areas where we will and can make improvements.\u201dThe Senate proposal faces an uncertain future, given the reservations of a handful of Republican senators. Republicans have a narrow 52-to-48 majority in the Senate, leaving them with little room for defections. They also have limited room to maneuver, as the tax overhaul can add no more than $1.5 trillion to federal deficits over a decade.The Times would like to hear from Americans who are signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.On Wednesday, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, became the first member of his conference to come out against the tax plan. The votes of several other Republican senators, including Susan Collins of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee, are also far from assured.A new analysis of the Senate bill by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation could further complicate the bill\u2019s trajectory. The committee said on Thursday that in 2021, the legislation would increase taxes for those earning $10,000 to $30,000. In 2027, after the individual tax cuts expire, the committee projected that those earning $75,000 or less would face higher taxes.\u201cYou\u2019ve targeted the relief to help the wealthy, and the middle-income families are going to get stuck with it,\u201d said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland.Republicans said the appearance of a tax increase for low-income people was a mirage resulting from arcane fiscal math. Because Americans would no longer be required to have health coverage, some are expected to go without it. In turn, those people would no longer receive subsidies, in the form of tax credits, for insurance that they do not purchase.Passage of the bill in the Senate is unlikely to be as drama-free as Thursday\u2019s approval in the House, given the close divide between the two parties and the outsize influence that each individual Republican senator holds as a result.Senate Democrats, like their counterparts in the House, have assailed the tax overhaul, but they now face a challenge in blunting the Republicans\u2019 momentum.\u201cWe\u2019ve all known that trying to get the word out about taxes is a bigger challenge than health care,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s like listening to somebody discuss prolonged root canal work. This is tedious stuff.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Andrew has thoughts on the detention of Prince Alwaleed of Saudi Arabia over the weekend, especially after interviewing the billionaire less than two weeks ago. And we\u2019re looking at the fallout from the Paradise Papers leaks.Two weeks ago, he seemed remarkably relaxed, no different than the few times I had interacted with him beforehand. He did make a point of praising Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his Vision 2030 plan for the country. He also was particularly spirited in his praise of President Trump, someone whom he had once called a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and had called upon to drop out of the presidential race.One thing that was surprising, given that Prince Alwaleed had been the face of finance for Saudi Arabia for years, was that he was not part of the large investment conference organized by Crown Prince Mohammed. The gathering took place at the Ritz-Carlton \u2014 just 10 minutes down the road from Alwaleed\u2019s office.\u201cThis is very risky,\u201d the business leader said, because M.B.S. is now challenging senior princes and religious conservatives simultaneously.

{"Headline": "\u2018Mad Men\u2019 Creator Matthew Weiner\u2019s Foray Into Fiction", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "ProfileAfter the popular television series ended, everyone was waiting for his next TV show. Instead, he wrote a novel.Supported byAfter he finished working on the final season of his critically acclaimed drama \u201cMad Men,\u201d Matthew Weiner found himself suddenly, alarmingly, unable to write.A few months passed. Then a year. Nothing came to him. Even his children started teasing him, badgering him about what his next project would be.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was going to do next, and I was getting asked all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI was worried I was not going to be able to write again.\u201dFinally, in the summer of 2015, Mr. Weiner called his friend, the novelist A. M. Homes, for advice. She suggested he seclude himself at Yaddo, the artists\u2019 colony in upstate New York. A few months later \u2014 \u201cwith some terror,\u201d he said \u2014 he followed her advice. While there, he began writing an unsettling psychological thriller about a wealthy New York family whose lives intersect with a sociopathic construction worker.It\u2019s unusual for a debut author to be showered in such over-the-top accolades and compared to literary masters. But then again, Mr. Weiner, 52, has hardly been laboring in obscurity. In a screenwriting career that spans more than 20 years, he\u2019s been a creative force behind some of our era\u2019s most revered cable dramas, shows that were credited with reinventing the narrative possibilities of television. He received two Emmys for \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d which he worked on as a writer and producer, and was the creator, showrunner, head writer, director and executive producer for \u201cMad Men,\u201d which aired for seven seasons and won four Golden Globes and 15 Emmys.Writing fiction has long been a goal of his, but it always felt intimidating.\u201cI was always hoping I would do it,\u201d he said during an interview this fall over lunch at the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side, not far from where the novel takes place. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know if I could.\u201dMr. Weiner\u2019s foray into fiction surprised a lot of Hollywood observers. \u201cEveryone was breaking down his door to do another show, and he goes off and does something that no one was expecting,\u201d said Semi Chellas, a writer who worked on \u201cMad Men.\u201d \u201cThe contrariness of going off and writing fiction after \u2018Mad Men\u2019 was very Matt.\u2019 \u201dFor fans of \u201cMad Men,\u201d a precisely observed, sprawling drama that chronicled the hedonistic, boozy office culture of a Madison Avenue advertising agency in the 1960s, \u201cHeather\u201d might seem like a surprising and perhaps unsatisfying creative pivot for Mr. Weiner. The story has just four central characters and can be inhaled in a single sitting. It lacks the long narrative arc and subtle character development that made \u201cMad Men\u201d an addictive and gratifying show that rewarded close watching. But in other ways, \u201cHeather\u201d feels like a stylistic and thematic sibling of \u201cMad Men,\u201d particularly in Mr. Weiner\u2019s almost surgical dissection of the ways that social status, wealth, gender and class define us.\u201cAs we know from his television work, he\u2019s a great observer of people,\u201d said Ms. Messud, author of \u201cThe Burning Girl.\u201d \u201cThis is almost like a bullet train. He\u2019s distilled the narrative down to its essence.\u201d\u201cHeather\u201d unfolds in present-day Manhattan, and like so many gripping New York stories, the plot hinges on real estate. The couple at the center of the story, Mark and Karen Breakstone, lead sheltered, privileged lives, and fawn over their perfect daughter, Heather. Mark, who works in finance, frets about his annual bonus and his status, while Karen stays home to tend to Heather, then becomes resentful when Heather grows up and no longer needs her. The Breakstones\u2019s quiet, simmering dissatisfaction is interwoven with a darker, parallel story about a man named Bobby Klasky, who grew up neglected by his a heroin-addicted mother and developed a violent streak. The two narratives collide when Bobby finds work on a construction crew that is renovating the penthouse in the Breakstones\u2019s building, and becomes obsessed with Heather.Over lunch at the Carlyle, Mr. Weiner was cheerful and animated, occasionally breaking into high pitched peals of laughter. He gushed about his favorite books and authors and seemed more eager to talk about his reading than his writing, noting that he went on a binge-reading tear after finishing \u201cMad Men,\u201d and devoured books by Haruki Murakami, Donna Tartt, Delmore Schwartz, John Steinbeck and Hermann Hesse, among others. He gossiped about famous dead novelists like they were old acquaintances. While describing his writing process and sources of inspiration, he dropped in bits of literary trivia and issued pronouncements about writers he admires.Mark Twain: \u201cHe\u2019s amazing! He dictated!\u201dTolstoy\u2019s \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d: \u201cThere\u2019s like five novels in that thing.\u201dCharles Dickens: \u201cI consider him the first TV writer.\u201dPatricia Highsmith: \u201cShe was at Yaddo! I love her work. I like the fact that it isn\u2019t judgmental and it\u2019s a little perverse.\u201dThe idea for \u201cHeather\u201d came from a scene Mr. Weiner witnessed when he was walking around the Upper East Side. in the fall of 2015. He saw an attractive teenage girl walking into an apartment building where construction work was being done, and noticed one of the workers staring at her with what looked like a mixture of lust and menace. Mr. Weiner jotted down his observations in a notebook where he collects ideas and stray bits of dialogue, and wasn\u2019t sure if anything would come of it.While he was at Yaddo, he kept thinking about the girl and the construction worker, puzzling over what he had seen, and began writing a fictionalized story about the years leading up to the encounter. He wrote 5,000 words over the next 16 days, and finished a draft in nine months.He still seems surprised that he\u2019s adding novelist to his resume. He never expected to finish the book, much less publish it.\u201cIt\u2019s like someone who goes to the casino for the first time and wins,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As a Debt Deadline Looms for Venezuela, Maduro Is Defiant", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe announcement came at the deadline for a $1.2 billion payment by the state oil company on a maturing bond, which Mr. Maduro said his government would instead deliver on Friday.Speaking on national television, Mr. Maduro said that his government was fighting \u201ca battle for the financial stability and tranquillity of Venezuela.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to win this battle,\u201d he vowed.Mr. Maduro has blamed the crisis in part on the Trump administration, which he has accused of leading an \u201ceconomic war\u201d against his country through economic sanctions intended to prevent Venezuela\u2019s government from contracting new debt.Given the sanctions, however, it remained unclear how Mr. Maduro intended to restructure the government\u2019s debt.\u201cThere\u2019s no way to restructure under existing U.S. sanctions, but the government may be hoping that bond holders now pressure the Trump administration to create an exemption to the sanctions,\u201d said Risa Grais-Targow, director for Latin America at Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis firm.There was no grace period for the loan payment due on Thursday, and it remained unclear how investors would react to the failure of the state oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, to make the payment on time.But Diego Ferro, co-chief investment officer at Greylock Capital Management, a New York hedge fund that invests in distressed high-yield bonds, said the restructuring announcement could buy Mr. Maduro some time with bondholders and the Venezuelan people.\u201cPeople were expecting the payment late anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cAs of now they have at least a few months to come up with an offer to put off litigation in the United States. It will depend on what they offer\u201d in terms of payments of principal and interest.Mr. Maduro has sought to avoid a default, which could trigger years of international legal battles among creditors for control of Pdvsa assets outside Venezuela, including its American refinery subsidiary Citgo and tankers that deliver oil around the world.\u201cVenezuela will not default strategically,\u201d said Miguel Angel Santos, a senior research fellow at the Center for International Development at Harvard. \u201cIf it defaults, it\u2019s because they have really run out of dimes and nickels.\u201dDuring a similar debt crunch in April, Rosneft provided a $1 billion advance payment for oil, which was crucial for Pdvsa to make nearly $3 billion in bond payments. Last week, senior Russian officials said they were ready to restructure some debts to suspend hundreds of millions in payments until 2020 or later.Rosneft has a 49.9 percent stake in Citgo, Pdvsa\u2019s refining and gasoline station subsidiary in the United States, as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan to the Venezuelan oil company. Rosneft and Pdvsa are in negotiations to swap Rosneft\u2019s Citgo holdings for oil fields in Venezuela out of concern that the United States government could eventually place sanctions on Citgo.International bond experts and the markets had been optimistic that the Venezuelan state oil company would make the $1.2 billion payment on time on Thursday.But in recent years, Pdvsa has increasingly left investors and the market guessing up to the last minute on whether it would make its debt payments.With the company facing a deadline last week on a separate bond payment, the markets were particularly jittery amid conflicting signals from the government about its preparedness to pay. On Friday, the company announced it had started to make the payment before the deadline, though bondholders did not start seeing the payments until a few days later.The Venezuelan government and Pdvsa have been skipping interest payments over the last four weeks, taking advantage of grace periods to delay more than $700 million in payouts.\u201cThey\u2019re living day by day essentially,\u201d said Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, an adjunct lecturer of finance at the Kellogg School of Management. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that at the liquidity level, there\u2019s a scramble, there\u2019s always a scramble.\u201dWith more debt payments due in the coming months, the government and Pdvsa are offering leasing deals to Russian and Chinese companies to transfer operational control of one or two major refineries, according to Argus, an energy and commodity news service.But energy experts say that Venezuela\u2019s refineries would be risky investments for any foreign oil company given that they are in poor working condition and that the domestic gasoline and diesel market is highly subsidized so returns are low.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Venezuela\u2019s vice president.

{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio\u2019s Mandate: Creating the \u2018Fairest Big City in America\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA mandate.Mr. de Blasio repeated the word several times during a 36-minute news conference, brandishing it as a kind of rhetorical cudgel to beat back critics of his progressive agenda and potential opponents to it in the state Capitol.He used the opportunity to reiterate the themes of his campaign, newly ratified by voters, and for the first time declare that his energy in the second term would be principally focused on issues of education. He said his next four years would be dedicated to creating greater \u201cfairness,\u201d a focus that has long shaped his view of policy.\u201cYesterday, the people of New York City delivered a message loud and clear and delivered a mandate, a mandate for fairness, to make this the fairest big city in America,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at the start.Mr. de Blasio got 66 percent of the vote on Tuesday, far more than his Republican opponent, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who received about 28 percent. Turnout was low, similar to the election four years ago that swept Mr. de Blasio to City Hall.The mayor said that opposition in New York to President Trump energized voters in the city and helped propel his victory. \u201cI say with humility, I have been a leading anti-Trump voice,\u201d he said.Shortly after the news conference, three of his deputy mayors briefed reporters on the effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax proposal on New York City taxpayers and on the city\u2019s ability to create affordable housing.In his remarks, Mr. de Blasio provided few details on his plans for his second term, saying he would do so \u201cin the days to come,\u201d though he gave some hints.\u201cWe need the school system to look entirely different in the coming years,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, citing proposals to expand free education to reach all 3-year-olds and to have all students reading at grade level by third grade. \u201cThat is the mission I will be most focused on, that will be the issue I put my greatest passion and energy into.\u201dThe news conference played out in much the way that similar events had during his first term. It started late: Mr. de Blasio arrived at City Hall after noon, after a visit to his gym, in Brooklyn. He took 23 minutes of questions, and left while reporters\u2019 hands were still in the air.Mr. de Blasio pre-empted the inevitable questions about potential turnover in top city officials that come with a second term by saying at the outset that he would not discuss the topic.The three deputy mayors, asked at the later briefing, similarly refused to answer, though the first deputy mayor, Anthony Shorris, joked that he planned on spending \u201cthe rest of my life here.\u201dAsked if he would create a political action committee or some other vehicle to finance his own political activity outside New York City, Mr. de Blasio said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any plans at this point.\u201d Pressed further, he added: \u201cI have no plans. That\u2019s all I want to say.\u201dMr. de Blasio\u2019s declaration of an electoral mandate is not unusual for political leaders. Julia Azari, a political science professor at Marquette University who has studied presidential mandate claims, said mandates are often claimed when \u201caddressing critics or speaking to critics\u201d and frequently in the context of news conferences.The margin of victory or the quality of the opponent do not generally enter into the equation of what makes a mandate, she said. The only important factor is that it was an election victory.\u201cWhat happened in the election is sort of beside the point in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat tends to matter are what kinds of political problems does the president\u201d \u2014 or in this case, the mayor \u2014 \u201chave to solve.\u201dFor Mr. de Blasio, the most pressing problems are outside his direct control, including moving several major initiatives through Albany: a new tax on homes sold for more than $2 million to pay for housing for seniors; a new tax on residents earning more than $500,000 to pay for transit; new voting rules; and more control for the city over rent-regulated apartments.Having pledged to make New York \u201cthe fairest city in America,\u201d Mr. de Blasio was asked what city he considered to be the fairest in the land.\u201cI did not go about the question that way,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t take a survey of big cities and ask, \u2018What\u2019s your fairness quotient.\u2019 \u201dBut he appeared to acknowledge that fairness was a fuzzier concept than calling New York the \u201csafest big city\u201d in America, which is a claim that can be measured through crime statistics.\u201cI\u2019m setting a goal for us to reach the heights we can reach,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Detroit: From Motor City to Housing Incubator", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "The 2008 financial crisis and 2013 city bankruptcy gutted Detroit\u2019s housing market. Now, Detroit is experimenting with unorthodox ways to get people to buy homes and renovate houses.Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, the country\u2019s two largest banks, trace their roots in Detroit back decades, when they helped finance the city\u2019s once-booming auto industry.These days, Detroit is still struggling to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, and the two banks have pledged to help resuscitate the city and its crippled housing market. So, guess how many home mortgage loans these two enormous banks made last year in this city of 637,000 people.Bank of America made 18. JPMorgan did just six.Detroit\u2019s hometown lender, Quicken Loans, made the most \u2014 170 mortgages.Midwestern cities like Detroit have long embodied the American can-do spirit. Over the course of a century, Motor City melded assembly-line prowess with freedom-of-the-road ideals to help define a nation. In the postwar years, Detroit became the epitome of the American dream, a place where factory workers without college degrees could make enough money to buy a house of their own.Yet as home prices soar across the United States \u2014 particularly on the coasts \u2014 Detroit remains a poster child for the economic crisis and housing collapse of a decade ago. Boarded up homes and rubble-strewn fields litter the landscape.Today, a house can be bought here for the price of a used Chevy Caprice.What is truly surprising about that, though, is how difficult it still is for buyers to actually buy. Basically, prices are too low for lenders (who see the deals as too small or risky) but too high for buyers (who may be cash-poor). There aren\u2019t enough houses in move-in-ready condition \u2014 and not enough money to fix them up.This strange situation has turned Detroit into an unlikely petri dish for experiments into how to kick-start a housing market that is, depending on your perspective, either slumbering or comatose.Will a neighborhood of \u201ctiny houses\u201d for the poor help fix things? Or how about rehabbing city-owned homes, and selling them at a loss, to jump-start the action? Other more conventional \u2014 if risky \u2014 ideas involve providing no-interest financing to fix up tumbledown properties. Or offering mortgages for homes that normally would be too small to be worth a banker\u2019s trouble.One local financier is even trying to beautify bulldozed neighborhoods by planting thousands of trees on 160 acres of vacant land his firm has gobbled up.And while Detroit is worse off than most big cities, housing-policy makers nationwide are keeping a close eye to see what lessons can be learned.To understand how far Detroit has fallen, consider the statistics. In the mid-2000s, banks were writing some 7,000 mortgages a year. Then, the financial crisis nearly destroyed the American automotive industry, Detroit\u2019s economic heart. Jobs disappeared; citizens fled. Last year, there were more than 700 mortgages made in Detroit, up from 200 at the depth of the crisis but barely 10 percent of the level a decade earlier.Those bleak numbers, however, do not tell the whole story. Behind the scenes, nonprofit groups, foundations, local officials and a dozen banks including JPMorgan, Bank of America and Quicken are trying to varying degrees to reanimate the mortgage market in Michigan\u2019s largest city.Success, however, often comes achingly slow.At 15455 Winthrop Street, on one of Detroit\u2019s better manicured blocks, there is a freshly rehabbed three-bedroom home. The bungalow-style house was fixed up by the city itself, through its land bank, which acquired the house a year ago after the county foreclosed on the owner for failing to pay taxes. The land bank did a gut renovation with money provided by a grant from Quicken.Since August, the land bank has been trying to sell the house, with a price tag of at least $79,900. More than 80 people have come to check it out. But so far there have been no takers.\u201cWe have never not sold one,\u201d said Craig Fahle, a former radio host who today is the communications director for the Detroit Land Bank Authority. \u201cDetroit likes to do everything kicking and screaming,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we get there eventually.\u201dEven happy stories are the product of a slog. Erica Wyatt struggled to pay down her debts and then searched for two years before she managed to get a mortgage from Fifth Third Bank to buy a four-bedroom home for $92,000. The transaction happened only because Ms. Wyatt, a single mother with four children, received $15,000 in down payment assistance.Ms. Wyatt, who grew up in Detroit, said she was determined to move back into the city after renting a home in a suburb. \u201cI wanted to make sure my children saw that not all of Detroit is bad and there are some beautiful neighborhoods,\u201d said Ms. Wyatt, 39, who works for an insurance company.The dollhouse-like structures \u2014 seven so far \u2014 are near the organization\u2019s main social services facility, in a rather desolate area of Detroit off Rosa Parks Boulevard. In all, Ms. Fowler hopes to build two dozen small homes, which will be rented for as little as $250 a month and eventually deeded over after seven years to a select group of homeless or poor individuals.Tiny-house living can take adjustment, even for people with no roof over their heads at all. Ms. Fowler said that one homeless veteran told her the homes were too small to compete with a traditional homeless shelter.Still, for some, the homes are perfect. One of the first tenants to move in this past summer is a former Methodist minister, David Leenhouts, who was forced to give up his ministry near Cleveland because of health issues that make it difficult for him to walk and talk.Mr. Leenhouts, who grew up in the Detroit area, said his college-age son told him the small home, with a steepled ceiling, was all he needed because everything is within just a few steps. Mr. Leenhouts, 59, said, \u201cI have no idea where I would be living if I was not chosen for a tiny house.\u201dThat said, a cluster of tiny homes hardly seems scalable in a city as big as Detroit. And almost by definition, a tiny home isn\u2019t a viable option for a family with children.It\u2019s also an example of why the long-term prognosis for Detroit\u2019s housing market remains uncertain at best. Much of the work underway is taking place block-by-block \u2014 much like the tiny-home homeless experiment \u2014 and there are a lot of blocks in this 139-square-mile city.\u201cThe pilot programs help some people, but they are on the margin,\u201d said Gregory Markus, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Michigan and executive director of Detroit Action Commonwealth, an advocacy group for low-income residents. \u201c\u2018The root problem is that Detroit is the poorest big city in America.\u201d\u2019The national poverty rate is 14 percent, and Detroit\u2019s is 36 percent. Mr. Markus said that, without more jobs, home buying will remain a largely unattainable goal.Detroit\u2019s population peaked in the 1950s at nearly 2 million and has been falling ever since. The financial crisis and the city\u2019s bankruptcy filing in 2013 hollowed out what was left of its once large, middle-class African-American community. Over the past decade there have been more than 150,000 home foreclosures here.Things are so difficult that simply finding a contractor to rehab a home can be an ordeal. \u201cWe had several contractors who didn\u2019t want to do work in the city,\u201d said Heather McKeon, 35, who along with her husband, Matthew, recently moved into a fixer-upper in Detroit\u2019s up-and-coming Corktown neighborhood. \u201cThey would say, \u2018I don\u2019t trust that I can keep my tools here.\u2019\u201dShe added: \u201cIt is still sort of flabbergasting to be laughed at.\u201dMs. McKeon, an interior designer, said many insurers wouldn\u2019t sell them a homeowner\u2019s policy on an unoccupied home under renovation. Ultimately, they got a policy from a subsidiary of Munich Re Group of Germany.Many of the efforts to resuscitate the housing market begin with the Detroit Land Bank Authority, a government agency that is the city\u2019s single largest property owner. The land bank owns some 25,000 vacant homes in various stages of disrepair, another 4,200 occupied homes and 65,000 grass-covered lots where homes once stood before the city tore them down in an effort to fight blight.Mr. Fahle, the land bank\u2019s communications director, likes to drive around and point out once-abandoned houses that his employer sold to people who then fixed them up.But on a rainy September day, he was particularly interested in showing off the refurbished three-bedroom house at 15455 Winthrop, which the land bank spent $98,000 to renovate. The asking price for the home \u2014 with its restored hardwood floors and a new granite kitchen countertop \u2014 was reduced by a few thousand dollars in early September from $83,000 to spur more interest.The program, though, is losing money \u2014 an average of $21,000 for every home sold.Mr. Fahle said the goal wasn\u2019t to turn a profit, but to get more move-in-ready homes into the marketplace and to boost property values in the process. In all, the land bank has sold more than 2,700 houses, many in online auctions.The land bank\u2019s operations are not without controversy. Housing advocates have complained it has focused too much attention on rehabbing homes in just a few neighborhoods, and on tearing down dilapidated homes elsewhere. A federal grand jury has been investigating the awarding of contracts to tear down more than 12,000 dilapidated homes as part of a war on blight led by Detroit\u2019s first-term mayor, Mike Duggan. The investigation is looking into why costs soared under the demolition program, with almost $140 million in mostly federal money being spent.Mr. Fahle said the land bank is cooperating with the investigation. He said criticism that the rehabbed and ready program has focused on a just a small part of the city is misguided. Mr. Fahle said a decision was made to select homes for renovation in four neighborhoods early on, but over time it is expanding to other parts of the city.Homes are certainly worth more in Detroit now than they were a few years ago. Citywide, the median value for a house here is $47,700, a 40 percent gain over the past two years, according to Zillow. Stately homes in the Villages, a group of neighborhoods with tree-lined streets, located not far from the posh suburb of Grosse Pointe, Mich., have sold for more than $400,000.But progress is largely limited to a small cluster of neighborhoods. About half of the mortgages written in Detroit last year were for homes purchased in just six ZIP codes, according to data from the real estate information firm RealtyTrac, part of Attom Data Solutions. There are 25 ZIP codes in Detroit.One question is whether the money that banks are providing \u2014 a combination of grants and loans \u2014 signifies a long-term commitment or an effort to score points with federal regulators. Banks are expected under the federal Community Reinvestment Act to make loans in communities with large numbers of poor- or moderate-income residents in order to spur economic activity.The downpayment-assistance program that helped Ms. Wyatt buy her home, for instance, was financed by a settlement Wells Fargo reached a few years ago in a housing class-action lawsuit. The settlement money is drying up, though, and the bank said it was not sure if it will renew the program. So far, it has provided assistance to 180 home buyers in the city.Bank of America said it was committed to working in Detroit and is providing up to $4 million to fund no-interest loans that have enabled 400 homeowners to fix up properties. The bank, working with two nonprofit groups, also has said it was willing to finance $55 million worth of mortgages in Detroit. So far this year, the bank has issued 23 mortgages in Detroit \u2014 up from 18 in 2016 \u2014 and has increased the number of loan officers in the city.JPMorgan said it, too, was here for the long haul. Jamie Dimon, the bank\u2019s chairman and chief executive, regularly promotes its Invested in Detroit program, which includes up to $150 million for housing and commercial development and funds for research by the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., to study ways to revive Detroit\u2019s economy and housing market.Quicken, which moved most of its operations in 2010 to downtown Detroit from nearby Livonia, Mich., recently committed $300,000 to a new government program that will give 80 tenants living in homes that face tax foreclosure a chance to buy the houses for as little as $2,500.The mayoral election on Nov. 7 is to some degree a referendum on Mr. Duggan\u2019s efforts at reviving both downtown and the city\u2019s housing market. Mr. Duggan is seeking a second term and is opposed by Senator Coleman Young II. Mr. Duggan said one of his top priorities as mayor was getting home prices up in Detroit.\u201cHome-sale prices have climbed far faster than anyone could have predicted,\u201d Mr. Duggan said.Perhaps the most vexing issue is the reluctance of banks to give loans to people to buy cheap homes. It\u2019s simple business: The costs of underwriting a $50,000 mortgage \u2014 doing all the paperwork, the credit checks and the inspections \u2014 are the same as for much larger mortgages that can generate more bank revenue. Plus, when homes are in such disrepair, often they are appraised for much less than the amount the borrower needs to fix it up.That means the collateral on the loan \u2014 the house itself \u2014 is worth less than the amount the bank is owed. In today\u2019s risk-averse banking culture, that\u2019s a big no-no.\u201cDHM wants to be an ambassador for lending in the city,\u201d said Alex DeCamp, the mortgage community development manager for Chemical Bank, a local lender that has funded 15 loans through the program. The program can take months to complete. Applicants go through a careful screening and most also complete three mortgage workshops to be eligible for a loan.So far, 54 home buyers have bought homes through the program, among them Ms. McKeon and her husband. So did Ashley and Damon Dickerson, who are about to move into a renovated two-family home.The Dickersons, both of whom are architectural designers, closed in March. But their search began months earlier when they submitted a $45,000 bid during one of the land bank\u2019s daily online property auctions.Winning the bidding for the 107-year-old home was just the start. The couple found it would cost at least $180,000 to fully renovate the six-bedroom, three-story brick structure with a large porch. They were attracted to the home\u2019s hardwood floors, bay windows and potential to reshape it by knocking down some walls.The Detroit Home Mortgage project is now looking to get banks to provide low-interest loans directly to local contractors, so they can renovate more homes and get them into move-in-ready condition.But for now, the lack of move-in ready homes means home buyers like the Dickersons and the McKeons need to be something of urban pioneers \u2014 fixing everything from broken water lines to antiquated electrical wiring.The prospect of people moving into Detroit from the suburbs or city residents getting mortgages is of course sweet music to local real estate agents. Until now, much of the business for them has been handling all-cash deals. But several said they are looking forward to getting local residents into homes with traditional financing.Dorian Harvey, a Detroit native and the incoming president of the Detroit Association of Realtors, said he would like for the city and land bank to move quicker to get vacant homes into the hands of local residents. Mr. Harvey, a Morehouse College graduate, said he came from the camp that the rebirth of Detroit is going to have to happen from the ground up with everyone taking part \u2014 contractors, real estate agents and local investors.But he isn\u2019t necessarily waiting on government largess. \u201cThere are untapped resources in the city and we need to tap them and the city needs to tap them,\u201d said Mr. Harvey, who added there\u2019s money to made in Detroit. \u201cMy heart is liberal but my money is conservative.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of mortgages written for housing purchases in Detroit last year by Quicken Loans. It was 170, not 90.Follow me on twitter @mattgoldstein26Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Feuds With Democrats Ahead of a Possible Government Shutdown", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Democratic leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, responded to the president\u2019s provocations by pulling out of a scheduled White House meeting meant to address the thorny issues that lawmakers are facing as the end of the year approaches.Mr. Trump then doubled down, posing for television cameras at the White House next to empty chairs and calling his would-be negotiating partners weak on crime, weak on immigration and weak on the military.\u201cThey\u2019ve been all talk, and they\u2019ve been no action, and now it\u2019s even worse,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNow it\u2019s not even talk.\u201dThe spectacle was an unpromising start to the difficult negotiations ahead, with a deadline of Dec. 8, when government funding runs out. Democrats hold significant leverage because Republicans do not have enough votes to pass a spending measure next week without some Democratic support.Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer hope to use the negotiations to help undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children and to provide financing for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, whose funding lapsed at the end of September.And on Capitol Hill, some progress was made on Tuesday during talks on the Republican tax bill. Mr. Trump voiced support for legislation to fund subsidies to health insurers that he had cut off, as well as another bipartisan health care measure that could lower insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act.But the war of words in public did little to secure the Democratic support that Mr. Trump and Republican leaders will ultimately need. The president seemed to see little risk in a holiday government shutdown.\u201cIf that happens, I would absolutely blame the Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it happens, it\u2019s going to be over illegals pouring into the country, crime pouring into the country, no border wall \u2014 which everybody wants.\u201d\u201cHis empty chair photo opp showed he\u2019s more interested in stunts than in addressing the needs of the American people,\u201d she continued. \u201cPoor Ryan and McConnell relegated to props. Sad!\u201dExasperated aides to the president assured congressional advisers that the president had simply been trying to stoke drama, and that he did not intend to suggest that no deal could be reached. But the president has toggled back and forth between sounding open to the Democrats\u2019 demands on immigration and insisting on an immigration hard line and the need for a border wall.Mr. Trump does not want to be blamed for mass deportations of people who were brought to the country through no choice of their own, a presidential adviser has said. But he also has used recent events, particularly the special election for Senate in Alabama, as a bellwether for the mood of his most ardent voters.But other Republicans see a severe risk in a government shutdown when they control both chambers of Congress and the White House.\u201cI think we should avoid a shutdown at all cost,\u201d said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \u201cIf the Democrats want a shutdown, they\u2019re making a mistake. The Republicans want a shutdown \u2014 we know that\u2019s a mistake.\u201d\u201cNobody wins that way,\u201d he added.G. William Hoagland, a former Republican staff director for the Senate Budget Committee, warned, \u201cWhen Republicans control the House and Senate and the White House, a government shutdown under their watch just looks like they can absolutely do nothing.\u201d\u201cProblem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t see a deal!\u201dTwo hours later, Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi struck back.\u201cGiven that the president doesn\u2019t see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead,\u201d they said in a statement announcing that they would skip the meeting.The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the president wanted the Democratic leaders to \u201cput aside their pettiness, stop the political grandstanding, show up and get to work.\u201dThe list of issues is longer than immigration, the border wall and health care. Lawmakers would like to pass a spending measure to fund the government through the rest of the 2018 fiscal year, which goes through Sept. 30. But to do so, party leaders need to come to a deal to lift strict caps on spending that were imposed in 2011.Defense hawks like Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, want a big boost in military spending. Democrats insist that nondefense spending should increase by just as much.With time running short, lawmakers may be forced to pass a stopgap spending measure to keep the government open past next week, just as they did in September when the last shutdown deadline approached, but that too would need Democratic votes.\u201cWhat we do now is return to our Republican colleagues and say, \u2018Is this the direction you want to take our government at the end of the year?\u2019\u201d said Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, a member of the Democratic leadership. \u201cNot only put at jeopardy thousands of individuals who are on DACA, but the entire government work force right before the Christmas and Hanukkah holiday, before the New Year?\u201dAnother issue is the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which has had broad bipartisan support since it was created in 1997. Funds expired at the end of September, and Republicans and Democrats have fought over how to pay for an extension. Unless Congress provides more money, states will have to freeze enrollment or start shutting down the program, which serves more than eight million children.Yamiche Alcindor and Robert Pear contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Real Estate Agents Mobilize to Shield Homeowners on Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, the real estate industry has benefited from generous tax deductions that raise home values by making it cheaper for people to own property and shoulder their local taxes. Now, as the Republican tax plan makes its way through Congress, the industry is worried that the fallout will harm its business by making homeownership less valuable.Last week, Ms. Jay and other agents congregated in front of the local office of Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, holding signs and chanting, \u201cSave homeownership.\u201d\u201cWe know he has a tough job to do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we certainly are not going to shy away from letting him know what our feelings are.\u201dAccording to some economists, real estate agents have plenty to fear. The Senate version of the tax bill would eliminate the deduction for local property taxes (the House bill caps it at $10,000), and both the House and Senate bills would effectively make the mortgage-interest deduction less valuable to many homeowners. Both provisions could raise the cost of owning a home, making homeownership less attractive for at least some families \u2014 and perhaps depressing property values.Like just about every aspect of the tax plan, these measures would fall hardest on people who lived in high-cost, high-tax areas. According to an analysis of the plans by Moody\u2019s Analytics, the nation\u2019s most expensive real estate markets could see significant declines in home values under both versions of the tax plan.\u201cThere really are big winners and losers here,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cIf you live in New York or New Jersey, you\u2019re going to get crushed. If you\u2019re in West Texas or Nebraska, no big deal, and you may even benefit.\u201dIn New York and New Jersey, which have expensive homes and high property taxes, home values could fall as much as 14 percent by 2019 under the Senate plan, according to the Moody\u2019s analysis. The suburbs around Chicago, Cleveland and Philadelphia are also near the top of the list.Those figures are estimates, so should be viewed with some degree of skepticism. Still, they reflect a fundamental truth: The tax code subsidizes homeownership, and that has raised the value of homes. All else being equal, removing those tax breaks should reduce home prices.Some economists are skeptical that the tax bills would have a major impact on the housing market. Matthew Pointon, a housing economist at Capital Economics in New York, said the bills could lead some well-to-do families to buy somewhat smaller homes than they otherwise would. But he noted that most households already chose not to itemize their deductions, and so didn\u2019t benefit directly from the housing-oriented tax breaks that the bill would eliminate.And to the extent that the bills would cut taxes for most families, Mr. Pointon said, that could stimulate the housing market by giving prospective home buyers more money to spend.Vishwanath Tirupattur, United States housing strategist for Morgan Stanley, said the bills would most likely have a modest negative impact on both home prices and sales activity. He said other forces, including rising demand for housing among millennials and a limited supply of single-family homes, should help counterbalance the effects of the bills.Neither the House nor the Senate tax bill would repeal the tax code\u2019s biggest gift to homeowners, the deductibility of interest for most mortgages. But they would make that deduction less valuable.Both bills would roughly double the standard deduction, which would lead fewer households to itemize their deductions; households that take the standard deduction don\u2019t directly benefit from the mortgage-interest deduction, which reduces the value of owning a home. The House bill would also cap the amount of mortgage debt eligible for the deduction at $500,000; the Senate bill would leave the cap at its present level of $1 million.The tax plans could also hurt the housing market in a less direct way. Most independent analyses estimate the bills could add $1 trillion or more to the federal deficit at a time when unemployment is low and the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates. With more demand in the debt market, standard economic theory suggests that mortgage rates would increase faster than they would have absent a higher deficit, raising the cost of financing a home.Economists, including Mr. Zandi, have never been particularly fond of the various tax subsidies for homeownership. They favor homeowners over renters and distort the housing market and even migration patterns by encouraging people to buy bigger homes in higher-tax suburbs.But now that those tax breaks are baked into the system, homeowners have come to count on them and in some cases could end up \u201cunderwater\u201d \u2014 that is, their home would be worth less than their mortgage \u2014 if their deductions were abruptly ripped away. Mr. Zandi said he favored some kind of phase-in period so that markets could adjust more gradually.\u201cIn some of these communities, it could be really damaging to the economy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Voters Could Sway an Alabama Senate Race Rocked by Scandal", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySELMA, Ala. \u2014 The volatile Alabama Senate race has generated national headlines with the allegations of sexual misconduct by the Republican candidate Roy S. Moore \u2014 and the question of whether Mr. Moore\u2019s white evangelical base will stick by him.But the outcome could also hinge on another key voting bloc: African-Americans, whose participation in the Dec. 12 election will be crucial if the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, is to have a chance.Democrats have not won a statewide race here since 2008, and some worry that black voters, who make up more than half of the Democratic electorate, are not sufficiently engaged two weeks before the election. Glen Browder, an emeritus professor of political science at Jacksonville State University who served as a Democratic congressman from Alabama from 1989 to 1996, said that Mr. Moore\u2019s core supporters see the race in \u201cmoral and ideological\u201d terms and would be highly motivated to go to the polls. But many black voters, he said, were not equally invested in the race. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s less likely that they will turn out,\u201d he said.Mr. Jones\u2019s potential \u2014 and his potential problems \u2014 are evident in Selma, famous for its role in the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, and set in the poor, agricultural, and heavily African-American swath of the state known as the Black Belt. The region is a prime target for Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts.Synethia Pettaway, the chairwoman of the Dallas County Democratic Party, said the allegations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Moore had heightened awareness of the race among her fellow black voters, particularly women.\u201cWhat I\u2019m finding is that the women are not taking it lightly,\u201d Ms. Pettaway said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m finding there are more women who have been sexually harassed or molested than people realize.\u201dBut in interviews last Tuesday with 10 African-Americans at a strip mall near the Walmart, six of them said they were not aware that a Senate race was underway.Those who had heard about the race said they were disposed to vote against Mr. Moore, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. Tabatha Jones, 39, a caregiver, said that she was mostly sick of the incessant turmoil Mr. Moore had stirred up over the years \u2014 not only over the recent allegations, which troubled her, but also the two times Mr. Moore was effectively removed from the state\u2019s high court after he refused to take down a Ten Commandments statue and disagreed with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing same-sex marriage.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much Democrat or Republican,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s just all of the drama. Enough of the negativity.\u201dOthers were less plugged in.At a nearby Subway sandwich shop, Civeta Boyd, a 24-year-old hairstylist, said she might have heard Mr. Moore\u2019s name on the news. But she was not sure. There has, of late, been a blizzard of stories about American men acting badly.\u201cRoy Moore?\u201d Ms. Boyd said, between bites of a salad. \u201cHe was a news anchor, something like that?\u201dThat lack of recognition could change. Mr. Jones has an enormous fund-raising advantage and has blanketed the airwaves with TV ads, including during last week\u2019s widely watched Iron Bowl football game between Auburn and Alabama.Moreover, Mr. Jones, who is white, is still not well known among many black voters, despite a sterling civil rights credential: In 2001 and 2002, while working as a United States attorney, he successfully prosecuted two white Klansmen for their roles in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham that killed four African-American girls.Ms. Pettaway conceded that it was still necessary to teach many voters about Mr. Jones\u2019s role in the bombing case. \u201cI\u2019m finding that a lot of people are not educated about that,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThe closer we get to the Election Day the more we will talk about that.\u201dAlthough whites make up about 71 percent of the Alabama electorate, black voters can exert substantial influence, depending on their turnout. The secretary of state\u2019s office says that there are about 765,000 active black voters on the rolls and that only about one million voters are expected to go to the polls for the Senate race.\u201cDoug has said from Day 1 that there is not a different message in different communities,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cAnd what we\u2019re seeing is folks are responding to our message.\u201dA message more customized to black voters is being spread by a group called Vote or Die, led by Faya Ora Rose Toure, a longtime Selma activist. The statewide get-out-the-vote effort has been handing out cards declaring that failing to vote on Dec. 12 would, among other things, obliterate housing and food programs, voting rights, \u201cJustice & Civil Rights,\u201d and \u201cEfforts to Stop Police Brutality on unarmed Black & Brown men.\u201dOver the years, Mr. Moore has gained a following among some black Alabama residents with his focus on conservative values and the primacy of biblical law. James McCaney, the senior pastor at Victory Christian Fellowship Church in Florence, said that allegations not proven in a court of law were not enough to move him from his support for Mr. Moore.\u201cWe have proof that he\u2019s a Christian,\u201d Mr. McCaney said. \u201cNobody has said he\u2019s lived anything other than that for 35 to 40 years at least. With that kind of track record, we just don\u2019t flip that away because of some allegations.\u201dMr. Moore has denied any wrongdoing. His campaign did not respond to requests to discuss its strategy for reaching out to black voters.Mr. Perry said the Jones campaign is hoping to make contact with \u201cevery single likely African-American voter\u201d five or six times before the election, by mail, phone or otherwise. But he also said he has \u201cgotten absolutely no help from the state Democratic Party,\u201d saying that it had failed to finance the campaign and refused to share its executive committee\u2019s contact information.Nancy Worley, the state party chairwoman, said that the party had assigned money for national Democratic groups to use in the campaign and that she and Mr. Perry had a \u201clong history\u201d of bad blood.The focus on the sexual allegations against Mr. Moore has been frustrating to Catherine Flowers, an activist who said they were blotting out other issues important to African-Americans.Alan Blinder contributed reporting from Birmingham, Ala., and Alexander Burns from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the Singapore Model Save Zimbabwe?", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEmmerson Mnangagwa, the new president of Zimbabwe, will have a hard time digging his country out of the economic hole that it fell into during the 37 years it was led by Robert Mugabe. But it can be done.During Mr. Mugabe\u2019s reign, all economic activity was dependent on political decisions, which enhanced the prizes of political power and the stakes in the fight for it. State-owned enterprises, capital controls, price controls, import controls, one-time mining fees and a plethora of regulations wrapped Zimbabwe in a giant ball of red tape and destroyed the economy.Zimbabwe\u2019s economic decline has been punctuated by several notable events and episodes. One of these was the Fast-Track Land Reform Program of 2000, under which land was seized from white farmers.This confiscation had been happening since 1980, but under this program, the farms were taken without compensation. Zimbabwe\u2019s Supreme Court declared the program unconstitutional, but Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government ignored that ruling.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government then instituted a system in which the United States dollar became the coin of the realm. Government accounts became denominated in United States dollars in 2009. As a result of this dollarization and the installation of a national unity government in 2009, the economy rebounded.The end of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s rule raises the question: What is next for the economy? Zimbabwe could adopt the strategy of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u2019s first prime minister. That strategy was based on four principles: stable money, no foreign aid, first-world competitiveness and the protection of private property and the public\u2019s safety. With Mr. Lee\u2019s near perfect execution of the strategy, Singapore escaped its grinding poverty of 1965 to become one of the world\u2019s most affluent countries.Mr.Mnangagwa does not remind one of Mr. Lee. Indeed, he was a pillar of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s regime. Unlike the impoverished populace, Mr. Mnangagwa and his supporters in the military and party have done well under Mr. Mugabe\u2019s system of spoils.But the people are fed up with their poverty. Mr. Mnangagwa claims to be listening, even declaring that the \u201cvoice of the people is the voice of God.\u201dTo deliver, Mr. Mnangagwa must prohibit the issuance of New Zim dollars. The dollarization rules followed by the unity government should be restored. Mr. Mnangagwa should also announce that private enterprise is Zimbabwe\u2019s future.The World Bank has found that there is a strong positive relationship between a country\u2019s prosperity and how easy it is to do business there. At present, Zimbabwe ranks 159 out of 190 on the bank\u2019s ease of doing business metric, with a score of 48.47. If the country loosened the government\u2019s grip on the economy and reached the same score as neighboring Botswana (64.94), it would boom, as it did during the unity government years.Steve H. Hanke is a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warning Signs About Another Giant Bitcoin Exchange", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the price of Bitcoin has soared, the virtual currency has edged toward the mainstream.Square, the fast-growing payments company run by the Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, has begun selling Bitcoins to ordinary consumers, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will soon allow banks to trade on the value of Bitcoin.But if you want to see where the price of Bitcoin is actually determined in round-the-clock bidding, you have to go to a number of unregulated exchanges that often fly in the face of American and European laws.These days, no exchange is bigger than Bitfinex, an opaque operation that provides no information on its website about where it is or who operates the company.Bitfinex, which is officially incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, has been fined by regulators in the United States and cut off by American banks, and it has lost millions of dollars of customer money in two separate hackings, leading critics to question whether it even has the money it claims to hold.In the latest blow, on Tuesday, an alternative virtual currency that is owned and operated by the same people as Bitfinex, known as Tether, announced that it had been hacked and lost around $30 million worth of digital tokens.None of that has been enough to stop customers from pumping billions of dollars worth of virtual currency trades through Bitfinex in recent weeks \u2014 on some days, the exchange claimed to be doing more trades, by dollar value, than some stock exchanges in the United States.Even many people who believe in virtual currencies worry that the mixture of loose controls and booming trading at the world\u2019s largest exchange is likely to cause trouble for all the investors piling into virtual currencies, even those who don\u2019t go near Bitfinex.The chief executive of Bitfinex and Tether, Jan Ludovicus van der Velde, said in an email on Tuesday that \u201cthe financial position of the company has never been stronger.\u201dConcerns over virtual currency exchanges are nothing new. The first and largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, collapsed in 2014 after losing $500 million of customer money to hackers.This year, law enforcement took down another large Bitcoin exchange, BTC-E, which was accused of being a way station for many of the Bitcoin flowing through online black markets and ransomware attacks.Regulators in the United States and a few other countries have tried to tame the business, and the largest exchanges in the United States and Japan are now under official oversight.Those regulated exchanges, though, are dwarfed by unregulated ones like Bitfinex and several that have popped up in South Korea, where regulators have been slow to act.The liquid nature of the Bitcoin markets, flowing around national borders and laws, is a product of the virtual currency\u2019s unusual structure. Bitcoin is stored and moved through a decentralized network of computers that are not under the control of any single company or government.This structure means that the virtual currency continues to be an easy target for people who want to manipulate its price or use it to launder money.\u201cUnregulated, unregistered exchanges are a very big concern for the industry and the community broadly,\u201d said Kathryn Haun, a former federal prosecutor who is on the board of the American virtual currency company Coinbase.Mr. Potter, 45, runs Bitfinex alongside Mr. Van der Velde, a Dutch-speaking man living in Hong Kong, and Giancarlo Devasini, an Italian man who lives on the French Riviera, according to company filings in Hong Kong.The company lost 1,500 Bitcoin, worth around $400,000, to a hacker in 2015. But the most damaging incident happened in August 2016 when a thief got almost 120,000 Bitcoin, worth around $75 million at the time.The company spread out the losses to all customers \u2014 even those who were not holding Bitcoin at the time of the hacking \u2014 by forcing customers to take a 36 percent haircut or loss on any money at the exchange.The lack of detail that Bitfinex provided about the hacking drove away some large customers like Arthur Hayes, the founder of Bitmex, a Hong Kong-based virtual currency exchange.\u201cThere are so many questions about them,\u201d Mr. Hayes said. \u201cAll of this could be easily rectified by just showing all the figures.\u201dMr. van der Velde said the company had \u201cbeen as public and transparent as possible about the security incident in August 2016 given the ongoing criminal investigations.\u201dBanks have also been put off by Bitfinex\u2019s operations. Wells Fargo said this year that it would no longer move money from Bitfinex accounts. Shortly after, Bitfinex said its main banks in Taiwan were shutting it off. Since then, it has moved between a series of banks in other countries, without telling customers where the exchange\u2019s money is stored.But nothing has drawn more criticism than the operation of Tether, a virtual currency that is supposed to be tied \u2014 or tethered \u2014 to the value of a dollar.Lewis Cohen, a lawyer at the law firm Hogan Lovells who advises many virtual currency projects, said the document, because of the careful way it was phrased, did not prove that the Tether coins are backed by dollars.Even if they are, he said, Tether and Bitfinex appear to be violating laws in the United States and Europe that govern investments like Tether, which has qualities very similar to a money market mutual fund.\u201cThere are a long list of reasons that you don\u2019t want to deal with them,\u201d Mr. Cohen said of Tether.On Tuesday, Tether announced that an \u201cexternal attacker\u201d had taken $30 million worth of Tether from the company\u2019s online wallets. The company said it was working to recover the coins.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Finance Minister Seeks to Placate Angry Young Voters", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith a potentially perilous exit from the European Union looming, many Britons face a squeeze on living standards, but for one group, it may prove particularly tough.That danger could also prove critical for Mr. Hammond\u2019s Conservative Party. The divide between generations, long debated in Britain, became a newly urgent topic for the Conservatives after a general election in June, in which they unexpectedly lost their majority in Parliament. Young voters turned out in force for the opposition Labour Party, led by the left-wing Jeremy Corbyn.The budget introduced on Wednesday abolished the stamp duty, a tax paid on home purchases, for first-time buyers of properties costing up to 300,000 pounds, or about $397,000, and on the first \u00a3300,000 of first-time home purchases up to \u00a3500,000.That measure, however, could result in higher home prices instead of more affordable real estate, according to Britain\u2019s independent fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. It warned that \u201cthe main gainers\u201d from the policy could be \u201cpeople who already own property\u201d and are able to sell for even higher prices.Mr. Hammond also promised \u00a315.3 billion over five years for measures to encourage construction, and an inquiry into claims that developers were hoarding land on which houses could be built. The government was ready to use compulsory purchase powers \u201cas necessary,\u201d Mr. Hammond said.\u201cThis is our plan to deliver on the pledge we have made to the next generation, that the dream of homeownership will become a reality in this country once again,\u201d he said.Responding to Mr. Hammond\u2019s speech, Mr. Corbyn, the Labour leader, described it as \u201ca record of failure with a forecast of more.\u201d\u201cEconomic growth has been revised down,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said. \u201cProductivity growth has been revised down. Business investment revised down. People\u2019s wages and living standards revised down.\u201dThe finance minister\u2019s own political position is acutely vulnerable, and his room for maneuver limited, as he deals with slower than expected growth in productivity in Britain and as he prepares for the possibility that Brexit will significantly damage the economy.They include Nigel Lawson, a former chancellor, who called for Mr. Hammond to be fired, saying that his unwillingness to prepare for life without a Brexit agreement was \u201cvery close to sabotage.\u201dIn his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Hammond promised \u00a33 billion for Brexit preparations, in addition to \u00a3700 million already committed, adding, \u201cNo one should doubt our resolve.\u201dOn the question of housing affordability in Britain, most analysts blame a lack of supply, a view Mr. Hammond appears to accept.\u201cWe will not allow the current young generation to be the first since the Black Death not to be more prosperous than its parents\u2019 generation,\u201d he added.Housing is just one area in which Mr. Hammond\u2019s own lawmakers have demanded more spending, as evidence increases that services like health care are overstretched, and that Britons are fed up with the wage restraint and the cuts to government spending since the financial crisis.On Wednesday, Mr. Hammond promised \u00a33.75 billion more for Britain\u2019s National Health Service over the next three years, with the possibility of extra to cover a potential pay raise for nurses. Other measures included decision to expand a rail-travel discount program for people under 25 to include those under 30.Over all, the budget contained \u00a325 billion of new spending in total.So far the British economy has defied the worst predictions made in the run-up to the 2016 referendum. Borrowing has been slightly lower than predicted, giving a little more wiggle room in the short term. But, already, what was recently the fastest-growing developed economy has dropped to the bottom of that league, as businesses fret about investment decisions amid uncertainty about Brexit.Inflation has risen, largely because of a drop in the value of the pound against other currencies. That, in turn, has produced a small increase in interest rates. And with wage growth being sluggish, living standards have been squeezed.On Wednesday, Mr. Hammond announced that the Office for Budget Responsibility had cut its forecasts for economic growth over the next five years, based on lower growth in productivity.Where once it predicted growth of 2 percent in 2017, with a slowdown to 1.6 percent in 2018 followed by a gradual recovery back to 2 percent growth in 2021, the office now foresees growth of 1.5 percent in 2017, falling slightly over subsequent years and recovering only to 1.6 percent in 2022.\u201cFor a medium-sized open economy whose fortunes are strongly linked to its close neighbors, such a large downgrade is highly unusual,\u201d Kallum Pickering, a senior economist at Berenberg Bank, wrote in a note to clients. This, he added, \u201creflects the seriousness of the economic challenges facing the Brexit-stricken U.K. and the uncertainty about what is around the corner.\u201dMr. Hammond\u2019s basket of policies, including measures to ease the housing crunch, cut some income taxes and provide modest help to increase research and development, \u201cfall short of what is needed\u201d to improve long-term prospects, Mr. Pickering wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "World War II Seen by a Classicist, and Other New Books About Conflict", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWar StoriesIt often is difficult to pinpoint exact moments in long-term trends, but there is no question in my mind that the low point of the 20th-century United States military came on March 16, 1968, the day that Army soldiers massacred several hundred Vietnamese villagers, most of them women, children and old men, in the incident we remember as \u201cMy Lai.\u201dWe remember Lt. William Calley as the perpetrator. But we tend to forget that the events of that day were covered up by officers in the chain of command up to the level of generals. Indeed, the immediate reaction of one general involved was to suggest that charges be brought against an American helicopter pilot who tried to stop the shootings.Much of the book is written at the level of the strategic overview. Hanson notes, for instance, that both Germany and Japan probably would have won the war had they stopped early in 1941 and consolidated their gains in Europe and the western Pacific, without Germany attacking Russia and Japan pulling the United States into the conflict.One of Hanson\u2019s running themes is that the Allied victors mainly killed German and Japanese soldiers, while the Axis focused more on killing civilians. Over all, in its accounting of the global carnage, this book amounts to an ode in praise of deterrence and against appeasement and isolationism.Hanson is most original and enjoyable when he uses his professional background in ancient history to illuminate 20th-century war. He writes, for example, that, \u201clike Spartans, Wehrmacht soldiers were effused with militarist doctrine, chronically short of men, brilliantly led on the battlefield \u2014 and often deployed for imbecilic strategic ends.\u201d The Red Army\u2019s powerful new T-34 tanks \u201cshocked the Germans, not unlike the manner in which unfamiliar Parthian mounted archers flummoxed supposedly superior Roman Republican legions.\u201d The Allied landings on D-Day in 1944 amounted to \u201cthe largest combined land and sea operation conducted since the invasion of Greece by King Xerxes of Persia in spring 480 B.C.\u201d In fact, the book might have been better called \u201cA Classical Historian Assesses World War II.\u201dOddly, the title, \u201cAlone,\u201d is misleading, as Korda\u2019s story is not about England fighting alone against Germany \u2014 that is, from June 1940, when France dropped out, to June 1941, when Germany attacked Russia \u2014 but rather about the events leading up to that difficult time. Still, Korda\u2019s breezy book makes a fine introduction for anyone new to this fulcrum point of the 20th century.This unusual London prison camp went through three distinct phases. Early in the war it was used by British military intelligence to examine odd lots of prisoners \u2014 U-boat crews, unlucky German paratroopers and spies. Then, starting in 1944, it began to receive a flood of German prisoners, many of them senior commanders. After the war, it housed German officers suspected of war crimes. Some of the most startling interviews took place then, as \u00e9migr\u00e9 Jews listened to Waffen SS officers boast of the number of Jews they had killed. One British officer who had been captured during the war found himself interrogating the Gestapo officer who once had brutally interrogated him. This is a good story told poorly, as Fry tends to jump around in time and often repeat herself.Johnston, a correspondent for The Chicago Tribune, was a talented drifter and a bit of a scammer. He also was a relative newcomer to journalism when he lucked into being aboard a Navy ship that received a top secret transmission about the Japanese plans for the Battle of Midway. His news article about that, recklessly written and misleadingly edited, was never submitted to censorship, as was the normal practice.Anyone reading between the lines of the article could deduce that the United States Navy had broken the Japanese Navy\u2019s codes. President Franklin Roosevelt urged the Justice Department to prosecute the reporter and the anti-Roosevelt Tribune. But the Navy refused to discuss its code breaking with a grand jury, rightly fearing any additional publicity, and the case fizzled out. And the Japanese, arrogantly confident in the impenetrability of their codes, apparently did not notice the article and so never realized their secret dispatches were being read by the Navy.Military leadership is an endlessly interesting subject. Few human activities carry such a heavy triple burden \u2014 physical, intellectual and spiritual. Two new biographies of Hannibal, the great Carthaginian general, illustrate that well.Yet Hannibal seemed to have little idea of what to do to turn battlefield success against Rome into lasting victory over it. He wound up fighting up and down Italy for 16 years \u2014 at that point, almost a third of his life \u2014 only to be recalled to Carthage and then wind up in a lengthy exile.Reading about our Civil War is almost the opposite of reading about Hannibal. That is, we know so much about this war that we can examine it on an almost minute-by-minute basis, from the level of the generals down to the privates. Perhaps for that reason, there seems to be a kind of trend in Civil War studies to examine minor skirmishes and neglected periods in the conflict. It\u2019s the military history equivalent of \u201cinfill\u201d real estate development projects that focus on vacant lots and other neglected urban odds and ends.Two of my favorite kinds of military history offer opposite approaches to the subject.It\u2019s a lively if depressing story. It made me think that Communism arose in reaction to the Industrial Revolution, became a major force during the era of heavy industry, with all those spewing smokestacks \u2014 and then ended along with it. So, I wondered, will there be a similar political reaction to the Information Age? If so, is that new ideology already being born?Thomas E.

{"Headline": "After Doomed Whitefish Deal, Puerto Rico Asks Congress for $94 Billion", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 The governor of Puerto Rico and the chief executive of its beleaguered electric company faced hours of questioning on Tuesday in Congress, where skeptical legislators questioned whether to give the island an enormous aid package on the heels of a botched high-priced contract to fix its power grid.\u201cIf we get more resources to rebuild, people will come back to rebuild stronger,\u201d the governor said, alluding to the thousands of Puerto Ricans who have already left for Florida.In a report submitted to Congress, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 requested $15 billion for health care, without specifying what medical facilities needed to be fixed. He said the island needed another $8.4 billion for schools, without noting what damages the schools had incurred. The power grid, he said, needs $17.7 billion.\u201cI\u2019m looking at this \u2014 90 billion, 100 billion \u2014 a colony on Mars is the same amount,\u201d said Representative Jody Hice, Republican of Georgia, said at a House Natural Resources Committee hearing.Representative Garret Graves, Republican of Louisiana, asked why Congress should pay so much for Puerto Rico, when Puerto Ricans are exempt from most federal income taxes.Ricardo L. Ramos, the chief executive of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that he had hired Whitefish instead of enlisting the help of other utilities under mutual aid agreements because he did not have enough supplies for even his own crews.\u201cWe had no fuel, no phone, no internet. No nothing,\u201d Mr. Ramos said. \u201cHow could I bring more people into that situation?\u201dWhitefish was a contained unit with its own satellite phones and tents, he said.However, in emails released Monday between Prepa and Whitefish, it was clear that the Montana company had also struggled with housing and logistics, and that Prepa was able to accommodate them.In an email exchange between the chief executive of Whitefish, Andy Techmanski, and Prepa, Whitefish requested hotel rooms for his workers, and the utility provided 60 rooms for them. Whitefish had trouble bringing in materials, and needed help from both the Jacksonville Electric Authority and Prepa with logistical problems that were preventing the company from getting the work done.\u201cWe have 60 rooms at Verdanza hotel reserved to accommodate your first wave,\u201d wrote Ram\u00f3n Caldas Pag\u00e1n, a senior manager at Prepa, in an email response to Mr. Techmanski. \u201cWe need to know what are your needs to transport your equipment as soon as possible.\u201dAt the hearings, Mr. Ramos suggested that the procurement office and legal department at Prepa were to blame, and insisted that there had been no corruption. \u201cI don\u2019t know of anyone being offered a kickback,\u201d he said.The records were released by the House committee, which is seeking to strengthen the authority of the fiscal oversight board that manages Puerto Rico\u2019s finances.The documents showed that Puerto Rico\u2019s electric company disregarded its own lawyers\u2019 advice when it signed the contract. The agreement offered so few protections that it allowed some workers to bill for \u201cnearly every waking hour\u201d they were on the island, according to the House panel investigating the deal.Prepa\u2019s lawyers had recommendations on everything from how the contract could be terminated to how the rates should be set. But the guidance was not followed \u2014 and the final provisions agreed to were tilted in the Whitefish\u2019s favor, the records show. Even Prepa\u2019s own risk management officer had balked, because he was never offered the opportunity to evaluate the terms, nor did the office receive proof of insurance.\u201cWe are conscious of the urgency of the work to be done,\u201d Sammy Rodr\u00edguez Ortega, a Prepa executive, wrote in an Oct. 19 email to Prepa\u2019s finance director and staff lawyer. \u201cHowever, there are high risks associated with the scope of this work.\u201dThe emails show that a lawyer for FEMA in Puerto Rico had also expressed concerns.A spokesman for Whitefish, Ken Luce, said the company would cooperate with Congress.\u201cWhitefish Energy continues to make progress on our assigned work to restore electrical transmission infrastructure on Puerto Rico and our team of more than 500 workers remains fully committed to this mission,\u201d Mr. Luce said in a statement.The Army Corps of Engineers is overseeing power restoration efforts in Puerto Rico, but Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said the agency was slow to ramp up its work. Nearly eight weeks after Hurricane Maria trampled the island and tore up everything from transmissions towers to power poles and miles of lines, the grid is generating just 49 percent of its capacity.Kenneth Mapp, the governor of the United States Virgin Islands, also testified and offered a bleak view of conditions there, urging Congress to change the way it allocates medical and storm relief funds to the territories.Only 30 percent of residents have electricity after Hurricanes Irma and Maria pounded the islands, where nine schools and two hospitals were destroyed. Families are living in their cars and getting soaked in homes with no rooftops or walls, he said.\u201cWith each rainfall, families are being harmed,\u201d Mr. Mapp said.Deborah Acosta contributed reporting from New York.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Snub to U.S., Russia and Egypt Move Toward Deal on Air Bases", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Egypt, in what appeared to be a snub to the Trump administration, has reached a preliminary agreement to allow Russian military jets to use its airspace and bases, both sides said Thursday.If finalized, the agreement would give Russia its deepest presence in Egypt since 1973, when Cairo expelled the military of the Soviet Union and instead became Washington\u2019s closest Arab ally.The United States has provided Egypt more than $70 billion in aid in the four decades since, at a rate of more than $1.3 billion a year in recent years. The cost is often justified in part by the argument that it secures the use of Egypt\u2019s airspace and bases for the American military.Egyptian and American analysts called the preliminary deal the latest sign of the waning influence of the United States as President Trump has diminished its military and diplomatic footprint in the region and the world.\u201cPower abhors a vacuum and when the United States pulls back we can\u2019t be under the impression that the world is going to stand by and wait for us,\u201d said Matthew Spence, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy under the Obama administration, which faced similar criticism for its policy toward the region. \u201cThe danger, and the reality, is that other countries will take advantage of the opportunity presented when America chooses to pull back.\u201dIn practical terms, the presence of Russian jets in Egypt would raise concerns about the operational security of American military personnel and require coordinating with American military planes in the same airspace.\u201cIt\u2019s a major problem for the United States-Egypt defense relationship,\u201d said Andrew Miller, a former senior State Department official who is now at the Project on Middle East Democracy.It was unclear to what extent Washington was informed about the agreement. The Trump administration has not yet replaced the ambassador to Cairo, whose three-year term ended in July.Edgar Vasquez, a State Department spokesman, said only, \u201cWe are aware of these reports and are monitoring the situation.\u201dNorth Korea had tested its longest-range missile yet the day before, in defiance of bellicose warnings from Mr. Trump and at a time when the positions of assistant secretary of state for East Asia and American ambassador to South Korea both remain empty.The prime minister and Parliament of Britain, Washington\u2019s closest ally, have publicly rebuked Mr. Trump for promoting online videos from a British far-right group demonizing Muslims.The Obama administration had been criticized by allies for retreating from the Middle East, in particular for failing to intervene aggressively enough against the Iranian- and Russian-backed government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in his civil war against rebels challenging his rule.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has stepped in, expanding Moscow\u2019s influence in the Middle East and seeking to regain influence lost with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War and the expansion of America\u2019s military presence around the Persian Gulf and elsewhere.Russia has sought to make inroads with American allies as well. In September, it agreed to sell $2 billion worth of advanced missiles to Turkey, a NATO member that previously clashed with Russia over its Syria policy. In October, Russia agreed to sell $3 billion worth of missiles to Saudi Arabia, another close American ally on the other side of the Syrian conflict.With Washington seemingly in retreat, \u201cvery few if any of the states in the region are willing to rely solely on alliance with the United States and depend on the United States as the insurance policy for their security,\u201d said Gamal Abdel Gawad Soltan, a scholar at the Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, a state-financed research institute in Cairo.In contrast, he said, \u201cRussia has proven to be quite effective, and that has been attractive to countries around the region.\u201dEgypt, under the rule of Gamal Abdel Nasser, tried in the early 1950s to build counterbalancing alliances with the United States and the Soviet Union. But Washington soon lost patience with Nasser\u2019s nonalignment policy and his anti-colonialist speeches, and Egypt fell more fully into the camp of the Soviets until the 1970s, when President Anwar Sadat switched his allegiance to the West.Egypt\u2019s current president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who took power in a military takeover that ousted an Islamist president in 2013, has been rekindling Cairo\u2019s Cold War alliance with Moscow. American officials believed he may have been trying to press Washington to keep delivering more aid of its own, a variation of Nasser\u2019s strategy of playing off global rivals.But American officials have scoffed at the idea that Russia could provide the kind of military support that the Soviet Union once promised, much less replace the supplies, training and maintenance that the Egyptians have come to depend on from Washington.\u201cEgypt would often hold out Russia as an alternative to American cooperation, and our attitude to some degree was, \u2018Good luck with that!\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Spence, the former Defense Department official.But when the Obama administration temporarily suspended military aid to Egypt in 2013 in response to the government\u2019s mass shootings of more than a thousand of his political opponents, Mr. Sisi visited Moscow and agreed to buy $3.5 billion in jets, helicopters and missiles from Russia. Last year, the two countries held joint antiterrorism drills, with Russian paratroopers conducting training exercises in Egypt with Egyptian paratroopers.Egypt also signed a preliminary agreement for Russia to build nuclear power facilities in Egypt, although there has been no sign of any construction.Mr. Sisi and Mr. Putin have collaborated more concretely to support a shared ally in Libya, Gen. Khalifa Hifter, who is based in eastern Libya across the border from Egypt. Russia has established a small military presence in a remote part of Egypt\u2019s western desert to back the general, according to American officials briefed in the situation.Their support for General Hifter has put Egypt and Russia at odds with the United States and other Western powers, which have backed a unity government in Tripoli in an attempt to end the civil strife that has plagued Libya.It was not immediately clear what Egypt hoped to receive in return for allowing Russia to use its air bases or airspace. A draft agreement released by Moscow on Thursday gave Egypt only reciprocal rights to use Russian airspace or air bases, suggesting that Russia sought to obtain for free advantages for which the United States has being paying dearly for decades.Some analysts speculated that Cairo might hope to persuade Moscow to restore tourist flights that it cut off because of security concerns after militants downed a Russian chartered jet leaving the resort of Sharm el Sheikh two years ago.Egypt may also hope to persuade Russia to move ahead with the preliminary deal to build a nuclear power plant. \u201cThere is a long history of Russian preliminary agreements that take forever or never occur,\u201d said Mr. Miller, the former State Department official.Russian state media suggested that the agreement might help Moscow\u2019s military campaign in Syria, another area where Mr. Putin and Mr. Sisi have found common ground.Egypt\u2019s Persian Gulf patrons, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have viewed the fight against the Assad government as a proxy war against its regional ally, Iran. But Mr. Sisi has sometimes shown sympathy for Mr. Assad as a fellow strongman defending the status quo and fighting political Islam.Vladimir Fitin, head of the Near and Middle East Center at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, said that access to Egyptian airports would allow Russian military aircraft to refuel on their way to Syria, according to a report by RIA Novosti, a state-controlled Russian news service.Andrew Higgins contributed reporting from Moscow, Nour Youssef from Cairo, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Crisis, Angela Merkel Prefers Elections to Minority Rule", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany faced the greatest crisis of her career on Monday after negotiations to form a new government collapsed, shaking a country that is Europe\u2019s political and economic anchor.The breakdown abruptly raised the prospect of new elections in Germany. It came less than two months after the last elections seemed to assure that Ms. Merkel, an icon of Western democracy and values, would remain Germany\u2019s leader for a fourth term.The chancellor said she remained hopeful about forming a majority government. But if forced to choose, Ms. Merkel said, she would prefer to go through new elections rather than try to lead a minority government.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say never, but I am very skeptical, and believe that new elections would be the better way forward,\u201d the chancellor told the public broadcaster ARD.Calling new elections is not a straightforward procedure in Germany. Written with the unstable governments of the 1920s and 1930s and collapse of the Weimar Republic in mind, the German Constitution includes several procedural hurdles that would ensure a prolonged and difficult process.Some were quick to link Germany\u2019s disorder to a broader crisis of democracy in the West. \u201cThe unthinkable has happened,\u201d said Christiane Hoffmann, deputy head of the Berlin bureau of Der Spiegel, a German magazine. In that sense, she said, \u201cThis is Germany\u2019s Brexit moment, its Trump moment.\u201dOthers said Germany\u2019s troubles were in many ways just a sign that the country was becoming more normal, not less. Having had only four chancellors since 1982, the country has known only a string of centrist governments that governed by consensus.The crisis erupted seven weeks after the last election, which brought the right-wing Alternative for Germany, or AfD, into Parliament, and in some ways represented the return of politics to a country long deprived of debate and policy disagreements.\u201cIt\u2019s just another step in the long learning of democracy of Germany since World War II, going from a very stable proportional system to something more messy,\u201d said Henrik Enderlein, dean of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin.The bigger question, he said, was whether Ms. Merkel\u2019s pragmatic governing style had reached its limit in an era where people crave the clash of a wider spectrum of policies. \u201cHer \u00fcber-pragmatism is reaching its end,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a scenario where she returns to her previous position of power.\u201dMs. Merkel met in private on Monday with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who as head of state is charged with trying to break the deadlock in coalition talks. He could appoint a chancellor to lead a minority government or, failing that, set in motion the process for new elections.The potential for instability in Germany would be a major blow to the European Union. Ms. Merkel has been the region\u2019s dominant political figure of the past decade, credited with guiding the bloc through the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and, more recently, providing a powerful counterpoint to populists across the Continent and beyond.Financial markets reacted calmly to the turmoil in Berlin, calculating that the German economy could power through the uncertainty. After opening lower, the DAX index of major stocks closed the day higher. The euro fell slightly.But some economists warned that the longer-term effects could be more severe. A weak government might be unable to agree on needed improvements to infrastructure and the education system, for example.\u201cThe economic situation is very good,\u201d Christoph M. Schmidt, chairman of the German Council of Economic Experts, said in a statement. \u201cBut over the mid and long term there are big challenges, especially the demographic shift, digitalization, sensible development of the European Union, and climate change.\u201dEven so, political analysts had expected Ms. Merkel to form a new coalition government that would have allowed her to remain as chancellor. That may still happen, but it will be harder now, and it is unlikely to happen soon, experts say.Elsewhere in Europe, the possibility of a weakened Ms. Merkel and of an inward-looking Germany alarmed some leaders. The chancellor canceled a meeting in Berlin with Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands. In Paris, President Emmanuel Macron of France said that Ms. Merkel\u2019s difficulties were a serious hurdle to the partnership between their two countries.France has \u201cno interest in a worsening of the situation\u201d in Germany, Mr. Macron said in a statement on Monday. \u201cOur wish is that our main partner, for the sake of Germany and Europe, remains strong and stable, so that we can move forward together,\u201d he added.Mr. Macron will be aware that his agenda for the bloc, which includes a common defense force, a strengthened euro, and a joint finance minister, stands no chance without German backing.Ms. Merkel had originally set Friday as the deadline for reaching an agreement with the Free Democrats, the Greens, and the Christian Social Union, which forms a conservative bloc with the chancellor\u2019s Christian Democrats. From the outset, all of those parties had differed markedly on key issues, notably migration and climate policies, resulting in strained talks that led to open sniping.Ms. Merkel could try to approach the Social Democrats about forming another grand coalition. But the center-left party has served as the junior coalition partner to the Christian Democrats since 2013 and on Monday, the party\u2019s leader, Martin Schulz, said his group had no interest in another round.As for new elections, the president can set the process in motion by proposing Ms. Merkel as chancellor, which would be put to a vote in Parliament.If Ms. Merkel were to win a majority in the first round of voting, the president could then name her as chancellor. If not, lawmakers would vote again, within 14 days.If Ms. Merkel failed to win a majority in a second vote, then lawmakers would vote a third time and the candidate with the most votes would win. At that point, the president could name that person chancellor or simply dissolve the Parliament and order new elections, which would take place within 60 days.But there is no guarantee that elections would improve the situation: Recent opinion polls predict that a new vote would bring little change, compared to the result in September. A Forsa poll released last week showed Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives at 32 percent, the Social Democrats on 20 percent, the Free Democrats at 12 percent, the Greens 10 percent and the AfD 12 percent.Some worry that the AfD could benefit from the current chaos and increase its share of the vote.

{"Headline": "Tax Bill Thrown Into Uncertainty as First G.O.P. Senator Comes Out Against It", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Uncertainty gripped the Senate on Wednesday over efforts to pass a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax cut after a Wisconsin Republican became the first senator in his party to declare that he could not vote for the tax bill as written, and other senators expressed serious misgivings over the cost and effect on the middle class.The House is set on Thursday to pass its own version of the tax bill, which would cut taxes by more than $1.4 trillion over 10 years and broadly rewrite the business tax code. But as with the health care debate earlier this year, the Senate emerged as the inconstant ally in President Trump\u2019s pursuit of a major legislative accomplishment in his first year.Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, came out against both chambers\u2019 tax plans on Wednesday, saying that the bills favored corporations over small businesses and other so-called pass-through entities, whose owners pay taxes on profits through the tax code for individuals.\u201cThese businesses truly are the engines of innovation and job creation throughout our economy, and they should not be left behind,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current versions.\u201dSenators Susan Collins of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee have voiced their own concerns about the tax overhaul and have not committed to voting for the tax bill.\u201cI\u2019m still working with folks to see if there\u2019s some way to be assured as it relates to the deficit issue that we\u2019re not going to create harm,\u201d Mr. Corker said. \u201cThere\u2019s other senators who themselves want to ensure that we\u2019re doing something to strengthen our country relative to the deficits.\u201dHe added, \u201cI\u2019m not a yes, I\u2019m not a no.\u201dWith the House expected to pass its tax legislation, the fate of the overhaul fell into the hands of Republican senators, who grappled with the political prospects of passing a bill that critics said could undermine the health care system and favored companies over the middle class. The Senate has played the spoiler before: The House passed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act in May, only to see it fail in the Senate twice.Without the mandate, more people would be uninsured and premiums would rise.Senate Republicans, eager for a major legislative achievement after the Affordable Care Act debacle, have generally been enthusiastic about the tax overhaul. But given the party\u2019s slim 52-to-48 majority in the Senate, the reluctance of even a handful of Republican senators has left open the possibility that the tax bill will be further changed or face failure.Beyond Mr. Johnson, the support of several other Republican senators was not assured, including the three who killed the party\u2019s effort to repeal the health law this summer: Ms. Collins, John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\u201cI want to see the whole package before I make a decision,\u201d Mr. McCain said.On Wednesday, Ms. Collins expressed concern that middle-income consumers could see their tax cut erased by an increase in health insurance premiums caused by the repeal of the requirement that most people have insurance, known as the individual mandate.Other Republican senators, such as Mr. Corker and Jeff Flake of Arizona, are concerned about the national debt, which topped $20 trillion even before consideration of a tax plan that could add an additional $1.5 trillion over a decade.As the Senate Finance Committee continued its formal drafting of the bill, Democrats attacked Republicans for inserting the repeal of the individual mandate and for imposing a 2025 expiration date for individual tax cuts, even as they would make the corporate tax cut permanent.\u201cThis bill seems to get worse by the hour,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cThis is not just another garden variety attack on the Affordable Care Act; this is repeal of that law.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, played down the move to make the individual tax cuts temporary, not mentioning that change in an opening statement during \u201cmarkup\u201d of the bill on Wednesday in which he defended his party\u2019s right to undo the mandate. He later suggested that Republicans would be unlikely to resist if Democrats wanted to make those cuts permanent.The dozens of changes in the legislation would add more than $1.4 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years.Mr. Hatch and Mr. Wyden raised their voices and spoke over each other as they clashed over the injection of health care into the tax debate, with Mr. Hatch at one point demanding that his leadership of the committee be respected.\u201cLet me be in control of this committee, not you,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Another Senate panel, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, voted on Wednesday to approve legislation that would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling \u2014 an opening long sought by Republicans but ardently opposed by Democrats and environmentalists.That legislation is to be merged with the tax bill, which Republicans are planning to pass using special procedures that protect against a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Under that strategy, the drilling measure would share the protection from a filibuster.Allowing drilling in the wildlife refuge, known as ANWR, is a cherished goal of the energy committee\u2019s chairwoman, Ms. Murkowski. Given her vote this summer against repealing the Affordable Care Act, Ms. Murkowski is once again a closely watched figure as the Senate plunges back into a debate over health care. But this time, with the prospect of opening the wildlife refuge to drilling, Ms. Murkowski has a major reason to vote yes.\u201cMy whole focus this week, you\u2019re going to be shocked to know, has been ANWR,\u201d she told reporters on Wednesday, brushing aside a question about the individual mandate.In the House, the biggest threat comes from Republicans in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, who have fought to preserve the deduction for state and local taxes. The House bill allows the deduction of up to $10,000 in property taxes, but that provision has not been enough to win over a number of House Republicans.If all House members vote and every Democrat opposes the bill, Republican leaders can afford to lose no more than 22 of their members for it to pass.At least five Republicans from New York and three from New Jersey have come out against the House bill. Republican leaders could also lose votes from at least a few of their members from California, another high-tax state.\u201cIt\u2019s conceivable they could come up with some last-minute numbers that don\u2019t look so bad,\u201d said Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California. \u201cBut I did not go to my constituents and ask them to vote for me in order to increase their tax load, and the bill dramatically increases the tax load on a big chunk of my constituency.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy Fails to Qualify for the World Cup, and a Nation Mourns", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Many tragedies have befallen Italy in the last 60 years. Dozens of governments have collapsed. Earthquakes and terrorism have shaken cities. The French started adding cream to carbonara.But the failure of the national soccer team on Monday night to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1958 seems to be taking a place in the pantheon of Italian disasters.Italy exited the last World Cup in the first round, a setback that had already prompted anxiety about the future of Italian soccer. But for a country that puts the game so central to its national identity, Monday night\u2019s humiliation prompted an existential crisis.Cultural commentators said the result at the San Siro stadium in Milan reflected the failure of Italian society to move forward into modernity. It resulted from the rot and corruption in the Italian Football Federation, they said. Some politicians blamed immigration.Most of the front pages used the anguished expression of the 39-year-old goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who looked up to the sky with Job-like woe as the final whistle blew, to illustrate the nation\u2019s pain. The legendary keeper, who played a central role in Italy\u2019s World Cup victory in 2006, retired from the national team after the match, his 175th appearance in 20 years.\u201cTime goes by, and it\u2019s cruel, but that\u2019s how it is,\u201d he said as he fought back tears in remarks after the game. In a subsequent interview to the Italian state broadcaster RAI, the Juventus captain said he had sought not to cry in front of Italian children watching at home because he wanted them to dream about playing for the national team.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe failed at something that also means something on a social level.\u201dThe coach of Italy, Gian Piero Ventura, whose job looks precarious with officials and most of the country already calling for his head, reflected what many see as a national allergy to accountability. \u201cThe apocalypse is not a child only of tonight,\u201d he said after the game, declining to resign.As Italian websites exploded with Ikea-inspired Sweden jokes, including step-by-step instructions for Italians on how to make a \u201cg\u00f6l,\u201d some politicians tried to exploit the frustration.Financial analysts projected a loss of revenue to the national team of 100 million euros, or about $116 million, because of the failure to qualify for the World Cup.\u201cThere will be economic consequences to this defeat,\u201d Elisa Simoni, a left-leaning member of Parliament, told the news channel Sky TG24. Others suggested that Italy\u2019s victory at the World Cup in 2006 had contributed to a spike in employment and in the country\u2019s gross domestic product.Those days now seem far away.He added, with a statement characteristic of the day, that \u201centire generations have never known this tragic experience.\u201dItalian television offered blanket coverage of the debacle, sending reporters to Bari, Milan, Palermo, Rome and elsewhere to measure the impact of the national disaster.On a masochistic loop, TV channels played the lowlights from the match, including Italy\u2019s many missed chances and the players falling to the ground at the end. One commentator called it \u201cthe saddest night in the history of Italian soccer.\u201dOn the radio, usually esoteric news programs dedicated time to Italy\u2019s failure. It was not just about sport, expert after expert made clear, but about culture, and how Italy paled in comparison to Germany, \u201cwhich follows the rules.\u201dAnalysts noted that the Italian talent pool, once an ocean, had shrunk to a puddle because of competition from other sports. Maurizio Crosetti, a sportswriter for La Repubblica, said that the soccer disaster mirrored a crisis in Italian society. \u201cThis shows us anthropologically, culturally, how we have become, how we have been reduced,\u201d he wrote.The Italian government announced on Tuesday more growth in the economy this year, but that glimmer of good news was eclipsed by the prospect of a World Cup without Italy.Luca Lotti, the Italian sports minister, was among those seeking a silver lining. \u201cWe need to exploit this obviously negative occasion as an opportunity to rebuild Italian soccer,\u201d he told reporters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Catch-22 of Applying for Private Scholarships", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn CampusPrivate scholarships should be a lifeline for students who want to avoid debt. But there\u2019s an awful glitch in the system: Students who get private scholarships risk losing financial aid they were awarded from their state or school. Their private scholarships don\u2019t save them a dime.Like many students, when I thought about college I worried most about affording it. Rice University, in Houston, where I am a senior, is known for generous financial aid packages, but I still had to take out student loans to cover the full cost.As a college freshman, I saw an episode of \u201cShark Tank\u201d on which an entrepreneur claimed that millions of private scholarships go unused every year. He was pitching Mark Cuban and the other investors on an app that was intended to match students with private scholarships. I was fascinated: Maybe I could avoid taking on thousands of dollars in debt in college. All I had to do was answer a few questions, submit my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and personal statement, and wait to collect.But when I talked with friends who were also concerned about financing college, they told me that I probably shouldn\u2019t bother applying for private scholarships. They told me about a significant wrinkle in my plan. It\u2019s called \u201cscholarship award displacement.\u201dI learned that any money I received from private companies, my church or even from a crowdsourcing campaign had to be reported to my college or university. The school would then evaluate the reported funds, and could decrease my financial aid by the same amount.Universities argue that displacing scholarships allows them to better distribute funds to students in need. If one student receives $1,000 in private money, the argument goes, the university can give the $1,000 that would have gone to that student to somebody else. I understand that universities must save money, but they shouldn\u2019t try to do it by undercutting the students who pursue private financial assistance. Or as Mark Kantrowitz, a financial-aid expert, told me, \u201cScholarship displacement prevents students from getting the full value of the scholarships they earned through hard work.\u201dUniversities and lawmakers have created an environment in which students are tempted to avoid reporting their private scholarships, or avoid seeking private aid entirely.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Voice of Hate in America\u2019s Heartland", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUBER HEIGHTS, Ohio \u2014 Tony and Maria Hovater were married this fall. They registered at Target. On their list was a muffin pan, a four-drawer dresser and a pineapple slicer.Ms. Hovater, 25, was worried about Antifa bashing up the ceremony. Weddings are hard enough to plan for when your fianc\u00e9 is not an avowed white nationalist.But Mr. Hovater, in the days leading up to the wedding, was somewhat less anxious. There are times when it can feel toxic to openly identify as a far-right extremist in the Ohio of 2017. But not always. He said the election of President Trump helped open a space for people like him, demonstrating that it is not the end of the world to be attacked as the bigot he surely is: \u201cYou can just say, \u2018Yeah, so?\u2019 And move on.\u201dIt was a weeknight at Applebee\u2019s in Huber Heights, a suburb of Dayton, a few weeks before the wedding. The couple, who live in nearby New Carlisle, were shoulder to shoulder at a table, young and in love. He was in a plain T-shirt, she in a sleeveless jean jacket. She ordered the boneless wings. Her parents had met him, she said, and approved of the match. The wedding would be small. Some of her best friends were going to be there. \u201cA lot of girls are not really into politics,\u201d she said.In Ohio, amid the row crops and rolling hills, the Olive Gardens and Steak \u2019n Shakes, Mr. Hovater\u2019s presence can make hardly a ripple. He is the Nazi sympathizer next door, polite and low-key at a time the old boundaries of accepted political activity can seem alarmingly in flux. Most Americans would be disgusted and baffled by his casually approving remarks about Hitler, disdain for democracy and belief that the races are better off separate. But his tattoos are innocuous pop-culture references: a slice of cherry pie adorns one arm, a homage to the TV show \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d He says he prefers to spread the gospel of white nationalism with satire. He is a big \u201cSeinfeld\u201d fan.\u201cI guess it seems weird when talking about these type of things,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m coming at it in a mid-90s, Jewish, New York, observational-humor way.\u201dIts leaders claim to oppose racism, though the Anti-Defamation League says the group \u201chas participated in white supremacist events all over the country.\u201d On its website, a swastika armband goes for $20.If the Charlottesville rally came as a shock, with hundreds of white Americans marching in support of ideologies many have long considered too vile, dangerous or stupid to enter the political mainstream, it obscured the fact that some in the small, loosely defined alt-right movement are hoping to make those ideas seem less than shocking for the \u201cnormies,\u201d or normal people, that its sympathizers have tended to mock online.And to go from mocking to wooing, the movement will be looking to make use of people like the Hovaters and their trappings of normie life \u2014 their fondness for National Public Radio, their four cats, their bridal registry.\u201cWe need to have more families. We need to be able to just be normal,\u201d said Matthew Heimbach, the leader of the Traditionalist Worker Party, in a podcast conversation with Mr. Hovater. Why, he asked self-mockingly, were so many followers \u201cabnormal\u201d?Mr. Hovater replied: \u201cI mean honestly, it takes people with, like, sort of an odd view of life, at first, to come this way. Because most people are pacified really easy, you know. Like, here\u2019s some money, here\u2019s a nice TV, go watch your sports, you know?\u201dHe added: \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re seeing more and more normal people come is because things have gotten so bad. And if they keep getting worse, we\u2019ll keep getting more, just, normal people.\u201dMr. Hovater\u2019s face is narrow and punctuated with sharply peaked eyebrows, like a pair of air quotes, and he tends to deliver his favorite adjective, \u201cedgy,\u201d with a flat affect and maximum sarcastic intent. It is a sort of implicit running assertion that the edges of acceptable American political discourse \u2014 edges set by previous generations, like the one that fought the Nazis \u2014 are laughable.\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m some \u2018edgy\u2019 Republican,\u201d he says, while flatly denouncing the concept of democracy.\u201cI don\u2019t even think those things should be \u2018edgy,\u2019\u201d he says, while defending his assertion that Jews run the worlds of finance and the media, and \u201cappear to be working more in line with their own interests than everybody else\u2019s.\u201dHis political evolution \u2014 from vaguely leftist rock musician to ardent libertarian to fascist activist \u2014 was largely fueled by the kinds of frustrations that would not seem exotic to most American conservatives. He believes the federal government is too big, the news media is biased, and that affirmative action programs for minorities are fundamentally unfair.Ask him how he moved so far right, and he declares that public discourse has become \u201cso toxic that there\u2019s no way to effectively lobby for interests that involve white people.\u201d He name-drops Murray Rothbard and Hans-Hermann Hoppe, architects of \u201canarcho-capitalism,\u201d with its idea that free markets serve as better societal regulators than the state. And he refers to the 2013 science-fiction movie \u201cPacific Rim,\u201d in which society is attacked by massive monsters that emerge from beneath the Pacific Ocean.\u201cSo the people, they don\u2019t ask the monsters to stop,\u201d he says. \u201cThey build a giant robot to try to stop them. And that\u2019s essentially what fascism is. It\u2019s like our version of centrally coming together to try to stop another already centralized force.\u201dMr. Hovater grew up on integrated Army bases and attended a mostly white Ohio high school. He did not want for anything. He experienced no scarring racial episodes. His parents, he says, were the kinds of people who \u201calways assume things aren\u2019t going well. But they don\u2019t necessarily know why.\u201dHe is adamant that the races are probably better off separated, but he insists he is not racist. He is a white nationalist, he says, not a white supremacist. There were mixed-race couples at the wedding. Mr. Hovater said he was fine with it.\u201cThat\u2019s their thing, man,\u201d he said.Online it is uglier. On Facebook, Mr. Hovater posted a picture purporting to show what life would have looked like if Germany had won World War II: a streetscape full of happy white people, a bustling American-style diner and swastikas everywhere.\u201cWhat part is supposed to look unappealing?\u201d he wrote.After he attended the Charlottesville rally, in which a white nationalist plowed his car into a group of left-wing protesters, killing one of them, Mr. Hovater wrote that he was proud of the comrades who joined him there: \u201cWe made history. Hail victory.\u201dIn German, \u201cHail victory\u201d is \u201cSieg heil.\u201dBefore white nationalism, his world was heavy metal. He played drums in two bands, and his embrace of fascism, on the surface, shares some traits with the hipster\u2019s cooler-than-thou quest for the most extreme of musical subgenres. Online, he and his allies can also give the impression that their movement is one big laugh \u2014 an enormous trolling event put on by self-mocking, politically incorrect kids playing around on the ash heap of history.On the party\u2019s website, the swastika armband is formally listed as a \u201cNSDAP LARP Armband.\u201d NSDAP was the abbreviation for Hitler\u2019s Nazi Party. LARP stands for \u201cLive-Action Role Playing,\u201d a term originally meant to describe fantasy fans who dress up as wizards and warlocks.But the movement is no joke. The party, Mr. Hovater said, is now approaching 1,000 people. He said that it has held food and school-supply drives in Appalachia. \u201cThese are people that the establishment doesn\u2019t care about,\u201d he said.Marilyn Mayo, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, estimated that the Traditionalist Worker Party had a few hundred members at most, while Americans who identify as \u201calt-right\u201d could number in the tens of thousands.\u201cIt is small in the grand scheme of things, but it\u2019s one of the segments of the white supremacist movement that\u2019s grown over the last two years,\u201d she said.It was midday at a Panera Bread, and Mr. Hovater was describing his political awakening over a turkey sandwich. He mentioned books by Charles Murray and Pat Buchanan. He talked about his presence on 4chan, the online message board and alt-right breeding ground (\u201cThat\u2019s where the scary memes come from,\u201d he deadpanned). He spoke dispassionately about the injustice of affirmative action, about the \u201cmalice directed toward white people\u201d in popular media, about how the cartoon comedy \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d was the last TV show to portray \u201ca straight white male patriarch\u201d in a positive light.\u201cI think he was a guy who really believed in his cause,\u201d he said of Hitler. \u201cHe really believed he was fighting for his people and doing what he thought was right.\u201dHe said he wanted to see the United States become \u201can actually fair, meritocratic society.\u201d Absent that, he would settle for a white ethno-state \u201cwhere things are fair, because there\u2019s no competing demographics for government power or for resources.\u201dHis fascist ideal, he said, would resemble the early days in the United States, when power was reserved for landowners \u201cand, you know, normies didn\u2019t really have a whole hell of a lot to say.\u201dHis faith in mainstream solutions slipped as he toured the country with one of the metal bands. \u201cI got to see people who were genuinely hurting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe played coast to coast, but specifically places in Appalachia, and a lot of the Eastern Seaboard had really been hurt.\u201dIn 2012, Mr. Hovater was incensed by the media coverage of the Trayvon Martin shooting, believing the story had been distorted to make a villain of George Zimmerman, the white man who shot the black teenager. By that time, he and Ms. Hovater had been dating for a year or two. She was a small-town girl who had fallen away from the Catholic Church (\u201cIt was just really boring\u201d), and once considered herself liberal.But in the aftermath of the shooting, Ms. Hovater found herself on social media \u201cquestioning the official story,\u201d taking Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s side and finding herself blocked by some of her friends. Today, she says, she and Mr. Hovater are \u201cpretty lined up\u201d politically.As they let their views be known, friends left and friends stayed.\u201cHis views are horrible and repugnant and hate-filled,\u201d said Ethan Reynolds, a Republican and city councilman in New Carlisle, Ohio, who said he had befriended Mr. Hovater without knowing his extremism. \u201cHe was an acquaintance I regret knowing.\u201dJake Nolan, a guitarist in one of the bands Mr. Hovater played in, stuck with him. \u201cThere are people who literally go around Sieg Heiling,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you have the people who just want the right to be proud of their heritage\u201d \u2014 people, he said, who are standing up against \u201cwhat appears to be an increasingly anti-white America.\u201dSoon Mr. Hovater was telling people that he would be running for a council seat in his hometown, New Carlisle, population 5,600. The announcement caught the attention of the Southern Poverty Law Center and the heavy metal press. But he never filed papers.On a recent weekday evening, Mr. Hovater was at home, saut\u00e9ing minced garlic with chili flakes and waiting for his pasta to boil. The cats were wandering in and out of their tidy little rental house. Books about Mussolini and Hitler shared shelf space with a stack of Nintendo Wii games. A day earlier, a next-door neighbor, whom Mr. Hovater doesn\u2019t know very well, had hung a Confederate flag in front of his house.\u201cThis is kind of brackish territory here,\u201d Mr. Hovater said. \u201cA lot of people consider Cincinnati the most northern Southern city.\u201dThe pasta was ready. Ms. Hovater talked about how frightening it was this summer to watch from home as the Charlottesville rally spun out of control. Mr. Hovater said he was glad the movement had grown.They spoke about their future \u2014 about moving to a bigger place, about their honeymoon, about having kids.Advertisement"}

Since then, he has been holed up inside the Saudi version of prison for the ultrawealthy: the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, about a 10-minute drive from the prince\u2019s home.He hasn\u2019t been heard from, nor have any charges against him been made public.Because he was the longtime public face of finance for Saudi Arabia, Prince Alwaleed\u2019s arrest \u2014 and the lack of transparency around what has happened to him \u2014 is causing increasing consternation among his various business partners and in much of the Western business community.His arrest has also created a sense of uncertainty among investors about whether to do business with Saudi Arabia and, by extension, could affect some of its partners, like Masayoshi Son\u2019s $100 billion SoftBank fund, in which the kingdom holds a 45 percent stake. It could also affect the highly anticipated public offering of the state-owned oil company, Aramco, planned for next year.\u201cI\u2019m surprised that he got swept up in this, because he had always been such a positive figure both in reality and symbolically for Saudi progressivism \u2014 for participating in the modern world, in modern finance,\u201d said Richard Parsons, a former chief executive of Time Warner and former chairman of Citigroup, in which the prince had also been a large investor.\u201cWhat is this all about?\u2019\u2019 Mr. Parsons added. \u201cThere is no transparency. Nobody understands what is going on. It is unclear why or what the rationale is. If you\u2019re an investor or a businessperson, you\u2019re going to take a step back from the starting line and say, \u2018I\u2019m just going to keep my money in my pocket.\u2019\u201dKnown as the Warren Buffett of the Middle East, the prince has worked with Bill Gates on various projects, including their ownership of the Four Seasons resorts and several philanthropic endeavors.\u201cI\u2019m only aware of what I\u2019ve read in the press, and I can\u2019t speculate,\u201d Mr. Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder, said by email. \u201cPrince Alwaleed has been an important partner in my foundation\u2019s work to ensure that kids around the world receive lifesaving vaccinations. We\u2019ve worked together to help stop the spread of polio, measles and other preventable diseases. His commitment to philanthropy is inspiring.\u201dThe Saudi Arabian government has officially described the arrest of Prince Alwaleed and dozens of other princes and businessmen as part of a long-planned \u201canticorruption\u201d effort. Inside the kingdom, the arrests were welcomed by many, especially by millennials, who think their job prospects and economic growth have been slowed by a culture of graft.But outside the country, questions remain. The arrests have been called everything from a power grab by the crown prince, to a shakedown, to a Saudi version of \u201cthe Saturday Night Massacre.\u201dStill, the kingdom expects to reach \u201csettlements\u201d with those who have been arrested, and the crown prince said he expected to recover $100 billion. It remains unclear where those who reach settlements will go after leaving the Ritz; some are expected to remain living in Saudi Arabia while others may leave the country.The arrest of Prince Alwaleed, however, has seemingly made some skittish and is likely to slow the pace of investment, at least in the short term.\u201cWhen people talk about where to invest outside of the U.S., you always hear the term \u2018rule of law,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Parsons, who was among a dozen or so American executives who spoke to me about their concerns, most asking for anonymity so as not to upset their relationship with the Saudis.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to take for granted if nothing untoward has happened or there hasn\u2019t been any turbulence,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as you see something that is difficult to understand in terms of how investors and investments are being treated, \u2018rule of law\u2019 all of sudden leaps up off the canvas.\u201dSeveral executives who do business in the kingdom said it wasn\u2019t the mass arrests of other public officials or elites that concerned them so much as the arrest of Prince Alwaleed himself. It put a prominent face on the unsettling news.His arrest has led to rampant speculation about the charges against him, with many questioning whether the kingdom might seek to take over his ownership of Rotana, the largest entertainment company in the region. The kingdom has sought more and more control over messaging, and Rotana owns television, film, music, magazine and radio assets.Some close to the prince privately question why, if he was under investigation, the government granted him permission to acquire a 16 percent stake in Saudi Fransi from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole for $1.5 billion in September \u2014 one of the largest finance deals in the country. The deal required the approval of regulators who would have surely known about the inquiry. The crown prince told Mr. Friedman that government had been working on the corruption cases for the past two years.Within the world of Silicon Valley, which the crown prince has been assiduously courting over the past several years \u2014 including a trip last year when he met with Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive \u2014 there are lingering questions about the implications of taking money from the country. Saudi Arabia took a direct stake in Uber, for example, and through its investment in Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund it has acquired pieces of companies like WeWork and Slack. Privately, some investors also grumble about the close ties that the Saudi government has with President Trump, an unpopular figure with many in Silicon Valley.Uber\u2019s new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, told me two weeks ago that the company had discussed whether to take the Saudi money. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there, but at the time when we took the money \u2014 because I asked the team about it \u2014 the company definitely talked about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say the most important issue for the company was the women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia.\u201dHe added: \u201cAnd the company explicitly talked about how we actually believe that women should be able to drive. And since then, the changes that we\u2019re seeing \u2014 the cultural changes that we\u2019re seeing in Saudi Arabia \u2014 they are unambiguously positive.\u201dWith some more transparency and answers about the fate of Prince Alwaleed, many more American business executives and investors would feel the same way.An earlier version of this article misidentified a former title of Richard Parsons.

{"Headline": "Initial Coin Offerings Horrify a Former S.E.C. Regulator", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Members of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s staff have been hearing recently from a former colleague with an urgent question: Why aren\u2019t you cracking down on these initial coin offerings?Initial coin offerings are a relatively new method that entrepreneurs have used to raise money for start-ups, by selling custom-built virtual currencies. The practice has taken off this year, despite the warnings of regulators and the uncertainty of the rules concerning the fund-raising method.Joseph Grundfest, who was a commissioner at the S.E.C. in the 1980s and is now a law and business professor at Stanford, said he had been contacting current commission officials and staff to urge them to bring cases, and fast.\u201cI.C.O.s represent the most pervasive, open and notorious violation of federal securities laws since the Code of Hammurabi,\u201d Mr. Grundfest said in an interview.\u201cIt\u2019s more than the extent of the violation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the almost comedic quality of the violation.\u201dA spokeswoman for the S.E.C. did not respond to a request for comment.Start-ups have raised more than $3 billion this year from investors through coin offerings. Most start-ups say the coins they are selling will be useful as a method of payment in the online services they are building.Coin offerings generally happen without the involvement of financial institutions or regulators because investors pay for the coins using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, which can be sent outside the traditional financial system.Regulators in China and South Korea have recently banned such offerings outright.In the United States, the S.E.C. has brought one case against a small fraudulent coin offering. The agency has also warned that at least some coins being sold could be considered securities, and would be in violation of securities law if not registered with the authorities \u2014 and few are.But Mr. Grundfest, who is also a co-director of the Rock Center for Corporate Governance, said the continuing flow of new coin offerings showed that the warnings were not nearly enough.\u201cWe\u2019re waiting to see a whole bunch of enforcement actions in this space, and we wonder why they haven\u2019t happened yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope what they are doing is planning on a sweep of 50 I.C.O.s.\u201dBut Mr. Grundfest\u2019s words could carry more weight, both because he is close to the technology world near Stanford and because he knows what it takes to bring federal securities cases.He said the most obvious way for regulators to go after initial coin offerings would be to label them as securities and punish them for not registering with the authorities.\u201cWhere we see fraud, and where we see people engaging in offerings that are not registered, we are going to pursue them because these types of things have a destabilizing effect on the market,\u201d Mr. Clayton said in a meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Mr. Grundfest said that he would welcome this, but that he did not think it should have taken this long.\u201cThese are not hard cases,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need teams of accountants poring over complex financing documents.\u201dMany companies offering coins have argued that they are not securities because they will have utility on the networks the companies are building.But Mr. Grundfest said it was clear that almost everyone buying tokens at this point was buying them with the hope that their value would go up, not because the buyer wanted to use them on some future computer network.Mr. Grundfest said he thought that the concept of a coin offering could be a useful innovation for certain types of fund-raising. It could, he said, make sense for a company building a decentralized cloud storage network, which could then use the coin as a means of payment and record keeping on the network.But he said almost none of the projects currently raising money through coin offerings had a need for the novel structure.\u201cIs this amazing technology? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most of the stuff we see today is total crap.\u201dMr. Grundfest said several teams looking at doing offerings had approached him to ask how to do it right.\u201cI say, \u2018Look, you are at very high risk for violating the securities law,\u2019 and explain why,\u201d he said. \u201cThen they go find another lawyer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Kochs Are Inching Closer to Becoming Media Moguls", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMedia MemoFour years ago, Charles G. and David H. Koch seemed poised to control some of the country\u2019s biggest newspapers. Known for using their vast wealth and network of donors to advance their brand of libertarian-infused conservatism, the titans of Koch Industries explored buying the Tribune Company\u2019s eight newspapers, including The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune.They ended up not making a bid, and in an interview at the time with his hometown paper, The Wichita Eagle, Charles Koch suggested that Koch Industries was rethinking whether it was wise to enter such a troubled industry.\u201cThere are tremendous changes going on in media,\u201d Charles Koch said. \u201cWe\u2019re back at square one, analyzing where is the most change, where are the best opportunities for new entrants to come in and add value?\u201dThe answer, it appears, was the magazine business.Meredith and Time Inc. have discussed the details of a potential transaction over the last week and are hoping to announce a deal, should it occur, on the Monday after Thanksgiving. Under the preliminary terms of Meredith\u2019s proposal, the company would pay $18 to $20 a share for Time Inc., people involved in the talks said.Meredith, the Iowa-based company behind popular monthly magazines like Family Circle and Better Homes and Gardens, has arranged for a $600 million cash infusion from the Koch brothers through their private equity arm, Koch Equity Development, these people said. Under the terms of the proposal, Koch would receive preferred shares in the company.According to people involved in the talks, Meredith has also lined up $3 billion in financing from four banks: Citibank, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Royal Bank of Canada. Meredith has been busy lately reviewing Time Inc.\u2019s financials, which have become somewhat complicated, because the company had been in the process of selling several magazines including Sunset and Golf and a stake in Essence.Meredith has indicated that it would acquire all of Time Inc.\u2019s properties, but was still seeking clarification about the status of those sales, these people said.The Kochs have long tried to shape political discourse through their support of nonprofit organizations, universities and think tanks. Beyond their flirtation with Tribune, they have expressed little interest in running a media company.Some Koch allies suggested that the brothers\u2019 investment would be passive and would not give them any operational control over the company. These people said that the Kochs saw a potential moneymaker in Time Inc., rather than a megaphone for advancing their free-market ideology. For that to happen, the storied company, which Henry R. Luce helped found in 1922, would have to morph into an entity able to thrive in the fraught 21st-century media business.Other Koch associates, however, surmised that the Kochs\u2019 involvement in the possible deal was partly driven by their desire to advance their views. Should Meredith succeed in acquiring Time Inc., Koch Industries would have a stake in a company with access to millions of online and print readers.\u201cKnowing the Kochs, I think they\u2019d have to see it as a business that could at the same time further their political interests,\u201d said Stanley S. Hubbard, a longtime associate of the brothers and a donor to their advocacy groups.Although it now has a diminished role in the crowded landscape, Time magazine, with its influential Person of the Year and Time 100 issues, still reaches a weekly paid audience of roughly three million.Mr. Hubbard said he doubted the Koch brothers approved of Time in its current form. \u201cIn their view,\u201d he said, \u201cthey probably see Time magazine as a left-wing rag. I\u2019m sure that they would like to see it be more objective and also to straighten it out to make it a profitable venture.\u201dMr. Hubbard, who owns television and radio stations across the United States, said he had not talked with the Kochs about the possible acquisition but had discussed other prospective media investments with them over the years.Spokesmen for Koch Industries and the Kochs\u2019 political operation both declined to comment. Spokesmen for Time Inc. and Meredith also declined to comment.For Meredith, which was founded in 1902, the addition of the Time Inc. titles to its stable would represent the culmination of a yearslong courtship. In 2013, a deal between the two publishers collapsed after Meredith reportedly said it had no interest in some of Time Inc.\u2019s most robust titles, including Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated.Meredith was also among the parties circling Time Inc. earlier this year before it walked away in part because it could not secure sufficient financing.The Kochs, who have made a name for themselves as philanthropists with their donations to Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, have preferred to wield their influence away from the glare that comes with owning major media properties. Through a network of conservative donors and advocacy groups, they have spent or raised more than $1.5 billion in an effort to reshape American policy around an ideology based on free-market Austrian economics.Their foundations have helped fund organizations affiliated with conservative media outlets, including the libertarian Reason magazine and the Daily Caller website. The Charles Koch Institute, one of the brothers\u2019 philanthropic arms, offers a yearlong media and journalism fellowship. David Koch has donated millions to public television.Media properties with a wider reach than, say, Reason magazine, like those in the portfolios of Meredith and Time Inc., could amplify the Kochs\u2019 message and complement the work of the groups they support, including the nonprofit advocacy group Americans for Prosperity. The completion of the proposed deal may also give the Kochs a way to merge the vast trove of voter information held by a data analytics company controlled by their network, i360, with the publishers\u2019 data on consumers.Still, the Kochs would make for unlikely media players, given that they have not exactly been champions of reporters in the past.Known for harboring a distrust of the mainstream media and what they see as its liberal bias, the Kochs have taken a closed-fist approach to journalists. Until 2015, a website affiliated with Koch Industries, KochFacts.com, published blog posts intended to combat negative coverage of the company and to raise questions about reporters who, in the Kochs\u2019 estimation, had written about them unfairly.\u201cWe\u2019re being attacked every day by blogs, other newspapers, media, people in government,\u201d he said, \u201cand they were totally perverting what we do and why we do it.\u201dAndrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeremy Hutchinson, a Top Lawyer in High-Profile Cases, Dies at 102", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Jeremy Hutchinson, a British barrister whose sometimes theatrical courtroom tactics and rhetorical panache secured victories that helped reshape society\u2019s attitudes toward obscenity, secrecy and sexual manners, died on Monday. He was 102.From the 1960s to the \u201980s, Mr. Hutchinson, ennobled by the British royal family in 1978 as Lord Hutchinson of Lullington, joined or led legal teams in some of the most celebrated cases of that era, establishing himself as a top criminal defense lawyer.It was a time in which the erosion of moral taboos in the swinging \u201960s and the cloak-and-dagger machinations of the Cold War combined to produce a steady supply of dramatic trials.Mr. Hutchinson defended Penguin Books for publishing D. H. Lawrence\u2019s \u201cLady Chatterley\u2019s Lover\u201d; represented the model Christine Keeler in the so-called Profumo Affair, which combined sex, spies and scandal; and sought unsuccessfully to avert a 42-year jail term for George Blake, a Soviet double agent who later escaped from a British prison and fled to Moscow.Mr. Hutchinson often fought against the prevailing definitions of obscenity in cases that were seen as landmarks in Britain\u2019s transition from a prudish and hidebound society to a more open and tolerant one.In 1960, as a junior counsel in the \u201cLady Chatterley\u201d case, he played a prominent part in examining prestigious witnesses, including the novelist E. M. Forster, to support the argument that the novel, which explicitly describes the physical relationship between an upper-crust married woman and her husband\u2019s gamekeeper, was a work of literature, not pornography.\u201cI believe you have written some novels,\u201d he said in addressing Mr. Forster before the court to establish the author\u2019s credentials.Mr. Hutchinson also sought to ensure that the jury included as many women as possible because, he said, \u201cwomen are much more sensible about sex \u2014 men get so worked up about it.\u201dThe trial fascinated ordinary Britons and seemed to illuminate the gulf between them and a judiciary largely drawn from the elite. Indeed, the prosecutor in the trial, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, went so far as to ask whether \u201cLady Chatterley\u201d was \u201ca book you would wish your wives or servants to read\u201d \u2014 a question redolent with assumptions about class, gender and lifestyle from an earlier era.Mr. Hutchinson, for his part, was the first to admit that as he tilted in court against the British establishment, he was also very much a product of it, having been educated at private school and Oxford University.In 1963, he defended Christine Keeler, a model and showgirl who pleaded guilty to committing perjury as a witness in earlier trials relating to the Profumo Affair, which almost brought down the conservative government of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.The scandal involved John Profumo, the minister for war, who was accused of sharing Ms. Keeler\u2019s sexual favors with Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet naval attach\u00e9, thereby possibly endangering national security. Mr. Profumo was forced to quit, while Ms. Keeler acquired a reputation in the press as a temptress.Mr. Hutchinson, by contrast, depicted her in court as a vulnerable young woman who had been used by many male partners and should not suffer retribution. \u201cI know your lordship will resist the temptation for what I might call society\u2019s pound of flesh,\u201d he told the judge.She was given a relatively brief prison term of nine months.In 1982, in another well-publicized case that again involved the issue of obscenity, Mr. Hutchinson defended the director of a play called \u201cThe Romans in Britain\u201d against charges of gross indecency. The case, brought by Mary Whitehouse, a prominent campaigner for moral standards, alleged that Graham Ross-Cornes, her solicitor, had spied an exposed erect penis during a performance of the play.But Mr. Hutchinson demonstrated with theatrical gestures that what Mr. Ross-Cornes had really seen was an actor\u2019s thumb. The case against the director was dropped.Jeremy Nicolas Hutchinson was born in London on March 29, 1915, to parents who belonged to the literary clique known as the Bloomsbury Set. His father, St. John Hutchinson, was also a barrister, and his mother, the former Mary Barnes, was widely believed to have been the model for the title character in Virginia Woolf\u2019s 1925 novel, \u201cMrs. Dalloway.\u201dMr. Hutchinson attended private school at Stowe in Buckinghamshire, west of London, and studied at Magdalen College, Oxford.During World War II, he served in the Royal Navy and was aboard the destroyer H.M.S. Kelly when German warplanes sank it off the Greek island of Crete in May 1941. He was rescued after hours at sea, clinging to debris and singing vaudeville songs with other survivors, including the ship\u2019s commander, Lord Louis Mountbatten, a descendant of Queen Victoria. Mountbatten became First Sea Lord and mentor to Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne.Mr. Hutchinson had two children by his first marriage \u2014 a daughter, Eliza, an artist who died in 2016, and a son, Nicholas, an actor and director. Complete information on his survivors was not available, though some biographical sources say he had grandchildren.After the war, Mr. Hutchinson stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in the Westminster district of central London, where one of his constituents was Winston Churchill. Mr. Hutchinson, resolving to canvass the district for support, went to 10 Downing Street, the official residence of British prime ministers. Churchill was not home, however, so Mr. Hutchinson delivered a political speech to Churchill\u2019s staff.He financed his early days as a barrister by selling a painting by Monet, which he had inherited.Among his less successful trials as a senior barrister was his defense of George Blake, unmasked in 1961 as a double agent who had used his position at Britain\u2019s foreign intelligence service, MI6, to aid the Soviet K.G.B. in the earliest days of the Cold War. He was sentenced under the Official Secrets Act to three consecutive 14-year terms in prison for his offenses.Mr. Hutchinson said the severity of Mr. Blake\u2019s punishment would provoke either madness or escape \u2014 a prophecy fulfilled in 1966 when Mr. Blake broke out of Wormwood Scrubs prison in London and was spirited to Moscow, where he is believed to still be living at 95.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit Cost Rises as Britain Retreats on Divorce Demands", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat Mr. Johnson was saying was that Britain could secure the economic benefits of membership in the European Union without paying a penalty or being subject to its rules, particularly on the free movement of labor within the bloc.For months, supporters of the withdrawal, known as Brexit, have rejected the idea of paying a substantial exit bill to honor commitments. Some, like the Euroskeptic lawmaker John Redwood has insisted that Britain owed nothing at all.Yet, with time running out for Britain before it departs in March 2019, such pledges have collided, brutally, with reality.In the meantime, other reversals are quietly underway. Lawmakers were initially told that European Union law would cease to apply to Britain in March 2019, when it leaves. Now, the government has accepted that during the sort of \u201cstandstill\u201d transition that Britain badly wants, European rules \u2014 including new ones \u2014 will apply to Britain, as will judgments of the European Court of Justice.During this standstill transition \u2014 which Mrs. May suggests could be two years \u2014 Britain will also have to accept the free movement of European citizens and will not be able to control migration from the Continent \u2014 even though immigration was perhaps the argument that proved decisive in the referendum.Britain\u2019s new pragmatism stands in contrast to some early remarks by Prime Minister Theresa May, who insisted that no deal with the European Union was better than a bad one, implying that she was ready to walk away from the table.But the reality, analysts and business leaders have been saying with increasing emphasis, is that Mrs. May desperately needs to show progress on a reasonable departure plan, not a \u201ccliff edge\u201d exit that would potentially throw the economy into chaos. Business leaders have warned repeatedly that they will be forced to begin shifting operations out of Britain in the new year if nothing further is accomplished.Supporters of the government argue that some of the European Union\u2019s initial demands for an exit payment were higher than those now being discussed, and that after it withdraws, Britain will not make its regular contributions of around $11 billion a year.In reality, Britain already had a weak hand, which has been made worse by the fact that Mrs. May, who argued tepidly to remain in the European Union during the 2016 referendum, has had to placate her more ideologically pro-Brexit colleagues. They fretted about any delay to Britain\u2019s departure, so in March Mrs. May triggered the exit procedure, before Britain was fully prepared, by invoking Article 50 of the European Union\u2019s treaty, which put negotiations under a two-year deadline.It hardly helped that Mrs. May then called a general election during which she lost valuable negotiating time and sacrificed her parliamentary majority, and with it her authority \u2014 allowing her cabinet to go to war over Brexit strategy.In the meantime, economic signals have grown increasingly alarming. Despite referendum promises of a rosy future, Britain\u2019s economy has sunk from being the fastest-growing among developed nations to the slowest. Investment in critical sectors like the auto industry has contracted sharply.Inflation has spiked due a significant fall in the value of the pound sterling since the referendum, putting a squeeze on living standards. Consumer spending is down, with car sales falling for seven consecutive months. According to some estimates, living standards will not return to their 2008 values until 2022 at the earliest.The gloom was compounded when Britain recently lost the right to host two European Union agencies, for medicine and finance, which will relocate to the Continent.Mrs. May needs to get agreement on starting talks future trade arrangements at a meeting of European leaders in mid-December. That may be possible given her new offer on the divorce, providing that a way forward can be found on the other tricky issue, the border with Ireland.Even then, Britain is unlikely to achieve the ambitious trade deal with the bloc that it wants, analysts say.\u201cAlthough the current focus is on the separation, the next phase of the talks could prove much harder and more acrimonious,\u201d wrote Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute, in an analysis. \u201cE.U. negotiators think the British government is deluded about the kind of future relationship it can achieve.\u201dSomewhat surprisingly, the growing cost of Brexit (\u00a33 billion has been allocated for preparations, to add to the \u00a3700 million already spent) has proved less problematic among Mrs. May\u2019s Conservatives, or Tories, than some expected.The small band of pro-European Tories want to keep good relations with the European Union, and therefore think that the exit bill is justified.By contrast, Brexit enthusiasts know that, however happy they would be to crash out of the bloc without a deal, that prospect would spook business and could prompt a damaging downturn. That, in turn, might provoke a shift in public opinion against Brexit, which could endanger support for the departure before it is completed.So, ardent supporters of Brexit on Wednesday were putting their best gloss on the multibillion euro divorce settlement they neglected to mention to voters in 2016.One of those, the former Conservative Party leader and prominent pro-Brexit campaigner, Iain Duncan Smith, told the BBC that Britain is, \u201cgetting a bargain just by leaving the E.U.\u201d That, analysts were quick to note, was a far cry from previous promises.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Getting the House Ready for Winter", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis fall has been a balmy one, but winter is coming. For homeowners living in colder climates, the waning hours of daylight signal the time to start readying the home for snowy days and bitter nights ahead.Even seasoned homeowners, however, can fall behind. With such an unusually warm autumn, Ms. Levy, an associate broker with Halstead, forgot to schedule an appointment to have her boiler serviced before she expects to turn it on. Now the maintenance company is booked until late November. \u201cSo I screwed up there,\u201d she said.Neglect the chores entirely, though, and you could find yourself with a hefty repair bill or a furnace that peters out on a frigid January night \u2014 and probably in the middle of a three-day weekend, because isn\u2019t that when things usually go awry? Forget to clean the gutters, and ice could build up, damaging your roof. Drafty windows and doors could send your heating bill soaring.For first-time homeowners like Anthony and Melissa Campagna, who moved from an apartment in Long Island City, Queens, to a four-bedroom house in West Orange, N.J., in March, preparing for the first winter is a daunting task. What is a boiler, anyway? And what do you do with it other than crank up the thermostat?Buying a house \u201cwas very exciting, but somewhat overwhelming,\u201d said Mr. Campagna, 31, who works in finance. \u201cHaving lived in a condo association, I didn\u2019t have to take care of stuff much.\u201dStill, you need to know what to do \u2014 from the roof down to the basement, and out to the backyard. Here is how to get started.CHECK THE EXTERIORStart by giving the outside of your house a checkup. Walk around the perimeter and look for cracks in the siding or peeling paint. Are the windowsills in good condition? Check the roof for missing or broken tiles. Fix problems while the days are still relatively warm. After a rainstorm, walk around the house and look for any signs that water might not be draining properly, like pooling water or damaged gutters or downspouts.THE GUTTERS Of all the fall chores, cleaning the gutters and downspouts is among the most critical. Your gutters direct water away from your roof and siding, and down into the drainage system. Clogged gutters can cause your roof to leak and lead to ice dams in cold weather. So clean them or hire someone to do the job after the leaves fall. \u201cWhen the gutters aren\u2019t kept clean, the moisture just sits on the rooftop,\u201d said Dina Dwyer-Owens, a co-chair of the board of directors of the Dwyer Group, a parent company of home-repair franchises including Mr. Handyman and Mr. Rooter.Just don\u2019t do the work too soon. Clean the gutters before the last of the leaves fall, and you could find yourself back up on that ladder a few weeks later. \u201cI think I did it a little too early,\u201d said Mr. Campagna of West Orange, N.J., who rushed to clean his gutters before Mrs. Campagna, 30, gave birth to their first child in October. \u201cThat was a rookie mistake.\u201d And a wasted Saturday afternoon.THE WINDOWS AND DOORSIf you have window air-conditioning units, take them out and store them until next summer. But handle those unwieldy appliances with care to avoid injury.Or you could leave them in place. Ms. Levy of Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, covers the outside of her window units with an insulated sheath and wedges towels between the sill and the unit to keep drafts out.Next, swap out screens for storm doors and windows. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we automatically do when it starts getting cold out,\u201d Ms. Levy said. While you\u2019re changing out the screens for glass, check your windows and doors for drafts. Add weather stripping or caulk wherever cold air seeps in.SMOKE ALARMSTHE CHIMNEYHeat, smoke and dangerous gases from your fireplace and heating system travel up your chimney and out of your house, keeping the air inside breathable. A dirty chimney could affect air quality and also pose a fire hazard.THE HEATING SYSTEMIf you were going on a long road trip, you would get your car tuned up before you started your journey, not afterward. The same goes for your heating system. Call a plumber or a furnace repair company to prepare your boiler or furnace for winter before the cold weather arrives.THE PIPESNo one wants a frozen pipe, so keep an eye on yours. Drain the outside water faucets and shut them off before the first freeze. On very cold nights, open cabinets beneath the sink to let warm air in and, if you are especially worried about freezing pipes, let a slow drip of water run through them. Resist the urge to turn down the thermostat to save money \u2013 you want to keep the pipes warm. Extreme weather \u201cis not a time to start trying to save on your energy bill,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cCrank your heat up during those weeks.\u201dPUT THE GARDEN TO BED By November, you may not be thinking much about your hydrangeas, but they still need you. Prune your shrubs and hedges now. Cut foliage away from the house so that ice or snow on the branches won\u2019t damage your siding or let water into your home.THE PATIOEmpty ceramic pots of soil and store them in your garage or basement for the winter so they do not crack in freezing temperatures. Drain the hoses and store them, too. Shut down the sprinkler system and call the pool maintenance company to close up your pool, if you have one. But wait for a crisp sunny to day to cover patio furniture \u2014 you don\u2019t want to trap any moisture under the tarp.STOCK UP ON FIREWOODBRACE FOR WINTER WEATHERIf you have a snowblower, check it. You may need to have it serviced, and many local repair companies will pick up and drop off a blower as part of the service. \u201cStart it up, run it for a couple of minutes and make sure it\u2019s O.K.,\u201d said Rich Janow, 74, who has lived in a six-bedroom house in South Orange, N.J., for 32 years with his wife, Nancy Chiller Janow, 64. \u201cDo it now so that if you have a problem and you need the repair people to fix it, you have enough time before the really bad weather sets in.\u201dIf the winter is a snowy one, use a roof rake to remove excess snow from your roof, and stay on the lookout for ice dams, accumulations of ice and snow along your eaves that could damage your gutters, roof and siding.STAY ON TRACKSoon enough, it\u2019ll be time for spring cleanup.Advertisement"}

Micheal Martin, the leader of the opposition Fianna Fail, said an election \u201ccan be avoided\u201d if Mr. Varadkar fired his deputy, Frances Fitzgerald.Opposition leaders have questioned Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s role in a previous government that they accuse of failing to shield a whistle-blower who exposed police corruption.Ms. Fitzgerald could defuse the crisis herself by resigning. But she has shown no sign she will do so, and Mr. Varadkar\u2019s Fine Gael party has defended her strongly so far. Michael D\u2019Arcy, a finance minister, said Ms. Fitzgerald \u201ccannot resign and should not resign.\u201dHe told the news agency Reuters that a withdrawal of the no-confidence motion was the only way to defuse the crisis. T he motion is set to be debated by the Parliament in Dublin on Tuesday, possibly precipitating a snap election.\u201cI think we\u2019re heading for an election before Christmas,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Arcy said.An election campaign could influence how Mr. Varadkar approaches the summit meeting in December and whether he is seen by other European leaders as a weakened figure with few prospects of political survival.Some analysts suggested that he might use the meeting to drum up political support at home among Ireland\u2019s anti-Brexit voters by adopting a tough line against Britain.The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said his country \u201cdoes not need\u201d an election at this stage when there are \u201csome really, really serious issues for the government to manage in the national interest.\u201dHe also said on Thursday that the government wanted the British authorities to clarify their intentions on maintaining an open border with Northern Ireland. He said that was a prerequisite for Dublin to allow the broader Brexit discussions to move to trade talks.Apart from the Irish border arrangement, the European Union wants Britain to reach agreement on two other big issues: a financial settlement to leave the European Union, and legal protection for European Union citizens in Britain.Ed O\u2019Loughlin reported from Dublin, and Alan Cowell from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Campaign to Prevent Violent Traffic Stops Tells Drivers to Keep Cool", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShaquille O\u2019Neal wants to talk about traffic stops. So does a former New York Giants linebacker, as well as a bishop from Newark, police officers and a detective from local police departments, the president of the New Jersey chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., and the executive director of a local branch of the American Civil Liberties Union.This unusual alliance of celebrities, police officers and civil rights groups was prompted by a new campaign by the state attorney general, Christopher S. Porrino, that tells people how to conduct themselves during traffic stops as a means of defusing confrontations that have sometimes turned violent.While campaigns to educate citizens about their rights during police stops have become common across the country, the effort in New Jersey has already drawn criticism from some civil rights advocates, who maintain it conveys a subtle message that drivers and passengers bear responsibility for traffic stops that go awry.Mr. Porrino, a political independent who was nominated to serve as attorney general by Gov. Chris Christie in 2016, acknowledged that the campaign, which started this month, could prove controversial. While he said he did not believe the announcements placed too much of an onus on civilians, he welcomed the criticism as a way of keeping the dialogue going on the complicated relations between the police and the public.\u201cWe decided to take it on a bit, and maybe we\u2019ll take some heat from certain players, who think that we\u2019re blaming the victim, but this for me is practical, and less ideological,\u201d Mr. Porrino said in an interview. \u201cSo I\u2019m perfectly happy for people to, and I think they should, and I\u2019d encourage them to, continue the debate about police use of force.\u201dAs shootings of unarmed black men by the police have set off a national discussion on race relations and the way officers treat civilians, police departments across the country have struggled with how to make changes. Some departments, including in New Jersey, have adopted body cameras, required implicit-bias and de-escalation training for officers and held many meetings with local leaders.In developing the Safe Stop campaign, Mr. Porrino said that much of the reform effort in New Jersey had focused on law enforcement, but that little had been done to educate the public.\u201cI have the power to direct law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Porrino said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the power with respect to civilians, but I said to the team, \u2018Shouldn\u2019t we be thinking about ways to provide information that helps the other participants in every one of these encounters?\u2019\u201d A website that is part of the campaign allows people to file complaints against the police.\u201cThese ads perpetuate the false narrative that when citizens are harmed in police-citizen interactions that the responsibility to mitigate harm rests with the citizen,\u201d Mr. Mckesson said. \u201cPhilando Castile, for instance, did everything right and was still killed.\u201dThe ads also stop short of fully explaining the rights of a citizen in a traffic stop, according to Harlan Yu, the executive director of Upturn, a nonprofit that studies how technology affects social issues.\u201cOne thing that I think is missing from this is how somebody who does get stopped, where the officers are wearing body-worn cameras, how that person is able to get body-worn camera video,\u201d Mr. Yu said.That history made some participants in Safe Stop, particularly the A.C.L.U., initially hesitant to join the effort. And though the A.C.L.U. is a partner and has produced its own video, Amol Sinha, the executive director of the A.C.L.U. in New Jersey, said the group was monitoring to ensure that the attorney general\u2019s office shows \u201ca genuine interest towards transparency, accountability and oversight regarding the police.\u201dMr. Sinha said that \u201cwe believe that law enforcement bears ultimate responsibility, and we believe in police accountability.\u201d But, he added, \u201cit seems like the attorney general\u2019s office is genuinely thinking about those things constructively, so all of those things together helped us feel a little more comfortable with partnering.\u201dIn Camden, a city that was once plagued by violence, the police have been holding extensive discussions with residents in an effort to improve relations and foster better communication. The police chief, John S. Thomson, held a town-hall meeting after officers started wearing body cameras, and smaller meetings are held regularly.State officials have also made changes in law enforcement across New Jersey, including helping finance body cameras and providing training for officers.To some who have worked at cultivating better bonds between the police and the communities they patrol, the Safe Stop campaign is a positive step as part of broader law enforcement reforms.\u201cI don\u2019t view this as the magic wand that\u2019s going to fix everything, but as part of a comprehensive strategy, it\u2019s part of what makes sense,\u201d said Jim Johnson, a former Democratic candidate for governor who has focused extensively on police-community relations.\u201cYou have to ask yourself, what\u2019s the alternative?\u201d he added. \u201cIs the alternative not to provide people with info they can use? Not to provide people information that could decrease the likelihood of someone getting hurt in a police-community interaction? And I think the answer to that is no.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wind and Solar Power Advance, but Carbon Refuses to Retreat", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis statistic, alone, puts a big question mark over the strategies deployed around the world to replace fossil energy. In a nutshell: Perhaps renewables are not the answer.Still, except for very limited exceptions, all this wind and sun has not brought about much decarbonization. Indeed, it has not added much clean power to the grid.It is true that Germans would have made more progress in the battle against climate change had they kept their nuclear reactors running and shut plants burning lignite instead. Still, there are other reasons behind renewables\u2019 poor track record in decarbonizing electricity.Nuclear power faces hurdles beyond popular mistrust. Notably, reactors require a lot of capital up front. But renewables have a hard time producing power at a nuclear scale.Integrating renewable sources requires vast investments in electricity transmission \u2014 to move power from intermittently windy and sunny places to places where power is consumed. It requires maintaining a backstop of idle plants that burn fossil fuel, for the times when there is no wind or sun to be had. It requires investing in power-storage systems at a large scale.Another concern is that they will drive wholesale energy prices down too far. Because they produce the most energy when the sun is up and the wind is blowing, renewable generators can flood the grid at critical times of the day, slashing the price of power. This not only threatens the solvency of nuclear reactors, which cannot shut down on a dime and must therefore pay for the grid to accept their power, but also reduces the return on additional investment in renewables.The diplomats in Bonn may be tempted to wave away these concerns. Thomas Bruckner of the University of Leipzig argues that in the case of Germany, expanding renewables to supply 80 percent of power by 2050 is \u201cnot a significant burden.\u201d Heavy German investment in renewable energy technologies over the last decade succeeded in bringing prices down, he contends; it will be much cheaper to go the rest of the way.Two years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, the world remains far off course from preventing drastic global warming in the decades ahead.Perhaps. But there is some evidence that among investors, at least, the excitement may be waning. After half a decade of sustained increases, investment in solar and wind energy has been fairly flat since 2010, at around $250 billion per year. While that is a lot of money, it is nowhere near enough.\u201cWe will need twice as much investment over a sustained period of time to get anywhere close to achieving 2 degrees,\u201d said Ethan Zindler, head of Bloomberg New Energy Finance in the Americas, referring to the objective of the world\u2019s climate diplomats: keep the average world temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above its average in the late 19th century.I would suggest that the challenge is not just to raise more money. Building a zero-carbon energy system requires broader thinking about the technological mix.An earlier version of this column included an outdated affiliation for Lion Hirth, who conducted a study on the value of wind power.

{"Headline": "Republicans May Use Cuts in Entitlement Programs to Reduce Deficit", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican lawmakers have largely dismissed concerns about how their $1.5 trillion tax cut would add to the federal deficit. Now, some Democrats are warning that the tax rewrite would ultimately be financed by gutting entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.The possibility of cuts to safety net programs appeared more likely on Tuesday, as the Congressional Budget Office warned that the tax bill could set off an arcane budget rule that would make deep cuts to Medicare over the next decade.Republican lawmakers have turned a blind eye to the effect of the tax bill on the deficit, saying the tax cuts would essentially pay for themselves through increased economic growth.But the party of deficit hawks is beginning to once again complain about the ballooning federal deficit, suggesting that spending cuts must be enforced to reduce the national debt, which has surpassed $20 trillion.At a town hall-style event in Virginia on Tuesday night, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, said the most important steps that could be taken to reduce the national debt were spurring economic growth and making changes to entitlement programs.\u201cYou cannot get the national debt under control, you cannot get that deficit under control, if you don\u2019t do both: grow the economy, cut spending,\u201d said Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.The Republican tax plan, he said \u201cgrows the economy. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in cutting spending.\u201dDemocrats said the tax bill was opening the door to the kind of entitlement cuts that Republicans had long wanted to pursue.\u201cThis is a nasty, two-step strategy that has long been the holy grail for hard-right Republicans,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader. \u201cIf this bill passes, you can bet the Republicans will immediately sharpen the knives for middle-class benefits.\u201dThe Congressional Budget Office said on Tuesday that a law passed in 2010 would necessitate cuts to Medicare of as much as $25 billion next year. The pay-as-you-go law requires that legislation that adds to the federal deficit be paid for with spending cuts or other offsets. If that does not happen, automatic cuts to programs like Medicare kick in. The Medicare cuts, which are capped at 4 percent of the program\u2019s annual spending, could reach almost a half trillion dollars over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The cuts can be averted through bipartisan legislation, though it is unclear whether Republicans would go along with such workarounds.\u201cI can\u2019t believe how quickly the deficit hawks in the Republican Party flew away after they saw the $1.5 trillion,\u201d Mr. Wyden said of the lost revenues that Republicans have approved in their tax plan. \u201cWe\u2019re sure that they will start making their way back when we see the deficits.\u201dFiscal conservatives in the House and the Senate have long wanted to rein in spending on such programs but have had to temper those desires this year now that President Trump, who promised as a candidate not to touch entitlement programs, is in office.But Mr. Trump showed some flexibility on the matter this year when he supported a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act that would have cut Medicaid funding. And in recent weeks, Republican leaders have quietly started to indicate that if they succeed in passing tax cuts, they will, in fact, look to overhaul government welfare programs.The dozens of changes in the legislation would add more than $1.4 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said this month that tax overhaul \u201calone won\u2019t get us back to a balanced budget.\u201d He said that House Republicans would soon turn toward \u201cwelfare reform and tackling the entitlements.\u201dSome Republican senators have also expressed interest in turning to spending cuts afterward.\u201cYes, we waste an enormous amount of money in the federal budget,\u201d said Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho. He said that government personnel should be cut along with Medicare and Social Security.Top White House officials have also suggested that the administration is willing to get on board with entitlement changes. In an interview with CNBC last week, Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, said that the president was focused on taxes, deregulation and infrastructure and that changes to safety net programs would follow.\u201cI think when he gets done with those, I think welfare is going to come up,\u201d Mr. Cohn said.If Republicans pass their tax bill and their optimistic projections about economic growth do not come to pass, they will face pressure to address the deficit and cut spending.Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that he was concerned about the effect of the tax bill on deficits and that it added to the urgency to scale back programs like Medicare.\u201cTax reform is looking like it will make our long-term debt more problematic, and the long-term driver of our debt is increases in entitlement spending,\u201d said Mr. Strain, who argued that it was a better use of resources to cut corporate taxes than to increase funding for entitlements.If Republicans decide to try to circumvent the pay-as-you-go rule, it could be taken as a sign that they are not serious about deficit reduction. For Democrats, it could be enticing to show the public the consequences of Republican-driven tax cuts, but it would be difficult for them to essentially support cuts to a government program that provides health insurance for the elderly.\u201cAt the end of the day, it is somewhat akin to the debt limit that no one actually wants to let it happen,\u201d said Ed Lorenzen, a senior adviser for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, who noted that spending would eventually have to be addressed if Republicans used the deficit to finance tax cuts.For now, Republicans are playing down the likelihood that Medicare cuts will come to pass.\u201cNo such thing is going to be triggered automatically,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Toxic Mix: Sex, Religion and Hypocrisy", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 If you thought it was challenging for women to come forward and accuse Harvey Weinstein of rape, consider accusing the Islamic theologist Tariq Ramadan. Emboldened by the enormous response in France to the #MeToo wave that was born in Hollywood, two Frenchwomen decided last month to sue Mr. Ramadan for rape and sexual abuse. One of the women, Henda Ayari, has gone public. The second has described her ordeal to journalists but has remained anonymous. And for good reason: Henda Ayari has had to appeal for help after becoming the target of a vicious campaign of insults and slander on social networks, mostly from Muslim extremists. Mr. Ramadan, a grandson of the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, denies the accusations.It is not only that the Swiss-born Mr. Ramadan, 55, who has taken a leave of absence from Oxford University, where he has taught contemporary Islamic studies (a chair financed by Qatar), is a prominent figure on the intellectual and religious Islamic scene in France. What makes his accusers particularly brave is that they, like him, are practicing Muslims. By the very fact of having spent time alone with him, they have, in the eyes of rigorist teachings of Islam, violated the rules of modesty that women are required to follow.The sexual revolution that liberated Western women in the 20th century has yet to occur in most of the Muslim world. But we may be seeing a beginning, six years after the crushed hopes of the Arab revolutions. In North Africa, at least, and in the Arabic communities within France, the seeds of women\u2019s rebellion are bearing fruit slowly. Tunisia, the one Arab country that did not turn its back on the Arab Spring, is breaking barriers.\u201cIn Arabic, revolution means whirlwind,\u201d the Tunisian film director Kaouther Ben Hania, a woman, recently told the French public radio channel France-Inter. \u201cSo it turns everything upside down, it changes everything, and overnight we find ourselves talking about everything, while under the dictatorship we did not talk. I would never have been able to do this movie before the revolution.\u201dJust released in France and in her country, Ms. Ben Hania\u2019s movie \u201cThe Beauty and the Dogs\u201d is a harrowing tale of a 20-year-old student raped by two policemen in Tunis after being caught walking on a beach with a boyfriend at night. The film concentrates on the night that follows, during which Mariam, the student, tries stubbornly to file a complaint, which would require getting a doctor to examine her and policemen to take her testimony. Gradually, as hours pass and she encounters more obstacles, her violated dignity leads to a political awakening. Threatened with arrest at dawn, she does not give in. In the end, Ms. Ben Hania explains, \u201cit is the policemen who are afraid of her. Fear has changed sides.\u201dMs. Ben Hania, 40, is one of several Arab women now raising their voices in North Africa and in France. The New Year\u2019s Eve attacks by mostly Arab migrants on German women in Cologne in 2016 shed light on what the Algerian author and columnist Kamel Daoud described as \u201cthe sexual misery of the Arab world.\u201d His scathing text, published in Le Monde and The New York Times, shocked a group of French academics, who accused him of indulging in \u201cOrientalist clich\u00e9s.\u201d But when the video of a young woman sexually assaulted by a group of teenagers on a bus in Casablanca, Morocco, went viral this summer, those academics kept silent.Neither did they utter a word when the Moroccan actress Loubna Abidar had to take refuge in France last year after receiving death threats for her role in \u201cMuch Loved,\u201d a Franco-Moroccan film about prostitutes that was banned in Morocco.As more women emerge, in France, Switzerland and Belgium, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Ramadan, a picture emerges of the domination exercised over women by a powerful Islamic theologian who had also impressed some left-wing French intellectuals and television hosts. It is a picture of a double life that those who had scrutinized him had long suspected. The French feminist writer Caroline Fourest, his archenemy, says she had been approached by some of his victims but was not able to persuade them to file complaints.Bernard Godard, a former official of the Ministry of Interior, where he was for many years the main expert on Islam before retiring three years ago, even told the French magazine L\u2019Obs last week that he had heard that Tariq Ramadan had \u201cmistresses, that he consulted sites, that girls were brought to the hotel at the end of his lectures, that he invited some to undress, that some resisted and that he could become violent and aggressive.\u201d But he admitted to being \u201cstunned\u201d by the latest allegations, of rapes. \u201cI have never heard of rapes,\u201d he said.Double life is a familiar theme, as is sexual misery, in a very revealing book just published in France, \u201cSexe et Mensonges: La Vie Sexuelle au Maroc\u201d (\u201cSex and Lies: Sex Life in Morocco\u201d), by the Franco-Moroccan novelist Le\u00efla Slimani. A celebrated author in France, Ms. Slimani, 36, took advantage of a book tour in Morocco to interview all sorts of women about sex, men, family, women, religion and dress codes.The world they describe is a world of hypocrisy, where appearance and reality clash constantly, where sex is a source of shame but on everybody\u2019s mind, where the cult of virginity \u2014 demanded only of women \u2014 leads veiled girls to favor sodomy and oral sex to keep their hymen intact or to pay for hymen reparation before getting married. They tell Ms. Slimani of a schizophrenic society, torn between submission and transgression, where the law prohibits sex outside marriage but where everybody does it \u2014 in hiding. They feel sorry for mothers who had to give up a school they loved to marry a man they did not choose. They are sick of the chaos that mass consumption of pornography on the internet adds to teenagers\u2019 confused view of sexuality.Women are on the front line of this indispensable revolution, because they are the first victims of Islamic obscurantists. Ironically, this world of religious dogmas about sexuality was once a very different world. Ten centuries ago, Arabic erotica written by religious dignitaries and sophisticated dictionaries of sex shocked the West. Six decades ago, women wore miniskirts in Kabul and in Tunis.Today, they just want to decide freely who they are, what they wear, whom they love and when. Make no mistake. In the environment they live in, that is a highly political demand.Sylvie Kauffmann is the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Facebook said an estimated 150 million users of its main site and its subsidiary, Instagram, were exposed to the posts, a larger figure than it provided even as recently as Monday.During the last of the three hearings, members of the House Intelligence Committee spoke in front of posters displaying the content, complaining that it was divisive.Representative Andr\u00e9 Carson, Democrat of Indiana, said an account called Being Patriotic, which amassed 200,000 followers, pushed out content that \u201ccynically exploits grieving officers and their loved ones in order to pit Americans concerned about our law enforcement personnel against Americans concerned about African-American lives lost during police encounters.\u201dThe account was created by the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency.\u201cMy concern is that a dictator like Vladimir Putin abused flaws in our social media platforms to inject the worst kind of identity politics into the voting decisions of at least 100 million Americans,\u201d Mr. Carson said, referring to the Russian president.Ms. Sewell cited figures showing few blacks in Facebook\u2019s work force and its leadership \u2014 a lack of diversity that she said made it hard to believe that those reviewing socially divisive ads could spot problematic posts.While the lawyers showed humility and promised to beef up security and improve technology to prevent foreign interference in elections, they admitted they could not guarantee they would prevent future intrusions. Google\u2019s general counsel, Kent Walker, said the company would work on creating new technologies to detect foreign actors and misinformation on its site. All three said they would build artificial intelligence tools to combat fake and problematic content.\u201cA lot of folks, including many in the media, have tried to reduce this entire conversation down to one premise: Foreign actors conducted a surgically executed covert operation to help elect a United States president,\u201d said Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, emphasized that the real intent of Russian propaganda was to broadly spread misinformation and create chaos.\u201cThese operations \u2014 while we\u2019re talking about the 2016 presidential race \u2014 they\u2019re not limited to 2016, and they were not limited to the presidential race, and they continue to this day,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are much more widespread than one election.\u201dBut the difference in their emphasis on Wednesday also underscored the political realities buffeting their work. In advancing an investigation tied to Mr. Trump, Mr. Burr has been careful to make clear that the committee\u2019s work is larger than an individual candidate, and he has repeatedly tried to tamp down expectations about what it might find.Democrats did not have such reticence.\u201cWhether the Russians and the campaign coordinated these efforts, we do not yet know, but it is true that the Russians mounted what could be described as an independent expenditure campaign on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, also took aim at Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissal of the role of Russia-linked social media in his win. Mr. Heinrich challenged Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, to acknowledge such content and the role that fake accounts linked to Russia and other misinformation had in the election.Mr. Stretch said no. \u201cThe existence of those ads were on Facebook,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was not a hoax.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

The fund has so far secured $10.3 billion in financing.To be sure, the climate fund has also enjoyed some notable successes, including private projects. The off-grid solar projects in Rwanda and Kenya, for example, have been praised for their focus on reaching remote communities.Critically, the early mix of approvals has meant that less than a tenth of the funding has gone to the kind of projects that make up the fund\u2019s mandate: those owned and controlled by the poorer nations themselves.The fund\u2019s growing pains reflect the competing pressures \u2014 from its donors, from the private sector, and from the countries it is meant to assist. Eager to show taxpayers back home that the fund is being put to work, donor countries have put pressure on the fund to ramp up its disbursements. Similar pressures arise from bank\u2019s need to raise private investment to make up for the expected shortfall in contributions from industrialized countries.The fund\u2019s secretariat did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But in response to some of these criticisms, the bank has adopted a monitoring framework meant to strengthen transparency at the fund. The fund also recently set up an independent evaluation unit to assess the effectiveness of its projects.For places like Kiribati, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Much of the country, a string of atolls and reef islands that straddles the Equator, lies no higher than six feet above sea level. The prospect of rising seas and more extreme storms threatens \u201cthe very existence\u201d of large segments of the population, the government has said.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Officials in Kiribati have said they desperately need funding for desalination plants to provide safe water for the 110,000 residents of country, where much of the water has become contaminated by seawater intrusion into groundwater. The government is also seeking to elevate land on its main atoll and invest in renewable energy to end the country\u2019s almost complete reliance on fossil fuels.But with little diplomatic and financial heft, officials have struggled to secure funding.The fund has pledged to improve the quality of its projects. It is also working to improve access for countries applying for smaller projects of less than $10 million.\u201cBut we just started. There are competing interests \u2014 from countries, from the private sector, and we are trying to wade through this maze of conflicting interests,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will get there.\u201dKiribati scored a small victory this year when it qualified for a $586,000 grant to help the country prepare a new application to the fund.The island nation, however, has also taken some heart-wrenching measures.In 2014, Kiribati bought 8 square miles of land in Fiji, more than a thousand miles away, as an insurance policy against the rising oceans.Mr. Mamau stressed that migration from Kiribati would be an absolute last resort.\u201cThe idea is to build Kiribati\u2019s resilience,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that Kiribati will sink like the Titanic.\u201dFollow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Finance Minister Says He\u2019ll Run for President", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s finance minister, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, stepped down Monday and announced his intention to run for president in next year\u2019s election, assuming the coveted candidacy of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.In recent months, speculation has been rampant about whom the president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and his party would select as the party\u2019s candidate.The president, who is limited to a single term of six years, has received some of the lowest approval ratings in the country\u2019s recent history amid corruption scandals, record-breaking violence and a sluggish economy \u2014 making the selection of a candidate to succeed him a delicate matter.Mr. Meade, 48, holds a doctorate in economics from Yale and is seen as a capable technocrat with a wide range of experience. He has held several cabinet-level positions in rival administrations, making him an attractive selection for the governing party, also known as the PRI, which wanted someone with a clean record.Under Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Mr. Meade oversaw the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Social Development Ministry. He also served under Felipe Calder\u00f3n, who preceded Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and was a member of the opposition National Action Party, or PAN, as both energy minister and finance minister.Mr. Meade is, in the eyes of most analysts, the safest bet for the party, which governed Mexico for some 70 years until 2000 and struggles with a reputation for corruption and for wielding a heavy hand when in power. He was not dogged by scandal or controversy during any of the administrations he served in, unlike some of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s other cabinet members.\u201cWe are talking about someone who is highly efficient in managing high-level bureaucracy, enjoys a good public image and has a steady dialogue with both the opposition conservative PAN party and the PRI, without being a militant of either,\u201d said Fernando Dworak, a political analyst.Mr. Meade has kept a low profile and is not officially affiliated with any political party. He has never run for public office, and his speeches are highly technical and, to some, highly boring.A big question for the candidate will be whether his stellar credentials and scandal-free record will be enough to overcome his relatively low-energy demeanor.Although Mr. Meade is not the most popular possible candidate among the party\u2019s base, analysts say, party officials hope he will ultimately attract voters from the PAN, which could help fend off the party\u2019s left-wing rival, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a top contender, who represents a third party.The decision by the PRI to put forth a candidate with a clean public record and credibility in the business community comes at a moment of increasing dissatisfaction and distrust with political leaders in Mexico.\u201cIt is yet another piece of evidence of the PRI\u2019s profound credibility crisis, so much that they had to turn to someone who is not even affiliated and yet will help calm down the markets, while guaranteeing the survival of the establishment,\u201d said Genaro Lozano a professor at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City.Still, having served the entire term under the current administration, Mr. Meade cannot entirely escape scrutiny. His critics accuse him of being opportunistic and accuse him of having taken part in covering up alleged fraud and the diversion of public funds during Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s administration.The announcement came only a day after the next most probable candidate, Secretary of Interior Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, was reported to have stepped aside from the presidential race despite leading in the polls.On Monday, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto publicly expressed his regard for Mr. Meade, praising his \u201coutstanding\u201d performance as the head of three different government agencies during his administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Pistons\u2019 New Home, Empty Seats and Hockey Statues", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 After you have spent a very pleasant evening in a shiny new sports arena in a spruced-up neighborhood in a once-decaying city, it feels unduly meanspirited to mention that the place feels kind of empty.But that has been the vexing situation lately in Detroit, where the enormous fanfare that greeted the opening of the Little Caesars Arena in September has been followed by a succession of not-so-enormous basketball crowds.People have different explanations, starting with the fact that the Pistons have not been the world\u2019s most thrilling team in recent years.\u201cIt\u2019s the Pistons, man \u2014 they never win,\u201d said Daniel Bronston, 29, a cook who was at a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves late last month. (He was exaggerating. The team is 9-3, and it handily beat Minnesota that evening, 122-101. But it is fair to say that the Pistons\u2019 performance in recent years has been anemic.)Then there is the area itself. Stan Van Gundy, the Pistons\u2019 coach, said that Little Caesars and the surrounding neighborhood were too full of distractingly fun stuff to do, so that fans would be lured into wandering outside and would not return to their seats to watch the game.For almost 30 years, the Pistons played at The Palace at Auburn Hills, in a Detroit suburb that hosted the franchise\u2019s Bad Boys-era title teams of 1989 and \u201990 and also its less pugnacious championship squad of 2004.Suburban fans who came to the game against the Timberwolves last month said they were having to adjust not only to the new location \u2014 a hard thing for fans who like old routines \u2014 but also to the new breed of visitors.\u201cTen years ago, nobody wanted to live downtown, and now everybody does, especially young professionals and \u2018hipsters,\u2019 as they call them,\u201d said Dustin Kosnik, 26, an engineer in the auto industry. \u201cHipsters want to do everything before it\u2019s cool.\u201dAs far as the Pistons\u2019 management is concerned, the arena is extremely cool. Built by Olympia Development, part of the Ilitch family empire, it cost $862.9 million, $324 million of it in public financing. It has brought new life to a once-neglected area of Detroit, with retail shops, upmarket restaurants and handsome new or recently renovated housing.But if Cleveland fans could get used to showing up at Quicken Loans Arena, where the Cavaliers play, then surely Detroit fans can cope with a gym named after a pizza conglomerate, even one that fails to use an essential apostrophe in its title. \u201cWelcome to Little Caesars Arena, the newest, most exciting arena in the world!\u201d blared a loudspeaker from the side of the building as fans arrived for a recent game.Charlie Metzger, the Pistons\u2019 chief revenue and marketing officer, said the team was pleased with how things had gone so far. More than 80 percent of last year\u2019s season-ticket holders came back, he said, and the team added 3,000 new ones.\u201cThere\u2019s an adjustment period,\u201d he said, \u201cbut overall the reaction we\u2019ve gotten has been very, very positive. In addition to its being a brand-new building, the excitement is in being part of what\u2019s happening in the city.\u201dSure, there are fans who feel aggrieved about what they see as a hockey-centric atmosphere, reflected in the steeply graded seats and in what seems to be a disproportionate array of Red Wings memorabilia scattered about the ground-floor concourse. The arena is full of statues of hockey players like Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay, while famous Pistons like Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars have to settle mostly for appearing in photographs suspended from the ceiling.The thought is not lost on the players, either. Little Caesars looks \u201cmore like a hockey arena,\u201d the Pistons\u2019 star center, Andre Drummond, tweeted in September.Metzger said the memorabilia display was a work in progress. \u201cWe\u2019re working closely in partnership with the Wings to make sure that both teams are properly represented,\u201d he said.The point guard Reggie Jackson said he was not thrilled about playing with ice under the floor, a state of affairs that Little Caesars, of course, shares with many other combination arenas.At the Timberwolves game, the mood was gently benign rather than raucously enthusiastic. The arena did its best to stir the fans\u2019 passions, such as they were. Music blasted out across the crowd. \u201cWE FEEL YOUR EXCITEMENT,\u201d said the Jumbotron, a sentiment that under the circumstances felt more aspirational than descriptive. Although the Pistons dominated the game, the crowd seemed to respond most vociferously when workers roamed the stands dispensing giant Michigan state lottery cards.But it\u2019s hard not to love Little Caesars, which fits so seamlessly into its city.\u201cBefore, this was a no-go area, full of derelict land and abandoned buildings,\u201d said Craig Hepworth, who was on a brief return visit to Detroit after moving to Florida in search of the sun. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be able to stay downtown and do stuff instead of just getting in your car and driving away right after a game.\u201cIf Detroit gets any nicer,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019ll have to move back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Jersey\u2019s Next Governor: A Rich Donor With Progressive Roots", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "Man in the NewsBefore Philip D. Murphy was a governor, he was a Goldman Sachs executive. And before that, he was raised in a home that revered the Kennedys.Supported byASBURY PARK, N.J. \u2014 Philip Dunton Murphy bounded onto the stage here in early November amid rapturous cheers, though they were not all for him. His good friend, Jon Bon Jovi, had just blitzed through a three-song set, mixed with a brief endorsement of Mr. Murphy spoken over the chords of \u201cWho Says You Can\u2019t Go Home.\u201dFor Mr. Murphy, it was a note-perfect moment: irrefutable testimony of his New Jersey bona fides and of his progressive, working-class roots from a native son revered as a balladeer of the New Jersey working stiff.But over more than 500 days of relentless campaigning, such moments did not always come easily or naturally for Mr. Murphy, whose setting for much of his professional life has been rarefied corporate boardrooms and ornate European salons rather than rowdy campaign scenes.With his election, Mr. Murphy becomes the first Democrat to occupy the governor\u2019s office in eight years, further cementing New Jersey\u2019s shift to a decidedly blue state and giving a man who spent years on the periphery as an influential financial contributor his first chance at the political spotlight. He takes over a state where many are disillusioned and angry at the way the outgoing Republican governor, Chris Christie, has left New Jersey, riddled with debt, schools bereft of funding, exorbitant property taxes and a dismal public transit system.Mr. Murphy, 60, grew up in a modest Irish home in Newton, Mass., raised on Catholic values of social justice that were reinforced with trips to church every Sunday. Part of a family of four, he occasionally had to share a bedroom, and he got his first job washing dishes when he was 13. His family revered the Kennedys \u2014 any speech by John F. Kennedy or Robert F. Kennedy was cause to huddle around the television.Though he never ran for student government in grade school or high school, politics were a constant in his early life, from dinner table discussions to time spent with his grandfather \u2014 \u201cHonest John\u201d \u2014 the chairman of the Newton Board of Assessors.\u201cI think there\u2019s a continual thread of progressive Democratic principles that the family always stood by,\u201d his sister, Dorothy Murphy Egan, 70, recalled. \u201cI think that\u2019s the absolute truth.\u201dMr. Murphy\u2019s father never graduated from high school, and throughout his childhood his mother stressed the need for a good education. Despite his family\u2019s love of politics, Mr. Murphy felt a stronger pull toward the stage during college. At Harvard, he quickly rose to become president of the Hasty Pudding Club, a famed theatrical club where he shared sketches and dance numbers with two future politicians, Charlie Baker, the current Republican governor of Massachusetts, and Deval Patrick, a former Democratic governor.His love for showmanship would blend into his professional life \u2014 from performing karaoke with Goldman Sachs colleagues to singing \u201cTouch Me\u2019\u2019 by The Doors at a recent campaign rally \u2014 but rather than pursue a career in theater, Mr. Murphy opted for the more lucrative world of finance, where he amassed a personal fortune during a more than 20-year career at Goldman Sachs.It was during his time at Goldman that he met his wife, Tammy. They had known each other through shared social circles for years. But after a whirlwind first date in London, they were engaged just 18 days later. They now have four children, three boys and one girl, and live in a $9.5 million home in Red Bank, near the Jersey Shore.After stints as head of Goldman Sachs Germany and Goldman Sachs Asia that were considered largely successful, Mr. Murphy moved with his wife to New Jersey in 2000. They immediately took an interest in the local political scene, nurturing and financially supporting candidates who aligned with their center-left positions, leading them to a rising political star in Essex County: Cory Booker.\u201cIt was sometime in 2002 where he really just came to my aid,\u201d Mr. Booker said in an interview. Mr. Booker had just lost his upstart bid to unseat the mayor of Newark, Sharpe James, a powerful incumbent hampered by controversy, and the defeat, combined with a documentary that was made about the rough-and-tumble race, led him to question whether politics was for him. He spent time at the Murphys\u2019 home, licking his wounds while they tried to buoy his spirits.\u201cHe was one of those guys who just really encouraged me at that time to just not give up,\u201d Mr. Booker said.In those years, with Mr. Murphy having to devote time and energy to his responsibilities at Goldman, he largely kept to the political sidelines. It was not until Gov. Richard Codey, a Democrat, tapped him in 2005 to tackle the state\u2019s growing property tax crisis that Mr. Murphy felt the first pangs to run for office himself.He spent six months on the project as chairman of a state commission, eventually delivering a scathing report on the state\u2019s finances and pension system and lofty goals for addressing the problems.\u201cI think that was a moment that really hurt him, because I think he felt like he had expended a lot of personal capital trying to help to come up with some solutions, and I think he felt like he had come up with some solutions,\u201d Ms. Murphy recalled. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said this, but I would go back to that moment and say that I think that was the real moment where he basically said, \u2018You know what? You have to have skin in the game.\u2019\u201dHe quickly moved through the ranks of the Democratic Party, from a deep-pocketed donor to finance chair for the Democratic National Committee, where he faced an existential crisis: trying to heal the rift in 2008 between supporters of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton following a bruising primary campaign, one that left many Clinton donors wounded ahead of a challenging general election battle against John McCain.\u201cThere was one dinner in Miami, and it was quite contentious,\u201d recalled Tom McMahon, the former executive director of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe Hillary donors felt like we, the D.N.C., had put our thumb on the scale for Barack Obama. Phil interjected himself, recalibrated and answered the two or three points that this donor was hammering me on.\u201dMr. Murphy managed to loosen the donor\u2019s wallet. \u201cHe may have gotten a check that week,\u201d Mr. McMahon said.Though Mr. Murphy may have harbored aspirations for public office, they went unnoticed by his Democratic Party colleagues.\u201cIf you would have told me 10 years ago that Phil would one day run for office, I would have been surprised,\u201d Mr. McMahon said. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a lot of individuals who identify as politicians. Phil has not fit that role as the stereotype of the people who are constantly trying to be self-seekers.\u201dInstead, Mr. Murphy\u2019s performance as the party\u2019s finance chair turned into an appointment by President Obama as the German ambassador, where he weathered a modest scandal triggered by leaks of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks in which Mr. Murphy offered unflattering descriptions of German politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel.After four years in Germany, Mr. Murphy returned home to New Jersey in 2013, at a time when Mr. Christie was one of the most popular governors in the country.But he and his wife saw an opening \u2014 an increasingly stagnant state economy \u2014 that they might seize on to build an outside shot at a campaign.And indeed, from the very beginning, before any candidate had officially announced, Mr. Murphy was considered a long-shot, who would struggle to find a path to the nomination against better-known and established Democrats, like Steven Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City, and Stephen M. Sweeney, the State Senate president. But after some deft political maneuvering that yielded key endorsements and large checks written to county Democratic committees, the Murphy campaign was able to force Mr. Fulop out of the race, and, by uniting Democrats in northern New Jersey, left Mr. Sweeney, who is based in the southern part of the state, no clear path to victory.From that moment, the election became Mr. Murphy\u2019s to lose. He then had to energize an electorate dejected and exhausted by President Trump\u2019s stunning victory last November and a Democratic Party still struggling to find direction.His speeches rarely contained any detailed discussions of policy. Instead, they were largely proclamations and promises designed to rally a base hungry for a victory that would provide solace amid so much rancor over the policies and words emanating from the White House.Eager to please, he ran a campaign marked by an extended list of promises \u2014 to organized labor, to progressive party activists, to environmentalists, to immigrants, to disenchanted Democrats, to the poor, to commuters.And as governor, Mr. Murphy may find that his desire to be well-liked and attuned to the needs of his many disparate constituencies runs counter to the difficult decisions he will need to make as chief executive in a state that has largely been left out of the economic recovery.But even while he struggled to energize voters, Mr. Murphy heads to Trenton with a characteristic that friends, colleagues and relatives tend to cite first in describing him \u2014 boundless energy.For now, Mr. Murphy seems to relish his opportunity to step onto a big stage.\u201cI saw him down for St. Patrick\u2019s Day in Belmar, and he was thoroughly enjoying himself,\u201d said James E. McGreevey, a former Democratic governor. \u201cYou don\u2019t have six hundred people drinking Harp at Goldman Sachs every week.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the political party for Gov. Charlie Baker. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Commerce Secretary\u2019s Offshore Ties to Putin \u2018Cronies\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "The Paradise PapersWilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, retained investments in a shipping firm with business ties to Russian President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle.Supported byAfter becoming commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross Jr. retained investments in a shipping firm he once controlled that has significant business ties to a Russian oligarch subject to American sanctions and President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s son-in-law, according to newly disclosed documents.In addition to Mr. Ross, the files contain references to other members of the Trump administration, including Gary D. Cohn, the chief economic adviser who was associated with 22 Bermuda entities while an executive at Goldman Sachs, and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who was a director of a Bermuda-based joint venture with the government of Yemen when he ran Exxon Mobil\u2019s operations there. There is no evidence of illegality in any of their dealings.Mr. Ross emerges as a particularly valued client for the offshore law firm, whose records provide more insight into his financial holdings beyond the public ethics disclosures he made upon joining the Trump administration. His ethics agreement filed in January listed the partnerships he intended to keep, but not the investments they held. Previously, Navigator had been mentioned in a separate, 57-page description of his holdings for the year that ended in December 2016, but with no hint of its ties to Sibur.In a written response to questions by the Times, James Rockas, a spokesman for Mr. Ross, said that Navigator\u2019s relationship with Sibur began before Mr. Ross joined the board in March 2012, and that he had never met the Russian oligarchs who are Sibur\u2019s major shareholders. Public records show that Mr. Ross\u2019s firm became a major investor in Navigator in November 2011, three months before the company chartered its first ships to Sibur.\u201cSibur was not under sanctions at the time the contract was signed and is still not subject to sanctions,\u201d Mr. Rockas said.More broadly, he said that Mr. Ross \u201crecuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels, but has been generally supportive of the administration\u2019s sanctions of Russian and Venezuelan entities.\u201d\u201cSecretary Ross has never had to seek, nor received, any ethics exemption,\u201d Mr. Rockas said, \u201cand he works closely with Commerce Department ethics officials to ensure the highest ethical standards.\u201dIn the wake of reports of Russian interference in the United States presidential election, multiple investigations have explored potential business ties between Russia and members of the Trump administration. While several Trump campaign and business associates have come under scrutiny, until now no business connections have been reported between senior administration officials and members of Mr. Putin\u2019s family or inner circle.During Mr. Ross\u2019s confirmation process, he was asked repeatedly about his business ties to Russia, mostly related to his former role as vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, where he dealt with Russian investors but also forced some of them out of the bank. He was also asked about his investment in another shipping company, Diamond S, and whether its dealings with China could pose a conflict with his government duties. But he faced no questions about Navigator and its significant financial relationship with Sibur.Mr. Rockas did not respond to questions about the current status of Mr. Ross\u2019s investment. If Mr. Ross stands to benefit, albeit indirectly, from a Russian firm controlled by members of Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle, it poses a potential conflict with his role as the lead cabinet member on trade policy, ethics experts said. Richard W. Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush White House and has emerged as a frequent critic of the Trump administration, said that while Mr. Ross\u2019s continued investment in Navigator would not violate any laws, it created other ethical concerns.\u201cApart from those legal issues,\u201d Mr. Painter said, \u201cI\u2019d be very concerned that someone in the U.S. government was making money from dealing with the Russians.\u201dAs for Navigator, its leadership sees blue skies ahead with one of its key investors now at the helm of American trade policy.On Nov. 30 of last year, hours after being nominated as commerce secretary, Mr. Ross celebrated at Gramercy Tavern, an upscale Manhattan restaurant, at an event hosted by Navigator. He and David J. Butters, Navigator\u2019s chief executive, arrived early to a private room and had a chat.Mr. Ross\u2019s foray into transoceanic shipping took off in 2011, when his private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., assembled teams of investors to acquire major stakes in Diamond S Shipping and Navigator Holdings. Both firms specialized in chartering tankers to petroleum companies that need to move gas, oil and petrochemicals around the world. With Mr. Ross\u2019s involvement, they would expand their business interests in China and Russia.Over a lengthy investment career that included a stint running the bankruptcy advisory practice at the British banking firm Rothschild, he has breathed new life into textile, steel and auto-part businesses. While at Rothschild in the early 1990s, he led a group of bondholders in a restructuring of the floundering Trump casinos in Atlantic City, preserving a stake for Mr. Trump because, as he reportedly assured disgruntled investors, the Trump name was \u201cstill very much an asset.\u201dIn the statement to The Times, Mr. Ross\u2019s spokesman said, \u201cPrivate equity firms have a responsibility to their investors to optimize corporate structures, and Secretary Ross has decades of experience that he is now using to benefit American workers.\u201dAs worldwide shipping concerns, Diamond S and Navigator did not have much of a labor footprint in the United States when Mr. Ross and his investors took over. But the way both companies did business would pose potential conflicts with American interests in other ways.Alongside Mr. Ross, another large investor in Diamond S was a company controlled by the Chinese government, according to securities filings. And Navigator signed a charter agreement with Sibur shortly after Mr. Ross\u2019s firm made its investment. Sibur said in a statement that any negotiations with Navigator over the years were carried out by its executives, not its major shareholders, and that \u201cno meetings were held with Mr. Ross.\u201dInitially, Navigator chartered two vessels to Sibur, and later increased the fleet to four. The relationship proved to be so profitable that Navigator\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Butters, told investors in a 2016 conference call how Navigator benefited as Sibur beat out American competitors in the growing European energy market.\u201cRussia is pipelining as much natural gas as needed into Europe, and liquids are being shipped into all areas of the continent in increasing amounts, all in competition with longer-haul U.S. exports,\u201d Mr. Butters said.As one of the largest gas companies in Russia, Sibur is not just any private business.Then, in September 2014, as sanctions pressure was growing, Mr. Timchenko reduced his holdings in Sibur by selling a 17 percent stake to a junior shareholder, Mr. Shamalov. A year earlier, Mr. Shamalov, whose father is a friend and former business partner of Mr. Putin\u2019s, had married the Russian president\u2019s daughter Katerina. His Sibur purchase, which pushed the 32-year-old Mr. Shamalov\u2019s investment to more than 20 percent of the company, was financed by a $1.3 billion loan from the state-backed Gazprombank. Mr. Shamalov sold part of his stake in April, reducing it to 3.9 percent.Most of these financial machinations were carried out through offshore companies on Cyprus, where Mr. Mikhelson and Mr. Timchenko held their investments in Sibur and did business with several Cypriot banks. During the summer of 2014, Mr. Ross had become the Bank of Cyprus\u2019s vice chairman, though there is no indication that he crossed paths with the two oligarchs during his tenure there.Despite the reluctance of Western financial institutions to do business with Sibur and its owners, Navigator\u2019s relationship with Sibur continued to grow.From 2014 to 2015, the portion of Navigator\u2019s total revenue that came from Sibur jumped to 9.1 percent from 5.3 percent, making the company one of its top five clients, according to securities filings, before dipping to 7.9 percent last year.As WL Ross & Co. expanded over the years, it used Appleby, the offshore specialist, to set up an increasing number of entities in tax havens, many in the Cayman Islands. This British territory in the Caribbean levies no corporate or personal income tax on money earned outside its jurisdiction, and requires little disclosure of corporate ownership. By 2014, Mr. Ross and his investment company were among Appleby\u2019s top 20 clients.His financial disclosure form offered more detail, including a list of assets that had been held by each of the partnerships that he retained. Navigator Holdings appeared in connection with four Appleby-managed Cayman partnerships. Mr. Ross\u2019s ethics filing valued his stake in those partnerships at between $2.05 million and $10.1 million, a fraction of the partnerships\u2019 combined 31.5 percent stake in Navigator, which, based on the firm\u2019s recent stock price, was worth roughly $179 million. In all, WL Ross & Co. remains Navigator\u2019s largest shareholder, according to the shipping company\u2019s most recent annual report.Federal ethics law requires officials to recuse themselves from matters that would have \u201ca direct and predictable\u201d effect on their financial interests or cause a reasonable doubt about their impartiality. During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Ross sought to reassure senators that he would avoid any conflicts of interest between his continued business holdings and his cabinet post.\u201cI intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt,\u201d he said.Sasha Chavkin and Martha M. Hamilton are reporters for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Frederik Obermaier and Bastian Obermayer of S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Former Mugabe Allies Are Held Without Bail in Zimbabwe", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 Two former allies of Zimbabwe\u2019s recently ousted president, Robert Mugabe, were ordered held without bail on criminal charges on Monday, in cases that are being closely watched for how the new government will treat Mr. Mugabe\u2019s closest associates.Ignatius Chombo, the former finance minister, faces charges of fraud, abuse of office and violating an anticorruption law. Kudzanai Chipanga, the former head of the youth wing of the governing ZANU-PF party, is accused of communicating falsehoods and undermining public confidence in the Zimbabwe Defense Forces, after he insulted the military\u2019s top commander, Gen. Constantino Chiwenga, at a news conference last month.General Chiwenga played a central role in the military intervention that toppled Mr. Mugabe.But many inside and outside Zimbabwe are fearful that Mr. Mnangagwa will replicate, rather than undo, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s strongman style of governance.Mr. Mugabe, at 93 still widely seen as the father of the country, appears to be personally spared any retribution. Mr. Mugabe\u2019s spokesman has said that the former president will remain in Zimbabwe, and there is a fairly widespread consensus that going after him would destabilize the country.It is not known what, if anything, was promised to Mr. Mugabe and his unpopular wife, Grace, before he resigned last Tuesday just as impeachment proceedings were about to begin. Just as unclear is what might happen to his former associates who lost out in the power struggle.On Monday, Mr. Mnangagwa dissolved Mr. Mugabe\u2019s cabinet and named two allies to top positions, in what appeared to be an effort to reassure neighbors and investors. Patrick Chinamasa will be acting finance minister, and Simbarashe Mumbengegwi will be acting foreign minister.But public attention in Harare, the capital, was more focused on the old guard, represented by Mr. Chombo and Mr. Chipanga.In denying the men bail, a magistrate, Elisha Singano, said that releasing Mr. Chombo would \u201cdisturb the peace and cause a public outcry,\u201d and said that both men posed a flight risk.In addition, the government said the police were still building their case. An investigating officer, Onsimor Chikomba, said that Mr. Chombo, if released, could compromise witnesses who are cooperating with the government.Lovemore Madhuku, a law lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe who is representing the men, said he would appeal the denial of bail.\u201cIt is very disappointing,\u201d Mr. Madhuku said. \u201cThe court appears to have a predetermined position.\u201d\u201cThere was no evidence that my clients would interfere with any witnesses or that they would abscond,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am sure there is a lot of interference coming from elsewhere. I am sure the military control has extended to the judiciary.\u201dMr. Madhuku said his clients told the court that the military detained them for days before handing them over to the police.Mr. Chombo and Mr. Chipanga belong to a faction of the ZANU-PF party called Generation 40, which is allied with Mr. Mugabe\u2019s wife, and which jostled for control with Team Lacoste, Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s faction.Rashweat Mukundu, former director at the Media Institute of Southern Africa in Zimbabwe, said he was worried that the two men\u2019s rights to a fair trial were being infringed upon.\u201cThe greatest threat to the two was being held incommunicado by the military and now that the legal process has begun we have to wait and see how the case proceeds,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important for the state that this matter is handled in a manner that does not indicate persecution as this will be a dent on the political transition underway in Zimbabwe.\u201dSeveral other former allies of Mr. Mugabe have not been heard from since the military intervention, prompting widespread speculation that they might have fled the country to avoid arrest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Take Claims About State and Local Tax Deductions With a Grain of Salt", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact CheckWASHINGTON \u2014 Even some House Republicans are railing against the proposed changes to deductions for state and local taxes that are part of the new House tax bill that was released this week. The proposal to change the state and local tax deduction, commonly known as SALT, has also ignited a backlash from Democrats and state governments.Conservatives call the deduction a boon for high-tax liberal-leaning states at the expense of low-tax conservative-leaning states, while Democrats said its elimination will hurt middle-class families. Here\u2019s an assessment.Under current law, taxpayers can deduct their state and local property taxes, as well as state income taxes or sales tax. The proposed House bill would eliminate the deduction for income and sales taxes, and would cap the deduction for property taxes.The deduction is claimed by taxpayers in every state, though larger percentages of taxpayers in the Northeast and the West benefit from it.Taxpayers in two states, California and New York, claimed more than 32 percent of the total deduction in 2013, the Tax Policy Center estimated.This alone does not mean that Indiana is bankrolling New York. Larger states, like New York and California, are getting bigger subsidies through the state and local tax deduction \u201cbecause they\u2019re paying substantially more in federal taxes,\u201d said Kim Rueben, an author of the Tax Policy Center report.Multiple studies show that most states that are considered to be a \u201cnet donor\u201d \u2014 those that pay more in taxes than they get back from Washington \u2014 also benefit the most from the state and local tax deduction.New Jersey \u2014 where more than 40 percent of taxpayers took the deduction \u2014 experienced the largest deficit per capita. It contributed about $13,000 per person in federal taxes but received just $10,000 per person in federal spending. New York had the largest overall deficit: $41 billion.About 30 percent of all taxpayers claimed the deduction across all income levels, but higher-income households are more likely to claim it.Taxpayers deducted more than $550 billion in state and local taxes in 2015, according to the Government Finance Officers Association \u2014 75 percent of which was claimed by people with incomes over $100,000.The Tax Policy Center estimates that only 11 percent of taxpayers with incomes under $50,000 claimed the deduction, compared with 82 percent of filers with incomes over $100,000. Repealing the deduction altogether would raise taxes on everyone, but taxpayers with incomes over $100,000 would bear the brunt \u2014 over 90 percent \u2014 of the tax hike.Other provisions in the Republican tax plan shield middle-class families from the effect of eliminating state income tax and sales tax deductions and capping property tax deductions. Taxpayers can claim the deductions only if they choose to itemize instead of taking a standard deduction. Because the Republican plan also proposes to double the standard deduction, fewer people will benefit from itemizing, and many in the middle class will stop itemizing altogether, Dr. Rueben said.Middle-class families may feel a less direct effect on eliminating the deduction than what Ms. Pelosi and Democrats are suggesting.Repealing the deductions will \u201cmake it harder for states to make money\u201d and, as a result, it will be more difficult for states to be able to provide services and a social safety net, Dr. Rueben said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greta Gerwig\u2019s Radical Confidence", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "FeatureIn her directorial debut, the writer and actress has created a character rarely seen onscreen: a young girl who loves herself.Supported byThis, Gerwig explained to me recently, was the first inkling she had that she was a Writer-with-a-capital-W. We were having breakfast at Cafe Cluny in the West Village to discuss her new film, \u201cLady Bird,\u201d which she directed from a script she wrote. I asked her why she submitted the pee story to the literary journal. Wasn\u2019t she afraid that the other kids would find out what had happened? \u201cI knew in it there was a story that was funny and sweet,\u201d she said, gesturing over her eggs as if she were conducting them.That\u2019s Gerwig: one of the few women in America so un-self-conscious, so well adjusted, that she was able, as an eighth grader, to look back on a recent episode of classroom incontinence and turn it into something \u201cfunny and sweet.\u201d What she fixates on, telling the story now, is the girl who helped her. In Gerwig\u2019s hands, the story is not primarily about shame, and it is decidedly not about adolescent cruelty or the whispers of gossip. It\u2019s a generous, goofy story about a pratfall, and a meta-story about making a certain kind of art out of life \u2014 an art steeped in female reciprocity and resilience.At 5-foot-9, Gerwig is at once imposing and effortlessly glamorous, though she has the habit of slouching. She had started the morning in a dress by the designer Ulla Johnson, but felt as if she was \u201ctrying too hard\u201d and changed into a plain T-shirt and a pair of black silk karate pants embroidered with ferns. The overall effect was that of a slightly disheveled graduate student. Around her wrists were three strands of beads. She later explained that they were good-luck charms from Jacqueline Knowlton, the lead makeup artist on \u201cLady Bird,\u201d and that she had been wearing them for more than a year. \u201cI\u2019m a sucker for anyone who tells me, \u2018It\u2019s a magical stone, and it\u2019s going to keep you safe.\u2019\u2009\u201dGerwig has acted in 25 films and co-written five, but \u201cLady Bird,\u201d her first solo directorial project, is the most unadulterated distillation of her sensibility to date. The title character is a high-school senior, played with winning naturalness by Saoirse Ronan, who lives in Sacramento and attends an all-girls Catholic school. She was born Christine, but demands to be called by the name she has given herself \u2014 as if she were a pop star, or being constantly confirmed in the faith. The film\u2019s working title was \u201cMothers and Daughters,\u201d and Gerwig is especially attentive to Lady Bird\u2019s tempestuous relationship with her mother, Marion, played with brilliant, wounded toughness by Laurie Metcalf. Their fights hit every note and tempo: nagging, bickering, quarrelsome, sniping, passive-aggression, shouting, screaming, wailing, whispered rage.Lady Bird is a delicious and daring weirdo. She shows up to audition for the school musical with a prepared belter. She runs a long-shot campaign for class president every fall, just because she can. Her hair is stringy and dyed. She is sexy without being conventionally pretty, and when she decides she likes a boy, she writes his name in marker on her bedroom wall and pursues him boldly. Saying that she \u201cputs herself out there\u201d is an understatement. She throws herself over every cliff. (At one point, she throws herself out of a moving car.) She\u2019s the girl \u2014 I\u2019m stealing this from Ronan, who told me that she \u201cadmires\u201d the character \u2014 whom you didn\u2019t even know you wanted to be. That all this buoyant confidence feels so effervescently radical is a testament to the humor and intelligence of Gerwig\u2019s script. That it is so rare is an indictment of our woman-hating culture, which makes a depiction of a smart teenage girl who likes herself and chases her desires seem like news.Gerwig couldn\u2019t have played Lady Bird; she\u2019s 34. But it\u2019s notable that she didn\u2019t choose to write a character she could have played. Perhaps she didn\u2019t want to confuse the issue. A female body onscreen has a way of obscuring, or distracting from, the intelligence offscreen. She is already well established as an actor \u2014 the critic Richard Brody has called her \u201cthe most important new actor\u201d to emerge in the last 10 years of American independent film. What shines through in Gerwig\u2019s performances is a quality of radiant openness. Jay Duplass, the filmmaker and actor who directed Gerwig in the 2008 movie \u201cBaghead,\u201d described her to me as a \u201cspazzy genius\u201d who has \u201cthe courage to let herself unfold in front of other people.\u201d Think of her toddling down the steps behind the Times Square TKTS booth in \u201cMistress America,\u201d issuing a cornball greeting to her soon-to-be-stepsister standing below: \u201cWelcome to the Great White Way!\u201d And the frozen smile on her face, as she continues her grand descent, trying awkwardly, antically, to hold on to the magic of making an entrance.Her smile is of the huge, gum-baring variety. She talks with her whole body. She was a live wire in Mary Bronstein\u2019s \u201cYeast\u201d and enchanting in Whit Stillman\u2019s \u201cDamsels in Distress\u201d and a little out of place in Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s \u201cJackie,\u201d where all she did was stand around. She needs to be moving \u2014 galloping down the street or shoving somebody through a door or doing a shuffle-ball-change. The writer, artist and filmmaker Miranda July, when I asked her about Gerwig\u2019s physicality, told me, \u201cShe looks very strong, and she can either spin that into something that\u2019s grounded and familiar and funny or into something that\u2019s really quite beautiful and dancerly.\u201d She can sing and tap too. I\u2019ve heard her compared to Diane Keaton, which I\u2019m sure she\u2019d like \u2014 for a while as a teenager she tried to dress like Annie Hall \u2014 but I think of her as a taller Irene Dunne. Except that instead of being in movies about love affairs, she is in movies \u2014 and making movies \u2014 about women self-actualizing and paying their bills.The check arrived, and I reached for my wallet. Gerwig became concerned. \u201cYou can put this on The New York Times?\u201d she said. \u201cI just always worry.\u201d After breakfast, while we were power-walking through the West Village, I mentioned that I had seen that she was doing a voice part in Wes Anderson\u2019s forthcoming animated movie, \u201cIsle of Dogs.\u201d She remarked that Anderson\u2019s previous animated film, \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox,\u201d isn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d about animals. \u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d I said, which prompted the beginnings of an earnest analysis, until I cut her off to explain that I had been kidding. \u201cOhhhhh,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand sarcasm. I take it seriously!\u201d Her T\u2019s are shiny and bright, like the ringing of a hand bell.The visual style of \u201cLady Bird\u201d is intentionally unshowy \u2014 most shots are framed and still, so that attention is focused on the actors and the dialogue. Language is what matters. There was no improvisation on the set, and the movie matches the shooting script \u201cprobably 95 percent.\u201d The writer and director Lena Dunham told me that what she often admires about Gerwig\u2019s dialogue is the contrast between erudition and naturalism \u2014 \u201cIn one breath she\u2019ll be referencing a superobscure book and also utilizing the awkward parlance of our times.\u201d \u201cLady Bird\u201d does that, too. Gerwig expects her audience to be well read enough to get what\u2019s funny about a nun referencing Kierkegaard\u2019s \u201clove story\u201d (Kierkegaard broke off his engagement) but also to laugh when Lady Bird tells her friend that they\u2019re done with \u201cthe learning portion of high school.\u201d The rhythm is very quick, and much of the humor lies in the way that characters respond to or undercut one another. My favorite joke of the movie is when Lady Bird, after passing her driver\u2019s test, profusely thanks the guy from the D.M.V. \u201cIt\u2019s not a thanking situation,\u201d he says. \u201cYou either pass or you don\u2019t.\u201dThe plot is structured according to the \u201crituals\u201d of senior year \u2014 homecoming, prom \u2014 which Gerwig has said she imagined \u201cunfolding in a series of placed scenes like Stations of the Cross.\u201d Emotional drama presents itself in the form of Lady Bird\u2019s two boyfriends, Danny and Kyle, and a rough patch with her best friend, Julie, but the big narrative question is where Lady Bird will go to college. She longs to go to a private East Coast (i.e., outrageously expensive) college; her family expects her to stay in state. As it is, they\u2019re barely keeping it together, moneywise. Marion works double shifts as a psychiatric nurse, and Lady Bird\u2019s father, played by Tracy Letts, has lost his job. They live in a shabby, cramped house that is literally on the wrong side of the railroad tracks. (Marion and Lady Bird\u2019s favorite Sunday-afternoon activity is dropping in at real estate open houses and admiring what they cannot have.) But \u201cthose East Coast schools\u201d carry complex symbolic weight for Lady Bird: They mean possibility, and glamour, and leaving home, and something like self-worth. The movie doesn\u2019t totally endorse her fantasy, but it is a little unsettling, in this moment, to witness a narrative triumph that hinges on a teenager\u2019s assumption of a lifetime of student debt.Gerwig wrote \u201cLady Bird\u201d partly as a response to films about boys growing up. At the New York Film Festival, she asked the crowd: \u201cWhat is \u2018Boyhood,\u2019 but for a girl? What is \u2018The 400 Blows,\u2019 but for a girl? What is personhood for young women?\u201d In most films, girls exist to be looked at. Sometimes they help a male protagonist come to a realization about himself. Sometimes they die. Gerwig makes Lady Bird the one who looks: at boys but also houses, magazines, books, clothes and at the city of Sacramento. She also takes the wind out of a particular kind of male self-seriousness around cultural objects. Toward the end of the movie, a very drunk Lady Bird is in her dorm room with a boy \u2014 the kind of boy who would invite you to see \u201cThe 400 Blows\u201d on a first date \u2014 who is flipping through her CD case. He scoffs that her taste in music sucks: All she has are greatest-hits albums. \u201cBut they\u2019re the greatest,\u201d she says. They immediately start making out.\u201cAutobiographical\u201d can carry a whiff of dismissal, a suggestion that the achievement was somehow easier to pull off because it involved less creative effort. There are, to be sure, parallels to reality: Gerwig is from Sacramento and went to an all-girls Catholic school before attending a college in New York, Barnard, on scholarships and loans. But she wasn\u2019t like Lady Bird as a high-school student. She followed the rules.Still, only a person who liked high school could have written this movie. And Gerwig liked high school. There were the usual cliques and hierarchies, but because it was a Catholic school, the focus was on being a good citizen of the community and using your talents for a higher purpose. She refers to the nuns who taught her as \u201creally groovy.\u201d She admits to \u201csome teenage anger\u201d and says that her fights with her mother were \u201cepic,\u201d but \u201cfor me, epic fighting never spelled lack of love.\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cSome of my friends have been, like, \u2018You can really scare the [expletive] out of me,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, no, that\u2019s just me being close!\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cThese are my parents,\u201d Gerwig said, holding out her phone.We were in a greenroom at Lincoln Center, during the New York Film Festival. Previously I had seen Gerwig dressed down in casual settings, carrying a backpack: drinking coffee on a park bench, being shushed at Film Forum for talking during a movie. Now she was in busy professional mode: Proenza Schouler dress, eyeliner, flanked by publicists. On the phone, her parents were squinting in sunshine, from what looked to be a very nice vacation in San Diego.Gerwig is close to her parents. (They appeared as Frances\u2019s parents in \u201cFrances Ha.\u201d) Her mother is a retired OB/GYN nurse and her father works in small-business loans for a credit union. \u201cI always felt like they were both artists without being artists,\u201d she said. At the holidays, the house overflowed with guests. Her father plays \u201ca ton\u201d of instruments. Her mother has a closet in the hallway where she keeps presents, wrapped, for all different ages \u2014 just in case someone comes over and it\u2019s her birthday.As a child, Gerwig had a tendency to become obsessive \u2014 first about ballet, which she had to quit (her hips lacked turnout, and her knees couldn\u2019t take it), and then about fencing, which her mother urged her to put aside, lest she become \u201ca mono-person.\u201d In high school she got into theater, and in college she continued acting and writing plays. One play she wrote featured a seduction scene in which someone breaks a jar of mayonnaise onstage. Another one, which involved a daughter murdering her mother, was written in two weeks\u2019 time, after a group lost the rights to perform \u201cMisery.\u201d She always liked movies, but it wasn\u2019t until she started renting DVDs from the indie video store Kim\u2019s while a student at Barnard that she thought of film as an art made by directors. \u201cBeau Travail\u201d was the movie that helped her truly understand cinema. She didn\u2019t realize until she saw Claire Denis\u2019s name in the credits that it had been directed by a woman. She remembers thinking: That\u2019s a job you can have?After she was rejected from M.F.A. programs in playwriting, she began acting in very-low-budget, independent \u201cmumblecore\u201d films, including \u201cLOL,\u201d \u201cHannah Takes the Stairs\u201d and \u201cNights and Weekends,\u201d which she directed with Joe Swanberg. In 2010 she broke through to the mainstream, when she appeared in Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cGreenberg.\u201d After \u201cGreenberg,\u201d she and Baumbach, who had been married to Jennifer Jason Leigh, became a couple, and together they wrote two films that Gerwig starred in: \u201cFrances Ha\u201d and \u201cMistress America,\u201d which feature some unmistakable Gerwigian traits. Their protagonists are semidelusional female dreamers, surrounded by rich people and anxious about money, with hearts pure enough to put them in a Dostoyevsky novel. But film is a director\u2019s medium, and occasionally Gerwig\u2019s work on these projects was dismissed by journalists and people in the industry. \u201cSomething that used to really hurt me is, people would say, \u2018Did you help write the script?\u2019 And I\u2019d say: \u2018I co-wrote it. I didn\u2019t \u201chelp\u201d to write it,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. \u201cIt used to make my blood rise.\u201dGerwig calls her last 10 years of working in film \u201cmy version of my 10,000 hours.\u201d When she finished the writing of \u201cLady Bird\u201d in 2015, she knew she had to direct it herself. \u201cI thought, Yes, there is more to learn, but you are not going to keep learning it by not doing it. You will only now learn the next part if you go ahead and do it.\u201dActing in films under two female directors, Rebecca Miller and Mia Hansen-Love, helped \u201cshift\u201d something in her. She recalls a conversation with Hansen-Love, who had been in two films directed by her partner, Olivier Assayas. \u201cShe had worked at Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma,\u201d Gerwig says. \u201cShe said that the other young male writers there treated her dismissively because they thought of her as Olivier\u2019s girlfriend, who got there because she was his girlfriend, and how they changed when she had her first movie at Cannes, when she was in her 20s. All of a sudden they looked at her like they\u2019d never seen her before. I hung onto that story. All those little pieces I put in my pocket. I think I needed these little signs.\u201d\u201cI trusted her completely,\u201d says Metcalf, who adds that she relied on Gerwig to help her understand the character of Marion. \u201cOn the page it could just be like a nonstop aggression. But she taught me what the character was covering up.\u201d\u201cI wanted Marion to secretly be the main character,\u201d Gerwig told me. \u201cI kind of wanted her to take over the movie.\u201dThe history of mothers on film is one littered with angels and witches. Marion is neither. She\u2019s tender and loving but doesn\u2019t know how to express it; she is often impatient, can be nasty and aggressive and doesn\u2019t support Lady Bird in the way she wants to be supported. (We might call this good mothering, in that she is helping Lady Bird to separate from home.) She doesn\u2019t exactly take over the movie \u2014 the film ends on a shot of Lady Bird, alone, on a New York street, with Marion left behind \u2014 but she does center it. There is one scene in particular that is a kind of anchor. It shows Marion at her sewing machine, fixing a dress that Lady Bird will wear to a fancy Thanksgiving dinner at her boyfriend\u2019s grandmother\u2019s mansion. Marion would prefer that Lady Bird spend Thanksgiving at home, but she\u2019s helping her anyway, first by shopping with her at the thrift store, and now by mending the dress.The shot is framed squarely, in dim lighting, with Metcalf looking drab and dour in the center. It is very brief, a few seconds long, and silent, except for the wild thrum of the needle. It\u2019s Gerwig\u2019s homage to \u201cJeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,\u201d Chantal Akerman\u2019s classic 1975 drama of a three-day unraveling, consisting mostly of shots of a woman doing repeated household chores. Gerwig told the audience at the New York Film Festival that she was moved by a remark that Akerman once made about the importance of seeing images of housework on film. \u201cWe value watching a woman get raped more than we value her making dinner,\u201d Gerwig said, incredulity and disgust mixing in her voice. If there are Lady Birds in the world, it is only because there are Marions \u2014 mothers, and foremothers \u2014 who brought them up. Lady Bird will put on the dress and wear it out and think nothing of it. But we saw the care Marion took, late at night and all alone, to alter, ever so slightly, what was possible.Christine Smallwood is a writer and critic living in New York.

{"Headline": "Being Deported From Home for the Holidays", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySide StreetLiany and Maria Villacis grew up in a family that did everything together. Each summer, even when money was tight, their parents made sure to take a week\u2019s vacation, no matter how modest. Last summer, when Liany, 22, was in a finance training program in Chicago, her parents and twin sister took their family vacation in the Windy City.Their closeness was a result of circumstance as much as blood: The twins were born in Pasto, Colombia, where their mother, Liany Guerrero, hailed from a politically active family. But when they started receiving death threats from rebel groups \u2014 along with unsettling snapshots of the girls at play \u2014 they sought political asylum in 2001 in New York with their father, Juan Villacis, whose mother lived in the Woodhaven section of Queens.They paid their taxes and stayed out of trouble. The twins prospered and did well in school and college. And every year, when the parents went to see the authorities at Immigration and Customs Enforcement to renew their stay of removal, they went as a family.After this year\u2019s meeting, they came home one short.On Nov. 15, Juan was detained and sent to the Bergen County Jail in New Jersey to await deportation to his native Ecuador in the coming weeks. His wife was allowed to go home, but under supervision and with orders to return this week to prove she has purchased a one-way ticket back to Colombia for mid-January. Their lawyer, Jillian Hopman, was stunned by what she saw as a heartless bureaucracy going after low-hanging fruit rather than the \u201cbad hombres\u201d of legend.\u201cFor a family that does everything together, this is heartbreaking,\u201d Ms. Hopman said. \u201cJuan\u2019s mother\u2019s health has seriously deteriorated, and he is the one who cares for her. His wife has all kinds of medical problems, including complex cysts in her breasts. ICE did not care about any of this. Juan could have won the Nobel Prize and taken a bullet for Mike Pence. All he has become is a statistic.\u201dAdding to the sting, immigration officers refused to let the twins or his wife give him a final hug goodbye, Ms. Hopman said.\u201cThey told us they no longer provide that courtesy,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t like emotional scenes.\u201dRachael Yong Yow, a spokeswoman for the immigration agency, did not respond to questions submitted last week by email.Maria said her family arrived with valid visas in 2001 and immediately sought political asylum. However, she said, their lawyer at the time stressed the family\u2019s social class \u2014 rather than political affiliation \u2014 as the reason they were targeted by rebels. Although their application was denied, they obtained stays of removal every year. Ms. Hopman took their case in 2010.The twins did not expect things to go awry this year: Their father\u2019s mother, a United States citizen who is confined to bed and in poor health, has applied for him to become a legal resident, but there is nearly a five-year backlog of cases. Their mother\u2019s health makes the situation critical, too, they thought.Instead, their lawyer emerged with bad news.\u201cMy mom went completely pale and held onto her knees,\u201d said Liany, who with her sister has protection for now under DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \u201cShe was just staring at the floor, saying there had to be a mistake.\u201dFriends of the family agree. Alberto Roig, a retired Manhattan prosecutor who also was assistant counsel to former Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly of the New York Police Department, was dumbstruck by the prospect that the family he has known for years would be broken up.\u201cThey\u2019re not some schmoes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe girls are incredible because the parents are incredible. They are contributing to our society. They follow the law. They\u2019re legit. And what do we do, kick them out and slam the door? This is a tremendous injustice.\u201dNow is the time of year when Juan would have hauled out the Christmas decorations and strung up the lights around the porch of the family\u2019s Dutch Colonial-style home just off the elevated train on Jamaica Avenue in Queens. Instead, it is dark. Inside, his electric drum kit and saxophone rest against a wall, silent. Just the sight of them moved his wife to tears the day she returned home without him.\u201cOur family life was broken abruptly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like half of my heart was cut out. We always made the effort to keep our family united. We did everything to educate our daughters. Juan is his mother\u2019s only hope. We worked hard and paid taxes. What did we do wrong to deserve this?\u201dShe has prided herself on never missing appointments and doing whatever the authorities asked. One request she has yet to fulfill is buying her ticket to Colombia.\u201cI know I have to get it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have the hope that someone will notice our case and say no, this can\u2019t happen. Hope is the last thing you lose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Wine Books to Give This Holiday Season", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThe fascination with wine begins with the land, which year after year has the potential to produce something different and original from the same vineyard.So it is with wine writers, who each year plow more or less the same terrain, finding novel and provocative ways of presenting their material. Here are five of the most interesting books on wine that were published in 2017, which would make excellent gifts for friends, loved ones or yourself.In transparent prose, Mr. Liem looks back on the winemaking history of the region, which has been obscured in effervescent mythology. He makes a compelling case for the historic importance of place and terroir in Champagne, a departure from decades of marketing that focused on the cellar work of master blenders rather than on the land.While the recent story of Champagne is often framed in terms of simple, black-and-white trends \u2014 the triumph of small farmers, who also produce wines, over the big Champagne houses; the rise of the extra brut and brut nature styles; the increasing importance of single-vineyard Champagnes \u2014 Mr. Liem never settles for the easy conclusion.For Mr. Liem, an American who lives in Champagne, the increasing exploration and understanding of the region\u2019s terroirs is the crucial element in improving the wine and deepening our comprehension of it. But that does not mean, he insists, that a Burgundy-style shift to producing microscopic expressions of the land is in the best interests of the wine or the producers. Nor does he countenance any of the various trends as intrinsic improvements. He is admirably unbiased and authoritative.The history is illuminating, as is the section describing individual growers and houses. Yet the beating heart of the book is a careful examination of Champagne\u2019s terroir, village by village and almost plot by plot. This is enhanced by Mr. Liem\u2019s discovery and reproduction of intricate 1940s-era maps of Champagne, demonstrating that the understanding of the land is not something new, but something old that is being rediscovered.These maps are included as a separate element of a boxed set, a packaging decision that explains the $80 list price. Nonetheless, this is a welcome, essential guide that succeeds in transporting our understanding of Champagne into the 21st century.Ms. Feiring, who has written numerous books on natural wine, and Ms. Lepeltier, a leading sommelier, survey the various geological formations on which the most distinctive wines are grown. Whether granite, limestone, basalt, shale, gravel, slate or clay, each, they argue, imparts consistent characteristics when matched with the proper grapes, particularly when carefully and conscientiously farmed.The link between soil and wine, they acknowledge, is not clearly understood by scientists. Indeed, some scientists reject it, preferring to focus on climate as the most important factor for growing grapes. Yet anyone who has ever compared the chardonnay grown in the Kimmeridgian limestone of Chablis with any other grown elsewhere can\u2019t help but think that soil must play a crucial role in shaping the distinctive qualities of that wine. I certainly do.This book is not intended as a scientific treatise. It\u2019s more a once-over-lightly juxtaposition of soil types and wine characteristics, along with a look at the grapes that thrive in each type of soil and suggestions of wine producers to seek out. Still, it is exhilarating to apply this paradigm to wine, even in a decidedly general way.Ms. Feiring is occasionally prone to eye-rolling self-absorption \u2014 asserting, for example, that she wasn\u2019t the first to discover Barolo, which is a little like reminding people that she didn\u2019t discover fire \u2014 and to unconvincing statements that seem primarily ideological, as in a wholesale rejection of first-growth Bordeaux since 1986. This book, though, is an important and useful challenge to think about wine in a different way.To that end he has enumerated 89 \u201crules\u201d (perhaps a more marketable term than \u201csuggestions\u201d) in no particular order, with the goal of helping consumers to relax and to better discern between what is important and what is not.How to select a wine, how to serve it, how to store it, how to pair it with food: These are among the topics that many consumers find so challenging. Mr. Bonn\u00e9 succeeds in extracting the answers from decades of overwrought expert instruction and presenting them in a clear, easygoing mannerThis is not a reference work. It has no index. Rather, it is a Zen-like reminder that wine is a joy, not a chore; a journey, not a race. Beginners and even confident wine drinkers will find much of value, even leafing through rules at random.\u201cIn Vino\u201d examines the story of Rudy Kurniawan, a wine collector of mysterious wealth and origin, who fooled a coterie of even wealthier collectors along with covetous hangers-on, bilking them all with fraudulent bottles of rare, old wines, many of which he created in his kitchen.Mr. Hellman, a veteran journalist who covered the case, allows the story to unfold with spare prose. He presents, without overt judgment, the macho, competitive, one-upmanship world of the collectors, an atmosphere that perhaps contributed to their gullibility in the high-rolling economy of the early 2000s. This, along with the desperation to possess, seemed a greater motivation among these collectors than an actual love of wine.While Mr. Kurniawan is currently serving a prison sentence, Mr. Hellman acknowledges that many unanswered questions remain. How exactly did the forger accumulate his nest egg? Could he really have been working alone? And for anyone about to open a bottle of expensive, old wine, is it real?Ms. Anson, a contributing editor at Decanter, the British wine magazine, briefly outlines these agricultural and winemaking philosophies and offers capsule profiles of wine producers and their bottles. Her taste is exceptional, and while she at times retreats to the sort of winemaking jargon that you would typically find in a wine-oriented publication, general-interest readers will profit as well.Purists might complain about some of her entries, but I find the absence of rigidity refreshing. The producers she cites, and their ways of thinking, will have you drinking better in no time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Eases Limits on Foreign Stakes in Financial Firms", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Hours after President Trump left China with a warning about its trade practices, Beijing threw him \u2014 and Wall Street \u2014 a bone.The Chinese government said on Friday that it would relax or remove a broad range of limits on foreign ownership of banks and securities firms. The move could inject a little foreign know-how into a vast financial system that helped fuel China\u2019s economic rise but that in recent years has become burdened with debt, bubbles and inefficiencies.Foreign firms may not rush in right away. Global financial institutions have been cautious about investing in China, partly because they would be required to buy mostly Chinese-made telecommunications equipment for their operations here and to store financial data here as part of the country\u2019s tough new cybersecurity laws.Still, the Chinese initiative could help Beijing rally political support from Wall Street banks and securities firms, which have profited from fees on Chinese purchases of American companies but have long been limited in what they could do inside China.Goldman Sachs Group praised the Chinese move, saying, \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s announcement and look forward to playing a greater role in China\u2019s capital markets.\u201dChina keeps tight limits on a number of industries it considers vital, including energy, transportation, the media and financial services. Companies in the United States, Europe and Japan have increasingly complained about being limited in those markets or shut out entirely, even as Chinese companies make their own investments in similar industries outside its borders. In many cases, Beijing\u2019s limits have given rise to Chinese giants who dominate markets at home.Officials in Beijing had previously said the government would open the financial sector to outside money, but Friday\u2019s move offered the first concrete details.Zhu Guangyao, China\u2019s vice finance minister, said that his country would start allowing foreign investors to own 51 percent of Chinese securities firms, fund managers and futures companies, and would allow them to own 100 percent three years from now. The current limit on foreign ownership is 25 percent for large, publicly traded securities firms and 49 percent for most other businesses in these categories.Mr. Zhu said that China would also raise the allowed foreign investment in insurance companies, currently 50 percent for most companies, to 51 percent in three years and 100 percent in five years. China also plans to eliminate its current limit of 25 percent foreign ownership in banks, Mr. Zhu said, but he did not say when it might happen.While the moves were announced several hours after Mr. Trump and his advisers flew to Vietnam, Mr. Zhu said that the initiatives were the result of decisions made during the Communist Party\u2019s congress last month. Trump administration officials shied away from making commitments while in Beijing over market access, the sort of horse-trading that marked previous presidential visits. They have also been distracted by domestic issues and other trade issues.\u201cSpeaking over all, it is a good thing,\u201d said Liu Dongliang, an analyst at China Merchants Bank. \u201cThere will be more different kinds of capital involved, and their management ideas and risk control ideas may arouse some reaction.\u201dAmerican financial institutions cautiously welcomed the Chinese move. Citibank said that its existing operations in China were already growing, with more than $1 billion a year in China-related revenue, and that it wanted to study the details of the new regulations when they were released.China promised when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 that it would rapidly open up its financial markets to foreign competition. Foreign commercial banks were then disappointed when Chinese regulators set high capital requirements for each foreign bank branch, limiting their ability to expand.But the rise of online banking has reduced the need for bank branches, and so has the rise of electronic payments. Over the past couple of years, Citibank has been gradually closing some of its retail branches in China, as it has done in the United States. According to the bank, 95 percent of its retail banking transactions now take place outside bank branches.Yet foreign banks hold just 1.5 percent of the assets in China\u2019s credit-swollen banking system. State-owned banks have flooded credit markets with so many loans that finding large, financially stable, creditworthy borrowers has become harder in China, forcing newcomers to enter the treacherous market of providing loans to smaller enterprises at a time when the entire Chinese economy is gradually slowing.China\u2019s financial markets have a reputation for fraud and manipulation, particularly the stock market. Increasing the role of foreign firms in these markets could help introduce overseas practices that might limit misconduct.Asset management companies have already been expanding their role in China, and the new rules announced by Mr. Zhu could speed that process. Peter L. Alexander, the founder and managing director of Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai financial consulting firm, said that because Chinese investors tended to have large holdings in relatively simple money market funds and had not yet shown much interest in purchasing exchange-traded funds, \u201cthere\u2019s an opportunity for active managers.\u201dMr. Zhu also repeated on Friday a Chinese pledge made late Thursday to ease joint-venture requirements for electric cars and other so-called new energy vehicles that may be built in China\u2019s free-trade zones. Unlike any other large car manufacturing nation, China requires either that all cars sold within its borders be assembled in a 50-50 joint venture with a local partner or that an import tax of at least 25 percent be paid, plus a range of other taxes.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Children\u2019s Health Bill Clears House as States Struggle to Keep Programs Afloat", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House passed a bill on Friday that would provide five years of funds for the popular Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, over vehement objections from Democrats who opposed the way it would be financed.In the House, 15 Democrats joined 227 Republicans in voting for the measure on Friday. Only three Republicans voted against it.The bill would provide money for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and clinics known as community health centers, which care for low- and moderate-income people around the country. Both programs have enthusiastic support across the political spectrum.But lawmakers clashed over how to pay for them. To offset the cost, the House bill would increase premiums for Medicare beneficiaries with income of more than $500,000 a year, remove some lottery winners from the Medicaid rolls, and cut $6.35 billion over 10 years from a fund established by the Affordable Care Act to pay for public health initiatives such as preventing diabetes, heart disease, cancer and opioid abuse.In addition, the bill would end insurance coverage for several hundred thousand people who fail to pay their share of premiums for insurance purchased in marketplaces under the 2010 health care law.Most people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace receive subsidies to help pay their monthly premiums. Under the law, if they do not pay their share of premiums, insurers must give them a three-month grace period before terminating their coverage. The House bill would reduce the grace period to one month unless a state specified a different period.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the government would save nearly $5 billion over a decade because fewer people would have government-subsidized coverage.Republicans said some people were abusing the longer grace period to skip out of their financial obligations. But Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado, said, \u201cNobody should have to lose coverage in order for others to keep it.\u201d\u201cColorado is likely to run out of CHIP funding in January, with termination notices going out to worried families in the next few weeks,\u201d Ms. DeGette said. \u201cYet here we are with a partisan bill that asks us to pay for low-income children\u2019s insurance on the backs of seniors and the most vulnerable.\u201dRepublicans defended their path to pay for the children\u2019s health program, especially the higher Medicare premiums. It was reasonable to require wealthy people to help defray the cost of care for children from families of modest means, they said.\u201cWhen you are making a half-million dollars a year, you can pay a little bit more,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. \u201cWarren Buffett and Donald Trump don\u2019t need the same Medicare program that Ma and Pa Kettle living on Social Security do.\u201dDemocrats, who often seek higher taxes on high-income people, denounced the proposal.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about whether wealthy families can afford to pay increased Medicare premiums,\u201d said Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan. \u201cBut I\u2019m worried that these changes will result in wealthy people abandoning the program in large numbers, which would worsen the risk pool and ultimately increase the cost for middle- and lower-income seniors. It would fracture the universal nature of Medicare and put the entire program at risk.\u201dAARP, the lobby for older Americans, strongly supports the children\u2019s insurance program, but tried to block the increase in Medicare premiums.\u201cHigher-income Medicare beneficiaries already pay more in monthly premiums,\u201d Nancy LeaMond, an executive vice president of AARP, said in a letter to House members. In addition, she said, \u201chigher-income seniors have been paying more into the Medicare program throughout their working lives.\u201dBut Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chief author of the bill, said, \u201cWe are just asking the wealthiest seniors in America, those making $40,000 a month \u2014 not a year, a month \u2014 to pay about $135 a month more for their Medicare, so we can fund children\u2019s health insurance for five years.\u201dFive states \u2014 Arizona, California, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington \u2014 have received emergency infusions of federal cash to prevent an interruption in coverage of children. But the amount of unused funds available for that purpose is far less than the expected need, and an independent commission that advises Congress warned this week that 29 states \u201cwill exhaust all available federal funds\u201d by March unless Congress passed legislation to provide more money.In the Senate, work on CHIP legislation has been bipartisan from the start. The Senate Finance Committee has voted to provide five years of funds for the program, but it has not specified a way to cover the cost.The committee chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the panel, have been discussing ways to pay for the bill. They have not reported much progress toward an agreement, but their talks hold more promise than negotiations between Republicans and Democrats in the House.The Senate is unlikely to take up a free-standing CHIP bill. Funds could be included in a larger piece of legislation, perhaps a sprawling spending bill in December to keep the government open, senators say.The House bill would send $1 billion in additional Medicaid funds to Puerto Rico as it tries to cope with damage from Hurricane Maria, and the island\u2019s delegate in Congress, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, a Republican, endorsed the legislation.Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said Republicans had missed the deadline for renewing the children\u2019s insurance program because they \u201cchose to spend the first nine months of this year trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201dBut Mr. Walden said Democrats were partly responsible because they had requested delays in hopes of finding other ways to pay for the legislation.\u201cWe cannot wait any longer,\u201d Mr. Walden said Friday. \u201cPatients cannot wait any longer. Patients need care. These critical programs need funding. And we must move forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kyle Martino Enters Race for U.S. Soccer President", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe increasingly crowded race to lead U.S. Soccer \u2014 the field of candidates already includes two World Cup veterans, a member of the federation board and a well-connected lawyer or two \u2014 is getting perhaps its biggest name yet.Kyle Martino, a former United States national team midfielder now more familiar to fans for his role on NBC Sports\u2019 Premier League broadcasts, has decided to leave his \u201cdream job\u201d and mount a bid to replace the longtime incumbent Sunil Gulati as president of U.S. Soccer.Martino said he changed his mind because he was adamant that the time had come for a true \u201csoccer guy\u201d to run a federation that is thriving economically but is struggling to keep up with rivals on the field and is deeply divided about the leadership of Gulati in the wake of the men\u2019s national team\u2019s elimination from qualifying for the 2018 World Cup last month.\u201cThis is not about a person for a person,\u201d Martino said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one person who\u2019s going to save U.S. Soccer. This is about a consortium.\u201cWhen a club in England is failing and they\u2019re in jeopardy of going into administration and disappearing, fans, former players, business people \u2014 they all get together with their time, experiences and resources with the sole purpose of saving a club they love. We need to do that with U.S. Soccer.\u201cWe need a group, to step up and say, \u2018Enough is enough, we\u2019re here to save this thing.\u2019 I can mobilize that group.\u201dAfter having worked the weekend in his usual studio role, as the lone American on NBC\u2019s team of Premier League broadcasters, Martino, 36, is leaving the network immediately to begin traveling the country to build out his consortium and learn to \u201cspeak every language of the U.S. soccer community\u201d in advance of the federation\u2019s election on Feb. 10. Candidates have until Dec. 12 to announce their intention to run and submit the required nominations.Martino is the third prominent ex-U.S. player to announce his intention to run for the presidency, joining his fellow broadcaster Eric Wynalda and the two-time World Cup veteran Paul Caligiuri, who scored the 1989 goal that ended a 40-year absence for the United States from soccer\u2019s biggest event and started a run of seven straight World Cup appearances.The election for president of U.S. Soccer is not so much a popularity contest as it is a coalition-building proposition. U.S. Soccer\u2019s president is elected in a vote of representatives of its various councils: 25 percent shares for the youth, adult and pro councils; 20 percent to an athletes council; and the rest to a small group that includes board members, life members and even a fan representative.\u201cWhoever is president has to genuinely want to work with Sunil, because that\u2019s the only way we can bring U.S. Soccer forward,\u201d Martino said. \u201cSunil has gotten us a seat at the head table. But whether Sunil runs again or not, my motivation will always be to protect U.S. Soccer from a president not capable of fixing our soccer problems. Who we need right now is secondary to what we need, which is a soccer vision.\u201cThe first thing people are going to say when they see that I\u2019ve come forward is, \u2018What does he know about running a $100 million company?\u2019 But the business side of U.S. soccer is thriving. We don\u2019t need an M.B.A. right now. We need a soccer Ph.D. And that\u2019s what I have.\u201dThe three pillars of Martino\u2019s plan are:\u25a0 Transparency.

Martino said one of his initial motivations in publicly declaring that he would not run recently was to highlight the fact that the position is currently unpaid, because that \u201ccreates a barrier for entry to qualified candidates.\u201d\u25a0 Equality. A prime area of concern for Martino, he said, is youth players who are being priced out of the game by the financial barriers they encounter, but also players at all levels who feel \u201cunsafe\u201d in locker rooms and what he calls \u201cthe mistreatment of our female athletes.\u201d\u201cOur women are World Cup winners,\u201d Martino said. \u201cWhy are they playing on artificial surfaces? Why are they sleeping in beds with bed bugs? Why aren\u2019t they paid the same as the men? And if you look at the U.S. soccer structure, why don\u2019t women have positions of influence? There are no good answers to these questions.\u201d\u25a0 Progress.

He said he would start a fund-raising drive to finance his campaign, and that he will promptly sell his minority share in the Spanish third division club Real Mallorca to its majority owner Robert Sarver, who also owns the Phoenix Suns.\u201cI just got to the point where I felt I had to serve \u2014 I had to take the leap,\u201d Martino said. \u201cI had a conversation with my wife in our kitchen, which went into the wee hours of the morning, and I told her I won\u2019t be able to forgive myself if I don\u2019t stand up for U.S. Soccer right now.\u201cI didn\u2019t dream of doing this job, but I know I have to do it.

{"Headline": "Bobby Baker, String-Puller Snared in Senate Scandal, Dies at 89", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBobby Baker, a onetime Senate page who, through his close ties to Lyndon B. Johnson and others, became one of the most influential nonelected men in the American government of the 1950s and early \u201960s, only to be investigated for and eventually convicted of tax evasion and other crimes, died on Sunday, his 89th birthday, in St. Augustine, Fla.Mr. Baker arrived in Washington as a teenage Senate page and by 1955 had risen to secretary of the Senate Democrats, an important behind-the-scenes role in which he counted votes on pending legislation, served as a conduit for influence trading and saw to senators\u2019 needs, including extracurricular ones.He became so powerful that he would refer to himself as the 101st senator, and as he and Johnson, the Senate majority leader, formed a symbiotic relationship, others took to calling him Little Lyndon.But his power and knowledge did not make him immune from scrutiny. In 1963 he became the focus of a corruption investigation, one that for a time threatened to envelop Johnson, by then the vice president, and even President John F. Kennedy.Kennedy\u2019s assassination in November 1963 took some steam out of the investigation \u2014 once Johnson became president, there was little inclination to pursue him \u2014 but Mr. Baker was convicted in 1967 of tax evasion, conspiracy to defraud the government and theft. After appeals, he went to prison in 1971 and served 15 months.\u201cRussia wouldn\u2019t have treated me the way this country has,\u201d Mr. Baker said as he was beginning his sentence. \u201cBut I have no great resentment. No, this is a great country. It\u2019s done a lot for me. I like to think I have done a lot for it.\u201dRobert Gene Baker was born on Nov. 12, 1928, in Easley, S.C., the oldest of eight children. He was named after two sports figures, the golfer Bobby Jones and the boxer Gene Tunney. His father, Ernest, was a postal worker; his mother was the former Mary Elizabeth Norman.When he was 14 he received an appointment to the Senate Page School after another local boy turned the offer down. Mr. Baker would later receive a law degree from American University.\u201cI went in,\u201d Mr. Baker said, \u201cand Senator-elect Johnson said, \u2018Mr. Baker, they tell me you\u2019re the smartest son of a bitch over there.\u2019 That was my introduction to him.\u201dWhen Johnson became Senate majority leader in 1955, he made Mr. Baker secretary to the majority. Mr. Baker proved especially adept at the math of the Senate \u2014 he would usually know precisely how many votes a piece of legislation could garner at any given moment, a valuable skill in the horse-trading world of Washington politics.He also helped establish the Quorum Club, a private retreat where members of Congress, their staff members and lobbyists would mingle and, it was said, arrange sexual liaisons.During his time as a public servant, Mr. Baker was also pursing various business ventures: real estate, hotels, a vending machine company. In 1963, an associate in the vending business brought a civil suit against him, and the resulting publicity soon drew the scrutiny of the Justice Department and other investigative bodies. They wondered, among other things, how Mr. Baker could have become a millionaire when his government job paid less than $20,000 a year.Mr. Baker resigned from his post in October 1963, hoping to quiet the inquiry, which had begun to seem as if it might embroil Johnson and, through the sexual goings-on at the Quorum Club, perhaps Kennedy. The investigation resumed once the turmoil of the assassination had receded, and though it was now largely confined to Mr. Baker, it fueled a view that Washington as a whole was cancerous.Mr. Baker validated that portrait with his memoir, \u201cWheeling and Dealing: Confessions of a Capitol Hill Operator,\u201d written with Larry L. King, the author of \u201cThe Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\u201dAs Mr. Schlesinger noted, Mr. Baker suggested in the book that whatever his misdeeds, he was merely taking his cue from the formidable political figures he had been surrounded by since he was a teenager.Mr. Baker wrote: \u201cAs they presumed their high stations to entitle them to accept gratuities or hospitalities from patrons who had special axes to grind, so did I. As they used their powerful positions to gain loans or credit that otherwise might not have been granted, so did I.\u201dMr. Baker married Dorothy Comstock in 1949. She died in 2014. His survivors include two sons, Robert and James; two daughters, Lynda Baker and Cissy Baker Allison; 14 grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren; and several siblings. He lived in St. Augustine.He worked in the real estate and hotel business after his release from prison.In 1971, as he was starting his prison sentence, Mr. Baker, who had many stories involving large amounts of cash and politicians, spoke of a need to reform the campaign financing system, sounding very much like a critic of the system today.\u201cIt will destroy this country unless something is done,\u201d he told Time magazine. \u201cPeople are selling their souls.

At a congressional hearing on Tuesday, he pushed back against Republicans impatient for a special counsel. But if he or his deputy ultimately does authorize a new investigation of Mrs. Clinton, it would shatter post-Watergate norms intended to prevent presidents from using law enforcement agencies against political rivals.The request alone was enough to incite a political backlash, as critics of Mr. Trump quickly denounced what they called \u201cbanana republic\u201d politics of retribution, akin to autocratic nations where election losers are jailed by winners.But conservatives said Mrs. Clinton should not be immune from scrutiny as a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, investigates Russia\u2019s interference in last year\u2019s election and any connections to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. They argued, for example, that Mrs. Clinton was the one doing Russia\u2019s bidding in the form of a uranium deal approved when she was secretary of state.At Tuesday\u2019s hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Sessions denied that he was responding to Mr. Trump\u2019s public pressure. \u201cA president cannot improperly influence an investigation,\u201d he said, \u201cand I have not been improperly influenced and would not be improperly influenced. The president speaks his mind. He\u2019s a bold and direct about what he says, but people elected him. But we do our duty every day based on the law and facts.\u201dEven as he rebuffed Democrats suggesting he had been compromised, Mr. Sessions pushed back against Republicans who pressed him on why he had not already appointed a special counsel. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to take to get a special counsel?\u201d demanded Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio.\u201cIt would take a factual basis that meets the standards of the appointment of a special counsel,\u201d Mr. Sessions said.Mr. Jordan raised questions about a dossier of salacious assertions about Mr. Trump prepared last year by a firm paid by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Jordan said \u201cit sure looks like\u201d the Democrats collaborated with the F.B.I. to use the dossier to persuade a secret intelligence court to issue a warrant to spy on Americans associated with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s what it looks like,\u201d Mr. Jordan said.Mr. Sessions bridled at that. \u201cI would say \u2018looks like\u2019 is not enough basis to appoint a special counsel,\u201d he retorted.Among the issues being examined, according to a Justice Department letter to the committee, is the uranium case. In 2010, Russia\u2019s atomic energy agency acquired Uranium One, a Canadian company that at the time controlled 20 percent of American uranium extraction capacity. The purchase was approved by a government committee that included representatives of nine agencies, including the State Department.To the extent that there may be legitimate questions about Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Comey, however, the credibility of any investigation presumably would be called into question should one be authorized by Mr. Sessions or his deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, because of the way it came about under pressure from Mr. Trump.Of 10 former attorneys general contacted Tuesday, only one responded to a question about what they would do in Mr. Sessions\u2019s situation.Mr. Barr said he sees more basis for investigating the uranium deal than any supposed collusion between Mr. Trump and Russia. \u201cTo the extent it is not pursuing these matters, the department is abdicating its responsibility,\u201d he said.With his job potentially on the line, Mr. Sessions has been put in the difficult position of absorbing his president\u2019s ire while safeguarding the department\u2019s traditional independence. By asking prosecutors to evaluate the evidence, he has a ready-made reason not to appoint a special counsel if they do not recommend one.\u201cI have no idea what will happen, but this letter is entirely consistent with the A.G. later saying, \u2018We followed normal process to look in to it and found nothing,\u2019\u201d said Jack L. Goldsmith, a former Justice Department official under the younger Mr. Bush. \u201cThe letter does not tip off or hint one way or another what the A.G.\u2019s decision will be.\u201dAt least one active Twitter user will be waiting for that decision.Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hundreds Arrested as Group Urges New Russian Revolution", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The police arrested more than 200 people in a roundup on Sunday that the local news media linked to an obscure right-wing movement that had been calling for a repeat of the Russian Revolution, timed near its 100th anniversary.The movement, called Artpodgotovka, or Art Preparation, had agitated in online posts for followers to prepare for revolution, but had not been widely known or taken seriously before this weekend.The tiny turnout did not seem to pose any real threat. The people who followed directions in the group\u2019s online posts and showed up at noon on Sunday on Manezh Square, in the center of Moscow, milled about in seeming confusion before officers arrested them.The movement\u2019s leader, Vyacheslav Maltsev, a video blogger based in France, had for months been posting YouTube videos calling on followers to revolt on Nov. 5. He called it \u201crevolution 2017.\u201dNov. 5 falls a day after a holiday in Russia known as Unity Day, a successor to the former Soviet celebration commemorating the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. President Vladimir V. Putin introduced the new holiday early in his term.Mr. Maltsev\u2019s planned event may have overlapped with the aftermath of protests by nationalists who have used Unity Day to stage marches against immigrants. Many nationalist activists were out on the streets over the weekend.The timing created some initial confusion over whom the police were detaining.Several dozen protesters were detained at the nationalist march on Saturday, on Unity Day, which was unrelated to Mr. Maltsev\u2019s call for revolt.It is not clear whether all of those arrested on Sunday were followers of Mr. Maltsev, or even aware of his blog posts, or had stumbled into the gatherings believing them to be a continuation of the Unity Day protests.Mr. Verkhovsky, a longtime observer of nationalist groups, said many of the same people had turned out for both events.Artpodgotovka is a nationalist and populist movement that has tried to emulate European far-right organizations. While the Kremlin has financed and is suspected of maintaining ties to European far-right parties and organizations, the arrests over the weekend underscored its scant tolerance for such groups at home.The police reported 230 arrests in Moscow on Sunday, according to the Interfax news agency. Similar gatherings took place in other Russian cities after the online posts called for supporters to come out at noon on Sunday in a main square of their city.Some in the crowd in Moscow carried knives and pistols that fire rubber bullets, which are legal in Russia for self-defense, Interfax reported.The Federal Security Service, Russia\u2019s main domestic law-enforcement agency, said in a statement on Friday it had broken up several cells of Artpodgotovka and that members had \u201cthe goal of organizing a revolution in Russia.\u201d The statement said the group planned to attack police officers, set administrative buildings on fire and create mass disturbances.In July, Russian prosecutors charged Mr. Maltsev under a law that prohibits \u201ccalls to commit extremist actions.\u201d But because the authorities have also used the law against peaceful opposition figures in recent years, the accusation drew little attention.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate, Like House, Opts to Keep Tax Break for Rich That Trump Vowed to End", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe authors of the Senate\u2019s proposed $1.5 trillion tax cut bill did no more than their House counterparts to close a contentious tax loophole favored by managers of private equity firms and some real estate ventures.Experts said the measure would not result in major changes to the tax bills of those who already benefit from the loophole.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just symbolic to say we addressed carried interest,\u201d said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting expert in New York. \u201cEveryone has looked at that proposal for about a week, and it is not going to impede or change anyone\u2019s behavior. Three years is not an unusual holding period for private equity.\u201dThe House approved the bill containing the provision Thursday.Both the House and Senate plans have been criticized for delivering substantial tax cuts to wealthy people and corporations at the expense of middle-class taxpayers, some of whom would pay more in taxes, mostly because of the elimination of certain deductions.The term carried interest essentially refers to profits reaped by private equity executives and hedge fund managers for the services they perform. At most private equity firms and hedge funds, the share of profits paid to managers is about 20 percent.It\u2019s virtually impossible to fully understand, let alone keep up with, the flood of proposals, amendments and analyses that continue to pour out. Here are some of the big-picture ideas to keep in mind as this political sausage is being made.Such profits are now taxed at a long-term capital gains rate of about 20 percent, about half the rate at which top earners\u2019 income would otherwise be taxed.Critics have argued that these executives should pay the higher rate because the profits in question are effectively income.Industry groups disagree. They argue that investment managers deserve to be taxed at the lower rate because they take entrepreneurial risks.Mr. Willens and other experts said that the proposed change could affect some hedge fund managers who typically invest for shorter periods. But for most wealthy investment managers, he said, it would not make much difference.\u201cAs a practical matter,\u201d Mr. Willens said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it will have any impact.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marty Chavez Muses on Rocky Times and the Road Ahead", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarty Chavez remembers when he went to his sister\u2019s home in San Francisco for Thanksgiving seven years ago and quickly wondered whether he shouldn\u2019t have.That was a time when having Bubonic plague seemed preferable to being a partner at Goldman Sachs.It was no fun being a Wall Street investment banker, let alone a partner at Goldman, which Matt Taibbi, at Rolling Stone, had famously branded a \u201cgreat vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.\u201dBy the time Mr. Chavez arrived in San Francisco for Thanksgiving, the anger directed at Wall Street from Main Street was palpable. During the dinner, he recounted to me recently, one guest turned to him and apropos of nothing said, \u201cMarty, how can you work for that company? How do you look at yourself in the mirror?\u201dMr. Chavez thought the comment was a \u201cwildly inappropriate topic for Thanksgiving\u201d and asked, \u201cWhat exactly do you mean?\u201d The dinner guest said, \u201cWell, Lehman,\u201d referring to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. \u201cYes, what about Lehman?\u201d Mr. Chavez replied. \u201cI don\u2019t work at Lehman.\u201dThe conversation sort of fizzled out when the man could not articulate what exactly he hated about Goldman Sachs.\u201cI took away from that, \u2018Oh, it was just in the zeitgeist at the time,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chavez said. \u201cI thought, when times are rough there seems to be a human tendency \u2014 I\u2019m sure you read \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d as a kid, right? \u2014 that if we find someone to name and shame and blame then we\u2019re good. And I think bankers have throughout history been useful in that context. This is not the first time, and I remember thinking, \u2018This too shall pass.\u2019\u201dHe was right. What a difference seven years makes. Now when he goes to San Francisco, \u201cnobody\u2019s too interested in Goldman Sachs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re much more interested in the Russian hacking of the election and all their other\u201d \u2014 and here he searches for the right word \u2014 \u201cmishegas. So times change.\u201dJust as he once told people he went to school in Boston, instead of telling them he went to Harvard, he used to tell people he worked in finance, instead of at Goldman Sachs. \u201cI don\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d he said. He said he\u2019s actually looking forward to Thanksgiving this year. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t be the center of attention,\u201d he said.Mr. Chavez is about as far from the stereotypical Wall Street senior executive as you can imagine, and that is one reason his musings about the future direction of Wall Street are listened to carefully.He grew up in Albuquerque, one of five children, who all went to Harvard. He got a doctorate in medical information sciences from Stanford University. (At that time, he was known by his full name Ramon Martin Chavez.)In 1990, Mr. Chavez came out, the day after he defended his doctoral dissertation. \u2013 \u201cArchitectures and Approximation Algorithms for Probabilistic Expert Systems.\u201d He is one of the few openly gay executives on Wall Street. He and his husband have a son courtesy of a surrogate in California. He has large Japanese language tattoos on his arms and for years had the type of un-Goldman-like beard favored by some Major League Baseball players in the postseason.He stands all day at his specially designed desk \u2013 it goes up and down at the push of a button \u2013 in his 41st-floor office that has a stunning view of New York Harbor. His energy is kinetic; he speaks quickly and passionately, moving rapidly from one arcane topic to another, such as the efficacy of judging Wall Street firms on their return on equity, a measurement of investment banking performance long favored by industry research analysts.\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s great about return on equity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt includes the notion of profit, which I think is really important.\u201dHe views his job as a simple one that is hard to get right: \u201cI\u2019m not paid or evaluated on the accuracy of my crystal-ball predictions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m paid to enumerate every possible outcome and do something about every possible outcome well in advance, when it\u2019s still possible to do something, because once it\u2019s happened it\u2019s too late.\u201dUnlike many of his peers on Wall Street, Mr. Chavez does not complain about the extent of the regulation that hit the financial industry as a result of Dodd-Frank. Generally speaking, he says, the regulations have helped banks \u201cconfront their problems and capitalize and bolster their liquidity,\u201d making them \u201cstronger as a result,\u201d and the financial system safer and more profitable.That does not mean he would not like to see some revisions on the margins. \u201cOne could ask questions all day about, well, when all these rules were enacted, did we end up with something that we didn\u2019t really desire?\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I think it\u2019s important, while asking those questions, to recognize that the rules, broadly speaking, are working. They\u2019re making the system safer and sounder, and so I sure wouldn\u2019t want anybody to throw out the baby with the bath water.\u201dHe\u2019s an advocate of \u201csome sculpting\u201d and \u201csome recalibrating\u201d of the existing rules, as the Treasury Department \u2014 in its three recent white papers \u2014 and regulators such as Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, have been hinting will occur.Instead of complaining about the extra expense and manpower required to comply with the mountain of new regulations, Mr. Chavez chooses instead to think about it differently. \u201cIf you approach the regulations as \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve got to comply,\u2019 you\u2019ll get one result,\u201d he said. He prefers thinking about the regulations as, \u201cThis makes us and the system and our clients safer and sounder, and yes it\u2019s a lot of work, but what can we learn from this work and how can we use this work in other ways to make a better result for our shareholders and our clients? Everywhere we look we\u2019re finding these opportunities and they\u2019re very much in keeping with the spirit of the times.\u201dLike any good senior Goldman executive, he does worry. (Lloyd Blankfein, the Goldman chief executive, once told me he spent 98 percent of his time worrying about things with a 2 percent probability.)His biggest concern at the moment is the risk of \u201csingle points of failure\u201d in the vast world of cybersecurity. He worries about any individual \u201crepository of information\u201d that does not have a backup and that can \u201cbe hacked.\u201dHe does not even trust Goldman\u2019s own computer system; he treats it as a potential enemy.He said what got him especially attuned to this risk was when a \u201cgroup of criminals\u201d last year managed to wire almost $100 million out of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York into the central bank of Bangladesh and from there into a casino in the Philippines \u201cand was never seen again.\u201dIt\u2019s no longer a hypothetical. \u201cIf five years ago I would have said I\u2019m really worried about someone heisting $100 million from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and wiring it to a casino in the Philippines, you would have thought that I really worry about a lot of things in a true paranoid style,\u201d he said, \u201cand then it happened.\u201d As a result, he said, Goldman has been an \u201cearly adopter\u201d of cloud services offered by a variety of third-party providers.What also makes Goldman different from its peers is the firm\u2019s love affair with engineers. At the moment, he said, engineers comprise around 30 percent of Goldman\u2019s work force of about 35,000. It\u2019s what drew him to Goldman in the first place \u2014 to work on Goldman\u2019s in-house software, \u201cSecDB,\u201d short for \u201cSecurities Database,\u201d an internal, proprietary computer system that tracks all the trades that Goldman makes and their prices, and regularly monitors the risk that the firm faces as a result.He said the system generates some million and a half points of data that were used to calculate, for the first time, the firm\u2019s \u201cliquidity coverage ratio\u201d \u2014 now 128 percent \u2014 and that were shared with regulators every day. He\u2019s been busy trying to figure out how the newly generated data can be used to help him understand what the firm\u2019s liquidity will be a year from now.That way, he said, in his principal role as Goldman\u2019s chief financial officer, he can perceive a problem in plenty of time to do something about it. \u201cWe\u2019re able to get much better actionable insights that make the firm a less risky business because we\u2019re able to go much further out into the future,\u201d he said.He spoke optimistically about Goldman\u2019s ability to rebound from the slump this year in its Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities group and said he expected that business to perform better when interest rates start fluctuating again.We\u2019ve come to the end of our 90-minute discussion \u2014 Tiffany Galvin, from the Goldman press office, was more than ready to wrap things up 45 minutes ago \u2014 and Mr. Chavez has made no mention of the firm\u2019s longstanding investment banking prowess, whether it be in advising on mergers and acquisitions or in underwriting debt and equity securities.He thinks there is nothing unusual in that, and that Sidney Weinberg, the firm\u2019s senior partner in the middle of the 20th century, would not find that omission troubling.\u201cGiven the times, and combined with the people, the brand and the culture, which I\u2019ve been part of for a longtime, that when you put all those things together,\u201d he said, \u201cit makes me super excited about the next 20 years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Post-Obama Democratic Party in Search of Itself", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "FeatureThe 44th president left office as one of the most popular in American history. He also left behind a party struggling to find an identity \u2014 and to reconnect with voters in time for the 2018 elections.Supported bySeveral members on the call later told me they expected their leader to offer some show of contrition, an inventory of mistakes made or, at minimum, an acknowledgment that responsibility for the previous night\u2019s disaster began at the top. Already, Trump\u2019s sweep of what had for years been Democratic strongholds in the Rust Belt had led to a fast-congealing belief that the party had lost touch with white working-class voters.But Pelosi sounded downright peppy on the call, noting a few vulnerable House seats that the Democrats had managed to hang onto. As for those working-class voters, \u201cTo say we don\u2019t care about them is hard to believe,\u201d Pelosi insisted, according to a transcript of the call I obtained. \u201cI have to take issue and say I don\u2019t think anybody was unaware of the anger.\u201d The Democrats weren\u2019t out of touch, she said. They just hadn\u2019t made their case clearly enough to voters \u2014 or as she put it, \u201cWe have to get out there and say it in a different way.\u201dThe discontent was palpable enough that two days after the conference call, Pelosi announced that leadership elections would be taking place less than a week later \u2014 leaving little time for a revolt to build, which some members I spoke to suspected was the point. By that time, one of Pelosi\u2019s House allies, Doris Matsui of California, had already sent out an email to all the women in the Democratic House caucus, urging them to sign on to a letter of support for Pelosi as leader. Three second-term Democrats \u2014 Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Kathleen Rice of New York and Ruben Gallego of Arizona \u2014 wrote to Pelosi, urging her to delay the elections. Rice would later tell her colleagues in a closed-door meeting, according to notes that were taken by a participant: \u201cLook, I know from losing the state attorney general race in 2010: Losing sucks. But you have to get up the next day and take responsibility for it, take a hard look at every decision your team made, figure out what went wrong and learn from it.\u201dPelosi eventually acquiesced and rescheduled the election for Nov. 30. In the end, her only opponent was Tim Ryan, a young congressman and former high school quarterback star from Ohio\u2019s 13th District, the ailing industrial region surrounding Youngstown and Akron. Ryan offered a splash-of-cold-water speech just before the vote: \u201cWe got wiped out,\u201d he said, according to a recording of his remarks. \u201cWe\u2019re toxic in the Midwest, and we\u2019re toxic in the South.\u201dIn late July, Pelosi, Bustos, Jeffries and Cicilline stood on a stage with six other Democrats under a wiltingly hot summer sky in the city park of Berryville, Va. \u2014 a town of 4,306 residents in a purple district within easy driving distance of Washington \u2014 and unveiled their new agenda, titled \u201cA Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.\u201d The phrase, which had been poll-tested by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was an intentional echo of F.D.R.\u2019s New Deal \u2014 and, less intentionally, of a Papa John\u2019s pizza slogan. But its biggest debt was to the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d and to his crimson-jowled populism.\u201cA Better Deal\u201d called for retraining in America\u2019s fading manufacturing sector, renegotiating trade deals, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and fighting the corporate consolidation that had affected the prices of everything from eyeglasses to beer. None of the 10 speakers invoked President Barack Obama. In fact, one of the key provisions in \u201cA Better Deal\u201d \u2014 renegotiating drug prices for Medicare recipients \u2014 was an implicit rebuke of the former president, who had agreed with the pharmaceutical industry to freeze Medicare drug prices in exchange for its support of the Affordable Care Act.There was a stiff-jointedness to the whole spectacle, a sense of the Democrats\u2019 trying to regain the use of muscles they had let atrophy over the previous eight years. Obama, after all, used to make this sort of thing look easy. Conflating the American story with his own \u2014 \u201cThis is who we are\u201d \u2014 the president conveyed, even in policy irresolution, an unshakable sense of his and America\u2019s place in the world. \u201cI love the guy, I miss him,\u201d Scott Peters said of Obama. \u201cBut organizationally, the party is in disarray. We\u2019re at the lowest level of elected officeholders since Hoover. We got a bit lazy and found ourselves relying on Barack Obama\u2019s charisma, and it left us in bad shape.\u201dBut the Democrats\u2019 path back from the wilderness is not a short one. No president since Ronald Reagan has won the presidency as convincingly, twice over, as Obama did \u2014 but those victories papered over an extraordinary decline in his party that became suddenly unignorable on Nov. 9, 2016. The Democratic National Committee today is an understaffed, demoralized bureaucracy. It has raised less than half of what its Republican counterpart has taken in so far this year. (Other party organizations \u2014 the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee \u2014 are faring better.)Democratic presidents have generally been less than attentive to the financial and electoral health of their party, during and after their presidencies. The Northwestern political-science professor Daniel J. Galvin writes in his 2010 book, \u201cPresidential Party Building,\u201d that since John F. Kennedy, each of them \u201cneglected, exploited or undercut his party\u2019s organizational capacities.\u201d Galvin found that this maltreatment was because such presidents had operated with \u201cdeep and durable majorities\u201d in Congress. After the Democrats lost theirs in 1994, President Bill Clinton awakened to the virtues of party-building. Galvin predicted that Obama would most likely have sufficient reason to do the same.Instead, Obama was every bit as indifferent as his predecessors. After he took office, his campaign\u2019s formidable grass-roots organization, rechristened Organizing for America, became what some party leaders complained was a \u201cshadow organization\u201d that drained resources from the D.N.C. while championing the president rather than the Democratic Party as a whole. The president did not have anywhere near the kind of close relationship with the last D.N.C. chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, that George W. Bush had with the Republican National Committee chairmen Ed Gillespie and Ken Mehlman.In 2012, Obama\u2019s campaign chose not to contribute any money to the D.S.C.C. during that cycle \u2014 and then, emerging from its victory that year with a $20 million debt, the campaign promptly offloaded it onto the D.N.C. In early 2014, Obama assured Senate Democrats that keeping the Senate majority was his \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d Months passed without any further action. Finally, two months before the midterms, Obama informed Harry Reid by phone that he was authorizing a $5 million transfer of D.N.C. funds to Senate election efforts. Reid tersely replied, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been this hard.\u201dFew of the Obama campaigns\u2019 innovations have meaningfully outlasted his presidency. Their once-pioneering digital-organizing operation, for example, went largely to ground in 2016, while the party failed to fully grasp even the basics, like the usefulness of digital advertising. \u201cWhat I can tell you,\u201d says Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, who oversaw an analysis of the party\u2019s shortcomings in the last election cycle, \u201cis that our candidates and their staff told us that the Republicans did much better digitally than we did. And they spent more than us on digital.\u201d (Teddy Goff, Obama\u2019s former digital director, says: \u201cI sincerely wish the technology built in the two Obama campaigns had been put to better use for 2016 and races down the ballot.\u201d)Organizational and technological lapses do not fully account for the Democratic Party\u2019s travails. \u201cAll that stuff is like the field-goal team,\u201d the Obama strategist David Axelrod told me. \u201cNone of it will help you if you haven\u2019t already moved 80 yards down the field. Being technologically proficient wouldn\u2019t have saved Obama if he didn\u2019t also have a consistent, compelling message.\u201dBut that message had grown threadbare by 2016. No longer was it sufficient to campaign on hope and change, or even on the president\u2019s successful efforts in 2009 to stave off a deep recession. The uneven economic recovery raised questions about the party\u2019s obliviousness to the impunity of Wall Street and the gap between the megawealthy and everyone else. Hakeem Jeffries, the New York congressman who was an author of \u201cA Better Deal,\u201d admits, \u201cWe developed a blind spot for the economic challenges that still remained unmet.\u201dRussell, now 33, had spent the past six years at the D.C.C.C. trying to help the Democrats regain the House majority that they lost to the Republicans in the 2010 midterm election. During every election cycle, political journalists and donors would file into one of the drab conference rooms inside the D.N.C. headquarters near the Capitol and watch as D.C.C.C. officials like Russell unveiled maps and polling data in support of the claim that this election cycle \u2014 unlike the last one \u2014 was going to break for the Democrats. Each time, Russell maybe half-believed it.But election night left him reeling. It wasn\u2019t just that Trump had upset Clinton \u2014 including in Russell\u2019s home state, Michigan \u2014 or that the Democrats emerged 24 seats short of a House majority. What gnawed at him was a fear that Trump might actually win over Democratic voters more lastingly. Benton Harbor, a few miles down the road from Russell\u2019s hometown in the western part of the state, lost its last Whirlpool manufacturing facility years ago. The childhood friends of his who remained in the area had renounced the Democrats and were now Trump voters. \u201cTrump could transform American politics,\u201d he remembers thinking at the time. \u201cHe could truly scramble things.\u201dLate on his last evening in Ireland, Russell was drinking a final Guinness and listening to a passable folk band at the Palace Bar in Dublin while halfheartedly scrolling through the news back home on his phone when he came across Rothenberg\u2019s column. He read through to the end with an accelerating heartbeat. It seemed big news to him that Rothenberg, a dispassionate prognosticator, had confidently issued such a prediction just 10 days into Trump\u2019s presidency.Back in Washington, Russell joined a relatively new political media consulting firm, Beacon Media, and started hunting for prospective 2018 House candidates. In early March, he traveled to California\u2019s Orange County \u2014 historically a G.O.P. stronghold, though its wealthy population included growing numbers of Asian-Americans who tended to vote Democratic. In Irvine he met with Dave Min, a wry 41-year-old law professor who had worked on the Hill as a senior policy adviser to Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, and at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.Min, the father of three young children, had never considered running for political office before. But he was also a son of Korean immigrants and was appalled by the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the United States. The incumbent congresswoman of California\u2019s 45th District, Mimi Walters, was a little-known two-term Republican who had never faced serious opposition. She had won by nearly 18 points in 2016, but Clinton beat Trump in the district by more than five points. A strong anti-Trump sentiment in 2018 could work to Min\u2019s benefit. In April, he told Russell that he was in.Russell then traveled to the Illinois suburbs just west of Chicago. Like California\u2019s 45th District, the Sixth District of Illinois had been reliably Republican for decades. But Clinton beat Trump there by seven points, and already its six-term congressman, Peter Roskam, was avoiding public appearances lest he be called upon to answer for the president. The progressive women\u2019s group Emily\u2019s List had referred Russell to Kelly Mazeski, a longtime public servant on local boards and commissions who had already decided to challenge Roskam. Mazeski was a breast-cancer survivor whose platform, she told me recently, was \u201chealth care, health care, health care.\u201d Russell helped Mazeski time her announcement for May 4, the day Roskam and his fellow House Republicans voted for a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.Scores of candidates were announcing their intentions in terrain recently considered inhospitable to Democrats: West Virginia, Texas, Kansas. Some aspirants Russell met lacked the talent to match their enthusiasm. Others were hot property and elected to go with one of Beacon Media\u2019s competitors. But by Labor Day, Russell and his firm had picked up 10 Democratic challengers. Among them were a few beguiling dark horses, like a 46-year-old physician and former Y.M.C.A. national health officer from Portage, Mich., named Matt Longjohn. Undeterred by his lack of political experience, Longjohn was challenging Fred Upton, a Republican who had represented Michigan\u2019s Sixth District for three decades.Russell himself grew up in the Sixth District and cast his first ballot as a registered voter against Upton in 2002. Back then, the incumbent seemed invincible. But now, after leading the committee that wrote the legislation seeking to eviscerate Obamacare, Upton was avoiding town halls and any other public events.Still, when I met Russell recently, his optimism was tempered by previous electoral disappointments. The Democratic Party now has more candidates than it can support, and next spring is likely to be a season of what national Democratic officials tactfully refer to as \u201cmessy primaries.\u201d And even with Trump as a foil, Russell\u2019s candidates were struggling to make a case for themselves. \u201cRight now it\u2019s such a target-rich environment for us,\u201d he told me. But \u201cwe\u2019re having trouble explaining why we\u2019re the heroes and the Republicans are the villains. At some point, our narrative will have to become more coherent than it is now.\u201dOnly two times in the last century (during the Great Depression and after the Sept. 11 attacks) has a president\u2019s party not suffered electoral losses midway into his first term. Those losses \u2014 an average of 32 House seats in each such midterm since 1862 \u2014 increase to 36 when the president\u2019s approval rating is under 50. President Trump\u2019s polling average has never once exceeded a favorability rating of 48 percent, and it now hovers at about 37 percent.Republicans are hopeful that, Trump being the exception to almost every political rule, the historical trends of wave elections will also not apply to him. \u201cClinton came up against a wave in 1994 because he had campaigned as a centrist but then led with gays in the military and Hillarycare,\u201d Karl Rove, the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, told me. \u201cThe 2006 election was a wave because Republicans were defending the Iraq war and crippled by a late-breaking ethics scandal. Democrats faced a wave in 2010 because of Obamacare. So it\u2019s been issues that have driven wave elections. This time around, I think it\u2019s more a personal antagonism to Trump. And the question is, how critical will that be in shaping the attitudes of swing voters?\u201dBut by Rove\u2019s own analysis, two of the last three wave elections were triggered by health care policies that did not approach the deep unpopularity of the G.O.P.\u2019s attempts this year to repeal or otherwise roll back Obamacare. And Trump\u2019s base cannot be counted on to prevent a wave in 2018, because a key constituency \u2014 less-educated white voters \u2014 is a group that tends not to show up during midterms. They may have even less motivation to do so next year, considering Trump\u2019s periodic denunciations of the Republican lawmakers who will need their votes.If this advice sounded familiar, it was because Emanuel advocated the same strategy a dozen years earlier, when he was trying to lift his party out of the trough it had occupied since the Newt Gingrich-led takeover of the House by the Republicans in 1994. Emanuel focused on recruiting more centrist candidates who were well liked in their districts rather than on ideological darlings of the national party. \u201cThe people who criticized me back in 2006 were from my own party,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cWhen I was recruiting candidates, I\u2019d get yelled at: \u2018Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?\u2019 It\u2019s because they were running in red districts!\u201dThe election cemented Emanuel\u2019s legend as a tactician \u2014 none of the Democrats attending the July 27 meeting expressed skepticism about his advice \u2014 but his strategy has never sat well with the party\u2019s progressive activists. \u201cI would just point to the fact that Rahm Emanuel\u2019s Democrats who won in 2006 couldn\u2019t hold those seats,\u201d Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (P.C.C.C.), which supports, trains and funds candidates, told me.She was referring to the nearly a dozen Democrats who rode the 2006 wave into Congress, only to wash back out of it with the Tea Party wave four years later. (Three more had lost in 2008.) \u201cI would suggest a counterfactual,\u201d she went on: \u201cIf we had true economic populist champions who made the case to the American people about fighting for a strong economic agenda, we might have had more lasting success.\u201d Or as the P.C.C.C.\u2019s other founder, Adam Green, put it to me: \u201cIf there\u2019s a Democratic wave in 2018, progressives won\u2019t just ride that wave \u2014 we will cause that wave.\u201dOf course, activists like Green and Taylor also vowed to be the tip of the party\u2019s spear in the previous cycle, with not much to show for it. Indeed, the Breitbart chairman and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon scornfully likens the Democrats\u2019 ideological tussles to a \u201cpillow fight,\u201d further charging that progressives will never accomplish their goals \u201cuntil they have a Breitbart on the left,\u201d he told me. \u201cOur stock in trade is going after the Republican establishment. There\u2019s no one like that on the other side.\u201dMost if not all Democrats are more than happy to watch Bannon\u2019s kamikaze antics wreak havoc on the opposition. Still, some in the party rue the lack of pugnacity on their own side. \u201cThere are two types of Democrats,\u201d David Krone, Harry Reid\u2019s former chief of staff, told me one afternoon this summer in the Midtown Manhattan office where he now works as a consultant for an investment firm. \u201cThere are killers, and there are whiners. Unfortunately, we have too many of the latter and not enough of the former.\u201dKrone considers piety an obstacle to progressive policies. \u201cDemocrats are not that pure,\u201d he told me, with a biting smile. \u201cAll those guys have a transactional component to them.\u201d Under Reid\u2019s leadership, the Democrats managed to pass important legislation like the Affordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act while also thwarting a stream of conservative bills generated by the Republican-controlled House. But it was also Reid who held his colleagues to the deal that garnered the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s support for Obamacare by agreeing to take Medicare drug prices off the table. When the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for outside-group contributions, Reid did not join the chorus of bemoaners. Instead, he ordered up a super PAC, called the Senate Majority PAC, to help keep the Senate in Democratic hands during the 2010 and 2012 cycles. \u201cReid just never pretended to be something he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Krone said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to pass health care? Fine. Don\u2019t make deals. Keep losing.\u201dIn the Democratic Killers Hall of Fame, Krone places Emanuel and Pelosi. But lately, Krone observed, the party seemed to be tilting toward the whiners \u2014 beginning with the excuses offered for Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d he said. \u201cThey freaking lost! They can blame anyone they want to, but they fail to look in the mirror.\u201dThe 2018 cycle, Krone argued, was no time for squeamishness. Again he cited the example of his former boss Reid, who, like many Democrats in 2010, was a heavy underdog going into his final Senate race. Rather than be cowed by a Republican field that, at the peak of the Tea Party movement, had been infiltrated by the party\u2019s fringe, Reid turned that to his advantage. His campaign waded into the Republican primary, targeting the most formidable G.O.P. opponents one by one until the only one left standing was Sharron Angle: a Tea Party favorite who once crusaded against water fluoridation and claimed multiple American cities were under the rule of Shariah law. Reid beat her easily.By way of contrast, Krone pointed to Russ Feingold, the Wisconsin senator who, with John McCain, was a standard-bearer for campaign-finance reform, as well as a crusader for civil liberties during the Bush years. Feingold lacked Reid\u2019s appetite for the jugular, losing to Ron Johnson in 2010 and then again in 2016. \u201cHe had his foot on Johnson\u2019s neck, and then he let up, because he was up in the polls,\u201d Krone lamented. \u201cThey don\u2019t hand out participation trophies in politics.\u201d If the party limited itself to high-minded campaigning and legislating, \u201cWe\u2019ll lose again, and Kennedy\u201d \u2014 the Supreme Court justice \u2014 \u201cwill retire, and Trump will get to appoint another conservative crazy, and the Democrats will wonder how things got to be so horrible.\u201dStill, the party faces a conundrum in its pursuit of Trump voters whose anxieties aren\u2019t just economic but cultural as well. Prevailing in some red districts may require, at minimum, tempering the party\u2019s progressivism on social issues. \u201cWhen anybody talks about a so-called litmus test for candidates, that upsets me,\u201d Representative Cheri Bustos told me. \u201cI\u2019m from Illinois, where I\u2019m the only downstate Democrat in our entire delegation. I\u2019ve been a Democrat my whole life, and my core values are very much in line with what hard-core Democrats believe. I don\u2019t ever lie about my views. However, I also don\u2019t talk about issues that are by their very nature divisive. If asked, I\u2019ll answer I\u2019m pro-choice. But then I\u2019ll get back to the economy.\u201dAdam Green of the P.C.C.C. was adamant on the prospect of anti-abortion recruits: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t welcome candidates who are pushing anti-choice policies into the big tent any more than we would welcome racists and people who want to deregulate Wall Street.\u201d Green wasn\u2019t buying the implication by Bustos and other moderates that the Democratic Party will regain a majority only if it backs away from progressive ideals. He urged me to talk to Rick Nolan, a progressive rural Minnesota congressman who, he said, \u201cwins the right way.\u201dNolan is a folksy 73-year-old journeyman politician and businessman who has long advocated a single-payer health system. He also hunts, fishes, makes his own maple syrup and in other ways stays attuned to the culture of Minnesota\u2019s Eighth District. Taking Green\u2019s advice, I asked Nolan whether he would welcome an anti-abortion candidate into the Democratic caucus. \u201cWholeheartedly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a fault today among Democrats, it\u2019s that they\u2019ve got the worst litmus test known to humankind. If we want to achieve the goals progressives want, we\u2019ve got to get back into the majority. Democrats are damned fools if they don\u2019t see that.\u201dOne rainy late summer afternoon, I met up with the ad\u2019s creator, a 42-year-old Army veteran named Bill Hyers, in a Washington hotel bar overcrowded with well-dressed young professionals. Hyers was sipping an old-fashioned when I arrived. He was dressed in a T-shirt and khaki shorts, his preferred business attire. Hyers has successfully managed the campaigns of well-established Democratic politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, and his own politics are straightforwardly liberal. At the same time, he harbors a Holden Caulfield-esque disdain of insincerity and believes that this quality, more than whining or ideological perfectionism, explains his party\u2019s state of decline.\u201cWhat\u2019s terrible about Democrats like Rahm Emanuel,\u201d Hyers said, \u201cis that it matters more to them if you\u2019re a candidate who can raise money from very wealthy people than if you have an argument to make. They look at everything through the old Clinton triangulation strategy. Put out very carefully prepared statements. Don\u2019t let anyone get to your right. Deny and ignore. Never have an honest dialogue. It was a bad strategy back in the \u201990s. But it\u2019s even worse today, because we can now have 24-7 access to candidates, and people can see when they\u2019re not being authentic. Everything Hillary Clinton did was carefully scripted \u2014 they could see that.\u201d\u201cI can only take a little credit for them,\u201d Hyers admitted after the two-and-a-half-minute ad came to an end. Bryce\u2019s and Melson\u2019s ads, he told me, had a co-producer: Matt McLaughlin, a veteran of TV advertising who \u201cdidn\u2019t know campaigns and politics, but he knows art.\u201d Hyers did not think the party\u2019s need for \u201cauthentic candidates\u201d and a little theatrical verve were incompatible. If anything, the role the confluence of those two perceived assets played in Trump\u2019s victory is one of the few inarguable lessons of the 2016 election.In mid-August, I spoke to Ian Russell\u2019s latest client, a telegenic Marine veteran and two-term state representative from Lewiston, Me., named Jared Golden.

The social-identity issues that have been emphasized in Portland don\u2019t resonate in rural Maine. It\u2019s damaged the Democratic brand here, to be honest. We\u2019re a community of hard-working people who may not be highly educated, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not intelligent. The majority of the folks here voted for Donald Trump, and I can tell you that the description of them as a basket of deplorables is just dead wrong.\u201dGolden told me that his neighbors had until recently thought of themselves as Democrats. Golden himself still is. When we spoke, he had just decided to run in Maine\u2019s Second District against the Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin. Golden would be the fifth Democrat to enter the race. He seemed to have little use for the national party\u2019s \u201cA Better Deal\u201d pitch, telling me, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than a glossy new policy document to take back the U.S. House.\u201dThe word \u201cTrump\u201d is not mentioned in the two-minute ad. Nor is the word \u201cDemocrat.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included an erroneous figure for the number of times a president\u2019s party suffered no electoral losses midway into the president\u2019s first term.

Among them are former editors at Time Inc. itself.Politico\u2019s Michael Calderone spoke to Richard Stengel, a former editor of Time, and John Huey, a former editor-in-chief of Time Inc.:One group that\u2019s not asking questions about the Meredith deal is Time Inc.\u2019s coterie of shareholders.

It\u2019s at best a bug in a complex statutory scheme, not a feature. There is simply no good structural, logical, or constitutional reason why the dead hand of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration should continue to guide the CFPB once Cordray is gone.\u201dAnalysts had long seen Meredith, which publishes Family Circle and Better Homes and Gardens, as being most interested in People, Time Inc.\u2019s most profitable title. The more news-focused publications upon which Time Inc. was built, including its namesake magazine and Fortune, have traditionally been less of a focus for Meredith.If Meredith decides to sell those news publications, who would buy them? The smart money is on a vanity buyer \u2014 perhaps from the same universe of investors who are pursuing Rolling Stone, which we hear could be sold as soon as this week.The Koch angle Take note of this disclaimer about Koch Industries\u2019 private equity arm:KED will not have a seat on the Meredith board and will have no influence on Meredith\u2019s editorial or managerial operations. KED\u2019s noncontrolling, preferred equity investment underscores a strong belief in Meredith\u2019s strength as a business operator, its strategies, and its ability to unlock significant value from the Time Inc. acquisition.The Trump angleCritics cornerIs it Leandra English, the deputy director of the bureau and the chosen successor of the now-departed chief, Rich Cordray? Or is it Mick Mulvaney, appointed by Mr. Trump to lead the agency on an interim basis?The stakes were already high. Mr. Mulvaney is on record as having called the bureau a \u201csad, sick joke,\u201d leading many to suspect that, should he take charge, would seek to unwind Obama-era initiatives meant to protect financial consumers \u2014 and that have infuriated the banking and lending industries.\u201cIf there has been one consistent criticism of the CFPB, it\u2019s a lack of predictability, and we are now left with the greatest uncertainty since the bureau was established,\u201d said Ben Olson, a Buckley Sandler lawyer and a former CFPB official who advises financial companies.That\u2019s when the Senate Budget Committee is scheduled to vote on moving the proposal to the floor.

In order to adapt, the country is trying to build rainwater cisterns and new pipe systems to ensure that its people have safe drinking water supplies.While most wealthy countries agree in principle that they should deliver more aid, the details of how to do it have been bogged down in the slow bureaucratic processes of United Nations talks.

Those records had personally identifying information blacked out, however, and the department wants to see them without redactions.In response, Mr. Waxman has raised questions about the Civil Rights Division\u2019s authority to pursue the investigation and proposed various limits on how government officials may gain access to the records, citing the privacy of applicants and concerns that the materials might become public. Mr. Donnelly in turn has accused Mr. Waxman of pursuing a \u201cstrategy of delay.\u201dThe Justice Department is weighing whether to file a friend-of-the-court brief in the Students for Fair Admissions lawsuit or whether to file its own lawsuit. If so, it could file a parallel complaint, suggesting that Harvard\u2019s policies amount to intentional discrimination, or it could file a more aggressive complaint, arguing that Harvard\u2019s policies have a \u201cdisparate impact\u201d on Asian applicants.Only the government, not private litigants, can file disparate impact claims. Such a complaint could be easier to prove because it would not be necessary to show that Harvard had a discriminatory purpose, only that its policies had a discriminatory effect.

{"Headline": "California Looks at Republican Tax Measures and Sees Payback", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The tax plan hurtling through Congress is a fast-moving blur of cuts and increases designed to keep Republicans on track to pass a bill without Democratic votes. But here in California, where several prized deductions are at risk of being eliminated, people suspect there is a greater design at play.\u201cIt really does feel like they said, \u2018What can we do to California?\u2019\u201d said Sam Moss, executive director of Mission Housing, an affordable-housing developer in San Francisco.Mr. Moss is worried about the threat to an array of tax credits and tax-exempt bonds that are widely used to build low-cost housing in a state with a severe housing shortage.And it\u2019s not only the housing incentives. The tax bills are filled with measures that Democrats, and some Republicans, say would have a disproportionate and damaging impact on an overwhelmingly Democratic state that has portrayed itself as the center of resistance to President Trump.In the sharpest example, state officials estimated that over six million California taxpayers \u2014 one of every three \u2014 take a deduction for state and local taxes. That is one of the main deductions Republicans are moving to eliminate or severely restrict. The bills would also put a ceiling on a deduction for mortgage interest used by more than four million California taxpayers, according to the State Department of Finance.The bills would phase out the ability to deduct personal casualty losses from wildfires and earthquakes \u2014 a constant threat in vast parts of the state \u2014 but keep the deduction for damage from hurricanes and floods like those in Florida and Texas this year.\u201cI would like to think that this isn\u2019t directly aimed at California, but it\u2019s hard not to think that Congress has their sights set on the Golden State,\u201d said State Senator Mike McGuire, a Democrat whose district includes areas ravaged by the recent wildfires in the north. \u201cNo matter if it\u2019s an earthquake, a wildfire or a hurricane, families should be able to deduct the damage.\u201dCalifornia is overwhelmingly Democratic. Hillary Clinton outpolled Mr. Trump by nearly four million votes here, and Democrats control both houses of the Legislature. Party leaders have been at the forefront of denouncing Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on issues from the environment to health care.There has long been concern here that the state\u2019s confrontational stance toward the Trump administration could invite retribution from Washington.Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, said in an interview that the rush by Republicans to pass a bill made it impossible to judge how much the legislation could hurt the state.\u201cI can\u2019t penetrate the inner motivations of the Republican leadership,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cBut I will say there is something very odd about their rushing this very gigantic tax proposal through Congress without serious transparency or debate. They are doing so primarily, it seems, to reward their corporate donors.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like this way to govern in a democracy,\u201d he said.Representative Darrell Issa, whose San Diego County district is among the most vulnerable Republican seats in the state, said he would oppose the bill.\u201cI cannot endorse changes that may make the tremendous burden felt by California taxpayers even worse,\u201d he said. \u201cTax reform should lower taxes for all taxpayers \u2014 regardless of where they live.\u201dBut so far, Mr. Issa\u2019s opposition appears singular within the state\u2019s Republican delegation, at least among those who will offer comment. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader, who represents a Central Valley district, strongly backed the effort. He said other parts of the bill \u2014 such as increasing the standard deduction and eliminating the alternative minimum tax \u2014 would help California taxpayers who were, he said, saddled with high state taxes.State Senator Jeff Stone, a Republican, also endorsed the effort, saying it would bring welcome relief to California taxpayers.\u201cThe Democrats keep raising taxes in California,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time the federal government stops letting them off the hook by giving them cover with an overly complicated federal tax system.\u201dOn the Democratic side, Anthony Rendon, the Assembly speaker, called the bill \u201canti-California,\u201d and said he was surprised that so few California Republicans had spoken against it, especially in contrast to Republicans in other states, like New York, that would also be hurt.\u201cIt\u2019s to a large extent political suicide for a lot of these folks,\u201d he said, \u201cand they don\u2019t seem to care.\u201dFor instance, both the House and Senate bills either reduce or repeal the deduction for state income, sales and property taxes. California\u2019s top personal income-tax rate is the nation\u2019s highest.The House bill lowered the limit on the mortgage-interest deduction for new home purchases from $1 million in debt to $500,000. That move would affect fewer than 3 percent of mortgage holders nationally, and there are only four metropolitan areas in the United States where more than half of the homes are priced above $500,000. All four are in California. (The Senate bill keeps the limit at $1 million.)Also, no state benefits more from itemized deductions, which the bills limit, and in many cases discourage, by increasing the standard deduction. Economic models suggest that the bulk of the millions of families that would face tax increases under the legislation itemize their deductions.More than a third of Californians itemize their deductions, according to data compiled by the Pew Charitable Trusts; the average benefit from those deductions was nearly $37,000 in 2015.California is not the only state whose voters would lose deductions from the tax bill. According to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, an independent think tank, six states \u2014 California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas and Pennsylvania \u2014 claim more than half of the total amount deducted for state and local taxes.Conor Dougherty reported from San Francisco, and Adam Nagourney from Los Angeles.

{"Headline": "Park Lane Hotel Draws No Bids Near $1 Billion Price", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat if they held an auction and nobody bid?Last week, offers were due in the auction of the 47-story Park Lane Hotel on Central Park South, which sits on what the seller argues is one of the best locations in the world, a stretch of Midtown Manhattan that has become known as Billionaires\u2019 Row. It came with development rights that would allow a new owner to build a taller, sleeker skyscraper with ever more expensive apartments offering unobstructed views of Central Park.\u201cNo bids came in,\u201d or at least none that came anywhere near the $1 billion the seller was looking for, according to three people who had been briefed on the auction but were not authorized to discuss it.\u201cI think it\u2019s the world\u2019s greatest site for development,\u201d said Jeffrey Davis, director of the hotels and hospitality group at JLL, a real estate firm not involved in the sale. \u201cThe problem was timing.\u201dBut the Park Lane also comes with a very complicated back story.The whereabouts of Mr. Low, whose friends included movie stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, Wall Street bankers and heads of state, are unknown.But the Justice Department initiated a civil forfeiture action in 2016 to seize many of the assets purchased in the course of the fraud, including the Park Lane.Mr. Witkoff and his partners \u2014 the developer Harry Macklowe and the investment firms New Valley L.L.C. and Highgate Holdings \u2014 bought the hotel in an auction in 2013, paying $654 million, of which they put up 15 percent.Mr. Low initially agreed to put up the remaining 85 percent, including a $100 million nonrefundable deposit. At the last minute, however, Mr. Low took a 55 percent stake in the building and brought in Mubadala Investment Company, a fund based in Abu Dhabi, for the final 30 percent.Their plan was to raze the Park Lane and erect an undulating glass tower designed by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron that would rise 855 feet, using development rights from adjoining properties. Every apartment would have views of Central Park, and the five penthouses would have outdoor swimming pools on the exterior galleries.With developers erecting super-tall luxury towers with $100 million penthouses on nearby 57th Street, the Park Lane project, known as 38 Central Park South, looked like the next big thing.But in July 2016, Mr. Low failed to put up his share of a loan payment on the Park Lane mortgage. Almost simultaneously, the Justice Department filed a civil complaint seeking to recover more than $1 billion in assets. Nearly a year later, Mr. Witkoff worked out an agreement with federal prosecutors to sell the Park Lane.In the intervening time, the red-hot real estate market, including condo sales at the new towers along Billionaires\u2019 Row, slowed. With new ultra luxury buildings continuing to open, lenders today are reluctant to finance new projects.Potential buyers could continue to operate the Park Lane as a hotel. Its 628 rooms are often sold out. And the hotel\u2019s location opposite Central Park, between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, remains highly prized. The owners have claimed that the hotel generates enough revenue to pay its $480 million mortgage.But real estate experts say potential buyers could be nervous about the continuing role of the Justice Department, and there is a widespread sense that the market for hotels has cooled.\u201cNo one wants to be the last to buy a hotel in this cycle,\u201d said Chad Crandell, chief executive of CHMWarnick, which oversees hotels owned by Asian and Middle Eastern companies, including Anbang Insurance, the Chinese company that paid $1.95 billion for the Waldorf in 2014.The booming real estate market had been fueled in part by foreign investors, particularly those from China and the Middle East, who regard New York as a safe haven amid turmoil in the rest of the world.\u201cThe whole transaction market has softened,\u201d Mr. Crandell said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty.\u201dHotel prices in particular peaked in 2015, when the South Korean Lotte Group paid $805 million for the New York Palace and China\u2019s Sunshine Insurance Group paid more than $230 million for the lavish 114-room Baccarat Hotel on West 53rd Street, setting a record for price per room.\u201cThe Park Lane\u2019s a victim not of pricing or location, but purely of timing,\u201d said Mr. Davis. \u201cAnd that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rebuild New York Subways Under New Leadership, Report Urges", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixing New York City\u2019s subway crisis will require taking the drastic step of creating a state-controlled corporation dedicated solely to rebuilding and modernizing the city\u2019s teetering subway system, according to a new report from an influential urban research and advocacy group.The subways are currently operated and financed by the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees a sprawling network of subways, buses, railroads, bridges and tunnels. The report described the authority as \u201can enormous legacy institution\u201d hobbled by competing internal priorities, bureaucratic rules and practices, and a lack of funding. As a result, the report said, it has been too slow to make improvements and adopt modern technology, leaving a backlog of critical infrastructure projects.One of the group\u2019s boldest suggestions takes aim at one of the subway\u2019s most cherished qualities \u2014 that it never closes. The association said the subway should be shut down in the wee hours to more rapidly fix what is broken and add the upgrades that are sorely needed.The report took five years to produce and aims to provide a comprehensive blueprint for the future. It is only the fourth such report to be released by the association in nearly a century. Three previous reports \u2014 in 1929, 1968 and 1996 \u2014 helped lay the groundwork for public works projects, including bridges and highways, economic development, and preservation of parkland and open space. The 1996 report called for building a Second Avenue subway and creating a business district on the Far West Side of Manhattan, both of which are now a reality.The fourth report looks broadly at the transportation system in the New York region, saying its failures are the consequence of years of underinvestment even as demand for services grew and advancing technology raised customer expectations. It proposes building a second bus terminal under the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on Manhattan\u2019s West Side to consolidate intercity buses and free up space at the crowded Port Authority Bus Terminal, and expanding subway and regional rail service and connections.Though the report acknowledged that the authority has managed to rescue the subway from past crises, it contends that the authority is no longer up to the job. \u201cThe M.T.A., as currently funded and structured, cannot keep up,\u201d the report said. \u201cUnless we can find new ways to deliver improvements and modernization, the subway system will continue to slip further behind.\u201dIn response to the report, Joseph J. Lhota, the transportation authority\u2019s chairman, said in a statement: \u201cWhile we don\u2019t need to create a new bureaucratic structure, we agree that securing a dedicated revenue source \u2014 preferably one that also battles congestion \u2014 is essential.\u201dMr. Rechler said a more efficient and focused organization was vital to lead the subway overhaul. While details would be worked out later, he said that the new subway corporation could operate with more flexibility than traditional government agencies, which are often bound by outdated rules and regulations.\u201cWe\u2019re asking the public for a multibillion-dollar commitment to get this done,\u201d Mr. Rechler said. \u201cI think it\u2019s critical that it goes into an organization that is designed to solely execute on this mission.\u201dThe report\u2019s to-do list for the subways includes building new subway lines to underserved areas and reducing crowding at stations by creating larger entrances, enlarging corridors and mezzanines, and moving nonessential structures such as newsstands from platforms. It also advocates increasing access for riders with disabilities and making subway stations more bearable through better ventilation and more natural light. Though the authority has already started to make some improvements, such as updating signals, the report said the pace is so slow it could take decades to finish.The report calls for closing the 24-hour subway system in the early morning hours during the week for routine maintenance and increasing bus service as an alternative. An average of 85,000 riders are on the subways between 12:30 a.m. and 5 a.m., or just 1.5 percent of the total daily ridership, according to the report.It also recommends taking advantage of longer closings of subway lines not only to make necessary repairs but also to focus on enhancements like power and track upgrades. Tom Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, pointed to the L train tunnel between Brooklyn and Manhattan, which will close in 2019 to repair damage caused by Hurricane Sandy.\u201cIt makes sense for the M.T.A. to shut the L train down for 15 months, but they need to deliver a better system when it reopens so riders see the benefits and will support more lines undergoing similar treatments,\u201d Mr. Wright said.Denise Richardson, the executive director of the General Contractors Association of New York, an industry group representing contractors involved in public works projects, said more can get done if they are not trying to work piecemeal around existing service. When the Montague Street subway tunnel linking Brooklyn and Manhattan was shut down in 2013 for Sandy-related repairs, it reopened the next year \u2014 ahead of schedule and on budget, said Ms. Richardson, who is a member of the Regional Plan Association\u2019s board.\u201cWe saw a greater level of efficiency and ability to get projects done,\u201d she said.For riders, a dedicated subway corporation could bring faster relief from the constant delays and overstuffed subways.\u201cThe key to repairing the subway is creating a sense of urgency and accountability, not just for Governor Cuomo but also for the governors who come after him,\u201d said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Coup, Even Mugabe\u2019s Own Party Is Dumping Him", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 Zimbabwe\u2019s governing party moved on Friday to expel President Robert Mugabe from its ranks, taking the first step in legally ousting the 93-year-old leader following a military intervention two days earlier.A majority of the leaders of the party, ZANU-PF, recommended Mr. Mugabe\u2019s expulsion from the very organization that he had controlled with an iron grip since independence in 1980, according to ZBC, the state broadcaster.Military officers have insisted that their takeover was not a coup, but the party\u2019s leaders appeared on Friday to be providing political cover for the intervention. The party\u2019s central committee, Parliament and Mr. Mugabe\u2019s cabinet could now take steps to officially end his presidency, if he does not resign.The military arrested Mr. Mugabe early Wednesday, effectively ending his 37-year rule, although it allowed him to appear in public on Friday to address a university graduation.Later on Friday, party members endorsed the military\u2019s efforts to stabilize the economy and defuse political instability. They echoed military commanders in arguing that the intervention was aimed at rooting out a cabal of corrupt interlopers who had clouded Mr. Mugabe\u2019s judgment and his ability to govern.\u201cMany of us had watched with pain as the party and government were being reduced to the personal property of a few infiltrators with traitorous histories and questionable commitment to the people of Zimbabwe,\u201d the party leaders said in a resolution. \u201cClearly, the country was going down the wrong path.\u201dOver the past few days, the military has been in negotiations to find a peaceful and face-saving way for Mr. Mugabe to exit the scene, in talks mediated by South Africa and other countries in the region, and by the Roman Catholic Church.Mr. Mugabe, 93, has dominated his country since independence from Britain 37 years ago, surviving through a blend of political skill, brutality, manipulation and patronage dispensed among a corrupt elite.Those days \u201care numbered,\u201d though, said Chris Mutsvangwa, the leader of Zimbabwe\u2019s influential war veterans\u2019 movement, which was founded to represent those who fought in the seven-year liberation war in the 1970s but has emerged as a powerful political force.At a news conference, Mr. Mutsvangwa cranked up pressure on Mr. Mugabe, saying the longtime leader would face huge calls for his ouster at a rally on Saturday.At his news conference, Mr. Mutsvangwa said several key regions in Zimbabwe\u2019s Shona-speaking heartlands \u2014 the base of ZANU-PF\u2019s support \u2014 had approved calls for the president\u2019s expulsion. Mr. Mugabe himself has in the past used orchestrated maneuvering in the provinces to undermine national figures in Harare.The talks involving the Catholic Church and South African mediators are intended to devise some form of transition that would have the appearance of constitutional legitimacy while providing a decorous departure for a leader whose role in the pre-independence liberation struggle is central to the national narrative.The military\u2019s ultimate intention has apparently been to effect a transfer of power without the appearance of illegality that might draw further opprobrium from outside Zimbabwe or frighten off potential investors.\u201cThe army is trying to keep people guessing\u201d while talks continue, said Frank Chikowore, a Zimbabwean journalist.The ZANU-PF resolution on Friday singled out the G-40, a faction of politicians aligned with Mr. Mugabe\u2019s wife, Grace Mugabe. It denounced four of them as \u201ccriminals and counterrevolutionaries\u201d: Jonathan N. Moyo, the minister of higher education; Ignatius M. Chombo, the finance minister; Saviour Kasukuwere, minister for local government; and Patrick Zhuwao, the minister for public services, labor and social welfare.Outside the main cities on Friday, the military set up roadblocks on main highways, apparently to thwart any attempt at organized resistance. Buses traveling from Bulawayo, the second city, to Harare, the capital, were pulled over and boarded by soldiers who checked documents and asked passengers about their business. Sometimes, travelers reported, the soldiers ordered passengers off the buses for inspection. Some were asked if they were carrying weapons.Such was the official concern to maintain an appearance of normalcy that the state broadcaster devoted the first 10 minutes of its news bulletin on Thursday to interviews with people across the land and, as if scripted, all repeated the same refrain: \u201cIt\u2019s business as usual.\u201d Mr. Mugabe\u2019s appearance at the graduation ceremony \u2014 however surreal \u2014 seemed to be part of the same stratagem.Some Zimbabweans suggested that the officers\u2019 calculation might offer Mr. Mugabe a chance to play hardball in closed-door talks.In the annals of Africa\u2019s many uprisings and coups, the script often involves the strongman fleeing into exile or being imprisoned or even shot.Instead, Zimbabwe\u2019s military allowed Mr. Mugabe to return to State House, his official residence, and on Friday, he appeared in a bright blue cap and gown, under tight security, to oversee the graduation ceremony in Harare. At one point, he appeared to doze, his head lolling.By appearing at the ceremony, Mr. Mugabe wanted to give \u201cthe impression that he is still in charge,\u201d Mr. Mutsvangwa said. \u201cHe is finished.\u201d\u201cHe is defying the population, trying to give a semblance of normality when things are not normal,\u201d Mr. Mutsvangwa said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are saying: Don\u2019t lie to yourself; it\u2019s a delusion. You know he has been deluding himself \u2014 he is deluded.\u201dMr. Mugabe \u2014 in official portrayals at least \u2014 has maintained power as an enduring emblem of the fight to expunge colonial influence in Africa.But he has presided over a precipitous economic decline that began with the seizing of white-owned farms starting in 2000. Joblessness has soared, and a shortage of foreign currency has driven up the price of imports. At the same time, a loyal elite around him has amassed villas, farms and high-end automobiles.Jeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Alan Cowell from London.Advertisement"}

Said to Be Backed by Koch Brothers", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTime Inc. is said to be in talks to sell itself to the Meredith Corporation, in a deal backed by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire brothers known for supporting conservative causes.Talks between Time Inc., the publisher of Time and People, and Meredith, the publisher of Family Circle and Better Homes and Gardens, fizzled this year. The new round of negotiations, motivated by the surprise entry of the Kochs, could lead to a quick deal, according to people involved in the discussions.The Kochs have tentatively agreed to back Meredith\u2019s offer with an equity injection of more than $500 million, the people with knowledge of the talks said. A spokesman for the brothers\u2019 business, Koch Industries, declined to comment on Wednesday.Time Inc. also declined to comment. Meredith did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The companies have been negotiating over the past several days, and Meredith is reviewing the latest Time Inc. financial information.Although it is unclear whether the proposed deal will reach fruition, both sides hope to move quickly enough to be able to announce a transaction soon after Thanksgiving.The talks are part of the third known attempt by Meredith to purchase Time Inc. In 2013, a deal collapsed when the two publishers could not agree on which magazines Meredith would buy. At the time, Meredith reportedly did not want to acquire four of Time Inc.\u2019s best known titles: Time, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated.Earlier this year, Meredith was said to have been among parties interested in buying Time Inc. Those discussions ended when Time Inc. said it did not want to sell itself.An obstacle that stalled negotiations earlier this year was Meredith\u2019s inability to secure sufficient financing from banks. With the addition of the Kochs, with their deep pockets and apparent desire to make themselves players on the media landscape, that problem could vanish.It is not clear how much influence \u2014 if any \u2014 the Kochs would have on a Meredith-owned Time Inc. if the deal were to go through.The discussions come during a challenging time for magazine publishers, many of which are trying to remake themselves as multimedia entities. Time Inc. has lately shifted its focus away from its print magazines as it seeks to attract a sizable digital audience and pursue new opportunities for revenue growth.The latest talks between Meredith and Time Inc. show the Koch brothers\u2019 willingness to give their media ambitions another shot after they explored purchasing the Tribune Company in 2013.Founded in 1922 by Henry R. Luce, Time Inc. was at one point among the most influential and authoritative voices in American magazine publishing, with offices overlooking Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. Through Time and Life magazines, it chronicled the ups and downs of a nation through stellar photography and weekly updates on news, sports and culture.Charles and David Koch have made hefty donations to various civic and arts organizations, including Lincoln Center, the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Longtime libertarians, they are also prominent backers of conservative causes and candidates. In 1979, David Koch ran as the vice-presidential candidate on the 1980 Libertarian ticket (with Ed Clark at the top of the ticket).The brothers have continued to influence politics through a Koch-funded nonprofit conservative advocacy group founded in 2004, Americans for Prosperity. In the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, the group spent more than $720 million to bolster conservative policy positions and candidates.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the speaker at an Americans for Prosperity event in August. It was Wilbur L. Ross, the commerce secretary, not Vice President Mike Pence.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Growing Call to Limit Lawyers\u2019 Donations to Prosecutors", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMinutes after winning re-election to a third term as Manhattan district attorney last week, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a celebratory drink in hand, was asked how he would rebuild the trust of voters angry about large donations to his campaign from defense lawyers with cases before his office.\u201cIt\u2019s very important that we address this public concern,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will. We will institute sensible, progressive and effective fund-raising policies and limits.\u201dMuch had changed in Mr. Vance\u2019s world since his campaign sent out an invitation last May for his last big fund-raiser, a \u201cWomen for Cy\u201d luncheon.Mixed in among the boldface names of politicians, actors, socialites and real estate developers on the host committee were two criminal defense lawyers who often represent people in Manhattan.So fierce was the public reaction that two write-in candidates jumped into the race and took a combined 9 percent of the vote \u2014 some 18,000 protest votes that marred what was supposed to be an unopposed glide to re-election.In the United States, local prosecutors wield immense power over the fate of defendants. Nine of 10 cases are resolved through plea bargains, and prosecutors negotiate the terms almost entirely out of the public eye. They decide whether to bring a case or drop charges, to charge a misdemeanor or a felony, to demand prison or accept probation.Yet in all but three states prosecutors are also elected officials. About 2,300 prosecutors across the country must raise money for campaigns, opening them up to charges of favoritism toward contributors. What\u2019s more, most prosecutors serve multiple terms, and they run unopposed for re-election more than 80 percent of the time, academic studies have shown. One reason is that few criminal defense lawyers are willing to risk alienating them with a political challenge.In New York, donations from defense lawyers have been a questionable, albeit legal, feature of the campaign financing system for decades, lawyers said.\u201cIt\u2019s a definite problem \u2014 it looks bad,\u201d said Michael G. Cherkasky, a former high-ranking Manhattan prosecutor who was Mr. Vance\u2019s finance chairman in 2009. \u201cWe also live in a practical world. It\u2019s the only way you are going to raise money and get elected unless you happen to be so wealthy you can self-fund.\u201d\u201cThis is not unique to Vance at all,\u201d said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York. \u201cIf you dig into campaign contributions for virtually any district attorney, you are going to find contributions from defense attorneys, law firms and bail bondsmen.\u201dYet defense lawyers and former prosecutors say the issue is not cut-and-dried. Banning donations raises questions about the free speech rights of lawyers. In addition, they say, a ban on such donations might also sharply curb who can afford to run, limiting it to the rich.What\u2019s more, lawyers and prosecutors say, few people outside legal circles pay attention to district attorney races or know anything about a candidate\u2019s abilities as a lawyer. Most candidates are either former prosecutors or defense lawyers who draw their initial support from fellow lawyers.As county officials, district attorneys are not bound by city campaign finance laws. In Manhattan, an individual can donate close to $57,000 in an election cycle, a cap calculated based on the county\u2019s population.Mr. Vance established a vetting system to ensure his prosecutors were not aware of campaign donations and to weed out gifts from defendants and victims involved in pending cases, his aides said. But when it came to defense lawyers, a senior official in his office made a case-by-case decision about whether the donation created a conflict of interest and should be returned.About 40 percent of Mr. Vance\u2019s $6.1 million in contributions came from lawyers. Many of the biggest givers are not criminal defense lawyers who practice in Manhattan, but financiers and business leaders like Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of MacAndrews & Forbes Inc. Others were prominent litigators and corporate lawyers, like David Boies, the Democratic Party stalwart who argued for marriage equality before the United States Supreme Court.Since 2009, Mr. Vance\u2019s campaign coffers have received at least $300,000 from lawyers and law firms who regularly represent criminal clients in Manhattan, according to campaign disclosure reports.Mr. Vance firmly denies contributions affected his decision-making on any case, but he acknowledges they may have tainted public confidence in his independence.One possible reform would be to put a low cap on the contributions from lawyers who represent criminal defendants in Manhattan, just as city election laws cap donations from people who do business with the city. Assemblyman Quart\u2019s bill would take that approach. A second idea is to establish public financing for prosecutor\u2019s races. A more extreme solution would be to establish a system of appointed prosecutors, as is done in Connecticut, New Jersey and Alaska.Stephen Gillers, a professor who studies legal ethics at New York University School of Law, said under the current system, the only check that keeps elected prosecutors from playing favorites is the ballot box.\u201cYou are relying on the district attorney\u2019s integrity and the risk of losing the next election,\u201d he said.Some lawyers said privately they gave money in the hope it would make it easier to get a meeting with a supervisor, or with Mr. Vance himself, if they could not negotiate a plea with the trial-level assistant district attorney. Such meetings can be critical in their line of work, since most cases never go to trial.Yet Mr. Vance says donations do not buy access. He is willing to hear from any defense lawyer with a legitimate argument to make, regardless of the lawyer\u2019s political leanings, he said. \u201cI meet with scores of lawyers at various stages,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Several defense lawyers who have given generously to Mr. Vance\u2019s campaign rejected the notion their money could sway a case\u2019s outcome. Indeed, several of Mr. Vance\u2019s friends and campaign contributors recalled times he had rejected their arguments for leniency on behalf of a client.\u201cThere are all these cases where defendants get unfavorable treatment and their lawyers contributed, and all these cases where the defendant gets favorable treatment and their lawyers didn\u2019t contribute a dime,\u201d said Mr. Alonso, Mr. Vance\u2019s former chief assistant.Elkan Abramowitz, who is Mr. Vance\u2019s former law partner, said he has had cases go both ways, despite being a major financial supporter of Mr. Vance since his first campaign in 2009, personally donating $26,000 over the years. (His firm and partners have given another $62,000.)In recent years, Mr. Abramowitz has represented two high-profile defendants in dealings with Mr. Vance\u2019s office. In one case, he persuaded Mr. Vance\u2019s team not to prosecute Harvey Weinstein in the alleged groping of an Italian model, after pointing out she had given shifting accounts about a previous sexual assault allegation.In the other, Mr. Abramowitz failed to persuade Mr. Vance to drop a prosecution of Stephen H. Davis, the former chairman of the Dewey & LeBoeuf law firm, on fraud charges.\u201cHe turned me down,\u201d Mr. Abramowitz recalled.Another longtime supporter of Mr. Vance is Isabelle A. Kirshner, who started with him in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office in the early 1980s.Officials in the district attorney\u2019s office said Mr. Vance\u2019s chief assistant, Karen Friedman-Agnifilo, met with Ms. Kirshner and insisted the doctor plead guilty to a felony as part of any deal, overruling a lower level assistant who had agreed to a lesser charge.Ms. Kirshner said she makes it a point never to discuss her cases with Mr. Vance himself. \u201cI have never seen any evidence of my contributions having assisted me in resolving matters,\u201d she said. The resolution of the doctor\u2019s case, she said, came after months of negotiations during which she pointed out problems with the evidence against her client.\u201cYou don\u2019t get what is perceived to be this golden deal because you go in and you ask nicely and say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a friend of Cy\u2019s,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt did not work like that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Revolution at Etsy", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe first time Josh Silverman addressed the staff of Etsy as their newly installed chief executive, he tried to connect with a work force known for its diversity, idealism and sincerity.\u201cHello,\u201d he said. \u201cMy name is Josh. I identify as male. My preferred pronouns are \u2018him\u2019 and \u2018he.\u2019 Most people just call me Josh.\u201dIt was May 3, and Mr. Silverman was speaking to a roomful of traumatized employees. The day before, Etsy had fired 80 people, the first big layoffs at the online marketplace for handmade and vintage arts and crafts. Among those ousted was Etsy\u2019s beloved chief executive of six years, Chad Dickerson.Now Mr. Silverman \u2014 an Etsy board member but an unknown to most employees \u2014 stood in the Etsytorium, trying to win over a hostile crowd. His earnest introduction was an olive branch of sorts, an effort to signal that he was attuned to Etsy\u2019s vibrant gay and transgender community, and would be respectful of the company\u2019s distinctive culture. But to many in attendance, his remarks came off as tone deaf, and his inability to read the room foreshadowed sweeping changes that would soon transform Etsy.On the same day as the chief executive changeover, the company announced its first layoffs. Within weeks of assuming control, Mr. Silverman shut down several projects that had been in the works for months. Not long after that, he fired another 140 employees.It was a dizzying series of events at a company that has long held itself up as a paragon of righteous business practices. Etsy\u2019s founders believed its business model \u2014 helping mostly female entrepreneurs make a living online \u2014 was inherently just. Employees shared their emotions freely, often crying at the office. Perks included generous paid parental leave, free organic food and a pet-friendly workplace. Etsy was certified as a B Corp by a nonprofit called B Lab, denoting its particularly high social and environmental standards.But once Etsy went public in 2015, it was evaluated just like any other company traded on the stock market. By late last year, expenses were growing fast. And even as the company reported $88 million in revenues during the third quarter, it posted a net loss of $2.5 million. After a few quarters of tepid results, investors grew impatient and a classic clash of corporate governance came spilling into view \u2014 how would a company like Etsy balance the short-term demands of its shareholders with its high-minded long-term mission?By some important metrics, Etsy appears to be improving under Mr. Silverman\u2019s leadership. Revenues are up, as are \u201cgross merchandise sales\u201d \u2014 the total value of goods being sold on Etsy. The company\u2019s stock has risen about 50 percent in the six months since he took over.By other measures, however, Etsy is barely recognizable. The \u201cValues-Aligned Business\u201d team, which oversaw the company\u2019s social and environmental efforts, was dismantled. A new focus on profitability has sapped many employees of their enthusiasm. A workplace that once encouraged workers to express their feelings has clammed up. Etsy is no longer a B Corp.Today, as Mr. Silverman continues to push for change and investors keep close watch on the stock, what\u2019s most frustrating to some close observers of the company is that Etsy seems to have given up so much to gain so little.As Etsy grew, it eschewed traditional corporate customs in favor of a more freewheeling approach. Building consensus was more important than moving fast. Employees believed Etsy could be equally beneficial to buyers, sellers, staff and the planet. The idealism was infectious, and many people turned down higher salaries from other companies to work for Etsy.Yet for all its efforts to stand apart, Etsy followed the established playbook when it came to financing its growth. Venture capitalists poured some $85 million into the company, making a takeover or initial public offering all but inevitable.In 2011, the board decided to replace Mr. Kalin with Mr. Dickerson, who was then the chief technology officer. As C.E.O., Mr. Dickerson oversaw dramatic growth. When he took Etsy public in 2015, the company had 1.4 million active sellers, nearly 20 million buyers and had gross merchandise sales of $2 billion a year.True to form, Etsy found ways to make its initial public offering inclusive. It marketed shares to small investors and Etsy sellers and tried to concentrate shares in a smaller than usual number of institutional holders. Besides upholding the company\u2019s egalitarian ethos, the effort had a strategic rationale. The hope was that such a shareholder base might insulate Etsy from some of the short-term pressures of the stock market.Yet even as Etsy grew to number more than 1,000 staffers, the company\u2019s unorthodox culture survived. Mr. Dickerson held weekly \u201cOffice Hours,\u201d when any employee could ask him about anything, and spoke openly about his doubts, admitting when he didn\u2019t know the answer to a question.The emotional, individualistic culture had its drawbacks. The emphasis on go-it-alone craftsmanship meant Etsy managed its own data centers, instead of using more efficient options like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. With everyone empowered to express themselves, there was a lot of sharing going on. Inboxes were stuffed with unnecessary emails, which dragged on productivity.Mr. Silverman said he came to his first board meeting prepared to listen. But in the Etsy boardroom, seated around a large custom-made table featuring gold inlay, a large owl sculpture looming over the directors, he said he was troubled by what he heard from Mr. Dickerson. Expenses were growing faster than revenues. Sales on the site were up, but the rate of growth was slowing.As Mr. Dickerson tried to move the meeting on to topics including international expansion, Mr. Silverman spoke up. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re big at all,\u201d he told the board. \u201cWe\u2019re at the early stages.\u201dMr. Silverman pressed Mr. Dickerson to get more aggressive about the rate of growth, and called for a renewed focus on increasing sales. Privately, he came away concerned about the company\u2019s trajectory. \u201cThere was not a sense of crisis,\u201d Mr. Silverman said.\u201cThe house was burning and nobody was paying attention,\u201d said Fred Wilson, the co-founder of Union Square Ventures, which was an early investor in Etsy, and the board chairman. \u201cChad got the company about as far as he was going to get it. We needed somebody to take it to the next level.\u201dInstead of the soft skills that Mr. Dickerson brought, the board wanted someone with experience in marketing, software and e-commerce, someone who was comfortable at a big public company. In other words, someone like Mr. Silverman.At 4 p.m. on Tuesday, May 2, Mr. Dickerson called an emergency meeting in the Etsytorium, a cavernous conference room inside headquarters. Usually a loose public speaker, Mr. Dickerson read from a script, his voice shaking as he made an announcement: He was laying off 80 employees \u2014 the largest cuts in Etsy\u2019s history. And, he said, he had been fired by the board.Mr. Dickerson broke into tears, and sat down to steady himself. Many in the audience openly wept.Mr. Dickerson had learned that he was being replaced only days earlier, and his termination was effective immediately. Even by the unsentimental standards of corporate America, it was an abrupt transition. That night, a large contingent went drinking at local beer garden.The next morning, Mr. Dickerson, Mr. Silverman and Mr. Wilson all addressed the company. Mr. Dickerson told the crowd he was hung over. Mr. Wilson made some perfunctory remarks. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to blame anyone for this decision, I want you to blame me,\u201d he said.Finally, Mr. Silverman took the microphone, addressing his new staff for the first time. After introducing himself (and noting his gender), Mr. Silverman spoke about his background and experience. He said he wanted to preserve what was best about Etsy and help the company grow.When he began taking questions, the room turned hostile.\u201cYesterday felt impersonal, unempathetic and decidedly un-Etsy,\u201d the first employee said, according to a recording of the meeting. \u201cWhat is the new leadership planning to do to earn our trust and maintain the empathetic and human culture that is the entire reason that many of us chose to work here?\u201d\u201cTrust is earned, not granted,\u201d Mr. Silverman replied. \u201cKeep an open mind, and we\u2019ll get to know each other.\u201dEmployees saw Mr. Dickerson one last time. The next Friday, he came back to the office to give a Last Lecture, a traditional Etsy send-off. Mr. Dickerson spoke openly about his personal life and his time with Etsy. Everybody cried.Mr. Silverman wasted no time making changes. His sole focus, he said, was speeding up the pace of sales growth.He identified 30 projects that had the best chance of boosting sales on the site. Etsy began giving buyers more assurances, telling them that it didn\u2019t share credit card information with sellers, and that the company would refund their purchases if something went wrong. It began encouraging sellers to compare prices before listing an item. And for the first time, Etsy is running sales and promoting the holidays. Each of these changes, Mr. Silverman said, resulted in modest but measurable sales increases.Not everything worked. A move to display all-inclusive pricing, instead of the cost of the good and shipping separately, hurt sales and upset sellers. And a new way of displaying search filters didn\u2019t move the needle. \u201cMore than half of the things we try don\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying things.\u201dOther projects were shut down. Etsy Studio, a new marketplace for arts and crafts supplies that had consumed significant resources, was sidelined. Plans for further international expansion were put on hold. A marketing campaign was scrapped.At the same time, Mr. Silverman began redrawing what he said was a convoluted organizational chart. Too many people were managers, he said, and too many managers had too few reports. On June 21, less than two months after taking over, Mr. Silverman announced another, larger round of layoffs.Despite the tumult, Mr. Silverman said progress was being made as small tweaks to the site began to pay off. \u201cWe subtracted people and we\u2019re getting a lot more done,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more focus, a lot more urgency.\u201dSeveral current Etsy employees said they appreciated a new sense of direction and accountability, and that the company was becoming more innovative. \u201cThe tolerance for risk has gone up significantly,\u201d said Linda Kozlowski, the chief operating officer. \u201cThere\u2019s been a cultural shift of accountability in a good way.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re doing their best to mimic eBay and Amazon,\u201d said Amy Stringer-Mowat, co-founder of American Heirloom, a Brooklyn company that makes customized bamboo cutting boards. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bite the hand that feeds you, but that\u2019s the best way to describe how I feel about what\u2019s going on.\u201dMs. Stringer-Mowat\u2019s company got started on Etsy, but she said sales on the site have slumped in recent months. She stopped hearing from Etsy employees in the marketing department who had helped her promote her business, and she said Etsy was pressuring her to offer cheaper shipping rates, which cuts into her profits.Mr. Silverman insists Etsy is still a mission-driven company. Many of the perks remain in place, and the company is lobbying in Washington, including for the protection of net neutrality. But Mr. Silverman says Etsy\u2019s greatest potential for impact is helping sellers \u2014 many of whom are women running small businesses \u2014 increase their sales. \u201cThe company had the best of intentions, but wasn\u2019t great at tying that to impact,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cBeing good doesn\u2019t cut the mustard.\u201dOn the afternoon of Nov. 6, Etsy reported strong quarterly earnings. Sales, revenues and adjusted profits were all up. In after-hours trading, Etsy shares spiked. When the markets opened the next morning, however, the stock slumped. The results, fine as they were, were not good enough.Three days later, Mr. Silverman was back in the Etsytorium, addressing his staff. The quarter was proof that changes to the company were paying off, he said, suggesting that the tumult of the past six months had not been in vain. \u201cThe quarter that we just reported, that you all worked so hard to deliver, means so much to Etsy and to all the people who rely on us,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cI\u2019m super fired up.\u201dEtsy will likely grow with Mr. Silverman as chief executive, but it may never again be the sensitive community fostered by Mr. Kalin and nurtured by Mr. Dickerson. Once a beacon of socially responsible business practices with a starry-eyed work force that believed it could fundamentally reimagine commerce, Etsy has over the past year become a case study in how the short-term pressures of the stock market can transform even the most idealistic of companies.\u201cThere\u2019s only so much wiggle room as a public company,\u201d said Mr. Stinchcomb, the early employee. \u201cIf you really want to build a company that works for people and the planet, capitalism isn\u2019t the solution.\u201dMr. Wilson, the chairman of the board, dismisses that as sentimental hooey.\u201cTo all the people who say taking Etsy public was a mistake, I say that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201c There are some people who will say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not right for me. I like the old culture.\u2019 Well, I\u2019m sorry about that. Going public was the best thing that ever happened to this company.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Signals Top Tax Priority of G.O.P. Is to Help Corporations", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 There are tough choices at the heart of the Republican tax bills speeding through Congress, and they make clear what the party values most in economic policy right now: deep and lasting tax cuts for corporations.The bill that sailed through the House on Thursday chooses to take from high-tax Democratic states, particularly California and New York, and give to lower-tax Republican states that President Trump carried in 2016, particularly Florida and Texas. It allows for tax increases on millions of families several years from now, if a future Congress does not intervene, but not for similar increases on corporations.A consistent conservative philosophy underpins all those decisions. So does a very large bet \u2014 economically and politically \u2014 on the power of business tax cuts to deliver rapid wage growth to United States workers.There is also the appearance, to liberal critics in particular, of Republicans seeking to reward their prized constituencies first, while leaving others to bear the consequences if their most optimistic scenarios do not play out.The Senate bill differed from the House version when it was introduced last week, and broke further away on Tuesday night, with a package of amendments that included repealing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that most individuals buy health insurance. To comply with procedural rules that would allow Republicans to pass the bill on a party-line vote in the Senate, the amendment also set an expiration date \u2014 Dec. 31, 2025 \u2014 on all the individual tax cuts in the legislation.In light of those changes, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation projected on Thursday that Americans earning $30,000 or less would see their taxes increase, as a group, beginning in 2021, if the Senate bill becomes law, apparently as a function of the mandate repeal driving fewer Americans to claim tax subsidies for insurance.The committee also projected that Americans earning $75,000 or below would face large tax increases in 2027, after the individual tax cuts expire. When only looking at individuals\u2019 tax bills \u2014 and not the effects of corporate taxes on individuals\u2019 incomes \u2014 the committee said Americans at all income levels would see tax increases in 2027, compared to what they would have been if the Senate bill had not passed.The House bill would raise personal taxes on Californians and New Yorkers by a combined $16 billion in 2027, Mr. Davis found, while cutting personal taxes on Texans and Floridians by more than $30 billion in total.His analysis finds so-called red states, which Mr. Trump carried in 2016, would receive more than twice as much in personal tax benefits under the plan than the blue states won by his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, when adjusting for the size of each state\u2019s economy. Only one red state \u2014 Utah \u2014 would receive lower personal tax benefits under the bill than would be expected, given how much it contributes to the national income; the average blue state, by contrast, would receive lower benefits than expected.\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for a tax bill to have varying impacts in different parts of the country,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cBut the degree to which this bill makes winners and losers out of different states is remarkable.\u201dCurtailing state and local deductions helps finance a core feature of both the House and Senate bills, which happens to be one of the few provisions Mr. Trump has called nonnegotiable in tax discussions: cutting the corporate income tax to a flat 20 percent rate, down from a top rate of 35 percent today. Republicans have kept those cuts permanent, even as the Senate applied an expiration date to the individual cuts and to a key tax credit for families preserved in the House bill. The Senate bill also sets an expiration date on breaks for so-called pass-through businesses, whose owners pay taxes on profits through the tax code for individuals.In Washington, Republicans have stressed that cutting corporate taxes will supercharge economic growth, accelerating job creation and raising wages in the process. By that theory, making such cuts permanent is essential.The gamble is apparent. Polls show that voters want corporations to pay higher, not lower, taxes and that they doubt corporate rate cuts will show up in their own paychecks, as the White House has claimed. Perhaps not coincidentally, Republican leaders have pitched their bills largely as middle-class tax cuts, stressing the benefits for the typical American family during television appearances and news conferences.\u201cThe policy expects that the corporate tax cuts will do the most for growth,\u201d said Lanhee J. Chen, a research fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, who was the policy director for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign in 2012. \u201cOn the other hand, they\u2019re the hardest to explain.\u201dRepublicans are \u201cmaking a choice as to which elements of their plan are permanent,\u201d said Jacob Leibenluft, a senior adviser at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic aide under President Barack Obama, \u201cand I think it\u2019s worth starting with taking them at face value.\u201dCanceling those looming increases would further add to the federal budget deficit, if the move is not paired with spending cuts. Middle-class families planning ahead can imagine two possible consequences from that decision: Either an immediate increase in their taxes eight years from now, or an explosion in federal budget deficits, which could necessitate spending cuts to safety net programs like Social Security and Medicare.\u201cThe bill reflects talking out of both sides of your mouth at the same time \u2014 neither of which is leading to good policy,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.Republican leaders in both chambers have said that they will not allow individual tax breaks to expire \u2014 and that their corporate cuts will yield enough growth and additional tax revenue to pay for themselves, or at least come close. Ms. MacGuineas and others fear the opposite could be even more likely: that growth will fall far short of those optimistic projections, and when the expiring tax provisions come up for reauthorization, budget deficits will be swelling. The result, they say, would be more hard choices \u2014 and predictable ones.An earlier version of this article misstated the expiration date of individual tax cuts proposed in the Senate tax overhaul plan. The cuts would expire on Dec. 31, 2025, not Dec 25, 2025.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Wanted a Bigger Tax Cut for the Rich, Ivanka Went Elsewhere", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump urged senators this month to repeal the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that most Americans have health insurance and use the proceeds to slash the top tax rate paid by the richest Americans, a suggestion that pitted his priorities against his daughter and Republican senators intent on helping the middle class.In the end, the president accepted only a partial victory. He got the repeal of the health law\u2019s individual mandate, but gave up on an income tax rate cut that would have directly benefited him personally. Instead, Ivanka Trump and her allies in the Senate prevailed in their push to include an expanded child tax credit.\u201cThis was certainly an uphill battle, especially given that it is not an issue that is as widely understood,\u201d said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah and a leading advocate of the expanded child tax credit. \u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily have the sense that the president was opposed to it. I still don\u2019t have that sense. I think if he had been, things would have worked out differently than they did.\u201dTwo White House officials pushed back against the notion that Ms. Trump had split with her father. They said middle-income tax relief was one of the president\u2019s priorities and that Ms. Trump worked in lock step with the administration on all aspects of tax reform.But the fight is actually continuing. Later this week, Mr. Lee and Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, will take on another top priority of the president\u2019s, cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. The senators plan to offer an amendment that would cut the corporate tax rate to 22 percent, instead of 20 percent, and use the proceeds to help families with little or no income tax liabilities benefit from the expanded child credit and to allow the child credit to rise with inflation.A White House spokesman, Raj Shah, wasted no time declaring the president\u2019s opposition on Wednesday.Mr. Trump was not secretive about his desire for a lower income tax rate for the nation\u2019s wealthiest families. This month, he tweeted his desire:But his suggestion that the top rate come down clashed directly with the push to assist the middle class. The president had also pressed to eliminate the estate tax, a provision that would have hugely benefited his heirs.Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee did vote unanimously to add the repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate to their bill, effectively giving themselves more than $300 billion to spend on additional tax cuts. Then lawmakers went to work to devote that money to priorities other than lowering the top income tax rate or cutting the estate tax.Senators Lee and Rubio enlisted Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who talks frequently with Ms. Trump, and Senator Dean Heller of Nevada to push the child credit expansion in the Finance Committee.\u201cIt seemed to me to be common sense if our goal was to deliver as much of a tax break for the middle class on down,\u201d Mr. Scott said.The victory somewhat improved the optics of a bill that most opinion polls suggest is unpopular among a majority of the American public. By expanding the credit to $2,000 per child from $1,650, as initially proposed in the Senate bill, Republicans substantially reduced the number of middle-class families who are likely to face an immediate tax increase under the bill.The higher child tax credit in the Senate tax plan avoids tax increases for 3.5 million families, compared to the less generous credit increase in the House plan. (Because that credit and all other individual tax breaks in the bill are scheduled to expire in 2025 to satisfy Senate procedural rules, all middle-class families face a looming tax hike in 2026 if a future Congress does not intervene.)Senate Republicans worried about those distributional effects, Mr. Scott said. By expanding the credit and also allowing taxpayers of higher incomes to claim it, he added, \u201cThat combination solved the problem for a lot of people.\u201dDemocrats have criticized the decision to include mandate repeal in the tax bill. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it will lead to 13 million fewer Americans choosing to buy health insurance or sign up for government-provided insurance such as Medicaid, and its analysis finds the move will, on balance, reduce incomes for workers earning $30,000 and below, because they will receive fewer government benefits and subsidies for care.Republicans say mandate repeal, which is politically popular, gives consumers the freedom to choose whether they buy coverage without fear of government penalty. They say the budget office is wrong to score benefits that consumers willingly forgo as lost income.But they are happy to accept the analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation that the move will free up more than $300 billion \u2014 through reduced government spending \u2014 that can be used to offset tax reductions in the bill.That money gave an opening to Mr. Lee, Mr. Rubio and Ms. Trump, who had worked together for months laying the groundwork for the child credit expansion. The group was disappointed in the House version of the tax bill and the initial Senate bill, which expanded the credit from $1,000 today, but counteracted that expansion with other lost tax breaks for families.\u201cThe nominal expansion in the original bill was quite arguably completely eaten up by other changes,\u201d Mr. Lee said.Neither Mr. Scott nor Mr. Lee would characterize their conversations with the president during that negotiating period, but Mr. Lee said there were several competing ideas for how to allocate the $300 billion.Had Mr. Trump\u2019s request for a 35 percent top rate been granted in full, Republicans would have delivered even larger benefits to high earners, whom the joint committee judges already to be the largest recipients of tax cuts under the plan. Mr. Trump would have likely seen his tax bill shrink considerably.White House officials say the president was pleased simply to see the mandate repeal included. And while Mr. Lee is still pushing for a further expansion of the child credit \u2014 one that would allow more low-income families with little or no income tax liabilities to benefit from it \u2014 he called the overall bill \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201dHe, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Scott and Mr. Heller are all expected to vote for it on the Senate floor.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "She Took On Colombia\u2019s Soda Industry. Then She Was Silenced.", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 It began with menacing phone calls, strange malfunctions of the office computers, and men in parked cars photographing the entrance to the small consumer advocacy group\u2019s offices.Then at dusk one day last December, Dr. Esperanza Cer\u00f3n, the head of the organization, said she noticed two strange men on motorcycles trailing her Chevy sedan as she headed home from work. She tried to lose them in Bogot\u00e1\u2019s rush-hour traffic, but they edged up to her car and pounded on the windows.\u201cIf you don\u2019t keep your mouth shut,\u201d one man shouted, she recalled in a recent interview, \u201cyou know what the consequences will be.\u201dThe battle over taxing sugar-sweetened beverages is becoming one of the world\u2019s most ferocious policy brawls \u2014 a clash of science, politics and money in dozens of countries and cities.The International Council of Beverages Associations, the parent organization of trade groups around the world fighting the taxes, would not directly answer the question about whether its allies in Colombia were connected to the alleged harassment, but it condemned such actions.\u201cWe reject under any circumstance the improper influence or harassment of any individual or organization for any purpose, at any time, in any way,\u201d Katherine W. Loatman, executive director of the organization, said in a statement.The battles have been particularly intense in emerging markets as the industry seeks to make up for falling soda consumption in wealthier nations. Latin America has surpassed the United States as the world\u2019s biggest soft-drink market, according to the World Health Organization, with sales of carbonated soft drinks doubling there since 2000 while they declined in the United States.\u201cSlapping a tax on our products and walking away won\u2019t do anything about obesity in this country or globally,\u201d said William Dermody, spokesman for the American Beverage Association, an industry trade group.Mexico also showcased how dirty the fight could get.The Australian Beverages Council wrote in its 2016 annual report that fighting a soft drinks tax \u201chas been consuming vast amounts of resources,\u201d and that \u201cour learnings from other markets through our international network tells us that these types of threats must be constantly challenged before they get before a parliament for debate.\u201dIn Colombia, where soda is often cheaper than bottled water, the soda-tax fight took place in a key market for beverage makers. Sales volume of carbonated drinks here has climbed more than 25 percent over the past 15 years; during that same time in the United States, it fell 12 percent, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm.Coke and Pepsi were far less visible in the Colombia battle, leaving the big national beverage company, Postob\u00f3n, in the spotlight. Postob\u00f3n, a drinks maker and distributor for Pepsi, is part of a huge conglomerate that includes sugar cane growers, sugar mills and the country\u2019s biggest media company, RCN Televisi\u00f3n, which helped disseminate the anti-tax message. Postob\u00f3n and RCN declined interview requests.The stage was set for a clash between a powerful industry and a stubborn public advocate.In early 2016, Colombia, a nation of 49 million, was facing the unfamiliar prospect of stability and peace. After decades of civil war and narco-terrorism, Colombians were enjoying the fruits of an aggressive United States-backed military campaign that had largely decimated the country\u2019s drug cartels. Unemployment was near historical lows, the poverty rate was dropping and millions were hopeful about the possibility of lasting peace with the country\u2019s main rebel group, the FARC.In March 2016, the country\u2019s health minister, Alejandro Gaviria Uribe, proposed a 20 percent tax on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages \u2014 the equivalent of about 10 cents on a liter bottle \u2014 that became part of a larger tax overhaul backed by Colombia\u2019s president and the Ministry of Finance.\u201cFor the first time in our lives, we thought we might become a normal country and be able to deal with issues other than violence,\u201d said Diana Guarnizo, a lawyer with Dejusticia, a rights group that helped promote the soda tax. \u201cHere we were, an organization that had dealt with peace, violence, land reform and gross injustice, and suddenly we had the luxury to talk about what mothers are putting in their children\u2019s lunchboxes.\u201dThe measure was designed to inject $340 million a year into Colombia\u2019s chronically underfunded national health care system, but Mr. Gaviria had a larger goal: to dampen soda consumption in a country with an obesity rate that had tripled since 1980 to 19 percent of adults. The fastest growth had occurred among Colombian youth from ages 5 to 17. Each year, 4,000 people age 30 to 70 die from obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes, the Health Ministry said.The issue attracted the attention of Dr. Cer\u00f3n, whose 10-employee organization had previously worked on climate change, smoking restrictions and the lack of potable water in poor communities. Encouraged by the health minister\u2019s soda tax announcement, they formed a coalition of three dozen civic organizations they called the Alliance for Food Health.They received crucial support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, a foundation created by Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, which dispatched experts from the United States. It also provided pivotal funding, including $260,000 for the public service ad \u2014 an amount nearly equal to Educar\u2019s entire annual budget \u2014 and paid for enhanced security at the group\u2019s offices.Postob\u00f3n, the soft drink company, promptly filed a complaint with the government\u2019s consumer protection agency, the Superintendent of Industry and Commerce, claiming that the ad\u2019s use of the teaspoon as a unit of measurement was imprecise and that it unfairly suggested that all sweetened drinks were unhealthy.Dr. Luis Fernando G\u00f3mez, a professor of preventive medicine at Javeriana University in Bogot\u00e1 who backed the tax measure, said Postob\u00f3n\u2019s allegations about the commercial were disingenuous. \u201cEvery fact and figure cited in that ad was backed up by mainstream science,\u201d he said.But the head of the Colombian consumer protection agency, a presidential appointee, sided with the industry petitioners. Just two weeks later, in a decision that Colombian legal experts described as unusually swift, the agency ordered the commercial withdrawn.Borrowing almost identical language from Postob\u00f3n\u2019s complaint \u2014 which had been filed by a company lawyer who had previously led the agency \u2014 the superintendent\u2019s office said consumers had the right to truthful information, not messages that were \u201cmisleading, imprecise and confusing.\u201dThe ruling went on to bar Educar Consumidores employees from speaking publicly about the links between sugar and obesity, an edict so sweeping it included the Health Ministry\u2019s own research on the subject.The consumer agency did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cWe were completely shut down,\u201d Dr. Cer\u00f3n said. \u201cCensored.\u201dPostob\u00f3n is a unit of one of Colombia\u2019s largest and most respected conglomerates, Organizaci\u00f3n Ardila L\u00fclle. Founded in the early 1950s by Carlos Ardila L\u00fclle, 87, Organizaci\u00f3n Ardila L\u00fclle has helped define the country\u2019s modern identity through a raft of companies that own a soccer team, an insurance company and the dealerships that sell Dodge, Jeep and Ford vehicles.Postob\u00f3n is a storied brand that sells a rainbow of homegrown drinks. Among its best-known products are a cola called Colombiana and Manzana Postob\u00f3n, a century-old apple-flavored drink that is something of a national icon.Organizaci\u00f3n Ardila L\u00fclle remained silent during the soda-tax debate, and company executives declined to be interviewed. Instead, Postob\u00f3n, RCN and allies like the National Business Association of Colombia carried the message that the tax would cost jobs, decimate independent convenience shop owners and choke the economy.\u201cIn Colombia, the sugar industry and the main media companies belong to the same economic conglomerates,\u201d Mr. Gaviria, the health minister, said. \u201cThey have an intimidating power. And they used it.\u201dThat fall, at least 90 lobbyists worked to sway legislators, according to a tally of visitor logs obtained by Educar Consumidores. During committee hearings on the measure, lobbyists often sat next to lawmakers, a flagrant violation of congressional rules, said \u00d3scar Ospina Quintero, a legislator from the Green Alliance party. Mr. Ospina said he protested the lobbyists\u2019 presence in the chamber but was rebuffed by congressional leaders.\u201cThe response was fierce,\u201d Mr. Gaviria said. \u201cI remember that, during one of the debates, a senator said to me: \u2018In all my years in Congress I\u2019ve never seen a lobbying effort like this.\u2019\u201dIn October, not long after she was censored by the government, Dr. Cer\u00f3n found a tactic she thought might keep attention on the subject without running afoul of the government\u2019s order silencing her. In a blog item posted on the Alliance for Food Health website, she made fun of an RCN soap opera from 1980s called \u201cAz\u00facar,\u201d or Sugar, that was set in Colombia\u2019s sugar cane heartland. Scrawled across a publicity poster for the show, she wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to watch Sugar; it\u2019s another to drink it in excess.\u201dAn RCN lawyer demanded she delete the post, claiming it was intellectual property theft. She complied, but the network filed a complaint with federal prosecutors who, in turn, opened a criminal investigation. The case, still pending, carries a possible fine of $300,000.\u201cIf they win,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be financially ruined.\u201dIt was around this time that employees at Educar\u2019s offices began to complain about echoes and other voices on their cellphones. They suspected they might be under surveillance. Others found it hard to use the internet in the office. In October, Dr. Cer\u00f3n\u2019s office phone ceased functioning entirely. \u201cSometimes we could not work at all because our laptops would stop following orders and the mouse would just do what it wanted,\u201d Diana Vivas, the group\u2019s lawyer, said.Ms. Lane of Bloomberg Philanthropies was so concerned that she stopped using email and the phone to discuss strategy with Educar. Instead, she moved communications to some of the same encrypted apps used after the surveillance of soda-tax advocates was discovered in Mexico.Called in to investigate, Andr\u00e9s Erazo, Educar\u2019s longtime tech consultant, said he discovered that antivirus software on workplace computers had been disabled. He also found spyware on the office router that gave an unknown outsider access to the organization\u2019s web traffic and online communication. According to Mr. Erazo, three cellphones \u2014 including those used by Dr. Cer\u00f3n and Ms. Vivas \u2014 had been compromised by spyware.Mr. Erazo urged Dr. Cer\u00f3n to buy new cellphones but she refused. \u201cIf they\u2019re listening to us, what are they going to hear?\u201d he recalled her telling him. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a public health campaign!\u201dOne morning in mid-November, Dr. Cer\u00f3n was startled awake at 5 a.m. by a call to her cellphone.\u201cShut up, you old wench,\u201d the caller yelled, according to a report she filed with the Fiscal General de la Naci\u00f3n, Colombia\u2019s prosecutorial agency.In early December, Dr. Cer\u00f3n was walking to the gym when a man, his face obscured by a hooded sweatshirt, accosted her with the same message. \u201cC\u00e1llese,\u201d he yelled before walking away, or, \u201ckeep your mouth shut.\u201dShe reported both episodes to prosecutors.A spokesman for the prosecutorial agency declined to comment on Dr. C\u00e9ron\u2019s complaints, citing privacy rules that bar discussion of cases with anyone not directly involved.Dr. Cer\u00f3n stopped driving alone. And she pressed the local news media to cover the intimidation, but it was facing its own challenges from tax opponents.With its cordon of armed guards, bomb-sniffing dogs and airport-style X-ray machines, the headquarters of Colombia\u2019s oldest newspaper, El Espectador, is among the most heavily fortified compounds in the country. The need for such measures is driven home by a sixth-floor display: showcased behind glass is a yellowing front page reporting the assassination of El Espectador\u2019s editor, Guillermo Cano, who was gunned down on Dec. 17, 1986, as he drove home from work.Three years later, a huge truck bomb shattered the newspaper\u2019s offices, killing a reporter and wounding 83 others. During the 1980s and 1990s, violence claimed the lives of a dozen El Espectador employees \u2014 all victims of Colombian drug cartels angered by the newspaper\u2019s unflinching coverage.El Espectador news editors said they sought to cover the soda tax fight evenhandedly in the news pages, even as the paper supported the tax in its editorials.Industry executives were not happy with the paper\u2019s stance, but they got especially upset when it produced a video, part of a biweekly commentary called La Pulla, that lampooned tax opponents for ignoring scientific evidence about the risks of excess sugar.\u201cOnce we published the video, things got crazy,\u201d the paper\u2019s health and science editor, Pablo Correa, said.The video was posted just before midnight on Dec. 15, quickly drawing 500,000 views. In the morning, Fidel Cano, the publisher of El Espectador and a nephew of the paper\u2019s slain editor, said he had received a call from a senior advertising executive at the newspaper who told him a representative from Coca-Cola had called in protest and demanded that the Sprite bottle be removed.Mr. Cano winced recalling what came next. With the prospect of litigation and lost ad revenue, he says he ordered the bottle edited out. In a small act of defiance, he allowed the Sprite advertisement tagline to remain.The altered video went viral, drawing more than two million views and prompting a public discussion about censorship and the power of the soda industry.\u201cDid they win?\u201d Mr. Cano reflected. \u201cNot really.\u201dReached by phone, the newspaper\u2019s vice president for advertising, Mauricio Uma\u00f1a, disputed Mr. Cano\u2019s account, saying he had not received a call from Coca-Cola or any other soda company executive.Other media outlets felt the industry\u2019s pressure.At the Colombian branch of the online news site Vice, the editorial staff clashed with advertising executives over their efforts to squelch a column criticizing the soda industry. Vice had previously run two opinion pieces in favor of the soda tax and the disputed third column did ultimately run, though not on the home page, making it hard for readers to find.The incident was part of what prompted Vice Colombia\u2019s founding editor, Juan Camilo Maldonado, to resign. Mr. Maldonado declined to be interviewed for this article but colleagues with direct knowledge of the incident said he was dismayed the company would cave to pressure from advertisers.A spokesman for Vice did not address the reasons for Mr. Maldonado\u2019s resignation, but said, \u201cThe fact that all of the stories were published and were critical of the soda industry speaks for itself.\u201dOn the last day of 2016, opponents of the tax were victorious. Using a complex procedural maneuver, congressional leaders killed the soda tax, dropping it from the larger tax overhaul package.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t just sugar,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n Duque, a senator from the right-leaning Democratic Center party and a contender in next year\u2019s presidential race, who was a vocal critic of the tax. \u201cWe need a national plan to fight sedentary lifestyles, better product labeling and education efforts that teach people to eat more fruit, fish and vegetables.\u201d\u201cIt was a great victory for free speech in Colombia,\u201d Dr. Cer\u00f3n said. \u201cThe only pity is it came too late.\u201dThe article in La Rep\u00fablica, however, did not mention one key ingredient: sugar. According to the label on the drink, one juice box of it contains 13 grams of sugar, more than half the daily recommended level for children.Reporting was contributed by Wesley Tomaselli from Bogot\u00e1, Anahad O\u2019Connor from San Francisco and Ayesha Venkataraman from Mumbai, India.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can a Wild Daisy Rejuvenate Croatia\u2019s Farming Economy?", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZadar JournalZADAR, Croatia \u2014 For generations, residents of Zadar, an idyllic town on the Adriatic coast of Croatia, used the dry, stringy stems and yellow blossoms of a common variety of a wild daisy as kindling, mostly to singe the hair off pigs destined for the spit.But about five years ago, cosmetics manufacturers and the essential oils industry started using a rare extract from the flower \u2014 known as the curry plant for its spicy aroma \u2014 as a critical ingredient in high-end creams, ointments and tinctures, sold for their purported rejuvenating powers.So let the pigs shave themselves, local residents decided, turning their attention to gathering bushels of the once widely ignored weed, in hopes of creating a new local industry to add to an economy based on construction, fruit farming, olive oil and a touch of tourism.So far they haven\u2019t had too much success.\u201cI should start putting some of this stuff on my own face,\u201d said Nino Simunic, 48, ignoring the bucolic vista of yachts and ferries crossing Zadar\u2019s channel.Instead, he scanned the harsh ground from atop his tractor, putt-putting across a moonlike limestone hillside, for any signs of a curry plant, also known as \u201cimmortelle\u201d for its ability to survive in dry terrain and to remain alive long after being plucked.In 2015, Mr. Simunic, a veteran of Croatia\u2019s early-1990s war for independence, ended a tumultuous 15-year career in local politics and joined the ranks of residents seeking some sort of financial boost from the curry plant. A local monastery of Benedictine nuns became partners with him, providing the 12 acres of land he\u2019s farming in exchange for a cut of revenues, he said. If there are any.It\u2019s Mr. Simunic\u2019s first harvest, and he\u2019s not saddled with any expectations.\u201cIf it covers at least some of the fuel and lunch costs, I\u2019m happy,\u201d he said.The search for profit from the curry plant is driven by Croatia\u2019s continuing economic troubles. The global financial crisis was largely responsible for a six-year recession. And the country\u2019s 2013 move to join the European Union brought competitively priced goods from elsewhere in the bloc onto store shelves, adding to the woes of the struggling agricultural and manufacturing sectors.These days, the nation of 4.2 million relies on a tourism boom, mainly on the Adriatic coast, with the summer season responsible for nearly a fifth of its economic output.So farmers in inland regions and towns like Zadar are always on the lookout for a new avenue of cash.That\u2019s where immortelle \u2014 with the Latin name Helichrysum italicum \u2014 fits in.\u201cThe essential oils found within the flower help to improve the skin\u2019s ability to fight the effects of environmental aggressions, which are known to accelerate skin aging,\u201d said Lucy Primrose, the director of learning and organizational development for L\u2019Occitane. The company\u2019s line of immortelle-infused products has become \u201cadored by our customers,\u201d she said.But the French cosmetics giant gets its immortelle from farms in Corsica. And so far Zadar\u2019s farmers have had little luck creating a direct partnership with a cosmetics or essential oils company. Instead they sell their curry plant harvests in raw form to nearby distillers, who act as a bridge to manufacturers that have relationships with larger cosmetics firms.Selling immortelle to distillers is somewhat profitable; the plant\u2019s oil fetches up to 2,500 euros per kilogram, or about 1.15 liters.Zadar\u2019s immortelle farmers think the quantity and quality of their individual crops will become too great for the cosmetics industry to ignore. Their hope remains as resilient as the immortelle.In the first years after manufacturers took interest in the plant, many farmers tried to increase their crop output. But that involved watering and fertilization techniques that diluted the quality of the extracted oil.Distillers then lowered their offers for raw plants.\u201cThis is a classic Croatian agriculture story, from success to failure,\u201d said Mario Skelin, a local plant conservationist, who pointed to a distinct lack of unity among Zadar\u2019s many curry plant farmers when negotiating with distillers and producers. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten to the failure part yet.\u201dMr. Skelin has tried to band farmers together to gain leverage when dealing with distillers. So far individualism has held sway, with farmers wanting to build their own distilleries.\u201cThe problem is there is no industrial standard,\u201d Mr. Skelin said, showing a picture of three test tubes containing immortelle extract \u2014 each a different shade of yellow. He said that many wholesale buyers priced oils without explaining their criteria or pricing decisions. \u201cWe need to do a better job of branding ourselves,\u201d he said.Some farmers are hedging their bets, investing in other oft-neglected plants.Ivica Djurica, 62, had an accidental over-yield of his curry plants six years ago, with a surplus of 800,000 seedlings just as locals started looking to immortelle. Mr. Djurica sold his extra seedlings to ambitious local farmers, making him an unwitting cog in the curry plant\u2019s local industry.Now he and his wife, Mirna Djurica, 47, hope to expand their business, adding lavender, hyssop and other medicinal herbs to the property. The idea is a full-fledged essential oil and aromatherapy operation.Arid, dusty soil crunched under her feet as she walked through a field while cicadas crackled from the bushes jutting out of the hill.\u201cA tough life is good for curry plants,\u201d she said, heading back to a small stone bungalow at the end of the field. \u201cAnd this is the life we wanted.\u201dThe Djuricas have plans for an in-house distillery, which could then theoretically finance the creation of a full agri-tourism operation.\u201cWe can\u2019t only grow curry plants,\u201d she said, just as a gust cut across the thick field of green and yellow, kicking up the immortelle\u2019s deep, smokelike peppery smell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Companies Get High Marks for Covering Infertility Treatments", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserA relatively small number of companies offer generous benefits for infertility treatment to employees, while most have minimal or no coverage, a new report found.It\u2019s a case of \u201chaves and have-nots,\u201d said Jake Anderson, a founder of FertilityIQ, the start-up that wrote the report.It found that technology companies as well as employers in consulting and banking tended to offer generous coverage for costly assisted-reproduction techniques like in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F.FertilityIQ was founded by Mr. Anderson and Deborah Bialis, a married couple who saw a need for more detailed information after undergoing treatment for infertility themselves. FertilityIQ gathers information from more than 10,000 verified I.V.F. patients who contribute to its database. Employers examined in the report included companies where FertilityIQ\u2019s participants work, as well as additional employers identified by fertility clinics or researched by Fertility IQ itself, Mr. Anderson said.FertilityIQ\u2019s goal is to provide as much detail as possible, he said, to help people navigate their way through a stressful process. Mr. Anderson\u2019s advice to those seeking infertility treatment was simply, \u201cBuckle in, financially and emotionally.\u201dEmployer benefits are important, the couple said, because I.V.F. is costly and demand for it is increasing.Treatment isn\u2019t cheap. The cost of a single cycle of I.V.F. is often about $12,000, but that number is just a start. Drugs and related procedures, like genetic screening, push the average price in most major metropolitan areas to well above $20,000 per cycle, FertilityIQ found. And most couples undergo at least two cycles on average, Mr. Anderson said.The report ranks individual employers and broad sectors, based on criteria that include the value of the benefits and the ease with which employees can use them. Some companies rank higher because they avoid preauthorization rules, like trying unsuccessfully to conceive for a period of time or receiving a specific infertility diagnosis, that can be particularly restrictive for same-sex couples or single women, Mr. Anderson said.The technology industry, in particular, shines at making infertility benefits widely accessible, the report found, and some employers are in a sort of benefits arms race, offering more generous coverage to remain competitive in recruiting and retaining workers. Facebook ranks high on the list of tech companies, as it did in FertilityIQ\u2019s report last year. The company covers up to four I.V.F. cycles, including genetic testing, with no preapproval required. (FertilityIQ values the cycles at $25,000 each, for a total benefit value of $100,000.)Other tech companies are beefing up coverage, according to the new analysis.Microsoft is expanding its benefit in January, replacing a fixed amount of $15,000 with a more flexible offering. \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re providing industry-leading benefits,\u201d said Sonja Kellen, director of global health and wellness benefits at Microsoft.Microsoft will work with Progyny, a fertility benefits manager, to offer up to three treatment cycles. The benefit includes genetic testing as well as the freezing of eggs or embryos and storage for up to four years. The new policy makes treatment available to employees without demonstrated infertility issues, so gay couples pursuing parenthood through surrogacy or a single woman who wants to freeze eggs for use in the future can use the benefit.The new approach aims to make benefits more broadly available and helps reduce pressure on employees undergoing I.V.F. to maximize their benefit, Ms. Kellen said.For instance, a couple undergoing I.V.F. with a dollar cap on their employer benefit may decide to have multiple embryos transferred at one time, perhaps resulting in twins or triplets. Those pregnancies are more likely to have complications.Medications for the treatment are covered separately, through the company\u2019s prescription drug benefit, she said.Pinterest, the online social network, covered up to $20,000 for treatment costs this year, but will change its benefit in January to cover up to four rounds of I.V.F., said a company spokeswoman, Malorie Lucich. The expansion, she said, was based on feedback the company received from its 1,200 employees.\u201cIt\u2019s a very family friendly culture here,\u201d she said.Among other big tech companies, Google covers three cycles including genetic testing, a benefit that FertilityIQ values at $75,000, and Apple offers a $20,000 benefit. Neither company requires preapproval. Amazon\u2019s benefit of $15,000 with a required preauthorization placed it relatively low on FertilityIQ\u2019s list of tech companies.Some companies in consulting, like Bain, and finance, like Bank of America, offer unlimited I.V.F. benefits as long as employees meet preauthorization rules, the report found.Other financial companies offer more limited coverage, yet are moving to expand it. American Express, for instance, increased its cap for treatment this year to $35,000, up from $20,000, for full-time and part-time employees.Retail companies generally rank low on FertilityIQ\u2019s list, Mr. Anderson said, but Starbucks is notable for making a $15,000 I.V.F. benefit available, including to part-time store workers.Here are some questions and answers about infertility coverage:What should I do if my employer doesn\u2019t offer I.V.F. benefits?Employees can lobby their human resources departments to offer coverage, particularly if their employers are \u201cself insured\u201d \u2014 meaning the companies pay claims themselves, rather than paying a premium to an insurer, said Barbara Collura, president and chief executive of Resolve, an infertility support and advocacy group.Self-insured employers \u2014 typically companies with more than 250 workers \u2014 have more leeway to expand coverage, Ms. Collura said. Employers that don\u2019t self-insure have less flexibility because the benefits are determined by the insurer, she said.Eights states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island) require employers to offer some level of I.V.F. benefit, Ms. Collura said. But coverage isn\u2019t necessarily generous, and self-insured employers and small employers are typically exempt from the laws.Is financial help available for the cost of infertility treatment?What proportion of employers over all offer I.V.F. benefits?About a quarter of employers with 500 or more workers cover the procedure, while 37 percent of employers with 20,000 or more workers cover it, according to a 2017 report from the benefits consultant Mercer \u2014 about the same level found the previous year.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Broadcom Targets Qualcomm in Largest-Ever Tech Deal", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Hock Tan studiously avoided the limelight, even as he built a onetime division of Hewlett-Packard into what is now Broadcom, a semiconductor maker whose chips help power the newest iPhone.On Monday, another reason for the move became apparent. Mr. Tan announced that his company had offered to buy another major chip maker, Qualcomm, for $105 billion, in what would be the biggest takeover in the history of the technology industry. The combined company\u2019s products would touch nearly every smartphone in the world.It is a deal that may be more likely to receive regulatory approval with Broadcom based in the United States \u2014 and with the president on Mr. Tan\u2019s side.But Broadcom\u2019s takeover bid comes as big technology companies are facing ever more political scrutiny. Politicians have been voicing concerns about the influence of technology companies, while President Trump has taken a dim view of foreign acquisitions.Mr. Tan has long been known as a savvy deal maker who led consolidation in the chip industry. If he pulls this deal off, his political maneuvering could be used as a sort of template for other executives.Complications are already adding up. Qualcomm is expected to reject the bid as opportunistic and too cheap. And analysts and investors have raised the prospect that a merger of the two companies might be blocked by government regulators, either on antitrust grounds or because Broadcom could still be considered a foreign company buying sensitive technology.But Mr. Tan and his team have already made moves to address some of those issues. Publicly, Broadcom said the plan to move its legal headquarters to the United States was tied to Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code, including the cutting of corporate tax rates. But getting on the good side of the Trump administration \u2014 which will have a say in takeovers like the Qualcomm bid \u2014 was another factor, according to a person briefed on the matter.In an interview, Mr. Tan, 65, played down any connection between his headquarters announcement at the White House and the Qualcomm bid, asserting that the timing had been coincidental.\u201cWe think very long term,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we perceive is that the business environment has steadily improved. As we want to grow our business in the long term, that makes it easier to choose to redomicile in the U.S. to sustain our growth trends.\u201dThat Mr. Tan is in the driver\u2019s seat for consolidation in the chip industry reflects his unlikely rise in the technology world. At the White House last Thursday, he recounted being \u201can 18-year-old skinny kid\u201d from Malaysia who had been able to attend M.I.T. only because he won a scholarship.He eventually jumped into the chip business, showing off a mastery of operations and an eye for high finance and deal making. Mr. Tan ended up at Broadcom\u2019s predecessor, Avago Technologies, in 2006, soon after the investment firms Silver Lake and KKR bought the company. Avago\u2019s corporate history can be traced back to Hewlett-Packard.Much of Mr. Tan\u2019s tenure since then has been spent thinking about the long-term future of the semiconductor business. He has long been a proponent of consolidation, buying established chip franchises with healthy profit margins and selling off the parts that are not financially successful.Mr. Tan\u2019s deal-making streak began in earnest in 2013, when Avago bought LSI, a maker of networking chips, for $6.6 billion. Two years later, Avago bought Emulex for $606 million, and then the much-bigger Broadcom for $37 billion. The deal for Qualcomm would be $130 billion including debt.Mr. Tan has for years pushed growth by acquisition. Underpinning the strategy is a recognition that the semiconductor business has largely matured. The rate of revolutionary change has slowed, and chip companies have focused more on price competition, leading to lower profit margins. His approach has been to gain scale by buying market leaders and then running those companies more efficiently \u2014 while also investing in technologies that customers like Apple want.\u201cHock\u2019s competitive advantage comes from understanding customer needs and market shifts in the chip space better than anyone in the world,\u201d Kenneth Hao, a managing partner at Silver Lake who helped bring Mr. Tan to Avago, said in a statement.But consolidation has led to concerns that the chip industry could become concentrated in the hands of just a few big players. Qualcomm itself is in the midst of acquiring NXP Semiconductor for $38.5 billion, while Broadcom is still awaiting national security approval for its $5.5 billion takeover of Brocade Communications.Some analysts have wondered whether Broadcom, with Singapore as its legal headquarters, could face issues with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government group that examines takeovers for threats to national security. But while a deal could face such a review, neither company believes that it would be the main obstacle to a transaction getting done, according to several people briefed on the bid. Broadcom\u2019s operations are largely in the United States, and its legal base is in Singapore primarily because of that country\u2019s low tax rate.The biggest issue may simply be that Qualcomm believes the current offer, worth about $70 a share, is too low. Qualcomm\u2019s trove of patents \u2014 among the most formidable in the world of wireless networking \u2014 remains a hugely valuable asset. And the company could also believe that closing the NXP acquisition and reaching either a victory over or a settlement with Apple would lift its stock price.But Qualcomm, the longtime leader in cellphone chip technology, has been grappling with a sagging stock price and investor wariness that the Apple fight will continue for some time.On Monday, Qualcomm said that its board was weighing Broadcom\u2019s offer.Mr. Tan said in the interview that he believed that, should Broadcom succeed in buying Qualcomm, he could make peace with Apple.But to win over Qualcomm, Broadcom may need to do something it hasn\u2019t done before: wage a hostile takeover, including by replacing at least part of its quarry\u2019s board. Although Mr. Tan professed a desire to reach a consensual deal, he suggested that he was prepared to take whatever steps necessary to win.\u201cWe really know what our options are, and we haven\u2019t really eliminated them,\u201d he said.Ana Swanson, Cecilia Kang and Don Clark contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Revealing Spin on the \u2018Sharing Economy\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyFor decades after its Communist revolution in 1949, China was known as \u201cthe kingdom of bicycles.\u201d The one-speed Flying Pigeons that swarmed the streets were not simply a cheap mode of transportation. They were symbols of a shared aspiration. Along with a radio, a watch and a sewing machine, a bicycle was one of four possessions \u2014 known as sanzhuan yixiang, or \u201cthree rounds and sound\u201d \u2014 that urban Chinese families felt they needed to be part of the modern world. By the time I joined the masses in 2001, cycling across Beijing for daily Mandarin classes, cars had begun to displace bicycles. Pedaling alongside my fellow commuters \u2014 students, workers, pensioners \u2014 I felt part of a communal experience that might soon be gone forever.I was wrong, of course. China\u2019s cities are suddenly teeming with bicycles, and the humble one-speed, that remnant of China\u2019s collective memory, again serves as more than just a means of conveyance. It is now a digital device too, helping shape one of China\u2019s most dynamic growth engines \u2014 the so-called sharing economy. Three years ago, bike-sharing didn\u2019t exist in China. Today more than 40 companies offer the service. And the top two alone, Mobike and Ofo, handle more than 50 million rides every day, solving the \u201clast mile\u201d problem of getting people from public transportation to their homes.China\u2019s bike-sharing explosion is driven by digital innovations that make renting \u201cdockless\u201d bikes easy, cheap and completely cool. All it takes is a smartphone: to find the nearest bike via GPS, to scan its QR code and open its smartlocks and to pay a minuscule fee (usually 15 cents or less per ride) through a mobile-payment app. At the end, the bikes can be left almost anywhere. (In the United States, bicycles often need to be picked up and returned to a fixed dock, as with New York\u2019s Citi Bike.) For a generation of consumers conditioned to adapt to new things, the draw is no longer the pride of ownership but has become convenience and cachet. For the companies and, more pointedly, the Chinese government, the potential windfall comes not so much from profits, which remain elusive, but from the consumer data produced by every transaction.The state-run press agency, Xinhua, has trumpeted bike-sharing as one of China\u2019s \u201cfour great new inventions.\u201d (The other three are mobile payments, e-commerce and high-speed rail.) It may sound absurd to compare a dockless bike to the world-changing inventions of China\u2019s past: paper, gunpowder, the compass and movable type. But the boast conveys the importance that Beijing assigns the \u201csharing economy\u201d in helping China make the leap from a manufacturing-based to a service-oriented economy. Last year, according to government figures, China\u2019s sharing economy accounted for more than $500 billion in transactions involving roughly 600 million people. (An estimated 55 million Americans will use a sharing service this year, according to a CBS report.) And with Beijing planning on an annual 40 percent growth rate, officials are commanding this new economic engine to account for 10 percent of the national gross domestic product by 2020 and 20 percent by 2025.In this frenzy, investors have thrown millions of dollars at almost any venture with a \u201csharing\u201d label, from basketballs and refrigerators to luxury handbags and phone chargers. Not all the ideas fare well. The Shared Girlfriend sex-doll service, for example, was shut down in September in response to a public outcry. The police also forced a Beijing company to stop renting out \u201cnapping capsules,\u201d condemning them as fire hazards. Other ideas, on closer inspection, hardly look innovative. The \u201cshared bookstore\u201d is really just a lending library. And the \u201cshared washing-machine service\u201d \u2014 isn\u2019t that a laundromat?China\u2019s sharing economy has veered sharply away from how the term was originally defined: as a peer-to-peer exchange of underutilized goods and services. In China, \u201csharing\u201d now means almost any short-term rental of a product or service activated by a smartphone. Moreover, the things on offer, like Ofo\u2019s 6.5 million bikes, are not spread out among individuals but are owned by the tech companies themselves. The same is true for the spoils, from revenue to data. As a result, the ideals that still animate the concept in many other places \u2014 the reallocation of unused resources and the community that forms around it \u2014 are essentially absent in China. \u201cI was thrilled when I first heard China was so committed to the sharing economy,\u201d says April Rinne, an adviser who is a member of China\u2019s National Sharing Economy Commission. \u201cBut it\u2019s all so transactional, and the definition of sharing has gotten so broad that it\u2019s almost meaningless. As China defines it, even Amazon would be part of the sharing economy.\u201dWho can blame China for hanging on to the term \u201csharing economy\u201d? It fits with the image that Beijing wants to project: warm, generous, egalitarian. Robin Li, the chief executive of the internet giant Baidu, said last year that \u201cthe idea of a sharing economy is quite similar to that of a communist society,\u201d because both focus on \u201cdistribution according to need.\u201d A strategic planner at the advertising firm Havas Worldwide waxed so rhapsodic in a commentary about \u201cthe close-knit comradeship\u201d of Chinese consumers that it seemed the idea of sharing was itself a Chinese invention. \u201cThere is almost a sense of nobility garnered by having the means to own something yet deciding to share instead,\u201d the author wrote. The prize for puffery, however, goes to The People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, which in August celebrated umbrella-sharing enterprises as \u201ca show of human care, releasing the warmth of the city.\u201d A few weeks after that, nearly all 300,000 umbrellas distributed by a new company called Sharing E Umbrella had been either lost or stolen.None of China\u2019s bike-sharing companies are turning a profit yet. But even as they fight for market share, the data is the destination. \u201cCollecting data is the first goal of the sharing economy,\u201d says William Chou, the head of Deloitte\u2019s telecoms, media and technology practice in China. Every time consumers scan the QR code on a bicycle \u2014 or basketball, handbag, umbrella \u2014 they provide information about habits, locations, behaviors and payment histories. That\u2019s invaluable not just to Tencent and Alibaba but also to city planners seeking precise information about where to build roads, bridges and subways. \u201cThe fight is no longer over who has the biggest fleet,\u201d Towson says, \u201cbut who has the smartest fleet.\u201dThose are the benign side-effects of the sharing economy. But what happens as this data filters into China\u2019s new social-credit system, which promises to rate every individual by her financial, social and political worth? In fact, Beijing has authorized Tencent and Alibaba to conduct social-credit pilot testing, and their bikes serve as the perfect vehicles. There are no walls of privacy. The government has the ability to access company data, good or bad, faster than you can scan a QR code.One morning recently in Shanghai, I caught a glimpse of some suspicious behavior. I was walking down a tranquil, tree-lined street when a muscular man lumbered past carrying two orange-and-silver Mobikes. As he swept by, a wheel touched the ground and set off an alarm, causing him to heave the bikes even higher in the air. The man was not a bike enthusiast, but he wasn\u2019t a thief, either. As I watched him slip down a side alley and emerge moments later empty-handed, I realized that he was a foot soldier in the bike-sharing wars, dumping competitors\u2019 bikes in hard-to-find places. Rounding the corner, I saw the result of his handiwork: a sea of bikes in almost every hue. Yet not a single orange-and-silver Mobike was in sight.An earlier version of this article transliterated incorrectly a Chinese term that means \u201cthree rounds and sound.\u201d That term is sanzhuan yixiang, not sanshengyixiang.Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If No One Owns the Moon, Can Anyone Make Money Up There?", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "Ambiguities in the 50-year-old Outer Space Treaty may be getting in the way of entrepreneurs seeking opportunities elsewhere in our solar system.Supported byMoon Express would not need all of these facilities if its only goal were to win the Lunar X Prize.Its second spacecraft aims to land in 2019 near the moon\u2019s south pole. A third, larger spacecraft in 2020 is to gather samples and then bring them back to Earth, the first haul of moon rocks since a Soviet robotic probe\u2019s return in 1976.But these plans almost came to a halt a couple of years ago \u2014 not because of technological challenges or financial shortfalls, but because of an international agreement known as the Outer Space Treaty, which is marking its 50th anniversary this year.The treaty spells out what countries are and are not allowed to do in space. Its crowning achievement was stopping the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union from expanding into space.But the agreement may now be getting in the way of entrepreneurs with plans to push farther and faster into space than national agencies like NASA.\u201cBefore it was something really, really hypothetical,\u201d said Fabio Tronchetti, a law professor at Harbin Institute of Technology in China. \u201cBut now there are groups that are really serious. It changes everything.\u201dRobert D. Richards, Moon Express\u2019s chief executive \u2014 whose business plan is \u201cto expand Earth\u2019s economic sphere to the moon and beyond\u201d \u2014 is far from the only entrepreneur looking for business opportunities beyond our planet.As these companies go where no businesses have gone before, they raise questions only fuzzily addressed by the Outer Space Treaty: What are private companies allowed to do in space? Can a company mine the moon or an asteroid and then sell what it has pulled out? How are countries to regulate these businesses?Internationally, countries have been discussing how to answer these questions. In the United States, Congress has begun tackling regulatory issues. Some warn that if the United States does not set up business-friendly policies, then the start-ups could move elsewhere \u2014 including such seemingly unlikely places as Luxembourg.The treaty also prohibited nations from making any claim of sovereignty over any part of the rest of the solar system.Moon Express ran into a bureaucratic wall because the treaty declares that activities of nongovernmental entities \u2014 a classification that includes commercial companies \u2014 \u201crequire authorization and continuing supervision\u201d of the government. (The United States had insisted on the clause, rejecting the Soviet view that space exploration should be limited to governments.)The Federal Aviation Administration licenses rocket launches and re-entry of commercial spacecraft from orbit in order to ensure the safety of people on the ground. The Federal Communications Commission regulates communications satellites, and the Department of Commerce regulates commercial remote sensing satellites.But the United States does not as yet have a process for authorizing or supervising novel endeavors like a private company landing on the moon.In announcing the decision, however, the F.A.A. said the approval applied only to this one Moon Express launch, and that not even Moon Express could count on a favorable outcome in the future.Moon Express has begun discussions with the F.A.A. for the second trip to the lunar south pole, and Dr. Richards is confident that the company could successfully pull off its first three flights via the current regulatory patchwork.But if Congress and the president do not come up with a better solution, Moon Express, SpaceX, Blue Origin and the rest of the emerging industry could run into more bureaucratic walls, and companies might start looking for other places to set up shop.Dr. Richards said he remained optimistic.\u201cEach company is moving forward with some assumption of risk but a presumption of the U.S. government coming through with frameworks that allow that to happen,\u201d Dr. Richards said in October during a visit at his company\u2019s Florida headquarters.Planetary Resources\u2019s goal is to mine the solar system\u2019s asteroids. Luxembourg, a nation smaller than Rhode Island with a long history in mining, has bet 200 million euros \u2014 more than $225 million \u2014 on this industry that does not exist. That includes $28 million invested in Planetary Resources. In return, Luxembourg owns a 10 percent share of the company, said Etienne Schneider, the country\u2019s deputy prime minister.Back in April, Luxembourg\u2019s crown prince, his wife and government officials paid a visit to Planetary Resources, putting on white gowns, gloves, wispy caps and baby blue bootees \u2014 a distinctly unroyal outfit sometimes called a \u201cbunny suit\u201d \u2014 to take a close look at where the company is assembling small satellites.In June, Mr. Schneider returned to the United States to host a symposium with a roomful of bankers and venture capitalists, a vivid demonstration that private space investment has reached a tipping point of credibility.A Goldman Sachs report about innovative space businesses that came out in the spring seemed to agree. \u201cSpace mining could be more realistic than perceived,\u201d the report said. \u201cWhile the psychological barrier to mining asteroids is high, the actual financial and technological barriers are far lower.\u201dAt the Manhattan presentation, Mr. Schneider readily acknowledged that the notion of asteroid mining sounds like science fiction and that he often gets quizzical questions about why Luxembourg is spending money chasing this.Mr. Schneider recalled that during a visit to Silicon Valley in 2012, he met S. Pete Worden, then the director of the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., who suggested that Luxembourg look into asteroid mining.\u201cAt the time, I listened to him and wondered what this guy might have smoked,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.But more discussions and research convinced Mr. Schneider this was a promising possibility.For Planetary Resources, the first wave of development is to culminate in a doughnut-shape spacecraft heading on a prospecting mission to a near-Earth asteroid in 2020.Sometime after that, the company hopes to mine in earnest \u2014 for seemingly mundane water ice. But water, in addition to potentially providing something to drink for astronauts, can be split into hydrogen and oxygen. Both can be used as rocket propellent; the oxygen, of course, also can provide air to breathe.As a business, Planetary Resources is betting that by the time it extracts water from an asteroid, there will be a customer like NASA interested in buying water, hydrogen and oxygen.Eventually, the company aims to extract platinum, currently worth more than $900 an ounce, and other precious metals.To make these pursuits easier, Luxembourg passed a space law that took effect this summer. Planetary Resources has set up its European office there. Moves like this one are in part motivating policymakers in the United States to devote more attention to American laws that currently govern commercial space activities.Ambiguities in the Outer Space Treaty currently create uncertainty over whether anyone can profit from such business ventures. Article II in particular states, \u201cOuter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.\u201dThis year, Congress is revisiting the Outer Space Treaty again, hoping to boost nascent space companies looking to push outward into the solar system.It would put the regulatory power in an Office of Space Commerce, which would have 60 days to decide whether to approve or deny a company\u2019s application. The full House has not yet taken up the bill, and the Senate is still working on its version.Officials at Moon Express and Planetary Resources say they do not want unfettered freedom in space, nor do they seek withdrawal from the Outer Space Treaty.\u201cOur goal is to have a space environment that is populated by people acting responsibly,\u201d said Peter Marquez, vice president for global engagement at Planetary Resources. \u201cIf there aren\u2019t any adults in the room, it concerns me. If it turns into the wild, wild West of just do whatever you want, then that kind of runs against concepts and precepts of Outer Space Treaty.\u201dThese companies do want the regulations to be \u201clight-touch\u201d and hope that the default inclination of the U.S. government will be to say yes.Once the price of transportation comes down, more business opportunities will open up, Dr. Richards said.The moon, peppered with the impacts of asteroids over the eons, should also possess dollops of platinum and other precious metals. Helium-3, embedded in the lunar crust by the solar wind, could be fuel for future fusion power plants.Moon Express\u2019s family of spacecraft could be a boon to scientists, sending low-cost probes not just to the moon but to other planets.Patches of eternal sunshine on the moon could be limited, valuable resources that nations and companies will someday squabble over.Dr. Richards compared this moment he sees coming to the 19th century California Gold Rush, when gold diggers jousted over the most lucrative places to sift ore. But he was confident that the new competitors would reach compromises.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be bad players per se, but there could be arguments over areas of operation overlap,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those are problems for the future, and that\u2019ll be a great problem to have.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the last time a spacecraft brought moon rocks back to Earth. It was a Soviet probe in 1976, not the last of NASA\u2019s Apollo missions. Additionally a picture used in an earlier version of this article misidentified the location of a visit by the Hereditary Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg. It was from their visit of SSL in California, not an earlier stop at Planetary Resources in Washington State.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Tax Plan: How to Make Sense of the Push in Congress", "Date": null, "News": "Advertisement\nThe idea of tax cuts has always been popular, but if the system doesn\u2019t bring in enough revenue to pay for necessities \u2014 soldiers\u2019 salaries, highway construction and disaster relief, among others \u2014 then the changes could undercut economic growth and the standard of living.A far-reaching tax bill like the ones now being considered would touch nearly every American and every business in small ways and large. There are proposals that could affect how much it costs you to buy a house, care for a sick relative, adopt a child and send a child to private school.Several analyses, including one from the Congressional Budget Office this week, have said that the Senate bill would hurt workers earning less than $30,000 a year, while delivering benefits to the highest earners throughout the next decade.By 2027, the budget office said, Americans earning $75,000 a year and below would, as a group, see their taxes increase as cuts expire.Here are three main proposals that would affect individuals and households:Eliminate individual health-care mandate.Change the number of income brackets.The House bill reduces the seven current marginal income tax brackets to four: 12, 25, 35 and 39.6 percent. The Senate bill would retain seven brackets with reduced marginal rates: 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35 and 38.5 percent.Increase the standard deduction.Here are three main proposals that would affect businesses:Slash the top corporate rate to 20%.The idea in bringing down the rate from 35 percent is to help American corporations compete better with foreign rivals, which are subjected to lower tax rates, and discourage homegrown businesses from moving to lower-tax havens abroad.Transform the way global profits are taxed.Under the current system, all profits are subject to domestic taxes, but the House and Senate bills would fence off the money that multinationals earn outside the United States.Provide a tax cut to \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses.Most American businesses are organized not as corporations but as \u201cpass-through\u201d entities like partnerships and proprietorships, where the income is passed along to their owners and then taxed under the individual income tax system.No matter the intention, all the proposals carry a risk that vague language and incomplete safeguards would open up lots of opportunities for businesses and wealthy investors and proprietors to avoid paying the taxes they owe. That not only undermines confidence in the entire system, but also raises the burden on other taxpayers who don\u2019t have the same opportunities.As for the international provisions, critics worry that freeing companies from taxes earned outside the United States would make it even more attractive for firms to send jobs, operations and profits overseas.Republicans argue that their tax cuts would unleash enormous growth: Companies and individuals would have more to spend and invest, which would spur expansion and job creation. All that growth, supporters argue, would help blunt the reduced amount of revenue collected because of various proposed tax cuts.But opponents have argued that there is little historical evidence that tax cuts lead to sustained growth, and most economists say cuts financed by deficits have the potential to undermine growth.Republicans are aggressively marketing their plan as a \u201cmiddle-class tax cut\u201d that would benefit everyone. Several independent analyses agree, however, that the overwhelmingly majority of the financial gains would go to the wealthiest Americans.Normally, once both chambers pass a bill, the serious horse-trading would begin behind closed doors. A small group of representatives and senators would get together to work out differences between the two versions in what\u2019s known as a conference. The final bill would only allow members to vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201dBut the White House may try to push a strategy of incorporating whatever changes need to be made to satisfy House Republicans while the bill is still pending in the Senate, so that the House could simply approve the Senate version and send the bill directly to Mr. Trump for his signature \u2014 perhaps in time for Christmas.Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.A graphic with an earlier version of this article mislabled the percentage of people earning less than $30,000 whose tax burden would increase next year under the Senate plan. It would be 1 percent of those people, not 3 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House to Vote on Child Health Care, but Funding Will Remain in Limbo", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Friday is expected to pass legislation to refinance the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and send federal funds to community health centers. But a partisan morass over how to pay for the legislation all but ensures that state governments and millions of children will get little relief from the uncertainty that has faced the programs since funding officially expired a month ago.For two decades, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, has provided prescription medicines, checkups and hospital care to low- to moderate-income children with broad bipartisan support. But the program has been in limbo since Oct. 1, and House action will not end the logjam \u2014 a testament to the level of partisan rancor that grips Washington.The Senate will almost certainly balk at the House bill, which is likely to pass largely along party lines.Unsure when Congress will provide more funds, some states have begun drafting notices to inform families that they could lose coverage. And lawmakers have shown little urgency in responding.\u201cIt\u2019s very discouraging that Congress has reached this level of dysfunction and has so much difficulty extending a bipartisan program that has been so successful,\u201d said Joan C. Alker, the executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University.About 4.7 percent of children under 19 were uninsured last year, down by about two-thirds from 1997, when the child health program was created. More than eight million children are insured through CHIP.\u201cWe know that states are going to run out of money pretty quickly,\u201d Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, the chief author of the bill to pump money into CHIP, said this week. \u201cThey are pounding on our door, as they should.\u201dRepublicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate have agreed to provide money for the child health program for five years and for community health centers \u2014 another popular program \u2014 for two years. They have also agreed to delay cuts in federal payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of uninsured and Medicaid patients.But the question of how to pay for these measures, a cost of roughly $23 billion, has made further progress uncertain.House Republicans want to take money from a fund created by the Affordable Care Act that pays for a wide range of public health efforts, like preventing diabetes, vaccinating children, reducing the use of tobacco and fighting the opioid epidemic.To help offset the cost of new spending, the House Republican bill would shorten the grace period for consumers who fail to pay their share of premiums for health insurance purchased through a marketplace established under the Affordable Care Act. Several hundred thousand people could lose coverage as a result, and the government would save money because it would no longer subsidize their insurance, the Congressional Budget Office says.Republicans say that some states have used the prevention fund as a slush fund, and that some consumers have abused the grace period to obtain a full year\u2019s coverage while paying premiums for only nine months.Democrats are outraged that Republicans insist on offsetting every dollar of new spending on the child health program while pushing a tax bill that could add as much as $1.5 trillion to federal budget deficits over 10 years.\u201cNone of the tax cuts being talked about are paid for,\u201d said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California.Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said the bill effectively pays for two worthy health programs by undermining the Affordable Care Act.\u201cThis is robbing Peter to pay Paul,\u201d Mr. Pallone said. \u201cRepublicans are taking money from the Prevention and Public Health Fund to pay for CHIP and community health centers.\u201dOn the other side of the Capitol, senators have been working in a spirit of bipartisan comity, though they too have not agreed on how to pay for CHIP and community health centers. They are unlikely to accept the cuts in the House Republican bill.The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, takes immense pride in having created the child health program in collaboration with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, in 1997, when Bill Clinton was president and Republicans controlled both houses of Congress. Mr. Hatch is working now with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the committee.The last three presidents, Mr. Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, were ardent supporters of community health centers. But funds for that program were allowed to expire last month.Dr. Neil S. Calman, the president and chief executive of the Institute for Family Health, which operates 31 community health centers in New York, said the uncertainty over federal funding \u201caffects every decision\u201d he makes. He has deferred hiring doctors and nurses and put off purchases of dental chairs and other equipment because \u201cwe know we soon won\u2019t have the money.\u201d\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why the parties can\u2019t get together to figure out how to provide the money for a program they both support,\u201d Dr. Calman said.While Congress squabbles, state officials agonize over the uncertainty.Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, said the state expected to exhaust its CHIP funds in January or early February and was already making preparations because state law requires officials to notify families at least 30 days before coverage is ended. The Texas program covers more than 400,000 children.Cathy Caldwell, director of the CHIP program in Alabama, said state officials would have to revise computer eligibility systems, notify families and perform many other tasks before funds run out in February or March. \u201cWith such a short timeline,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how we could get it all done.\u201d\u201cWe assume that funding will be continued,\u201d Ms. Caldwell said. \u201cBut we have a great fear. What if it\u2019s not? There would be real disruption.\u201dNathan Checketts, the deputy director of the Utah Health Department, said he was confident that Congress and President Trump would eventually fund the program, but he was not sure they would act in time to prevent a gap in coverage for children.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kremlin Cash Behind Billionaire\u2019s Twitter and Facebook Investments", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "The Paradise PapersLeaked files show that a state-controlled bank in Moscow helped to fuel Yuri Milner\u2019s ascent in Silicon Valley, where the Russia investigation has put tech companies under scrutiny.Supported byNow, leaked documents examined by The New York Times offer a partial answer: Behind Mr. Milner\u2019s investments in Facebook and Twitter were hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kremlin.Obscured by a maze of offshore shell companies, the Twitter investment was backed by VTB, a Russian state-controlled bank often used for politically strategic deals.Ultimately, Mr. Milner\u2019s companies came to own more than 8 percent of Facebook and 5 percent of Twitter, helping earn him a place on various lists of the world\u2019s most powerful business people. His companies sold those holdings several years ago, but he retains investments in several other large technology companies and continues to make new deals. Among Mr. Milner\u2019s current investments is a real estate venture founded and partly owned by Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and White House adviser.Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites have become a major focus of federal investigations into Kremlin interference in the 2016 election. Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators are examining how Russians linked to the Kremlin turned the sites into garden hoses of bogus news stories and divisive political ads, and whether they coordinated with the Trump campaign.No one has suggested that Mr. Milner or his companies had any connection to the propaganda operation. For his part, Mr. Milner said in a pair of recent interviews that the Russian government money was no different from the financing he had received from his many other investors around the world.Even so, his use of the state-directed apparatus employed by so many Russian oligarchs to enrich themselves shows how the Kremlin has extended its long financial arm not only to his company but to some of America\u2019s technology giants.\u201cKremlin-connected institutions make investments with strategic interests in mind \u2014 not just commercial interests but state interests as well,\u201d said Michael Carpenter, the Russia director at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. \u201cThey go hand in hand.\u201dMr. Carpenter added, \u201cOligarchs who receive significant amounts of financial support from Russian banks like VTB or Sberbank or Gazprombank have to pass above a political threshold, meaning such support requires the explicit or tacit approval of those at the top of Russia\u2019s crony capitalist system.\u201dThere is nothing illegal about foreign state-owned institutions investing in American companies. VTB and Gazprom said the transactions were both sound investments, not motivated by political considerations.As Mr. Milner sees it, the story is similarly simple \u2014 \u201cnothing more than business,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe are getting money, and we are putting them in Facebook and Twitter. We are making money for our limited partners, and we are giving money back to them. For me, it\u2019s a commercial arrangement.\u201dMr. Milner, 55, studied theoretical physics at Moscow State University before moving to the United States, where he attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1990s and then worked for the World Bank in Washington.Mr. Milner eventually teamed with Alisher Usmanov \u2014 an Uzbek-Russian oligarch close to the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev \u2014 and a former Goldman Sachs executive to build a large stake in Mail.ru, a Russian internet company that now trades on the London Stock Exchange.Mr. Milner\u2019s initial American investments came as he served on an innovation commission set up in 2009 by Mr. Medvedev, who was Russia\u2019s president at the time and is something of a tech enthusiast, famously touring Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., with Steve Jobs.In May 2009, Facebook announced an investment of roughly $200 million by Mr. Milner\u2019s company, Digital Sky Technologies, and said the company planned to spend at least $100 million buying additional stock. Eventually, Mr. Milner\u2019s new venture capital firm, DST Global, also amassed a significant stake in Facebook.\u201cA number of firms approached us, but DST stood out because of the global perspective they bring,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said at the time.The documents reviewed by The Times reveal that DST brought something else as well: a connection \u2014 through a succession of shell companies \u2014 to the Kremlin.In those years, as part of its diplomatic \u201creset\u201d with Moscow, the Obama administration was encouraging Russia to learn from the American technology industry. Importing tech knowledge, the theory went, would ease Russia\u2019s dependence on exporting oil and gas.For the Facebook deal, it was Gazprom, the state-controlled natural-gas giant, that became the bridge. The company, a vital component of the Putin government, has employed its financial subsidiary, Gazprom Investholding, to reclaim assets privatized during the 1990s.Gazprom Investholding is \u201cused for politically important and strategically important deals for the Kremlin,\u201d said Ilya Zaslavskiy, a contributor to the Kleptocracy Initiative, a project of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. Both VTB and Gazprom Investholding\u2019s parent, Gazprom, are under United States sanctions stemming from Russia\u2019s support of separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.Kanton, based in the British Virgin Islands, had numerous ties to Mr. Milner\u2019s backer, Mr. Usmanov.Kanton was owned by a longtime Usmanov business associate, and was controlled by Matthias Bolliger, a director of numerous subsidiaries of Mr. Usmanov\u2019s main holding company, USM Holdings, according to an Appleby memo and the Panama Papers. And an email sent by a trust company on the Isle of Man used by Mr. Usmanov referred to Kanton as a \u201cprivate investment company, (facebook and twitter).\u201dIn the interviews, Mr. Milner said his investors\u2019 identities were not generally public information. And he sought to distance his company from Mr. Usmanov. \u201cI had no knowledge of him using state funds to invest with us,\u201d he said. What\u2019s more, he said, Mr. Usmanov had many potential sources of financing, making it impossible to know whether money from Gazprom Investholding was even used to finance his stake in Facebook.To demonstrate this, Mr. Milner set out a series of clear plastic cups with labels like \u201cAlleged Russian government funds,\u201d \u201cMr. Usmanov\u201d and \u201cFacebook.\u201d He pulled out a large bag of green M&M\u2019s, filled several cups and proceeded to shift the M&M\u2019s from one cup to another. \u201cMoney is fungible,\u201d he explained, adding, \u201cYou can\u2019t just say that this specific dollar went all the way to Facebook.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Usmanov, Rollo Head, did not address specific questions. But in a statement, he insisted that there are clear streams of money that do not mingle. Mr. Usmanov, he said, \u201cdid not borrow from or use state or quasi-state funds to make investments in Facebook.\u201dThe Facebook deal was a case study in the way Russia\u2019s oligarchs have mixed public and private roles for their own, and their government\u2019s, benefit: Even as he was investing in Facebook, Mr. Usmanov was general director of Gazprom Investholding.In fact, Mr. Usmanov had often intertwined his government position with his personal deals, according to a report by the global investigations and security firm Kroll. Kroll described those arrangements as \u201csynergies.\u201dThe Kroll report \u2014 a \u201creputation audit\u201d \u2014 had been commissioned by Mr. Usmanov as he set out to burnish his image a year before his deal with Mr. Milner to invest in Facebook. Kroll investigators, relying on public records and interviews, detailed a long and colorful history: time in prison in Uzbekistan (he was later exonerated) and past associations with alleged Russian organized crime figures, according to a draft copy of the report reviewed by The Times.The investigators also recounted a dizzying number of deals \u2014 involving mining, media and technology companies, often with the assistance of the Kremlin and Mr. Medvedev. \u201cUsmanov looks set to end the Putin era as the \u2018most improved\u2019 oligarch over the past eight years,\u201d one source told Kroll.Kroll investigators found that, for some investments, Mr. Usmanov turned to Kanton, the company that would be a part of Mr. Milner\u2019s Facebook investment.A Facebook spokeswoman, Vanessa Chan, declined to answer specific questions about the deal with DST, calling it a \u201cpassive investor\u201d and noting that the company had invested and cashed out several years ago.Gazprom Investholding called the loans \u201cprudent,\u201d saying they were \u201cprovided for general corporate purposes\u201d at above-market rates. The company did not answer a question about what role, if any, Mr. Usmanov played in the loans, except to say that as its general director, he \u201coperated in accordance\u201d with the company\u2019s charter.To complete the Facebook deal, DST used a pair of lawyers based in Cyprus and Britain who have also set up offshore entities for Russian oligarchs close to Mr. Putin, according to the Panama Papers, United States securities filings and records from Appleby. DST did not answer questions about how it came to use the two lawyers.After the Facebook deal, Mr. Milner became a fixture in Silicon Valley, spending about $100 million on a 25,000-square-foot house in Los Altos Hills and investing $7 billion in more than 30 companies, including Spotify, Airbnb and Groupon.In interviews, he has referred to his close relationship to management at the companies in which he invests. Mr. Milner and Mr. Zuckerberg became friends and met monthly. Still, despite his company\u2019s sizable stake, Mr. Milner did not take a board seat or voting rights.At the 2010 technology conference in San Francisco, Mr. Milner was asked if he provided management with advice along with his cash. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually the opposite,\u201d he replied. \u201cI sometimes get informal advice from them.\u201dMr. Milner\u2019s roughly $380 million investment in Twitter was directly backed by another instrument of Kremlin power: Russia\u2019s second-largest bank, VTB.Sixty-one percent of the bank is owned by the Russian government. VTB\u2019s president, Andrey L. Kostin, is a former Soviet diplomat; Matthias Warnig, on the bank\u2019s supervisory council, is a former East German spy who served in Dresden while Mr. Putin was stationed there with the K.G.B.Last year, the Panama Papers revealed that a Cyprus bank owned by VTB was used to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to accounts connected to Sergei Roldugin, a cellist and close friend of Mr. Putin. It was unknown what the money was for, but some speculated that he was working as a frontman for Kremlin insiders.Mr. Roldugin did not respond to messages for this article, but said at the time that his wealth came through donations from rich businessmen for the purchase of musical instruments. VTB called the account in the Panama Papers \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d\u201cVTB is really a slush fund for Putin,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, and an early economic adviser to the post-Soviet Russian government. The bank, he added, is \u201cthe black cashier of the Putin crowd.\u201dMr. Milner\u2019s Twitter deal is a complex web of share transfers and offshore financial entities. But its details may offer clues that there was a strategic motive behind VTB\u2019s involvement.In July 2011, VTB invested at least $191 million in exchange for shares of an Isle of Man company called DST Investments 3, corporate records show. That offshore vehicle was used to buy roughly half of DST Global\u2019s stake in Twitter that month. DST Investments 3 also issued shares to Kanton, the company linked to Mr. Usmanov that was at the center of the Facebook deal.The Twitter deal had a notable feature: VTB put virtually all of the cash into DST Investments 3, filings show. Kanton contributed almost none. It is highly unusual for investors in DST funds to get stakes without contributing cash, according to a person familiar with the matter.On May 7, 2014 \u2014 six months after Twitter\u2019s initial public offering, when insiders were first permitted to sell their shares \u2014 VTB transferred the bulk of its stake in DST Investments 3 to Kanton. DST also cashed out its Twitter investment.DST had one other investment from VTB, which Mr. Milner compared to a sovereign wealth fund. VTB was an investor in the Chinese internet company JD.com as recently as February 2015, when it transferred its stake to Kanton, Isle of Man records show.In a statement, VTB said its involvement with Twitter was \u201csolely a financial investment,\u201d sold for a profit, one of several successful deals in the high-tech industry in that period. The bank added, \u201cVTB is a solely commercial bank, we have never had any politically motivated deals.\u201dTwitter declined to answer a series of questions about VTB, but said that as a matter of policy it had done reviews of all pre-I.P.O. investors.Mr. Milner would not discuss how VTB came to be an investor, other than to say that the bank helped take Mail.ru public in 2010. According to the Kroll report, the Kremlin had previously ordered VTB to finance other ventures of Mr. Usmanov. The report also details the close relationship between Mr. Usmanov and Mr. Medvedev, finding that Mr. Medvedev helped him win a bid for a lucrative copper ore deposit in Siberia.Mr. Milner said he invested $850,000 in Cadre through a trust, which in turn controls DST Global Advisers, DST Global\u2019s investment management firm. He said he was introduced to the company through an early investor whose name he did not remember. He said he met Jared Kushner only once, at a conference in Aspen, Colo.Mr. Kushner and Cadre declined to comment.In his interviews with The Times, Mr. Milner shied away from the controversy now enveloping Facebook and Twitter, his former major investments.Growing up in the Soviet Union, he said, \u201cif you\u2019re a father and you have a conversation with your son, it\u2019s easy to say, \u2018Please don\u2019t get involved in politics.\u2019\u201dThat \u201cwas my principle back then and still now,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI prefer just to focus on business and philanthropy. And this is plenty for me.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a Facebook spokeswoman. She is Vanessa Chan, not Chen.Katie Benner, Conor Dougherty and Andrew E.

{"Headline": "Citigroup, Twitter, Lyft: Prince\u2019s Arrest Touches Many", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmong Prince Alwaleed\u2019s crown jewels: sizable stakes in Twitter, Lyft and Citigroup. He has gone into business with some of the corporate world\u2019s biggest titans, including Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and Michael R. Bloomberg.His investments span the globe, including the Four Seasons Hotel George V in Paris, the Savoy in London and the Plaza in New York. He has also invested in the AccorHotels chain and Canary Wharf, the London business development.So vast are his investments that he has been referred to as the Warren Buffett of the Middle East.Prince Alwaleed\u2019s arrest is likely to reverberate across dozens of companies around the world that count the investment company that he founded, Kingdom Holding, as a major investor or shareholder.The arrests appeared to be the crown prince\u2019s latest step to make good on his ambitious modernization plans and to further consolidate the remarkable degree of power he has amassed at age 32 over military, foreign, economic and social policies. His ascent and brash approach have angered some members of the royal family.Prince Alwaleed, a 62-year-old with an Omar Sharif mustache, ubiquitous sunshades and penchant for publicity, is a relatively flamboyant figure for the royal family and is one of the most prominent Saudis internationally. His arrest seems aimed at demonstrating that no one is beyond the reach of the committee and the crown prince.The confinement of the princes, said to be in the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh, could be a particularly strange experience for Prince Alwaleed, who owns stakes in a number of Four Seasons hotels.Set to action-movie music, much of the video unfolds against the backdrop of his 280-foot yacht, the Kingdom 5KR.During the trip, the prince, who already owns several dozen hotels in Egypt, announced a further $800 million investment in the country\u2019s tourism industry. He drew criticism from some conservative Egyptians for a video that showed him meeting with Egypt\u2019s female minister of investment and international cooperation, Sahar Nasr, aboard his yacht while he was again wearing shorts. It was unusual protocol in a public meeting for a member of the family that rules a hyperconservative Islamic kingdom.The arrests also come as Crown Prince Mohammed has forged a close relationship with President Trump, who shares his aggressive approach to Saudi\u2019s regional rival, Iran, and his penchant for bold decisions.But despite his wealth, Prince Alwaleed was not seen as particularly powerful within the Saudi royal family or as a threat to the crown prince\u2019s consolidation of power. His father, Prince Talal, known as the \u201cRed Prince,\u201d spent years in exile after leading a kind of leftist revolt among royals in 1962, and had grumbled in the past about being passed over in the royal succession. Prince Alwaleed himself initially objected to the naming of Mohammed as crown prince, though he quickly stopped complaining in public.A more likely reason for his inclusion in the arrests, experts said, is that he might have gone bankrupt during the 2008 financial crisis. He had been highly leveraged and somehow got elements of the government to bail him out, through his connections to then-King Abdullah and the finance minister, who is also said to have been arrested. Prince Alwaleed\u2019s son Prince Khaled is married to the minister\u2019s daughter.\u201cThey must have uncovered evidence of irregular activity and wanted to make an example of him,\u201d Ali Shihabi, founder of the independent Arabia Foundation in Washington, said on Sunday from Abu Dhabi in a telephone interview.Others said there was bad blood between Prince Alwaleed and the crown prince. A former United States ambassador, Chas W. Freeman Jr., said it could be that Prince Alwaleed \u201chas been strongly identified in Saudi with civil society, which is by its very nature a counter to concentration of power.\u201d\u201cHe has a reputation,\u201d Mr. Freeman said, \u201cfor being quite outspoken and blunt and being critical of other parts of the royal family \u2014 and he\u2019s not well liked.\u201dOthers said they were surprised at the takedown of someone who has been an ambassador to international business.\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything about Alwaleed being politically active in a way that would threaten M.B.S.,\u201d said F. Gregory Gause III, an expert on Saudi Arabia and a professor at Texas A&M University, referring to the crown prince by his initials.Saudi Arabia is also trying to diversify its economy, a top priority of the crown prince. The kingdom is planning to list the state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco next year in what is expected to be the biggest initial public offering in history.He comes across in person as relaxed, not formal or rigid, and focused on business. A New York Times reporter who visited his office years ago found towering pictures of his daughter, without a head scarf. The prince\u2019s welcome was typical of his grand gestures: He presented the reporter, visiting in the days before the internet, with a full-length printout of The Times.More recently, Prince Alwaleed made early bets on some of the technology world\u2019s biggest stars, earning him handsome returns. He bought a strategic stake in JD.com, a Chinese online retailer, anticipating China\u2019s emergence as a vast e-commerce market.In moments of corporate crises, Prince Alwaleed has stepped in to tip the balance.When the phone hacking scandal rocked a London tabloid owned by the Murdochs, the prince went on the BBC to say that Rebekah Brooks, then the chief executive of the British unit of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation, should resign. \u201cYou bet she has to go,\u201d he said in July 2011. She resigned the next day.At the time, Prince Alwaleed was the second-biggest shareholder in News Corporation, with a more than 6 percent stake. He later sold most of his stake in the company.In the darkest hours of the 2008 financial crisis, Prince Alwaleed said he would increase his stake in Citigroup \u2014 a move of solidarity with the then-embattled bank\u2019s chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit.Prince Alwaleed has worked closely with some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest and best known banks and investors.Just a month ago, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, sat across from Prince Alwaleed at a meeting in Riyadh. The two talked about investments and economic developments in the Middle East. A longtime banker for Kingdom Holding, Goldman Sachs recently helped Prince Alwaleed\u2019s company acquire a 16 percent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi, the Saudi bank.Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and former government official who fled into exile during the summer, said Prince Alwaleed had lately become a vocal supporter of the crown prince\u2019s economic reforms and tried to persuade him to return to the country. Mr. Khashoggi said the prince sent him a text message saying, \u201cAn enlightened mind like you should be with us now building the fourth Saudi state under Mohammed bin Salman.\u201dBut Prince Mohammad appeared to have been keeping his distance, delaying four months before granting a requested meeting, Mr. Khashoggi said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m sure that hurt him. But Alwaleed is royalist. He believes in the solidarity of the royal family.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong, Anne Barnard from Beirut, Lebanon, and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow.

{"Headline": "An Alabama Senate Candidate Keeps Democratic Leaders Away \u2014 but Not Their Money", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNational Democratic groups have not spent a dollar on their own television or radio commercials promoting Mr. Jones, a former federal prosecutor. The party\u2019s most popular campaigners, such as former President Barack Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, have not set foot in the state. As Republicans in Washington pressure Mr. Moore to leave the race \u2014 with the Republican National Committee pulling its financing on Tuesday \u2014 Democratic leaders convey a stark public message to Mr. Jones: You\u2019re on your own.\u201cIt\u2019s an Alabama race,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said at a news conference on Monday, repeating the phrase three times for emphasis.But the national Democrats\u2019 ostensibly arm\u2019s-length treatment of Mr. Jones belies a far deeper investment in the race. Senate Democrats covet Alabama\u2019s Senate seat, passionately, but, as Mr. Schumer demonstrated, they are acutely aware of the risk of being seen as orchestrating the race from afar.As Mr. Jones has gained ground against Mr. Moore, Democrats have taken measured steps to shore up his candidacy, helping Mr. Jones raise money and battering Republicans who have been slow to denounce their party\u2019s embattled nominee. Several liberal activist groups have begun deploying organizers to Alabama to help prepare get-out-the-vote efforts for Mr. Jones in the Dec. 12 election.And far from being shunned by the party, Mr. Jones\u2019s top advisers have been open about which direction the shunning is going.\u201cStay home, this is our race and we\u2019ll decide it here,\u201d said Giles Perkins, a former Alabama Democratic Party chairman and one of Mr. Jones\u2019s strategists.Mr. Jones also has a political network of his own to draw on in the race, and the few outsiders to stump for him have been personal acquaintances. Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights legend who got to know Mr. Jones as a United States attorney, campaigned for him this month. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. rallied Democrats in Birmingham for Mr. Jones in October \u2014 Mr. Jones led Mr. Biden\u2019s 1988 presidential campaign in Alabama.Former Representative Parker Griffith, a conservative Democrat, said he spoke to Mr. Jones over the last few days and found him quiet and circumspect about the impact of the Moore scandal: \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s see how this plays out.\u2019\u201dMr. Griffith, who briefly became a Republican during the 2010 campaign, said Mr. Jones was still struggling against Alabama\u2019s intense suspicion of the Democratic label. He said even bringing in Mr. Biden may have been a mistake.\u201cThe Democratic brand, in Alabama, is poisonous,\u201d Mr. Griffith said, adding: \u201cSome of us said, my God, when you see Biden, you see Obama.\u201dFor now, most Democratic leaders are happy to stay out. For all his public caution, Mr. Schumer has been effusive about the Alabama campaign in private, according to people who have spoken with him. Mr. Schumer has told allies he believes the race is now clearly winnable for Mr. Jones, but that Democrats must take pains not to nationalize the contest in a way that might offend voters in a deeply conservative state.Still, in front of reporters, Mr. Schumer could not fully contain his excitement this week about the prospect of snatching away a Senate seat in one of the country\u2019s reddest states. He gushed about Mr. Jones\u2019s financial dominance over Mr. Moore, who has struggled to rally Republican donors.\u201cThe amount of money that\u2019s come in, even before the Moore scandal, is enormous,\u201d Mr. Schumer exclaimed.If the Republican Party\u2019s national reputation appears to hinge on the fate of Mr. Moore\u2019s candidacy, the stakes in Alabama have grown nearly as high for Democrats. Democrats face forbidding Senate races in 2018, when they must defend several seats in Republican states and pick up three seats to win a majority in the chamber. At the moment, Democrats appear to have a good chance of winning only two Republican-held seats, in Nevada and Arizona.An upset in Alabama would change that, transforming the challenge of winning a Senate majority from a seemingly impossible task into merely an extremely difficult one.Mr. Jones\u2019s campaign seems to recognize the stakes: Flush with optimism, the Democrat has turned to a hold-the-ball approach since a number of women emerged to recount their experiences with Mr. Moore when they were teens.Mr. Jones decided not to travel to Washington on Tuesday night for a $500 per-person cocktail party fund-raiser headlined by such Democratic luminaries as Senator Kamala Harris and Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, because he saw no reason to do anything that could let Republicans redirect the focus of the campaign from Mr. Moore.Instead, Mr. Jones released campaign commercials featuring voters who said they were Republicans supporting his candidacy. One video implored Alabamians: \u201cDon\u2019t vote for the party. Vote for the man.\u201dAnd discussions among Democrats about bringing in former President Bill Clinton, who has his own history with sexual impropriety, have been shelved as part of Mr. Jones\u2019s attempt to keep a local focus for the duration of the campaign.Mr. Jones, however, has benefited for months from an unheralded campaign by Democrats in Washington to direct money to his campaign, fueling his strong advantage on television. Mr. Jones has aired nearly $2 million in commercials, compared with about $300,000 for Mr. Moore.This month, Representative Terri Sewell, the only Democrat in Alabama\u2019s federal delegation, hosted a fund-raising event for Mr. Jones at a townhouse that is home to the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, with Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, in attendance.Last weekend, as Mr. Moore fought for his political survival, the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights group, held a \u201cMimosas With a Purpose\u201d fund-raiser for Mr. Jones at a private home in Washington.State Representative Anthony Daniels, the Democratic leader in the Alabama House of Representatives, urged Mr. Jones to communicate an affirmative message about policy, rather than focusing on the accusations against Mr. Moore.\u201cThe best thing we can do is keep it positive and talk about where Doug stands, and where he is on the issues, and not get down in the mud,\u201d Mr. Daniels said.Beyond the plain value of winning the Senate seat, Democrats also sense a larger symbolic test in Alabama: Should Mr. Jones prove unable to defeat Mr. Moore, it would be a stark verdict on his party\u2019s limitations in the Deep South. Democrats have not won a major statewide election in Alabama since 2006, or elected one of their own to the Senate in a quarter-century.But Democrats believe the Moore scandal may have opened an unusually wide path to victory in a state that is typically polarized along racial lines. Mr. Perkins said many white voters would be newly willing to consider Mr. Jones.If not, Mr. Perkins said, \u201csome folks just aren\u2019t going to show up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With \u2018Dark,\u2019 a German Netflix Series, Streaming Crosses a New Border", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 At first glance, \u201cDark,\u201d Netflix\u2019s first original German-language series, might seem familiar to fans of the streaming service\u2019s other recent hits. The show, which will debut internationally on Dec. 1, centers on a small town plagued by strange goings-on at a nearby power facility. It also features an expansive cast of largely young actors, a time-warped structure and cryptic scenes of a teenager imprisoned in a brightly lit room.\u201cAll of the sudden there is an interest from the international audience,\u201d Mr. Odar said, \u201cthat, \u2018Oh, the Germans can do something more interesting than what they could do for many years.\u2019\u201d\u201cDark\u201d takes place in the fictional town of Winden (a play on the German word for \u201ctwists\u201d), whose forested surroundings are dominated by the cooling towers of a nuclear power plant. Its characters include Jonas Kahnwald (Louis Hofmann), a gloomy teenager still reeling from his father\u2019s suicide; Ulrich Nielsen (Oliver Masucci), a headstrong police officer having an affair with Jonas\u2019s mother; and Nielsen\u2019s wife, Katharina (J\u00f6rdis Triebel), who works at the local school. When a young boy disappears and a body is found in the woods, the resulting mystery seems to point to the nuclear plant.The rest of the lineup has long been heavy on political talk shows, middlebrow police dramas and second-rate TV movies. \u201cGermany has noticed that, when it comes to TV series, other countries are more advanced,\u201d Mr. Mikos said. \u201cNow people are trying to catch up.\u201dMr. Odar and Ms. Friese are aware that German television doesn\u2019t have the sexiest reputation. \u201cI think the perspective from outside is that we have very talented people working here, but what we\u2019ve been lacking is innovation,\u201d Ms. Friese said. They note that \u201cDark\u201d is a departure, not only because of its complex structure, but because it is a blend of two genres: crime and science fiction. \u201cThe problem is that Germans aren\u2019t really big with suspension of disbelief,\u201d Ms. Friese said. \u201cWe have to break this realism wall to create more innovative content.\u201d\u201cWe were uncool for a very long time,\u201d Mr. Odar said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s changing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Open Door for Pesticide Lobbyists at the U.S.D.A.", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump RulesAt a private meeting in September, congressional aides asked Rebeckah Adcock, a top official at the Department of Agriculture, to reveal the identities of the people serving on the deregulation team she leads at the agency.Teams like Ms. Adcock\u2019s, created under an executive order by President Trump, had been taking heat from Democratic lawmakers over their secrecy. What little was publicly known suggested that some of the groups\u2019 members had deep ties to the industries being regulated.Ms. Adcock, a former pesticide industry executive, brushed off the request, according to House aides familiar with the exchange, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. Making the names public, they recalled her saying, would trigger a deluge of lobbyists.In fact, interviews and visitor logs at the Agriculture Department showed that Ms. Adcock had already been meeting with lobbyists, including those from her former employer, the pesticide industry\u2019s main trade group, CropLife America, and its members. CropLife pushes the agenda of pesticide makers in Washington, including easing rules related to safety standards and clean water.Ms. Adcock, who left the trade group in April, maintained contact with her former industry allies despite a signed ethics agreement promising to avoid for one year issues involving CropLife as well as matters that she had lobbied about in the two years before joining the government.In one meeting, Ms. Adcock discussed issues banned by the ethics agreement with an executive who had been her lobbying partner weeks earlier at CropLife, according to the accounts of participants and the visitor logs, obtained through a public records request by The New York Times and ProPublica.Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the U.S.D.A. who also spoke on behalf of Ms. Adcock, said she had not violated her ethics agreement by meeting with her former industry allies. He also denied that Ms. Adcock had discussed issues related to her previous lobbying at the meeting, or that she had suggested that her deregulation team would be swamped by lobbyists if names of its members were released.\u201cThe career ethics officers at U.S.D.A. agree that this is not a violation of the ethics agreement that Rebeckah Adcock signed,\u201d said Mr. Murtaugh, citing a 2009 memo by the Office of Government Ethics.Others dispute that interpretation of the memo; the ethics office declined to say whether the memo applied to the meeting, citing its policy not to discuss individual cases.Ms. Adcock is scheduled to appear Tuesday before subcommittees of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which is tracking Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulation effort. In announcing the hearing, the committee, led by Republicans, applauded the deregulation teams for making an \u201cunprecedented reduction in the federal regulatory footprint.\u201dRepublican members of the committee declined to comment about Ms. Adcock\u2019s activities. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the top Democrat on the committee, said that if Ms. Adcock had violated her ethics agreement, it contributed \u201cto a troubling pattern of President Trump\u2019s failure to \u2018drain the swamp.\u2019\u201dRebeckah Adcock, a former lobbyist for CropLife America, a trade group representing the pesticide industry, has agreed not to participate in matters involving her former employer.In February, Mr. Trump ordered major federal agencies to set up the deregulation teams, to fulfill a campaign promise to cut red tape for businesses. Corporations and industry groups quickly hired lawyers, lobbyists and economists to help them influence the process with billions of dollars at stake. The regulations under review cover a range of subjects, including the cleanliness of drinking water and the safety of highways.The Trump administration has declined to make public the names of many members of the teams. It has also generally not provided records related to the teams\u2019 calendars and correspondence.A joint investigation published in July by The Times and ProPublica found that the teams included former employees of industry-financed organizations that oppose environmental regulations; lawyers who have represented companies in cases against federal regulators; and staff members of so-called political dark-money groups. Some are reviewing rules that their previous employers sought to weaken or kill, and at least two may be positioned to profit personally if certain regulations are undone. In all, the two news organizations have identified 112 current and former team members, including 41 with potential conflicts.At the meeting on Capitol Hill in September, Ms. Adcock lamented the scrutiny that her team was under, a House aide familiar with the exchange said. Ms. Adcock cited, in particular, public records requests for calendars and emails.The Times and ProPublica asked for those records this year and have received only a few. Most other federal agencies have been similarly unresponsive. The visitor logs that have been obtained are often handwritten sign-in sheets. They appear to show only a fraction of meetings, and many are illegible. It is not known from the logs, for example, if Ms. Adcock or her team had met with environmental or science groups in addition to the industry representatives.An examination of the Trump administration\u2019s deregulation teams has revealed a string of possible conflicts, including some appointees who may be reviewing rules their previous employers tried to weaken or kill.In response to questions from reporters about possible conflicts of interest, agency officials across the government have said the deregulation teams are abiding by strict ethical standards, including rules that bar them from working on issues directly affecting recent employers.Records received through a Freedom of Information Act request show that Ms. Adcock entered such an agreement on April 26, pledging that she would \u201cnot participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I know CropLife America is a party or represents a party\u201d for a year.But in May, Kellie Bray, a lobbyist for CropLife, arrived for a meeting with Ms. Adcock, according to the visitor logs.The two knew each other well. From 2010 to early this year, Ms. Adcock and Ms. Bray lobbied together for CropLife, which represents Syngenta and Monsanto, among other pesticide makers.Disclosure records show that during those years the two advocated for the industry\u2019s agenda at agencies, including the U.S.D.A. and the Environmental Protection Agency, and in Congress. They pushed CropLife\u2019s interests on bills and regulations relating to the impact of pesticides on water and human health.Ms. Adcock\u2019s departure from CropLife left the trade association short a seasoned lobbyist, but gave it a valuable contact in the top ranks of the U.S.D.A.Ms. Bray said in an interview that in May, Ms. Adcock had met with her and the Southern Crop Production Association, a CropLife affiliate. Ms. Bray said she had sat in on the meeting but hadn\u2019t talked.\u201cI facilitated the introduction,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is all.\u201dAfter the meeting, the Southern Crop Production Association, which represents pesticide manufacturers, formulators and distributors across the South, said on its website that \u201cRebeckah has an exceptional understanding regarding the many issues facing agriculture due, in large part, to her previous position with CLA,\u201d using the acronym for CropLife America.Among the topics discussed, according to the trade group\u2019s website, were the tests that pesticides must undergo to prove they are safe and rules governing their use near water sources. The trade group did not respond to requests for comment. Ms. Bray confirmed that the group had discussed regulations about the use of pesticides near water.Discussing policy related to the impact of pesticides on water is deemed off limits under Ms. Adcock\u2019s ethics agreement. Mr. Murtaugh, the U.S.D.A. spokesman, said Ms. Adcock disputed that she had discussed any off-limits subject.\u201cIf any participant declared concern regarding any issue precluded by Ms. Adcock\u2019s agreement, she politely and firmly instructed them it was not a matter she could discuss or assist with,\u201d he said.He also said Ms. Adcock had instructed Ms. Bray not to participate in the meeting and did not recall her being in the room.Mr. Murtaugh said a provision in the memorandum from the Office of Government Ethics allowed an appointee like Ms. Adcock to attend meetings with a former employer or client so long as five or more other stakeholders participated. In the May meeting, he said, four of the Southern Crop Production Association representatives were affiliated with individual companies: Syngenta, Albaugh, Triangle Chemical and Crop Production Services.However, three of those companies are also members of the CropLife trade group, Ms. Adcock\u2019s former employer. And they were attending in their capacity as the executive committee of the Southern Crop Production Association, according to the association\u2019s website, not as individual company executives.Walter M. Shaub Jr., who headed the Office of Government Ethics under President Barack Obama and during the early months of the Trump administration, said the provision cited by the U.S.D.A. did not apply to the ethics regulation in Ms. Adcock\u2019s agreement. Even if it did apply, he said, the meeting lacked a necessary diversity because the participants were all affiliated with one trade group. He also said it was irrelevant that Ms. Bray hadn\u2019t spoken.\u201cIf she brought them there, signed into the sign-in log, attended the meeting that she may or may not have set up, it definitely counts as a meeting with her,\u201d said Mr. Shaub, who has been critical of the Trump administration.Before Ms. Adcock worked at CropLife, she served as a lobbyist for the farming industry at the American Farm Bureau Federation. Among its donors is Farm Credit, a lending institution. In July, Ms. Adcock met with a delegation from Farm Credit, according to a participant.One of the executives who attended \u2014 Jeremy Brown, president of Broadview Agriculture, a Texas cotton producer \u2014 said in an interview that he knew Ms. Adcock from the Farm Bureau. For those who did not know her, Ms. Adcock explained her past lobbying on behalf of the farming industry, and she asked for recommendations on regulatory changes, he said.\u201cAny time you have people already familiar with the industry, it helps,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThey can hopefully get their feet on the ground and get the work in.\u201dHe said he had pushed Ms. Adcock to get cottonseed reclassified as an oil seed crop so cotton producers could be eligible again for certain government subsidies if revenue dropped. He also discussed what he termed overreach on clean-water rules.\u201cShe was taking notes, being really receptive,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Another highlight, he said, was the access the group enjoyed. Never before had he attended a meeting in the private gathering room just outside the office of the secretary of agriculture.\u201cI\u2019ve been to the U.S.D.A. a couple other times,\u201d Mr. Brown said, \u201cand this was the first time I\u2019ve been able to go to what they call the Cage.\u201dRobert Faturechi is a reporter at ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit investigative journalism organization that collaborated on this article.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Louvre Abu Dhabi, a Cultural Cornerstone Where East Meets West", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "The Emirates\u2019 aim: to promote the capital as a tolerant global city, and its flagship museum, opening this week, as a bridge between civilizations.Supported byABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 A decade ago the French architect Jean Nouvel sketched the bare outlines of a fretted dome on flimsy paper. Today this enormous metallic-silver canopy rises over desert sands and the Persian Gulf \u2014 marking the new Louvre Abu Dhabi museum and the global ambitions of France and the United Arab Emirates to deploy art as a diplomatic tool they call \u201csoft power.\u201dThe vast dome and clusters of waterfront galleries beneath it will open to the public on Nov. 11, with sunlight cascading through a lacework of stainless steel and aluminum and layers of star-shaped patterns. It\u2019s been a long wait for those thousands of stars to align \u2014 with five years of construction delays and technical challenges to build the estimated $650 million flagship on Saadiyat Island, by a lagoon near this capital city.And the museum\u2019s history is also turbulent \u2014 a saga of economic downturn, collapsing oil prices, regional political tensions and fierce French intellectual debates about the risks of lending its national treasures to the Middle East in exchange for petrodollars. Through it all the Louvre Abu Dhabi has brought together East and West and also managed to unite France\u2019s fractious national museums, which submerged envy and ego to cooperate on the project brokered by two governments.\u201cAlthough a lot has changed, not a lot has changed here,\u201d said Mr. Nouvel, inspecting the museum \u201cvillage\u201d last week, where workmen rushed to plant garden blooms and dig one courtyard for a Rodin sculpture recently arrived from France. \u201cThe principle is that it remains a museum that belongs to the geography, and culture and identity of the country.\u201dIn return, 17 French museums and institutions shipped 300 art works here this year, from Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s portrait of \u201cLa Belle Ferronni\u00e8re\u201d to massive marble nymphs from Versailles. French museum experts are also advising the Emiratis on what to acquire and organizing temporary exhibitions for up to 15 years.\u201cSoft power is now the catchword of all diplomats\u201d\u00a8 said Zaki Anwar Nusseibeh, the U.A.E. minister of state, who was an adviser from the beginning when the museum was simply a sketch and its future site was inhabited by nesting turtles and seashells. \u201cIt means it is no longer sufficient to have military or economic power if you are not able to share your values. Exchange \u2014 this is what soft power is about.\u201dThe public opening on Saturday \u2014 with an appearance on Wednesday by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and flyovers with the Louvre\u2019s name on the wings of the country\u2019s national Etihad airlines \u2014 comes as the monarchy is also engaged in a diplomatic boycott of neighboring Qatar, over allegations that Qatar supports extremists.Mr. Nusseibeh, the state minister, said his government considers the Louvre Abu Dhabi part of a cultural strategy to counter tensions in the region. The Emirates\u2019 ultimate aim is to promote the capital as a tolerant global city, and its flagship museum as a bridge between civilizations.\u201cThe priority is to invest heavily in education and culture,\u201d he said, speaking at his art-filled country home outside Abu Dhabi. \u201cThis has become more important because of what happened with the radicalization of groups that have kidnapped Islam\u201d for their own political purposes. \u201cIt is against everything that this country stands for,\u201d he added.Image-conscious government sports officials rushed to apologize formally for the snub and to pose for photographs with the Israeli athletes.Meanwhile, the Emiratis are pressing forward with their higher ambitions \u2014 led by officials often educated in the United States and more likely to speak flawless English than French.In many ways, the government regards its costly cultural strategy to open the Louvre Abu Dhabi and then another long-delayed museum outpost \u2014 the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, designed by Frank Gehry \u2014 as the diplomatic approach of the 15th-century house of Medici that solidified its power, influence and image from Florence, Italy, through the patronage of art and architecture.The ambitious project \u201cwas a bit far-fetched to a lot of people,\u201d said Mohamed Khalifa al-Mubarak, chairman of the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority, and a Northeastern University graduate in economics and political science.Ten years ago the global museum community was united in opposing the notion of \u201crenting\u201d national treasures and risking damage by shipping them afar. But time has worn critics down, along with the general acceptance of the constant travel of art works globally for exhibitions.Museum officials contend that they are ready and that the site has been inspected recently by the French ministry of culture for security and temperature controls.\u201cIt\u2019s completely secure,\u201d said Laurence des Cars, the director of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay and the former curatorial director for the Abu Dhabi project, who is sending the self-portrait by van Gogh and \u201cThe Fifer,\u201d by Manet.The Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, which is lending a jeweled 13th-century box, is funding half of an $8.8 million renovation of its reception area with money from the Louvre Abu Dhabi project. .A small part of the Louvre Abu Dhabi is dedicated to contemporary and modern art. The rest focuses on telling the story of world histories and religions, with an emphasis on mixing works from different places.\u201cWhat is the Louvre Abu Dhabi? It\u2019s a narrative of humankind from the beginning of knowledge, using art as a witness of the times,\u201d said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Charnier, the project\u2019s chief curator and scientific director for Agence France-Museums.\u201cIt does not have an image yet or a brand or a flavor,\u201d he added.A constant question for the new museum is how bold it will be. Ms. des Cars, who as former director of acquisitions had placed the winning bid for the Mondrian painting at an auction, insisted that cultural officials here have taken some \u201cdaring positions dealing with religion and nudity.\u201dMr. Mubarak took pains in an interview to praise the beauty of a newly acquired Yemeni Torah. It will be exhibited with a seventh-century Quran and gothic Bible.\u201cI had to have the content reviewed, but no one said no,\u201d she said, when asked if there were any restrictions. She hopes to create an app for museum visitors to pick their own creation myths to project on the stone walls.Abu Dhabi officials are already preparing for the future. Mr. Mubarak predicted that the Louvre Abu Dhabi will have a domino effect and that the construction contract for the long-planned Guggenheim Abu Dhabi could be awarded next year. (A Guggenheim spokesman declined to comment.)\u201cWe have some egos,\u201d he added, with Gallic understatement. \u201cThat\u2019s a revolution in mentality.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the reason the labor specialist Andrew Ross was traveling to the United Arab Emirates when he barred from entering that country. The New York University professor was planning to do research there, but he did not have a relationship with N.Y.U.\u2019s satellite campus in Abu Dhabi.An earlier version of this article misstated the age of a Quran in the Louvre Abu Dhabi\u2019s collection. It is from the seventh century, not the sixth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Edward Herman, 92, Critic of U.S. Media and Foreign Policy, Dies", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEdward Herman, an economist who joined the linguist Noam Chomsky in accusing the United States of foreign policy hypocrisy and the mass media of complicity in parroting government propaganda, died on Nov. 11 in Penn Valley, Pa., near Philadelphia. He was 92.The cause was complications of bladder cancer, his wife, Christine Abbott, said.Dr. Herman was primarily responsible for the manifesto \u201cManufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media\u201d (1988), which he wrote with Professor Chomsky. It concluded that \u201cmarket forces, internalized assumptions and self-censorship\u201d motivate newspapers and television networks to stifle dissent.Dr. Herman, who was less reticent than Professor Chomsky about challenging the political left as well as more familiar conservative targets, was not immune from criticism himself.\u201cIf we consider mainstream media to be nothing but propagandistic,\u201d said the author Todd Gitlin, a journalism and sociology professor at Columbia University, \u201cwe have no vocabulary left to condemn the likes of Fox News and Breitbart.\u201dStill, the public-affairs scholar Derek N. Shearer wrote in The Los Angeles Times in 1988 that for its case studies alone, \u201cManufacturing Consent\u201d \u201cshould be required reading for future foreign correspondents and foreign editors at leading schools of journalism and public affairs.\u201dOne case study, for example, asked why a single Polish priest murdered by the Communists was more newsworthy than another cleric killed by a Washington-sponsored Latin American dictator.Dr. Herman and Professor Chomsky were severely criticized over the years as soft-pedaling evidence of genocide in Cambodia, Rwanda and, during the Bosnia war, Srebrenica.They argued that in assessing the killings they were seeking an accurate count rather than relying on unreliable reports by survivors. In the civil wars in Rwanda and Bosnia, they said, the victors had exaggerated the toll to justify their rise to power and their pro-Western policies.In the case of Cambodia, they said, the toll had been overstated by enemies of the brutal Khmer Rouge Communist regime, which, the authors wrote, had \u201cdealt with fundamental problems rooted in the feudal past and exacerbated by the imperial system.\u201dAmong their critics was Professor Gitlin, who wrote in an email, \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to their Manichaean view of the world that the suffering of the Cambodians is less important than their need to pin the damage done to Cambodia in the 1970s primarily on the American bombing that preceded the rise of the Khmer Rouge to power \u2014 bombing that was indeed heinous, ruinous, and did contribute to the rise of the Khmer Rouge, but that was only the prologue to the horrendous crimes that followed at the hands of the Khmer Rouge.\u201dFor example, he noted that the authors acknowledged that despite the supposedly omnipotent media propaganda system, \u201can active grass-roots oppositional movement with very limited media access\u201d was pivotal in undermining President Ronald Reagan\u2019s efforts to aid right-wing rebel groups in Nicaragua. But \u201cthe only explanation they offer for this apparent anomaly,\u201d Professor LaFeber added, \u201cis that the \u2018system is not all-powerful.\u2019 \u201dDr. Herman\u2019s articles, interviews, letters and nearly 20 books defied popular convention and animated public debate on a broad range of issues, including corporate power, human rights and wars waged by the United States in Vietnam and Iraq.Thomas Ferguson, a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, said of Dr. Herman\u2019s studies in an email, \u201cSome of these have been very controversial, but whatever you thought of them, many, such as the discussions of Vietnam, helped stimulate a rethinking of the real consequences of policies that many citizens knew very little about.\u201dAnd Professor Chomsky himself wrote, also in an email, of his sometime collaborator\u2019s \u201cscrupulous, diligent and comprehensive research; a keen instinct for detecting and exposing hypocrisy and deceit and the effects of conformity to doctrine; and a recognition of the role of institutional structures in shaping interpretation and analysis.\u201dEdward Samuel Herman was born on April 7, 1925, in Philadelphia to Abraham Lincoln Herman, a pharmacist, and the former Celia Dektor.His wife, the former Mary Woody, died in 2013. In addition to Ms. Abbott, a longtime friend whom he married in 2015, he is survived by a brother, Harris. A sister, Barbara Herman Becker, died this year.Dr. Herman earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in economics at the University of Pennsylvania and a doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley, where he was inspired by the research into fascist economic systems done by Professor Robert A. Brady.He returned to the University of Pennsylvania in 1958 to join the faculty of the Wharton School of Business and taught finance there until he retired in 1989.His other books included \u201cThe Political Economy of Human Rights\u201d (1979), also written with Professor Chomsky; \u201cCorporate Control, Corporate Power: A Twentieth Century Fund Study\u201d (1981); and \u201cThe Global Media\u201d (1997), with Robert McChesney.Dr. Herman\u2019s fierce advocacy contrasted with what colleagues characterized as his gentle and self-effacing demeanor, as seen in his willingness to share credit for his research and writing.\u201cBetter than Chomsky\u2019s \u2018Manufacturing Consent\u2019?\u201d the therapist replies.When the movie was released, Mr. Cohen wondered whether Dr. Herman was upset at being slighted by the script.\u201cI asked Ed if he felt left out,\u201d Mr. Cohen wrote. \u201cNot at all \u2014 the movie \u2018will bring our book more attention, more readers.\u2019 Pure Ed.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to Dr. Herman and Noam Chomsky\u2019s arguments about genocide in Rwanda and, during the Bosnia war, Srebrenica. Those arguments did not appear in their book \u201cManufacturing Consent,\u201d which was published several years before those genocides.Advertisement"}

Using Mr. Powell\u2019s nickname, the president said, \u201cI am confident that with Jay as a wise steward of the Federal Reserve, it will have the leadership it needs in the years to come.\u201dBut he lacks the deep background in economics of some of his predecessors, and he has expressed skepticism in the past about the unconventional measures that the Fed took after the recession.Mr. Powell could also depart from the Fed\u2019s current trajectory when it comes to regulating banks and other financial institutions \u2014 rules Mr. Trump has said should be loosened.The nominee offered little hint of his thinking during brief remarks in the Rose Garden. He said the nation\u2019s economy has made \u201csubstantial progress toward full recovery\u201d since the financial crisis and that banks are in far better shape. \u201cI will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant and prepared to respond to changes in markets and evolving risks,\u201d he said.By most conventional measures, Ms. Yellen\u2019s four years as the nation\u2019s top monetary policymaker have been a success.Mr. Powell is a Republican with strong roots in the party\u2019s establishment and in the financial industry, a lawyer by training and investment banker by trade. As Fed chair, a position some consider the second most powerful post in government, he would be the voice of an institution that is charged with keeping the economy on track by adjusting interest rates that influence the decisions of millions of Americans.Mr. Trump said that he respected Ms. Yellen and on Thursday called her \u201ca wonderful woman who has done a terrific job.\u201d In a statement, Ms. Yellen congratulated her chosen successor and said she was \u201cconfident in his deep commitment to carrying out the vital public mission of the Federal Reserve.\u201dThe Fed under Ms. Yellen\u2019s leadership has sharply reduced unemployment while maintaining control of inflation, coming as close to achieving its congressional mandate as at any time in its history.Her prospects to be renominated momentarily lifted making when the president agreed to meet with her on Oct. 19 at the urging of Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s national economics adviser who himself was once a top candidate.Mr. Trump came away genuinely impressed with Ms. Yellen, according to a person briefed on the process, but a speech she gave in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in favor of financial regulation damaged her chances given the White House agenda of cutting red tape and freeing up financial firms.White House officials said Mr. Trump was impressed with Mr. Powell\u2019s combination of government and private sector experience. Ultimately, Mr. Trump, who as a real estate developer benefited from cheap credit, came down for Mr. Powell, whom he hopes will deliver lower interest rates.The position requires Senate confirmation, but Mr. Powell is likely to attract broad support from the Republican majority. He won some Democratic votes when he was confirmed as a Fed governor in 2012, and when he was confirmed again in 2014.The Federal Reserve has embarked on a path of gradually raising its interest rate from ultralow levels meant to stimulate the economy after the financial crisis. The Fed is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate again in December, likely Ms. Yellen\u2019s final act as chair. Under Mr. Powell\u2019s leadership, the Fed will presumably continue on its projected path of raising its interest rate three more times next year, as well as continuing to pare back its massive balance sheet of Treasury notes and bonds.Mr. Powell remains a centrist voice in the Fed\u2019s internal debates, arguing for the Fed to end its stimulus campaign at a slow and steady pace. Over the last year, that has placed him solidly among the majority led by Ms. Yellen.\u201cOur view is Powell is the G.O.P. version of Yellen, with the added kicker of wanting to reduce regulation,\u201d said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets.But some argue that there is more uncertainty surrounding Mr. Powell\u2019s approach than for other recent Fed chairs. Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities, said it was unclear how aggressive Mr. Powell would be in responding to an economic slowdown.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to think of Powell as a Yellen clone,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cIn terms of the core issues of monetary policy, we just don\u2019t have much of a baseline for him.\u201dMr. Powell would be the first Fed chair in four decades who does not have a degree in economics \u2014 meaning his opinions may not be as fully formed as some of his predecessors. He also lacks a body of academic work analysts could parse for his views.Ms. Yellen\u2019s work on the labor market and former Fed chair Ben Bernanke\u2019s focus on financial crises both gave insight into their leadership at the Fed, said Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University. But beyond Mr. Powell\u2019s performance as a \u201cloyal lieutenant\u201d to Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen, \u201cwe don\u2019t know all that much about any existing priors Powell has about monetary policy,\u201d she said.As a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, Mr. Powell raised concerns in 2013 that the Fed was trying too hard to revive economic growth with its massive bond-buying program \u2014 calling into question whether he would be as willing as Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen to use such tools again.The Fed announced in September 2012 that it would launch a third round of bond buying, purchasing $85 billion a month in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until economic conditions improved to its satisfaction. The program was backed by Mr. Bernanke, then Fed chair, and Ms. Yellen, then the vice chairwoman, who argued the Fed had not done enough to reduce unemployment.A group of three Fed governors, including Mr. Powell, pressed Mr. Bernanke to clarify the Fed\u2019s goals, establishing what Mr. Powell called an \u201coff-ramp\u201d for the program.\u201cThere are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThere are some ideas that I would not support.\u201dMr. Powell has expressed support for legislation that would require financial regulators to apply cost-benefit analysis to proposed rules. He pushed back against proposals to allow large banks to borrow more of their funding, saying that requiring them to raise capital from investors had strengthened the financial system.Mr. Powell, 64, is a Washington native. He studied politics at Princeton, then earned a law degree from Georgetown and embarked on a career in investment banking.In 1990, he returned to Washington to work for Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and was named under secretary for finance. When Salomon Brothers was caught trying to manipulate the market in Treasuries, Mr. Powell spent an August weekend making phone calls from Cape Cod, arranging for the company\u2019s top managers to resign and for Warren Buffett, a major investor, to become chairman of the company\u2019s board.Mr. Powell joined the private equity firm Carlyle Group in 1997. Over the next eight years, he solidified his fortune. His 2016 financial disclosure form showed a net worth of as much as $55 million. In 2005, he left the firm to focus on public policy as a scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center.He attracted the attention of the Obama administration in 2011, when he worked behind the scenes to persuade congressional Republicans to raise the debt ceiling. The next year, President Barack Obama nominated Mr. Powell to the Fed.Kate Kelly and Ben Casselman contributed reporting from New York, and Peter Baker from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It Started as a Tax Cut. Now It Could Change American Life.", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisSome of this re-engineering is straight out of the traditional Republican playbook. Corporate taxes, along with those on wealthy Americans, would be slashed on the presumption that when people in penthouses get relief, the benefits flow down to basement tenements.All of this is taking shape at such extraordinary velocity, absent the usual analyses and hearings, that even the most savvy Washington lobbyist cannot be fully certain of the implications.Mr. Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress \u2014 stymied in their efforts to repeal Obamacare, and short of legislative achievements \u2014 have signaled absolute resolve to get a tax bill passed by the end of the year. As the sense has taken hold that Washington is now a trading floor where any deal is worth entertaining so long as it brings votes, interest groups have fixed on the tax bill as a unique opportunity to further their agendas.\u201cPeople want to add certain things, and if they don\u2019t cost a lot, it\u2019s a way to buy in agreement,\u201d Mr. Steuerle said.It\u2019s virtually impossible to fully understand, let alone keep up with, the flood of proposals, amendments and analyses that continue to pour out. Here are some of the big-picture ideas to keep in mind as this political sausage is being made.\u201cWhen you put all these pieces together, what you\u2019re left with is we are squandering a giant sum of money,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a former chief of staff at the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation who teaches law at the University of Southern California. \u201cIt\u2019s not aimed at growth. It is not aimed at the middle class. It is at every turn carefully engineered to deliver a kiss to the donor class.\u201dIf the package does have a guiding philosophy, it is a return to trickle-down economics, an enduring story line in which the wealthy are supposed to spend and invest their tax breaks, creating jobs and commercial opportunities for everyone else.As President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes in the 1980s, he argued that citizens, not bureaucrats, should decide how to spend their money. President George W. Bush bestowed enormous tax cuts on the affluent.Nonetheless, Republicans are staging a trickle-down revival.\u201cEither it\u2019s a religious belief, a belief where no amount of evidence would change that, or they are using the argument cynically and they just want more money for themselves,\u201d the economist Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate, said.Mr. Stiglitz has long warned of the perils of growing inequality while deriding tax-cutting inclinations. Yet even those who have favored lighter tax burdens are critical of the current proposals.In the late 1970s, Bruce Bartlett developed what would become the locus of the Reagan tax cuts while working for Representative Jack Kemp, a conservative Republican from New York. Those cuts helped cushion the pain from sharp increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bartlett maintains. But Reagan was lowering the highest tax rate on individuals from 70 percent down to 28 percent by 1986.\u201cWhat they have here is a big tax cut for the rich paid for with random increases in taxes for various constituencies,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. And it\u2019s telling that they are ramming this through without any debate. All of the empirical evidence goes against the tax cut.\u201dThe meat of the package is a permanent lowering of the corporate tax rate, to 20 percent from 35 percent, which business leaders have long wanted. Proponents assert that this would prompt multinational companies to expand operations in the United States.\u201cWe\u2019ve been bleeding corporate headquarters and production for a long time,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit that promotes smaller government.In 2004, Congress invited American corporations to bring home overseas earnings at a sharply reduced rate, pitching it as a means of bolstering investment. But the corporations spent as much as 90 percent of their windfall buying back their shares, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis research.If Congress bestows fresh relief on major businesses, signs suggest a similar result. Many companies are enjoying record profits. Those in the Fortune 500 had $2.6 trillion salted away overseas as of last year.\u201cIn our boardroom, the number-one thing we\u2019re talking about is not taxes,\u201d said Jeremy Stoppelman, chief executive of Yelp, the online review platform. \u201cHaving a strong middle class out there spending money is what\u2019s most important for our business.\u201dIf the tax bill widens inequality, local communities will likely find themselves with fewer resources to aim at helping struggling people.In high-tax states like California, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut \u2014 where electorates have historically shown a willingness to finance ample safety-net programs \u2014 the measure could change the political calculus. It would magnify the costs to taxpayers, pressuring states to stay lean or risk the wrath of voters.Some see in this tilt a reworking of basic principles that have prevailed in American life for generations.The Senate tax bill has been marketed by Republicans as a tax cut for the middle class. How would people in your income group fare?Since the 1930s, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt created Social Security, unemployment benefits and other pillars of the safety net to combat the Great Depression, crises have been tempered by some measure of government support. Recent decades have brought cuts to social services, but the impact of the current bill could be especially consequential.\u201cThis tax bill is a grand deception,\u201d said Arnold Hiatt, the former chief executive of Stride Rite, which makes children\u2019s shoes. \u201cIt hurts the most vulnerable, and hurts health care and education, which are essential for a healthy economy.\u201dThe proposals break from seven decades\u2019 worth of federal efforts to broaden access to higher education.The House bill includes provisions that would end the deductibility of tuition waivers for graduate students and repeal the deduction for interest paid on student loans. Both chambers\u2019 bills would tax investment earnings from university endowments.The endowment tax, in particular, threatens the ability of low-income students to pursue college and graduate studies, said Ron Haskins, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Proceeds from endowments subsidize students from lower-income families, while allowing students across the board to graduate with less debt.\u201cIt\u2019s very far-reaching,\u201d he added, \u201cbut there hasn\u2019t been much of a debate.\u201dDavid Gelles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Tax Proposals Threaten Lower-Income Housing", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Conor Dougherty, a reporter based in the Bay Area.Among the many threatened tax breaks are provisions that fund affordable housing. The details vary between House and Senate versions of the bill, but the final result \u2014 assuming tax reform is passed and signed by President Trump \u2014 is quite likely to make affordable rental housing harder to build and finance.That would affect every state, of course, but a slowdown in affordable housing construction would be particularly brutal for California, which has a huge homeless problem and a $500,000 median home price that is more than twice the national level.\u201cAffordable housing\u201d is a frequently misunderstood term. While many people use it as shorthand for anything that seems affordable on a typical salary in their area, it refers to subsidized units that are set aside for a city\u2019s lower-income residents. Beyond cheap rent, these developments offer things like flu shots, job training and discounted internet that keep people employable and help them move up in the work force.To build these units, nonprofit developers use a mix of bonds and tax credits that offset the cost of construction and allow them to offer lower rents for tenants. A little more than half of subsidized developments are financed with tax-free private activity bonds. They also get money from tax credits that developers transfer to corporations, which then use the credits to lower their taxes.The Senate version of the tax bill is less extreme: It leaves private activity bonds intact but reduces the value of low-income tax credits.\u201cThe House bill would drastically reduce the future supply of affordable housing, whereas the Senate bill would only damage it,\u201d said Michael Novogradac, managing partner of Novogradac & Company.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)La Ni\u00f1a is back, but not with a vengeance.This year\u2019s version of La Ni\u00f1a was called \u201cweak\u201d by the Weather Service, which estimates it will continue until between February and April.

{"Headline": "Jona Rechnitz Takes Center Stage in Corruption Trial", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring opening statements in the federal corruption trial against Norman Seabrook, the former head of the city\u2019s correction officers\u2019 union, a prosecutor warned jurors that the government\u2019s key witness, Jona S. Rechnitz, would be a criminal, an entitled real estate scion, a \u201cwheeler and dealer\u201d and a \u201cwannabe big shot.\u201d\u201cBut the question isn\u2019t going to be whether you approve of Jona Rechnitz, or even whether you like him,\u201d the prosecutor, Martin Bell, said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be whether you believe he\u2019s telling the truth.\u201dPerhaps even Mr. Bell could not foresee just how difficult that question would turn out to be. Over the course of his six days on the witness stand in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Rechnitz, who is cooperating with the government after pleading guilty to fraud conspiracy, was accused of racism, self-importance and above all, lying: to family, to friends, to potential investors, to government investigators \u2014 and to the jury.Mr. Rechnitz had been called to testify about how he facilitated a payoff between Mr. Seabrook and the financier Murray Huberfeld, who is accused of bribing Mr. Seabrook into steering millions of dollars of correction officers\u2019 retirement money into his hedge fund. But ultimately, Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s testimony revealed far less about Mr. Seabrook\u2019s possible crime than it did about Mr. Rechnitz himself, whose name has often been mentioned with, but overshadowed by, the names of the powerful figures with whom he is accused of trying to buy influence, including Mayor Bill de Blasio and the former New York Police Department chief Philip Banks III.And his testimony further elucidated the various corruption inquiries in which Mr. Rechnitz, the son of a Los Angeles real estate millionaire, has been entangled.He summed up his swaggering approach to buying power and influence in a 2014 email to a friend: \u201cI play the game well,\u201d he wrote.\u201cIs your testimony that what you said on Friday is the same thing you said today?\u201d Paul Shechtman, Mr. Seabrook\u2019s lawyer, said.\u201cYeah,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said.Also on Thursday, Mr. Rechnitz told prosecutors that he remembered telling F.B.I. agents that he had paid a bribe to Mr. Seabrook in the early afternoon of Dec. 11, 2014, despite telling defense lawyers earlier that he did not recall the time of day.Through it all, Mr. Rechnitz made no attempts to win the sympathy of the jury. He admitted asking his father-in-law to lie to investigators for him, falsely telling a potential investor that he was his best friend and lying to his wife about a private flight to Las Vegas with police officers and a prostitute aboard. His face showed little emotion, even as he professed great remorse and deep shame for his actions.Other times, he was by turns sullen or combative, self-pitying or defiant. He often tangled with defense lawyers over nuances of wording and other technicalities, or claimed faulty memory or ignorance as reasons he could not answer a question. Several times, jurors appeared visibly irritated or skeptical.Perhaps Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s least credible moment came on his final day of testimony, when Mr. Shechtman asked Mr. Rechnitz about the time he painted his face black to attend a celebration for Purim, a Jewish holiday where people often wear costumes.\u201cYou went to Purim one year dressed up in blackface?\u201d Mr. Shechtman asked. Mr. Seabrook, his client, is black.\u201cWhat is blackface?\u201d Mr. Rechnitz responded. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what blackface is.\u201dMr. Shechtman continued to press Mr. Rechnitz, who maintained that he did not know what blackface was or that it was derogatory to African-Americans, even as he admitted pairing the costume in 2013 with a gold chain and false gold teeth.Henry Mazurek, a lawyer for Mr. Huberfeld, was equally incredulous, asking Mr. Rechnitz about growing up in Los Angeles during the Rodney King riots, or his involvement with the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the human rights organization that runs the Museum of Tolerance, which Mr. Rechnitz acknowledged had an exhibit on the African-American civil rights movement.Mr. Bell, the prosecutor, tried to mitigate the damage by asking Mr. Rechnitz if he had known many black people growing up, or if he had studied African-American history while attending Jewish Orthodox private schools.But even Mr. Bell\u2019s questions showed the extent of ignorance to which Mr. Rechnitz would have to plead to show a lack of knowledge of blackface.\u201cWhen is the last time you read a book, Mr. Rechnitz?\u201d Mr. Bell, who is black, asked.\u201cThis is embarrassing,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz responded. \u201cI think I\u2019ve only read one or two books in my life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Congress Weighs Repeal of Tax Credit for Rare Disease Drugs", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA decades-old tax credit designed to spur cures for rare diseases has been so successful that it\u2019s now become a target in the House Republican tax plan.The proposal under consideration would end the tax breaks for development of what are called orphan drugs. Ending the credit used by big and small drug companies could save the government an estimated $54 billion over the next decade, an effort to help offset some of the anticipated losses in revenue if other Republican tax cut provisions become law.With the Senate poised to offer its own broad tax plan soon, many details are still in flux. But if the orphan drug tax credit is eliminated, the move would represent a rare defeat for the powerful pharmaceutical industry.The tax credit is part of the popular 1983 Orphan Drug Act, and is one of a host of incentives that supporters say have led to the approval of more than 500 new and much-needed drugs for those rare diseases that each affect fewer than 200,000 people. But the program has also come under scrutiny because critics say that some major drugmakers have exploited it by obtaining the orphan designation for billion-dollar blockbuster drugs like Humira for treating rheumatoid arthritis and Crestor, the cholesterol drug, that were already on the market.Even if the proposal passes the House, it will likely face opposition in the Senate, particularly from Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, who is overseeing tax reform in the Senate and was a leading sponsor of the Orphan Drug Act.No matter what happens, some experts welcomed a discussion about a political issue that was once considered untouchable because opponents risked being labeled coldhearted toward people with serious medical conditions.\u201cI think it opens up the debate on the orphan drug tax credit, which we think is a flawed incentive,\u201d said James Love, director of the consumers group Knowledge Ecology International. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a positive thing.\u201dUnder current law, companies that develop drugs for rare diseases can receive a tax credit for half of the cost of their clinical trials and they are also granted seven years of exclusivity, when the drug is protected from competition. Companies are not required to disclose the amounts of the tax credits they receive.Big drugmakers in particular stand to benefit more from the proposed lower corporate tax rate than from the loss of a tax credit that some companies do not use. And like other major corporations, the industry\u2019s opposition may be coalescing far more against a proposed excise tax that could penalize companies for manufacturing their products overseas. These days, many drugs are made outside the United States.The bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.Companies that make drugs to treat rare diseases and their lobbyists are already marshaling forces to retain the tax credit. Tactics include enlisting patient-advocacy groups \u2014 many financed by drug companies \u2014 and members, whose life-threatening and debilitating diseases often have more of a compelling effect than pharmaceutical executives on lawmakers and the public.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any prior warning,\u201d said Paul Melmeyer, federal policy director for the National Organization for Rare Disorders, or NORD. \u201cWe look at that just utter lack of therapies for our patient populations. There could be even 33 percent fewer than what we have, going forward, and that is really what our concern is.\u201dOver the last decade, the number of new drugs to treat rare diseases has proliferated, in part because of advancements in scientific research and in part because drug companies have found new ways to profit from diseases that were once seen as unworthy of corporate investment. In 2016, nine of the 22 new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration were for rare diseases; in 2015, 21 of the 45 drugs approved fell into that category.Despite the investment, advocates note that of the 7,000 rare diseases that have been identified, only about 5 percent have an approved therapy. About 30 million Americans have a rare disease, or about a tenth of the population.\u201cWe\u2019re very much counting on him to step up and be the champion on this,\u201d Mr. Melmeyer said.Philip English, a former Republican Congressman who now lobbies for drug firms, said he believed that his clients were picking up support from Republicans and said he was confident that the tax credit would survive any Senate plan.\u201cI think there is a consensus within the industry and within the advocacy community that the orphan drug credit has been immensely successful in generating innovative investment that has produced a string of successes,\u201d Mr. English said.\u201cWhat seem like small changes can really have a large impact,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately this could end up doing more harm than good, and that really would be a problem for the millions of people who are relying on these companies to develop new therapies.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the relationship between the National Organization for Rare Disorders and Philip English, a former Republican Congressman and now a lobbyist representing drug companies. Mr. English did not lobby on behalf of the organization.Advertisement"}

This is what the sales factor apportionment system, already in use by most US states, does. Corporations earn income from sales. Therefore income should be allocated based upon the destination of those sales. MNC income should no longer be allocated based upon the location of a subsidiary that allegedly earned it. The location of sales is much more difficult to manipulate than the \u201corigin of income\u201d under the current system.\u201cThe US tax base for corporations would be calculated on the basis of a fraction of companies\u2019 worldwide income. This fraction would be the share of each company\u2019s worldwide sales that are destined for customers in the United States. The taxpayer, under SFA, is the whole unitary business, including all evasion-motivated subsidiaries over which the parent corporations exercise legal and economic control.\u201d\u201cIn effect, firms should be taxed on their access to a specific consumer market - from which they generate revenue - rather than on their cleverness at artificially allocating expenses and revenue in tax havens in which their subsidiaries \u2018incorporate.\u2019\u201d\u201cI think Aspen\u2019s work is needed more than ever. We have to have a table that people can gather around, to share perspectives and ideas and to translate those ideas into action. It really matters that we commit ourselves to evidence-based argumentation, to respecting what has been established through science, building upon past knowledge. Part of what\u2019s made this country great is a commitment to being reality based and to being factually grounded. Public policy has grown out of so much serious research.\u201dThe Royal Bank of Scotland told staff on Thursday that it was formally closing its internal bad bank, an important milestone as Chief Executive Ross McEwan works to turn around the British bank.Since the division was started in 2008, the bank, based in Edinburgh, has exited 22 countries, cut its risk-weighted assets by more than half and shrunk its assets to 752 billion, or about $1 trillion. The bank held as much as \u00a32.2 trillion in assets.Closing the Capital Resolution unit is an important moment, but the bank\u2019s turnaround is far from finished.R.B.S. has not reported an annual profit in nine years. It is not expected to report an annual profit until 2018 despite reporting a profit in the first half of this year.The bank passed a stress test by the Bank of England this year that measured the ability of lenders to weather another financial crisis, but remained among the weakest of the biggest British banks. (It was forced to bolster its capital last year after failing the regulatory test.)R.B.S. also remains 72 percent owned by the British government following a bailout during the financial crisis. The government said this month that it plans to resume sales of its holdings by 2019 and hopes to sell some \u00a315 billion of its stake by 2022.That process will be helped if R.B.S. can continue to improve its profitability and its capital position. A return to paying a dividend next year also would be a welcome sign for shareholders.From the WSJ:\u201cBelieve me, I didn\u2019t have this much fun with T. Rowe Price, \u201d said the retired secretary and taxi driver Ms. Scott, referring to her mutual-fund investments.Steven Mnuchin and other White House officials have argued that the Republican tax overhaul plans would pay for themselves through higher economic growth. And there were studies to prove that, even as critics say that tax cuts wouldn\u2019t have such an effect.An economist at the Office of Tax Analysis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize his job, said Treasury had not released a \u201cdynamic\u201d analysis showing that the tax plan would be paid for with economic growth because one did not exist.Instead, Treasury staffers have done smaller analyses of individual provisions.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedStarting with putting his 65,000-acre Mesa Vista Ranch in Texas up for sale, with a price tag of $250 million.Slowly but inevitably, my fading vision and limited hearing have forced me to give up things I\u2019ve loved and excelled at \u2014 golf and hunting, in particular. Although the beauty of Mesa Vista remains intact, the ranch roads I have driven thousands of times are now blurred. It\u2019s time to embrace and accept that my life has changed.It\u2019s acknowledgment by the 89-year-old Mr. Pickens that he is in his twilight years, after having built a fortune as an oil magnate and then a financier who rose to fame during the corporate raider period of the 1980s.In selling the Mesa Vista Ranch, the mogul said that he wants to make sure that it ends up with a buyer who will carry on his conservation efforts.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe firing of Matt Lauer from NBC News for \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace\u201d marks one of the highest-profile dismissals yet in business for misconduct and abuse. It also highlights the potential financial impact of those violations.Much of Mr. Lauer\u2019s power stemmed from the bond he had forged with viewers as the longest tenured host in the program\u2019s 65 years. The first two hours of \u201cToday\u201d \u2014 Mr. Lauer\u2019s showcase \u2014 generated $508 million in revenue last year, more than the amount brought in by the other network morning shows, according to Kantar Media.And while \u201cToday\u201d trails ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in total viewers, it still leads in the coveted 25-to-54 advertising demographic.The bigger pictureAt the end of the day, any company is better off \u2014 and I do mean financially better off \u2014 without someone who uses their power for inappropriate sexual behavior that makes the workplace a threatening place for colleagues and stymies women\u2019s ability to climb the ranks.A senior financial executive phoned Michael last night to complain about how the Senate tax plan would endanger the private equity industry because it limits the deductibility of corporate debt interest payments \u2014 and applies that even to existing investments. The provision could completely upend the private equity business model, this person asserted.Dell took on about $50 billion in debt for its merger with EMC Corp. At a roughly 5 percent interest rate, that means the company has about $2 billion in annual interest payments. The House and Senate bills would remove at least half those deductions, Mr. Vallone said in an interview Wednesday. At a 20 percent tax rate, that\u2019s a $200 million hit each year.The state of playThe Senate could vote as soon as tomorrow on its tax plan. But there are plenty of unresolved matters:While the 3.7 percent drop in an index tracking Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google was the biggest in 21 months, the amount of lost money exceeded any other single day on record. At about $60 billion, the decline in their combined market value is poised to eclipse any since Facebook arrived in public markets.What\u2019s behind the drop?
