This ultimately results in higher prices and lower quality service for consumers.\u201dAT&T/DirecTV executives have concluded that the \u201crunway\u201d for the decline of traditional payTV \u201cmay be longer than some think given the economics of the space,\u201d and that it is \u201cupon us to utilize our assets to extend that runway.\u201dAT&T itself has previously stated that access to some of the most popular television programming is \u201ccritical to preserve and promote competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming.\u201d\u201cAfter reviewing DOJ\u2019s lawsuit against AT&T-Time Warner and watching AT&T\u2019s press conference, we still see a settlement as possible and, failing that, we believe AT&T would prevail in court.\u201d\u201cUnder my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,\u201d F.C.C. chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that\u2019s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate.\u201dThe move is a win for the giant telecoms like AT&T and Verizon as well as the big cable providers such as Comcast.\u201cThe losers could be internet sites that will have to answer telecom firms to get their content in front of consumers. And consumers may see their bills increase for the best quality of internet service.\u201dAndrew worked the phones yesterday and hears:Media executives at the other big content and distribution providers privately tell me that they hope AT&T and Time Warner do not find a way to settle.

Now the F.C.C. under Chairman Ajit Pai is poised to roll those initiatives back.Mr. Pai plans to accompany the repeal of net neutrality with several other measures that will also benefit broadband companies, said the people with knowledge of the matter. That includes suggesting that the Federal Trade Commission, which has traditionally not brought many cases, be the enforcement agency of net neutrality violations, they said.\u201cIt\u2019s not completely irrational to say the tax code is a disaster,\u201d Mr. Rattner said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here is that the importance of reforming the tax code trumps, excuse the pun, fixing the debt.\u201dBut Pete Peterson, the Blackstone co-founder and perhaps the most outspoken billionaire on the issue of the federal deficit, is having none of it. He told Andrew:\u201cMortgaging our fiscal future for trillions in temporary tax cuts will hurt our economy over time, and every C.E.O. should know that,\u201d he said. \u201cTrue business patriots need to advocate for their country as well as their company.\u201dThe European Union has already decided to move top regulatory agencies outside of London: The European Medicines Agency will leave London for Amsterdam, while the European Banking Authority will relocate to Paris.Its deal to buy as many as 24,000 self-driving Volvo vehicles reflects the ride-hailing giant\u2019s broad ambitions to make autonomous driving part of its future.\u201cThe only way we could control our own destiny was to work with this technology that had the potential to disrupt our business, and have direct involvement in the creation of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Hence, why Anheuser-Busch is replacing the head of its United States subsidiary.The management changes mark a new phase for the company\u2019s U.S. operations, said Carlos Brito, chief executive of the Belgium-based behemoth. The first phase, after InBev\u2019s 2008 takeover of Anheuser-Busch, was aimed at cutting costs and paying off debt. The second focused on expanding the portfolio with craft beers and growing higher-end brands such as Stella Artois and Michelob Ultra, Mr. Brito said.Shares in the conglomerate closed down about 7.2 percent Monday, to $19.02.\u201cPerhaps the most encouraging development to be found in Mr. Flannery\u2019s 57-page slide show on Monday is a plan to put just 12 directors up for a vote next year, including three new ones.

And it signaled last week that it wanted to expand its presence in the developing world, where Facebook is dominant. Only about 25 percent of Snapchat\u2019s daily active users live outside North America and Europe, compared with more than 65 percent of Facebook\u2019s users.Instagram Stories, a near-clone of Snapchat\u2019s most distinctive feature, has reached 300 million daily active users, nearly twice as many as Snapchat. Facebook\u2019s enormous profits have given lofty expectations to investors in other social media companies, and its more than two billion users have made everything else seem small by comparison.But Snap\u2019s pivot is more than a necessary business move. It\u2019s an indictment of our current tech landscape, and a warning sign for other start-ups hoping to take on the largest internet companies on their own terms. If a wildly creative company with an app used by 178 million people every day can still be crushed by Facebook, how is anyone supposed to succeed?Still, the fact that Snap\u2019s future is uncertain should worry you, even if you\u2019ve never used its products. A world in which every successful internet platform is expected to behave like Facebook is a more boring, less innovative world, with no companies to challenge Facebook\u2019s vision of the future. It\u2019s not a good sign that in order to survive as a competitor, Snap may have to abandon the qualities that made it different in the first place.Snapchat\u2019s distinctive qualities also helped steer it clear of some problems that are now plaguing its rivals.\u201cA social network acts against users\u2019 interests when it needs to make money,\u201d he said.Snapchat, Mr. Gallagher writes, was never supposed to be just a photo-sharing app. It was the embodiment of Mr. Spiegel\u2019s worldview about how the internet should work \u2014 temporary instead of permanent, private instead of public, candid instead of rehearsed. I asked Mr. Gallagher why Snap needed to compromise its values in pursuit of Facebook-style growth. Couldn\u2019t it reject Wall Street\u2019s demands, concentrate on making its existing users happy and be satisfied as a smaller and more focused company?\u201cHe has grand, sweeping visions of the future,\u201d Mr. Gallagher said. \u201cIt would be very hard for him to eat a slice of humble pie and say: \u2018We\u2019re not going to be Facebook.

In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.\u201dThe world\u2019s largest banks have become better capitalized since financial crisis. They have raised more than $1.5 trillion in capital, according to the Financial Stability Board. That provides the banks with \u201cbuffers as much as 10x higher than a decade,\u201d writes S&P Global.But these financial instutions have also gotten much larger since the financial crisis.In the United States, for example, JPMorgan Chase has nearly doubled in size since the end of 2006. Bank of America has increased its asset by more than 50 percent, and Wells Fargo\u2019s assets are up more than 300 percent from their pre-crisis levels, according to S&P Global.Much of those increases are a result of deals struck during the heights of the crisis. JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual; Bank of America acquired CountryWide and Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo purchased Wachovia.Still the size of these banks is noteworthy. The \u2018too big to fail\u2019 distinction has drawn scrutiny from the Trump administration this year. A report from the Treasury Department last month \u201cdiscussed the need to eliminate regulation \u2018that fosters the creation or cements the market position of too-big-to-fail institutions\u2019 in order to prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts.\u201dA surprising percentage of respondents to DataTrek Research\u2019s bitcoin/cryptocurrency survey don\u2019t think so.\u2022 Just 39.4 percent of respondents said they believe bitcoin was in a bubble. \u201cWe were ready to see +70% responses indicating bitcoin\u2019s price is unsustainable. Less than 40% is, well, remarkable,\u201d writes DataTrek\u2019s co-founder Nicholas Colas.\u2022 Slightly more than 27 percent expect bitcoin to rise but at much slower pace. Just 16% think the value of bitcoin will double in the next six months.\u2022 \u201cA sizeable minority of respondents (39 \u2013 40 percent) see bitcoin as a potential analog to physical gold, both as a safe haven and a hedge against mistakes in central bank monetary policy,\u201d Mr. Colas writrs. Nearly 41 percent consider bitcoin a safe haven similar to gold, and 39 percent view bitcoin as a hedge against monetary policy.Would the Republican from Maine end up working to defeat the Senate\u2019s tax overhaul, as she did with attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act? Or would she simply lobby for changes to make it more acceptable?\u2022 \u201cIt is a simple but true concept, customers drive business growth, not tax rates, not mythical \u2018job creators.\u2019 Tax rates impact profitability, but are only very indirectly tied to hiring.\u201d\u2022 \u201cLabor markets determine salaries, not tax rates.\u201d\u2022 \u201cAs a C.E.O. and member of the board of directors at a public company, I can tell you that if we had an increase in profitability we would have been delighted but it would not lead in and of itself to more hiring or an increase in wages.\u201dThe euro has recovered from its initial decline after the news that Germans might have to go to the polls. But that hasn\u2019t eased the anxiousness of some market commentators.\u201cAngela Merkel\u2019s position seems to be significantly weakened. This could leave Europe\u2019s largest economy politically paralyzed for the time being, reducing the chances for any breakthrough in the E.U. reform agenda or the Brexit negotiations.\u201d\u201cEven if there are re-elections, that is very unlikely to be populist. That\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be a limited down reaction.\u201dAfter the financial crisis, the federal government was expected to aggressively pursue criminal cases against top financiers. Prosecutions were rare, except with obscure, or relatively junior, industry players against whom it was easy to build cases, because prosecutors were under pressure to move quickly and win cases.Philip Baker became one of those targets.He was not a big fish. But the desire to resolve the case swiftly led a powerful United States attorney to insert a transfer-to-Canada clause into an otherwise airtight plea agreement.In 2011, the government allowed Comcast to absorb NBCUniversal in another \u201charmless\u201d vertical merger (a deal that I opposed). Afterwards, Comcast was caught discriminating against rival cable channels and slowing down rival online video services. All the while, America tumbled down global broadband rankings.

Jackson, AutoNation\u2019s chief executive. In most cases, driverless vehicles in such fleets will have to be on the road almost around the clock to offset the cost of the sensors, computer chips, software and other systems that allow them to drive safely and reach their destinations without human operators, he said.\u201cThese vehicles need to be in service for hundreds of thousands of miles, much more than personal-use vehicles, to make them economically viable,\u201d he said. \u201cTo do that, you have to do much more proactive, preventative maintenance than what a normal person would do on a car.\u201dBecause the vehicles are intended to operate without drivers, breakdowns have to be avoided and parts replaced when signs of wear first appear, not when they fail or when a warning light comes on, Mr. Jackson added. \u201cThey need to work not 99 percent of the time, but 100 percent of the time.\u201dAutoNation said it had already started servicing Waymo vehicles in California and Arizona.With 361 new-car franchises in 16 states, AutoNation has the reach to continue providing service as Waymo builds up fleets in other markets, Mr. Jackson said.Advertisement"}

What I have is a really peculiar timeline.\u201dI\u2019m on the line with Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive. I\u2019ve heard other C.E.O.s offer up brutal judgments of this and previous administrations \u2014 invariably in off-the-record interviews. This one\u2019s on the record.Stephenson is battling the Justice Department, which this week sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner. The suit marks the first time in nearly 40 years that Justice has tried to quash such a deal, known as a vertical merger. The Obama administration approved a similar merger \u2014 one that brings together companies that don\u2019t compete and that offer different products and services \u2014 between Comcast and NBC Universal in 2011.That was before he got his current job. Once he did, Stephenson says, \u201cTemperatures change rather quickly, and Delrahim\u2019s own attitude changes rather quickly.\u201dIn other words, either Delrahim has miraculously seen the liberal light when it comes to vertical mergers, or he\u2019s channeling the wishes, implied or explicit, of the \u201cvery frustrated\u201d man who has made his feelings about the merger well known and could yet make him Sessions\u2019s successor.The government claims that the merged company could jack up prices on other distributors for must-watch content like H.B.O.\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d and that it would also \u201cslow the industry\u2019s transition to new and exciting video distribution models.\u201d But the arguments, Stephenson notes, are \u201cbizarre at best.\u201d\u201cOne has to assume two things,\u201d he says of the idea that the merger will lead to higher prices for consumers. \u201cThat [Time Warner subsidiary] Turner has market power, and that [AT&T subsidiary] DirecTV has market power.\u201d But with roughly 10 percent and 20 percent of their respective markets, they don\u2019t. As for the industry\u2019s \u201ctransition,\u201d has the government not heard of Amazon Prime?In the meantime, companies like Google and Facebook are gobbling up digital advertising dollars. \u201cHow do we compete with these guys?\u201d Stephenson wonders. \u201cIf we can\u2019t take someone with less than 10 percent of viewership and pair it with distribution, what can we do?\u201dThat\u2019s the economic question. Then there\u2019s the political one. Donald Trump makes no secret of his feelings about CNN, a Turner subsidiary. On Tuesday he reiterated his view that the merger was \u201cnot a good deal for the country.\u201dBut the circumstantial case that the Justice Department\u2019s decision is politically motivated is compelling. For conservatives, it\u2019s a fresh reminder that the administration\u2019s pro-business convictions go only as far as the president\u2019s convenience. A Sanders presidency would also have opposed the merger, though at least it would have done so honestly. What we have instead is economic policy conducted as an extension of presidential pique.As for liberals, those inclined to agree with Justice\u2019s decision should note how similar it is to the administration\u2019s curious outreach to Russia. The curiosity isn\u2019t that there is no rational argument for improving relations with Moscow or opposing the merger. It\u2019s that the argument is being made by an administration whose ideological instincts otherwise lean in the opposite direction.I ask Stephenson if the government\u2019s suit smacks of the kind of political risk multinational companies often face in autocratic countries such as Russia or Turkey, where the whims of the ruler have a way of translating into the judgment of regulators and courts.\u201cI don\u2019t know if there has been political interference, but it\u2019s logical to ask questions,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be na\u00efve not to.\u201dGail Collins is off today.Advertisement"}

But one Berlin-based design studio that has worked with brands from Prabal Gurung to Alexander McQueen thinks it can change all that.\u201cWe recognized that many luxury players were still reluctant to get into the 3-D printing market because they just didn\u2019t think the materials and production were of a good enough quality yet,\u201d Mr. Hartung said, adding that VOJD creates its own materials and does all finishing of products.The idea behind the business, he said, was to show that traditional craftsmanship and future technologies are able to work together: After the initial printing process, products are completed manually at a factory in southwestern Germany, much like any luxury-goods workshop.\u201cThe long-term benefits for brands \u2014 particularly when it comes to cost savings and production speed, the lack of need for mold making and the ability to customize pieces \u2014 are all very significant,\u201d Mr. Hartung added. \u201cAnd once we were able to show the types of product that we could create would be impossible using traditional manufacturing processes, more and more companies have started to listen to what we have to offer.\u201dNow, VOJD has 15 employees in Berlin who specialize in the research and development of 3-D printed accessories and jewelry for the top tier of the global fashion and luxury market. For Carolina Herrera, for example, they created bracelets, necklaces and brooches in the shape of jasmine flowers for the fall 2016 collection. With Loewe, as part of the brand\u2019s fall 2017 men\u2019s wear line, a new type of ceramic material was used to print chain bracelets that were single interlocking pieces and didn\u2019t require assembly.And for Akris, VOJD collaborated on a line of lightweight, architectural 3-D printed rings in silver and polyamide (it rarely works with metals). The intricate pieces, shown at the Akris spring 2016 show in Paris, were inspired by the Naoshima Pavilion in Japan, a geometric meshlike steel structure by the architect Sou Fujimoto.Albert Kriemler, creative director Akris, a Swiss fashion house, said, \u201cI am always thinking about how to bring new methods of creation into our studio, but when VOJD approached us in 2015 I was fascinated by what they thought was possible.\u201d\u201cOnce the rings were completed, and in a range of colors, I was even more impressed,\u201d he said, calling the project something that \u201cexpanded the imagination.\u201d The rings were sold in Akris boutiques for $245 each.Mr. Kriemler said no further collaborations were planned but added that he continuedto be excited about 3-D printing and incorporating it into the Akris design process.Of course, the higher the prices, the higher the product standard needs to be, putting constant pressure both on brands and their manufacturing partners to innovate.Mr. Hartung said that a signature of VOJD work was intricate geometries and interlocking elements impossible to replicate elsewhere.\u201cMany of the brands we work with have long had projects or concepts because of them being impossible, too difficult or expensive to realize traditionally,\u201d he said, noting that the cost of an average 3-D printed object had fallen roughly 10 percent a year since 2013.So, for example, a piece could be printed now for 52 euros ($60) that would have cost \u20ac80 in 2013, allowing the savings to be spent on improving aspects like finishing and coloring.And Mr. Hartung said his long-term aim was to create manufacturing programs that can be licensed to brands so they can use the technology themselves.\u201cThree-D printing is revolutionizing processes in many industries outside the world of fashion,\u201d said Mr. Kriemler of Akris. \u201cTraditionally, this has a been a sector resistant to embrace change. But I think it is inevitable that once the technology is of the right standard, luxury will be next.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Way for Machines to See, Taking Shape in Toronto", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 In 2012, Geoffrey Hinton changed the way machines see the world.Along with two graduate students at the University of Toronto, Mr. Hinton, a professor there, built a system that could analyze thousands of photos and teach itself to identify common objects like flowers and cars with an accuracy that didn\u2019t seem possible.But as Mr. Hinton himself points out, his idea has had its limits. If a neural network is trained on images that show a coffee cup only from a side, for example, it is unlikely to recognize a coffee cup turned upside down.Now Mr. Hinton and Sara Sabour, a young Google researcher, are exploring an alternative mathematical technique that he calls a capsule network. The idea is to build a system that sees more like a human. If a neural network sees the world in two dimensions, a capsule network can see it in three.Ms. Sabour is an Iranian researcher who wound up in Toronto after the United States government denied her a visa to study computer vision at the University of Washington.Her task is to turn Mr. Hinton\u2019s conceptual idea into a mathematical reality, and the project is bearing fruit. They recently published a paper showing that in certain situations their method can more accurately recognize objects when viewing them from unfamiliar angles.\u201cIt can generalize much better than the traditional neural nets everyone is now using,\u201d Ms. Sabour said.When I walked into his office this month, Mr. Hinton, dressed in his usual button-down shirt and sweater, handed me two large white blocks. They looked like something he had found at the bottom of an old toy chest.He explained that the blocks were two halves of a pyramid, and he asked if I could put the pyramid back together. That didn\u2019t seem too hard. The blocks were oddly shaped, but each had only five sides. All I had to do was find the two sides that matched and line them up. But I couldn\u2019t.Most people fail this test, he told me, including two tenured professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One declined to try, and the other insisted it wasn\u2019t possible. It is possible. But we all failed, Mr. Hinton explained, because the puzzle undercuts the natural way we see something like a pyramid.We do not recognize an object by looking at one side and then another and then another. We picture the whole thing sitting in three-dimensional space. And because of the way the puzzle cuts the pyramid in two, it prevents us from picturing it in 3-D space as we normally would.With his capsule networks, Mr. Hinton aims to finally give machines the same three-dimensional perspective that humans have \u2014 allowing them to recognize a coffee cup from any angle after learning what it looks like from only one. This is not something that neural networks can do.\u201cIt is a fact that is ignored by researchers in computer vision,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is a huge mistake.\u201dLoosely modeled on the web of neurons in the human brain, neural networks are algorithms that can learn discrete tasks by identifying patterns in large amounts of data. By analyzing thousands of car photos, for instance, a neural network can learn to recognize a car.This mathematical idea dates back to the 1950s, but the concept has found real-world applications in recent years, thanks to improvements in processing power and the large amounts of data generated by the internet. Over the last five years, neural networks have accelerated the progress of everything from smartphone digital assistants to language translation services to autonomous robots.But these methods are still a long way from delivering machines with true intelligence \u2014 and new research is needed to deliver the kinds of autonomous machines that so many of the top tech companies are now promising, including conversational computers and driverless cars.Mr. Hinton, who is a kind of godfather figure for the A.I. community, is part of a small but increasingly vocal group of specialists who are working to push the industry into these alternative areas of research.Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, based in Seattle, lamented what he called the industry\u2019s myopia. Its current focus on neural networks, he said, will hurt the progress of A.I. in the long run.Eric Horvitz, who oversees much of the A.I. work at Microsoft, argued that neural networks and related techniques were small advances compared with technologies that would arrive in the years to come.\u201cRight now, what we are doing is not a science but a kind of alchemy,\u201d he said.Mr. Hinton acknowledges that his project in Toronto has so far shown only preliminary results. And others, like Mr. Etzioni and Mr. Horvitz, believe that very different techniques will be needed to achieve truly intelligent machines. Mr. Etzioni said that although machine learning methods would remain at the center of A.I. work, they must be augmented with other techniques. They are fundamentally limited because they learn from data. The right data isn\u2019t always available.But Mr. Hinton believes his capsule networks can eventually expand to a wider array of situations, accelerating the progress of computer vision and things like conversational computing. Capsule networks are an attempt to mimic the brain\u2019s network of neurons in a more complex and structured way, and he explained that this added structure could help other forms of artificial intelligence as well.He certainly understands that many will be skeptical of his technique. But Mr. Hinton also pointed out that five years ago, many were skeptical of neural networks.\u201cHistory is going to repeat itself,\u201d he said. \u201cI think.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Women\u2019s Whisper Network Raises Its Voice", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey called themselves the Glass Ceiling Club.A group of young and ambitious women in the 1990s from the investment bank Bear Stearns would gather at local restaurants every couple of months to discuss how to make the workplace more female friendly. The conversations would inevitably turn to their male colleagues, including the ones who behaved badly, said Maureen Sherry, a former managing director, who met regularly with the other women.\u201cOf course, our conversations would revert to sharing facts we knew about the men we worked with,\u201d recalled Ms. Sherry, who spent nine years at Bear Stearns before leaving in 2000, adding, \u201cyes, it was mostly the same men who preyed on young women.\u201dFor women who had to interact with some of the most notorious sexual harassers, Ms. Sherry said she recommended they stay on the trading floor \u2014 a very public space.\u201cSurvival hints like that were shared pretty freely,\u201d Ms. Sherry wrote in an email.That was the whisper network at work.For as long as women have been in the labor force, this kind of behind-the-scenes support system has served as a vital source of shared information and a safe space for communal commiseration. Advice on salary negotiations, office politics and the work-life balance would be disseminated through informal conversations at cubicles, in cafeterias and over drinks at happy hour.But the network also allowed employees to clue each other into a spectrum of behavior that was often unseen or ignored by their employers \u2014 the boss who scoffs at maternity leave, the manager known for ribald jokes, the colleague rumored to be a groper, or worse.Now, with the internet offering a clearinghouse for complaints \u2014 intensified by the outpouring of allegations against prominent figures like the producer Harvey Weinstein \u2014 whisper networks have been amplified. Through public forums, invitation-only Facebook groups, private Google surveys, locked websites and shielded threads on anonymous apps, women \u2014 and some men \u2014 are seeking catharsis and validation by sharing their stories.\u201cWe\u2019re in this interesting period right now, kind of a hopeful period, where having prominent people name and talk about harassment has put a heightened awareness of it on the table,\u2019\u2019 said Fatima Goss Graves, chief executive of the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\u201cWhen you have one person come forward, they become a huge target,\u201d she added, \u201cbut when more people come out, it\u2019s hard to go after all of them.\u201dIn many cases, the network is driven by firsthand knowledge. Other times, it can be pure speculation. Allegations are often made anonymously and can quickly spread in online forums, damaging reputations before the accused can defend themselves. Men targeted by whisper networks complain of being subject to vigilantism and public shaming; some have threatened legal action.At Bear Stearns \u2014 which was sold to JPMorgan Chase in 2008, during the financial crisis \u2014 the Glass Ceiling Club would warn others about the senior manager who had a history of affairs and a tendency to relocate his previous liaisons to remote offices, recalled Ms. Sherry, who last year published a semi-autobiographical novel, \u201cOpening Belle,\u2019\u2019 about her experiences.The women in the whisper network \u201cweren\u2019t best girlfriends,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Sherry said.\u201cWhat we did have in common was that we were ambitious professionals with the common goal of a more equal place of employment and so yes, that included our perplexity over outrageous behavior that went unchecked.\u201cBut when the whisper network moves onto social media platforms, accusations can gather momentum and quickly yield results.In early October, a number of women came forward on Twitter to accuse Andy Signore, the creator of the popular YouTube series \u201cHonest Trailers\u201d and \u201cScreen Junkies,\u201d of sexual harassment.In a statement through his lawyer, Yana Henriks, Mr. Signore denied any allegations of sexual assault, harassment or retaliation. He said that Defy Media used the allegations made against him as an opportunity to deprive him of his ownership stake in the company.Social media helps retain and spread what Ms. Graves, of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, calls \u201cinstitutional memory.\u201d A written story is easier to pass along than a spoken one, even if the original teller is anonymous, based in another office or leaves the company, she said.The invitation-only Facebook group Tech Ladies provides information on job openings and invitations to networking events. But it also has a discussion called #HelpASisterOut where members can solicit advice about how to come forward with a harassment complaint or to ask about a company\u2019s reputation or culture.\u201cWhat we\u2019ll see is someone post that they are applying for a job at a company and ask if anyone has any good or bad stories about it,\u201d said Allison Esposito, the founder of Tech Ladies. \u201cIf it was great, you\u2019ll see that in the comments. But if it wasn\u2019t, people will say \u2018DM me\u2019 or \u2018let\u2019s take it to the phone,\u2019 to share the information.\u201dAn app called Blind allows all employees from more than 100 companies, including Google, Facebook, Amazon and Airbnb, to sign up through their work email but then chat anonymously about office and industry issues.But in the past year, Blind has also become a hotbed for frank talk about sexual harassment.Outlets now abound for women \u2014 especially younger, newer employees \u2014 who might be left out of tightly guarded cliques of trust at work.In private Facebook groups, women in the comedy profession share a list of men who have been banned from various venues across the country for inappropriate sexual behavior.The anonymity attached to some allegations has spurred debate. A Google spreadsheet that named dozens of men in the media world, identifying individuals with descriptions ranging from leering to sexual harassment to assault, drew a mixed reaction when it was publicized in October.Some applauded the public outing of the men who were accused. But others were outraged that the document had been widely disseminated, that the allegations had been made anonymously and the accused given no opportunity to defend or remove themselves from the list.For Amanda Aiken, the whisper network worked. Sort of.Ms. Aiken was a new paralegal at a small Canadian real estate investment firm when, during a company event in 2011, a top executive repeatedly tried to cajole her into going back to his home.\u201cHis entire body was touching mine \u2014 I would try to get away from him, physically move away, and he would try to follow me,\u201d she recalled in an interview.In the following days, she learned that several other female colleagues had similar stories, including her friend, Erin Carson. After word filtered up to management, the women were soon summoned to a meeting with one of the company\u2019s owners to discuss their allegations.\u201cThere was some anger, there were some tears,\u201d Ms. Carson, a receptionist at the firm in Victoria, B.C., said in an interview. \u201cBut it was kind of reassuring to know we weren\u2019t alone.\u201dThe executive left the company soon afterward. Ms. Aiken quit her job, citing a lingering feeling of awkwardness.\u201cToo many women have commented about how they just gave up because men didn\u2019t listen when we said no and we felt powerless,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to get my power back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Anyone Good Enough for an H-1B Visa?", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSix months ago I won the lottery \u2014 the H-1B visa processing lottery for skilled foreign workers. I called my thrilled parents and celebrated with friends. I\u2019m from northeastern China and have an M.B.A. from Stanford, and was planning to stay in Silicon Valley to help start a company based on a promising new technology to improve the use of data. I was overjoyed because, historically, being selected in the lottery was a near guarantee that an applicant could remain in this country at least three more years.But at the end of July, I received the dreaded Request for Further Evidence from immigration authorities. I provided the extra information that United States Citizenship and Immigration Services asked for. In September, I got another request. I complied again. Finally, on Oct. 11, half a year after my celebration, I learned I had been denied a visa.After earning law degrees in China and at Oxford, after having worked in Hong Kong as a lawyer at a top international firm, after coming to United States three years ago for an M.B.A. and graduating and joining a start-up, I was given just 60 days to leave the country. I have 17 days left.Many of my fellow international students are in situations similar to mine. Some had job offers from companies like Google, Apple and PwC when they learned that their applications had been denied or did not even make it into the lottery. For those whose employers have only United States offices, losing the lottery meant losing jobs and going home, with no real way to use the skills they were on the verge of contributing to the American economy.My two requests for evidence asked me to prove my job was a \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d \u2014 that is, work that only someone with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher can do. My work involves artificial intelligence and big data, and my letters of support came from an authority in my industry and veteran start-up investor, and a Nobel Prize winner. But it wasn\u2019t enough to convince the government that my job requires advanced skills.It\u2019s true that I\u2019m brokenhearted about missing the chance to return to China to care for my mother (she insisted that I stay and pursue the visa that was her dream for me), but I\u2019m not looking for sympathy. As much as I hate to leave, I know I will be fine.Rather, I\u2019m frustrated, because I know I\u2019m part of a pattern: America is losing many very skilled workers because of its anti-immigrant sentiment, and while this is a disappointing blow to me and my classmates, it will also be a blow to the United States\u2019 competitiveness in the global economy. Tech giants such as Google and Tesla were founded by immigrants.I can\u2019t make sense of why an administration that claims to want this country to be strong would be so eager to get rid of us. We are losing our dreams, and America is losing the value we bring.As I make plans to go back to China, I find myself wondering: If I am not qualified to stay in the United States, then who is?Frida Yu is a lawyer and entrepreneur.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Washington Has Delivered a Tangled Message on AT&T\u2019s Power", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "Loosening rules on internet providers would let big companies charge more for their services. But a suit to block a merger signals a tougher stance against big business.Supported byIn a matter of hours this week, the Trump administration twice weighed in on one of the central issues shaping business and society today \u2014 just how much market power big companies should be allowed to amass.Yet in back-to-back developments, two federal agencies arrived at starkly different conclusions, and one company, AT&T, found itself on opposite sides of the debate.In each development, there are signs that the Trump administration is trying to reckon with a media and telecommunications industry that has become intensely concentrated in recent years; most Americans now get their internet and phone services from one of a few providers, and most TV shows and movies are produced by a handful of big companies.But there is so far no clear view about how Washington will navigate this constantly shifting terrain in the future.\u201cWe have one government, but two separate agencies with opposing views,\u201d said Spencer Kurn, an analyst at New Street Research. \u201cYou\u2019ve got one agency saying that marrying content and distribution results in too much market power, and another agency saying there\u2019s no problem with a distributor favoring their content over someone else\u2019s.\u201dAT&T stands to gain from the rollback of net neutrality rules. It could charge companies and consumers more for high-speed internet access, and use its market influence to hinder content providers it competes against.\u201cIt\u2019s an \u2018open the champagne bottles\u2019 moment for AT&T,\u201d said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia University who coined the term net neutrality \u2014 the concept of providing equal access to the internet. \u201cThey can just tell people to pony up.\u201dBut AT&T\u2019s long-term aspirations could be dealt a severe blow if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking its takeover of Time Warner.On Tuesday, President Trump signaled his approval of the lawsuit. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve always felt that that was a deal that\u2019s not good for the country,\u201d he said in response to a question from reporters. If the merger was approved, he suggested, \u201cI think your pricing is going to go up.\u201dFor all the good a rollback of net neutrality rules would do AT&T, the company is looking to diversify. Its core businesses of delivering phone, internet and satellite television services are maturing. A big move into the content business would expand the company\u2019s sources of revenue, and give it new opportunities for cost savings.One of AT&T\u2019s biggest competitors, Comcast, has already married content and distribution with the acquisition of NBCUniversal. If the government succeeds in preventing the Time Warner deal, it will raise sharp questions about the future of AT&T, and its competitors.\u201cThis could be a watershed event for future business combinations in media,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. \u201cDoes this mean Comcast will be broken up?\u201dThere is no evidence that the decisions by the Justice Department and the F.C.C. were coordinated.Instead, the diverging decisions reflect an effort by different agencies trying to come to grips with a radically transformed media and telecommunications landscape, one where Silicon Valley companies are suddenly powerhouses in content creation, and traditional media companies exert vast influence over how information flows across the internet.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely getting mixed messages from the administration,\u201d said Larry Downes, project director for the Center for Business and Public Policy at Georgetown University.The Justice Department\u2019s decision to intervene in the AT&T deal was the more surprising of the two developments this week. Many antitrust experts believe that the government\u2019s case against the deal is weak, because it is a so-called vertical merger, bringing together two businesses that do not compete directly with each other.But the lawsuit is a sign that the Justice Department is beginning to think about antitrust enforcement in fundamentally new ways.The decision by the F.C.C. to roll back net neutrality rules was less surprising, but has equally far-reaching implications. With less regulation, big internet providers will be able to charge more for their services, extract new fees from websites and block content.\u201cThe F.C.C. is saying that they\u2019re going to give up any legal authority over regulating high-speed internet,\u201d said Susan Crawford, a professor at Harvard Law School. \u201cThey\u2019re handing the power to choose winners and losers online to about five companies.\u201dDespite the seeming irreconcilability of the moves by the Justice Department and the F.C.C., some see a common narrative in the two decisions.\u201cThey\u2019re both defense strategies against Silicon Valley,\u201d Mr. Wu said.By rolling back net neutrality, the government is giving old-school media companies like AT&T and Comcast more leverage over companies like Netflix, Google and Facebook that are increasingly becoming their competitors. And by challenging the AT&T merger with Time Warner, the Justice Department could be laying the groundwork for a new approach to antitrust enforcement that could be used to go after big technology firms.Barry Diller, the media mogul and chairman of IAC, which owns a host of websites including Match.com and Vimeo, cited the power of tech companies in expressing exasperation at the Justice Department suit.\u201cIf you think AT&T has too much market power because of distribution, tell me what happens if you are Facebook and Google, which have unbelievable concentration in distribution,\u201d Mr. Diller said. \u201cHow would you ever be able to get a content addition to Google?\u201dAnd there is another school of thought suggesting that more vigorous antitrust enforcement might have obviated the need for net neutrality rules in the first place.If regulators had been stricter about ensuring robust competition among internet service providers over the years, the theory goes, big firms like AT&T would not be able to operate in ways that harm competition.\u201cNet neutrality was a distant-second-best remedy,\u201d Mr. Sagers said. \u201cIf we could have competition in internet service provision, that would have been way better than relying on the F.C.C.\u201dEven if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking AT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner, the opportunity to use antitrust enforcement as a means to give consumers more choice among internet providers has likely passed. And now, by unwinding net neutrality rules, Mr. Sagers said, the Trump administration will make it easier for big companies like AT&T to maintain the already enormous power it has amassed through earlier consolidation.\u201cIf you want to have a monopoly,\u201d he said, \u201cthe government can be your best friend.\u201dJohn Koblin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But similar strategies will be used as long as we let companies choose the location of their profits.A potential fix would be to allocate the taxable profits made by multinationals proportionally to the amount of sales they make in each country.Such a reform would quash artificial profit-shifting. Corporations may be able to shift around profits, assets, and subsidiaries, but they cannot move all their customers to Bermuda.One advantage of allocating taxable profits as I suggest is that this reform can be adopted unilaterally. There is no need for the United States (or any other nation that wants to cut down on tax avoidance) to obtain permission from anybody.But we\u2019d still face an equally daunting problem, the far more shadowy \u2013 and ultimately illegal \u2013 tax evasion of ultrawealthy individuals, many of them with net worths already bolstered by the proceeds of corporate tax avoidance. Here\u2019s an example.Meet Michael. Michael is the (fictional) chief executive and owner of an American company, Michael & Company. Like many people, he would like to pay as little in taxes as possible. But unlike most people, he can take some steps that will allow him to do just that.Michael & Co.AmericaAnonymous Shell Co. Inc.Cayman IslandsMichael & Co.AmericaAnonymous Shell Co. Inc.BankCyprusCayman IslandsMichael & Co.AmericaAnonymous Shell Co. Inc.BankCyprusCayman IslandsMichael & Co.AmericaAnonymous Shell Co. Inc.BankCyprusCayman IslandsThe transaction generates a paper trail that can appear legitimate at first glance. But the reality is more insidious. By paying for fictitious consulting, Michael fraudulently reduces the taxable profits of Michael & Company, and thus the amount of corporate income tax he pays.And once the money has arrived in Cyprus, it is invested in global financial markets and generates income that the Internal Revenue Service can tax only if Michael reports it or if his  Cypriot bank informs the I.R.S.And meanwhile, in America, if he wants to use any of the money stashed in Cyprus, he can simply go to an ATM and make a withdrawal from his offshore account.We can stop offshore tax evasion by shining some light on darker corners of the global banking industry. The most compelling way to do this would be to create comprehensive registries recording the true individual owners of real estate and financial securities, including equities, bonds and mutual fund shares.One common objection to financial registries is that they would impinge on privacy. Yet countries have maintained property records for land and real estate for decades. These records are public, and epidemics of abuse are hard to come by.The notion that a register of financial wealth would be a radical departure is wrong. And the benefits would be enormous, as comprehensive registries would make it possible to not only reduce tax evasion, but also curb money laundering, monitor international capital flows, fight the financing of terrorism and better measure inequality.The onus here is on the United States and the European Union. Why do we allow criminals, tax evaders and kleptocrats to ultimately use our financial and real estate markets to launder their wealth?

{"Headline": "Justices Seem Ready to Boost Protection of Digital Privacy", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 At a lively Supreme Court argument on Wednesday, a majority of the justices seemed troubled by the government\u2019s ability to acquire troves of digital data without a warrant.\u201cMost Americans, I still think, want to avoid Big Brother,\u201d said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. \u201cThey want to avoid the concept that government will be able to see and locate you anywhere you are, at any point in time.\u201dThe argument lasted 20 minutes longer than the usual hour. By its conclusion, at least five justices seemed prepared to limit the government\u2019s power to obtain records from cellphone companies showing their customers\u2019 locations over long periods of time. But there was no consensus about a rationale for a decision or about how far the court was prepared to go to reshape longstanding constitutional doctrines that allow the government to obtain business records held by third parties.The case concerns Timothy Ivory Carpenter, who was convicted of participating in a series of robberies, based in part on records provided by his cellular carrier showing his movements over several months. Nathan Freed Wessler, a lawyer for Mr. Carpenter, said prosecutors had violated the Fourth Amendment, which bars unreasonable searches, by failing to get a warrant for the information.A ruling in Mr. Carpenter\u2019s favor could revise a fundamental Fourth Amendment principle: that people have no reasonable expectation of privacy when they voluntarily turn over information to a third party, like a phone company.Some justices said they were wary of acting rashly and worried about the consequences of a ruling in favor of Mr. Carpenter.\u201cThis new technology is raising very serious privacy concerns,\u201d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. told Mr. Wessler, \u201cbut I need to know how much of existing precedent you want us to overrule or declare obsolete.\u201dThe court\u2019s decision in the case, Carpenter v. United States, No. 16-402, will apply the Fourth Amendment, drafted in the 18th century, to a world in which people\u2019s movements are continually recorded by devices in their pockets and cars, by toll plazas and by transit systems.\u201cA great many highly sensitive digital records,\u201d Mr. Wessler said, \u201clike search queries entered into Google, a person\u2019s complete web browsing history showing everything we read online, medical information or fertility tracking data from a smartphone would be vulnerable\u201d unless the Supreme Court acts.The justices seemed at odds over how to address the issue. Several said the problem was that the level of detail in Mr. Carpenter\u2019s phone records violated his reasonable expectation of privacy. Others, notably Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, took a different approach, saying the problem was that the records were his property and should not have been disclosed without his consent or a warrant.Michael R. Dreeben, a lawyer for the federal government, urged the justices not to take drastic action. \u201cThe technology here is new,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the legal principles that this court has articulated under the Fourth Amendment are not.\u201dJustice Elena Kagan said the case concerning GPS devices provided a close analogy to the new case, particularly as cell tower location data becomes more precise. \u201cIn both cases,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have a new technology that allows for 24/7 tracking and a conclusion by a number of justices in Jones that that was an altogether new and different thing that did intrude on people\u2019s expectations of who would be watching them when.\u201dBut the majority in the Jones decision relied on property rights to justify the ruling, saying the police were not entitled to attach a device to a suspect\u2019s car. Justice Gorsuch indicated that a similar theory could justify a ruling for Mr. Carpenter.\u201cOne thing Jones taught us \u2014 and reminded us, really \u2014 is that the property-based approach to privacy also has to be considered, not just the reasonable expectation approach,\u201d he said.Justice Alito said the earlier decisions tolerated substantial intrusions into privacy. \u201cWhy is cell site location information more sensitive than bank records, particularly today, when a lot of people don\u2019t use cash much, if at all?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt will not only disclose everything that the person buys, it will not only disclose locations, but it will disclose things that can be very sensitive. \u201cMr. Wessler said the location information generated by cell towers was more intrusive. \u201cNever has the government had this kind of time machine that allows them to aggregate a long period of people\u2019s movements over time,\u201d he said.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said it may be a fiction to say that using a cellphone involves a voluntary decision to turn over information to a cellular carrier. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have a choice these days if you want to have a cellphone,\u201d he said.Justice Sotomayor went further. \u201cI don\u2019t, but I know that most young people have the phones in the bed with them,\u201d she said. \u201cI know people who take phones into public restrooms. They take them with them everywhere. It\u2019s an appendage now for some people.\u201dA federal law, the Stored Communications Act, does require prosecutors to go to court to obtain tracking data, but the showing they must make under the law is not probable cause, the standard for a warrant. Instead, they must demonstrate only that there were \u201cspecific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the records sought \u201care relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\u201dJustice Anthony M. Kennedy said the balance struck by Congress was entitled to deference. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we give very significant weight to the Congress\u2019s determination?\u201d he asked.Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who seemed inclined to vote for Mr. Carpenter, worried that the court\u2019s decision could be too sweeping, imperiling all sorts of investigations.Several justices questioned whether people using cellphones know that they are leaving a digital trail of their whereabouts over time. Justice Kennedy said it was common knowledge.\u201cIf I know it,\u201d he said, \u201ceverybody does.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tim Wu: Why the Courts Will Have to Save Net Neutrality", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBack in 2005, a small phone company based in North Carolina named Madison River began preventing its subscribers from making phone calls using the internet application Vonage. As Vonage was a competitor in the phone call market, Madison River\u2019s action was obviously anticompetitive. Consumers complained, and the Federal Communications Commission, under Michael Powell, its Republican-appointed chairman, promptly fined the company and forced it to stop blocking Vonage.That was the moment when \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules went from a mere academic proposal to a part of the United States legal order. On that foundation \u2014 an open internet, with no blocking \u2014 much of our current internet ecosystem was built.Allowing such censorship is anathema to the internet\u2019s (and America\u2019s) founding spirit. And by going this far, the F.C.C. may also have overplayed its legal hand. So drastic is the reversal of policy (if, as expected, the commission approves Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal next month), and so weak is the evidence to support the change, that it seems destined to be struck down in court.The problem for Mr. Pai is that government agencies are not free to abruptly reverse longstanding rules on which many have relied without a good reason, such as a change in factual circumstances. A mere change in F.C.C. ideology isn\u2019t enough. As the Supreme Court has said, a federal agency must \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.\u201d Given that net neutrality rules have been a huge success by most measures, the justification for killing them would have to be very strong.It isn\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s very weak. From what we know so far, Mr. Pai\u2019s rationale for eliminating the rules is that cable and phone companies, despite years of healthy profit, need to earn even more money than they already do \u2014 that is, that the current rates of return do not yield adequate investment incentives. More specifically, Mr. Pai claims that industry investments have gone down since 2015, the year the Obama administration last strengthened the net neutrality rules.But Mr. Pai faces a more serious legal problem. Because he is killing net neutrality outright, not merely weakening it, he will have to explain to a court not just the shift from 2015 but also his reasoning for destroying the basic bans on blocking and throttling, which have been in effect since 2005 and have been relied on extensively by the entire internet ecosystem.This will be a difficult task. What has changed since 2004 that now makes the blocking or throttling of competitors not a problem? The evidence points strongly in the opposite direction: There is a long history of anticompetitive throttling and blocking \u2014 often concealed \u2014 that the F.C.C. has had to stop to preserve the health of the internet economy. Examples include AT&T\u2019s efforts to keep Skype off iPhones and the blocking of Google Wallet by Verizon. Services like Skype and Netflix would have met an early death without basic net neutrality protections. Mr. Pai needs to explain why we no longer have to worry about this sort of threat \u2014 and \u201cYou can trust your cable company\u201d will not suffice.Moreover, the F.C.C. is acting contrary to public sentiment, which may embolden the judiciary to oppose Mr. Pai. Telecommunications policy does not always attract public attention, but net neutrality does, and polls indicate that 76 percent of Americans support it. The F.C.C., in short, is on the wrong side of the democratic majority.In our times, the judiciary has increasingly become a majoritarian force. It alone, it seems, can prevent narrow, self-interested factions from getting the government to serve unseemly and even shameful ends. And so it falls to the judiciary to stop this latest travesty.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The President Who Politicked Oklahoma Back to the Top", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNORMAN, Okla. \u2014 College football fans tend to prefer that university presidents be seen, not heard. The University of Oklahoma\u2019s president, David L. Boren, has been a flagrant violator of that precept.In fact, Boren, 76, was a politician, elected as a United States senator three times and as his state\u2019s governor before that. In the early 1990s, the man some would later characterize as a loose-lipped, absent-minded professor won 83 percent of the vote \u2014 as a Democrat in a red state \u2014 and served as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\u201cDavid Boren is a 3-D chess player in a world of checkers players,\u201d Tom Cole, a Republican congressman whose district includes Oklahoma\u2019s campus in Norman, said.Boren\u2019s apparently counterproductive statements had their motives, he said: to try to sway a fellow Big 12 member, Texas, from committing to its own sports network in partnership with ESPN, which \u2014 as Boren predicted \u2014 has hindered the Big 12 in a variety of ways; to urge conference members to consider expanding the league at a time Boren thought that wise; and to reject that expansion when many thought it was a fait accompli.Known for that C-suite skill of running a great meeting, Boren has unabashedly exploited his political savvy as well as his institution\u2019s strength. He gained a special opportunity to flex these muscles last year when he served as chairman of the Big 12\u2019s board of directors as the conference prepared to consider adding a football championship game, which it did, and when it discussed expanding beyond its 10-institution membership, which it did not.That first championship game will be played Saturday at the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex., between No. 10 Texas Christian (10-2) and No. 2 Oklahoma (11-1), for whom a win will cement a spot in this season\u2019s playoff but a loss will most likely end any hope of qualifying. However, since the game is a rematch of the conference\u2019s two best teams \u2014 unlike most other leagues\u2019 title games, which feature the winners of two divisions \u2014 it could backfire. Boren stands to absorb the credit or soak up the blame depending on the outcome.But the decision not to expand the Big 12 is the one that will prove momentous. It quietly enhanced Oklahoma\u2019s enviable position in a shifting landscape. Should there be another round of conference realignment, Oklahoma, one of college sports\u2019 most valuable brands, may possess more leverage than any other institution, and for that it can thank someone who understands power \u2014 who has it, and how to exert it.\u201cWhat was my responsibility as a senator?\u201d Boren said in an interview in September. \u201cLook at the long-term national interest, but certainly look after Oklahoma \u2014 and realize that every other senator was looking after their states.\u201dAt a Big 12 meeting in Kansas City, Mo., in 2010, as rumors about conference realignment swirled, each member\u2019s representatives were asked to declare whether their university was in or out, recalled R. Bowen Loftin, who was president of Texas A&M at the time.The Big 12 was already a Frankenstein\u2019s monster, cobbled together in the mid-1990s as an arranged marriage of the fragile Big Eight and four Texas teams from the disintegrating Southwest Conference. Now it was trying to navigate a wave of conference restructuring fueled by billions in television money.Nebraska would depart, its representatives indicated at that meeting. The Cornhuskers\u2019 move to the Big Ten effectively kicked off the musical chairs of the years that followed, in which the Big 12 lost four members \u2014 all huge public universities with esteemed athletic pedigrees \u2014 to other leagues.Though most of the Big 12\u2019s chief executives attended the meeting, Boren did not. \u201cHe later told me he wished he had been there,\u201d Loftin said.When Boren assumed the presidency in 1994, the Sooners were coming off their first nonwinning season in almost 40 years. But since the hiring of Bob Stoops as head coach in 1999, Oklahoma is 201-49, with a national title. Boren\u2019s handpicked athletic director, Joe Castiglione, is in his 20th season, and a transition from the retired Stoops to his former assistant Lincoln Riley this season has gone smoothly, with Oklahoma 11-1, with wins over the highly ranked teams Texas Christian and Ohio State.But if Boren was engaged in Oklahoma athletics, which has also achieved notable success in basketball, gymnastics and softball, conference business was beyond his ken.\u201cTo be honest, the daily details of running the conference don\u2019t fascinate me,\u201d Boren said.That changed after that fateful 2010 meeting. Boren dived into conference business: Soon he was deliberating over invitations to Oklahoma from other leagues; trying in vain to keep Texas A&M and Missouri from heading to the Southeastern Conference; helping decide whom to add to the Big 12 from a number of eager prospects in the Atlantic Coast Conference and elsewhere, at one point fielding a call from his former Senate colleague Mitch McConnell asking that McConnell\u2019s alma mater, Louisville, be considered for Big 12 membership.When the realignment music finally stopped, the Big 12\u2019s 10-team composition made it the smallest of the Power 5 conferences, and this stature \u2014 and related lack of a championship game \u2014 kept its co-champions out of the inaugural playoff in 2014 (prompting Boren\u2019s \u201cpsychologically disadvantaged\u201d remark) and, according to a widely reported consultant\u2019s advisement, would continue to weigh down its champions\u2019 playoff chances.Boren was most interested in adding teams for the same reason Texas\u2019 Longhorn Network made him queasy: He wanted a cable channel for the entire league, along the lines of the successful Big Ten Network and the SEC Network \u2014 and the key, he realized, would be volume: the more teams, the better.\u201cWe should\u2019ve done it,\u201d Boren said, expressing regret at adding only two institutions \u2014 Texas Christian and West Virginia \u2014 when more were on the table in the early years of this decade.The main reason for this decision was that there was no institution attractive enough.\u201cWe got to a place where there wasn\u2019t a candidate school or a couple candidate schools that were capable of garnering the necessary eight votes,\u201d Bob Bowlsby, the Big 12 commissioner, said.It had also become clear to Boren and others that in an era of cord-cutting and digital streaming, the media rights landscape had fundamentally changed, and even 12 members might not ensure a network.\u201cTo have the inventory you need, you\u2019re going to have to get up to 12,\u201d Boren said. \u201cBut if you no longer want to have that anyway \u2014 the market\u2019s taken away the network \u2014 is it so urgent then?\u201dThe same qualities that made the Big 12 amenable to poachers at the beginning of this decade \u2014 a short history, varied commitments to different sports, a central geographic location \u2014 could make it ripe for the picking again.There is uncertainty about what will be best for a college sports program at that moment, given the potential unraveling of the amateur model, television\u2019s future interest and the very viability of football.\u201cThere\u2019s questions about what kind of network we want,\u201d Boren said. \u201cWhat platform do we want? Should we be talking to Google instead of ESPN? I think both. The landscape is changing so rapidly. It\u2019s frightening if you\u2019re in the business.\u201dYet no matter what happens, Oklahoma will still be Oklahoma. While no team can afford to lose forever, a few teams are the athletic equivalent of recession-proof. And Boren has never lost sight of that fact.\u201cIn the midst of this,\u201d the sports media consultant Lee Berke, who has advised Oklahoma, said, referring to business uncertainties, \u201cnobody is creating another Oklahoma, nobody is creating another Texas, nobody is creating another Ohio State.\u201dIf Oklahoma avails itself of new opportunities, last year\u2019s decision not to expand the Big 12 \u2014 a decision shepherded by Boren \u2014 will prove crucial.\u201cIf there had been expansion,\u201d Boren said, \u201cI think grant-of-rights extension would have almost had to have been a part of it.\u201dThat is, a new agreement almost certainly would have bound the Big 12 together beyond 2025, tying Oklahoma\u2019s hands at the very moment it may need to be free. (A Big 12 spokesman did not contradict this analysis, and said expansion could have led to extending or writing new broadcast deals.)\u201cI want the Big 12 to be here 10 years after I\u2019m president,\u201d Boren said.He was acknowledging that it would not be up to him.

We don\u2019t like this reflection, so we blame the mirror, painting ourselves as victims of Silicon Valley manipulation.At the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, squarely blamed the tech companies for Russian interference. \u201cYou bear this responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve created these platforms.\u201dTwitter could work harder to fight hate speech, but that wouldn\u2019t solve other difficult problems like ideological echo chambers and a general dumbing down of the national conversation, because those are also happening in real life. People already seek out cable television channels and newspaper opinion columns that reinforce their views.Facebook\u2019s algorithms may encourage echo chambers, but that\u2019s because the company figured out what users want. Have you really never unfriended, unfollowed or muted someone who didn\u2019t agree with you?

If Facebook can connect all of humanity, as its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, aims to do, the platform should be able to root out fake news, critics might argue.But misinformation is a legitimately tricky problem, and the wrong approach could give Silicon Valley even more power than it already has.

{"Headline": "Paul Manafort\u2019s Roots Run Deep in a Connecticut City", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW BRITAIN, Conn. \u2014 While Paul Manafort, St. Thomas Aquinas High School class of 1967, was becoming a power-suited political consultant and lobbyist in Washington and around the world, his old Catholic school was bleeding students.Eventually, almost two decades ago, the red brick shell of the school on this scuffed postindustrial city\u2019s east side was abandoned. Adorned only with a few graffiti scrawls and a sign advertising long-discontinued games of Sunday evening bingo, it sat empty until it was sold to a developer last year for $80,000.For years, it seemed as if the fortunes of Mr. Manafort and New Britain \u2014 once famous as the Hardware City, home to corporations like Stanley Tools; now best known in some quarters as the residence of Daym Drops, a prominent YouTube food reviewer \u2014 were on permanently divergent paths.Search for New Britain on Google, and \u201cthe first name that comes up is Paul Manafort,\u201d said Ed McKeon, a filmmaker who grew up in New Britain and now lives nearby in Middletown. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of depressing, you know.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t have anything to do with it,\u201d protested John Whalen, a New Britain resident who works at an aerospace company.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d asked Mayor Erin Stewart, a Republican, shrugging, smiling and sighing. \u201cPeople are born places.\u201d\u201cWhen I was a little boy and I came here, it caught my attention. It was like a big city,\u201d said Mike Valentin, 61, a retired manager at Connecticut Natural Gas who lives across the street from the St. Thomas Aquinas building. He nodded at the old school, whose alumni also include the former N.B.A. star Lamar Odom. \u201cNow this is like a ghost town.\u201dThat was all, of course, before Mr. Manafort became President Trump\u2019s campaign chairman and a target of Robert S. Mueller, the special counsel investigating possible ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election.\u201cHe\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Mr. Valentin said. He was not being complimentary.Manafort Brothers is one of the subcontractors currently erecting a building at the university. The site stands, naturally, on Paul Manafort Drive.\u201cI recognized the name on the side of the building before I recognized it from Trump\u2019s inner circle,\u201d said Josh Ehrenfeld, 30, who works next door to the company\u2019s headquarters.After graduating from St. Thomas Aquinas, Mr. Manafort went to Georgetown University and then into politics.\u201cEveryone was so proud of him for making it,\u201d Mr. Whalen said. \u201cIt was like, local boy made good, doing international consulting.\u201dJust hours before Mr. Manafort surrendered to the authorities on Monday, residents had been glowing about the fact that George Springer, the Houston Astros player who hit a pivotal home run in Game Five of this year\u2019s World Series, hailed from their town.New Britain is also, its partisans like to point out, home to the New Britain Museum of American Art, a jewel full of works by American masters dating to the city\u2019s industrial heyday, and to the country\u2019s second-oldest art league.\u201cThere are just so many unsavory parts,\u201d said Paul Baylock, 65, an artist and former teacher who attended St. Thomas Aquinas a few years after Mr. Manafort. \u201cBut I glory, I really take a lot of pride in the objects and the things New Britain used to make.\u201dShe said she had received two emails calling on the city to rename Paul Manafort Drive, but had declined, explaining that it was not named after the country\u2019s most infamous lobbyist, but his father.\u201cIt\u2019s sad, because all the good work that was done by the father is now being overshadowed by the son,\u201d she said.In interviews, however, the elder Mr. Manafort appeared considerably less popular in memory than he apparently was while still in office. Mayor Manafort was in charge when the local highway, Route 9, cut a path through the middle of the city, dividing it into east and west halves, flattening historic homes and tearing through a blooming downtown.If recent history is any indication, the city may have a hard time convincing people that Paul Manafort Drive should be spared.\u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, Manafort has blood on his hands,\u201d said Alex Kuzma, one of the organizers. \u201cWe realized afterward it was named after his father, and we don\u2019t want to ascribe the sins of the son to the father.\u201dYet there was at least one Trump partisan in New Britain on Wednesday who was proud of this son of New Britain.\u201cHave you ever heard of the Constitution? Innocent until proven guilty. It\u2019s bogus, it\u2019s bogus. He will be vindicated,\u201d said a white-haired woman at the Art League of New Britain who refused to give her name, but described herself as a member of the area\u2019s large Polish community.

That\u2019s a departure from the days when tech start-ups preferred old warehouses and office buildings converted into wide-open loft offices. Full of exposed brick, wooden beams, high ceilings and concrete floors, the funky work spaces gave birth to tech enclaves in places like San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood and Manhattan\u2019s Flatiron district.Tenants in the technology, creative and media industries leased more than 8.5 million square feet in trophy buildings in the United States over the 12 months that ended in the first quarter of 2017, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, the Chicago-based commercial real estate brokerage firm. That amounted to 22 percent of all trophy space leased over the period, a year-over-year increase of seven percentage points. It was also second only to the banking and finance sector in total square feet leased.Recent notable tech deals include Facebook\u2019s lease of 436,000 square feet in a new office and residential tower in downtown San Francisco, Spotify\u2019s lease of 378,000 square feet in 4 World Trade Center in Manhattan and HomeAway\u2019s lease of an entire 315,000-square-foot office building under construction in the Domain mixed-use neighborhood in Austin, Tex.But companies in all sectors today \u2014 not just tech \u2014 are demanding the design elements typically found in the warehouse conversions, such as open floor plans, natural light and exposed ceilings. Along with proximity to transit and amenities, layout is considered an important tool to recruit and retain workers, and developers are obliging tenants in new buildings and those in retrofitted older buildings, particularly modern offices built in the 1980s and later.\u201cIt turns out that we look really smart,\u201d said Mr. Daniels, whose early efforts to develop the Mark were halted by the Great Recession. \u201cBut it was kind of nerve-racking at the time.\u201dReal estate professionals say older buildings generally lack modern energy efficiencies, elevators, bathrooms and data capabilities. The inability to expand in the converted buildings and their scarcity are also restrictive.\u201cWe\u2019re creating an atmosphere of fun, fitness and food, because that\u2019s what tenants are looking for,\u201d Mr. Meghji said. \u201cThe role of landlords has evolved \u2014 today it\u2019s about providing an experience.\u201dMr. Daniels added a hotel and event space to the Mark when he resumed development after the recession. The additions appealed to F5 Networks, which ended up leasing 516,000 square feet of space. The changes helped round out the building\u2019s amenity package, which includes lounges, restaurants and a fitness facility.\u201cIt all brings a lot more life after 5,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \u201cThe younger set really likes to be entertained \u2014 at all times \u2014 whether it\u2019s by food, drink or games. They\u2019ve got to have it.\u201d\u201cSan Francisco certainly has morphed into more of a \u2018big tech\u2019 market, and the companies are all looking at new buildings,\u201d Mr. Sammons said. \u201cI think landlords are feeling much more confident in the market\u2019s long term than they were a couple of years ago, when many tech tenants were start-ups.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No, but automobiles are actually a model for the public health approach I\u2019m suggesting.We don\u2019t ban cars, but we work hard to regulate them \u2013 and limit access to them \u2013 so as to reduce the death toll they cause. This has been spectacularly successful, reducing the death rate per 100 million miles driven by 95 percent since 1921.Take a look at the history of motor vehicle safety since World War II:Deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled19469.3581968  First federal safety standards for cars64201621.18\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910sDeaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled19469.35First seatbelt offered in an American carFirst federal safety standards for cars81974  55 m.p.h. national speed limit1993  Car safety ratings introduced61978  Tennessee is first to require child safety seats1999  Airbags, invented in 1951, become mandatory1984  4New York is first to require seat belt use2000  Mandatory reporting of defects by carmakers201621.18\u201946\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s2000s\u201910s\u201916Frankly, liberal opposition to guns has often been ineffective, and sometimes counterproductive. The 10-year ban on assault weapons accomplished little, partly because definitions were about cosmetic features like bayonet mounts (and partly because even before the ban, such guns were used in only 2 percent of crimes).The left sometimes focuses on \u201cgun control,\u201d which scares off gun owners and leads to more gun sales. A better framing is \u201cgun safety\u201d or \u201creducing gun violence,\u201d and using auto safety as a model\u2014constant efforts to make the products safer and to limit access by people who are most likely to misuse them.What would a public health approach look like for guns if it were modeled after cars? It would include:If someone steals my iPhone, it\u2019s useless, and the same should be true of guns. Gun manufacturers made child-proof guns back in the 19th century (before dropping them), and it\u2019s time to advance that technology today. Some combination of smart guns and safe storage would also reduce the number of firearms stolen in the U.S. each year, now about 200,000, and available to criminals.We also need to figure out whether gun buybacks, often conducted by police departments, are cost-effective and help reduce violence.

The Las Vegas carnage, for example, might not have been prevented by any of the suggestions I make.That\u2019s true, and there\u2019s no magic wand available. Yet remember that although it is mass shootings that get our attention, they are not the main cause of loss of life. Much more typical is a friend who shoots another, a husband who kills his wife \u2013 or, most common of all, a man who kills himself. Skeptics will say that if people want to kill themselves, there\u2019s nothing we can do. In fact, it turns out that if you make suicide a bit more difficult, suicide rates drop.Here are the figures showing that mass shootings are a modest share of the total, and the same is true of self-defense \u2013 despite what the N.R.A. might have you believe.OTHER CAUSESDEATHS INMASSSHOOTINGS:456VICTIMS KILLINGPERPETRATORS INSELF-DEFENSE:589SHARE OF ALLGUN DEATHS:OTHER CAUSESVICTIMS KILLINGPERPETRATORS INSELF-DEFENSE:589DEATHS INMASSSHOOTINGS:456SHARE OF ALLGUN DEATHS:For skeptics who think that gun laws don\u2019t make a difference, consider what happened in two states, Missouri and Connecticut. In 1995, Connecticut tightened licensing laws, while in 2007 Missouri  eased gun laws.The upshot? After tightening gun laws, firearm homicide rates dropped 40 percent in Connecticut. And after Missouri eased gun laws, gun homicide rates rose 25 percent.Connecticut after 1995 lawtightening licensing requirementsEstimated change in\u201340%Estimated change in\u201315%Missouri after 2007 repealof license requirementsEstimated change in+25%Estimated change in+16%Connecticut after 1995 lawtightening licensing requirementsMissouri after 2007 repealof license requirementsEstimated change inrate of gun homicide\u201340%+25%Estimated change inrate of gun suicide\u201315%+16%One of the lessons of gun research is that we often focus just on firearms themselves, when it may be more productive to focus on who gets access to them. A car or gun is usually safe in the hands of a 45-year-old woman with no criminal record, but may be dangerous when used by a 19-year-old felon with a history of alcohol offenses or domestic violence protection orders.Yet our laws have often focused more on weapons themselves (such as the assault weapons ban) rather than on access. In many places, there is more rigorous screening of people who want to adopt dogs than of people who want to purchase firearms.In these two states, the laws affected access, and although there\u2019s some indication that other factors were also involved in Connecticut (and correlations don\u2019t prove causation), the outcomes are worth pondering.There\u2019s simply a scandalous lack of research on gun violence, largely because the N.R.A. is extremely hostile to such research and Congress rolls over. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did try to research gun violence, Congress responded by cutting its funding.Here is the American toll from four diseases and firearms over the years 1973-2012 \u2013 and the number of National Institutes of Health research grants to explore each problem over that same time.N.I.H. research awardsDiseaseNumber of casesRabies6556Polio266212Cholera400129Diphtheria1,33789Firearmsinjuries3>4 millionNumberof casesDiseaseN.I.H. research awardsRabies6589Polio266129Cholera400212Diphtheria1,33756Firearm Injuries3>4 millionOne approach that could reduce the abuse of guns is better training. As a 13-year-old farm boy in Oregon, I attended a N.R.A. gun safety class (which came with a one-year membership to the N.R.A., making me an N.R.A. alum who despises what that organization has become). These classes can be very useful, and audits found that more than 80 percent cover such matters as checking the gun to see if it\u2019s loaded, keeping one\u2019s finger off the trigger until ready to fire and being certain of the target.Yet the audits also suggest that trainers are more likely to advocate for the N.R.A. or for carrying guns than for, say, safe storage. This is a missed opportunity, for all classes should cover the risks of guns and alcohol, the risks of abuse with suicide and domestic violence, the need for safe storage, and so on. Here\u2019s what researchers found that the gun classes they audited actually covered:NOTDISCUSSEDPERCENT OF CLASSESWHERE DISCUSSEDTrainers encouragedgun carrying81%19Encouragedgun ownership7624Prevent unsupervisedaccess by children7030Encouraged gun usefor self-defense69316040Ricochet6040Theft preventionEncouraged membershipin gun-rights group5644Legal ramifications ofshooting in self-defense55455347Child access lawsRecommendation: whennot in use, store unloaded5050Recommendation: usegun only as last resort4555Young childrenand gun accidents55457030Decision-making in crisesTheft is important sourceof firearms used in crime8020Techniques forde-escalating threats8515Recommendation:report stolen firearms9010Watch for signs of suicidein household members90109010Domestic violence riskTopic discussedPercent of classes where discussedNot discussedTrainers encouraged gun carrying1981%Encouraged gun ownership2476Prevent unsupervised access by children3070Encouraged gun use for self-defense3169Ricochet4060Theft prevention4060Encouraged membership in gun-rights group4456Legal ramifications of shooting in self-defense4555Child access laws4753Recommendation: when not in use, store unloaded5050Recommendation: use gun only as last resort5545Young children and gun accidents5545Decision-making in crises7030Theft is an important source of firearms used in crime8020Techniques for de-escalating threats8515Recommendation: report stolen firearms9010Watch for signs of suicide in household members9010Domestic violence risk9010It may sometimes seem hopeless to make progress on gun violence, especially with the N.R.A. seemingly holding Congress hostage. But I\u2019m more optimistic.Look, we all agree on some kinds of curbs on guns. Nobody believes that people should be able to drive a tank down Main Street, or have an anti-aircraft gun in the backyard. I\u2019ve been to parts of northern Yemen where one could actually buy a tank or an anti-aircraft gun, as well as fully automatic weapons \u2014 and that area\u2019s now embroiled in a civil war \u2013 but fortunately in America we have agreed to ban those kinds of weaponry.So the question isn\u2019t whether we will restrict firearms, but where to draw the line and precisely which ones to restrict.Check out these polling numbers as a basis for action on gun safety:Agree with the following:Householdswith no gunsGun households50%Background checksfor all gun buyers93%96%Preventing mentally ill from buying guns8989Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes8885Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists8284Background checks for private sales and at gun shows7787Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases7289Ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun6779A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence6175New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns5771Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence5681Creating a federal database to track gun sales5480A ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines(10+ bullets)*5277Householdswith no gunsGun householdsAgree with the following:50%93%Background checks for all gun buyers96%89Preventing the mentally ill from buying guns89Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes8885Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists8284Background checks for private sales and at gun shows7787Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases7289A ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun6779A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence6175New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns5771Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence5681Creating a federal database to track gun sales5480A ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines (10+ bullets)*5277Looking ahead, I\u2019m optimistic that there can be progress at the state level, and some of the necessary research funding will come from private foundations. Maybe some police departments will put in orders for smart guns to help create a market.But the real impetus for change will come because the public favors it. In particular, note that 93 percent of people even in gun households favor universal background checks for gun purchases.If you\u2019re wondering how we managed to crank out all these charts and data in the immediate aftermath of the Texas shooting, here\u2019s the secret: We didn\u2019t. We spent weeks gathering the information and preparing the charts, because we knew that there would be a tragedy like this one to make it all relevant.That\u2019s the blunt, damning truth: Friday\u2019s school shooting was 100 percent predictable. After each such incident, we mourn the deaths and sympathize with the victims, but we do nothing fundamental to reduce our vulnerability.Some of you will protest, as President Trump did, that it\u2019s too soon to talk about guns, or that it is disrespectful to the dead to use such a tragedy to score political points. Yet more Americans have died from gun violence, including suicides, since 1970 (about 1.4 million) than in all the wars in American history going back to the Revolutionary War (about 1.3 million). And it\u2019s not just gang-members: In a typical year, more pre-schoolers are shot dead in America (about 75) than police officers are.Yes, making America safer will be hard: There are no perfect solutions. The Second Amendment is one constraint, and so is our polarized political system and the power of the gun lobby. It\u2019s unclear how effective some of my suggestions will be, and in any case this will be a long, uncertain, uphill process.But automobiles are a reminder that we can chip away at a large problem through a public health approach: Just as auto safety improvements have left us far better off, it seems plausible to some gun policy experts that a sensible, politically feasible set of public health steps could over time reduce firearm deaths in America by one-third \u2013 or more than 10,000 lives saved each year.So let\u2019s not just shed tears for the dead, give somber speeches and lower flags. Let\u2019s get started and save lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Technologies That Will Rock Your World", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is reason for concern, but also for optimism. The new wave of artificial intelligence will reduce jobs, but will also improve your health and products like your smartphone. Here are five areas where tech companies, large and small, will change the way we live.Such technology will improve health care in places where doctors are scarce. But eventually, it will streamline care in the developed world as well. Google is already running tests inside two hospitals in India, and the start-up Infervision has deployed similar technology in hospitals across China.In the longer term, similar methods promise to rapidly accelerate drug discovery and so many other aspects of health care. \u201cEverything from the nature of the food that we grow and eat to the drugs that we give ourselves to how we monitor the impact of these things is all being transformed by A.I. in deeply profound ways,\u201d said Matt Ocko, a managing partner at DCVC, a San Francisco venture capital firm that has invested heavily in this area.Neural networks are not limited to image recognition. Far from it. These same techniques are rapidly improving coffee-table gadgets like the Amazon Echo, which can recognize spoken commands from across the room, and online services like Skype, which can instantly translate phone calls from one language to another. They may even eventually produce machines that can carry on a conversation.Recently, said Luke Zettlemoyer, a University of Washington professor, there has been a \u201chuge phase shift\u201d in the area of natural language understanding \u2014 technology that understands the natural way people talk and write. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are at the forefront of this movement, which promises to fundamentally change how we interact with phones, cars, and potentially any machine. Many companies are moving down the same path, including Replika, a San Francisco start-up.With help from machine learning, Replika offers a smartphone \u201cchatbot\u201d that acts as a kind of personal confidante, chatting with you in moments when no one else is around. But the hope is that these techniques will improve to where they serve you in so many other ways. What if Alexa was truly conversational, if you could have a back and forth dialogue? Right now, it is about basic questions and commands. Today, it \u201crecognizes\u201d words very very well. But truly \u201cunderstanding\u201d complex English sentences is beyond machines at this point. What if machines could carry on a dialogue like Hal in 2001?Using electroencephalography, or EEG \u2014 a longstanding means of measuring electrical brain activity from sensors placed on the head \u2014 the start-up Neurable is building a virtual reality game that can be played with the mind. EEG is limited for this kind of use, but other researchers, including at Facebook, aim to build a far more powerful systems using optical sensors. Facebook hopes that, in a few years, this technology will let people type with their minds five times faster than they can with a smartphone keyboard.These techniques will also face physical limits, and that may bar the way to Facebook\u2019s goal. But various start-ups, including Neuralink, founded by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, are going several steps further, hoping to read brain activity from chips implanted inside the skull. At first, they will limit this technology to people with disabilities. But ultimately, Mr. Musk and others hope to also implant chips in healthy people.\u201cIt is implausible that this technology would go straight into healthy people,\u201d said Ed Boyden, an M.I.T. neuroscientist who is also an adviser to Neuralink. \u201cBut there is a natural trajectory where, if a medical technology proves effective, it can move into normal individuals as well.\u201dWant more science fiction in your everyday reality? As entrepreneurs like Mr. Musk work to put a chip in your head, others are working to put cars in the skies.At first, Kitty Hawk will sell its vehicles to hobbyists. But the company hopes it can eventually convince the general public, and regulators, that flying cars make sense. That is no easy task. After all, these cars will require a new kind of air traffic control.Even more outlandish? It\u2019s the prospect of a quantum computer. Drawing on the seemingly magical properties of quantum physics, such a machine would be exponentially more powerful than computers of today. Think of it this way: A quantum computer could instantly crack the encryption that protects the world\u2019s most private data.The problem is that these machines are enormously difficult to build. but progress has accelerated. Google, IBM and Intel are investing heavily in this push, as are start-ups like Rigetti Computing.Researchers say they believe that quantum machines eventually could accelerate drug discovery, streamline financial markets, solve traffic problems and more.\u201cIt is a completely different paradigm for processing information,\u201d said Robert Schoelkopf, who helped invent the techniques that are driving so much of quantum computing research. \u201cSo we think that known applications are just the tip of the iceberg.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Night at the Theater From Your Couch? No Apologies Needed.", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThis will be anathema to stage purists, but here goes: I like watching theater on television.Of course, it is not the real thing. There is no smell of the greasepaint, no roar of the crowd. There is no sense of the actors\u2019 physical presence, their breathing and sweat, the way they physically interact with one another. There is no communal joy.But there is theater, and that is something.For many of us growing up in the analog era without access to the stage, television was the only resource. New Yorkers of a certain age would have been familiar with the series \u201cPlay of the Week,\u201d which was broadcast in 1959-61, and with PBS\u2019s \u201cAmerican Playhouse,\u201d from 1982-1994. I grew up in rural France with just three channels, but at least they regularly showed classics and middlebrow comedies; I learned to enjoy both.Now I see a lot of live theater, and yet I still love it on the small screen. Partly so I can see productions that don\u2019t make it to New York, and partly because, although theater is distinguished by the uniqueness of the moment, sometimes you just want to rewind that moment as soon as it\u2019s over.As the Thanksgiving weekend rolls around, with its abundant downtime, here are some online destinations for theater on-demand. Feel free to use your cellphone whenever you want and to crinkle candy wrappers \u2014 nobody will mind.And then there are BroadwayHD\u2019s non-American offerings. I admit turning the volume way up for the fantastically gaudy 2012 British arena tour of \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d starring Tim Minchin, while the West End\u2019s \u201cGypsy\u201d with Imelda Staunton allows us to add a contender to the evergreen argument over who is the best Mama Rose.I barely scratched the surface of subtitled productions, but did enjoy \u201cLa Casa de Bernarda Alba,\u201d a classic from Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca that is rarely produced on English-language stages. This also gave me the opportunity to discover the Argentine stage veteran Mar\u00eda Rosa Fugazot, whose raspy voice is a thing of wonder.This relatively new outfit rewards open-minded explorers, especially those with many stamps in their passports: Little of the material on offer is American.This alone would make Cennarium stand out, but in September it broke new ground with Promenade, a virtual 10-day festival that attempted to foster appointment streaming by broadcasting simultaneous shows every night at 8 p.m. Promenade even tried to create a virtual community with hosts introducing the shows and chat rooms where viewers could discuss what they had just seen.This would have been a godsend to 14-year-old me, alone in the boondocks \u2014 and it might just be a lifeline to isolated arts lovers around the world. We can only hope there will be more Promenades in the future.Catalog items right now include the David Esbjornson production of \u201cDriving Miss Daisy,\u201d featuring the original stars James Earl Jones and Boyd Gaines, but with Angela Lansbury replacing Vanessa Redgrave \u2014 a rather drastic, yet fascinating, switcheroo.Advertisement"}

Declan Walsh, The Times\u2019s Cairo bureau chief, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What tech is most important for you to do your job as our correspondent in Egypt? A dented, screen-cracked iPhone is the center of my work. When I started out as a foreign correspondent 18 years ago, in Kenya, I carried a small satchel that held a tape recorder, a camera, an address book, a map and perhaps a shortwave radio. Today all of that has been squeezed into the thin black slab in my pocket.The Slack messaging app is replacing email as the way Times correspondents communicate with their editors, especially as our operation has spread out across the world. We might work with editors in London, New York or Hong Kong, depending on the story and the time of day.Equally important, you need to know when to put all that technology away. In the more paranoid corners of the Middle East, pulling out a glowing laptop in public is not a great idea.How is connectivity in Cairo and in the region when you travel on assignment? The internet can be teeth-grindingly slow in Egypt, to the point of me yelling, ridiculously, at the screen on deadline.Are Egyptians joined at the hip with their smartphones? Egyptians adore their smartphones. People have crazy-looking cases and a range of dramatic ringtones \u2014 Quranic verses for conservatives, melodramatic pop tunes for everyone else. Lionel Richie\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d and anything by Celine Dion are very popular.The flip side to the smartphone mania is that it also inspires deep paranoia among the police and some ordinary citizens, known popularly here as \u201chonorable citizens.\u201d I know people who\u2019ve been threatened with arrest for taking a photo of the Suez Canal (after the pyramids, one of Egypt\u2019s most famous features). A photographer friend was admonished by an \u201chonorable citizen\u201d for trying to take a photo of the Nile with her phone. He accused her of being a spy.What are the favorite apps or gadgets in Egypt? Are people on Facebook and using Google and Uber?On the streets of Cairo, Uber and Careem, a ride-sharing app that concentrates on the Middle East, are slugging it out for market share. As a result, cab rides can be ridiculously cheap \u2014 just a few dollars to cross town.How does the Egyptian government treat tech like social media and Western apps?With wariness and frequent hostility.All told, it\u2019s a pretty grim picture.Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life right now and why?With the phone banished to another room, I can\u2019t mindlessly scroll Twitter or Instagram at 8 o\u2019clock in the morning, and I enjoy a tiny window of mental peace.

{"Headline": "A Daughter\u2019s Tribute to Her Father and His Taste for Bordeaux", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.This early experience foreshadowed the relationship the adult Fadiman would forever have with wine: Available to her in both quantity and quality, drink has always been dominated by her father\u2019s high expectations, and she partakes first and foremost out of a sense of dutiful obligation.Despite her persistent indifference to wine, Fadiman embraces it as a means of tracing her and her father\u2019s lives in \u201cThe Wine Lover\u2019s Daughter,\u201d which doubles as both a memoir and a biography of the writer and oenophile Clifton Fadiman. It is a testament to the author\u2019s idyllic upbringing that her primary conflict with her father arises from her failure to savor as he does a Cabernet Sauvignon or Pinot Noir \u2014 even though doing so \u201cwould have made my father really, really happy.\u201dBut \u201cThe Wine Lover\u2019s Daughter\u201d is also a portrait of a more complicated relationship: her father\u2019s infatuation with the bottles he fastidiously collected and poured nightly from his crystal decanter. Fadiman\u2019s prior work has established her as a talented anthropologist; her 1997 book, \u201cThe Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down,\u201d a daringly in-depth profile of a Hmong refugee family she\u2019d met in California nearly a decade earlier, won the National Book Critics Circle Award for nonfiction. Turning her keen powers of observation to her father\u2019s love of wine, Fadiman delivers an illuminating and nuanced case study in connoisseurship that probes the dazzling hedonism and gnawing anxieties that fuel an obsession with fermented grape juice.The Fadimans\u2019 lives unfold through wine-themed vignettes centered on feasts and parties in posh dining rooms \u2014 settings preferred by Clifton Fadiman, who considered pizza, lunch counters and \u201cwaitresses who used \u2018au jus\u2019 as a noun instead of a prepositional phrase\u201d intolerably \u201cvulgar.\u201d Fadiman traces this disdain back to her father\u2019s lower-middle-class childhood in Brooklyn. The son of Eastern European Jews who operated unsuccessful drugstores, he quickly concluded that \u201cthings were run by people who spoke well and who were not Jewish, not poor and not ugly.\u201d When he enrolled at Columbia, he set about refashioning himself from what his daughter calls a \u201cmeatball\u201d into \u201cfoie gras\u201d \u2014 something closer to the rich, private-school-educated WASPs who ran things. Wine, along with a cultivated accent \u201cso impeccable no one actually spoke that way except other people from Brooklyn who wished to sound as if they weren\u2019t,\u201d became indispensable accessories; he toasted early career milestones by splurging on Burgundy \u2014 evidence of his ascent to his adopted milieu. (Presuming readers are familiar with her father, the author waits until Chapter 8 to explain that he was a \u201ccelebrated multihyphenate\u201d \u2014 an essayist-columnist-radio-host-etc. who was also the editor in chief of Simon & Schuster, the book critic for The New Yorker and co-author of the encyclopedic \u201cThe Joys of Wine.\u201d)Unmoved by these treasures, the daughter excels in soberly analyzing why her father so adored wine. Mining his essays, tasting notes and letters, she explores the myriad ways these bottles were physically gratifying \u2014 they provided him \u201csensory pleasures equaled only by sex\u201d and \u201ca temporary release every evening from the anxiety that had filled his head or lurked in the wings all day.\u201d They were also intellectually rewarding; with a sip of wine, he \u201cincorporated Western culture: an entire world of history, literature, art and religion, straight down the esophagus.\u201d Anne Fadiman, a gifted writer with an instinct for brilliant detail, conveys the blissful suspense of uncorking a new bottle when she writes, with characteristic feeling, that when her father first tasted a wine, \u201cone could feel the entire world aligning with his aspirations.\u201dYet \u201cThe Wine Lover\u2019s Daughter\u201d occasionally feels short on another quality that drew Clifton to his prized French reds: acid, the sourness that adds complexity to both wine and life. Fadiman generally concedes that her apathy toward wine is not a serious hardship \u2014 an admission that robs the book of some of its tension \u2014 yet she sometimes reaches for drama in ways that strain credibility. In one passage, Fadiman compares her guilt at faking enthusiasm for her father\u2019s red Bandol to \u201ca daughter feeling sure that her kind but conservative father knows she\u2019s gay even though she hasn\u2019t come out to him.\u201d But the stakes are of course incomparable; there is nothing to indicate Fadiman risks being disowned because she doesn\u2019t fawn over first growths, and she shares numerous passions with Clifton, including a career as a writer. There are glimmers of friction between parent and child: Fadiman acknowledges, for example, that her father was a \u201cmale chauvinist\u201d who belittled women and expected less of his daughter than of his sons. She then spins this as a blessing in disguise: It \u201cboth devalued and protected me,\u201d she writes, arguing that the pressure placed on her brothers gave her the freedom to follow in her father\u2019s literary footsteps.While the canon of literary memoirs contains numerous examples of writers grappling with family trauma or struggle, Fadiman breaks with the genre in offering a portrait of a parental relationship that \u2014 differing opinions on Bordeaux aside \u2014 is, well, happy. Indeed, the book is also a study of a daughter\u2019s love for her father \u2014 reverential, deferential, apt to make an agnosticism for wine seem like a significant betrayal. Embedded within is the story of a celebrated writer honoring someone she considers a great, perhaps overlooked, talent, and Fadiman profiles her father with a tenderness that suggests she hopes readers will, in the final calculus, share her high esteem for him. \u201cIf my father were forgotten, the balance of my world would shift so disorientingly that I\u2019d lose my footing,\u201d Fadiman writes. \u201cI still check periodically to make sure he has more Google entries than I do.

{"Headline": "Forget Trump and Discover the World", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMumbai, INDIA \u2014 In a recent MSNBC interview I described President Trump as a \u201cbrain-eating disease.\u201dI did so because his indecent behavior, and nonstop outrageous tweets and actions, force you as a commentator into a terrible choice: either ignore it all and risk normalizing Trump\u2019s excesses or write about him constantly and risk not having the time to learn and report about the big trends now reshaping the world \u2014 trends that one day will surprise your readers and leave them asking, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know this?\u201dTo inoculate myself against Trump eating my brain, I occasionally get as far away as I can. This time it was to India, where I learned a ton that I didn\u2019t know: I found India trying to leapfrog out of poverty and catch up to China by engaging in a rapid digitization of its entire economy and power grid.Yes, while our president has been busy playing golf, tweeting about LaVar Ball and pushing an anything-that-will-pass tax plan, China has been busy creating a cashless society, where people can pay for so many things now with just a swipe of their cellphones \u2014 including donations to beggars \u2014 or even buy stuff at vending machines with just facial recognition, and India is trying to follow suit.These are big trends, and in a world where data is the new oil, China and India are each creating giant pools of digitized data that their innovators are using to write all kinds of interoperable applications \u2014 for cheap new forms of education, medical insurance, entertainment, banking and finance.I was blown away by one big change in India in particular. In 2009, my friend Nandan Nilekani, the tech entrepreneur, led a team of experts that helped the then-Congress Party-led government launch a national digital identity system, known as Aadhaar (Hindi for \u201cbase\u201d).Every Indian, rich or poor, goes into a field office, has fingerprints and irises scanned into a biometric database and then linked to the individual\u2019s 12-digit ID number with basic identifiers: name, address, date of birth and sex. When the Congress Party left office in 2014, and Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party took over, Modi continued and impressively energized the Aadhaar project, bringing it today to 1.18 billion users, out of a population of about 1.3 billion.In a country where many poor people lacked any form of ID, like a birth certificate or a driver\u2019s license, this has been a revolution, because they can now open a bank account and get government aid sent directly to them \u2014 rather than having bureaucrats, bankers or postal workers skim off 30 percent each year through the mail \u2014 and then link their bank account to their mobile phones, from which they can buy, sell, transfer money and receive payments digitally anytime anywhere.The digital network platforms that have broken the one-billion-plus user mark \u2014 like Facebook, Google and WhatsApp \u2014 all came out of the private sector. Aadhaar, noted the Harvard Business Review, is the only non-U.S. platform \u201cto have broken the one-billion-user threshold and the only such system to have been developed by the public sector.\u201d It also has the distinction of \u201chaving reached one billion users the fastest.\u201dWhen the British laid railroads in India it led to the more efficient extraction of natural resources. Now the Indian government, through the combination of a trusted unique ID platform \u2014 tied to cellphones and mobile bank accounts \u2014 is creating a kind of digital railroad enabling the more efficient empowerment of human resources.\u201cIt\u2019s transforming the lives of ordinary people,\u201d explained Alok Kshirsagar, a McKinsey partner based in Mumbai. \u201cMillions are already benefiting from digital payments and credit. There are already more than 30 percent productivity gains when digital capabilities are used in agriculture, transportation and manufacturing. We are in the early stages of a transformation that could generate as much as $1 trillion in economic value over the next seven to 10 years.\u201dNow any Indian farmer can just go to one of 250,000 government community centers \u2014 each with a computer, Wi-Fi and a local entrepreneur who manages it \u2014 log into a government digital services website with the farmer\u2019s unique ID and instantly print out a birth certificate or land records needed for transactions.An Indian friend told me: \u201cMy driver has two bank accounts, and he has given one debit card to his wife and another to his son. And now he tells me he puts X amount of his salary into one account and Y into another, using his cellphone, so his wife is empowered and not asking her mother-in-law for money, because she has her own debit card, and the son, who is off in school training to be a doctor, can be independent.\u201dNilekani and his wife, Rohini, have built a foundation, EkStep, to create mobile education apps to help parents, teachers and students \u2014 armed only with cellphones \u2014 to learn faster, using these new digital networks. As Shankar Maruwada, an EkStep co-founder and its C.E.O., explained: Unlike, say Facebook, whose business model is to \u201cretain your attention,\u201d EkStep, Aadhaar and other such \u201csocietal platforms\u201d are designed to \u201crestore your agency,\u201d particularly to the poor.The West got economically rich \u201cbefore it got data rich,\u201d added Pramod Varma, EKStep\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cSo when data came along, it just became a better way to sell you things. They could target you better; you became a better customer for them. But in a country like India, where per-capita income is $2,000, today you can get data rich before you get economically rich. And if you empower people with their data, they can use their data to get better loans, get better skills, and build a digital repository that captures their skills to get better salaries.\u201dSimilar innovations are going on in energy, explained Mahesh Kolli, president of Greenko, India\u2019s largest renewable power provider. Theft of electricity from state-owned distribution companies amounted to some 20 percent of their output, as people strung wires to siphon from the grid, or the companies couldn\u2019t identify users.Now the government \u201ccan link my unique ID to my electricity bill\u201d and then directly and digitally connect my government subsidy, if I am poor, to that electric bill, said Kolli. Greenko just built the largest solar project in the world \u2014 a 3,000-acre field of Chinese-made solar panels generating 800 megawatts powering over 600,000 homes in Andhra Pradesh. Two more such fields are on the way up, all connecting to the national grid.Oh, and by the way, for those of you who want to preserve coal jobs, this 800-megawatt solar farm \u201cwas built with over 5,000 skilled and semiskilled workers,\u201d said Kolli. \u201cWe believe the renewable energy sector will create over one million new generation jobs to meet the 175-gigawatt target set by Prime Minister Modi.\u201dGreenko builds these plants, he added, \u201cin five months using Chinese panels and European inverter-grid integration technologies made in India.\u201d (Notice the absence of U.S. technology in that loop.) Greenko is also making huge strides in battery technology to store solar energy, so it can be used when the sun is not shining, and the company is now in the midst of building the first grid-connected battery storage system integrated with its solar farms.\u201cNo new coal or gas power plants are being built in India today,\u201d he added, \u201cnot because of regulations, but because solar, wind, hydro are all now able to compete with coal plants without subsidies.\u201dBottom line, the Indian energy economy is rapidly transitioning to a \u201cdecarbonized, digitized and decentralized\u201d system, said Kolli, enabling better quality of life while meeting big energy needs \u2014 without the government having to deal with all the protests that come with building coal- or gas-fired plants.So while we\u2019ve been following Trump\u2019s tweets about bringing back \u201cbeautiful coal,\u201d India built a billion-user ID network bigger than Twitter and giant solar power plants that are cheaper than coal.That\u2019s what you missed \u2014 and that\u2019s just one country. Are you tired of winning yet?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rev-Up: Imagining a 20% Self-Driving World", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "Call it 20 percent: the day, if it ever arrives, that one out of five vehicles you encounter will be driving itself. In some ways, the 20 percent era is harder to imagine than the fully automated era, because this supposedly unstoppable and frictionless technology will still be embroiled in a total mess. The best, safest models will most likely come with the highest price tags, out of reach for those with average incomes. Coexistence between human and robot drivers will be uneasy at best; road rage against the machine will boil over. One catastrophic accident could still imperil the whole experiment, no matter what the overall statistics show.But that inevitable mess is precisely what makes the one-in-five future so interesting to ponder. It\u2019s the first point, give or take, when it will be clear that a true self-driving future is even possible. When car companies will actually be able to rip out the steering wheels from some models, designing them in entirely different ways. When big trucking firms and car services like Uber will have begun to remove drivers from their vehicles. When hypercommuters will trust their cars to drive them three hours to the office while they sleep. When you might risk putting your child in one, alone.The autonomous vehicle went from test-track prototype to showroom reality far faster than I envisioned, propelled as much by advances in sensors and A.I. as by a collective hype cycle that seemed intent on willing these devices into existence, whether society was ready for them or not. Sitting with that \u201cbeginner\u201d driver in 2008, as engineers closely observed its movements, took me back to that life-defining moment of getting a driver\u2019s license. In my wallet, sparse with a library card and a school-lunch ticket, the license had real heft. It represented a primordial entry point to adulthood, a vast expansion of social possibility.As a rite, the driver\u2019s exam \u2014 I have failed it in two countries \u2014 is a ritual by turns (three-point, of course!) tedious and terrifying. If you can summon nothing else of the 1988 teen comedy \u201cLicense to Drive,\u201d you can still see James Avery\u2019s gleefully malevolent D.M.V. examiner, wielding his famous coffee cup. Once autonomous technology begins to really take off, will the driver\u2019s license, and the pedagogy behind it, go the way of the stick shift? Will the ability to drive begin to seem some exotic, rarely necessary skill \u2014 like starting a fire with a flint?After all, in a vehicle that meets the Level 5 automation criteria of SAE International \u2014 \u201cfull-time performance by an Automated Driving System for all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions\u201d \u2014 there would seem to be little point in possessing this vestigial skill. We don\u2019t require people entering elevators, riding in airport trams or letting Roombas loose upon their living rooms to be able to take over operation in case of machine failure; it\u2019s hard to see why our interaction with this automated technology should be any different. Our learning process could be as quick and dirty as it is with other high-tech products: Toss out the instruction manual and watch someone do it on YouTube.But this possibility, driver made passenger, broaches new territory in jurisprudence. With no licenses, what is the legal basis for restricting anyone \u2014 tweens, the elderly \u2014 from being ferried about? Young farm kids\u2019 driving the family truck seems as obsolete as tail fins, but what\u2019s stopping kids from being driven? Could children, often more adept at handling the smartphones of their parents than their owners are, have an advantage on older drivers less accustomed to technology? Yet the same fears that keep parents from letting their children walk to school may prevail over the allure of their autonomous vehicle handling the school run. It seems hard to say whether autonomous vehicles would hasten or delay the passage to adulthood.And as drivers interact with semiautonomous vehicles in the long run-up to Level 5, driver education and licensing, far from becoming obsolete, may become more important, argues John D. Lee, a professor of engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cAutomation has a strong tendency to surprise people with unexpected behavior,\u201d he says. Knowing what your car is doing \u2014 and when to take over \u2014 could be more vital than merely knowing how to drive. That water on the road \u2014 is it a surface puddle, or a veritable lake filling a gigantic pothole? That truck ahead with the dangerously swaying load \u2014 do you speed up to pass it? Is the pedestrian by the marked crosswalk waiting for you to yield or simply checking his iPhone? \u201cDriving and managing the automation that is helping you drive,\u201d Lee says, \u201care two quite different skill sets. Automation-management skills need to be learned as much as driving skills.\u201dTom Vanderbilt is the author of \u201cYou May Also Like\u201d and \u201cTraffic.\u201dDriverless cars will sometimes need to move around the city with no humans in them at all \u2014 en route to pickups or drop-offs. As empty moving vehicles become a common sight, they\u2019re sure to enable an annoying off-label use: a flowering youth subculture of external joy riding, similar to subway surfing.All over the country, bored teenagers will lurk on the roadside, waiting to leap onto the roofs of empty cars, hanging on for as long as they can. The surfers will take advantage of advances in cloaking technology to help them confuse the cars\u2019 sensors. Some will develop a clever assortment of grips and attachments to help them stay on, although the best among them will sneer at those who need to use tools. Fatalities will be inevitable, and often gruesome.To keep the kids off, car owners will try to coat their cars in slick repellents; these will be effective but too messy to be practical. Soon, dealers of autonomous cars will offer optional rows of spikes similar to those we already use to keep homeless people off benches. Once again, design will become more hostile in the name of safety.Rollo Romig is a journalist based in New York.Liberated from having to watch the road, commuters\u2019 eyes will be free to \u2014 what else? \u2014 consume video content. Sound\u2019s hold on drive time \u2014 first with terrestrial radio, then satellite radio, then podcasts \u2014 will gave way to sight. But what kind of videos will we watch? If Marchetti\u2019s constant holds (this is the idea that as transportation technology and urban planning change, people contort their lives to keep their commutes to an average of one hour per day), they will be not feature films but TV shows and short videos of the kind being increasingly produced for Facebook and YouTube. Podcasts will be displaced by vodcasts. Media companies are already negotiating with carmakers about how to price their offerings. Should in-car entertainment work more like cable or like the on-demand system in a hotel? Like Netflix or like Roku?Most riders who play games will use their phones. But by the time one in five cars is autonomous, console makers will develop specific products for it. The nearly two hours a day of console gaming played by some 60 million Americans will tick up accordingly. Swarms of commuters hitting the morning and evening roads in waves will become swarms of druids or mercenaries in massively multiplayer online games, some of which might come to incorporate the driving experience itself, a Pok\u00e9mon Go for the highway.It seems less likely that we\u2019ll use this opportunity to steal time back from screens. But if there\u2019s enough space for a table, maybe commuters will sit around it playing poker or telling stories. Cars are, indeed, the most private places we have, sealed shut, out of earshot. (The writer Nicholson Baker has said that he likes to write while in a car parked in a shady spot.)Chris Anderson \u2014 formerly the editor of Wired, now the head of a drone-data company and, in his spare time, of a racing league for autonomous cars \u2014 says the question of what we\u2019ll do inside self-driving cars always comes up at cocktail parties. It always confounds him. \u201cWe have this world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s called the back seat of an Uber.\u201d We already know what passengers do in back seats, be they in a limo or an R.V. or a tour bus: They pull out their phones or their iPads, or they talk to one another, or they take a nap. Why should we think that not having a driver will change anything?In an essay for Real Life magazine titled \u201cPerpetual Motion Machines,\u201d Chenoe Hart argues that we miss something when we think of autonomous cars this way, as a difference in degree, not in kind. Because we won\u2019t have to worry about driving, vehicle interiors can expand to a point where we\u2019 stop thinking of them as vehicles: They might have fully functional kitchens, or gyms, or beds. Instead of going to the coffee shop, the coffee shop might come to you; instead of going into the garage to pull out your car, the garage will be the car. The ability to summon spaces like this, Hart writes, will turn the built environment into a kind of random-access memory \u2014 with every destination equally accessible from anywhere. Whether it drove to you or you to it will be irrelevant; motion will be so smooth and constant as to be imperceptible. Hart argues that when travel becomes fully autonomous, we will always be traveling: families or co-workers in quiet concert on giant roads, moving in a cluster of moving buildings, chasing good weather, hardly aware that we\u2019re going anywhere at all.James Somers is a writer and programmer based in New York.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.It\u2019s not as straightforward as it sounds. For one thing, the vehicles would not be freed from the laws of physics. Should your car abruptly brake while you were, for example, running on a treadmill, the treadmill would cease moving forward \u2014 but you wouldn\u2019t, at least until you hit a windshield or door.It might be easier to remain seated. \u201cThe car could have special pockets all over the place that hold resistance bands of different strengths,\u201d says Bryant Johnson, a personal trainer and the author of \u201cThe Ruth Bader Ginsburg Workout.\u201d \u201cYou could use those to get a full-body strength-training workout.\u201dThroughout your commute, your future car could scrutinize your efforts, says Steve McCauley, the head of health services for the Wynn Las Vegas resort, with fingertip monitors or other sensors tracking your heart rate and the composition of your sweat.But realistically, many of us will use our salvaged commuting time otherwise. In tomorrow\u2019s cars, the area beneath the hood may not be needed for a combustion engine, Vujicic says \u2014 but it will remain, for reasons of mechanical stability and safety. Fitted with some padding and a safety belt, it becomes a napping cave.If self-driving cars start to make up a significant portion of urban traffic, they\u2019re likely to push cities to become more populous and compact, with fewer owned vehicles and more car sharing. The future, that is, would look more like Singapore, one of the world\u2019s densest cities, whose government in recent years has tried to curb car ownership and ease congestion problems. We reached out to Limin Hee, the director of research at Singapore\u2019s Center for Livable Cities, to ask her about how she thinks autonomous cars will begin to change urban life.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.These exploits, though dramatic, took advantage of the same vulnerabilities in cellular networks that might plague any tablet or smart vacuum cleaner. But a future in which one in five vehicles is autonomous will not only increase the attack \u201csurface\u201d (in the metaphor favored by researchers) of the car; it will also force manufacturers to confront more insidious security risks that are only now coming into view. It will become possible to compromise vehicles by hacking the environment.A car that drives itself uses sensors to construct high-resolution images of its surroundings, then runs them through a \u201cclassifier\u201d to identify all the objects in the image. The classifier can do this because it has trained on labeled images; after seeing a hundred thousand trucks, it learns to recognize certain features as indicating truck-ness. Today\u2019s most popular and effective classifiers for object recognition, used widely in self-driving car software, are called deep neural networks.But a deep neural network offers researchers very little understanding of why objects become classified as they do. Think of its output as a map, with each classification corresponding, like a ZIP code, to some demarcated region. Instead of existing in just two dimensions, though, the map has more like a thousand dimensions \u2014 and the slightest move in any one of these dimensions can push us into a different ZIP code and produce a false classification. This makes it possible for a hacker to construct slightly perturbed images, called \u201cadversarial examples,\u201d that look innocuous to the human eye but fool the car\u2019s brain into making the wrong call, with potentially fatal consequences.Adversarial examples are extremely difficult to defend against. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand these attacks,\u201d says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut the deeper question is that we don\u2019t understand deep neural networks.\u201d In a recent paper, Song and her co-authors introduced a method of constructing robust adversarial examples that can even be printed on paper and pasted to road signs. A stop sign defaced with specially calibrated graffiti, for instance, is recognized as a 45 m.p.h. speed-limit sign.Song\u2019s warning extends beyond road infrastructure. While researchers for decades have been working on \u2014 and developing countermeasures for \u2014 software vulnerabilities, the study of security issues related to deep learning is still in its infancy. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a precise mathematical definition of a pedestrian,\u201d Song says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for us to write down a formula describing exactly what a pedestrian is. So we can\u2019t even really define our security goals.\u201d Even with a recent surge of interest in adversarial examples, researchers are still struggling to understand the scope of the problem. Given the physical-world ramifications, Song says, \u201cwe should have started even sooner.\u201dYiren Lu is a writer and software engineer in New York.The trickiest part of the transition to a self-driving future may be figuring out liability when accidents do happen. Instead of quarreling only about which driver was at fault, we will also be able to argue about whether the self-driving features in either car may have played a role. A preview of these complications was evident in the aftermath of the crash that killed Joshua Brown, the Ohio man whose autopiloted Tesla ran into a tractor-trailer. Federal investigators determined that the accident was not caused by a defect in the autopilot software, and Tesla has said repeatedly that drivers should always have their hands on the wheel even when they are using the technology. But officials noted that Tesla\u2019s technology was unable to detect cross-traffic like that presented by the tractor-trailer. Tesla subsequently updated its software to make similar accidents less likely in the future.So who was responsible for covering the damages? The insurance policy that covered Brown, who may not have fully understood the capabilities of his car, or Tesla? Neither Tesla nor Brown\u2019s family has commented on who paid. And both car insurers and insurance regulators have been relatively slow to contend with the difficulty in assigning liability when a person is driving a car only part of the time. \u201cInsurance policies have not necessarily caught up with the global advancement of A.I. technology in cars,\u201d Brown\u2019s lawyer told me.Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley, which is racing to raise the curtain on the era of autonomous vehicles, is also thinking about insurance. A start-up called Driav intends to bring down insurance rates by monitoring the reams of data coming out of self-driving cars in order to figure out, on a second-to-second basis, who or what caused the errors that led to a crash. \u201cIt\u2019s silly that claims are a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 argument,\u201d Dan Peate, Driav\u2019s chief executive, told me. \u201cThe data can just tell us what happened.\u201d The company hopes to begin offering insurance policies next year, with the expectation that they will be cheaper in part because the cars will be in fewer accidents and in part because it plans to be able to shift some liability onto the carmakers.In the long run, when all vehicles are driving themselves, the manufacturers themselves are very likely to assume all of the blame for accidents. Most such companies have said that they plan to pay for anything that happens while their cars and software are in charge. When that\u2019s the case, insurance begins to look a lot more like a product warranty, covered by the carmaker, than a stand-alone product that a customer has to worry about. But in the transition years until then, there are likely to be a lot more messy arguments.Nathaniel Popper is a technology reporter for The Times.When I think about the future these days, I inevitably return to a tweet from the writer Elizabeth Hamilton-Argyropoulos (a.k.a. @bourgeoisalien): \u201cThe saddest part about self-driving cars will be all the times people die mid-trip and then ur dinner guests or pizza guy will arrive dead.\u201d To read this joke is to become immediately certain that this will absolutely happen \u2014 of course it will! \u2014 and that it will furthermore become as much a part of the texture of everyday future life as, say, traffic delays caused by collisions are now. Admittedly, the dead-pizza-guy notion doesn\u2019t seem very likely: A large part of the impetus behind the development of self-driving technology in the first place is the desire to do away with the need for flesh-and-blood people who demand wages for their work. But the image feels symbolically resonant precisely because of the ghostly future of all those moribund jobs. Self-driving cars bearing the earthly remains of the recently deceased \u2014 automated Ubers, say, with heart-attack victims sprawled incredulously across the rear seat \u2014 are, in this sense, an extreme metaphor for the near future of capitalism. The technology will be miraculous, yes; but if it functions as intended, it will serve as an uncanny vector of human obsolescence.Mark O\u2019Connell is a writer based in Dublin.\u201cRide-sharing\u201d was always a misnomer for companies like Uber and Lyft. As with the rest of the \u201csharing economy,\u201d nothing was ever being shared; labor and services were being bought and sold. But as ride-share companies have grown, their ambitions have multiplied and compounded. Currently, their horizons are limited by widespread car ownership, alternative transit options and, primarily, their own cost. But autonomous cars make their grander plans \u2014 dreams of vast fleets of perfectly allocated and used vehicles \u2014 more plausible. They zero out a single variable, the cost of labor, that these companies believe is holding them back from utterly reshaping the world. Ride-share businesses are uniquely poised to manifest and demonstrate the big ideas of self-driving cars. They aren\u2019t waiting for this change; they\u2019re doing everything in their power to hasten it. Autonomous cars aren\u2019t just part of the plan; they are the plan.Conservative estimates put the world\u2019s Ubers and Lyfts in an enviable position as self-driving cars roll out. Bullish projections put them in an unassailable one. A 2017 report by Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest, told the story in four numbers. A rider\u2019s \u201call-in cost per mile\u201d for average United States taxi services was about $3.50. For a human-driven Uber in San Francisco, that number was about $2.86. Assuming the same fuel price, the figure for personal cars is much lower, at around 70 cents. The estimate for self-driving taxi services, circa 2020, would cut that cost in half.At 35 cents per mile, tasks that were previously too expensive or that would have felt ridiculous become reasonable and routine. A world in which moving yourself or moving things to you costs almost nothing in terms of money or attention would remake places and transform lives. It would also bring with it new and complicated absurdities \u2014 the sort Americans adapt to quickly and then forget. (Like bottles of water shipped around the world and sold for $2, or electronics products assembled in one country from parts from six others, to be shipped to a seventh.)Riders will thrill to this new infrastructure as it incorporates the roads around them, providing novel experiences and conveniences. But this excitement will prevent us from seeing that our aspiring fleet managers hope to create something like the profound consolidation of the internet\u2019s recent past. Just as Amazon the online store laid the groundwork for Amazon the comprehensive and omnipresent service, apps for human-driven taxis may have laid the groundwork for a thrumming on-demand grid, on which people and things can be placed and retrieved.Like Google and Facebook before them, which remapped, rerouted and dominated the old and diverse web infrastructure on which they were built, Uber and Lyft could say, credibly, that they work better with size and full participation. That market domination is merely the flip side of completeness. They will aspire to monopoly and could achieve, with startling speed, real and unprecedented claims over the roads we share \u2014 they will say they\u2019ve found a better use for them, and if all goes to plan, riders will agree.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The Times.Unless you\u2019re a millionaire or a truck driver, your first encounter with a self-driving vehicle will probably be a car you ordered through a ride-hailing app like Lyft or Uber. These companies, which spent the first stage of their lives trying to get drivers into their cars, are spending the next one trying to get them out. There will be some initial awkwardness around self-driving vehicles, just as there was around ride-hailing in the first place. (Remember when it was weird to get into a stranger\u2019s unmarked car?)But Lyft, for one, is betting that it can put a trustable face on the tech. In July, it announced Level 5, a lab where it will work on its own driverless software, in addition to developing an open self-driving network that companies like Ford and Jaguar Land Rover will be able to plug their vehicles into. The idea of the network is to combine multiple kinds of autonomous vehicles under one routing-and-request system, so that when you order a Lyft, the app will assess your route, check the weather and other factors and send you the best ride, whether that\u2019s an autonomous Waymo or a human-driven S.U.V. John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s co-founder and president, explained its thinking.Kevin Roose is a business columnist for The Times and a writer at large for the magazine.For reasons that have gone unstudied, humans become horny in transit. With the proliferation of subway systems came the proliferation of subway gropers. With commercial air travel came the \u201cMile High Club.\u201d Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee filmed their famous sex tape on a boat (I\u2019m told). There\u2019s something about transportation that gets people in the mood. What is it?My theory is simple. In our capacity as humans, we have three speeds at which we operate: crawl, walk and run. In other words: extremely slow, slow and slightly less slow. When we engage with equipment that increases our velocity, we become excited. This excitement applies in all cases, whether we\u2019re talking about an escalator, a moving walkway, a bicycle, a roller coaster, a golf cart or a Chrysler LeBaron. It is fundamentally thrilling to travel at an unexpected speed. When the enabling mode of transportation is one that permits our excitement to be processed as erotic energy \u2014 even if that processing is specifically legislated against \u2014 some of us will do that. The distance between \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cstimulated\u201d is, after all, incredibly short. If there were a way to have sex on a bicycle, people would be bike-sexing all the time. It would have its own verb.Having sex in a car is not currently impossible, but it is difficult. Hand-eye coordination, a mechanism critical for sex-having, is compromised for the driver, whose hands must remain on the wheel and eyes on the road. In road couplings, the driver is not an equal contributor. Unless, of course, the driver doesn\u2019t need to drive at all. Which brings us to the self-driving car: basically a motel room on wheels. The one hindrance to this development is existing public-lewdness laws, which are fairly expansive. You can\u2019t intentionally get naked and perform a \u201clewd act\u201d in a public place without risk of penalty. Obviously. But you also run a risk if you perform your lewd act in a private place with the intention of being watched \u2014 say, in a self-driven automobile slowly cruising past a school bus where my future grandchildren are watching in horror as a frenzied orgy unfolds within smelling distance. I am confident, however, that the law will be updated to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable car-based encounters.And if not, industrial designers can come up with clever \u201csolves,\u201d the word that start-ups use for some reason instead of \u201csolutions.\u201d If car windows no longer need to function as navigating aids, why not tint them to inky obscurity? Or replace them with mirrors facing outward? Or mirrors facing inward? Or remove them entirely? Future riders may not even need a human partner in order to have an intimate appointment. Nissan is working with Microsoft to develop an \u201cin-vehicle virtual personal assistant\u201d which, if deviously hacked, could provide the 21st-century equivalent of phone sex.More interesting than the aesthetics of car sex will be the cultural consequences. New slang terms will arise. New positions. New trophies. (How many times can you have sex in the time it takes to drive from Las Vegas to Los Angeles?) Virginities will be lost, children conceived, marriage vows consummated and violated. Car-based kinks will be minted and postcoital rituals established. New professional opportunities will emerge: interior decorators who specialize in \u201cself-driving bedrooms\u201d; entrepreneurs who launch apps to enable no-strings-attached in-car assignations. Preferences will be identified and explored. The world will expand in narrow but pulse-quickening ways \u2014 not a sexual revolution, but a plot twist.Molly Young is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Elon Musk is coming for them.\u2022 Stitch Fix is the only tech company led by a woman to go public this year.\u2022 21st Century Fox is courting several interested buyers. But the Justice Department may not let a big media marriage happen. That is one of the many debated questions. Proponents of the Republicans\u2019 plans argue that companies will invest the money. Opponents counter that firms will return the cash to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends.\u201cWhen all variables are measured properly, it seems major companies are paying out to shareholders about 22 percent of their net income. It\u2019s therefore unlikely that new profit, as might follow from lower corporate tax rates, will simply be drained out of the corporation.\u201cMore generally, sending money back to investors doesn\u2019t have to mean no new investment. What if those investors take the money and put it in a venture capital fund or invest it in some other manner? The whole point of capital markets is to recycle resources into the most profitable new opportunities, and that may or may not involve the companies that initially earned those profits.\u201dWith 95 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported third-quarter results, earnings are on pace to grow 6.2 percent from a year earlier, according to FactSet. That\u2019s up from the 3.1 percent growth rate expected at the end of period.Technology companies drove much of the growth. The sector reported a 19.7 percent increase in earnings and was the biggest contributor to earnings growth rate. If the tech sector was excluded, the overall growth rate would fall to 2.8 percent from 6.2 percent.Here are some more takeaways from earnings season:\u2022 Profits at companies that generate more that 50 percent of their sales outside the United States, grew more than 13 percent in the third quarter. Earnings at firms that get a majority of their revenue from within the U.S., rose only 2.3 percent.That is a reversal of what many analysts expected at the beginning of 2017. A stronger American dollar, a pickup in the United State\u2019s economy, and the Trump administration\u2019s policies were expected to benefit companies with the greatest exposure to United States were expected to benefit more from the Trump administration\u2019s policies, and a stronger dollar. But the United States dollar remained weaker.\u2022 The energy sector reported the largest increase in earnings of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors at 135 percent. The increase is a reflection of how hard the roughly two year slide in oil prices had hit the industry.\u2022 74 percent of companies have reported profits above analysts expectations, above the five-year average of 69 percent.\u2022 Financial firms reported the biggest decline in profits, down 8.3 percent. That decline can largely be blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Insurance companies in the sector reported 63 percent decrease in profits.\u2022 90 percent of the companies in the S&P 500\u2019s technology sector exceeded analyst estimates.\u2014 Stephen GrocerA traditional diesel truck can be operated for $1.51 a mile; the Tesla Semi, he said, beats that with $1.26.But it gets better.

The company kept its valuation relatively low, and it has generated a profit two years in a row.In fact, only 4.2 percent of all I.P.O.s in the United States were led by woman from 2000 to 2015. That compares to 6.4 percent of Fortune 500 companies run by a woman.The reasons are well known: The internet and newer players like Netflix have upended the media and telecom landscapes. Size and scale seem more important than ever. It\u2019s the premise of the AT&T and Time Warner deal, which itself echoes Comcast buying NBCUniversal.More in media consolidationAcross the industry, digital-media companies are finding that lines of business that caught fire for them early on \u2014 like creating custom content for brands \u2014 are becoming harder to scale up. Meanwhile, with each passing year, Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. are tightening their grip on the online-ad market.Extra creditThe leak of 210,000 gallons in South Dakota came days before the Public Services Commission of Nebraska is to vote on a permit for the pipeline\u2019s bigger sibling, Keystone XL.After his election, President Trump issued an executive order to clear obstacles for the Keystone XL, but TransCanada still needed a permit from the independent, five-person Nebraska PSC. Concerns there have revolved around potential harm to the state\u2019s ecologically delicate Sandhills region and its vast Ogallala aquifer, prompting TransCanada to move the Nebraska segment further east.What else have people found in the tax overhaul?The goal is to hit the ground running in overhauling an agency that some Republicans have called corrupt and that GOP lawmakers widely blame for burdening lenders with unnecessary red tape. It could be months before Trump nominates a permanent C.F.P.B. director and the Senate confirms his selection.The $1 trillion investor is talking about selling all of its holdings in oil companies. That\u2019s likely to give the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, which is working on an I.P.O., some heartburn.\u201cThe Norwegian view is that oil has had a good run and will have a good run for a couple of decades but it\u2019s not the only future that is out there.\u201dChina knows that, as demand for oil declines in much of the developed world, ever more of Aramco\u2019s barrels must flow east anyway. So the idea it will buy a big slug of Aramco at anything more than a discounted price \u2014 without some sort of sweetener in terms of a low-priced oil supply contract anyway \u2014 is a stretch.It\u2019s made by Tesla, of course.

{"Headline": "Full Tilt: When 100% of Cars Are Autonomous", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "Urban-transportation experts have been busily creating computer simulations to show how this might work. In one model, each crossroads would have an \u201cintersection manager,\u201d a computer that senses the approaching traffic and uses wireless communication to talk to the oncoming cars. When each self-driving car is perhaps 300 yards away, it sends a request to the intersection manager \u2014 to turn right, say, or to move on through. The intersection manager then does an on-the-fly calculation to route that vehicle most efficiently, like an omnipotent and tireless traffic cop.The result? A ballet of cars whizzing and weaving past one another in the intersection. Some slow down as they approach; others pass straight through. But crucially, compared with today\u2019s intersections, many fewer cars come to a complete halt.This could significantly speed up traffic throughout an entire city. Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who works with one model, has found that the \u201cdelay\u201d time at intersections shrinks remarkably. \u201cRight now, it takes me an average of 20 minutes to get to work, but with autonomous-car intersections, it might be half that time,\u201d he says. Safety would be enhanced, too: Forty-three percent of car crashes in the United States occur at intersections, and Stone predicts that robot vehicles would crash only if there was a mechanical error. Better yet, autonomous intersections could produce an estimated 20 to 50 percent less carbon dioxide, because there would be fewer idling cars and jack-rabbit starts. \u201cThat\u2019s the most expensive and most polluting part of driving,\u201d says Remi Tachet des Combes, a mathematician who created robot-intersection models while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.For the human passenger, though, a robotized intersection could be mildly terrifying \u2014 like flying through a crowded asteroid belt, trusting the A.I. to find the right path. \u201cAt first I think it will be freaky,\u201d Stone admits. \u201cSome people will need the window darkened so they don\u2019t freak out.\u201d But in the long run, we\u2019ll probably shrug, get used to it and barely look up from our games of Candy Crush as we zip through. And pedestrians? They would probably push a button at the intersection to request their turn \u2014 or even use a smartphone app.More subtly unsettling, however, might be the spectacle of a city devoid of stoplights. Indeed, devoid of all major street signs: no huge billboards across highways naming the exits, no complex merge instructions. Those signs are expensive to build and maintain. They\u2019re designed for humans, and GPS-brained robots don\u2019t need them to know where they\u2019re going. Certainly, human pedestrians and cyclists will still need guideposts, but as Stone suspects, far fewer, and smaller, ones.A world with almost no street signs would feel strange. It could make a city less cluttered and more attractive. But it might also leave us feeling unmoored. Social critics worry that GPS has already eroded our knowledge of the city; some studies have found that the more we rely on devices, the less we deeply intuit where we are and how to navigate on our own. \u201cWe become more helpless,\u201d as Greg Milner, the author of \u201cPinpoint,\u201d a history of GPS, told me. If robots rule the roads, we might get where we\u2019re going a lot more quickly \u2014 but end up not knowing precisely where we are.Clive Thompson is the author of \u201cSmarter Than You Think: How Technology Is Changing Our Minds for the Better.\u201dDeveloped by Marshall Brown, Lili Du, Laura Forlano, Jack Guthman, and Ron Henderson. Visual Design by Maryam HeidaripourBrown is a creator of the Driverless City Project, an interdisciplinary research initiative at I.I.T. that takes a playful, rigorous approach to envisioning the fully autonomous future. The project helps participants generate various situations for a city in order to determine how autonomous cars will fit into the picture. Central to the project is a \u201cmind map\u201d representing the group\u2019s research, organized into four areas of impact: street space, parking space, commuter space and delivery space. The map, as well as other tools \u2014 including a set of large tokens for scenario building, like a tarot deck for urbanists \u2014 is meant to encourage others to be ambitious and creative about the world in which they want to live. \u201cWe should write the future,\u201d Brown says, \u201crather than trying to predict it.\u201dBrown has found two prevalent attitudes when it comes to self-driving vehicles: either an active but unimaginative approach, rushing to build robots to accommodate the world as it is now, or a totally passive approach, a sort of \u201cwait and see.\u201d The first, he says, is characteristic of the tech industry; the second, of the public sector. \u201cI hear too much surrendering in the question about our future right now,\u201d he adds. \u201cJust surrendering to Google or Amazon, or surrendering to your phone, or surrendering to a driverless car. We should not surrender.\u201dOne way to stave off surrender, Brown believes, is to invite more diverse thinkers, like architects and urban planners, into the process of imagining and designing the autonomous future. (He also listed sociologists, fiction writers, Buddhist monks, poets and rabbis as useful stakeholders.) The current discourse around the future of autonomous vehicles is centered on \u201ctechnologically deterministic fantasies,\u201d Brown says. He\u2019s concerned that technological values \u2014 like logic, predictability and efficiency \u2014 will be erroneously imposed upon the built environment, leading to urban spaces that fail to take into account delight, pleasure or human connection. \u201cA society is cultural, and political, and aesthetic, and about desires \u2014 it\u2019s not just how you solve problems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to need more than just software engineers working on it.\u201dAs an architect, Brown is especially attuned to the unlocked aesthetic potential of urban environments. Today\u2019s visual clutter, necessary for keeping human-driven cars as nonlethal as possible, could be eradicated. It is critical, in his view, to consider the beauty and quality of the world that self-driving cars could bring.It\u2019s worth considering, then, where cars will go when people don\u2019t need them. \u201cWhat happens when a car can park itself anywhere?\u201d Brown asks. He hypothesizes that parking, if performed robotically, could become \u201ca negative externality, not unlike that of a trash dump,\u201d should developers repurpose garages and parking lots for more lucrative uses. (Why look for parking in Greenwich Village if the car can park itself on the edge of New Jersey?) In the Midwest, he speculates, deindustrialized cities with waning property values could even be bought wholesale and transformed into vast, flat parking lots \u2014 a future that he deemed plausible, if \u201ctoo dystopian,\u201d in no small part because of the likelihood that it would be pushed upon lower-income communities. On the other hand, those same communities could benefit from increased mobility and access to employment.Brown is also considering the changes to storage: If robotic trucks constantly roam our landscape, will warehouses be abandoned? He\u2019s focused on the changing needs and desires of a human driver. To accommodate an autonomous, cross-country route, truck cabs, he speculates, may need to expand according to a driver\u2019s needs, perhaps going so far as to resemble a microapartment.An emphasis (or lack thereof) on efficiency also addresses the temporal dimension of cities: It favors \u2014 or facilitates \u2014 a working lifestyle in which there is never enough time. In a future of increased automation and accessibility, work culture may begin to shift; labor, and its attendant time constraints, may no longer be central to the urban experience. Brown envisions the possibility of a hands-free commute that opens up space for socializing \u2014 \u201can interior social world.\u201d Riders could chat with people in adjacent cars or simply take the opportunity to watch the world go by. (A more cynical take on this, he says, is that the hands-free commute will simply increase the demands on workers, as the car becomes an extension of the home office \u2014 a WeWork on wheels.)Second-order effects of autonomous vehicles tend to get lost in the techno-utopian chatter, but there seems to be an increasing awareness that self-driving cars won\u2019t just arrive in cities; they\u2019ll change them too. Some tech companies are beginning to get into data-driven city-building, a movement largely galvanized by the seeming inevitability of autonomous vehicles. Last year, Y Combinator announced a research initiative, New Cities, that aimed to study how to build a metropolis entirely from scratch. In mid-October, Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet subsidiary, announced that it will redevelop a 12-acre strip along Toronto\u2019s waterfront, called Quayside, which will integrate technology across the human experience. The vehicles it is planning to accommodate will be shared, electric and self-driving.Power and control over autonomous-vehicle technology is already concentrated in the hands of a small few: If a company like Uber or Alphabet controls the dominant transportation infrastructure, you need not live in an intentional community like Quayside to feel as though your city is becoming a company town. Brown is wary of the smart-cities initiative, and he resents the efforts of technology companies to fully saturate the human \u2014 and urban \u2014 experience. \u201cA city is not a problem to be solved,\u201d he says. \u201cA city is a cultural construct, even though it involves the deployment of technologies. A city is not science alone.\u201dAnna Wiener is a writer based in San Francisco.Tomorrow\u2019s could. Unlike Google Glass \u2014 which awkwardly placed screens where they didn\u2019t need to be \u2014 a car already requires a membrane between passengers and their environment. Why not turn that typically passive barrier into a dynamic canvas? Ordinary windows could be replaced with holographic glass or an advanced semitranslucent liquid-crystal display. They could anticipate our needs and instantaneously display weather forecasts, reviews of nearby restaurants and hotels, details about popular tourist attractions \u2014 and warnings about miserable tourist traps.As the technology improves and people become more comfortable obscuring their surroundings, your windows could begin to overlay a vast digital diorama onto passing scenery. Passengers would no longer have to wonder about the identity of a landmark and scramble to look it up on their phones. Instead, the car itself, wired with artificial intelligence, plugged into sophisticated mapping technology and equipped with magic eyes, would instantaneously recognize, annotate and augment its surroundings. A mountain, desert or coastline could become an interactive infographic, peeling away the physical surface of the earth to reveal hidden layers of geology. A self-directed double-decker bus ambling through London could rearrange the city like a Lego set, refashioning streets and buildings to illuminate the capital\u2019s rich history. Early television sets made the distant accessible; the self-driving car could reveal the invisible in the immediate.As exciting as such possibilities are, recent history suggests plenty of reasons to temper our optimism. When windows double as screens, we will have the opportunity to gaze at the world anew through richly animated portals. Alternatively \u2014 and perhaps more realistically \u2014 we could end up staring into larger versions of our phones, distracting ourselves with email, mindless games and the infinite bazaar of the internet. The potential of the autonomous vehicle is to help us interact with our environment in ways never before possible. The temptation is to turn ever more inward, exchanging the physical world for yet another simulation.Either way, self-driving cars with ubiquitous screens will inevitably bring all the familiar drawbacks of digital media onto the open road. Taxi TV in New York City is just a preview of the potential nightmare. What if the price for enchanted windows of the future is a nauseating kaleidoscope of advertisements, vapid movie reviews and contextless late-night jokes? Rather than learning about the hidden history of your surroundings, you may very well learn only about two-for-one cricket tacos in the food truck a lane over, homeowner\u2019s insurance for the Anthropocene or the sale on microdrones at a nearby mall. Don\u2019t want ads? No problem. You can upgrade to a premium account.Ferris Jabr is a writer based in Portland, Ore.One big question about the driverless car will be who gets to own our new wealth of free time. Will it remain with commuters \u2014 or will corporations expect them to tap into the office as their vehicles ferry them there? While the potential for hours of unplugged leisure exists, the way we currently fill our downtime leads me to believe that some form of digital immersion will take precedence, as bosses expect employees to work on their way to and from work. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the remaining minimum-wage positions in the rapidly automating food industry go to those who have access to driverless cars; use their cars for deliveries while they work, and you get two employees for the price of one.It\u2019s tricky. On their surface, driverless cars will take some of the mess out of living, but they can also take the living where they don\u2019t want to go, both psychologically and physically. Some car interiors might more closely resemble cubicles. Or cells. Will private employers surveil workers in order to control off-duty behavior? It\u2019s also easy to conceive of a future where newly created infrastructure, explicitly dedicated to automated vehicles, will enable people with the means to own the cars to avoid the people without.We should be wary of any technology that allows those with power to distance themselves even further from society.Rahawa Haile is an Eritrean-American writer of short stories and essays.Autonomous cars will once again transform teenage life. Anab Jain, a founder of the design studio Superflux, says the ritual requirements of teenage socializing will inspire \u201ca new range of acts and services that help you obfuscate your car\u2019s identity or your own data.\u201d Instead of trying to roll back the odometer on the family car \u00e0 la Ferris Bueller, teenagers hoping to roam the city, free from parental view, might trick it into recording destinations they didn\u2019t really visit. \u201cThe whole notion of freedom will change,\u201d Jain says, even as some of the destinations remain familiar. Dark streets or quiet state parks where GPS doesn\u2019t reach would be the coolest sites of all.The question of when, exactly, the party has started will also become an intriguing one: After all, each car is a room unto itself. The Situationist International, a loose group of artists, political agitators and heavy drinkers who roamed the streets of Paris and other cities in the 1960s, treating them as arenas for detours and debauchery, offers some clues about how such rooms could be transformed. \u201cI only ever hear self-driving cars talked about as a functional solution to the problem of getting from A to B,\u201d says McKenzie Wark, the author of a history of the Situationists called \u201cThe Beach Beneath the Street.\u201d (The title is a reference to the sand that was revealed when protesters picked up cobblestones from the Paris streets to throw at the police.) Wark imagines these machines rolling out of the factory with more radical settings hard-wired into their operating systems. \u201cA hybrid of the self-driving car and, say, Grindr could bring a whole new meaning to the concept of cruising,\u201d Wark suggests. \u201cThere should be a \u2018scenic route\u2019 setting, a \u2018random\u2019 setting, a \u2018surprise me\u2019 setting. Or maybe \u2018mystery destination,\u2019 which whisks you \u2014 and algorithmically chosen others \u2014 to an undisclosed location. Algorithmic chicken for teenage drivers, where you drive head-on toward another car \u2014 then magically swerve off at the last minute.\u201dUnlike today\u2019s cars, autonomous cars can also be made to swarm together, creating somewhat of a paradox: a moving traffic jam. Once the swarm is formed, proximity algorithms could mine social-media profiles to arrange like-minded clusters, while enabling \u201cshuffle mode\u201d might one day be the equivalent of texting a friend to rescue you from the boring guy in the corner. Aspiring D.J.s will rely on software to assemble self-driving cars into the ideal configuration for louder bass. Couples armed with GPS jammers \u2014 the future\u2019s perfect Valentine\u2019s Day gift \u2014 will quietly steer strangers away, creating a halo of romantic privacy around their makeout sessions. If all else fails, hit \u201cskip\u201d to be transported to an entirely new party.Hidden beneath the hormone haze of future block parties, new opportunities for cultural pranks and political protest will emerge. Rather than throw cobblestones, protesters could quickly jam the streets to show political solidarity or organize a strike. With the right programming skills, they might be able to shut down a whole city just by blocking a few crucial nodes. They could even open the streets back up to foot traffic, remaking them as a space for celebration. Then, of course, when it\u2019s time to go home, all those dull factory presets, optimized for safety and efficiency, will finally come into their own \u2014 no designated driver necessary.Geoff Manaugh is the author of \u201cA Burglar\u2019s Guide to the City.\u201dIn the self-driving future, a weed transaction will begin the same as always \u2014 by texting your dealer in search of \u201ctree,\u201d or by casually asking if he wants to \u201chang out.\u201d En route to another customer\u2019s house, he will text back immediately, freed from the imposition of two hands on the wheel. Memories of waiting impatiently on a flaky dealer will recede as his car appears on your app, predicting arrival time down to the minute. Watch as his vehicle weaves around school zones, or is maybe flagged and pulled over by the police. The new possibilities for surveillance are endless.In any case, if he makes it to your house, it is likely that he will emerge from his self-driving pod in a sweatshirt for a company with a name like T\u014dkTaxi or Gangl.ly or Lyft\u2019d. As weed begins to trend toward legality, we\u2019ve already seen such standing-desk branding start to creep into the stoner vernacular. A scan down PC Magazine\u2019s \u201c15 Blazing Hot Weed Tech Companies to Watch\u201d reveals Tokken (a blockchain system for dealers), MassRoots (a stoner social network) and Eaze (the obligatory \u201cUber for weed\u201d). In this new age of cannabis, the only thing that moves faster than the tech is the rate at which smoking itself becomes corny.But cringe-worthy orthography is not the only thing that this self-driven industry will inherit from Silicon Valley. In the age of semiautonomous cars, dealers will be forced to file 1099s, sharing their profits as lowly subcontractors. As in the time when dealers drove themselves, this fleet of buddies-for-hire will offer five to 10 minutes of humanity-affirming chitchat. Unlike preautonomous dealers, they will plead that you tweet their referral codes in order to receive a complimentary edible.This, of course, is one good reason to strive for fully autonomous drugmobiles. The driverless vehicle eliminates small talk, supplying your fix directly from the glove box with a personalized passcode, \u00e0 la Amazon Locker. With no human body attached to the cargo, suppliers will seek to move harder drugs, in bigger quantities, potentially unleashing a new set of problems. The narc, a liability throughout all of human history, isn\u2019t likely to go anywhere soon. Self-driving cars will scan for hazards in the street but will also pickup telltale signs of an informant: nervous twitches, too-enthusiastic slang. A customer might even be asked to answer a question like, \u201cAre you a cop?\u201d (Because, as all drug dealers know, a real cop has to say yes, even to an A.I.) It is likely that a database of narcs will be compiled, and inevitably, this database of narcs will be hacked. Millions of Americans will be exposed as poseurs \u2014 a social problem tragically immune to disruption.Jamie Lauren Keiles is a writer in New York.In the coming world of ubiquitous self-driving, it will just be you, the open road and the vast apparatus of the nanny state. Cars won\u2019t readily violate traffic laws and may well be legally required to report on their owners. Ignore that burned-out headlight for too long, and the overnight software update may include a virtual boot.Traffic tickets bring in billions of dollars annually, so all those well-behaved cars will have an economic impact. Governments that have historically viewed traffic citations as an extractive industry (Ferguson, Mo., say, or the State of California) will have no choice but to find alternatives. Far more consequential, for both the police and their communities, will be the death of the routine traffic stop. The Supreme Court has ruled that law enforcement may stop any car, whatever its true motive, as long as an infraction is observed. Human drivers can\u2019t get far without breaking the letter of the traffic law, so the pretexts come easy. If officers then spot a dozen laptops stacked on the back seat, they can ask questions. Yet this broad, virtually unchecked power to stop has led to charges of racial profiling. (A recent linguistic analysis of bodycam footage from Oakland, Calif., for example, concluded that officers spoke \u201cwith consistently less respect toward black versus white community members.\u201d) With pretexts largely automated away, these kinds of interactions will be rare. \u201cThe self-driving car,\u201d says Elizabeth Joh, a professor at the U.C. Davis School of Law, \u201cwill come to be seen as a civil rights issue.\u201dThe police will have lost an important investigative tool, but the government will have gained new surveillance possibilities. Cars will sweep up vast amounts of data about their surroundings and their occupants, including 24/7 GPS trails. (An important Fourth Amendment case being heard this fall, Carpenter v. United States, will decide whether the government needs a warrant to gain access to cellphone locational data, setting a precedent that could apply to cars.)Another potential target is the pedestrian. In the first part of the 20th century, manufacturers lobbied to make \u201cjaywalking\u201d a crime, so the new horseless carriages could cruise along urban streets relatively unimpeded. The pedestrians of the future, emboldened by the fact that self-driving cars are sure to stop, could cause havoc. No worries, though: Facial-recognition technology is coming along nicely, and the automotive industry will be, if anything, even more powerful. Look for today\u2019s complaints about speeding tickets to be replaced by stories of \u201cjaywalking traps\u201d and pitiless fines for a second offense.Looking back at the decades when the autonomous car was developed, you may find it hard to believe that its engineers imagined that it would stay landbound. All along, sea levels continued to rise, gradually overwhelming the sea walls that many coastal cities built as protection and flooding the (now absurdly named) ground floor of apartment and office buildings.Rather than simply abandon these buildings, though, many residents chose to stay \u2014 fueling a demand for autonomous aquacars and, as that technology improved, for mobile aquahomes. This became especially true after the successful completion of the SeaOrbiter, a floating laboratory originally designed for oceanography research. Elegant and semisubmersible, the SeaOrbiter acted as a kind of prototype for local offshore living \u2014 and the rise of aerial drone delivery, originally pioneered by Amazon, made the challenge of resupplying straightforward.Unfortunately, hackers quickly figured out how to hijack the aquahomes\u2019 navigation system \u2014 first by disabling it and then with programs that directed vessels to floating \u201cchop shops\u201d run by roving gangs of ship-breakers. Piracy rates dropped only after huge kelp growth, driven by a mix of ocean warming and overfishing, rendered the submerged communities as unnavigable by aquacars as they had been by roadbound ones.The animals most imperiled by cars are top predators like the Florida panther. Vehicles are responsible for 59 percent of all known panther deaths recorded in the state since 1981; just last year, a record-breaking 34 panthers \u2014 about one-fourth of the estimated population \u2014 were killed on the state\u2019s roads. Most panthers are struck at night, when human vision is particularly poor, but long-distance infrared cameras can pick up a warmblooded feline body in the dark, far beyond the range of headlights. Panthers able to cross roads safely could spread out of the cramped confines of Florida\u2019s southern tip, move north into the Okefenokee Swamp and then farther into Georgia on their way to eventually repopulating the Southeast.There is a concept in ecology called the trophic cascade, essentially the ripple effect on other animals when a top species vanishes. Over hundreds of years, humans methodically killed off predators like wolves, pumas and grizzly bears. Now, in many places, human drivers have become, albeit unintentionally, the top predator. Every year in the United States, there are an estimated 1.5 million deer-vehicle crashes. If self-driving cars manage to give deer safe passage, the fast-reproducing species would quickly grow beyond the ability of the vegetation to sustain them. \u201cYou\u2019d get a lot of starvation and mass die-offs,\u201d says Daniel J. Smith, a conservation biologist at the University of Central Florida who has been studying road ecology for nearly three decades. Species like raccoons and Virginia opossums will most likely see population explosions. \u201cThere will be deer in people\u2019s yards, and there will be snipers in towns killing them,\u201d Cramer says.This rewilding will be largely accidental, of course. Engineers will program cars to prioritize human life and property, making it far more likely they will stop for a moose than for a sparrow. Just how deferential they are toward wildlife will depend on human choices and ingenuity. For now, the heterogeneity and unpredictability of nature tends to confound the algorithms. In Australia, hopping kangaroos jumbled a self-driving Volvo\u2019s ability to measure distance. In Boston, autonomous-vehicle sensors identified a flock of sea gulls as a single form rather than a collection of individual birds. Still, even the tiniest creatures could benefit. \u201cThe car could know: \u2018O.K., this is a hot spot for frogs. It\u2019s spring. It\u2019s been raining. All the frogs will be moving across the road to find a mate,\u2019\u2009\u201d Smith says. The vehicles could reroute to avoid flattening amphibians on that critical day.But for that to happen, the people making and buying the cars would need to regard them and the roads not just as a mode of transport but also as part of a vast and intricate ecological web. So far, most humans don\u2019t seem particularly inclined to this kind of systems thinking. It is more likely that a surge in animal populations will be just another unintended consequence of a technological shift \u2014 much like social-media sites becoming platforms for publishing fake news or, for that matter, the internal-combustion engine contributing to the suffocation of the planet that might eventually wipe out humans and animals alike. We tend to get caught, ill prepared, in storms of our own making. If one thing seems certain about the autonomous car, it\u2019s that we will go full speed ahead with it, even if we haven\u2019t entirely thought through the consequences.Malia Wollan is the Tip columnist for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Is Said to Plan Repeal of Net Neutrality Rules", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA rollback of net neutrality regulations would represent a significant victory for broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast and would amount to a strike against consumers. When the rules were passed in 2015, they underlined the importance of high-speed internet to the lives of Americans and the need to more strongly regulate the communications service like a utility, as essential as electricity and the telephone.But under a repeal, companies like AT&T and Comcast may be able to charge people higher fees to access certain websites and online services. The companies may also be able to prioritize their own services while disadvantaging websites run by rivals.In addition, Mr. Pai plans to reverse a decision from the Obama administration that declared broadband be treated like a utility, the people said. That classification had opened the door to many more regulations for broadband providers.The F.C.C. did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the repeal plans.Consumer groups and Democrats denounced the proposed changes.\u201cIt ain\u2019t broke, so why fix it?\u201d Julius Genachowski, a former Democratic chairman of the F.C.C., said in an interview. \u201cThe core rules of no blocking, no discrimination, and transparency have worked to create an ecosystem of innovation and investment that\u2019s the envy of the rest of the world.\u201dNet neutrality has long been a thorny topic that has ignited lobbying battles and heated debate between internet and telecom companies. On one side, broadband companies have argued that the regulations encumbered their business plans. On the other side, tech giants like Google and Amazon said that without such rules, the broadband providers could become gatekeepers of what internet content reached consumers.While some of the largest companies can afford to pay for faster delivery of their online content, start-ups like Etsy and Reddit, which have been fierce defenders of net neutrality, have said smaller companies would be squashed by what they view as tolls just to make sure their sites reach consumers.During the Obama administration, the head of the F.C.C., Tom Wheeler, said net neutrality regulations were necessary to prevent a company like Verizon from slowing down the delivery of a service like Netflix or Sling TV, which competes with Verizon\u2019s video service, Fios.Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal to scrap net neutrality rules is the latest in a deregulation blitz that includes the rollback of media ownership and broadband privacy rules. Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump, opposed the rules when they were created in 2015, saying they would stifle investment by broadband providers.More recently, Mr. Pai has clearly signaled his opposition to net neutrality. He has called the rules an example of government overreach in the fast-growing broadband industry. In April, a few months after he was named F.C.C. chairman, he announced his intention to overhaul the rules, saying the threat of harm to consumers was only theoretical.\u201cThe truth of the matter is that we decided to abandon successful policies solely because of hypothetical harms and hysterical prophecies of doom,\u201d Mr. Pai said in an April speech about the creation of the net neutrality rules.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Plans Net Neutrality Repeal in a Victory for Telecoms", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Communications Commission released a plan on Tuesday to dismantle landmark regulations that ensure equal access to the internet, clearing the way for internet service companies to charge users more to see certain content and to curb access to some websites.The proposal, made by the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, is a sweeping repeal of rules put in place by the Obama administration. The rules prohibit high-speed internet service providers, or I.S.P.s, from stopping or slowing down the delivery of websites. They also prevent the companies from charging customers extra fees for high-quality streaming and other services.The announcement set off a fight over free speech and the control of the internet, pitting telecom titans like AT&T and Verizon against internet giants like Google and Amazon. The internet companies warned that rolling back the rules could make the telecom companies powerful gatekeepers to information and entertainment. The telecom companies say that the existing rules prevent them from offering customers a wider selection of services at higher and lower price points.\u201cUnder my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,\u201d Mr. Pai said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that\u2019s best for them.\u201dMr. Pai, a Republican who has pursued an aggressive deregulation agenda, was widely expected to have his plan approved during a meeting on Dec. 14. The two other Republicans on the commission generally vote with Mr. Pai, giving them a majority over the two Democrats.Telecom and internet companies are expected to lobby hard in Washington \u2014 and directly to the public \u2014 as they did when the current rules were adopted.Some internet companies were expected to put up a fight to prevent the proposal from taking hold. The Internet Association, an industry group, joined a legal effort in 2015 to protect the existing rules. The agency has already received 20 million public comments, many of them in opposition of changing the rules, since Mr. Pai announced the broad outlines of his thinking early this year.The big companies that provide internet access to phones and computers have fought for years against broadband regulations. Under the new plan, broadband providers will be able to block access, slow down or speed up service for its business partners in some cases \u2014 as long as they notify customers.\u201cThis action will return broadband in the U.S. to a regulatory regime that emphasizes private investment and innovation over lumbering government intervention,\u201d said Joan Marsh, a vice president at AT&T.\u201cWe are disappointed that the proposal announced today by the F.C.C. fails to maintain the strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Erin Egan, a vice president at Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cWe will work with all stakeholders committed to this principle.\u201dSmall online companies believe the proposal would hurt innovation, because telecom companies could force them to pay more for the faster connections. Only the largest companies, they say, would be able to afford the expense of making sure their sites received preferred treatment. Companies like Etsy and Pinterest, for example, credit their start to the promise of free and open access on the internet.And consumers, the online companies say, may see their costs go up if, for example, they want high-quality access to popular websites like Netflix, a company that depends on fast connections for its streaming videos. Netflix said on Tuesday that it opposed Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal.The action \u201crepresents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Google, Facebook, Amazon and other tech companies.Mr. Pai said the current rules had been adopted to stop only theoretical harm. He said the rules limit consumer choice because telecom companies cannot offer different tiers of service, for example. As a result, he said, internet service companies cannot experiment with new business models that could help them compete with online businesses like Netflix, Google and Facebook.\u201cIt\u2019s depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation,\u201d Mr. Pai said Tuesday.Comcast, one of the country\u2019s biggest broadband companies, said it would not slow websites that contain legally permitted material.\u201cWe do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content \u2014 and we will be transparent with our customers about these policies,\u201d the company said.In a call with reporters, F.C.C. officials said the blocking and slowing of some content could be seen as anticompetitive. Those practices, they said, would be policed by the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department.Mr. Pai, who was appointed chairman by President Trump in January, has eliminated numerous regulations during his first year.The agency has stripped down rules governing television broadcasters, newspapers and telecom companies that were meant to protect the public interest. On Tuesday, in addition to the net neutrality rollback, Mr. Pai announced a plan to eliminate a rule limiting any corporation from controlling broadcasts that can reach more than 39 percent of American homes.The fight over net neutrality could end up being one of his biggest and most fraught decisions. For more than a decade, the agency has struggled with how to regulate internet service, leading to extended legal battles. The rules adopted under Mr. Wheeler were upheld in 2016 by a federal appeals court in Washington.The proposal released on Tuesday will probably make its way to court as well. And companies like Google and Facebook are expected to push the public to speak out against the plan. They coordinated a huge online protest against the possible changes in July.Some of the lobbying could take place in Congress, even though it may change little because Republicans control both houses. Nevertheless, Democrats have vowed to try to reconstruct the strict rules adopted by the F.C.C. in 2015.The next three weeks promise to hold intense lobbying from both sides, but that might not be the end of it. The regulation of internet providers has already swung once on a change in the Oval Office.\u201cAs good as the F.C.C.\u2019s action is for I.S.P.s, it only assures nonregulation of broadband through 2020,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the research firm Cowen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix Originals That Don\u2019t Get to the Theater", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingNetflix\u2019s disinclination to release its original films in theaters has earned the company disapprobation from cinephiles, and caused a brouhaha at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival. There\u2019s a logic to this: The company is a video streaming service, after all. Hardly anybody complains that HBO doesn\u2019t release its films theatrically. The difference has to do with conventional wisdom. Because Netflix is producing significant films by celebrated directors like Bong Joon-ho (this year\u2019s \u201cOkja\u201d) and Martin Scorsese (whose \u201cThe Irishman\u201d will make its Netflix premiere in early 2019), there\u2019s a perceived imperative that they need to be seen on large screens and in the company of a lot of other people.And yet, nobody demanded that \u201cPublic Speaking,\u201d a 2010 documentary about the writer Fran Lebowitz that was 100 percent directed by Martin Scorsese for HBO, get a theatrical run. What can I tell you? There\u2019s a tendency for some to see a film made for television as somehow not a proper film. It takes years to change that perception (see Rainer Werner Fassbinder\u2019s early \u201970s TV movie \u201cWorld on a Wire\u201d or his monumental limited TV series \u201cBerlin Alexanderplatz\u201d).\u201cCreep 2,\u201d produced in part by Netflix, is streaming now on Amazon, Fandango, Google Play and iTunes and is coming to Netflix later this year. Spoiler alert: Since the sequel takes up where the 2014 original, \u201cCreep,\u201d ended, it begins with Mark Duplass playing the same serial killer as before. The hook in both pictures, very appropriate for postmodern microbudget filmmaking, is that this killer attracts his victims by soliciting for videographers on Craigslist. The twist here, if it can be called that, is that Mr. Duplass\u2019s serial killer admits right off to the failed webcaster Sara (Desiree Akhavan) that he\u2019s a murderer. He wants the video he\u2019s commissioned to be his testament. Pairing male serial killer with female videographer might generate some tensions beyond the usual, and indeed, Mr. Duplass\u2019s character gets buck naked in front of Sara\u2019s camera in the first step of what he deems a trust-building exercise. But this movie generates most of its shocks the same way the first one did: via use of a deliberately clunky subjective camera, in front of which Mr. Duplass will periodically jump from behind a door or a corner and scream \u201cBoo!\u201d or some variant thereof. As Orson Welles once said, \u201cunrewarding.\u201dI had higher hopes for \u201c1922,\u201d adapted from a novella by Stephen King that\u2019s unrelentingly grim, even by his standards. It tells the story of a farm-life-fixated dolt who kills his wife rather than sit still for her plan to sell off her land and move to Omaha. Manipulating his teenage son\u2019s resentments, he enlists the boy in the homicide. Things get worse from there, with hallucinations (or are they?) of the walking dead and lots of rats.The film, directed by Zak Hilditch from his own screenplay, is a handsome-looking production that\u2019s sunk almost immediately by its practically reflexive devotion to cornpone clich\u00e9. On the page, the reader can hear the killer Wilfred James\u2019s words of confession \u2014 \u201cI believe there is another man inside of every man, a stranger, a Conniving Man\u201d \u2014 in any way he or she likes. In the movie, the actor Thomas Jane, as Wilfred, uses a cracker-barrel intonation that leads us to believe that at any moment he may punctuate his narration with the old faux-homey TV ad for baked goods: \u201cPepperidge Farm remembers.\u201dMr. Jane\u2019s performance is that of an actor portraying a type rather than a character, and it contrasts starkly with Molly Parker\u2019s work. Alas, Ms. Parker plays the wife, so she\u2019s not around all that long. (She comes back, but is not required to do much more than look rat-bitten, which the makeup department handles well.) Throughout the picture I kept thinking, this will surely get better as the scary scenes come around.

{"Headline": "The Trump Administration\u2019s Incoherent Stance on Competition", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPeter Thiel, Facebook\u2019s first outside investor, once wrote: \u201cCompetition is for losers. If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly.\u201d Executives at Facebook, Google and Amazon seem to have taken his blunt advice.If only the Trump administration could be so clear when it comes to its stance on competition. Instead, it has sent a schizophrenic message, which means the few remaining companies with a chance to rival big tech have no way of knowing where the administration stands or what values it will enforce.The incoherence of these conflicting positions on competition is staggering, but this kind of cognitive dissonance is not unique. Don\u2019t forget that the Obama administration \u2014 at the behest of Amazon, which controlled almost 80 percent of the online book market \u2014 brought an antitrust suit alleging Apple and five publishers colluded on pricing for digital books. That administration did not have a consistent view of media monopoly power that is enforced equally on all parties, and neither does the current one.For instance, internet service providers operate under a totally different set of privacy regulations than the online service providers (like Google and Facebook) that dominate the online advertising market. According to Morgan Stanley, Google and Facebook took an astonishing 85 percent of all new online ad revenue last year. And yet Google spends millions lobbying Congress to prevent any rivals from entering its unique surveillance capitalism business. Essentially, the government is giving a pass to the largest media advertising firms that have no restrictions on consumer privacy, while suing to block potential rival services that operate under strict privacy restrictions.Of course, being buried deep in Google\u2019s search results or being forced to pay Google for prominent placement hurts smaller firms. This is arguably no less harmful to a business than being forced to pay Verizon for good video quality for its streaming site \u2014 the fate that many content producers will meet if net neutrality rules are rolled back under the plan the F.C.C. has hinted at. It is what economists call \u201crent seeking,\u201d and it is a cancer on any open media system in any context, but the Trump administration doesn\u2019t treat it the same in all contexts.Mr. Trump is nothing if not sensitive to a populist uprising, and the net neutrality decision will probably be opposed on both the left and right. It could be that during the F.C.C.\u2019s comment period, the resistance to overturning net neutrality may be too strong and the ruling will be withdrawn.But that leaves the larger questions unanswered. What exactly would a consistent antitrust policy for the media sector look like? Is it possible to reconcile the conflicting signals from the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice?The answer is that regulators must realize where the real market power lies and use this as the basis for their decisions about competition. Time Warner\u2019s market capitalization is $70 billion. Google is worth 10 times as much, at $723 billion. Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner\u2019s largest advertising subsidiary, brought in $1.2 billion in ad revenue in the last quarter, while Google reported $22.5 billion in ad revenue in the same period. It should be noted that AT&T has almost no appreciable ad revenue. So, if there is to be a coherent approach to competition, the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates Google and Facebook, and the F.C.C., which regulates AT&T, must find common ground on the regulation of ad-supported content networks.For the Trump administration to try to block the merger of two relatively small media players while letting Google operate freely with no privacy restrictions is to be fighting the last war. The notion that television is the major media power in America ignores reality. It may be that the assistant attorney general for antitrust, Makan Delrahim, has a decent case that internet service providers and content providers need some sort of separation. But if that is true, then the same rules on neutrality and consumer privacy need to apply to companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 and the F.C.C. should keep net neutrality rules in place.The administration can\u2019t have it both ways.Jonathan Taplin is the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.I. Researchers Leave Elon Musk Lab to Begin Robotics Start-Up", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEMERYVILLE, Calif. \u2014 During a recent speech at the University of California, Berkeley, Pieter Abbeel played a video clip of a robot doing housework.The trick was that an engineer was operating the robot from afar, dictating its every move. But as Mr. Abbeel explained, the video showed that robotic hardware was nimble enough to mimic complex human behavior. It just needed software that could guide the hardware \u2014 without the help of that engineer.\u201cThis is largely a computer science problem \u2014 an artificial intelligence problem,\u201d Mr. Abbeel said. \u201cWe have the hardware that can do the job.\u201dTheir start-up, Embodied Intelligence, is backed by $7 million in funding from the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Amplify Partners and other investors. The company will specialize in complex algorithms that allow machines to learn tasks on their own. Using these methods, existing robots could learn to, for example, install car parts that aren\u2019t quite like the parts they have installed in the past, sort through a bucket of random holiday gifts as they arrive at a warehouse, or perform other tasks that machines traditionally could not.\u201cWe now have teachable robots,\u201d Mr. Abbeel said during a recent interview at the new company\u2019s offices in Emeryville, Calif., just across the bay from San Francisco.Robots already automate some work inside factories and warehouses, such as moving boxes from place to place at Amazon\u2019s massive distribution centers. But companies must program these machines for each particular task, limiting their possible applications. The hope is that robots can master a much wider array of tasks by learning on their own.\u201cToday, every motion that an industrial robot makes is specified down to the millimeter,\u201d said Sunil Dhaliwal, the Amplify founder who led the firm\u2019s investment in Embodied Intelligence. \u201cBut most real problems can\u2019t be solved that way. You have to be able not just to tell the robot what to do, but to tell it how to learn.\u201dMuch like Google and labs at Brown and Northeastern University, Embodied Intelligence is also augmenting these methods with a wide range of other machine learning techniques. Most notably, the start-up is exploring what is called imitation learning, a way for machines to learn discrete tasks from human demonstrations.The company is using this method to teach a two-armed robot to pick up plastic pipes from a table. Donning virtual reality headsets and holding motion trackers in their hands, Mr. Abbeel and his colleagues will repeatedly demonstrate the task in a digital world that recreates what is in front of a robot. Then the machine can then learn from this digital data.\u201cWe collect data on what the human is doing,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cThen we can train the machine to imitate the human.\u201dThese and similar machine learning methods have only begun to bear fruit over the past few years, but many believe they will overhaul the field of robotics. It is telling that OpenAI, a pure research lab that opened its doors less than two years ago, has now lost two big names to more commercial pursuits.Poached away from OpenAI by Mr. Musk himself, the machine learning expert Andrej Karpathy is now the director of A.I. at Tesla, working to help autonomous cars get smarter faster. And Mr. Abbeel is launching Embodied Intelligence. \u201cAndrej is stepping out of the research mode and saying: \u2018I want to do this in practice,\u2019\u201d Mr. Abbeel explained. \u201cThat same thing goes for us.\u201dHe said he believed his new start-up can rapidly push its methods into manufacturing operations like the auto industry. Although robotics already handle many tasks inside such factories, there are many others they can\u2019t yet master. That is what Embodied Intelligence hopes to change.Some researchers question how much these machine learning techniques will ultimately improve robotics, believing they are overhyped among both researchers and the news media. \u201cMachine learning is being thrown at so many problems in robotics,\u201d said Robert Howe, a professor of robotics at Harvard University. \u201cAnd it produces just enough results that people can trumpet it.\u201dBut Mr. Abbeel is among the world\u2019s top researchers in his field, and his decision to start a own company is an indication that machine learning will continue to push robotics forward.\u201cIt is obvious that this is what you need to build flexible, agile robotics,\u201d said Geoff Hinton, a pioneer of machine learning.Follow Cade Metz on Twiiter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Phone Comes Out. Yours Slows Down. A Conspiracy? No.", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixIt happens every year: Apple releases new iPhones, and then hordes of people groan about their older iPhones slowing to a crawl.The phenomenon of perceived slowdowns is so widespread that many believe tech companies intentionally cripple smartphones and computers to ensure that people buy new ones every few years. Conspiracy theorists call it planned obsolescence.That\u2019s a myth. While slowdowns happen, they take place for a far less nefarious reason. That reason is a software upgrade.\u201cThere\u2019s no incentive for operating system companies to create planned obsolescence,\u201d said Greg Raiz, a former program manager for Microsoft who worked on Windows XP. \u201cIt\u2019s software, and software has various degrees of production bugs and unintended things that happen.\u201dThe technical process of upgrading from an old operating system to a new one \u2014 migrating your files, apps and settings along the way \u2014 is extremely complicated. So when you install a brand-new operating system on an older device, problems may occur that make everything from opening the camera to browsing the web feel sluggish.The good news is that because tech companies are not intentionally neutering your devices, there are remedies for when you think your three-year-old iPhone or your seven-year-old Windows computer has become slow or short-lived. Here\u2019s a guide to speeding up your troubled gadgets, based on interviews with information technology professionals and operating system experts.Tech companies make it simple to upgrade to a new operating system by pressing an \u201cupdate\u201d button, which seamlessly migrates all your apps and data over. While that\u2019s convenient, it isn\u2019t the best way to ensure that things will continue running smoothly.A better practice is backing up all your data and purging everything from the device before installing the new operating system. This \u201cclean install\u201d works more reliably because the engineers developing operating systems were able to test this condition more easily, Mr. Raiz said.Let\u2019s say, for example, you have an iPhone 6 with 100 apps installed, four email accounts and 2,000 photos. It is more likely that a quality-assurance engineer tested installing a new operating system on a blank iPhone 6, rather than an iPhone 6 with the same setup as yours.Sometimes you can do some light maintenance to speed up your device. Over the long term, an operating system accumulates system files, settings, logs and other data; I.T. experts call this \u201ccruft.\u201d This can bog down your device.Here\u2019s something many people don\u2019t realize: Just because your iPhone or Samsung phone has 64 gigabytes of storage doesn\u2019t mean you should fill it all the way up. The device will generally run faster if more of its storage is available.That\u2019s partly because your device needs space to move data around and download software updates. But it\u2019s also related to how the storage technology works inside smartphones and modern laptops.Smartphones and newer laptops rely on flash storage, which stores data in the cells of semiconductor chips. When data is stored on a flash drive, it is scattered across the drive. So when you are pulling data to open an app or a document, you are retrieving it from multiple parts of the drive. If lots of space is occupied, the data gets crowded and the device may feel sluggish.\u201cIf you fill these things up, it doesn\u2019t get to operate as well,\u201d said Brian Denslow, a technician for TechCollective, an information technology consulting company in San Francisco. Mr. Denslow said a good rule of thumb is to buy more storage than you think you will use. If you think you are going to use 64 gigabytes on an iPad, for example, buy the 256-gigabyte model.Your device may seem slower for reasons unrelated to the device. Mr. Denslow, the technician, said many apps relied on an internet connection, so a shoddy Wi-Fi router might be the real bottleneck.\u201cInstead of spending $1,000 on a phone every year, spend $500 on networking,\u201d Mr. Denslow said. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy, but it provides more benefits over a long period of time.\u201dAt the end of the day, there are many reasons your device may feel slow. New operating systems carry more powerful features that were designed to work better on new devices. In addition, developers of third-party apps typically prioritize making software for newer handsets, and sometimes they even discontinue support for old gadgets. If there are important tasks that your older device cannot do proficiently, consider an upgrade.Mr. Raiz, the former Microsoft program manager, said he had recently encountered problems after updating his iPhone 6S to iOS 11. Some functions, like the ability to search for an app, no longer worked. Resetting the device\u2019s settings fixed the problem, but he said he would most likely buy a new iPhone soon anyway to keep up with the latest technologies.\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can do if your device is multiple release cycles behind,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Men at Work Wonder if They Overstepped With Women, Too", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It has been a confusing season for America\u2019s working men, as the conversation around workplace harassment reveals it to be a nationwide epidemic \u2014 and many men wonder if they were involved or ignored the signs.Consider Owen Cunningham, a director at San Francisco\u2019s KBM-Hogue design firm. When he looks toward the annual corporate holiday party these days, he shudders.\u201cCancel the holiday party,\u201d said Mr. Cunningham, 37, adding that he means just until it has been figured out how men and women should interact. He said he considered himself progressive on gender issues but was thinking more about the behavior he had seen in the past: \u201cWhat flirting is O.K.? Was I ever taking advantage of any meager power I had? You start to wonder.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything wrong,\u201d said Nick Matthews, 42, who works at PwC, formerly PricewaterhouseCoopers, and lives in San Francisco. \u201cBut has anything I\u2019ve done been interpreted another way?\u201dIn response, some men are forming all-male text groups at companies or in their industries to brainstorm on harassment issues. Some said they planned to be a lot more careful in interacting with women because they felt that the line between friendliness and sexual harassment was too easy to cross. Others are struggling to reconcile how these behaviors could happen even among men who believe in equal rights.Joel Milton, 30, an entrepreneur in Denver with Baker Technologies, a platform for cannabis dispensaries, said he had recently decided to be more careful about corporate offsites after seeing the swell of #MeToo claims.\u201cWhen I hear someone on my team is having a pool party, now I\u2019ll say, \u2018Hey, maybe no managers should be there,\u2019\u201d Mr. Milton said, relaying the type of information likely to be covered in many companies\u2019 employment manuals.He added that harassment was not something he had thought much about before, but that he was considering his own behavior more. \u201cLike, did I ever do anything?\u201d he said.Jonathan Segal, a lawyer who was on the commission\u2019s harassment task force, said he was now fielding odd questions from men about how to behave at work. At a fund-raiser last month in Palm Beach, Fla., some men asked him if it was permissible to hug a woman and where the boundaries should be drawn.Mr. Segal said he had explained to the men that the context mattered and that pretending there was a gray zone between collegial friendliness and sexual assault was absurd. For instance, he told them, hugging an old friend is very different from going up behind a co-worker while she was at a desk typing.\u201cIf someone can\u2019t understand that, then maybe they just shouldn\u2019t be hugging,\u201d he said.Mr. Segal, who runs anti-harassment training, is now expanding part of the program called Safe Mentoring, which teaches men how to mentor younger women without harassing them. At a recent session, a male supervisor talked about having an extra ticket to a sporting event and feeling he could invite only a male colleague; Mr. Segal went over how to invite a female colleague without sexually harassing her.\u201cThe answer to harassment cannot be avoiding women,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is men are backing away from the role that we try to encourage them to play, which is actively mentoring and sponsoring women in the workplace,\u201d said Al Harris, who has been running workplace equality programs and writing on the topic from Chicago with his partner, Andie Kramer, for many years. \u201cThere\u2019s apprehension on the part of men that they\u2019re going to be falsely accused of sexual harassment.\u201dNot everyone is practicing avoidance. Some men said the best route is to ask female co-workers directly if they feel harassed. Pat Lencioni, the founder of the Table Group in Lafayette, Calif., which does executive coaching for companies around issues like diversity, said he was doing just that and had asked the women at his office if they worried about harassment.\u201cI came into the office and said, \u2018Hey, guys, I\u2019ve got a question for you: This sexual harassment stuff, all these things, do you guys ever worry it\u2019s going to happen here?\u2019\u201d Mr. Lencioni, 52, recalled. \u201cAnd they were like: \u2018No, because we know you. We know who you are.\u2019\u201dHe said he thought this approach could be adopted more broadly.Other men said they had not talked about workplace harassment with anyone because they already knew what they needed to know. \u201cThis is a liberal town,\u201d said Philip Rontell, a real estate agent in Walnut Creek, Calif., who added that he supported the #MeToo campaign. \u201cWe all already know this stuff.\u201dWhen men do want to talk about workplace harassment, some said, they don\u2019t know where to go. \u201cI just don\u2019t know where those conversations are allowed to be had,\u201d said Ryan Ellis, 33, a sales manager for an e-commerce company in Santa Monica, Calif.Austin Gilbert, a recruiter in San Francisco for the company Gametime, said his industry had also had to deal with men talking in online chat rooms at work, which he said could \u201cbury\u201d and hide toxic comments. His company has closed several \u201chigh school in-group\u201d type of exclusionary work chats over the years, but he worries about more.\u201cWe have a policy of telling employees that we\u2019re free to review all electronic communications,\u201d Mr. Gilbert, 31, said. \u201cBut that\u2019s typically not anyone\u2019s job responsibility in a small company.\u201dOpen bars are being replaced with game zones. One client recently asked for an extremely watered-down \u201cJohn Daly\u201d to be the party\u2019s signature drink, which Ms. Freeman found strange but probably wise.After-work events are \u201cthe front line\u201d when it comes to harassment, and companies want \u201cmore safety precautions\u201d now, she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Search of Silence ", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byErling Kagge, a 54-year-old Norwegian explorer, author and publisher, was sitting one morning last month in the private gardens at the Church of St. Luke in the Fields, a green oasis of relative quiet in the West Village of Manhattan.\u201cYou never find a place that is total silence,\u201d Mr. Kagge said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking, and I have not found it.\u201d\u201cWhen you start, you have all the noise in your head,\u201d Mr. Kagge said, adding that by his journey\u2019s end, \u201cYou feel your brain is wider than the sky. You\u2019re a guy being part of this bigness, this greatness. To be alone and experience the silence feels very safe, very meaningful.\u201dMuch of the modern-day \u201cnoise\u201d that people wish to escape comes not from loud sounds or grating talk (though there are plenty of both), but from endless distractions. Mr. Kagge was inspired to write the book because, he said, he realized that his three daughters, who range in age from 15 to 21, have grown up with iPhones essentially attached to their bodies.\u201cMy daughters didn\u2019t know what silence was. There\u2019s always something happening, always temptations,\u201d Mr. Kagge said. He frets about the long-term effects of such overstimulation. \u201cSilence is not a trend,\u201d he said. \u201cSilence is something people have needed for thousands of years.\u201dHe had traveled from his home in Oslo to New York to take on a challenge that, in its own way, was no less difficult than walking to the South Pole: finding silence in the city.He\u2019d gotten off to a noisy start the day before when he\u2019d checked into his hotel and found an air-circulating unit churning outside his window. After waking in another room, he\u2019d walked down Eighth Avenue, only to be assaulted by the \u201cvisual noise\u201d of Manhattan in full morning rush. Now, even in an enclosed church garden, he couldn\u2019t escape the incessant grinding sound of workmen stripping paint from a building\u2019s fire escape one block south.But Mr. Kagge, who has strong features framed by a snowy beard, found the spot tranquil by comparison. \u201cAll these variations of green,\u201d he said, looking around. Mr. Kagge\u2019s own smartphone was tucked into his jeans pocket, where it would remain throughout the day, though he admits to general excessive checking of it, and consultation of Google. In his book, he quotes the 17th-century writer Blaise Pascal, who said, \u201cAll of humanity\u2019s problems stem from man\u2019s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not recommending people move into a monastery,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re social beings. But in the silence, you meet yourself.\u201dAn avid art collector, Mr. Kagge next thought to seek contemplative silence inside a museum. He decided against the Museum of Modern Art (\u201cMoMA is too successful\u201d) and instead settled on the less-visited Frick Collection, at Fifth Avenue and 70th Street. Heading uptown, he detoured to walk north along the High Line elevated park, hoping for a quiet aerie.At the High Line\u2019s West 30th Street and 10th Avenue exit, the decibel level reached peak cacophony. It was the heart of the Hudson Yards development project, right near a traffic-clogged entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. Car horns, jackhammers, rivet guns, workmen yelling, New Yorkers speed-walking to get somewhere \u2014 maybe the noisiest spot in the Western world.\u201cThis is pretty crazy,\u201d Mr. Kagge yelled.He quickened his pace, and farther uptown, when he entered Central Park, he stopped, smiled and said, \u201cFor the first time today, you can hear the wind.\u201dUPPER EAST SIDE HUSHMr. Kagge has experienced profound moments in nature. He told a story, one he tells in the book, about a sailing trip he took across the south Pacific Ocean, in 1986. He was on watch on deck, alone, after midnight, when he heard \u201ca sound that seemed like a long, deep breath,\u201d to the west of the boat. It was a surfacing whale, unseen but heard and felt in the darkness.\u201cIt made such a deep impression on me,\u201d Mr. Kagge said.Before going to the Frick, he wanted to stop by the Explorers Club, which is housed in a six-story mansion on East 70th Street. He was invited by its members to join after his headline-grabbing adventures \u2014 he has also skied to the North Pole and climbed Mount Everest, the so-called Third Pole \u2014 but rarely has a chance to visit. The club was empty of members at midday, and Mr. Kagge made his way upstairs, to a dark wood-paneled old room. There were no other people inside. There were no sounds of cars whirring by outside. There were no sounds at all. \u201cBut it\u2019s not fair,\u201d Mr. Kagge said, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s inside a private club.\u201dThe Frick, with its paintings by Rembrandt and other old masters, offered Mr. Kagge and the public a different kind of silence: the hushed reverence of museumgoers. After this there was a break: lunch at a crowded French bistro, and a trip to Dover Street Market, to get his daughters Supreme gear. No expectations there.When Mr. Kagge resumed the search for silence, he wanted to try a location in the boroughs outside Manhattan. A spot was suggested: Louis Valentino, Jr. Park and Pier, a little green space tucked along the waterfront in the Red Hook section Brooklyn.By the time Mr. Kagge got there, the news had broke that earlier that afternoon, a man had driven a truck through a crowd of people on a bike path in Lower Manhattan. Helicopters were hovering overhead in the distance. A police boat raced across the choppy water. The world seemed suddenly, scarily, noisy.And yet, at sunset, in the early evening chill, the park was deeply peaceful.Going out to the end of the pier, Mr. Kagge said, \u201cIf you walk 20 or 30 minutes in the city, you\u2019ll find a quiet place.\u201dA young man and woman were also on the pier talking in affectionate whispers. Mr. Kagge was silent for a long time, watching the sun set over the water.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to think silence is about turning your back on the world,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s opening up to the world, respecting more and loving life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

CNN and MSNBC, in contrast, aired at least an hour of nearly uninterrupted and ad-free coverage.Covering the indictmentsNot covering the indictmentsAdEach minuteof airtimeCheeseburgeremojisNewsweekOp-edHalloweencostumesAmericanpatriotismDossierFOXCNNMSNBC8 a.m.8:30 a.m.9 a.m.Covering the indictmentsNot covering the indictmentsAdEach minuteof airtimeAmericanpatriotismCheeseburgeremojisNewsweekOp-edHalloweencostumesDossierFOXCNNMSNBC8 a.m.8:30 a.m.9 a.m.Covering the indictmentsNot covering the indictmentsAdHalloweencostumesCheeseburgeremojisEach minuteof airtimeAmericanpatriotismNewsweekOp-edDossierFOXCNNMSNBC8:30 a.m.9 a.m.8 a.m.But during the hyperpolarized first year of this administration, the ways in which television networks cover the president are being deeply scrutinized \u2013 particularly as the investigation by Mr. Mueller draws closer to the White House.

Any negative coverage of the president usually prompts a flurry of tweets cataloguing the differences among networks in their chyron text. While CNN, MSNBC and the BBC are typically in alignment, Monday morning was a particularly stark example of how Fox News pushes its own version of reality.To right-leaning media observers, the coverage by the other networks might seem equally troubling: does the Manafort indictment deserve an hour or more of uninterrupted airtime? On many stories, there could be legitimate differences in news judgment by editors and producers at competing news outlets, in turn leading to varying focuses in coverage.But, whatever the reason, such a stark difference in one network\u2019s coverage of this case, as well as the well-documented political preferences of its viewers, underscore how far political polarization has seeped into the news business.Advertisement"}

The announcement followed a rancorous proxy fight by activist investor Mick McGuire, which resulted in his firm Marcato Capital Management placing three directors \u2014 including Mr. McGuire \u2014 onto Buffalo Wild Wings\u2019 board.Marcato, which owns 6.4 percent of Buffalo Wild Wings, said it will vote in favor of the Arby\u2019s deal.

The reason why? Primarily that Emerson couldn\u2019t meet its fellow industrial parts maker\u2019s price expectations \u2014 and had no other negotiating levers to pull.Rockwell had repeatedly said that it viewed the takeover bids as too low. By going public, Emerson was hoping to get shareholders in the target company to apply pressure on management. That didn\u2019t work, however: Shares in Rockwell never meaningfully approached the level of any of its suitor\u2019s proposals, suggesting that investors weren\u2019t particularly hoping for a deal.And Rockwell had some defenses that Emerson couldn\u2019t breach, including a staggered board and no provision for shareholders to call special meetings. That meant Emerson couldn\u2019t wage a proper proxy fight to replace directors at the target company\u2019s board.\u201cInstead of engaging in constructive dialogue, the Rockwell board decided to let this unique and value-generative opportunity go unexplored,\u201d David Farr, Emerson\u2019s chairman and C.E.O., said in a statement.Looks like deal junkies will have to wait for Broadcom to go hostile against Qualcomm for their merger fight fix.It has now been more than three weeks since Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the face of the kingdom\u2019s business elite for decades, was detained without explanation as part of a purported anticorruption drive.

{"Headline": "After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "The Paradise PapersThe tech giant has found a tax haven in the island of Jersey, leaving billions of dollars untouched by the United States, leaked documents reveal.Supported byTim Cook was angry.\u201cWe pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar,\u201d Mr. Cook declared at the hearing. \u201cWe don\u2019t depend on tax gimmicks,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe don\u2019t stash money on some Caribbean island.\u201dTrue enough. The island Apple would soon rely on was in the English Channel.Five months after Mr. Cook\u2019s testimony, Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the small island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income.Apple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.The previously undisclosed story of Apple\u2019s search for a new tax haven and its use of Jersey is among the findings emerging from a cache of secret corporate records from Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm that caters to businesses and the wealthy elite.The documents reveal how big law firms help clients weave their way through the gaps between different countries\u2019 tax rules. Appleby clients have transferred trademarks, patent rights and other valuable assets into offshore shell companies, avoiding billions of dollars in taxes. The rights to Nike\u2019s Swoosh trademark, Uber\u2019s taxi-hailing app, Allergan\u2019s Botox patents and Facebook\u2019s social media technology have all resided in shell companies that listed as their headquarters Appleby offices in Bermuda and Grand Cayman, the records show.\u201cU.S. multinational firms are the global grandmasters of tax avoidance schemes that deplete not just U.S. tax collection but the tax collection of most every large economy in the world,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a former corporate tax adviser to such companies who is now a law professor at the University of Southern California.Indeed, tax strategies like the ones used by Apple \u2014 as well as Amazon, Google, Starbucks and others \u2014 cost governments around the world as much as $240 billion a year in lost revenue, according to a 2015 estimate by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The disclosures come on the heels of last week\u2019s proposals by Republican lawmakers to provide several new tax benefits for multinational companies, including cutting the federal corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. President Trump has said that American businesses are getting a bad deal under current rules.But the documents show how major American companies find creative ways to avoid paying anything close to 35 percent.Apple, for example, pays taxes at a small fraction of that rate on its offshore profits, according to calculations by The Times based on the company\u2019s securities filings. Apple reports that nearly 70 percent of its worldwide profits are earned offshore.An Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, declined to answer most questions about the company\u2019s tax strategy. He did say that Apple had told regulators \u2014 in the United States and Ireland and at the European Commission \u2014 about the reorganization of its Irish subsidiaries. \u201cThe changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cAt Apple we follow the laws, and if the system changes we will comply. We strongly support efforts from the global community toward comprehensive international tax reform and a far simpler system.\u201dIn prepared statements, Allergan, Facebook, Nike and Uber said they complied with tax regulations around the world.Congressional Republicans are also seeking to impose a 10 percent tax on some of the profits that American businesses say are earned offshore \u2014 half the rate they are proposing for profits in the United States. The lawmakers have also proposed another break, permitting multinationals to bring home more than $2.6 trillion stowed offshore at sharply reduced tax rates. Both proposals, critics say, would only create additional incentives for businesses like Apple to shift more profits into island hideaways.Appleby is a member of the global network of lawyers, accountants and bankers who set up or manage offshore companies and accounts for clients who want to avoid taxes or keep their finances a secret from authorities, business partners or even spouses. The firm did not respond to questions from The Times about its work for Apple or other companies.Tax authorities have challenged several of the offshore structures maintained by Appleby and Estera, a spinoff of the law firm\u2019s corporate services business. Nike won a fight over back taxes with the Internal Revenue Service a year ago; a similar dispute between the I.R.S. and Facebook is continuing.European regulators are trying to force countries including Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to collect back taxes from big companies that relied on offshore arrangements. Apple is being pursued for $14.5 billion in back taxes after European regulators ruled that its old tax structure amounted to illegal state aid from the Irish government.Since the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens. Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions \u2014 mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2014 now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the world\u2019s population.Criticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.In May 2013, the Senate\u2019s investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apple\u2019s tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared \u201ctax residency\u201d nowhere in the world.Under Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is \u201cmanaged and controlled\u201d abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax. By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.At the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there. The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.\u201cApple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,\u201d then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.Ireland\u2019s finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, at first defended his country\u2019s policies: \u201cI do not want to be the whipping boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.\u201d Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies. Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.But by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.At that time, Apple had accumulated $111 billion in offshore cash, mostly in its Irish subsidiaries. Billions of dollars in new profits poured into them each year. Yet they paid almost no corporate income tax.Company officials wanted to keep it that way. So Apple sought alternatives to the tax arrangement Ireland would soon shut down. And the officials wanted to be quiet about it.\u201cFor those of you who are not aware Apple are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,\u201d wrote Cameron Adderley, global head of Appleby\u2019s corporate department, in a March 20, 2014 email to other senior partners. \u201cThey also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.\u201dIn building Apple\u2019s new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor. A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago. The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax regulators. It has also fought international proposals for tax avoidance crackdowns.Baker McKenzie wanted to use a local Appleby office to maintain an offshore arrangement for Apple. For Appleby, Mr. Adderley said, this assignment was \u201ca tremendous opportunity for us to shine on a global basis with Baker McKenzie.\u201dBaker McKenzie\u2019s San Francisco office emailed a 14-item questionnaire in March 2014 to Appleby\u2019s offices in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey.\u201cConfirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities (such as board meetings, signing of important contracts) without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction,\u201d the document requested. Baker McKenzie also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: \u201cAre there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?\u201d(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, \u201cAs a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.\u201d)Apple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Appleby\u2019s office in Jersey, which is one of the Channel Islands and has strong links to the British banking system. Jersey makes its own laws and is not subject to most European Union legislation, making it a popular tax haven.But the plan to use Jersey faced a potential snag: In mid-2014, again under pressure from other governments, Irish ministers explored ending a tax shelter known as the \u201cdouble Irish,\u201d used by scores of companies, including the Appleby clients Allergan and Facebook, as well as Google, LinkedIn and other businesses.The double Irish allows companies to collect profits through one subsidiary that employs people in Ireland, then route those profits to an Irish mailbox subsidiary that is a tax resident of an offshore haven like Bermuda, Grand Cayman or the Isle of Man.Irish officials explored a ban on Irish companies claiming tax residency in tax havens. Executives at Allergan \u2014 which had used a double Irish for at least a decade, records show \u2014 tried to derail the rule change. Terilea Wielenga, then Allergan\u2019s head of tax, was also international president of the Tax Executives Institute, a trade group. She argued to the Irish finance ministry in July 2014 that any such changes should occur slowly.The campaign seemed to work. \u201cFor existing companies, there will be provision for a transition period until the end of 2020,\u201d Mr. Noonan declared in October 2014. The gradual phase-in would apply not just to existing companies but to any new ones created by December of that year.This gave Apple just enough time. By the end of the year, Jersey had become the new tax home of the Irish companies Apple Sales International and Apple Operations International.But a third Apple subsidiary, Apple Operations Europe, became resident in Ireland.Apple would not say why. But tax experts offer one possible reason. While media attention focused on Ireland\u2019s crackdown on the double Irish, officials announced a new measure: The country expanded its tax deductions for companies that move rights to intellectual property \u2014 like patents and trademarks \u2014 into Ireland. If an Irish company spent $15 billion buying such rights, even from a fellow subsidiary, it could claim a $1 billion tax deduction each year for 15 years.Apple declined to say whether it has availed itself of the new benefit.But J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova law professor and former I.R.S. official who reviewed the Appleby documents, concluded that there was a strong possibility the company moved intellectual property into Ireland to take advantage of the generous tax rules. Based on Apple\u2019s American securities filings, he estimated that the transfer was worth about $200 billion.That would mean that any income that Apple now generates in Ireland could be partially offset by more than $13 billion in tax deductions each year for 15 years.Apple\u2019s hunt for a tax haven is a familiar tale, said Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, who also reviewed the Appleby documents.\u201cThis is how it usually works: You close one tax shelter, and something else opens up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just goes on endlessly.\u201dSimon Bowers is a reporter for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Advertisement"}

The staff communicated mainly through Slack, the messaging app. WeWork, with its cold brew iced coffee on tap, supplied a fun-ish workplace with no personal design touches, and Slack enabled camaraderie without actual discussions.When the two friends started the company in 2007, with $350,000 in seed money, their plan was to produce e-cards, build a following and possibly sell to a larger company.The first two steps came quickly. Using stock line drawings found on the internet, they wrote wry texts \u2014 an early favorite was, \u201cWhen work feels overwhelming, remember that you\u2019re going to die\u201d \u2014 and posted them on Facebook. When people clicked on a card, it sent them to the company website, which contained paid advertising. Within a year, the site was drawing 1.5 million visitors a month. The founders hired more writers. Traffic to the site reached 5 million visitors a month.Then four years ago, something changed. Cards that might once have reached 200,000 people were suddenly reaching only a few hundred, Mr. Mitchell said.By then, Facebook had become the equivalent of television in the 1960s, said Nicole Ames, who runs a digital marketing firm called Twist IMC. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest dog on the porch,\u201d she said. But for the companies that grew there, she said, it was impossible to know what formula it used to determine which posts appeared in users\u2019 news feeds. When Facebook cut down on images that directed users to other sites, companies like Someecards were blindsided.\u201cYou spent years building up this organic following, and now your content no longer shows up unless you pay,\u201d Ms. Ames said. \u201cI tell clients all the time, you play in Facebook\u2019s playpen, and if they change something, it\u2019s their game, it\u2019s their rules.\u201dAlthough e-cards remain popular, they now mostly provide an identity for the company, distinguishing it from other internet humor sites, Mr. Mitchell said. Freelancers submit texts for cards, and earn $25 for each one chosen.\u201cTwelve million people can look at them on Facebook, but we don\u2019t make any money from that,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. The company tried to sell the cards for a while, but there was not enough interest.Instead, the staff uses the Someecards style to create branded advertising for Showtime, Splenda and other clients, relying on Facebook shares.\u201cIf we can make you happy enough to share it with your friends, then your friends will be advertised to, and you\u2019ll be advertising,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cFacebook\u2019s algorithm plays to that too. If we post this and people don\u2019t like it, it goes away. We need you to share.\u201dMr. Lundy said he had given up worrying about the uncertainty, because there was nothing he could do about it. But Mr. Mitchell pointed to a recent experiment in six countries, where Facebook stopped including posts from publishers in users\u2019 news feeds, relegating them to a separate feed. Companies lost most of their readership overnight, Mr. Mitchell said.\u201cGoogle and Facebook have so much power,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cWhen they make these changes you have to be ready and have ideas. There could be a day where we\u2019re out of ideas. Hasn\u2019t happened yet. So I worry about it. I try to keep that concern in that place that doesn\u2019t paralyze you, but keeps you motivated to keep doing new things.\u201dIn the meantime, the company survives by Facebook\u2019s algorithms and the tastes of the American public, which turns out to favor a vivid dermatology video.\u201cI\u2019ve had friends complain,\u201d Mr. Mitchell admitted. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t look at Dr. Pimple Popper. But all I can say is, the way Facebook works, if you people out there weren\u2019t clicking on Dr. Pimple Popper, it wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201dThis, he said, is a winning formula, at least for now.\u201cSomebody is watching that stuff, and a lot of people are watching it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Fantasy", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChildren\u2019s BooksEmika Chen is a rainbow-haired, electric skateboarding teenage bounty hunter in a futuristic New York City who, on the verge of getting evicted from her ratty apartment, glitches her way into a massively popular virtual reality game to steal a valuable power-up. The book opens with a mock news story about the game\u2019s 21-year-old creator, the mysterious Hideo Tanaka; an appended correction notes: \u201cAn earlier version of this story mistakenly described Hideo Tanaka as a millionaire. He is a billionaire.\u201d Whoops. Hideo, impressed that Emika has managed to breach his system (this is also a metaphor), flies her to Tokyo in his private jet to compete as a wild card in the international Warcross championships and figure out the identity of a certain nefarious cybercriminal.The book is as visual, kinetic and furiously paced as any video game; Lu, a former art director for video games as well as the author of the best-selling Legend series, has quite the way with otherworldly action scenes. Each round of the game is played in a different immersive environment; special NeuroLink glasses allow the real and virtual worlds to mesh. One particularly vivid round takes place in an icy wilderness filled with glaciers, \u201cshifting and cracking under their own weight,\u201d with monstrous animals frozen inside them \u2014 a white wolf with a missing eye, a snakelike dragon, a woolly mammoth. There\u2019s romance, a lost sibling, spying, a diverse cast of gamers and nifty tattoos. It\u2019s \u201cGleaming the Cube\u201d meets \u201cStrange Days\u201d meets \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d and it\u2019s a lot of fun. If the cliffhanger ending seems irksome, never fear, this one\u2019s a series opener.So much cool stuff but, alas, so little editing. Set in the Gothamesque Gatlon City, this first in a series introduces powerful superheroes and their down-but-not-out nemeses. Years ago, the Renegades (the good guys \u2014 or are they?) defeated the Anarchists, who have retreated to crumbling subway tunnels. Teenage Anarchist Nova (villain name: Nightmare), who blames the Renegades and their governing Council for her parents\u2019 murder, goes undercover to infiltrate them. But she doesn\u2019t count on an attraction to the enigmatic and hot Adrian, whose two dads are Renegade royalty, Captain Chromium and the Dread Warden. He and Nova debate the idea of vigilante justice and question whether Renegades allow regular people to shrug off responsibility for creating an ethical society.There are dozens of characters and secret identities, and awkward phrases like \u201chis pallor was ghastly pale\u201d and \u201chis face took on a look of exultation.\u201d It can feel like a too-long X-Men movie. But some of the characters\u2019 powers are superfun (creating tattoos and drawings that become real, controlling an army of bees) and when everyone learns everyone else\u2019s identities and secret pasts \u2014 presumably in the next book \u2014 well, Holy Surprise Party, Batman.Feminism is the invisible jet powering this literary revamp of the Amazon princess. Bardugo\u2019s version offers a new explanation for Princess Diana\u2019s departure from Themyscira. A young woman named Alia Mayeux Keralis is shipwrecked off the coast, and Diana rescues her. But Alia is a Warbringer, a descendant of Helen of Troy whose very presence causes conflict and chaos. If Diana can help Alia get to Helen\u2019s final resting place before time runs out, she can change Alia\u2019s destiny \u2026 and the world\u2019s.After a slow start (the somber Themysciran scene-setting and stilted, formal way the Amazons speak aren\u2019t much fun), the plot takes off, with a lot of action and humor. Alia, who is half Greek-American and half black, brings Diana to her country. (When the duo magically land in New York Harbor, Diana looks up to see \u201ca vibrant yellow torch held aloft by the statue of an Amazon, her stern face framed by a crown like a sunburst.\u201d) They team up with Alia\u2019s older brother Jason, crush object Theo and best friend Nim, racing to change the course of history. Meanwhile, terrifying gods of war and chaos, as well as human soldiers, keep attacking. Nim is a delicious character \u2014 an asymmetrical-haircut-sporting Indian-American girl with multiple piercings and a wicked sense of humor. Bardugo makes her both fat and hot, describing her as a \u201csparkly, round-cheeked sparrow.\u201dAs always, Diana\u2019s interactions with the Western world are a good time (\u201cIs Google one of your gods?\u201d she asks). And it\u2019s lovely that this is a hero\u2019s journey times two. Alia taps into her own bravery and Diana learns about sexism, racism and something the Amazons have always dismissed: the courage, resilience and ingenuity of mere mortals.Every sentence in this gorgeous little novel feels perfect and necessary. Ness, a Carnegie Medal winner, has said that \u201cRelease\u201d is influenced by two classics: Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cMrs Dalloway\u201d and Judy Blume\u2019s \u201cForever.\u201d (I know, right?) The book has the structure of the former \u2014 a vast amount of emotional action packed into a single day \u2014 and the hyperintensity, sexual heat and empathy for teenagers of the latter. Adam Thorn is 17 and gay, a conservative preacher\u2019s son trapped in rural Washington State. He wants to love and be loved, and he wants to feel understood. He picks up a rose at a flower shop (who will he give it to? His best friend, Angela? His ex, Enzo? His current boyfriend, Linus?) and pricks his thumb \u2026 and as the drop of blood falls we\u2019re suddenly in a different world. There\u2019s a Queen, a faun, a vengeful spirit, a murder and a sense of encroaching doom.The action switches back and forth between the two worlds, both filled with grief and loss and mistakes. Gradually, it becomes clear that both narratives are about the power of a single moment to change everything. It sounds heavy, but it isn\u2019t \u2014 Adam and his friends are very funny, and seeing flawed characters trying their hardest to forgive and to grow is truly touching. Also, the sex scenes are so hot they practically set the pages on fire. Ness\u2019s writing is lush without seeming to strain: A bad boyfriend is \u201call neck and rage,\u201d Mount Rainier at sunset turns \u201can unseemly, intimate pink.\u201d In an era when young adult books often feel bloated and meandering, this focused, humane book is a joy.\u201cIn Other Lands\u201d is at once a classic school story, a coming-of-age tale and a parody of Harry Potter. It\u2019s hilarious and sneakily moving. Elliot Schafer is Harry Potter if Harry had been abandoned instead of merely orphaned. Convinced of his unlovability, he wields sarcasm and braininess as weapons.As the book opens, Elliot is 13. On a field trip to Devon, England, he sees a wall few other kids can see. On the other side: the otherlands. Elliot, a huge reader of fantasy novels, is thrilled. Alas, the humans and harpies and trolls and elves and mermaids and vicious red-eyed, virginity-obsessed unicorns populating the otherlands turn out to be perpetually at war, and Elliot is a pacifist. \u201cOh no,\u201d he moans, as a dagger flies by his head. \u201cThis is magic Sparta.\u201d But he has no reason to go home, so he enters the Border camp\u2019s councilor-in-training program. And he makes two non-nerd friends: A gorgeous elf named Serene-Heart-in-the-Chaos-of-Battle and a perfect-seeming blond human jock.Brennan subverts the familiar Y.A. love triangle in uproarious, touching, unexpected ways, and her commentaries on gender roles, sexual identity and toxic masculinity are very witty. Elven culture, for instance, views men as the weaker sex. \u201cA true gentleman\u2019s heart is as sacred as a temple, and as easily crushed as a flower,\u201d Serene informs Elliot. When another elf tells him, \u201cI was saddened to hear Serene had launched a successful attack on the citadel of your virtue,\u201d Elliot assures her, \u201cThe citadel was totally into surrendering.\u201d Best of all, over four years in the otherlands, Elliot grows from a defensive, furious, grieving child into a diplomatic, kind, menschy hero.Marjorie Ingall is a columnist for Tablet and the author of \u201cMamaleh Knows Best: What Jewish Mothers Do to Raise Successful, Creative, Empathetic, Independent Children.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Iraqi Town Where Muslims, Jews and Christians Coexist, in Theory", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmadiya JournalAMADIYA, Iraq \u2014 This once-pretty picture postcard town, on its own 4,000-foot high mesa nestling between a pair of much higher mountain ranges, is in a bad neighborhood when it comes to tolerance.So the mystery of the Jewish holy figure Hazana, who is revered here by people of all the local faiths, is even more profound than it might otherwise be.Today Amadiya\u2019s population of 9,000 is overwhelmingly Kurdish Muslim. But in the early 20th century there were said to be about two-thirds that many people, about evenly divided among Muslims, Christians and Jews \u2014 although there were 10 mosques compared with two churches and two synagogues. Everyone was packed into a circumference of a mile and a half.Amadiya\u2019s Jews all left after the creation of Israel in 1948. And so many Christians have left amid successive regional upheavals that the remaining 20 or 30 families can no longer sustain both churches.All three faiths here are brought together by a longstanding reverence for Hazana, a Jewish religious figure of unknown antiquity \u2014 variously described as a son of David, the grandson of Joseph or just a little-known prophet \u2014 whose tomb is in Amadiya.\u201cAll the religions are going to that grave to pray,\u201d said Muhammad Abdullah, a local teacher and amateur historian. \u201cFor all three religions, it\u2019s a sacred place. Each of them thinks he belongs to them.\u201dHazana\u2019s biography is so hazy that he defeats a Google search. Locals don\u2019t have much to add. He was \u201ca really great guy, a pure person,\u201d said Bzhar Ahmad, 55, a retired government worker who had just emerged from noon prayers at the town\u2019s Amadi Grand Mosque, with a group of other Muslim worshipers nodding agreement.None of the men found it strange that Muslims and Christians also prayed at Hazana\u2019s tomb. \u201cThe Jews were always our friends,\u201d Mr. Ahmad said. \u201cWe never thought about what we were, we were just people living together.\u201dDirections given by locals to find Hazana\u2019s tomb varied, but all ended up in a crooked lane narrow enough that in Amadiya\u2019s heyday there were footbridges connecting roofs from one side to the other so that residents could use their rooftops to go to the mosque while avoiding the visitors in the overcrowded lanes below. Or so they say.On the way, opposite a chicken coop with a roof festooned in flowering potted plants, Saran Sabah stood with her 18-year-old daughter, Amal. In the side alley leading to her house was a huge pile of firewood, ready for the coming winter. A Sunni Muslim, Ms. Sabah had prayed to Hazana, and it had worked, she said; there was a daughter to prove it.The men hadn\u2019t mentioned that Hazana\u2019s popularity rested on his ability to bring fertility to supplicants, but later confirmed it. Borhan Said, a local Muslim resident and retired government worker, said people asked for other things as well. \u201cHe was a religious man who was so clear and so devout,\u201d he said.It almost sounded as if they had met, but it turned out that Mr. Said was not even sure what epoch Hazana came from. \u201cHe was before my father\u2019s father, that\u2019s all I know,\u201d he said.Mr. Said pointed out the nondescript red metal gate of what had been the old synagogue, unlocked and unguarded, and said visitors were welcome. Inside was a garden of fig trees and pomegranates, trumpet creepers and hibiscus, unkempt but well-watered. Purple and blue prayer cloths, used by those who came to ask Hazana\u2019s help, were hanging on some of the bushes.Here and there were piles of rubble, old stone building blocks and sections of walls \u2014 the remains of the synagogue itself. Cut into the earth was a stone staircase leading to an underground tomb.On the plastered walls inside the tomb was some fairly recent graffiti in Hebrew script, the verses of a religious song, along with an emoji-like smiley face, plus a Star of David sketched over Hazana\u2019s plain rectangular sarcophagus.Just what accounts for the town\u2019s communal tolerance, people say they\u2019re not sure, except that it has always been so. \u201cWe grew up like this,\u201d Mr. Said said. \u201cMy father always taught me to be like this and I teach my son the same.\u201dSome attribute it to Amadiya\u2019s history. Take the Amadi Grand Mosque, for example, the biggest and oldest of the town\u2019s 10 mosques. Speculation runs that it was originally a temple for the ancient Romans\u2019 Mithraic cult. Then, say locals, the building became a Jewish synagogue for centuries before becoming a Christian church for more centuries and finally, after the arrival of Islam 800 years ago, a mosque.How much of that is actually true is debatable; Amadiya is such an out-of-the-way place that it seems not to have been much studied.It would be easy to say that part of the secret of Amadiya\u2019s harmony is simply that most of the other faiths have now left town, though some Jews have visited recently to help restore Hazana\u2019s tomb and to pray there.But locals insist that would be unfair. Nafae Paulis is the caretaker of the Chaldean church and a veteran of the Kurdish pesh merga Special Forces who is now retired after years of battling the Islamic State. He talked as if the other faiths were still around in numbers as before.\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of Amadiya,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this small place you can find Muslims, Jews, Christians.\u201dEven if not actually true, it is a nice sentiment.Follow Rod Nordland on Twitter @rodnordlandAdvertisement"}

He knew his favorite color was gray when he was 5. \u201cI think brightness is a bit overrated,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I could paint the world a nice, dark, comforting gray, I would. I might be the perfect Londoner.\u201d\u201cThe idea with the sculpture is that guests would immediately know they were no longer in a regular, predictable environment,\u201d says Toogood, who began her career as decoration editor for The World of Interiors magazine, and, since striking out on her own a decade ago, now designs furniture (such as her signature resin Roly-Poly chair, which resembles the bottom half of a cartoon elephant), art and even unisex, smocklike garments. While some British designers fight against the country\u2019s climate by whitewashing walls and installing abundant lighting, Toogood, like Atalla, embraces its dreariness. \u201cPainting things white means you lose a lot of the nuance that comes with the subtle light that passes through a space over the course of a day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt flattens things and makes them boring.\u201dThe overall effect is monumental and a bit formal, but leavened by clear, pale sunlight that, on good days at least, streams through the 12-foot windows and the three skylights. The public areas are divided by an atrium with a retractable glass ceiling; Toogood turned the area beneath into a contemplative place for morning coffee by staggering five floating plaster shelves on the wall, each topped with a bonsai, with hopes that Atalla would tend to them for years to come. In the evening, as the lights of Regent\u2019s Canal flicker below, and the sprawling city is laid out in endless vistas, Atalla says the spare space is \u201cso glamorous you just don\u2019t want to move.\u201dAnother reason the apartment feels welcoming despite its austerity is that everything is a bit closer to the ground than usual; Atalla, who had polio as a baby, uses a wheelchair. By playing with scale \u2014 emphasizing the horizontal over the vertical, and slightly changing the proportions of some furniture, including the sofa and bed \u2014 Toogood didn\u2019t have to sacrifice streamlined beauty for accessibility.The design team did face one challenge, though: getting Atalla to feel comfortable with art. In the past, he shied from it. \u201cI never wanted to be one of those pretentious people who get rich and suddenly they\u2019re spending all their money in galleries, pretending they have taste,\u201d he says. Still, Toogood\u2019s staff convinced him to let her craft a few pieces.

{"Headline": "In Reversal, Tech Companies Back Sex Trafficking Bill", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe companies had argued that they had worked hard to combat sex trafficking on their services, but that the bill would jeopardize a free and open internet, as well as subject them to many potential lawsuits for the actions of users.But companies have come under increasingly harsh scrutiny in recent weeks, particularly for their role helping to spread Russia propaganda during the 2016 presidential election. This week, executives at Facebook, Twitter and Google faced tough questions from lawmakers in three congressional hearings.After weeks of negotiating over details, an internet lobbying group announced on Friday that it had ended its battle to squash the bill.The bill \u201cwill grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association.Congressional aides said the internet companies had been invited to weigh in on the bill before it was introduced in August, but they declined. The companies then forcefully came out in opposition, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users were hard to police.Lawmakers said the new bill contained modest changes that clarified that state law enforcement officials would have to use federal law as their basis of suits, one of the final sticking points for the companies. And the new draft contained language that only websites that knowingly assisted and supported sex trafficking would be targeted.\u201cThis important bill will hold online sex traffickers accountable and help give trafficking survivors the justice they deserve,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The bill amends Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, established in 1996, that protects online companies from liability over content they hosted on their sites. Companies say that law has allowed internet services like Google and Facebook to thrive.But with broad support, legislators said some smaller companies had hidden behind Section 230.\u201cRemoving the unwarranted shield from legal responsibility will save countless children from horrific tragedy, both physical and emotional,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said.Consumer advocates said that the law put the big companies on notice as well.\u201cThis is a chink in the Teflon of Google and Facebook\u2019s shield of immunity,\u201d said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge Tells Uber Lawyer: \u2018It Looks Like You Covered This Up\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The last-minute evidence quickly mounted. A letter and an email full of damning claims. Apps that sent self-destructing messages. A payment of $4.5 million to an employee who threatened to be a whistle-blower \u2014 and an additional $3 million to his lawyer.In two days of testimony that ended Wednesday in Federal District Court in San Francisco, Uber lawyers had to defend what a federal judge has described as an effort to withhold evidence from an intellectual-theft trial. The case pits the ride-hailing company against Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet.On Wednesday, Judge Alsup continued to upbraid Uber\u2019s lawyers for not being more forthcoming with evidence. \u201cI have never seen a case where there were so many bad things done like Uber has done in this case,\u201d he said.The letter that caused the trial to be delayed was written by a lawyer for Richard Jacobs, a former employee in Uber\u2019s security team, to Angela Padilla, the company\u2019s deputy general counsel. Thirty-seven pages long, it detailed a list of questionable behavior at Uber, including spying on competitors and using special laptop computers and self-destructing messaging apps that would hide communications.On Wednesday, Ms. Padilla testified that the letter, which has not been made public in its entirety, was \u201cclearly extortionist\u201d and filled with \u201cfantastical\u201d information.She said Uber had planned to fire Mr. Jacobs because its security team had caught him downloading sensitive company information to his personal computer. Mr. Jacobs responded, Ms. Padilla said, by sending an email to Travis Kalanick, the company\u2019s chief executive at the time, and others complaining of criminal and unethical behavior inside Uber.That email to Mr. Kalanick also didn\u2019t surface in the long evidence discovery process between Waymo and Uber lawyers, and was presented in court for the first time on Wednesday.After Mr. Jacobs left Uber, his lawyer sent the 37-page letter to Ms. Padilla as part of settlement negotiations in May. Ms. Padilla said the company had not shared this letter with the legal team handling the Waymo case because Uber hadn\u2019t wanted to compromise an internal investigation into its claims.Judge Alsup said to Ms. Padilla that \u201con the surface, it looks like you covered this up\u201d and tried to keep the letter out of the hands of Waymo\u2019s lawyers.The company did share the letter from Mr. Jacobs\u2019s lawyer with three different United States attorney offices, because Mr. Jacobs had threatened to take his claims to federal prosecutors and Uber wanted to \u201ctake the air out of his extortionist balloon,\u201d Ms. Padilla testified.Nonetheless, Uber paid a $3 million settlement to the lawyer who wrote the letter in addition to the $4.5 million paid to Mr. Jacobs. As part of the deal, Mr. Jacobs was kept on as a security consultant, Ms. Padilla testified. His job: investigating the claims made in the letter his lawyer wrote.Mr. Jacobs received $2 million up front and was to receive $1 million spread over 12 months and $1.5 million in stock, also spread out over 12 months. The deal included a so-called clawback measure that would require him to return the money if he discussed his claims with outsiders, Ms. Padilla testified. But he was allowed to talk about it with the government in the case of an investigation.Judge Alsup questioned why Uber would pay so much to an employee making bogus claims. \u201cTo someone like me, an ordinary mortal, and to ordinary mortals out there in the audience \u2014 people don\u2019t pay that kind of money for B.S.,\u201d the judge said.Uber\u2019s rationale for the settlement: It would cost less to settle with him than to fight him in court. Also, Mr. Jacobs\u2019s claims could hurt Uber\u2019s reputation, Ms. Padilla testified.In a statement, an Uber spokeswoman, Chelsea Kohler, said: \u201cToday\u2019s hearing changed nothing about the facts of Waymo\u2019s case, and did nothing to support their claims that Uber is using their alleged trade secrets. We look forward to our day in court and are as confident in the merits of our case as ever.\u201dA Waymo spokesman, Johnny Luu, said in a statement: \u201cToday\u2019s revelations fit Uber\u2019s pattern of destroying and withholding reams of evidence relevant to our trade secrets case, and that those at the very top of Uber were aware of these inexcusable practices. We look forward to the additional discovery granted by the court and to presenting our case in front of a jury at trial.\u201dFollow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}

Add a comment on this post or tag us on Twitter and let us know, or choose one of our recent writing prompts and weigh in.AdvertisementIn relation to Mr. Kagge\u2019s point of silence, I interpret silence as a place where you can find mental happiness and peace at any given time in your life after going through through stress, anger, or pressure... Silence is your break from society and moment of debriefing and relaxation. Silence should be able to be found at any place you choose whether that be your bedroom, practice room, or even school. To find silence it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be quiet per se, it\u2019s simply a place where you can break from your frustration.As many distractions iPhones can create, using a phone could also be one of these many coping methods that people may use to find peace. I personally find silence through listening to music and as ironic it may sound, music helps me separate myself from the distractions that bother me. Whether these distractions are visual or audible, music allows me to drown everything out until I am able to find serenity.Life, for humans, is a clamorous exchange of sights, sounds, and the frank inability to respect the very thing that allows for an all-encompassing of existence.My personal discovery of silence (and the continuation to find similar/better circumstances) happened on the morning after the biggest snowstorm of my childhood; not an animal, person, nor car was in sight. This very method brought me an indescribable peace, the closest thing to visual and verbal silence, granted me the opportunity of appreciation and self-understanding.For a quiet person, like myself, I tend to keep many of my thoughts to myself. As I got to high school, I found myself to be almost mute at school, and I was just going through the motions every day. I was afraid of getting my feelings hurt, so I silenced myself. It turns out that this was the worst thing that I could have done. My own thoughts were eating away at me, and it was no escape from the everyday world, it was actually worse.However once I was able to open up to others, and ultimately be true to myself, the world became a much better place. I have learned that silence is OK in bundles, and an hour or two of silence at a time is very beneficial. As Mr. Kagge says, silence allows more openness to the world and finding love for life. I think that people often appreciate something more once they realize what their life would be like without it. Don\u2019t let silence get the best of you; use it to your advantage, but do not abuse it. We have voices for a reason and we have the right to use them. No one should silence your voice, and more importantly do not silence yourself.We heard from many students who live in New York City, and most of them said they had learned ways to find silence in the noise.AdvertisementSilence to me is the hum of the subway train that brings me clarity. Silence to me is the solitude I am able to have at church, when the lights are dim and my heart is open. Silence to me is walking along the river\u2019s edge, listening the waves crashing, the winds blowing, and the sky singing. Silence to me is in the darkest of nights, when I can\u2019t sleep and I hear my sister breathing, the neighbors laughing, and my heart pounding.I believe silence to be all of these things, even though they aren\u2019t places that are silent themselves. But they bring me a sense of clarity, peace, and serenity, which truly is silence to me. To me it\u2019s when you\u2019re able to think deeply and let your mind travel to unknown places waiting to be explored... As an ordinary 14 year old girl, I feel as if, even though I live in a city where people are awake at every hour of every day, I\u2019m still capable of having some clear understanding of my world and the world around me.Living in New York City is often seen as a chaotic and unbearably loud place to live, yet somehow it is the only place where I can feel at peace. A few years ago my parents bought a house in upstate New York. We have a nice small house tucked in the very back of a driveway with acres of trees surrounding us. The silence and tranquil feel could be one of the most relaxing aspects of our house, but every time I\u2019m up my anxiety spikes.... Silence for me, is not the same thing as being at peace. Hearing the loud voices of my angry neighbors or the traffic and cars out my window is what makes me feel at home, not the chirping of crickets or wind blowing. Though I love to spend the weekend upstate in the quiet countryside, I could never stay there for too long.Christina goes to school in New York City, but lives in New Jersey:Sometimes my sister complains about the chaos of the city, but I find these noises to be delicacies of an urban environment. Many people may disagree with me and feel they can only work in a quiet space. But to me, it\u2019s the best place to work. Being blunt, I don\u2019t cope with the distractions. I learn to adapt. One cannot get rid of all distractions. They are why I love the city and never want to leave it.I believe practicing silent meditation can open new doors in one\u2019s life. I think a good way of finding silence can be accessing a point far away from where you usually reside. For example, I go to Maine every summer. Maine can be a busy place in the town where I live, so I like to hike up to a spot where none of my friends know about. There is no visual or audible noise, and I love it. Find a place where you can\u2019t be distracted, and peace will follow.I am a firm supporter of practicing mindfulness: the psychological process of bringing one\u2019s attention to experiences occurring in the present moment. For as many moments as possible, take a second and absorb your surroundings. What do you hear? What do you see? What can you feel? Relax yourself. Remove yourself from the chaotic noise of this world. Listen to yourself. How are you feeling? Silence is needed every day to listen to your own body. It is needed to savor the present and enjoy the real world instead of the virtual world most of us are guilty of being constantly plugged into.Often people have a mind that is racing that they cannot turn off, and they have no time to sit down, take a deep breath and take in the surroundings rather than having them rush by. They might find it hard to achieve what I call inner calmness, which is a type of silence that allows you to close the door and take a walk inside of your head. It allows me to take a step inside of my mind, shut down my body, and take a tour around my thoughts and see what I\u2019ve been doing for the past length of time. It is a good time to reflect and organize things, as well as give my body a break, so I can relax inside myself without anything penetrating from the outside. I find this easy to achieve in almost any environment, and all I have to do is simply focus my eyes on a surface near me that has no detail, and then look at my thoughts.For me, literal silence is far more deafening than the world\u2019s ongoing commotion. Silence is mental, and only truly comes when we quiet our minds. The world stops for no one, and expecting the world to silence its noise is unrealistic and naive. Rather, we need to learn to establish a personal silence: a walk in the city, maybe a pair of headphones.I can see what Mr. Kagge means be saying that people, especially teenagers who are attached to their phones don\u2019t know what silence is. It\u2019s sad, but my parents would probably say the same about me. For me, most of the time I am doing something, and then when I have free time I am on my phone.After reading this, I started thinking about times when my phone isn\u2019t with me, and it\u2019s rare. At school, my phone\u2019s in my pocket. At home my phone is in front of my face. Even when I\u2019m sleeping, my phone is on my bed right next to me, waiting to be the first sound I wake up to. Phones provide endless distractions for our minds. I would really like to learn how to just be alone and quiet, without distractions.Life\u2019s distractions are only as loud as you make them. It\u2019s like a car accident, you can choose to stop and stare, or you can move on. You can place yourself in a loud environment or you could opt for a calmer, more silent place.... Closing the door and staying up later than everyone else is usually my remedy to a world too loud. But silence really isn\u2019t all about muting the world. I believe the best silence is when you walk outside, hearing the whisper of nature and nothing else. Once you stop thinking, glancing, talking so much, you start to see what\u2019s really around you. When the evening sunset you\u2019ve passed a thousand times while conversing with others becomes that much more vibrant when you\u2019re all alone. And you take a second, without speaking or moving, and you take it in. Hues of red, orange, and purple become a composition of red-purples, orange bleeding to a vibrant yellow peeking from behind tinted clouds. Yes, silence can open you up to the world, and the world to you.On the taxing journey to \u201csilence,\u201d one must find a place where they feel safe; somewhere where the eternal buzz of the city-life is drowned out by inner-peace. For me, this place is my home. I live on a quiet street in downtown Manhattan, so, for the most part, there is not much noise coming from the stereotypical road-rage of an NYC driver. And, most of all, what makes my home \u201csilent\u201d is the way it makes me feel. I know that when I am home I am safe next to the people I love most in this world: my family. Although \u201csilence,\u201d by dictionary definition, is the absence of noise, to me, it is wherever you feel most at peace, safe, and comfortable with yourself and surroundings.I think silence can be found anywhere, as long as someone is willing to let everything else go. Some examples of this is when someone is truly engulfed in a book, or at a really great movie in the theater, or just zoned out in class. All these actions can create a sense of peace in a person, and finding a sense of peace is why I think many people seek out silence. People will often say they need \u201cpeace and quiet\u201d when they feel overwhelmed. I don\u2019t think that literal peace and quiet is always what they seek, but rather just a moment to be able to forget about reality.I was reminded of my first visit to what would soon become my escape from life, a small local art museum a few miles from my house. I recall standing in utter amazement, eager to see all this place had to offer, before walking into a room towards the end of what was to be seen. The exhibit had all white walls and wooden floors with dozens of faces, made of clay, hung about the room in no particular way (or maybe, the most particular way). I stood for hours in that room carefully examining every wrinkle and eyebrow hair of each clay face, and to this day I am perplexed by my affliction to these easily-shattered people, but their image is forever burned in my mind.To me, a distraction merely means something that catches my attention, departing from something else or not. Almost everyone and everything seizes my attention. When I turn my head, I might see a vast grin on my friend\u2019s face twenty feet away, the rise of an eyebrow during a speech, or the shapes and forms a mouth makes when someone is talking directly to me. Nevertheless, my attention to specific, irrelevant things creates a distraction. So inevitably I must learn to cope with these distractions, and over the years I\u2019ve learned it is practically impossible. Try if you wish, but attempting to ignore the red scar across that guy\u2019s face is a deed almost no one can do. Although, there must be some way to stop it, right?To cope with those distractions it is necessary to embrace those distractions. If you keep trying to be pushing, pushing, pushing distractions away from you they will consume you. However if you embrace them, take them into consideration and are aware of them you will be able to dismiss them and turn them into white noise. Distractions are something you cannot terminate but they are something that you can cope with.The definition of silence to the \u201cGen Z\u201d teenager is found in snatches. It is a few minutes where we are not bombarded by bluelight and ads, a few moments not spent looking at other people\u2019s lives on a screen. We do not have the silence that other generations were given.I promise myself five undivided minutes per day. Five minutes where my brain is not scattered in a billion places. Five minutes where I am not forced to budget my time between tasks. Silence, to me, can look different depending on the day. Silence is me, walking through the barn on a Thursday, smelling dust and hay and leather and metal. Silence is me, sitting on my bed drinking coffee, my phone tucked somewhere else, muted. So, do not tell me that I don\u2019t know what silence looks like. I know what silence is. I have to fight for it sometimes - but I know what it is.Girls should have the right to play whatever sport they want just like guys should. I don\u2019t want to see girls get hurt in football or in hockey but I do believe they should have a chance to do whatever sport they want. I think it would be interesting to see girls play against guys in sports like football and hockey.All sports should be equal. There is no exception to equality. It is not as if the women are being forced to play sports with men, this is something they are signing up for. There is no reason why they would be in more harm than if it was just one gender. If there is a constant push for equality then both sides need to learn to take it. I think that the New York City Marathon is a great example of how things should be done. There is a push on more equality that is crucial to the equality for all. It is an example of change for the better, they recognized something wrong and made it something good.The opposing argument that women are not the same as men, they have different strengths and weaknesses. But as an athlete isn\u2019t that what you want? A good competitor? If a man or a women is complaining about having to compete against someone of another gender, then they should take a moment and look in the mirror and see if they are really the athlete they think they are.I think that women and men should be given the chance or opportunity to compete against the opposite sex. People shouldn\u2019t have to stay confined to their own gender\u2019s sports. I think that all sports should be coed, for females have the same athletic capabilities as males. Our genders don\u2019t define how well or how capable we are at something.Yes! Just because you are a female or male it doesn\u2019t define how aggressive or strong you are. So yes coed sports should be a thing from now on.There are some sports that probably should not be coed. I say this because some sports may be a little too much for females. But if a female wants to play the sport, I think she should be able to play it. The sports that may be too much for females are football, basketball, and wrestling.I believe that some sports should be and shouldn\u2019t be coed. Some sports that shouldn\u2019t be coed is football because most of the guys always work out and gain weight. Another sport that shouldn\u2019t be coed is swimming because some men might act inappropriate. For example, women might feel uncomfortable around men. Some sports that should be coed is soccer, volleyball and track because there isn\u2019t like any real physical touching involved and you just pass the ball and you aren\u2019t allowed to grab people._________Both the child and the adult are caged, yet the doors to the child\u2019s cage are open, and birds fly in and out freely. New birds displace the old ones, as there is only so much space in this cage. In the adult\u2019s cage, the same two birds are trapped and unmoving. The birds to me represent beliefs and judgments. Children and adults are both exposed to ideas, but children are more open-minded. They allow thoughts to flow rather than shutting them off by closing the cage doors of their mind and trapping certain opinions and judgments. Children are exposed to a greater range of stimuli, as they are not in a specialised profession as many adults are, so have a greater breadth in their thoughts.Adults may feel as though they have established their view on the world, so shut themselves off from thoughts outside their cage, referring instead to the same beliefs perched on their head. Adults are therefore more likely to harbour stereotypes, and to dislike change. I also found it interesting that the child is looking up at the adult. As children, we aspire to be like adults, to be mature. Yet to us, looking at the picture from the outside, the child looks so much happier, freer than the caged adult, so it seems like the child is almost shocked at how different their future looks. The adult, meanwhile, stares blankly ahead, reflecting in his expression the monotony of his thoughts.I believe this illustration was about how a child\u2019s mind is free and simple because they do not have much worry. This compared to the adult\u2019s mind which is complex and caged because they have worry and responsibility to think about and cannot just do whatever they wish to do. I feel like when I was younger, I wondered about everything and my mind was free as compared to now where I overthink everything and worry about everything. I believe the article compared a child\u2019s mind vs. an adult\u2019s mind.I think that this image represents how an adult\u2019s mind is stabilized compared to a child\u2019s mind that has different thoughts rushing through. It\u2019s easy for an adult to make a decision because they have a stabilized mindset. They can think faster. They can think what is good for them. Adults are also matured, which makes them limited to the choices they can make. On other hand a child has a mindset that is unmatured and is not stabilized. They have a thousand thoughts rushing through their minds. They have no limits. They can behave however they want too.When I was a small kid, all of my mistakes were excused. Now I am a teenager, I do one mistake on my assignment, my grades drop, my parents get angry at me because they have high expectation. This is the difference between childhood and a young adult. As I grow up my decisions affect my life.Thinking outside the box, I believe almost that the cages outwardly express the mind, whether it be the mind of an adult, or the mind of a child. I finally came to this conclusion after I realized that the child\u2019s doors are open, and the adult\u2019s are closed.This led me to ask myself, \u201cWhat do children have that are open that adults also possess but in a closed manner?\u201dAs we all grow up in this society filled with new news, new norms, new expectations, it is easy to see the majority of the younger youth is more easily swayed than the older, more experienced adults. In today\u2019s society, this is exceptionally clear, through LGBTQ rights, BLM, and especially the presidency.The younger youth is more prone to have an open mind, more prone to foster the capability of change. In the adult\u2019s cage, it is clear to see the old birds sitting in the cage, not changing, just like the adult\u2019s views. The child, however, has open doors, with birds flying in and flying out, symbolizing the importance of keeping an open mind, and not letting one view sway you into a life of closed doors.Leave your doors open. Let yourself wander into the beauty of the differences in our society. After all, you don\u2019t want two old rotting birds when you could have hundreds - or even thousands - of new birds, influencing your thoughts in a way that will leave you thinking, \u201cWhy did I ever leave my cage closed in the first place?\u201d_________Many wrote about their everyday anxieties, like forgetting to do their homework, disappointing their parents and fitting in at school. They also wrote about bigger fears, like terrorism and mass shootings, that now seem to consume the news. All came to the conclusion that, no matter the fear, dealing with it is the key. Readers had this advice for easing worries:Fear is a part of life. It can help keep us safe and reminds us that we are human and have our own limitations. It only becomes destructive if we give it too much power and let it consume our energy. If we try to forcefully subdue fear, it only feeds on the attention. However, if we accept fear as a part of life, are mindful of its presence, and gently shift our attention to more productive items, then not only do we overcome this inhibiting fear and move on with our lives, we become mentally and emotionally stronger.If you show fear, it is portrayed as weak. However everyone has fear; no matter who you are, there is always something that can make you afraid. For some that could be fear of the future, for others it could be fear of spiders. Fear is such a wide range word that could mean different things to different people. I understand why someone who is strong and powerful would deny this statement, for so long the world has portrayed fear as something that only cowards have. But the truth is, fear is a part of life and it reminds us that we are human and we have limitations to our actions.I think that people should push themselves to get over fears and phobias because every fear you have or phobia holds you back from doing something in life. For example if you are scared of heights and never go to the top of a building in the city you will never get to see all the city lights. If you are scared of water you may never go snorkeling. Which could both be great experiences in life but fears can hold you back. So I think people should work to overcome them \u2014 if you are scared of water you don\u2019t have to jump into the ocean, if you are scared of public speaking you don\u2019t have to talk to a million people at first. No one knows you better than you. Only you knows what pace you should go at if you are scared of water; don\u2019t jump in the ocean to get over your fear go to a local pool and only go 3 feet until you are ready to go to the ocean.The way I handle fear is usually getting somebody to keep me company so I know I\u2019m not alone and so I can feel more safe. I get so stressed when I have too many things to do and I know I can\u2019t do them all. This sometimes gets in the way of my goals because I stress too much to the point where I just don\u2019t do what I need to do. After reading this article I can learn to just calm down when I\u2019m stressing too much because now I know it\u2019s just my brain stressing me out. I think improving my phobias will improve my life because it will be less stressful and I will have more peace in my life._________Race down city streets with a crew of skaters as they weave in and out of traffic, pedestrians and intersections without stopping.I stood in awe above the view of the sun setting on the world below, having temporarily satisfied my inexplicable attraction to heights. My friend yelled what I\u2019m sure were words at me from the base of the tower. But all of life outside where I was standing was a blur and to be dealt with at a later date, because right then, I was awake, and there\u2019s no way I would take that for granted.YEAH!!!... when it comes to risk taking ... I have a lot of stories... I am 15 and accidentally saw this post, so I decided to write on it :)..Most of the risks I do is parkour. I live in a vast Sarasota community with big buildings, and lots of downtown areas where I go with friends. Last Christmas, we decided to put on a show. We knew that there would be LOTS of people out in the streets shopping, and using Google Maps, we carefully planned out all the paths we would take that would make people down below see us, and hold their breath during the tricks. There were 7 of us. Me, 5 boys and a girl, who is a pro at this exotic sport :)).The day of the performance had come, and a couple times at night we went there and repeated the route to get used to it and perform well for the public. To stay anonymous, we put on masks, hoodies, and black ninja like outfits. Starting off on the roof of a supermarket, we all stood on the edge looking down at the crowd below us, trembling with fear. This was the first trick: we held hands, and back flipped, all together... (we practiced this like a HUNDRED times if not more). I heard a shout during the backwards air roll and a scream of excitement from the crowd... We then started running, the crowd followed us. Jumped to the first building, flipped, then the next one, then we split up and came back together at the last building, performing another group flip. I was exhausted, only to hear police sirens in the distance... time to run......Personally, I absolutely love the feeling of risk-taking. Being adventurous makes me feel an adrenaline rush and I get a sense of euphoria from it. I think that people generally are more willing to do something out of their comfort zone with their friends opposed to without. In many cases, peer pressure makes people feel like they have to do things for their friends or else they become a \u201clet-down.\u201d But I believe that not all peer pressure is bad. If they are really your friends, they will motivate you towards improving yourself and push you to get to where you\u2019ve always wanted to be.Some people enjoy jumping over pools of sharks with a bike while others take risks by cheating on a test. Both make your heart rate increase but in very different ways. I enjoy being adventurous and stepping out of my comfort zone but I tend to not go too far. I am very afraid of free falling and heights when I have to land in something within a high distance. I can do heights on ski lifts and overlooking a city, but I don\u2019t like jumping off cliffs into water or riding a bike over a jump. If my friends were to do something physically I would see how they turned out and then decide.... My brother will jump off cliffs, bridges, anything. He is not bothered by anything while I\u2019m the opposite. I will give it a try if, and will probably love it but getting myself to do it is the problem. On another hand, people can\u2019t take risks socially, but I can. I will go up to anyone on the phone, in the mall or even on the streets.I am a risk-taker with certain things but I am not a physical risk-taker. The biggest risk I have ever taken was rock climbing and it was okay but I wouldn\u2019t do anything more dangerous. I can bond with being scared with others and have actually made a few friends because of our bonding of being afraid. Although I have made friends from it, I wouldn\u2019t just do something because my friends do it. If my friends asked me to jump off a bridge with them, I wouldn\u2019t!_________1. Nikes2. Air Jordans3. Converse4. Vans5. YeezysThere were also those with more expensive tastes for shoes like Christian Louboutins and Balenciagas.I consider myself a sneakerhead. I currently have dozens of pairs, primarily Nike, but not exclusively. My obsession started at a very young age, but grew exponentially as I could afford of buy multiple pairs.My style is more Jerry Seinfeld than hypebeast, so I don\u2019t go all in on the total look, but I will rick anything I think I can pull off. Kind of like Seinfeld, I have a fondness for neutral sneakers with cool details.I\u2019m not going to stand in line for days for a pair, but I am willing to seek out something that\u2019s limited-edition or rare if I like the shoe.my favorite kind of shoe is jordan and kobes and what i look for in kobes is how good will they be for actually playin basket ball in. for example i look at the grip on the bottom and if i think it woll play well for me plus it looks good im going to buy it. and for normal shoes that i dont play in i mainly look for confort and style and color. i generally just look for a style shoe that i likeMY favorite kind of sneakers are Air Jordan numbers 1 through 14. These are my preferred sneaker because they all have the same quality comfort design. Most Jordan sneakers do not have the outrageous colorways that make it hard to match with all outfits. Before buying shoe that is the fist thing i think of because i do not want to purchase a shoe i cannot match with. I would consider myself a sneaker fanatic because i have many different shoes by different brand that are different styles.First off, I wish to say sorry to all those sneaker fanatics out there because I am not one. When looking at any shoes, sneakers in specific, I just look to see if they would match everything and if they are comfortable. I like Nike shoes just because they are comfortable for my feet while doing all sorts of activities. My way of thinking if the shoe is comfortable and long lasting, does the brand matter?_________Last year in 9th grade, we had an assignment in English. We were told to write a poem about Asheville, which is where I live, and later perform it for the class. The poem did not have any expectations, just that it would connect to Asheville, and it was well written and insightful. I personally was very excited to write a poem as an assignment. I had written poetry before and I really enjoy reading and writing it. Our teacher told us that we would perform these poetries for the class, and then a few of the students from each class would be voted to perform them at a event for school. I was asked to perform for the school event, and I accepted. I was very nervous, but at the same time, very excited to be voted for my poem. Each student would go up on the stage and perform. I was amazed at all the different poems, each unique and really well written; connecting the poems to Asheville in different ways. I really like how poetry is a creative way of expressing thoughts and ideas, there are no expectations or limits to what you write. Personally, it is one of my favorite types of writing.Poetry is quite a big part of my life. I enjoy reading it at times, but most importantly, I love writing my own poetry. My favorite type of poetry is the limerick. They\u2019re easy to come up with, and they\u2019re almost like short, little snippets of a poem. Because they\u2019re so easy to write, you can write many at a time, within a few minutes. Limericks follow an A-A-B-B-A pattern, where the first two lines rhyme, the next two lines rhyme with each other, and the last line rhymes with the first two. They\u2019re fun to listen to, as poems are also like little songs.I have barely started writing poetry, though I only have about three done. I used to not like poetry as much because it was difficult to understand; however, now I can pick apart and analyze parts of the poem far better than when I was younger. Now, I love poetry for the meanings behind the words and the overall message of the poem I\u2019m reading. My poems have so far varied on subjects and messages. I write and convey the message I am thinking or have been thinking for awhile, so they are mostly just random bits of my thoughts.I am not big on poetry and it\u2019s not a common factor in my life. When I was in elementary, I used to recite poems and write my own. I was a good writer and my poems were very descriptive, but I wasn\u2019t all that interested in poetry. I don\u2019t really have a favorite poem but sometimes, I read motivational poems to get my day started.Poetry doesn\u2019t play a major role in my life, if at all. I don\u2019t regularly read poetry because I find difficulty in understanding it. Although, my all-time favorite poem is Robert Frost\u2019s, \u201cNothing Gold Can Stay.\u201d I think that this poem in particular has a beautiful meaning and message behind it.I learned quite a bit in this article. I had no idea there was such thing as Poet Laureate, and then I learn that there is a Youth Poet Laureate. I hadn\u2019t heard of Ms. Gorman until today, but she seems interesting.... I usually listen/read poetry when I need something to distract me from something that I can\u2019t fix or when I don\u2019t have a book to read. One of my two favorite authors is Maggie Stiefvater. She has a poetical way of telling her stories. My favorite poet is much easier to choose than my favorite poems, that probably being William Shakespeare or Gwendolyn Brooks. I don\u2019t generally write poetry, but I have written it before for a school assignment.The school assignment was way back into my elementary days, and we were to make a poetry portfolio. We made different types of poems. I remember one poem in particular. It was shaped into a heart, but I can\u2019t remember the exact words. I remember the meaning behind it, it was about my family and how I never want them to fall apart. At the time, my parents were arguing a lot and on many occasions, I heard the threats of divorce thrown between the two. They thought that I wouldn\u2019t listen, they thought I was fast asleep. My family is still together, and there are no longer fights that included threats whatsoever, we are still happy together.I have recently begun to write poetry. It has become an easy way for me to write down how I feel about something or events that are happening in my world that cannot be described in normal words. One word in poetry can have so many different meanings. That is what I love about poetry, the many different interpretations behind a single word or phrase. My poems describe different subjects from world events to issues in my personal life. My best written poems happen when I am not trying to write one and at the most random times._________I\u2019m not surprised that the sense of smell shifts throughout the day - I work at a coffee shop and even though I\u2019m brewing pots in the early morning, I can hardly smell them, but if I close the shop, I can distinguish any flavor, no matter how subtle. For me, certain scents trigger strong flashbacks that can almost overwhelm me - any time I smell freshly vacuumed carpet, a certain cologne, fresh birch mulch, and sequoia sap I can see myself in a specific place at a specific time, and I can hear and see (and, of course, smell) exactly what was happening around me at a particular moment accompanied by the scent.Yes because I never really thought about how your sense of smell changes. I believe my sense of smell is best at night due to me being able to sit on my porch and smell the flowers. My sense of smell helps me identify and describe things. It also reminds me of either good or bad times. For instance, when I smell lavender, I think of a time where my grandmother was alive and well. And if I smell smoke, I think of emergencies. My sense of smell helps me identify, remember, and is better during night.Hasn\u2019t there been a study that shows that women have a better sense of smell than men? In all my personal relationships - father, boyfriends, husbands, colleagues - the men could not smell what I could. And that was independent of the time of day.I was not surprised at all to learn that our noses are more sensitive during different times of the day. I personally think my sense of smell is strongest in late afternoons/early evenings. Personally, some smells trigger certain memories for me. For example, whenever I smell something like a freshly made bubble tea drink, it always reminds me of the time I spent in Taiwan last year. I was part of a missionary trip called ADVENT Taiwan 2017, and we got to teach the poorer kids overseas things like English pronunciation, vocabulary, and Christianity. Every so often, we would get rewarded with bubble tea drinks after a long day\u2019s worth of work and effort.Now, whenever I get a hint of the same smell, I remember the beautiful faces of the children of Taiwan who\u2019ve helped shape who I am today.I am really surprised when I heard that nose is sensitive in different times. I used to think that senses work at same pace, with same power in every second of life. While reading this article, I realized that my sense of smell may be fluctuating while it\u2019s working. I particularly think that when I have my favorite foods near me it may be the strongest. My sense of smell really helps me in my daily schedule. I am a vegetarian, I need to take care that I don\u2019t have any meat contents in my food before buying the product._________National parks are made to preserve land and prevent *exactly* this, from commercial interests taking them over and tearing them down for profit. I can\u2019t even believe this is happening, what has this world come to when we must destroy what others have put up for our own personal gain? That sounds like some dystopian \u201clord of the flies\u201d situation, destroying and stealing for personal benefit. The growing interest of commercial entities on natural and preserved land has done nothing but grow exponentially, and why wouldn\u2019t they? Nature reserves are like a huge, juicy grape on a vine that has nearly been plucked clean, and the company would rather have them than keep eating the dried up grapes along the rest of the vine; they just have to convince the vineyard to give the grapes to them to consume rather than saving them for the fine wine that is the experience of nature for those down the line.I think that yes the government should protect national monuments and I don\u2019t think that someone would remove a national monument or make it smaller. I think with doing this the land that had been protected for whatever reason like it being a burial ground for native americans or endangered species have inhabited it would be put at high risk. People will exploit the land in some way whether that is building something commercial on the land to further profit or just becoming reckless with what is still protected by the government. I think that if Trump was to make national monuments smaller that people would take that as they are not important and do not serve a purpose when in fact they do and harm or disrespect could be done to the land or monument so I do not think that the places that are protected by the government because they are a monument should be affected.National monuments are places or things within our nation that we all cherish and admire. They are the natural or manmade beauties that the Earth has given to our nation and we should do everything to preserve the national monuments. The posterity of the nation deserves to see the monuments just like those who came before them. By allowing the protection of monuments to go away only degrades America\u2019s past achievements by figures like Teddy Roosevelt but also the cultural history of the United States.... Even shrinking the area of a national monument like the Bears Ears monument in Utah can have adverse effects. If the surrounding area is not protected, the ecosystem and environment may collapse which defiles the beauty of the location. Though it may seem appealing to remove federal protections of monuments, I believe that preserving the beauty of America is more valuable than budget cuts in the name of politics. At the minimum, the government should not change the current policy of monuments and refrain from devastating cuts.I strongly believe Trump should not be allowed to shrink or demolish national monuments. The national monuments have significant meaning to individual people, cultures as well as having historic importance. To shrink or take away a national monument and convert them into commercial use is absurd. People have already taken over so much of this earth and having places such as Bears Ears to enjoy the beauty of nature is wonderful. There is no need to put there, for example, a mall. I believe he can choose not to add any more in his time, but he should not take the existing ones away.See More \u00bbGo to Home Page \u00bb"}
{"Headline": "The Upside of Being Ruled by the Five Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. But what if that\u2019s not so bad?For a year and a half \u2014 and more urgently for much of the last month \u2014 I have warned of the growing economic, social and political power held by the five largest American tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.That\u2019s not ridiculous. Over the last few weeks, several scholars said there are good reasons to be sanguine about our new tech overlords. Below, I compiled their best arguments about the bright side of the Five.Tech is inherently messy. The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them. This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow. The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo \u2014 and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides.One benefit of having five giant companies in charge of today\u2019s tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems.Consider Russian propaganda. People have worried about the internet\u2019s capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades \u2014 from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism \u2014 the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation. But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies \u2014 one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs \u2014 it was never conceivable to limit that era\u2019s equivalent of fake news.Today, it suddenly is. Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control.This does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates \u2014 and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression. But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms.\u201cThis is new stuff everybody is dealing with \u2014 it\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of \u201cBig Is Beautiful,\u201d a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies. (The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.) \u201cSo when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier. You\u2019ve got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor.\u201dOver the last few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome \u2014 so why was I including their company in that group?This dynamic \u2014 where each company competes mightily against the others \u2014 suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d with Mr. Atkinson. \u201cAs long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then what\u2019s to complain about?\u201dYou can see this in their product road maps. None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control \u2014 for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop.At the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies. And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways \u2014 with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics.\u201cSo, why pre-emptively say that maybe we\u2019ll be harmed in the future \u2014 that in 2030 they\u2019ll jack up their prices or something?\u201d Mr. Lind asked. \u201cWell, deal with that as it comes.\u201dThe Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale. Thanks to economic dynamics like network effects \u2014 where a product, like Facebook, gets more useful as more people use it \u2014 it was perhaps inevitable that we would see the rise of a handful of large companies take control of much of the modern tech business.I don\u2019t mean this list to get the Five off the hook. How we deal with their efforts to capture more power over the economy and our society is perhaps the next great question facing America. But this is a complex problem precisely because there are both advantages and disadvantages to their size.As I said, tech is messy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A World War II \u2018Dirty Dozen\u2019 Watch Brand Is Back", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 It may not seem entirely rational to introduce a watch brand in today\u2019s highly competitive market, but Don Cochrane is not a man driven by reason.Mr. Cochrane never knew his great-grandfather, but he was close to his grandparents Henry and Peggy Lazarus (she was Mr. Lyons\u2019s daughter). \u201cMy grandfather had been in the business since 1938, and we used to draw watches together,\u201d he said, adding with a laugh, \u201cThough obviously as a child drawing a circle and putting hands on it is pretty straightforward.\u201dTwo years ago, when his grandmother died about six months short of her 100th birthday, he had the idea to revive the brand.\u201cI was at work, thinking about my grandmother\u2019s life and Vertex,\u201d recalled Mr. Cochrane, who has a background in advertising and previously worked for Tesla, VistaJet and Aston Martin. \u201cI Googled it and started learning all this really amazing stuff. It was a bit of an epiphany.\u201dVertex, he found, was one of the \u201cdirty dozen,\u201d the nickname that the watch community uses for the 12 companies that the British military leadership authorized to produce timepieces for World War II troops. At the time, the watches were called W.W.W. \u2014 for Watch, Wristlet, Waterproof \u2014 and some are highly collectible today, like the Omega, IWC and Jaeger-LeCoultre designs.Vertex was the only British brand in the group, although its movements were made in Switzerland.Mr. Cochrane said the narrative was perfect for a heritage watch brand \u2014 \u201cThese watches got beaten up and shot at,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were used to navigate across enemy territory, for when to drop bombs or block that bridge.\u201d \u2014 but he still felt he needed something that was, as he said, \u201cemotionally different.\u201dHe decided to build Vertex around a community, initially 60 people whom Mr. Cochrane personally invited to become Vertex owners. Forty-five accepted, and each was given five names to invite, growing the brand in turn. Sales are primarily limited to invitees, although anyone who owns one of the original W.W.W. Vertex models also can buy a new watch.\u201cSelling to retailers and customers is cool, but I think people want to feel more connected with brands now,\u201d Mr. Cochrane said. \u201cI know all of our owners, and they\u2019re involved with the brand in some shape or form.\u201d He also envisions holding events, like the one scheduled in New York this week, where owners and potential owners can meet and see the watch.When Mr. Cochrane actually began working on the revival in mid-2015, his first step was to buy back the Vertex trademark \u2014 it had become the property of Columbia, the outdoor clothing and sportswear company \u2014 and, after remortgaging his house and borrowing from family members, he then set out to find Swiss partners. Eventually, he selected Roventa Henex to make the watches, and that company decided to use movements from ETA, the Swatch Group subsidiary.As for the inaugural design, the steel Vertex M100 is true to its \u201cdirty dozen\u201d predecessor, including the dial\u2019s pheon, or broad arrow, a heraldic symbol used on all sorts of British government items from uniforms to ornaments. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be on the watch,\u201d Mr. Cochrane said, adding that the government no longer used the emblem. \u201cBut it was important to have that continuation.\u201dThe most notable differences are that the new case is 40 millimeters (the original was 35 millimeters) and the dial numbers are molded from SuperLuminova for easy reading in the dark. The watch also features an ETA 7001 movement, water resistance to a depth of more than 325 feet, a 42-hour power reserve and delivery in a Pelican box, the industrial-grade, foam-packed case beloved by the military and film crews. It comes with two straps, black leather and gray NATO, and is priced at 2,500 pounds ($3,320).Only 600 watches have been made, and more than 200 have sold since the M100 became available in May. \u201cWhen they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone \u2014 and that will pay for the next watch,\u201d said Mr. Cochrane, who hinted at the appearance of a dive or dress watch next summer.The M100\u2019s owners include collectors as well as engineers, entrepreneurs, musicians, athletes, the designer behind all of Pink Floyd\u2019s album art and a Victoria\u2019s Secret model.One is the Earl of Mornington, who was a host of Vertex\u2019s inaugural event in London in March. He said he was intrigued by Mr. Cochrane\u2019s family connection to the brand and the \u201cunusual sequence of events that led to it being on my wrist.\u201dMr. Cochrane said the comments made him \u201cannoyed and sad,\u201d and he countered with examples of top-end watches that are accessible only by the ultrarich. \u201cI think money is elitist,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have lots of it, you can have whatever you want.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Uncounted", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "\n  The Razzos lived in the Woods, a bucolic neighborhood on the banks of the Tigris, where marble and stucco villas sprawled amid forests of eucalyptus, chinar and pine. Cafes and restaurants lined the riverbanks, but ever since the city fell to ISIS the previous year, Basim and Mayada had preferred to entertain at home. They would set up chairs poolside and put kebabs on the grill, and Mayada would serve pizza or Chinese fried rice, all in an effort to maintain life as they\u2019d always known it. Their son, Yahya, had abandoned his studies at Mosul University and fled for Erbil, and they had not seen him since; those who left when ISIS took over could re-enter the caliphate, but once there, they could not leave \u2014 an impasse that stranded people wherever they found themselves. Birthdays, weddings and graduations came and went, the celebrations stockpiled for that impossibly distant moment: liberation.\n\n  Next door to Basim\u2019s home stood the nearly identical home belonging to his brother, Mohannad, and his wife, Azza. They were almost certainly asleep at that hour, but Basim guessed that their 18-year-old son, Najib, was still up. A few months earlier, he was arrested by the ISIS religious police for wearing jeans and a T-shirt with English writing. They gave him 10 lashes and, as a further measure of humiliation, clipped his hair into a buzz cut. Now he spent most of his time indoors, usually on Facebook. \u201cSomeday it\u2019ll all be over,\u201d Najib had posted just a few days earlier. \u201cUntil that day, I\u2019ll hold on with all my strength.\u201d\n\n  Sometimes, after his parents locked up for the night, Najib would fish the key out of the cupboard and steal over to his uncle\u2019s house. Basim had the uncanny ability to make his nephew forget the darkness of their situation. He had a glass-half-full exuberance, grounded in the belief that every human life \u2014 every setback and success, every heartbreak and triumph \u2014 is written by the 40th day in the womb. Basim was not a particularly religious man, but that small article of faith underpinned what seemed to him an ineluctable truth, even in wartime Iraq: Everything happens for a reason. It was an assurance he offered everyone; Yahya had lost a year\u2019s worth of education, but in exile he had met, and proposed to, the love of his life. \u201cYou see?\u201d Basim would tell Mayada. \u201cYou see? That\u2019s fate.\u201d\n\n  Basim had felt this way for as long as he could remember. A 56-year-old account manager at Huawei, the Chinese multinational telecommunications company, he studied engineering in the 1980s at Western Michigan University. He and Mayada lived in Portage, Mich., in a tiny one-bedroom apartment that Mayada also used as the headquarters for her work as an Avon representative; she started small, offering makeup and skin cream to neighbors, but soon expanded sales to Kalamazoo and Comstock. Within a year, she\u2019d saved up enough to buy Basim a $700 Minolta camera. Basim came to rely on her ability to impose order on the strange and the mundane, to master effortlessly everything from Yahya\u2019s chemistry homework to the alien repartee of faculty picnics and Rotary clubs. It was fate. They had been married now for 33 years.\n\n  Around midnight, Basim heard a thump from the second floor. He peeked out of his office and saw a sliver of light under the door to the bedroom of his daughter, Tuqa. He called out for her to go to bed. At 21, Tuqa would often stay up late, and though Basim knew that he wasn\u2019t a good example himself and that the current conditions afforded little reason to be up early, he believed in the calming power of an early-to-bed, early-to-rise routine. He waited at the foot of the stairs, called out again, and the sliver went dark.\n\n  It was 1 a.m. when Basim finally shut down the computer and headed upstairs to bed. He settled in next to Mayada, who was fast asleep.\n\n  Some time later, he snapped awake. His shirt was drenched, and there was a strange taste \u2014 blood? \u2014 on his tongue. The air was thick and acrid. He looked up. He was in the bedroom, but the roof was nearly gone. He could see the night sky, the stars over Mosul. Basim reached out and found his legs pressed just inches from his face by what remained of his bed. He began to panic. He turned to his left, and there was a heap of rubble. \u201cMayada!\u201d he screamed. \u201cMayada!\u201d It was then that he noticed the silence. \u201cMayada!\u201d he shouted. \u201cTuqa!\u201d The bedroom walls were missing, leaving only the bare supports. He could see the dark outlines of treetops. He began to hear the faraway, unmistakable sound of a woman\u2019s voice. He cried out, and the voice shouted back, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d It was Azza, his sister-in-law, somewhere outside.\n\n  \u201cMayada\u2019s gone!\u201d he shouted.\n\n  \u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll find her!\u201d\n\n  \u201cNo, no, no, she\u2019s gone,\u201d he cried back. \u201cThey\u2019re all gone!\u201d\n\n  The clip is one of hundreds the coalition has released since the American-led war against the Islamic State began in August 2014. Also posted to Defense Department websites, they are presented as evidence of a military campaign unlike any other \u2014 precise, transparent and unyielding. In the effort to expel ISIS from Iraq and Syria, the coalition has conducted more than 27,500 strikes to date, deploying everything from Vietnam-era B-52 bombers to modern Predator drones. That overwhelming air power has made it possible for local ground troops to overcome heavy resistance and retake cities throughout the region. \u201cU.S. and coalition forces work very hard to be precise in airstrikes,\u201d Maj. Shane Huff, a spokesman for the Central Command, told us, and as a result \u201care conducting one of the most precise air campaigns in military history.\u201d\n\n  American military planners go to great lengths to distinguish today\u2019s precision strikes from the air raids of earlier wars, which were carried out with little or no regard for civilian casualties. They describe a target-selection process grounded in meticulously gathered intelligence, technological wizardry, carefully designed bureaucratic hurdles and extraordinary restraint. Intelligence analysts pass along proposed targets to \u201ctargeteers,\u201d who study 3-D computer models as they calibrate the angle of attack. A team of lawyers evaluates the plan, and \u2014 if all goes well \u2014 the process concludes with a strike so precise that it can, in some cases, destroy a room full of enemy fighters and leave the rest of the house intact.\n\n  The coalition usually announces an airstrike within a few days of its completion. It also publishes a monthly report assessing allegations of civilian casualties. Those it deems credible are generally explained as unavoidable accidents \u2014 a civilian vehicle drives into the target area moments after a bomb is dropped, for example. The coalition reports that since August 2014, it has killed tens of thousands of ISIS fighters and, according to our tally of its monthly summaries, 466 civilians in Iraq.\n\n  Yet until we raised his case, Basim\u2019s family was not among those counted. Mayada, Tuqa, Mohannad and Najib were four of an unknown number of Iraqi civilians whose deaths the coalition has placed in the \u201cISIS\u201d column. Estimates from Airwars and other nongovernmental organizations suggest that the civilian death toll is much higher, but the coalition disputes such figures, arguing that they are based not on specific intelligence but local news reports and testimony gathered from afar. When the coalition notes a mission irregularity or receives an allegation, it conducts its own inquiry and publishes a sentence-long analysis of its findings. But no one knows how many Iraqis have simply gone uncounted.\n\n  Our own reporting, conducted over 18 months, shows that the air war has been significantly less precise than the coalition claims. Between April 2016 and June 2017, we visited the sites of nearly 150 airstrikes across northern Iraq, not long after ISIS was evicted from them. We toured the wreckage; we interviewed hundreds of witnesses, survivors, family members, intelligence informants and local officials; we photographed bomb fragments, scoured local news sources, identified ISIS targets in the vicinity and mapped the destruction through satellite imagery. We also visited the American air base in Qatar where the coalition directs the air campaign. There, we were given access to the main operations floor and interviewed senior commanders, intelligence officials, legal advisers and civilian-casualty assessment experts. We provided their analysts with the coordinates and date ranges of every airstrike \u2014 103 in all \u2014 in three ISIS-controlled areas and examined their responses. The result is the first systematic, ground-based sample of airstrikes in Iraq since this latest military action began in 2014.\n\n  We found that one in five of the coalition strikes we identified resulted in civilian death, a rate more than 31 times that acknowledged by the coalition. It is at such a distance from official claims that, in terms of civilian deaths, this may be the least transparent war in recent American history. Our reporting, moreover, revealed a consistent failure by the coalition to investigate claims properly or to keep records that make it possible to investigate the claims at all. While some of the civilian deaths we documented were a result of proximity to a legitimate ISIS target, many others appear to be the result simply of flawed or outdated intelligence that conflated civilians with combatants. In this system, Iraqis are considered guilty until proved innocent. Those who survive the strikes, people like Basim Razzo, remain marked as possible ISIS sympathizers, with no discernible path to clear their names.\n\n  In the hospital, Basim was hazily aware of nurses and orderlies, but it was not until morning that he saw a familiar face. Mayada\u2019s brother placed a hand on his shoulder. When Basim asked who in his home survived, he was told: nobody. The blast killed Mayada and Tuqa instantly. A second strike hit next door, and Mohannad and Najib were also dead. Only Azza, Najib\u2019s mother, was alive, because the explosion had flung her through a second-story window.\n\n  With his hip shattered, his pubic bone broken and his back and the sole of his left foot studded with shrapnel, Basim would need major surgery. But no hospital in Mosul, or anywhere in the caliphate, had the personnel or equipment to carry it out. The only hope was to apply for permission to temporarily leave ISIS territory, which required approval from the surprisingly complex ISIS bureaucracy. A friend put in the paperwork, but the ISIS representative denied the request. \u201cLet him die,\u201d he told Basim\u2019s friend. \u201cThere were four martyrs. Let him be the fifth.\u201d\n\n  Basim was moved to his parents\u2019 home on the city\u2019s southern side. For two days, close friends and family members streamed in, but he hardly registered their presence. On the third day, he found himself able to sit up, and he began flipping through the pictures on his phone. One of the last was taken the evening before the attack: Tuqa grinning in the kitchen, clutching a sparkler. For the first time, he began to sob. Then he gathered himself and opened Facebook. \u201cIn the middle of the night,\u201d he wrote, \u201ccoalition airplanes targeted two houses occupied by innocent civilians. Is this technology? This barbarian attack cost me the lives of my wife, daughter, brother and nephew.\u201d\n\n  Suddenly, it was as if the whole city knew, and messages poured in. Word filtered to local sheikhs, imams and businessmen. Basim\u2019s own fate was discussed. Favors were called in, and a few weeks later, ISIS granted Basim permission to leave the caliphate. There was one condition: He must put up the deed to some of his family\u2019s property, which would be seized if he did not return. Basim feared traveling to Baghdad; whoever targeted his home might still believe him to be part of ISIS. Turkey seemed like his only option, and the only way to get there was to cross the breadth of Islamic State lands, through Syria.\n\n  For Basim, the next few days passed in a haze. A hired driver lowered him into a GMC Suburban, its rear seats removed to accommodate the mattress on which he reclined. They drove through the Islamic State countryside, past shabby villages and streams strewn with trash. In the afternoon, they reached Mount Sinjar, where a year earlier, Yazidi women were carted off by ISIS and sold into slavery. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have to go fast now,\u201d the driver said, revving up the engine until they were tearing through at 100 m.p.h. Yazidi guerrillas were now taking refuge in the highlands and were known to take aim at the traffic down below.\n\n  The country opened up into miles and miles of featureless desert. Basim could not distinguish the small Syrian towns they passed but was aware of reaching Raqqa, the capital of the caliphate, and being lifted by a team of pedestrians and moved to a second vehicle. Soon a new driver was rushing Basim along darkened fields of wheat and cotton on narrow, bone-jarring roads. At times, the pain in his hip was unbearable. They stopped to spend the night, but he did not know where. At dawn, they set out again. After a while, the driver reached under his seat and produced a pack of cigarettes, forbidden in the caliphate. Basim was alarmed, but the driver began to laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in Free Syrian Army territory.\u201d\n\n  Before long, the traffic slowed, and they were weaving through streets crowded with refugees and homeless children and Syrian rebels. Basim was pushed across the border on a wheelchair. Waiting on the Turkish side, standing by an ambulance, was his son. Weeping, Yahya bent down to embrace his father. They had not seen each other in a year.\n\n  Basim spent the next two months in and out of a bed at the Special Orthopedic Hospital in Adana, Turkey. In the long hours between operations, when the painkillers afforded moments of lucidity, he tried to avoid ruminating on his loss. He refused to look at photos of his house, but occasionally at first, and then obsessively, he began replaying his and Mayada\u2019s actions in the days and weeks before the attack, searching for an explanation. Why was his family targeted? Some friends assumed that an ISIS convoy had been nearby, but the video showed nothing moving in the vicinity. What it did show was two direct hits. \u201cO.K., this is my house, and this is Mohannad\u2019s house,\u201d he recalled. \u201cOne rocket here, and one rocket there. It was not a mistake.\u201d\n\n  Basim\u2019s shock and grief were turning to anger. He knew the Americans; he had lived among them. He had always felt he understood them. He desperately wanted to understand why his family was taken from him. \u201cI decided,\u201d he said, \u201cto get justice.\u201d\n\n  In the 1970s, as Saddam Hussein consolidated power, Mosul\u2019s pluralism began to erode, but Basim would not be around long enough to witness its disappearance. He left for England in 1979 and soon made his way to the United States. Settling into Michigan life was easy. Basim bought a Mustang, figured out health insurance, barbecued, went to cocktail parties and dated a woman he met in England. This development alarmed his parents, who began to pester him to settle down and suggested that he marry his cousin Mayada. He resisted at first, but the allure of making a life with someone from back home proved too great. He married Mayada in 1982, in a small ceremony at his uncle\u2019s home in Ann Arbor, Mich., in front of a dozen people.\n\n  As the oldest son, Basim felt increasingly concerned about his aging parents, so in 1988, he and Mayada made the difficult decision to move back home permanently. The city they returned to had undergone a shocking transformation. The Iran-Iraq war was winding down, but at a cost of as many as half a million dead Iraqis. The political alternatives of Basim\u2019s youth were gone: Communism had long since been crushed, and Arab nationalism had lost its luster under Hussein\u2019s Baathist dictatorship.\n\n  Instead, people increasingly described their suffering in the language of faith. The culture was transforming before Basim\u2019s eyes; for the first time, Mayada wrapped herself in a head scarf. Not long after, small networks of religious fundamentalists began appearing in Mosul, preaching to communities devastated by war and United Nations sanctions.\n\n  Then, in 2003, the United States invaded. One night just a few months afterward, the Americans showed up at the Woods and took over a huge abandoned military barracks across the street from Basim\u2019s property. The next morning, they started cutting down trees. \u201cThey said, \u2018This is for our security,\u2019\u2009\u201d Basim recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Your security doesn\u2019t mean destruction of the forest.\u2019\u2009\u201d Walls of concrete and concertina wire started to appear amid the pine and chinar stands. The barracks became a Joint Coordination Center, or J.C.C., where American troops worked with local security forces. Basim came to know some of the Americans; once, before the center acquired internet access, he helped a soldier send email to his mother back home. Sometimes he would serve as an impromptu translator.\n\n  Across Iraq, the American invasion had plunged the country into chaos and spawned a nationalist resistance \u2014 and amid the social collapse, the zealots seized the pulpit. Al Qaeda in Iraq recruited from Mosul\u2019s shanty towns and outlying villages and from nearby provincial cities like Tal Afar. By 2007, sections of Mosul were in rebellion. By then, the Americans had expanded the mission of the J.C.C., adding a center where Iraqis could file compensation claims for the injury or death of a loved one at the hands of American forces.\n\n  Basim was transfixed. He\u2019d never seen an American talk this way. That night, he wrote an email. \u201cDear Dr. Richards, my name is Basim Razzo, and I am a citizen of Iraq,\u201d he began. He described how Iraqis had celebrated the overthrow of Hussein but then lost hope as the war progressed. \u201cRadical Islamists grew as a result of this war, and many ideas grew out of this war which we have never seen or heard before,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank you very much for your speech to enlighten the American public about this war.\u201d\n\n  Richards invited Basim to begin speaking to his classes over Skype, and a friendship blossomed. Years later, Richards saw Basim\u2019s Facebook post describing the attack and ran it through Google Translate. He and his wife spent hours messaging with Basim, trying to console him. In the end, Richards had signed off, \u201cThis American friend of yours, this American brother, sends you a virtual hug.\u201d\n\n  Now, as Basim lay in bed in the Special Orthopedic Hospital in Adana, he found his thoughts returning to the old Joint Coordination Center next to his house in Mosul and the condolence payments they used to offer. He knew that he would never recover the full extent of his losses, but he needed to clear his name. And he wanted an accounting. He decided that as soon as he recuperated, he would seek compensation. It was the only way he could imagine that an Iraqi civilian might sit face to face with a representative of the United States military.\n\n  Because the military still refused to consider the payments as compensation for loss, the system became capricious almost by design. Rebuilding a home could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, on top of several thousands\u2019 worth of furniture and other possessions. Medical bills could amount to thousands of dollars, especially for prostheses and rehabilitation. Losing government documents, like ID cards, could mean years of navigating a lumbering bureaucracy. The American condolence system addressed none of this. Payouts varied from one unit to the next, making the whole process seem arbitrary, mystifying or downright cruel to recipients: Payouts in Afghanistan, for example, ranged from as little as $124.13 in one civilian death to $15,000 in another.\n\n  In 2003, an activist from Northern California named Marla Ruzicka showed up in Baghdad determined to overhaul the system. She founded Civic, now known as the Center for Civilians in Conflict, and collected evidence of civilians killed in American military operations. She discovered not only that there were many more than expected but also that the assistance efforts for survivors were remarkably haphazard and arbitrary. Civic championed the cause in Washington and found an ally in Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont. In 2005, Ruzicka was killed by a suicide blast in Baghdad, but her efforts culminated in legislation that established a fund to provide Iraqi victims of American combat operations with nonmonetary assistance \u2014 medical care, home reconstruction \u2014 that served, in practice, as compensation.\n\n  When the Americans withdrew in 2011, however, all condolence programs went defunct, and they were not revived when the United States began the war against ISIS in 2014. The Marla Ruzicka Iraqi War Victims Fund itself \u2014 the only program specifically designed to aid war victims still in effect \u2014 has turned to other priorities and no longer provides assistance to civilian survivors of American combat operations. When we asked the State Department whether civilian victims of American airstrikes could turn to the Marla Fund for assistance, they were unable to provide an answer.\n\n  The two most recent military spending bills also authorized millions of dollars for condolence payments, but the Defense Department has failed to enact these provisions or even propose a plan for how it might disburse that money. In fact, in the course of our investigation, we learned that not a single person in Iraq or Syria has received a condolence payment for a civilian death since the war began in 2014. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t a process,\u201d a senior Central Command official told us. \u201cIt\u2019s not that anyone is against it; it just hasn\u2019t been done, so it\u2019s almost an aspirational requirement.\u201d\n\n  With Mosul and Raqqa now out of ISIS control, the coalition is \u201cnot going to spend a lot of time thinking about\u201d condolence payments, said Col. John Thomas, a spokesman for Central Command. \u201cWe\u2019re putting our efforts into community safety and returning refugees to some sort of home.\u201d While assisting civilian victims is no longer a military priority, some authorities appear to remain concerned about retaliation. About a year after the strike on Basim\u2019s house, his cousin Hussain Al-Rizzo, a systems-engineering professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, received a visit from an F.B.I. agent. The agent, he said, asked if the deaths of his relatives in an American airstrike made him in his \u201cheart of hearts sympathize with the bad guys.\u201d Hussain, who has lived in the United States since 1987, was stunned by the question. He said no.\n\n  Basim channeled his frustrations into proving his case to the Americans. With a quiet compulsiveness, he scoured the web, studying Google Earth images. He asked a niece, still living inside Mosul, to take clandestine photographs of the site, including close-ups of bomb fragments. He inventoried his lost possessions. He contacted everyone he\u2019d met who might have links to the American authorities: acquaintances from Michigan, his cousins in Arkansas, a relative who was an assistant professor at Yale University. His best hope was Sam Richards, the professor at Penn State: One of his former students was an adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, and she helped him get an appointment at the United States Embassy in Baghdad.\n\n  The consular officer, who spoke to us on the condition of anonymity, was moved. \u201cI have people coming in every day that lie to me, that come with these sob stories,\u201d the officer remembered telling him, \u201cbut I believe you.\u201d When Basim emerged onto the street, the rain was beating down, and a passer-by held out an umbrella as he hobbled to a taxi.\n\n  Two months passed, and Basim heard nothing. He wrote to the officer and reattached the report, asking for an update, but he received no reply. He tried again the next month and was told that his case had been \u201cforwarded.\u201d Then more silence.\n\n  We first met Basim not long after, in the spring of 2016, in a quiet cafe in Baghdad\u2019s Mansour district. Basim\u2019s cousin\u2019s wife, Zareena Grewal, the Yale professor, had written an Op-Ed in The New York Times about the attack. We had already been investigating the larger problem of civilian airstrikes for several months, so we contacted him to learn more about his story. Nearly half the country was still under ISIS control, and all along Mansour\u2019s palm-shaded sidewalks were the resplendent bursts of militia flags and posters of angelic-looking young men who had fallen on the front. Around the city, residents were living under a pall of suspicion that they were Islamic State sympathizers, a target for rogue militias and vengeful security forces, and Basim was eager to move north to Erbil. This was another reason he was determined to meet the Americans \u2014 not only for compensation but also for a letter attesting to their mistake, to certify that he did not belong to ISIS. \u201cWe\u2019ll hear something soon,\u201d Basim assured us.\n\n  But as the summer months came and went, still without word, Basim\u2019s confidence began to waver. In September, nearly a year after the airstrike, he tried emailing the embassy again. This time he received a response: \u201cThe recipient\u2019s mailbox is full and can\u2019t accept messages now. Please try resending this message later, or contact the recipient directly.\u201d (The consular officer later told us that when Basim\u2019s case was referred to a military attorney, the attorney replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no way to prove that the U.S. was involved.\u201d)\n\n  In November, we wrote to the coalition ourselves, explaining that we were reporters working on an article about Basim. We provided details about his family and his efforts to reach someone in authority and included a link to the YouTube video the coalition posted immediately after the strike. A public-affairs officer responded, \u201cThere is nothing in the historical log for 20 SEP 2015,\u201d the date the coalition had assigned to the strike video. Not long after, the video disappeared from the coalition\u2019s YouTube channel. We responded by providing the GPS coordinates of Basim\u2019s home, his emails to the State Department and an archived link to the YouTube video, which unlike the videos on the Pentagon\u2019s website allow for comments underneath \u2014 including those that Basim\u2019s family members left nearly a year before.\n\n  \u201cI will NEVER forget my innocent and dear cousins who died in this pointless airstrike,\u201d wrote Aisha Al-Rizzo, Tuqa\u2019s 16-year-old cousin from Arkansas.\n\n  \u201cYou are murderers,\u201d wrote Basim and Mohannad\u2019s cousin Hassan al-Razzo. \u201cYou kill innocents with cold blood and then start creating justification.\u201d\n\n  \u201cHow could you do that?\u201d wrote another relative. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a heart.\u201d\n\n  Over the coming weeks, one by one, the coalition began removing all the airstrike videos from YouTube.\nWhen ISIS left a mortar in Qaiyara\u2019s rail yard, a local informant passed on the coordinates for an airstrike. The strikes hit the rail yard (below), but ISIS had moved on. Instead, the homes of Salam al-Odeh and Aaz-Aldin Muhammad Alwan were hit. Salam\u2019s wife, Harbia, hung on until she reached the hospital, where she told her relatives what happened, then died of her injuries. A few weeks later, her son Musab died of his wounds, too. Of the eight people living in the two homes struck, only Rawa (below), who was 2, survived.\n  When we visited in May, several uniformed officials walked us through the steps they took to avoid civilian casualties. The process seemed staggeringly complex \u2014 the wall-to-wall monitors, the soup of acronyms, the army of lawyers \u2014 but the impressively choreographed operation was designed to answer two basic questions about each proposed strike: Is the proposed target actually ISIS? And will attacking this ISIS target harm civilians in the vicinity?\n\n  As we sat around a long conference table, the officers explained how this works in the best-case scenario, when the coalition has weeks or months to consider a target. Intelligence streams in from partner forces, informants on the ground, electronic surveillance and drone footage. Once the coalition decides a target is ISIS, analysts study the probability that striking it will kill civilians in the vicinity, often by poring over drone footage of patterns of civilian activity. The greater the likelihood of civilian harm, the more mitigating measures the coalition takes. If the target is near an office building, the attack might be rescheduled for nighttime. If the area is crowded, the coalition might adjust its weaponry to limit the blast radius. Sometimes aircraft will even fire a warning shot, allowing people to escape targeted facilities before the strike. An official showed us grainy night-vision footage of this technique in action: Warning shots hit the ground near a shed in Deir al-Zour, Syria, prompting a pair of white silhouettes to flee, one tripping and picking himself back up, as the cross hairs follow.\n\n  Once the targeting team establishes the risks, a commander must approve the strike, taking care to ensure that the potential civilian harm is not \u201cexcessive relative to the expected military advantage gained,\u201d as Lt. Col. Matthew King, the center\u2019s deputy legal adviser, explained.\n\n  After the bombs drop, the pilots and other officials evaluate the strike. Sometimes a civilian vehicle can suddenly appear in the video feed moments before impact. Or, through studying footage of the aftermath, they might detect signs of a civilian presence. Either way, such a report triggers an internal assessment in which the coalition determines, through a review of imagery and testimony from mission personnel, whether the civilian casualty report is credible. If so, the coalition makes refinements to avoid future civilian casualties, they told us, a process that might include reconsidering some bit of intelligence or identifying a flaw in the decision-making process.\n\n  Most of the civilian deaths acknowledged by the coalition emerge from this internal reporting process. Often, though, watchdogs or journalists bring allegations to the coalition, or officials learn about potential civilian deaths through social media. The coalition ultimately rejects a vast majority of such external reports. It will try to match the incident to a strike in its logs to determine whether it was indeed its aircraft that struck the location in question (the Iraqi Air Force also carries out strikes). If so, it then scours its drone footage, pilot videos, internal records and, when they believe it is warranted, social media and other open-source information for corroborating evidence. Each month, the coalition releases a report listing those allegations deemed credible, dismissing most of them on the grounds that coalition aircraft did not strike in the vicinity or that the reporter failed to provide sufficiently precise information about the time and place of the episode. (The coalition counts both aircraft and artillery attacks in its strike figures; we excluded artillery attacks.)\n\n  In the eyes of the coalition, its diligence on these matters points to a dispiriting truth about war: Supreme precision can reduce civilian casualties to a very small number, but that number will never reach zero. They speak of every one of the acknowledged deaths as tragic but utterly unavoidable. \u201cWe\u2019re not happy with it, and we\u2019re never going to be happy with it,\u201d said Thomas, the Central Command spokesman. \u201cBut we\u2019re pretty confident we do the best we can to try to limit these things.\u201d\n\n  The coalition sees the same problem but draws the opposite conclusion. In a September opinion article in Foreign Policy, with the headline \u201cReports of Civilian Casualties in the War Against ISIS Are Vastly Inflated,\u201d Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the coalition\u2019s former top commander, wrote: \u201cOur critics are unable to conduct the detailed assessments the coalition does. They arguably often rely on scant information phoned in or posted by questionable sources.\u201d\n\n  Counting civilian deaths in war zones has always been a difficult and controversial endeavor. The Iraq Body Count project, which sought to record civilian deaths after the 2003 invasion using techniques similar to Airwars, was flooded with criticism for both undercounting and overcounting. The Lancet, a medical journal, published studies based on surveys of Iraqi households that detractors alleged were not statistically sound. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have conducted ground investigations, but usually for only a handful of strikes at a time. Yet the coalition, the institution best placed to investigate civilian death claims, does not itself routinely dispatch investigators on the ground, citing access and security concerns, meaning there has not been such a rigorous ground investigation of this air war \u2014 or any American-led air campaign \u2014 since Human Rights Watch analyzed the civilian toll of the NATO bombing in Kosovo, a conflict that ended in 1999.\n\n  In our interview at the base, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of the United States Air Forces Central Command at Udeid, told us what was missing. \u201cGround truth, that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking for,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see what we see from altitude and pull in from other reports. Your perspective is talking to people on the ground.\u201d He paused, and then offered what he thought it would take to arrive at the truth: \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a combination of both.\u201d\nIn early 2016, an ISIS patrol forced its way into the home of Rafi al-Iraqi (below, with his children), demanding the family\u2019s cellphones. Sama (right), Rafi\u2019s 10-year-old daughter, burst into tears and produced her mother\u2019s phone, which contained negative messages about ISIS that she had recently sent to her sister in Erbil. Rafi and his wife were arrested and interrogated, but only he was released. When Rafi asked about his wife, he was told, \u201cWe\u2019ll bring her to you.\u201d Not long after, the family received her bullet-riddled body. Almost precisely a year later, at the height of the Mosul offensive, an airstrike leveled Rafi\u2019s house and two others next door. Only Rafi, his mother and his 12-year-old son, Mohammed (far left), survived.\n  The areas we visited had undergone intense attacks of all kinds over the previous two years: airstrikes, sniper fire, mortars, rockets, improvised explosive devices, demolitions by ISIS, demolitions by anti-ISIS vigilantes and more. Our approach required mapping each area, identifying the sites that had been struck from the air and excluding those damaged by Iraqi forces in close-quarters ground combat.\n\n  Finally, we determined who or what had been hit. In addition to interviewing hundreds of witnesses, we dug through the debris for bomb fragments, tracked down videos of airstrikes in the area and studied before-and-after satellite imagery. We also obtained and analyzed more than 100 coordinate sets for suspected ISIS sites passed on by intelligence informants. We then mapped each neighborhood door to door, identifying houses where ISIS members were known to have lived and locating ISIS facilities that could be considered legitimate targets. We scoured the wreckage of each strike for materials suggesting an ISIS presence, like weapons, literature and decomposed remains of fighters. We verified every allegation with local administrators, security forces or health officials.\n\n  In Qaiyara\u2019s residential district, where small wheat-colored homes sit behind low concrete walls, one or two structures had been reduced to rubble on almost every block. We went to all of them. A significant part of our efforts involved determining which air force \u2014 Iraqi or coalition \u2014 carried out each strike. Either way, according to official accounts, the air war in Qaiyara was remarkably precise: The coalition has stated that it killed only one civilian in or near the town, while the Iraqi Air Force has not acknowledged any civilian deaths in the area.\n\n  It was soon clear that many more had died. We visited one house that stood partly intact but for the rear alcove, which had been pancaked. A woman stepped out from the front of the structure, three children orbiting her. She told us her name, Inas Hamadi. \u201cMy children died here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt happened so quickly.\u201d One of the surviving children, Wiham, 11, remembered waking up to the sound of aircraft and running under the stairs to hide with her six siblings and cousins. Then the house was struck, collapsing the staircase onto them. Riam, 8, and Daoud, 5, did not survive. \u201cDaoud\u2019s body was full of shrapnel,\u201d Wiham said. \u201cRiam had a hole beside her ear and a hole in her brain. She looked around and was dizzy.\u201d\n\n  The strike was witnessed by neighbors, who helped rescue the children. Everyone agreed that the target was most likely the hospital or a pair of homes on the next street, all of which had been commandeered by ISIS. We collected the names and photographs of the dead and checked satellite imagery to confirm the date range of the strike. The deaths were never reported, were never recorded in any public database and were not investigated by the coalition.\n\n  We continued in this fashion, door to door. What we found was sobering: During the two years that ISIS ruled downtown Qaiyara, an area of about one square mile, there were 40 airstrikes, 13 of which killed 43 civilians \u2014 19 men, eight women and 16 children, ages 14 or younger. In the same period, according to the Iraqi federal police, ISIS executed 18 civilians in downtown Qaiyara.\n\n  In Shura and Aden, we found a similar discrepancy between the number of civilian deaths on the ground and the number reported by the coalition. Through dozens of interviews at each site in all three locations, along with our house-to-house mapping, we tried to determine the reasons behind each airstrike that killed civilians. Coalition officials say ISIS fighters embedded in the population, making it difficult to avoid hitting civilians nearby. This appeared to be the case for about one-third of the deadly strikes \u2014 for example, a September 2016 strike on an ISIS-occupied primary school in Shura that killed three civilians in the vicinity.\n\n  But in about half of the strikes that killed civilians, we could find no discernible ISIS target nearby. Many of these strikes appear to have been based on poor or outdated intelligence. For example, last fall we visited a bombed-out house on the edge of Qaiyara, near the rail yard. It belonged to the family of Salam al-Odeh; neighbors and relatives told us the family had been sleeping one night when they awoke to the shudder of an airstrike nearby. Sometimes strikes came in pairs, so Salam\u2019s wife, Harbia, scooped up their baby, Bara, and ran out the door. Salam scrambled to save his other children \u2014 his daughter, Rawa, and his sons, Musab and Hussein. But then a second strike hit. Salam, the baby and Hussein were killed instantly. His wife hung on until she reached the hospital, where she told her relatives what happened, but then died from her injuries. A few weeks later, Musab died of his wounds too. Only Rawa, who was 2, survived. Several months later, we found the person who called in the strike, one of the coalition\u2019s main sources in Qaiyara, a local Iraqi official we are not identifying for his safety. He told us that while on a walk one day, he spotted an ISIS mortar under a clump of trees near the rail yard and transmitted the coordinates. (Neighbors also told us that ISIS had occupied and then abandoned a house in the area a year earlier, which a different informant may have told the coalition about.) By the time the information made its way to the coalition and it decided to act, the mortar had been moved.\n\n  Such intelligence failures suggest that not all civilian casualties are unavoidable tragedies; some deaths could be prevented if the coalition recognizes its past failures and changes its operating assumptions accordingly. But in the course of our investigation, we found that it seldom did either.\n\n  In June, for example, we visited an electrical substation occupying several blocks of the Aden neighborhood in eastern Mosul. On the evening of April 20, 2015, aircraft bombed the station, causing a tremendous explosion that engulfed the street. Muthana Ahmed Tuaama, a university student, told us his brother rushed into the blaze to rescue the wounded, when a second blast shook the facility. \u201cI found my brother at the end of the street,\u201d he said. \u201cI carried him.\u201d Body parts littered the alleyway. \u201cYou see those puddles of water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just like that, but full of blood.\u201d We determined that at least 18 civilians died in this one attack and that many more were grievously wounded. News of the strike was picked up by local bloggers, national Iraqi outlets and ISIS propaganda channels and was submitted as an allegation to the coalition by Airwars. Months later, the coalition announced the results of its investigation, stating that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to find that civilians were harmed in this strike.\u201d Yet even a cursory internet search offers significant evidence that civilians were harmed: We found disturbingly graphic videos of the strike\u2019s aftermath on YouTube, showing blood-soaked toddlers and children with their legs ripped off.\n\n  A key part of the coalition\u2019s investigation process is to match civilian casualty accusations against its own logs. Chris Umphres, an Air Force captain at Udeid who assesses allegations of civilian casualties, told us that military investigators possess the coordinates of \u201cevery single strike conducted by coalition forces,\u201d crucial information unavailable to the typical journalist. \u201cWe have 100 percent accountability of where all of our weapons are employed.\u201d\n\n  We found this to not always be the case. For every location we visited, we submitted GPS coordinates to determine whether it was the coalition or the Iraqi Air Force that bombed the site. At first, the coalition told us it did not have the time or the staff to check more than a handful of the coordinates. But eventually, a team of Air Force analysts at Udeid agreed to compare the dates and coordinates of each of the 103 sites in our sample with those the coalition had recorded in its airstrike log. If a strike in our sample occurred within 50 meters of a strike that was recorded in the logs, they classified it as a \u201cprobable coalition airstrike,\u201d while assessing those outside this range \u2014 that is, anything more than a couple of house-lengths away \u2014 as \u201cunlikely.\u201d\n\n  By this measure, 30 of the 103 strike sites in the sample we submitted are probable coalition strikes. But other evidence suggests that the coalition was responsible for many more. Human rights organizations have repeatedly found discrepancies between the dates or locations of strikes and those recorded in the logs. In one instance, the coalition deemed an allegation regarding a strike in the Al-Thani neighborhood of Tabqa, Syria, on Dec. 20, 2016, as \u201cnot credible,\u201d explaining that the nearest airstrike was more than a kilometer away. After Human Rights Watch dispatched researchers to the ground and discovered evidence to the contrary, the coalition acknowledged the strike as its own.\n\n  We found many such discrepancies. For instance, the Air Force analysts said it was unlikely that the coalition had struck Qaiyara\u2019s water-sanitation facility because the logs recorded the nearest strike as 600 meters away, which would place it outside the compound entirely. Yet we discovered a video \u2014 uploaded by the coalition itself \u2014 showing a direct strike on that very facility. (When we asked Lt. Col. Damien Pickart, director of public affairs at Udeid, about this discrepancy, he said he could only report \u201cwhat the strike log shows.\u201d) Similarly, we were told that a strike we identified on Qaiyara\u2019s main bridge was unlikely to be by the coalition, because the nearest strike was on a truck 150 meters away. We again found a coalition video showing a direct hit on the structure. Pickart explained the inconsistency by saying the coalition had conducted multiple strikes on various targets within an hourlong period, only one of which was included in the official log.\n\n  The most common justification the coalition gives when denying civilian casualty allegations is that it has no record of carrying out a strike at the time or area in question. If incomplete accounts like these are standard practice, it calls into question the coalition\u2019s ability to determine whether any strike is its own. Still, even using the most conservative rubric and selecting only those 30 airstrikes the Air Force analysts classified as \u201cprobable\u201d coalition airstrikes, we found at least 21 civilians had been killed in six strikes. Expanding to the 65 strikes that fell within 600 meters \u2014 for example, the strikes on the home of Inas Hamadi in Qaiyara and the electrical substation in Aden \u2014 pushed that figure to at least 54 killed in 15 strikes. No matter which threshold we used, though, the results from our sample were consistent: One of every five airstrikes killed a civilian.\n\n  To understand how radically different our assessment is from the coalition\u2019s own, consider this: According to the coalition\u2019s available data, 89 of its more than 14,000 airstrikes in Iraq have resulted in civilian deaths, or about one of every 157 strikes. The rate we found on the ground \u2014 one out of every five \u2014 is 31 times as high.\n\n  Basim\u2019s case had now become impossible to ignore. Based on the evidence we provided, Maj. Gen. Scott Kindsvater, then an Air Force deputy commander, ordered an internal investigation to determine what might have gone wrong on the night of the strike. And then, on Feb. 14, for the first time in the 17 months since the attack, Basim received an email from the coalition. \u201cWe deeply regret this unintentional loss of life in an attempt to defeat Da\u2019esh,\u201d Scrocca wrote, using another term for ISIS. \u201cWe are prepared to offer you a monetary expression of our sympathy and regret for this unfortunate incident.\u201d He invited Basim to come to Erbil to discuss the matter. Basim was the first person to receive such an offer, in Iraq or Syria, during the entire anti-ISIS war.\n\n  Early in the morning of his scheduled meeting, Basim dreamed about Mayada. He could feel her skin next to his. He suddenly felt a surge of regret for things said and left unsaid, accrued over a lifetime together. He awoke in tears. \u201cI washed my face,\u201d he said, \u201cdid my morning prayer and sent her my prayers. It made me calmer.\u201d\n\n  It was March 17. The air outside was soft and cool; Erbil had finally experienced rainfall after a parched winter. The coalition had asked Basim to go to Erbil International Airport, where he would be picked up and taken to meet coalition representatives and receive a condolence payment. He invited us to join him, and we agreed. Basim did not know how much money the Americans would offer, but he had spent hours calculating the actual damages: $500,000 for his and Mohannad\u2019s homes, furnishings and belongings; $22,000 for two cars; and $13,000 in medical bills from Turkey. We stood waiting in the parking lot. A white S.U.V. with tinted windows rolled by. A family emerged from a taxi, the father juggling two suitcases and a toddler, heading off on what appeared to be a vacation.\n\n  Basim checked his phone to see the latest messages from friends in Mosul. It had been a month since Iraqi forces seized the eastern half of the city, but the Woods were still too dangerous to visit because ISIS controlled the opposite bank and was lobbing mortars across the river. On the west side, thousands were trapped in the Old City, and Basim heard stories that ISIS was welding doors shut to keep people in their homes, holding them hostage against heavy artillery and air power. That morning, an airstrike flattened almost an entire city block in the Mosul Jidideh neighborhood \u2014 killing 105 civilians, according to the coalition, or possibly double that number, according to Airwars, in either case making it one of the largest aerial massacres since the war began.\n\n  It was late afternoon, 30 minutes past the meeting time, when an S.U.V. rolled up, an American in Army fatigues behind the wheel. We climbed in, and the truck moved off through the sprawling airfield, past rows of parked helicopters, toward a set of hangars. Basim struggled to maintain his composure. He\u2019d imagined this day a hundred times, but now he wasn\u2019t sure what to say, how to act. The driver made small talk about the weather, the winter drought, the needs of farmers. He pulled the truck around to a prefab trailer ringed by blast walls. Inside, sitting around a large wooden table, were more American soldiers. Capt. Jaclyn Feeney, an Army attorney, introduced herself and invited Basim to be seated.\n\n  \u201cWe just wanted to start by expressing our deepest sympathies, not only on behalf of the Army but on behalf of myself,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do take the closest care in what we do here, but it\u2019s high risk, and sometimes we make mistakes. We try our best to prevent those mistakes, but we hope that since we did make a mistake here, we can do everything that we can to right it, as best we can. I know there\u2019s nothing that I can say that can make up for the loss that you\u2019ve \u2014 \u201d\n\n  \u201cThe only thing that cannot be returned is the loss of life,\u201d Basim said. His hands gripped the armrests, as if he were using every ounce of energy to stay seated. He struggled to keep his voice steady. \u201cEverything else could be redone or rebuilt. The loss of life is unrepairable.\u201d\n\n  \u201cCertainly. We are prepared to offer you a condolence payment,\u201d Feeney replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to recompensate you for what you\u2019ve lost, or for rebuilding or anything like that. It\u2019s just meant to be an expression of our sympathy, our apologies for your loss.\u201d\n\n  Outside, a plane lifted off, and the room trembled. Feeney was holding documents in her hand. \u201cAnd so for that reason, we are capped in the amount that we can give you. So the amount in U.S. dollars is $15,000, which we will be paying you in Iraqi dinars, so 17,550,000 dinars. And so, if you\u2019re willing to accept that \u2014 \u201d\n\n  Basim looked at her in disbelief. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n  \u201cYou\u2019re not willing to accept that?\u201d\n\n  \u201cThis is \u2014 this is an insult to me. No, I will not accept it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n  Feeney looked stunned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry also,\u201d she said.\n\n  Moments passed, and everyone sat in silence. Feeney explained again that they were capped by their own regulations. Basim replied, \u201cThis is, I have to say, I\u2019m sorry to say, ridiculous.\u201d Basim said he wanted official documentation proving his innocence, so that he could return safely to Mosul one day. Feeney promised to make some calls. The meeting quickly came to an end.\n\n  Basim walked out into the late-afternoon air. Traffic at the airport had picked up: buses overloaded with families, children sticking their elbows out of taxis. Basim drove home in disbelief, as if he were living through an elaborate hoax and the Americans would call back any minute with a serious offer. The truth was, he never expected to recover the full extent of his material losses, and he knew the military was not in the business of compensation, only condolence, but after so many months, so much back and forth, the humiliation burned. \u201cThis is what an Iraqi is worth,\u201d he said.\n\n  At home, he considered his options. He wanted a lawyer \u2014 but from where? Could an Iraqi find an American attorney? The amount the coalition had offered exceeded its own guidelines, which stipulated $2,500 per Iraqi, but did not cover Mohannad and Najib, which meant he \u2014 or his sister-in-law \u2014 would potentially have to endure this process again. He considered traveling to the United States to find an advocate, but getting a visa was almost impossible. Once, in the first months after the attack, he even wanted to move there, seek asylum. Now the thought seemed absurd.\n\n  Despite everything, Basim could not bring himself to hate Americans. In fact, this experience was further evidence for a theory he had harbored for a while: that he, fellow Iraqis and even ordinary Americans were all bit players in a drama bigger than any of them. A few weeks later, he spoke to Sociology 119, Sam Richards\u2019s Race and Ethnic Relations class at Penn State. \u201cI have nothing against the regular American citizen,\u201d he told the class of some 750 students. \u201cI lived among you guys for eight years. I was never bothered by any person \u2014 in fact, many of them were very helpful to me.\u201d\n\n  \u201cThis situation of war,\u201d he continued, \u201cbig corporations are behind it.\u201d This is where the real power lay, not with individual Americans. He\u2019d come to believe that his family, along with all Iraqis, had been caught in the grinder of grand forces like oil and empire, and that the only refuge lay in something even grander: faith. He had rediscovered his religion. \u201cThere was some bond that grew between me and my God. I thanked him for keeping my son alive. I thanked him that my operation was successful. Now I can walk.\u201d\n\n  It was the same God who had written out his whole life from the 40th day in the womb. Basim\u2019s faith in this divinely authored fate had become a calming current, coursing through his every waking moment. \u201cSometimes I go out with my friends,\u201d Basim told the students. \u201cBut when I come back home, when I go to bed and thoughts start coming into my head about my wife, what would have happened probably five years from now, my daughter would be in college, she wanted to study this and that \u2014 there isn\u2019t a day that goes by that I don\u2019t think about them. But in the end, life goes on.\u201d\nAhmed al-Layla tried to persuade his parents to escape from Mosul with his sister, Eaman, and join him in Erbil, but they were stubborn. His father, Mohammed Tayeb al-Layla (below left), a former dean of engineering at Mosul University, refused to abandon his prized library, shelf after shelf of books on engineering and soil mechanics. As the Iraqi Army approached, neighbors told us, several ISIS fighters broke into the home, climbed to the roof and assumed sniper positions. Ahmed\u2019s father raced up in pursuit, with Ahmed\u2019s mother, Dr. Fatima Habbal (below right), a prominent gynecologist, close behind. Not long after, an airstrike flattened the home, killing the snipers, along with Ahmed\u2019s parents and sister.\n  Next, according to the report, the coalition dispatched a drone to surveil the property. Over three days, in 15-to-30-minute windows, his house was filmed. The investigation acknowledged that \u201cno overtly nefarious activity was observed,\u201d but nonetheless everything the coalition witnessed confirmed its conviction that it was filming a terrorist headquarters. No weapons were visible, but the report noted that ISIS \u201cdoes not obviously brandish weapons,\u201d so as to go undetected. Occasionally Basim or Mohannad would open their shared gate to the street, allowing a guest to enter. The coalition simply saw men opening a gate, an action that it determined was consistent with the activity of an ISIS headquarters. And, perhaps most important, the report stated that the coalition did not observe any women or children outdoors \u2014 although in the ISIS-controlled city, women rarely left the house to avoid the religious police, and most filming had occurred under the blistering afternoon sun, when almost everyone stayed indoors.\n\n  Though the Razzos hadn\u2019t known it, the burden of proof had been on them to demonstrate to a drone watching them from above that they were civilians \u2014 guilty until proved innocent. In the end, 95 minutes of unremarkable footage had sealed the fate of Mayada, Tuqa, Mohannad and Najib. The report concluded that there was \u201cno evidence indicating carelessness or bad faith\u201d on the part of the coalition and that its targeting process \u201cremains sound.\u201d (It also declared that because of an equipment error, the drone footage no longer existed for investigators to review.) Yet to Basim, the truth seemed just the opposite: The coalition had disregarded ground realities and acted on flimsy intelligence.\n\n  Not long after receiving the report, Basim decided to return to the Woods. It was risky to visit \u2014 ISIS was still controlling neighborhoods on the opposite bank \u2014 but he wanted to see, to touch, what was left, and he took us along. We set out in the early morning, driving past dusty abandoned villages, through checkpoints sporting brilliant hoists of red, blue and green militia flags and onto a broad boulevard, teeming with pushcart vendors and street children. Whole city blocks were flattened. Basim was not caught off guard by the destruction, which he expected based on the videos he\u2019d seen, but he was surprised by the traffic. He regarded the passing scenes as if he were a tour guide, recounting the history of each neighborhood. It appeared to be an affectation of calm, a studied attempt to withstand the torment of return, but the truth eventually surfaced. \u201cI\u2019m numb,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just numb.\u201d\n\n  We drove past more ruined buildings. Around the wreckage of one stood a concrete wall, still intact, where ISIS had painted two hands open in supplication. Basim translated the inscription: THANK GOD FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE. IF YOU DO, HE WILL GIVE YOU MORE.\n\n  We headed toward the Tigris River. As we approached, we could see the apartments, houses and minarets on the other side, still under ISIS control. And then suddenly, the city was gone. We entered the Woods, which remained a bucolic oasis. The trees were heavy with figs, apricots and lemons, and the air buzzed with mosquitoes. We pulled up to a pale yellow gate. Basim lingered outside for a moment, afraid to approach. He then opened it and stepped onto his property for the first time in 18 months. We followed him along an overgrown stone path. He stopped in front of a smashed-up wall surrounded by chunks of concrete. Rebar snaked out like hairs. \u201cThis was the laundry room,\u201d he said.\n\n  To the right stood what was once his kitchen. A faint rotten odor emerged from within. The remnants of a table and three chairs were visible. Scattered amid the shattered glass and charred metal bars were pages of recipes: Cookies & Cream Freeze, Chocolate Mousse Torte.\n\n  We moved over the rest of the debris. Marble shards, concrete blocks, several mattresses, two satellite dishes, a Spalding tennis racket, an iron, a book of equations, a bathroom sink. The backyard was intact. \u201cAt least we still have a swimming pool!\u201d Basim said, laughing absently.\n\n  He circled back to the laundry room. There he spotted in a corner, poking out of the rubble, a white platform heel. It belonged to Tuqa. \u201cI told her they were too high and that she would fall,\u201d he said. He could picture her wearing them, coming down the stairs.\nAzmat Khan is an investigative journalist and a Future of War fellow at New America and Arizona State University.

{"Headline": "What the Car Did \u2014 And What It Might Do", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "As the car transformed the American lifestyle, so did it colonize the American imagination. Perhaps the most fascinating artifact of automotive retrofuturism dates to 1958, two years into the Interstate building boom, when Disney produced an hourlong TV program called \u201cMagic Highway, U.S.A.\u201d After a half-hour or so celebrating the car\u2019s ascent, the program pivoted to envisioning its future. At a time when Eisenhower\u2019s Interstate project \u2014 inspired, famously, by his awe at traveling Hitler\u2019s autobahn during the Nazi overthrow \u2014 was seizing private property through eminent domain around the country, Disney imagined atomic-powered tunnel borers and imperial road-building machines as tall and wide as skyscrapers, cutting through landscapes and leaving fully constructed roadways in their wake. Dreaming further forward, the program extrapolated from the new real-world highways to envision literal high-ways of clear tubes raised far above the urban environment, magnificent air-conditioned arteries that someday would \u201clink together all nations and help create a better understanding among the peoples of the world.\u201dSome of Disney\u2019s imagined future has indeed become our present, from rear-facing cameras to automated GPS-style directions. But the program\u2019s writers and illustrators would no doubt have been shocked to learn that in 2017, nearly 60 years into the glorious automotive future, the physical highways we drive on would be functionally identical (probably inferior, in fact, after decades of neglect and disrepair) to those outside their office windows. Perhaps the most succinct explanation for why Disney did not get its future highways is that Eisenhower got his. The realization of the Interstate System wound up spanning three and a half decades and consuming hundreds of billions of dollars in construction costs, an unparalleled, concentrated investment of financial and political capital that ensured any new transportation innovations for decades would need to be designed to exploit it. Like so many sci-fi dreamers, Disney\u2019s writers tried to think of the perfect transportation system, but in real life, the good-enough \u2014 the version of a technology that a society actually finds, in a concrete historical moment, the money and political will to enact \u2014 often winds up being the enemy of the perfect.More perversely still, the suburban lifestyle that the Interstates enabled also gave rise to an atomized, individualistic politics, which soon bred a revolt against the taxation and central planning that made their construction possible in the first place. Disney\u2019s writers saw a new infrastructural grandeur around them and imagined it would spark more grandeur, but in fact the highway boom proved to be a self-negating act of imagination, like one of those \u201cuseless machines\u201d that sends out a mechanical hand to turn itself off.Instead, as the dismal cycle of road-building and sprawl has continued, the last half century of automotive technology has brought mostly defensive advances \u2014 innovations that add no excitement to the car but merely ameliorate one or more of its truly terrible qualities. Airbags reduced its fatality rate, while federal emissions standards beat back smog. Hybrid and electric drivetrains have allowed some consumers to pay for the pleasure of offsetting, ever so slightly, the upward trajectory of the carbon emissions that will one day render Earth uninhabitable. Looming awareness of climate change has rendered grimly absurd that other great id\u00e9e fixe of automotive futurism, the flying car: The basic mathematics of raising a ton of metal into the air, even if done electrically, are disastrous in a world where the plurality of electricity will be generated with fossil fuels for the foreseeable future. Sci-fi horizons thus foreclosed to them, automakers have poured much of their design energies into weird personalization features (the driver\u2019s seat remembers who you are!) or better integration between stereos and smartphones (never miss a podcast!). After a century in which the car radically remapped American society, creativity about its own future got stuck in a cul-de-sac.But now, the car has been steered once again toward a fantastical sci-fi destination. The dream of cars that drive themselves has been around almost as long as cars have \u2014 Americans saw a concept for some at the 1939 World\u2019s Fair, and another, more far-fetched one in \u201cMagic Highway, U.S.A.\u201d \u2014 but the push to make it real began a little over a decade ago, powered by academic roboticists and funded by the U.S. military. In 2004, Darpa inaugurated its \u201cGrand Challenge,\u201d offering a $1 million prize to an autonomous vehicle that could navigate a 142-mile course; no team\u2019s robot was able to finish that first year, but the following year, five did, with first prize going to Stanford\u2019s team. Google made the dream significantly more real beginning in 2009, when it began pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the concept.In the past five years, the headlong push toward self-driving technology has swept up not just Google\u2019s tech rivals (chief among them Uber, with which Google has become embroiled in a bitter and costly intellectual-property lawsuit) but the world\u2019s automakers as well. Tesla, Cadillac, Volvo, Audi and Nissan have already rolled out models with autonomous modes for highway driving, akin to cruise controls that can also steer and brake; next year, more brands and models will join their ranks. Most of the major automakers say they expect fully autonomous vehicles to be available 15 years from now, and quite a few of them are backing that prediction with enormous capital, from GM\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of a self-driving start-up, Cruise Automation, to Ford\u2019s equally large investment in an A.I. start-up called Argo. Folly or not, self-driving cars are the future that nearly every major car company thinks it has to bet on.For this installment of our annual Tech and Design Issue, we\u2019ve devoted the entire magazine, front to back, to the question of autonomous cars and the future they could usher in. That level of attention seems warranted, given how profoundly this technology could change the way we live, with first- and second- and third-order effects that boggle the mind. We\u2019ve visited with automakers in Detroit and in Silicon Valley to take the measure of their self-driving schemes. But we\u2019ve also indulged in some sci-fi speculation of our own, trying to imagine what would happen if this unprecedented engine of American society \u2014 the machine that, more than any other, for better or worse, has given shape to American life for a century \u2014 really does undergo this radical transformation. The consequences would touch crime and punishment, work and leisure, exercise and partying and sex. Over the next century, they may well alter the built environment as radically as the manually driven car did over the last century.As much as possible, we\u2019ve tried to avoid the trap of extrapolating the future solely from the technology while assuming the society that we currently have. When the automobile came to cities a century ago, the norm was that pedestrians and carriages shared the streets equally, and it would have made sense to imagine that practice would continue. But soon the automotive interests grew powerful enough to seize the streets for themselves \u2014 resulting in the literal invention of a crime, called jaywalking \u2014 and then to displace the arguably superior technology of streetcars. Likewise, self-driving cars will create new power centers, new crimes, just as they will create new counterpowers, new forms of rebellion. Die-hard drivers might not relinquish their steering wheels easily. Industries gored by self-driving technology (Who needs motels if your car has a bed? What happens to gas stations when cars can drive themselves to charging ports?) might flex political muscle to check its progress. Law enforcement might stoke fears of autonomous getaway cars or self-driving terrorism to do the same.Indeed, it\u2019s a set of basic human questions, far more than technology, that will really determine the future of the car. Can cars decouple from their history as a status symbol? Will millennial attitudes on car ownership entrench and deepen, to the point that car-sharing becomes a real cultural norm, or will that generation revert to the American mean as it ages? Will the push to kill the steering wheel look like a new freedom, to be met with excitement, or like a new prohibition, to be met with reactionary backlash? Will we muster the political will to push back on corporate power, as autonomous cars create new quasi-monopolistic giants? Or could autonomous cars actually arrive into a totally different economic and political order, one that they help to bring about? After all, Disney couldn\u2019t have foreseen, in 1958, the political realities of today that would make their imagined future impossible \u2014 realities that the highway itself helped create. The political and social convulsions of the next 50 years will be the real driver of our high-tech future. It\u2019s fun to guess at the ending of that unwritten history, but in truth we don\u2019t entirely know yet how it will begin.Bill Wasik is a deputy editor of the magazine.Advertisement"}

She was cooking dinner while her 3-year-old son, Isaac, watched videos on the YouTube Kids app on an iPad. Suddenly he cried out, \u201cMommy, the monster scares me!\u201dWhen Ms. Burns walked over, Isaac was watching a video featuring crude renderings of the characters from \u201cPAW Patrol,\u201d a Nickelodeon show that is popular among preschoolers, screaming in a car. The vehicle hurtled into a light pole and burst into flames.\u201cMy initial response was anger,\u201d said Ms. Burns, a nurse, who credits the app with helping Isaac to learn colors and letters before other boys his age. \u201cMy poor little innocent boy, he\u2019s the sweetest thing, and then there are these horrible, horrible, evil people out there that just get their kicks off of making stuff like this to torment children.\u201dBut the app contains dark corners, too, as videos that are disturbing for children slip past its filters, either by mistake or because bad actors have found ways to fool the YouTube Kids algorithms.Malik Ducard, YouTube\u2019s global head of family and learning content, said that the inappropriate videos were \u201cthe extreme needle in the haystack,\u201d but that \u201cmaking the app family friendly is of the utmost importance to us.\u201dWhile the offending videos are a tiny fraction of YouTube Kids\u2019 universe, they are another example of the potential for abuse on digital media platforms that rely on computer algorithms, rather than humans, to police the content that appears in front of people \u2014 in this case, very young people.Mr. Ducard said that while YouTube Kids may highlight some content, like Halloween videos in October, \u201cit isn\u2019t a curated experience.\u201d Instead, \u201cparents are in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d he said, pointing to the ability to block channels, set usage timers and disable search results.Parents are also encouraged to report inappropriate videos, which someone at YouTube then manually reviews, he said. He noted that in the past 30 days, \u201cless than .005 percent\u201d of the millions of videos viewed in the app were removed for being inappropriate.\u201cWe strive,\u201d he added, \u201cto make that fraction even lower.\u201dHolly Hart of Gray, Tenn., said she was recently reading while her 3-year-old daughter was in the room when she noticed that Disney Junior characters in the video her daughter was watching started \u201cturning into monsters and trying to feed each other to alligators.\u201d An image previewing a recommended video showed the characters in a provocative pose.\u201cIt was an eye-opener for me,\u201d said Ms. Hart, who had downloaded the app because it was being used at the local elementary school.Most of the videos flagged by parents were uploaded to YouTube in recent months by anonymous users with names like Kids Channel TV and Super Moon TV. The videos\u2019 titles and descriptions feature popular character names and terms like \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201clearn colors.\u201dThey are independently animated, presumably to avoid copyright violations and detection. Some clips uploaded as recently as August have millions of views on the main YouTube site and run automatically placed ads, suggesting they are financially lucrative for the makers as well as YouTube, which shares in ad revenue. It is not clear how many of those views came on YouTube Kids.The Super Ares TV account seems to be linked to a number of other channels targeting children with cartoon imitations, based on their similar channel fonts, animation style and Greek mythology-inspired names, from Super Hermes TV and Super Apollo TV to Super Hera TV.Dr. Michael Rich, a pediatrics professor at Harvard Medical School and the director of the Center on Media and Child Health, said such videos brought up a host of issues for children. \u201cIt\u2019s just made that much more upsetting by the fact that characters they thought they knew and trusted are behaving in these ways,\u201d he said.Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, argued that inappropriate videos on YouTube Kids showed hazards of today\u2019s media reality.Google has largely defended its errors by pointing to the enormous amount of content it hosts, including more than 400 hours of content uploaded to YouTube every minute.Disney and Nickelodeon, mainstays of children\u2019s programming, work with YouTube Kids to introduce children to their characters. But they are also aware that their content can be mixed in with disturbing knockoffs.\u201cNickelodeon creates its characters and shows to entertain kids, so we share the same concern as parents about the unsuitable nature of some of the videos being served to them,\u201d said David Bittler, a spokesman for the Viacom-owned network.A Disney spokesman said YouTube Kids had assured the company that it was \u201cworking on ways to more effectively and proactively prevent this type of situation from occurring.\u201dSome parents have taken to deleting the app. Others, like Ms. Burns, still allow its use, just on a more limited, supervised basis.\u201cThis is a children\u2019s application \u2014 it\u2019s targeted to children,\u201d said Crissi Gilreath, a mother of two in Oklahoma, \u201cand I just can\u2019t believe that with such a big company they don\u2019t have people whose job it is to filter and flag.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "India\u2019s Top Payments App Adds Chatting, Challenging WhatsApp", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 India\u2019s smartphone users love Paytm for sending money and WhatsApp for sending messages. Now each company is getting into the other\u2019s business.Paytm unveiled an updated version of its service on Friday that integrates chat features, including photo and video sharing, into its market-leading digital wallet.The move is a pre-emptive strike against WhatsApp, the global messaging app used by about two-thirds of India\u2019s 300 million smartphone users. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, has been developing a person-to-person payment service for India that it plans to introduce in the next few months.Deepak Abbot, Paytm\u2019s senior vice president of product, said his company had decided to add the communications feature, called Inbox, because its executives saw millions of people using its service to send money to other individuals without any way of discussing those payments inside the app.\u201cIf I sent money to you, I\u2019d wonder, \u2018Hey, have you received the money?\u2019\u201d Mr. Abbot said in an interview. \u201cEither I\u2019d call you, or find another messaging app.\u201d From that simple problem, a full-fledged chat service was born.With nearly $2 billion in financing from Alibaba, China\u2019s leading e-commerce company, and SoftBank, the Japanese investment giant, Paytm jumped in. It marketed itself to small merchants and consumers as an easy way to make all sorts of payments with a few taps on a smartphone. The company now offers a wide range of products, from gold by the gram to airline and movie tickets, and it said 100 million Indians visited its service at least once a month.WhatsApp, which claims more than 200 million monthly active users in India and 1.3 billion worldwide, has eyed business services and person-to-person payments as a potential way to generate revenue from what has been a free service. Facebook paid $22 billion in cash and stock for WhatsApp in 2014.The messaging service has already begun experimenting with verified business accounts in India, which companies use to communicate with customers. The payments feature will let Indian users send immediate payments to one another via a chat message.Neeraj Arora, head of business at WhatsApp, said in an October interview that his team was studying opportunities created by India\u2019s demonetization and the government\u2019s broader campaign to push more business and services online.\u201cThey are trying to digitize every part of society,\u201d said Mr. Arora, who also sits on the board of Paytm. \u201cWe play right in the middle of it. It\u2019s natural for us to think about improving the experience.\u201dWhatsApp\u2019s overall popularity could give its new payments service a leg up, but Mr. Abbot said it would also raise awareness for all digital payment services, including Paytm.WhatsApp, like another new service from Google, Tez, will probably be limited to transferring funds from one person\u2019s bank account to another\u2019s because of complex Indian banking regulations. Paytm has cast itself as a broader financial player, handling payments made by credit and debit cards, the government\u2019s electronic transfer system, and digital wallets.A Paytm banking affiliate is exploring how to offer loans too small to interest a normal bank, with creditworthiness assessed by examining a borrower\u2019s transactions on the service. And a Paytm digital mall is selling physical products.Messaging is just Paytm\u2019s latest brand extension. Mr. Abbot said other plans for the chat service included a personalized news feed of special offers based on each user\u2019s history in the app.\u201cEventually it might become the main screen for Paytm,\u201d he said. \u201cPaytm is at heart a payments company.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At the graduate level, the number is reversed: About 80 percent hail from India, China, Korea, Turkey and other foreign countries.For graduate students far from home, the swirl of cultures is both reassuring and invigorating. \u201cYou\u2019re comfortable everyone is going through the same struggles and journeys as you are,\u201d said Vibhati Joshi of Mumbai, India, who\u2019s in her final semester for a master\u2019s degree in financial engineering. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201dIn arts and humanities, the figure was about 16 percent; in business, a little more than 18 percent.Many factors contribute to the gap, but a major one is the booming job market in technology. For the most part, Americans don\u2019t see the need for an advanced degree when there are so many professional opportunities waiting for them. For some, the price is just too high when they have so much student debt already.\u201cYou can believe that U.S. bachelor\u2019s students, if they\u2019re good, can go get a job at Microsoft or Google with a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d said Edward D. Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington.Universities and employers are eager to tap the pool of international talent that helps them stay competitive globally, and graduate programs have a financial incentive in attracting them: Demand from abroad is so high, administrators don\u2019t see a need to offer as much tuition assistance.The Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, for example, saw a 30 percent decrease in international applications to its professional master\u2019s program for this semester, according to the dean, Joseph J. Helble. Dr. Helble surveyed more than two dozen engineering deans earlier this year, and three quarters of them said they, too, had seen significant drops in international graduate applications. But enrollment, he said, was not off.Still, trends are not clear.\u201cIf there are one or two more years of comparable 20 to 30 percent decreases in international applications, we\u2019re very concerned about our ability to conduct research and spin off and start companies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned from a competitive perspective.\u201dDan Spaulding, who oversees human resources at Zillow Group, the online real estate company, said that in specialized areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence, his company favors graduate degrees, but for the vast majority of its technical jobs, a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science is adequate. He said he has heard concerns from students and managers about an international chill, but for now the supply of students with computer science skills hasn\u2019t been affected.\u201cA great many of them are coming in with programming skills first and looking to radiate out into other business disciplines, product management, product design,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think going deep academically is not a priority for as many computer science students today.\u201dIn 1994, only about 40 percent of students who were enrolled in computer science Ph.D. programs were from outside the country, according to the Computing Research Association survey.As the economy improved, the percentage of Americans in graduate programs dropped. \u201cGoing to grad school became less of a priority for so many students,\u201d said Stuart Zweben, co-author of the survey and professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University. \u201cYou had to really be interested in research or something special.\u201dThe balance of computer science graduate programs began to tilt toward so-called nonresident aliens in the late 1990s, when well-capitalized dot-coms began scouring for programmers, sometimes encouraging summer interns to drop out of school, Dr. Zweben said.Students from other countries have long seen graduate school as their best path to employment and residency in the United States, and for the industry connections they are not likely to find in their home countries.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to get access from here,\u201d said Ms. Joshi, who is president of the N.Y.U. finance club. She wanted to attend N.Y.U. so she could merge her background in information technology with her interest in the financial industry. She has regular exposure to industry speakers and recruiters.And he would like to see more of them enrolled in the graduate programs. \u201cI feel that\u2019s an imbalance,\u201d he said, \u201cthat absolutely needs to be corrected.\u201dNick Wingfield is a technology correspondent at The Times based in Seattle.Advertisement"}

The filing, which is heavily redacted and missing crucial information about the contents of the letter, includes a request from Waymo to delay the start of the trial until after the company has had a chance to conduct more depositions of top witnesses.\u201cThis evidence was never disclosed by Uber despite discovery requests and court orders,\u201d Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Waymo, said in a statement. \u201cWe are eager to start trial, but believe it should be a full airing of the evidence, so we have asked the court for additional time to fully investigate this new information.\u201dThe request is the latest salvo in the fight between the two companies, which have shared a tangled and occasionally friendly history over the last five years. GV, the venture capital arm of Waymo\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, invested hundreds of millions in Uber during its fledgling days as a ride-hailing start-up. Uber also shared information and strategy with David Drummond, a top Alphabet executive, who sat on Uber\u2019s board for years after the investment.But as it became clear that the two companies would become competitors, the relationship soured. Mr. Drummond left Uber\u2019s board last year. And in February, Waymo filed suit against Uber. The suit added legal intrigue to a race to build autonomous vehicles, which automakers, technology companies and auto parts manufacturers believe will be a multibillion-dollar business.For months, Uber has maintained its innocence, and the two companies will argue before Judge Alsup on Tuesday. Jury selection was set to begin on Wednesday.\u201cUber has been waiting for its day in court for quite some time now,\u201d Chelsea Kohler, an Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re keen to have a jury finally hear this case on its merits.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the circumstances surrounding the departure of David Drummond, a top Alphabet executive, from Uber\u2019s board.

{"Headline": "The Best Ways to Share Your Smartphone Photos This Holiday", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixWith the holiday season upon us, families will soon gather for the big annual exchange \u2014 not just gifts, but also memories.For taking photos, smartphones have been a blessing because they include excellent, easy-to-use cameras that people carry everywhere. But the downside is that sharing large batches of digital photos among multiple relatives is hardly straightforward.No family enjoys huddling around and squinting at the small screen on Grandma\u2019s smartphone as she swipes and narrates her vacation in Florida. Even worse is when a sibling bombards you with dozens of text messages of photographs of his baby, burning through your data plan. And let\u2019s not forget the uncle who still carries around a thumb drive.\u201cThere are a few really clever photo sharing tools, but as smart as they are, you might still need to teach family members how they work,\u201d said R. C. Rivera, a professional photographer in San Francisco.So here are some tips for the quickest and most efficient ways to share digital photos, based on my tests and interviews with professional photographers.If you have a modestly sized family, chances are some members use iPhones but others use Androids. The quickest method for everyone to share pics is to rely on a photo storage service that supports both devices.After you sign up for Google Photos, each photo you take is automatically backed up to Google\u2019s cloud. From there, you can create albums for your trip to Spain or your 2-year-old\u2019s birthday party to share with other members of the family with Google accounts. You can also create public albums that anyone can see with a web link.To make sharing more effortless, you can also take advantage of some neat artificial intelligence. Google Photos detects the face of a person and automatically groups all the photos of that person into an album. From there, you can set up Google to automatically share photos of that person with others \u2014 which is great for baby photos.Google Photos is cheap. Google offers to store an unlimited number of compressed images for free. For full-resolution images, you get 15 gigabytes of free storage and can pay at least $2 a month for 100 gigs.Unfortunately, this useful feature is difficult to find. In iOS 11, the latest mobile operating system, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen and hard press in the upper-left corner to open a hidden menu that includes AirDrop. From there, you can set up AirDrop to receive photos from everyone or just people on your contacts list.To share with AirDrop, make sure your relative nearby has AirDrop receiving turned on. On your iPhone, you can select a photo or a group of photos and tap the Share button (a box with an arrow pointing up). Your relative\u2019s device will show up under the AirDrop menu, and you can select the device. The files will move over instantly \u2014 even a batch of 50 photos will take only a few seconds.Your older relatives are probably familiar with the tradition of using a slide projector to show vacation photos or talk about family events. You can do something similar to that with a smartphone, a television set and a media streaming device.There\u2019s always the old-school option of printing out your photos for a physical album. There are several different apps you can use to skip buying a printer.The easiest option for Google Photos users is to just print directly through Google. A photo books tool lets you compile photos into a book. In my tests, dragging some favorite photos from my trip to Japan into a photo book was a breeze. A 20-page book costs $10; each extra page costs 35 cents.Mr. Rivera, the professional photographer, takes the route that requires minimal effort: He regularly prints Google photo books for his relatives. The color accuracy in the photos is not perfect, but the outcome is good enough.\u201cAs a photographer I would scrutinize the color,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for 90 percent of the population, it\u2019s perfect. My parents wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Photo of Billy the Kid Bought for $10 at a Flea Market May Be Worth Millions", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a flea market six years ago, a North Carolina lawyer named Frank Abrams unknowingly bought a rare photograph that experts say shows Billy the Kid relaxing with the man who would eventually kill him.Billy the Kid, one of the best-known outlaws in American history, is thought to be there in the back, second from the left. The man all the way to the right is Pat Garrett, who would soon become the sheriff of Lincoln County, N.M., and \u2014 the story goes \u2014 shoot the outlaw dead in a darkened room.The men appear on a tintype that is about the size of a man\u2019s palm. (Tintypes are photographic images produced on thin sheets of metal. They became popular during the late 19th century and, as in this case, often show a version of reality that is reversed, left-to-right.)A similar find \u2014 a tintype that experts said showed Billy the Kid playing croquet with friends \u2014 was valued at around $5 million in 2015. The discovery motivated Mr. Abrams to take a closer look at his own picture.He turned to Google and eventually zeroed in on the man on the right with the severe features and the dark hat. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d he recalled saying. \u201cThat is Pat Garrett in my picture.\u201dThen, Mr. Abrams began to wonder about the man in the back with the prominent Adam\u2019s apple. He eventually showed the tintype to Robert Stahl, a retired professor at Arizona State University and an expert on Billy the Kid.Mr. Stahl encouraged Mr. Abrams to show the image to experts.William Dunniway, a tintype expert, said the photograph was almost certainly taken between 1875 and 1880. \u201cEverything matches: the plate, the clothing, the firearm,\u201d he said in a phone interview. Mr. Dunniway worked with a forensics expert, Kent Gibson, to conclude that Billy the Kid and Mr. Garrett were indeed pictured.Mr. Stahl said that Mr. Garrett and Billy the Kid, who also went by William H. Bonney and Henry McCarty, were friends who once gambled together. But when Mr. Garrett was about to become the sheriff of Lincoln County, he urged the outlaw to hit the road.\u201cGarrett was saying, \u2018If you leave New Mexico, I\u2019m not going to pursue you. But if you stay in the territory, then no matter where you are, I have to come after you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Stahl said. That would have been around the time the photo was taken.Once he became sheriff, Mr. Garrett\u2019s men did indeed capture Billy the Kid. But the outlaw escaped, killing two deputies on the way out of jail. So Mr. Garrett tracked him down again. The story goes that in 1881, Mr. Garrett was in Fort Sumner visiting a friend of the outlaw\u2019s when the Kid arrived unexpectedly; the men couldn\u2019t really see each other, but Mr. Garrett recognized Billy\u2019s voice and quickly shot him dead.\u201cHis soft blue eye was so attractive that those who saw him for the first time looked upon him as a victim of circumstances,\u201d it reported. \u201cIn spite of his innocent appearance, however, Billy the Kid was really one of the most dangerous characters which this country has produced.\u201dMr. Abrams said he bought the tintype from people who told him it came from Clinton, N.Y. He believes that it had been a possession of Mr. Upson and had found its way to his relatives in the Northeast.And then it made its way to Mr. Abrams, who is, of all things, a criminal defense lawyer. \u201cIt was like taking on the biggest case you could ever imagine,\u201d he said of investigating his artifact, which is now in a safe deposit box.He has not had the tintype formally valuated, and he said that for now, he is not concerned about its monetary value. \"Other people, they want to speculate from here to kingdom come,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s worth.

In decades past, Ives might have spent his summers at ESPN headquarters in Bristol, Conn., coiling wires and fetching coffee. \u201cESPN was definitely on my mind when I got to college,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut Barstool is just a cooler brand that people my age just respect more.\u201d When I asked him what he meant by \u201crespect,\u201d Ives smirked and said: \u201cThe takes are just much more relatable. It\u2019s like Pres says \u2014 Barstool is by the common man, for the common man.\u201d He paused before adding: \u201cESPN is just spitting facts and political correctness.\u201dIves spoke the language of the culture war raging in sports media \u2014 a mix of marketing jargon and Bannon-lite populism directed, at all times, at the self-proclaimed Worldwide Leader in Sports, which stands accused of losing touch with the young bros whose attention it once owned. This is surely part of why, early this fall, ESPN announced \u201cBarstool Van Talk,\u201d a half-hour talk show that would air at 1 a.m. on a secondary channel and feature two of Barstool Sports\u2019s most palatable personalities: Consciously or not, the network wanted to co-opt the resistance.But the day before the Oct. 17 premiere of \u201cVan Talk,\u201d Sam Ponder, host of ESPN\u2019s \u201cSunday N.F.L. Countdown,\u201d tweeted \u201cWelcome to the ESPN family\u201d to one of the show\u2019s hosts \u2014 along with two screen captures of a Barstool blog post from 2014, in which Portnoy called her a \u201cBible-thumping freak\u201d and wrote that her job\u2019s \u201c#1 requirement\u201d was to \u201cmake men hard.\u201d Other outlets, like USA Today\u2019s For the Win blog, surfaced audio from a Barstool show in which Portnoy calls on Ponder to be more \u201cslutty.\u201d Just six days after the first episode aired, John Skipper, ESPN\u2019s president, announced the cancellation of the show in a P.R. statement. \u201cI erred,\u201d he wrote, \u201cin assuming we could distance our efforts from the Barstool site and its content.\u201dThe cancellation sparked joy in sports media\u2019s more progressive ranks, which tend to view Barstool with the same disdain that their colleagues in political news might view Breitbart or The Daily Caller. Skipper\u2019s statement was, however, paying Portnoy a kind of compliment. Only two years ago, any business that wanted to partner with Barstool knew it would be partnering with the unfiltered chauvinism that made Portnoy a minor celebrity in Boston, his hometown. Now the president of the biggest sports network in the world was admitting that he had believed there was a way to temper Barstool for a mainstream market. \u201cOnce upon a time, they\u201d \u2014 ESPN \u2014 \u201cwere the coolest people in the room,\u201d said Richard Deitsch, a media columnist for Sports Illustrated, in a podcast discussing the controversy. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case in 2017. It\u2019s the opposite. They are polarizing; people dislike them on all sides.\u201d By partnering with Barstool, he said, they were trying \u201cto associate themselves with who they believe are the cool kids in the room.\u201dPortnoy says he doesn\u2019t really think ESPN\u2019s future depends on the implied politics of its on-air personalities, but he knows a branding opportunity when he sees one. And the entrenched narrative \u2014 that the once-irreverent network has fed its soul to the hounds of political correctness and liberal fake news \u2014 is certainly an opportunity. As professional athletes have knelt for the national anthem, criticized the president and railed against police violence, ESPN has been repeatedly accused of being too sympathetic to them and too liberal for its own good. A company once built on an aggressively apolitical foundation has somehow become a locus of almost every imaginable type of political fight. As it has blundered its way through widely publicized incidents like Jemele Hill\u2019s tweets about the president and the N.F.L., the sports-radio host Clay Travis has taken to calling the network \u201cMSESPN\u201d; the reporter Britt McHenry has suggested that she was fired from the network for professing her conservative beliefs. Whether these critiques are accurate seems largely irrelevant. Neither does it particularly matter that Portnoy and his cast of bloggers are largely liberal-leaning dudes from the breeding grounds of the coastal elite. There exists a swarm of angry sports fans who maintain that they do not want to talk about Colin Kaepernick or the national anthem, and Barstool has cleared a space for them to gather and talk, mostly, about just how much they don\u2019t want to talk about politics. They claim to be an overlooked majority \u2014 the vast market inefficiency that will richly reward anyone who will let them watch their games, memes and funny videos without having to feel bad about themselves. Barstool is their safe space.Early in the decade, the only sports blogs with any significant audience were Sports by Brooks \u2014 which mostly aggregated news \u2014 and the writer Bill Simmons\u2019s column on AOL\u2019s Digital City Boston. (I later worked for Simmons for three years at Grantland, the ESPN website where he was editor in chief.) Portnoy revered Simmons and agreed with his assessment that Boston\u2019s sports coverage, which was still centered in the column inches of The Globe and The Herald, had grown stale and out of touch with the common man. Not so for Portnoy: In an early mock-up, calling himself Devilfish Dave, he wrote that \u201cthe people at Barstool Sports are a bunch of average Joes, who like most guys love sports, gambling, golfing and chasing short skirts.\u201dBarstool went through the usual spate of early hardships, and there\u2019s every chance that had it been born out of some actual journalistic ideal, it would have folded within the year. But Portnoy\u2019s talent was for gathering feedback from readers and advertisers and tweaking his product accordingly: \u201cWe could pivot really easily,\u201d he told me, \u201cand chase money.\u201d The first breakthrough came when a local photographer told Portnoy he should start putting photos of area women on the tabloid\u2019s covers \u2014 and offered to take the pictures himself. (A version of this idea still exists on the website, under the title \u201cLocal Smokeshow of the Day.\u201d) Around the same time, Portnoy noticed that readers seemed to respond more to stories about drinking, women and gambling than day-to-day sports news. He sold ads to bars and breweries and catered more and more to a certain archetypal Boston bro \u2014 the type who puts on a collared shirt to get blackout drunk every weekend while ruefully cheering on the Red Sox. His writing voice fell into a distinct rhythm, half-cocked and prone to fits of anger. When he finally mustered up a web version of Barstool, it looked like a relic from the 1990s and often crashed, but he called such inconveniences \u201cthe Barstool difference\u201d \u2014 a sign, he maintained, of true authenticity.By the time Barstool began publishing, Simmons had started a national column for ESPN and moved to Los Angeles to write for television. Portnoy had Boston to himself. \u201cWhen Bill was writing on Digital Cities, he was reaching regular guys like me,\u201d Portnoy told me. \u201cI\u2019m reaching the new me.\u201dWhether he knew it or not, Portnoy was also building a modern online-media business well before its time \u2014 with low overhead, an investment in brand loyalty and diversified revenue streams that could withstand fluctuations in advertising. He started hawking T-shirts and merchandise on the site, another venture that fell prey to the Barstool difference; printing and shipping could take months. He built up a network of bloggers in other cities, like Dan Katz in Chicago and Kevin Clancy in New York \u2014 Big Cat and KFC, per their Barstool nicknames. When Portnoy realized that readers were more invested in these bloggers as personalities than in their opinions on sports, he began turning the site into a sort of online reality show: Every office argument and personal-life development was written up and fed to a growing legion of \u201cStoolies.\u201dPart of what Barstool offered these readers was escapism, something that retains a lot of power among sports fans who still see games as a nightly release from their responsibilities. The site\u2019s enduring slogan, \u201cSaturdays Are for the Boys,\u201d promises a day free from girlfriends and wives. Search for the phrase on social media, and you\u2019ll find videos of Stoolies relaxing at beach houses, on boats or at tailgates, surrounded by nothing but shirtless men; in some, they actually push women out of the camera\u2019s frame. Sports could also be a reprieve from office work. In his initial mock-up, in 2003, Portnoy wrote that \u201cwe don\u2019t take ourselves very seriously and view working at Barstool Sports as a way to avoid becoming slaves to cubicle life.\u201d When Clancy, who calls himself \u201cthe king of average,\u201d started writing Barstool New York, he was working as an accountant at Deloitte; when he saw that his tales of mind-numbing corporate boredom were getting traction with readers, he began writing a column called \u201cCubicle Chronicles,\u201d grumbling rancorously about everything from bad coffee to the \u201cfat secretary blasting Dominic the [expletive] Donkey\u201d around Christmas.The only thing the Stoolies wouldn\u2019t do, it turned out, was \u201cpolitics.\u201d For the most part, Portnoy and his readers employed the time-honored bro tactic of saying they had no problem with anyone \u2014 until, of course, \u201canyone\u201d started complaining. A particularly illustrative example of this can be found in an article from 2009, in which a reader informed Portnoy about the \u201cFagbug,\u201d an art installation aimed at raising awareness about homophobic violence. \u201cI could give a [expletive] less if somebody is gay or not,\u201d Portnoy responded, insisting that, much as he enjoyed the female anatomy, if another man preferred the male one, then \u201cmore power to him.\u201d But what, he asked, was the point of the installation? \u201cI thought gay dudes hated being called fags? Or is this like when a black person uses the N-word as a compliment?\u201d He closed by saying all this \u201cfag talk\u201d reminded him of last night\u2019s television: Did anyone else see Adam Lambert on \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d? Every line was aimed directly at dudes who, like Portnoy, would not identify as bigots, but who also scratched their heads at the weird tendencies of anyone who wasn\u2019t exactly like them, self-proclaimed common men.By 2010, Barstool was doing well enough that Portnoy had an office in Milton, Mass., local pages for New York, Chicago and Philadelphia and a handful of employees, including the future YouTube megastar Jenna Mourey, a.k.a. Jenna Marbles. That year, he hired a local white rapper named Sammy Adams and set up a tour of New England colleges. \u201cWhen we showed up on the campuses, they had our signs on their dorms, people were rushing after our bus,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat was the first time I really thought this might be bigger than I anticipated.\u201dThe following year, he started a nationwide party tour called \u201cBarstool Blackout.\u201d The college students who attended danced under blacklights and occasionally \u2014 the obvious implication \u2014 drank until they blacked out. (One of the slogans: \u201cBy the C- student, for the C- student.\u201d) It was Barstool\u2019s first real encounter with controversy. Early in 2012, students in the Boston area demonstrated against the Blackout Parties, claiming that they promoted rape culture and circulating Portnoy\u2019s writings on the subject. \u201cJust to make friends with the feminists,\u201d he\u2019d written on the site, \u201cI\u2019d like to reiterate that we don\u2019t condone rape of any kind at our Blackout Parties in mid-January. However, if a chick passes out, that\u2019s a gray area though.\u201d And: \u201cThough I never condone rape, if you\u2019re a Size 6 and you\u2019re wearing skinny jeans, you kind of deserve to be raped, right?\u201d The parties, which were held at private spaces near campuses, went ahead as planned. Portnoy issued no retractions or apologies. \u201cI think the controversy probably helped us,\u201d he says now. \u201cOur fans liked that we didn\u2019t back down. They realized that I was on their side.\u201dIn a blog post about the sale \u2014 which concluded with the coy signoff \u201cPS \u2014 I\u2019m kinda rich now\u201d \u2014 Portnoy added something prescient: \u201cChernin knows about the Size 6 skinny-jean joke. They know about Babygate.\u201d (The \u201cBabygate\u201d controversy stemmed from Portnoy\u2019s speculating about the size of Tom Brady\u2019s baby\u2019s penis.) \u201cThey know about Al Jazeera.\u201d (In this one, Clancy questioned the legitimacy of any news outlet with an Arabic-sounding name.) \u201cThey get it.\u201dThe Barstool acquisition was engineered by the president of Chernin Digital, Mike Kerns. \u201cWhen I got access to Barstool\u2019s Google analytics, I knew this was something different,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey had something like 20 percent of their visitors coming back about 20 times a day. I\u2019ve been in this business for two decades, and all their numbers bucked the usual trends.\u201d Portnoy kept full editorial control; Chernin\u2019s bet was that it could serve cheap content to his loyal fan base, which would then pay for things like T-shirts, events and premium content. The brand would be scaled up into something that could be sold to advertisers, big media partners and even sports leagues. Every Barstool executive I spoke to mentioned the possibility of opening branded sports bars across the country; all of them talked about partnerships with networks. Since its acquisition, Barstool has released a raft of popular podcasts \u2014 including \u201cPardon My Take,\u201d which, with downloads running up to one million per episode, is one of the biggest sports podcasts in the country. It has partnered with Facebook on a roving pregame college-football show (since canceled) and produced a widely watched baseball show that regularly features former major-league players.This bullish transition has been helmed by Erika Nardini, a 42-year-old former marketing executive who once served as the chief marketing officer for AOL. Nardini, who grew up playing sports with her younger brother, seems uniquely qualified to deal with both the business of turning Barstool into a national brand and the inevitable public- and human-relations disasters that will arise along the way. She is also a woman, and despite its growth since the Chernin acquisition, Barstool still has to work around how bad its worst moments can get \u2014 from Portnoy\u2019s rape jokes to posts like the one a blogger named Chris Spagnuolo wrote this summer: \u201cIs Rihanna Going to Make Being Fat the Hot New Trend?\u201dThe Rihanna incident highlighted how much has changed since the Chernin acquisition, but also how much has stayed more or less the same. The post was quietly taken down. But Portnoy also opined on the site that he thought the post wasn\u2019t \u201cas bad as many are making it out to be,\u201d and that he was angry mostly because Spagnuolo had given \u201cfeminists\u201d fodder to say \u201cthere goes Barstool being Barstool again.\u201d And yet Portnoy himself cannot seem to stop personally offering up more and more of that fodder. A controversy last month, involving the terms of a contract offered to a sports personality named Elika Sadeghi, began on relatively professional footing. Within days, though, Barstool had released a seven-minute animated video in which a cartoon Portnoy says Sadeghi\u2019s surname sounds like \u201cthe monkey from \u2018The Lion King.\u2019\u2009\u201d It also portrays her hanging upside down over a boiling caldron.I spoke to several women in sports media who have had run-ins with Barstool. All described the same pattern: They would tweet something critical of Barstool\u2019s statements about women, which would prompt a response from Portnoy or one of his bloggers. Then came the swarm of Stoolies on social media, who would harass them with misogynist slurs and threats, often for days. Even random sports fans have been targeted. A few years ago, a Cubs fan named Missy suffered a brain injury after a fall; during her recovery, she found that she had trouble reading anything longer than a paragraph, so she moved her usual sports-media consumption over to Twitter. When she saw an article detailing the way Clancy and an army of Stoolies had responded to the Al Jazeera incident, Missy tweeted her support for the author of the article and women she felt had been abused online. Stoolies responded almost immediately, with three days of the usual misogynist epithets and vague threats. A year later, she says, after another comment critical of Barstool, a reader found photos she had posted memorializing a cousin who died of cancer \u2014 and reposted them on Twitter, tagging Barstool writers to do God knows what with them.There\u2019s a uniform response from Barstool employees about the worst of the Stoolies. \u201cI hate seeing it,\u201d Katz told me. \u201cBut it\u2019s just a few idiots who have nothing better to do, and it sucks that people use them to smear an entire company.\u201d The average Stoolie, Portnoy, Clancy and Markovich all argue, is not a misogynist abuser but has been painted with a broad brush by other media outlets. \u201cI\u2019m used to it by now,\u201d Nardini said of the constant negative press surrounding Barstool\u2019s attitudes toward women. \u201cEvery time anyone mentions us in the media, they\u2019re always going to write that requisite paragraph.\u201d She used to be part of a network of female executives, she told me, but \u201cafter they heard I was coming here, every single one of them dropped me like a bad habit.\u201dThe wrath of the Stoolies can occasionally extend to Barstool\u2019s own employees. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single day that would go by without me seeing the N-word in the comments,\u201d Maurice Peebles, Barstool\u2019s first black employee, told me. Peebles ran Barstool\u2019s Philadelphia page for three years. His administrator access allowed him to see that the racial slurs were coming mostly from a concentrated number of IP addresses, which meant that only a few readers were posting the slurs, and over time the site\u2019s filters became better at blocking them. But he doesn\u2019t absolve Barstool of all responsibility. \u201cThey could\u2019ve done more about it,\u201d he says. \u201cNone of the guys who worked at Barstool ever said anything racist to me, but I don\u2019t know if they all understand what it\u2019s like to see that word every day.\u201dBarstool\u2019s reputation \u201cwas certainly listed as a risk,\u201d Kerns says. \u201cBut I think time is on our side. The younger folks within agencies and brands get Barstool and recognize the world is increasingly taking itself less seriously.\u201d Over the past year, that time seemed to have already arrived. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, the advertiser most associated with Boston sports, had long been wary of dealing with Portnoy, but this year, Barstool dedicated an entire month to promoting the chain\u2019s new energy drink. Wendy\u2019s had also expressed hesitation to partner with Barstool, but this summer the company sponsored \u201cBarstool 5th Year,\u201d a Snapchat channel specifically targeted at college students.The question of whether Barstool should be held responsible for the worst behaviors of its fans reflects a fundamental question facing online media \u2014 the same one at the core of Facebook\u2019s issues with fake news, Twitter\u2019s with neo-Nazis and Reddit\u2019s with various toxic communities. Unlike those companies, Barstool can\u2019t hide behind the notion of being an open, neutral platform for the free speech of others. Its readers may come from all sorts of backgrounds, but the core Stoolies are an organic online community that grew under the caring, thoughtful hand of their very own El Presidente. Every new-media venture seeks out an \u201corganic online community\u201d like this \u2014 one that can, in Nardini\u2019s words, \u201cconvert content into commerce.\u201d That community could mean, say, subscribers of The Daily Skimm, an email for millennial women that recaps the news in a peppy, corporate voice. But it can also mean tribes of angry, disaffected young men who gather online to find shelter from the floodwaters of political correctness. This leaves companies like ESPN with a discomforting dilemma. Should they try to create their own communities \u2014 an almost impossible enterprise, especially with young audiences who have grown up on completely independent, unfiltered personalities on YouTube and social media? Or should they co-opt, sanitize and scale audiences like the Stoolies?The other road is to take the popular material that has been built since the Chernin acquisition and take another crack at entering media\u2019s mainstream. I have friends and relatives \u2014 the majority of whom would be considered progressive, many of whom are not white \u2014 who read Barstool regularly, like its videos on Instagram and listen to \u201cPardon My Take.\u201d Some are vaguely aware that Portnoy has said disturbing things about women, but they shrug it off in the same way they shrug off the cloud of bad news that continually engulfs the N.F.L. The vast majority of the Barstool content they consume ticks between standard-fare aggregation (funny videos, memes, weird stories from Florida) and genuinely enjoyable content aimed directly at men who, like me, grew up watching sports and went to colleges where we watched sports with our sports-watching friends.During the N.H.L. finals in June, I went to the Barstool offices to watch a recording of \u201cPardon My Take.\u201d Katz, who is not as fat as he claims to be on air, sat in a La-Z-Boy, idly watching hockey and scribbling notes. His co-host, who goes by the pseudonym PFT Commenter, tried out jokes about handshake lines and the superiority of the N.H.L. to the N.B.A. When the game ended, they settled on a list of segments and piled into a small recording studio, completely bare except for poorly stapled acoustic tiles and posters of Chris Berman and Lenny Dykstra.They rattled through the show without second takes or pauses, the jokes and banter falling into a familiar, rapid rhythm. Katz is the straight man; he is mostly playing himself, an affable dude who loves his Chicago sports and could easily slide into the chair of any ESPN opinion show. PFT Commenter, who has shoulder-length hair and wears Hawaiian shirts, has created a type of character that has never really been seen in sports media \u2014 a gag version of a commenter on the well-trafficked N.F.L. blog Pro Football Talk, his tweets and columns filled with the spelling errors, prejudices and leaps of logic that plague all open forums about sports. In 2015, covering the early part of the presidential campaign, in character, for SB Nation, he would pound airplane bottles of Fireball whiskey and walk straight into scrums of reporters; outside a Republican debate in Cleveland, he held up a sign behind Chris Matthews that read, \u201cIs Joe Flacco a ELITE Quaterback?\u201dAlmost everything about \u201cPardon My Take\u201d is a densely referential sports-fan in-joke. Even the title plays off two ESPN talk shows, \u201cPardon the Interruption\u201d and \u201cFirst Take.\u201d If you\u2019ve never watched Chris Berman run through a highlight reel or admired the sports-yelling talents of Stephen A. Smith, Katz and Commenter might as well be speaking a foreign language. But most sports fans have watched hundreds of hours of ESPN programming, absorbing all the tics, clich\u00e9s and motifs that Katz and Commenter have quilted together into a pitch-perfect satirical pidgin. One of its catchiest elements derives from the N.F.L.-coach habit of explaining some bit of masculine bluster by saying \u201cI\u2019m a football guy\u201d \u2014 in my time at Barstool, at least 70 percent of conversations seemed to include some deadpan variation on \u201cI\u2019m a huge [something] guy.\u201d This entertaining mix has attracted an impressive list of high-profile athletes and media figures to the show. Before the Chernin deal, Portnoy had not seen the value in producing podcasts, which he admitted to me was a \u201cbig mistake\u201d; now \u201cPardon My Take\u201d is Barstool\u2019s flagship product. Katz and Commenter were, until October, proof that Barstool could be scrubbed clean and scaled up.During our conversations, Portnoy kept bringing up \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d mentioning it as a model for Barstool. What he meant was that he wanted to create a broad cast of characters, each capable of his or her own independent success. Barstool has hired the ESPN sideline reporter Julie Stewart-Binks; Michael Rapaport, the character actor who hosts a popular podcast; the former major-league pitcher Dallas Braden; Pat McAfee, an N.F.L. punter who retired midcareer to sign with Portnoy; and Adam Ferrone, a battle-rap champion who told me that he pestered Barstool for two years for a job. By choosing Barstool, each seems to be signing on with the gospel of Portnoy: Say what\u2019s on your mind \u2014 and if anyone has a problem with it, fight back.Over the days to come, Portnoy and a handful of bloggers \u2014 alongside hundreds of Stoolie volunteers \u2014 scrubbed through the social-media accounts of women at ESPN who had spoken out about them, resurfacing every comment that was even slightly off-color. (\u201cI hate hypocrisy,\u201d Portnoy told me \u2014 and that image, of ugly honesty triumphing over hypocrisy, probably explains Barstool\u2019s appeal to young men better than any of its content.) A week later, Henry Lockwood, the producer of \u201cPardon My Take,\u201d tweeted that Britt McHenry had \u201ccankles,\u201d leading to another spat. It was as if Barstool was doubling down on being more Barstool than ever, even though ESPN wasn\u2019t the only partner that had been scared off: Portnoy told me another network had backed away from a deal, and that some advertisers had expressed concern.We talked about something that happened a few hours before ESPN\u2019s announcement, while Portnoy was recording one of his daily pizza reviews \u2014 a Barstool programming staple in which Portnoy tries to review every pizza joint in Manhattan. That day, his guest was Jake Paul, the 20-year-old YouTube heel who might be the only person on the internet better than Portnoy at turning hate and controversy into merchandising opportunities. \u201cPeople know I\u2019m a Jake Paul guy,\u201d Portnoy said. \u201cI respect people who take over the internet, and this guy has got maybe more haters than I do, which I also love.\u201d He ventured that \u201cif you put Team 10\u201d \u2014 the name of Paul\u2019s company \u2014 \u201cwith the Stoolies, I think we can bring down, like, the entire country.\u201dHe was joking, but if companies like ESPN want to corral the millions of young people who have cut cable cords, turned off \u201cSportsCenter\u201d and flocked to unfiltered and anarchic internet personalities, they will have to reckon with Jake Pauls and Dave Portnoys. The truth about ESPN\u2019s supposed bias will not really matter: A lot of people, like Ives the intern, believe that the Worldwide Leader in Sports no longer speaks to them. Their grievances, like those of the angry men who fume over the female cast of \u201cGhostbusters\u201d or ethics in video-game journalism, will seem absurdly petty, whether they\u2019re complaining about the rare yet somehow oppressive sight of a female sportscaster or the unbearable burden placed upon their consciences by a two-minute conversation about Colin Kaepernick. But they will voice these grievances online with enough volume and vitriol to worry even the most reasonable media executive. And if that executive doesn\u2019t bend to their will, they will seek out someone, anyone, who feels more authentic to their experience, whatever that may mean. For huge media conglomerates, this dynamic might matter only in the margins; ESPN surely has more immediate business concerns. But gains in media right now occur only in the margins. The market inefficiencies will not be ignored.In his office, I asked Portnoy why he thought ESPN had been interested in partnering with Barstool in the first place, given its past.

{"Headline": "Microsoft to Expand Campus, as Amazon Looks Elsewhere", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetThe project, which Microsoft plans to announce at its annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday, amounts to a major overhaul of the company\u2019s 500-acre campus in Redmond, Wash., the leafy Seattle suburb that it has called home since 1986.Amazon said it received 238 bids from across North America and is whittling down the list to a group of finalists, with a winner to be announced next year.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said the company did not intend for its hometown expansion \u2014 which he described as a multibillion-dollar investment \u2014 as a comment on Amazon. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re out to make a statement about what anyone else is doing or not doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is the right decision for us.\u201dStill, Mr. Smith could not resist a slight dig. \u201cWhen it comes to headquarters, one is enough, we feel,\u201d he said.Today Microsoft\u2019s Redmond campus has most of the trappings found at the sprawling headquarters of tech giants in Silicon Valley \u2014 the soccer fields, manicured lawns and oceans of parking lots. That will not change on its renovated campus, but Microsoft is taking a different approach in other respects.The new buildings will be clustered closer together. They will also be taller \u2014 four stories instead of the two or three that are common now. There will be a new underground parking facility, a 2-acre open plaza that will serve as a central gathering place and new walking and cycling trails.\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to build a somewhat denser campus and create a somewhat more urban feel,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The company\u2019s decision to stay put at its Redmond campus flies in the face of a trend among technology companies to gravitate closer to cities. The abundance of amenities, night life and public transportation in urban areas has led to thriving tech scenes in San Francisco, New York and other cities.\u201cMy gut reaction is, \u2018Wow, they seem kind of out of touch,\u2019\u201d said Dan Bertolet, a researcher at Sightline Institute, a nonprofit in Seattle focused on sustainability. \u201cAll the young people I know who work in the tech industry out there want to be in Seattle. They pooh-pooh places like Redmond.\u201dTech companies are also finding that the talent they are after increasingly wants to live in cities, not suburbs. That has led suburban giants like Google, Facebook and Apple to operate large private bus services to ferry workers to their headquarters. Microsoft\u2019s own bus service has more than 94 buses and over 4,000 daily riders.But those buses also frequently sit in soul-crushing traffic. Possible relief for Microsoft\u2019s commuters will come in the form of light-rail that will connect it to Seattle. A light-rail station on Microsoft\u2019s campus is scheduled to open by 2023.Had Microsoft decided to move to Seattle rather than remain in the suburbs, the company would likely have faced severe criticism from affordability advocates, who are worried about lower income residents getting pushed out of the city.Mr. Bertolet said suburban areas outside Seattle tend to restrict the density of housing so they\u2019re not likely to develop an urban atmosphere without significant change. \u201cMaybe in the long term,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s better to have a regional network of bigger cities, but getting there will be rough.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Not the Bots We Were Looking For", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyBut despite the tech industry\u2019s efforts and hopes, the bots that have most effectively lodged themselves in the public\u2019s consciousness over the last year were not here to help \u2014 at least, not us. A different sort of bot \u2014 undercover but public-facing, highly political but comparatively primitive \u2014 was implicated in toxic and disorienting online conversations throughout the 2016 election cycle. Before the election, researchers at Oxford University suggested that between the first and second presidential debates, more than a third of pro-Trump tweets and almost a fifth of pro-Clinton tweets came from bot accounts. Political social bots have been stealing headlines ever since, described variously as \u201cfake Americans,\u201d as \u201cweaponized\u201d and as \u201cfake-news-disseminating\u201d agents of Russia.Such motive-centric descriptions tend to give too much credit to the influence bots. Mostly they are crude imitations of regular, if single-minded, people that, by virtue of existing and posting \u2014 a lot \u2014 are able to manipulate platforms\u2019 shared spaces: They increase visible follower counts and sharing metrics; they create Twitter trends and hijack or pollute hashtags into uselessness; they flood searches around breaking news. They probably don\u2019t follow you, and you probably don\u2019t follow them, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. They find their strength in numbers. They thrive just out of sight but fully within earshot.This type of bot bears little resemblance to the ones demonstrated on the stages of tech campus auditoriums. But each sort of bot is made, in its own way, to exploit untapped opportunity in large-scale automation. Where commercial bot-makers see an almost-too-good-to-be-true chance to simultaneously personify their brands and automate their businesses, political bot-makers see an opportunity to exploit anonymity with a humanlike touch at an inhuman scale. While tech companies stand proudly behind their bots, the people who create prolific and ideological social bots hide behind them. (Their provenance remains murky even today.)But the proximity is toxic, and custody of the word is slipping. Bots, it turns out, make an excellent foil. Angela Merkel, in the run-up to this year\u2019s German federal election, talked about bots, generally, as if they were an invading army. In May, Hillary Clinton pointed to Russia-backed online efforts \u2014 including \u201cthe bots\u201d \u2014 as \u201cjust out of control.\u201d The phrase \u201cnot a bot\u201d now litters the profiles of politically engaged Twitter users (and, presumably, some bots). At the same time, President Trump, or a staff member, has indulged a habit of wandering into Twitter\u2019s uncanny valley to retweet supportive accounts whose humanity is hard to discern, or which eventually and mysteriously just disappear.Social automation is both disruptive and revealing. Twitter in particular dehumanizes users in the process of giving them access to one another, so of course bots could thrive there \u2014 and of course they\u2019d closely resemble our worst-tweeting selves. Voice-and-text-activated assistants help monopolistic companies further consolidate power, and they complicate the stories we tell ourselves about privacy, as we invite the eyes and ears of the world\u2019s most ambitious tech businesses into our most personal spaces. Alexa reminds us what Amazon wants; Twitter bots show us how online mass communication breaks down. What was truly great about Hubot, the cobbled-together, inscrutable, mostly useless chat automaton, was the suggestion it made, through each absurd routine: that online, it\u2019s necessary that we build spaces for ourselves.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Signs of Russian Meddling in Brexit Referendum", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 More than 150,000 Russian-language Twitter accounts posted tens of thousands of messages in English urging Britain to leave the European Union in the days before last year\u2019s referendum on the issue, a team of researchers disclosed on Wednesday.More than 400 of the accounts that Twitter has already identified to congressional investigators as tools of the Kremlin, other researchers said, also posted divisive messages about Britain\u2019s decision on withdrawing from the bloc, or Brexit, both before and after the vote.Most of the messages sought to inflame fears about Muslims and immigrants to help drive the vote, suggesting parallels to the strategy that Russian propagandists employed in the United States in the 2016 election to try to intensify the polarization of the electorate.The separate findings amount to the strongest evidence yet of a Russian attempt to use social media to manipulate British politics in the same way the Kremlin has done in the United States, France and elsewhere.On Tuesday, the chief of the National Cyber Security Center released a summary of a prepared speech asserting that in the past 12 months, Russian hackers had unleashed cyberattacks on the British energy grid and the telecommunications and media industries.Any evidence that Moscow did, however, may also complicate the already vexed politics surrounding the issue.But the British government, consumed by the negotiations for an exit from the European Union, has not yet obtained similar disclosures. Although a parliamentary committee recently asked the social media companies for information, many critics have argued that the government has little appetite for an inquiry that could muddy its mandate.The social media companies, including Facebook, Twitter and Google, have had little incentive to volunteer information about the exploitation of their own platforms. And the predominantly right-wing, pro-Brexit British press, particularly the powerful tabloids, have little enthusiasm for undermining the validity of the referendum.The researchers, Oleksandr Talavera and Tho Pham, of Swansea University in Wales, said in interviews on Wednesday that the Russian accounts, which had posted very little about Brexit in the month before the referendum, became quite active at the last minute: from about 1,000 a day two weeks before the vote to 45,000 in the last 48 hours and 39,000 on the day the results were announced, June 24, 2016.\u201cIt is very strange that someone whose language is Russian tweets in English,\u201d Ms. Pham said \u2014 describing it as an anomaly that had prompted the researchers to look more closely at 10 of the most active accounts under suspicion.Nine had been deleted, and the last, Sveta1972, appeared to emanate from a Russian resort town. On the eve of the referendum, Sveta1972 urged Britain to \u201cmake June the 23rd our Independence Day.\u201dThey found that 419 of the 2,752 accounts already identified by Twitter to congressional committees as being linked to the Kremlin had posted 3,500 times using Brexit hashtags.More than 70 percent of those posts were after the vote, but 38 of the accounts tweeted a total of 400 times on the day of the vote, said Laura Cram, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, who conducted the study with her colleague, Clare Llewellyn.Researchers study Twitter for indications of broader patterns in social media, because information about its users and contents is more accessible than in the larger but less-open platforms like Facebook. But without the disclosure of more information from the companies, social scientists said, neither of the findings disclosed this week will provide conclusive evidence of a deliberate Kremlin campaign to influence the Brexit vote or other British elections.Ms. Cram, for example, noted that Russian propagandists might have used hashtags related to Brexit only because they fit with protectionist, nativist or anti-Muslim themes that resonated in the context of the American election, as well.\u201cThese accounts were definitely using Brexit hashtags,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we cannot say whether they were primarily trying to influence Brexit or whether it was a side effect of them trying to wreak discord generally.\u201d\u201cMany of these accounts strongly pushed the narrative that all Muslims should be equated with terrorists and made the case that Muslims should be banned from Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is very consistent with the Russian strategy on U.S. issues, and the fact that they were using the same tactics to target Europeans is extremely telling.\u201dRaphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is the Age of the Artistic Recluse Over?", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIN THE EARLY 1880S, a recent arrival to Amherst, Mass., gossiped in a letter about her neighbor, \u201ca lady whom the people call the Myth. She is a sister of Mr. Dickinson, & seems to be the climax of all the family oddity. She has not been outside of her own house in fifteen years.\u201d The details were tantalizing: \u201cShe dresses wholly in white, & her mind is said to be perfectly wonderful. She writes finely, but no one ever sees her.\u201dMore than a century later, a gentleman in Yonkers wrote an article for his local paper about a man named Don DeLillo, who lived on the same street and whom he\u2019d often run into while walking his dog. \u201cDeLillo didn\u2019t seem all that approachable,\u201d he noted of the author, admitting he was more of a Carl Hiaasen fan. \u201cOh, he\u2019d nod and smile faintly when we passed on the parkway bridge leading to Bronxville. But serious writers don\u2019t advertise their presence. They tend to be quiet, solitary types who fight internal battles. You don\u2019t want to bug them during their death struggle with writer\u2019s block.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to say when, precisely, the myth of artistic reclusiveness finally lost its luster \u2014 certainly before Sia came out from behind her wig, or even before Thomas Pynchon, the last of our great literary recluses, voiced himself on \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on two episodes in 2004 drawn with a bag over his head. (The irony, of course, is that if Pynchon simply had a recent author photo \u2014 the only known portraits of him are from the 1950s \u2014 no one would really care about unmasking him anymore.)Now that we have terms like social anxiety disorder and agoraphobia and drugs like Paxil, retiring to one\u2019s bedchamber feels less Emily Dickinson, more hikikomori. It\u2019s all too easy to believe the age of the artistic recluse is over, given that most artists now cultivate a cyclical relationship with the spotlight, intermittently stepping into and receding from it. It\u2019s almost impossible for the artist not to engage with the public today, and so the standards of privacy have lowered. These days, using a painting of yourself as an album cover (Lorde) or limiting press interviews (Frank Ocean) seems to count as mystery.But what has increased in the age of distraction is our concern for the necessary conditions in which art could flourish. No longer can the world be kept at bay with the closing of a door; Woolf\u2019s room of her own is now wired for internet. To look at my shelves of favorite novels written in feverish solitude and think that they might never have come to pass is also to know there must be many more today that are simply not being written. And so the greater truths found in solitude \u2014 in nature, like the Romantics\u2019 \u201cthoughts of more deep seclusion,\u201d or in a country in which you don\u2019t speak the language, in which no one knows your name \u2014 have never felt more rare and hard-won. The hermit sits alone no longer; he has a Facebook page to update.What has endured in the act of creation is the idea of getting lost in order to be found in art. This negotiation can also go terribly wrong: Nell Stevens\u2019s darkly funny memoir, \u201cBleaker House,\u201d recounts the six weeks she spent in one of the most remote parts of the Falkland Islands with the hopes of writing a novel, only to find herself watching \u201cEat Pray Love\u201d over and over again and making lists of things she would Google if she could. Isolation has a way of becoming its own subject. But then I think of Howard Axelrod\u2019s \u201cThe Point of Vanishing,\u201d the extraordinary book he wrote about the two years he spent alone in a wooded Vermont cabin after losing the vision in one eye. \u201cSome people say solitude is their biggest fantasy; some say it\u2019s their biggest fear,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cBut when I ask why, they all give the same reason: hearing themselves think.\u201dThe desire to uncover our one true voice, the dread of hearing what it has to say: This seems to me the tension of modern life, the thing that has us searching for a cell signal on yoga retreat. Being in a place where nothing has an agenda for your attention, as Axelrod found, means looking and listening in an unguarded way. \u201cNatural curiosities and affinities emerge,\u201d as he puts it, \u201cbecoming the filters for experience.\u201d How we breathe in the world, then, defaults to a function of an unbidden part of identity, rather than a function of what others want us to be \u2014 or, perhaps even more crucially, how we want others to think we are.Elena Ferrante, the Italian author whose pseudonymity became part of her mystique, once wrote to me in an email interview, \u201cIf my book were publicly mine from the beginning, I would be careful not to damage my image, I would censor myself.\u201d Writing was a \u201cbattle against lying. Only with the confidence of anonymity can I decide occasionally to publish. In the end, if I\u2019m forced to choose, I prefer to lose the role of writer rather than spoil my passion for writing \u2014 that\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been.\u201d When she was allegedly unmasked by an Italian investigative journalist, her fans were outraged at the violation. It was invasive, they argued, which it was, but it seemed to me that not only were they defending Ferrante from the indignity of having her financial and real-estate records unveiled, they were also defending their own right not to know, to be free to imagine that she was, in fact, Elena Greco, the narrator of her Neapolitan Novels, the woman they knew with the intimacy and deep interiority only possible in literature.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Ford Turn Itself Into a Tech Company?", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "Mcity, as the facility is known, was built by the University of Michigan as a testing ground for automakers, including Ford, which has been experimenting with self-driving cars here for about two years. I parked my rental and climbed into the back of a white Ford Fusion with four spinning Lidar sensors on the roof, each roughly the size of a water glass, and a rack of high-performance computers in the trunk. Next to me sat Randy Visintainer, Ford\u2019s director of autonomous vehicle development. Jakob Hoellerbauer, a young Ford engineer, took the driver\u2019s seat. Wayne Williams, a Ford research scientist, sat beside him in the passenger seat typing on a laptop. We put on our seatbelts, and Hoellerbauer hit the ignition and pulled into the road. A beep came from the dashboard, indicating that the car was ready to engage self-driving mode. Hoellerbauer pushed a button on the steering wheel and took his hands away.\u201cWe are now autonomous,\u201d Williams announced.The car glided along Main Street to a four-way stop, waited for another car (driven by a researcher) to clear the intersection, then made a gentle right turn. Autonomous cars are programmed to drive conservatively, and any time our Fusion sensed an approaching object \u2014 like a Ford employee, role-playing an oblivious pedestrian \u2014 it slowed down until it was sure the path was clear, then proceeded cautiously. It felt like being chauffeured by an elderly ghost.Two minutes into the drive, the car pulled around a traffic circle and up to a blinking red light at an empty intersection. It stopped. A few seconds passed. Perhaps, I thought, it was just being characteristically risk-averse. Then a few more seconds passed, and the engineers started to look nervous. Williams squinted at his laptop.\u201cSo right now, we\u2019re not sure if the intersection is clear, so we\u2019re being very cautious,\u201d Williams said, speaking for the car. \u201cIt\u2019s expecting ...\u201d He trailed off and turned to Hoellerbauer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just overtake it?\u201d Hoellerbauer grabbed the wheel and tapped the gas pedal, overriding the self-driving system and manually steering us through the intersection.\u201cWe didn\u2019t see that happen this morning,\u201d Williams explained, by way of an apology. We took another lap around Mcity, and when we reached the intersection again, the car did the exact same thing.Self-driving cars raise the specter of horrific malfunctions \u2014 a code glitch that sends a car careering off a cliff, a remote hack that disables the brakes \u2014 but perfectly innocuous problems like the one we experienced will be far more common, and no less an impediment to road-readiness. There are dozens of autonomous vehicles being tested all over the world \u2014 43 companies are testing 295 different self-driving vehicles in California alone \u2014 and not one of them has a clean record. A self-driving Uber vehicle zoomed through a red light in San Francisco last year. The sensors on cars used by Waymo, the self-driving-car division of Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent, have struggled in heavy rain and snow. I\u2019ve had half a dozen self-driving-car experiences in my life, including a white-knuckle trip down Manhattan\u2019s West Side Highway in a Tesla Model X whose owner had set it to \u201cautopilot\u201d mode, and I wouldn\u2019t describe any of them as relaxing.How quickly these rides will improve depends on whom you ask. Silicon Valley futurists, in typically sanguine fashion, predict that we are months, not years, away from a Cambrian explosion of autonomous cars. Waymo has a pilot program for its self-driving vehicles already underway in Arizona and says it\u2019s \u201creally close\u201d to being fully operational. Lyft, which has partnered with a start-up called Drive.ai, is aiming to have a fleet of self-driving cars operating in the Bay Area by the end of the year. And Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, which has offered semiautonomous features since 2015, has suggested that its cars could be fully autonomous as soon as 2019.But that\u2019s California, where optimism is the coin of the realm. In Detroit, the timeline looks slower and more incremental. Ford, in particular, believes that the first generation of driverless cars will be limited, capable of traveling only in commercial fleets inside carefully plotted urban areas. Other cars will simply get smarter without being autonomous, with features like collision prevention and self-parking becoming more common. Self-driving technology will eventually be more sophisticated and will one day be capable of full door-to-door autonomy in every possible area and condition, but as Ford sees it, that\u2019s not going to happen overnight, or even very soon.Despite its pragmatic restraint, Ford has invested hundreds of millions in self-driving cars and is making surprising progress. In a report earlier this year, Navigant Research placed Ford at the top of its leader board, ahead of tech companies like Waymo and Uber as well as auto rivals like GM and Toyota, based on Ford\u2019s advanced manufacturing capabilities coupled with its strides in software development. The report generated headlines like, \u201cDetroit Is Kicking Silicon Valley\u2019s Ass in the Race to Build Self-Driving Cars,\u201d and delivered a morale boost to Ford, which showed up late but finally felt as if it had a chance.Ford\u2019s big, blinking target is 2021 \u2014 the year it hopes to release a vehicle that meets the Society of Automotive Engineers International\u2019s definition of Level 4 autonomy (no human operator required in the area and conditions it\u2019s programmed for). It\u2019s a tough deadline for a company whose culture might be the exact opposite of Silicon Valley\u2019s, where companies release half-finished \u201cminimum viable products\u201d and abide by maxims like \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d Before Ford \u2014 or any conventional automaker \u2014 produces anything, each part has to pass a grueling battery of tests and certifications. There is a reason \u201cautomotive grade\u201d has become a synonym for \u201creliable.\u201d \u201cOur vehicles have to be a trusted product,\u201d Chris Brewer, Ford\u2019s chief engineer for autonomous vehicles, told me. \u201cThat is a little more important than \u2018Did my phone freeze or not?\u2019\u2009\u201dAmericans are wary of driverless cars \u2014 56 percent, according to the Pew Research Center, would prefer not to ride in one \u2014 and when I talked to Brewer, it occurred to me that some part of that hesitation might stem from who we assume will be producing them: Silicon Valley tech giants, the same stateless behemoths that have spent the last few decades barging into old-line industries like the Kool-Aid Man, destroying working-class jobs and leaving behind cold, modern efficiency. But maybe these skeptics could be persuaded to trust Detroit. After all, Brewer is right \u2014 self-driving cars aren\u2019t smartphones. They\u2019re two-ton projectiles that take your parents to the grocery store and your kids to soccer practice, that will need to make billions of computational decisions per second while moving at 65 miles per hour, that contain within them the power to extinguish human life. You kind of want them to take a while.Leading Ford into this weird new era is Jim Hackett, who was named chief executive in May. Hackett, 62, is an oddity by Detroit standards. A design-minded aesthete in an industry dominated by gearheads and number crunchers, he spent two decades running Steelcase, a Michigan-based office-furniture company whose designers are often credited with \u2014 or blamed for \u2014 popularizing the open-plan office trend.At a conference several years ago, Hackett struck up a conversation with Ford\u2019s executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., who goes by Bill. He is the great-grandson of Henry Ford, and another auto-world misfit \u2014 an outspoken environmentalist who once ruffled feathers at Ford by speaking at a Greenpeace event. The two bonded over their shared vision of \u201csmart mobility,\u201d a fuzzy term, more common among urbanists than businesspeople, for creating a sort of harmony among land use, technology and transportation of all forms. Hackett joined Ford\u2019s board of directors in 2013. In 2016, Bill Ford persuaded Hackett to lead Ford\u2019s newly created smart-mobility unit, and about a year later, he tapped him to run the entire company.Hackett\u2019s jockish C.V. \u2014 he played football at Michigan and briefly ran the school\u2019s athletic department \u2014 masks his high-minded streak, which can make talking to him feel like taking a college philosophy seminar after a few bong rips. In the early 2000s, he began traveling to the Santa Fe Institute, a research group started by prominent scientists who wanted to study \u201ccomplex adaptive systems\u201d \u2014 a branch of theoretical physics that imagines the world as a series of complicated networks that are governed by universal laws and patterns, the same way biology is guided by Darwinian evolution. The rules that explained how anthills formed, they believed, might also explain urbanization trends in Southeast Asia or predict economic cycles. It was a formative experience for Hackett, who began to believe that businesses were governed by universal laws, too.Hackett also became obsessed with \u201cdesign thinking,\u201d a new-agey management philosophy that has become trendy in recent years. Adherents believe that instead of optimizing for profit, organizations should put human emotion at the center of every strategy decision and begin by empathizing with their customers. \u201cNo technology ever evolves without the human interpreting and altering it,\u201d Hackett says. \u201cEvery new technology, the science and the engineering of it, has to give way to human understanding and use.\u201dHackett is only six months into the chief-executive job, but his mannerisms have already entered Ford\u2019s bloodstream. I arrived in Dearborn expecting to talk about drivetrains and crankshafts, but in a series of interviews with nearly a dozen executives, barely anyone mentioned cars or trucks at all. Instead, I heard the Ford Motor Company described as a \u201cmobility solutions provider\u201d that engages in \u201cmultimodal journey planning.\u201d People spoke about \u201cwhiteboarding\u201d and \u201cblue-skying\u201d big ideas. I watched a video that described Ford\u2019s efforts to build a \u201cholistic, organic, interconnected system powered by a transportation operating system.\u201dIt is bizarre to watch an all-American manufacturing company get brain-snatched like this. Even the company\u2019s new internal mission statement bears Hackett\u2019s woolly imprint: \u201cTo become the world\u2019s most trusted mobility company by designing smart vehicles for a smart world.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly \u201cBuilt Ford Tough.\u201d But it\u2019s very much in keeping with Hackett\u2019s worldview, in which everything exists in connection with everything else, and changing one piece of a system necessarily changes the whole. A car learns to drive itself, and a city\u2019s transportation grid shifts around it.This kind of big-picture futurism is necessary in Detroit today, where automakers are frantically reinventing themselves to stay ahead of what they fear might be coming. The average personal vehicle is driven less than an hour per day. But self-driving cars can, in theory, pick up and drop off passengers all day, which significantly reduces the number of cars a community needs. (Researchers at the University of Michigan estimate that autonomous vehicles could cause car ownership to drop by as much as 43 percent. Lyft, which has a horse in the race, cites research estimating that as many as 80 percent of cars could eventually be eliminated.) And because much of the value of self-driving cars lies in the software that runs them, companies that make only hardware \u2014 known in the business as \u201coriginal equipment manufacturers,\u201d or O.E.M.s \u2014 are likely to be squeezed, or worse.Faced with visions of a bleak future as low-margin widget-builders for Silicon Valley, automakers have spent the past several years trying to catch up. General Motors spent $581 million to buy Cruise Automation, a self-driving-technology start-up. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles struck a deal with Waymo, in addition to partnering with BMW and Intel. Daimler and Volvo each joined with Uber, and Toyota set up a whole research institute in Silicon Valley to build its own self-driving vehicles.Ford\u2019s plans might be the most ambitious. It wants to have a hand in every part of the self-driving-car industry, including the software that replaces the human driver, the platform that connects and controls the cars and the services that spring up around them. To that end, Ford has spent the past several years quietly snapping up tech talent. It struck a partnership with Lyft and acquired Chariot, a San Francisco-based start-up that runs group shuttles for commuters. It set up an office in Palo Alto that now has 205 employees and created Greenfield Labs, a business incubator. It invested in Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based artificial-intelligence start-up, and several other companies, including Velodyne, which makes Lidar sensors, and a connected-car software outfit called Autonomic.Most industry observers believe these are the right moves for Ford to be making. But it\u2019s still tough to reconcile today\u2019s Ford \u2014 which makes money by selling millions of combustion-engine trucks and S.U.V.s every year, along with a handful of sedans and hybrids \u2014 with the eco-tech-mobility conglomerate Hackett envisions it becoming. One lesson Hackett learned from his studies is that in order to stay competitive, businesses often have to give up the things that made them great in the first place. (He calls this the \u201cperversity law.\u201d) I asked him if this meant that Ford would need to stop manufacturing conventional, gas-powered vehicles to survive.\u201cWell, part of that statement might be right,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He clarified, sort of: \u201cI\u2019m really just trying to say the better form of problem solving is to abstract the problems.\u201dSo let\u2019s try abstracting Ford\u2019s problems, to see how they might be solved. First: Ford was born at the beginning of a now-outmoded era of industrial production, one that it arguably ushered in. Back then, companies like Ford simply manufactured goods, and customers bought them. Those transactions represented a change of ownership \u2014 a customer who bought a car from Ford was free to install 15-inch subwoofers in it, or paint it bright yellow, or use it in a demolition derby \u2014 and they were typically one-time sales. Ford\u2019s responsibility for the car, and its opportunity to make a profit, ended the minute the warranty ran out.The internet changed that, by allowing companies to wrap physical goods in digital services that can be sold again and again, at much higher margins. Instead of selling servers to corporate I.T. departments, Amazon sells them time shares on a centralized server farm; instead of buying pricey home solar panels, customers can lease them from a solar service, paying for only the power they use. Makers of thermostats, baby monitors and other household gadgets \u201cextend the value chain\u201d by charging customers a monthly fee for information about their home energy use or their babies\u2019 sleep patterns. Even the language these new enterprises use is different. Goods-based businesses spoke in terms of revenues and profits. Service-based businesses count metrics like \u201cchurn,\u201d \u201caverage revenue per user\u201d and \u201clifetime value\u201d \u2014 the total amount of money they can wring from a customer.This phenomenon \u2014 which is sometimes referred to as \u201ceverything as a service,\u201d abbreviated as XaaS and pronounced \u201czass,\u201d among the kinds of people who say these things out loud \u2014 has quietly reshaped the entire economy. Trucking companies that once bought Michelin tires now rent them through a pay-per-mile service. Airlines that buy $15 million jet engines from General Electric can subscribe to OnPoint, a \u201cpower by the hour\u201d program that includes maintenance costs and data-analysis tools. G.E. Aviation now makes the better part of its revenue from services like these.The auto industry was slow to come to grips with this new model \u2014 in part because it long ago gave away the entire service piece of its business to gas stations, body shops, Jiffy Lubes and a hundred other barnacle industries. Thanks to old and byzantine state laws, most carmakers aren\u2019t even allowed to sell or lease directly to their customers \u2014 every transaction has to go through an independent dealer. When it comes to data, automakers are flying blind. As Reilly P. Brennan, a venture capitalist who invests in self-driving technology, put it to me: \u201cThe urinal in the men\u2019s bathroom knows more about its users than most carmakers in 2017.\u201dWith self-driving cars, automakers see a chance to fix that. Ford\u2019s executives talk hopefully about one day offering their own suite of software inside their autonomous vehicles, and building interfaces that companies like Netflix and Skype could plug into. They don\u2019t see themselves usurping Silicon Valley, exactly, but they do see themselves playing in the same league. \u201cTwo to three years ago, the tech community was holding the auto industry at arm\u2019s length,\u201d said Ken Washington, Ford\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cThey thought we were sort of this curious industry that they could come into and disrupt.\u201d He went on: \u201cNow, when I go to Silicon Valley and I interact with tech companies, it\u2019s a dynamic of much more intense interest in collaborating with us.\u201dCollaboration takes many forms, of course, and not all tech companies seem interested in an equal partnership. John Krafcik, the chief executive of Waymo, told me that while traditional auto companies \u201cbring a lot to the party\u201d in terms of hardware expertise, they\u2019re not well equipped to solve the software-based problem of replacing a human driver, which requires huge teams of highly skilled engineers and tremendous amounts of technological infrastructure \u2014 the kinds of tools available to only a Google sibling company. \u201cThe self-driving aspect is really supercomplicated,\u201d Krafcik said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last nine years trying to solve that puzzle. It requires a lot of skills.\u201d It also requires focus, which is a problem for companies that still sell millions of conventional cars and trucks a year, that have thousands of employees to pay and quarterly results to deliver, that can\u2019t exactly drop everything and become software companies.In Detroit, cautious optimism prevails. But outside Detroit, there are real doubts that any auto company can transform itself quickly enough. \u201cAutonomous vehicles are not an incremental shift,\u201d said Carol Reiley, a founder of Drive.ai. \u201cIt\u2019s a very transformative shift, almost like moving from the horse and carriage to the car.\u201d Like many tech executives, Reiley saw Detroit\u2019s quest to control the self-driving-car industry as tactically sound but ultimately a long shot. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they can make it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of baggage.\u201dA week after my Detroit trip, I visited the Pittsburgh offices of Argo AI, the artificial-intelligence start-up that is creating the software brains for Ford\u2019s self-driving vehicles. Ford is investing $1 billion for a majority stake and controls two of Argo\u2019s five board seats. Which means that Argo is an independent company, but only barely \u2014 40 of its 230 employees are transfers from Ford, and Ford is its only corporate partner.Argo\u2019s headquarters is in Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District, a formerly industrial area just outside downtown that has become a center of driverless-car activity. (Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Group is down the street.) Its office is a high-ceilinged space in a modern office building with conference rooms named for famous scientists: Planck, Descartes, Hopper. When I arrived, engineers were eating catered lunch at their standing desks. Squint and ignore the smokestacks outside, and you could be in San Francisco \u2014 which is sort of the point. Ford wants Argo to look and feel like a nimble tech start-up, not a subsidiary of a century-old auto company.I was greeted by Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander, Argo AI\u2019s founders, both well-known figures in the small self-driving-car world. They had been special-faculty members at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s prestigious robotics-engineering program, and Salesky competed in the 2007 Darpa Urban Challenge, a storied self-driving-vehicle race whose alumni now populate the top ranks of the autonomous-vehicle industry. Salesky went to Google to build self-driving cars; Rander went to Uber. They quit their jobs and started Argo AI in November of last year, and in February, with no real product to speak of, and hardly any employees, they announced that they had raised huge sums of money from Ford.The day before my visit, Salesky made waves with a bombastic post on the company\u2019s blog, in which he accused the autonomous-vehicle industry of overselling its progress. \u201cThose who think fully self-driving vehicles will be ubiquitous on city streets months from now or even in a few years,\u201d he wrote, \u201care not well connected to the state of the art or committed to the safe deployment of the technology.\u201d It was a rare role reversal \u2014 the software engineer throwing up caution flags \u2014 and, perhaps, evidence that Ford is trying to stall for time. Officially, Argo is still aiming for Ford\u2019s 2021 target, but Salesky waffled on the firmness of that deadline, saying there\u2019s a chance a true Level 4 autonomous vehicle could be finished later, or possibly sooner. \u201cIt\u2019s ready when it\u2019s ready,\u201d he told me.Salesky freely admitted that he is playing catch-up. Ford won\u2019t share statistics about its self-driving test cars, but public records from California give some sense of what it\u2019s up against. Last year, Ford, which does most of its testing in Michigan and Arizona, logged just 590 autonomous miles in the state, while Waymo\u2019s vehicles logged 635,867 miles. Argo is also building its code from scratch and doesn\u2019t have access to the digital infrastructure that competitors like Waymo and Uber do. \u201cWe\u2019re not out there trying to tell everyone we\u2019re going to be first or beat X, Y or Z company,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cThe goal is to get to market with something that can scale up.\u201dIn order to work properly, a self-driving car also has to understand how humans behave. It needs to know the difference between a car that is idling in the right-hand lane (in which case the autonomous vehicle should steer around it) and one that is about to parallel park (in which case the vehicle should stay in its lane, giving the other car some room). It needs to predict that the jogger running toward the corner will stop for traffic, but that the kid running to chase a basketball might not. It needs to be able to navigate a four-way stop, which in polite parts of the country involves lots of eye contact and you-first hand gestures. \u201cThis goes beyond just seeing and understanding the world,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cIt means understanding what each of the actors in the world is going to do.\u201dIn other words, driving isn\u2019t just a mechanical task \u2014 it\u2019s a social act, and in order to coexist with human drivers, self-driving cars will need to develop a level of social awareness that approaches that of a full-fledged A.I. This is why some computer scientists think Waymo is going to be unbeatable. As an Alphabet company, Waymo has access to some of the best engineering talent in A.I., along with Google\u2019s enormous data troves and the machine-learning systems that have been trained using that data. In other words, the vast data-harvesting powers that make Google\u2019s consumer products so creepy could also make Waymo\u2019s vehicles better at navigating the physical world.But all this obsessive focus on tech elides a much more foundational question about our relationship to cars. Tech companies tend to view driving as a functional problem \u2014 get safely from Point A to Point B as quickly as possible \u2014 in which the vehicle itself is largely an extraneous variable. A car might begin its life as a Toyota or a Hyundai, but once it\u2019s autonomous and on a ride-sharing network, it\u2019s just an Uber. Silicon Valley believes that software, not hardware, is what matters to riders, and this will be especially true of self-driving cars \u2014 which, at least in early days, will most likely be shared among strangers.But Detroit has spent decades and billions of advertising dollars persuading us that its mass-produced cars are anything but homogeneous metal boxes \u2014 that they carry profound talismanic qualities that transfer to their owners. You can be an F-150 woman or a Mustang man, and those choices signal tribal affiliations that extend far past the act of driving. Ford\u2019s challenge, then, is keeping these storied brands alive for the consumers who still obsess over them, while Argo builds the software that will satisfy the car-agnostic city dwellers. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act, made even more complicated by the politics of a 114-year-old Detroit manufacturing company lashing its fate to a one-year-old Pittsburgh tech start-up, and vice versa. \u201cThey\u2019ve put a lot of trust in us,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also put a lot of trust in them.\u201dBill Ford has been working in the family business for 38 years and spent most of that time as an iconoclast. His interest in \u201csmart mobility\u201d \u2014 which amounts to an interest in reducing the number of cars on the road \u2014 was until recently considered heretical. But the past few years have vindicated his predictions. He thinks that the coming convergence of tech and transportation could turn Detroit and Silicon Valley into permanent collaborators. He started Fontinalis Partners, a venture-capital fund outside Ford, to invest in mobility start-ups, and flies regularly to San Francisco to meet with entrepreneurs working on transportation-related projects.\u201cThe narrative, probably even two years ago, would have been \u2018tech companies win, autos lose,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened, though, is there\u2019s been a realization that we have a lot more intellectual property than the world realized,\u201d by which he means celebrated lines like the F-150, along with some proprietary under-the-hood technology that I won\u2019t pretend to understand. \u201cSecond, we really know how to integrate a lot of what the tech companies have into our vehicles, and we know how to make vehicles as well.\u201dI was struck by how frequently this simple point is deployed at Ford: We know how to make stuff, and making stuff isn\u2019t easy. At first, I dismissed it as a na\u00efve attempt to steer a conversation about Detroit\u2019s shortcomings back toward its strengths. Apple taught suppliers halfway across the world how to make iPhones with micron-level precision \u2014 how hard could it be to slap some metal together and put it on wheels?But making cars isn\u2019t like making other things. It\u2019s a dizzying logistical ballet that involves heavy machinery, grueling labor and countless opportunities for error. It\u2019s wrangling union contracts while keeping the line moving. It\u2019s paying people enough to ensure that they won\u2019t miss a loose bolt and kill someone. It\u2019s designing objects that not only work well but also fill a psychological need for buyers. In the end, maybe the self-driving-car race will be decided not purely on technological achievement, but also on these much more prosaic questions \u2014 who can make good things and persuade people to use them? After all, the Model T wasn\u2019t the first car invented, or the best at the time. But it was accessible and functional and spoke to people\u2019s needs in a simple way during a time of confusing technological change. That conversation is about to begin again.Kevin Roose is a business-and-technology columnist for The Times and a writer at large for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Who Is \u2018Harry Clarke,\u2019 and Why Is He So Appealing?", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Harry Clarke humblebrags that the singer Sade is \u201cabout the most real person I know,\u201d you believe him. If anyone\u2019s an expert on real people, he is.That\u2019s because he\u2019s a fake.No, he\u2019s just Philip Brugglestein, Illinois born and Indiana bred and very good at Google. Never been to London, works as a barista. But what a story he has to tell.Among those gifts is the ability to build a performance from various angles at once, as if in a trifold dressing-room mirror. Mr. Crudup plays not only Philip \u2014 and Philip as his alter ego, Harry \u2014 but also dozens of people who pass through their lives. He doesn\u2019t impersonate those people, exactly, but sketches them for us as they might be seen through Harry\u2019s or Philip\u2019s eyes. In other words, he uses the secondary characters to characterize the main ones.In the first part of the play, those supporting characters include sad young Philip\u2019s alcoholic father and overwhelmed mother, both of them bewildered by the emergence of their \u201cpansy\u201d son\u2019s new persona at age 8. (Not many American third graders say \u201cDon\u2019t get your knickers in a twist, darlin\u2019.\u201d) Mr. Crudup gives the father, who is verbally and physically abusive, a flat Midwestern accent that seems all the more brutal in contrast to Philip\u2019s jaunty Brit speak \u2014 and hints at why he adopted it.At other times, especially after Philip moves to New York City and lets the insouciant Harry off the leash, the characters we meet through him are rendered more satirically. (If you don\u2019t know what a Hanukkah Brazilian is, go and learn.) It\u2019s an especially neat trick that in portraying several members of one family \u2014 the wealthy Schmidts, whom Harry infiltrates \u2014 they in turn are portraying him. Their infatuation, based though it is on credulousness, shows us how confident and attractive he\u2019s become.Because we\u2019ve seen where he started, we cannot disapprove too much of Harry as he attains comforts and companionship that Philip never could. One of the best things about the play is that for a long time it leaves us bamboozled into believing, despite the evidence of our senses, that they are different people.The realization that the \u201ctwo\u201d men are actually one \u2014 a realization that they must face as well \u2014 eventually forces us to confront some rather large issues about the construction of identity. If Philip can become Harry just by acting like him, does that not mean Harry was always inside him? Is personality really so multiple and mutable? What about sexuality and morality?These questions keep the play leaping forward, as Harry tests the edges of his fabulous new life. But in the last quarter, when he goes too far, so does Mr. Cale. The minute you feel the action straining toward an existential climax, you start to resist any further manipulation.He needn\u2019t have. Mr. Crudup has a natural sense of drama that needs no underlining. His vulpine charm \u2014 look out for those bright teeth! \u2014 makes it impossible not to like him, even as he grows alarming.Of course, the whole play is set in a theater. One of the meta-delights of \u201cHarry Clarke\u201d is the way it applies the idea of performance to regular life. As Harry proves, we\u2019re all actors, working with whatever rickety materials we\u2019ve got. If only we were all as good at impersonation as he and Mr. Crudup are, we might even be happy.Tickets powered by TicketmastervideoAdvertisement"}

And though it has remained under the radar until now, those four quantum projects have another notable competitor: Robert Schoelkopf.After their research helped fuel the work of so many others, Mr. Schoelkopf and two other Yale professors have started their own quantum computing company, Quantum Circuits.Based just down the road from Yale in New Haven, Conn., and backed by $18 million in funding from the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and others, the start-up is another sign that quantum computing \u2014 for decades a distant dream of the world\u2019s computer scientists \u2014 is edging closer to reality.\u201cIn the last few years, it has become apparent to us and others around the world that we know enough about this that we can build a working system,\u201d Mr. Schoelkopf said. \u201cThis is a technology that we can begin to commercialize.\u201dQuantum computing systems are difficult to understand because they do not behave like the everyday world we live in. But this counterintuitive behavior is what allows them to perform calculations at rate that would not be possible on a typical computer.Today\u2019s computers store information as \u201cbits,\u201d with each transistor holding either a 1 or a 0. But thanks to something called the superposition principle \u2014 behavior exhibited by subatomic particles like electrons and photons, the fundamental particles of light \u2014 a quantum bit, or \u201cqubit,\u201d can store a 1 and a 0 at the same time. This means two qubits can hold four values at once. As you expand the number of qubits, the machine becomes exponentially more powerful.The trouble is that storing information in a quantum system for more than a short amount of time is very difficult, and this short \u201ccoherence time\u201d leads to errors in calculations. But over the past two decades, Mr. Schoelkopf and other physicists have worked to solve this problem using what are called superconducting circuits. They have built qubits from materials that exhibit quantum properties when cooled to extremely low temperatures.\u201cSchoelkopf\u2019s Law started as a joke, but now we use it in many of our research papers,\u201d said Isaac Chuang, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cNo one expected this would be possible, but the improvement has been exponential.\u201dThese superconducting circuits have become the primary area of quantum computing research across the industry. One of Mr. Schoelkopf\u2019s former students now leads the quantum computing program at IBM. The founder of Rigetti Computing studied with Michel Devoret, one of the other Yale professors behind Quantum Circuits.In recent months, after grabbing a team of top researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, Google indicated it is on the verge of using this method to build a machine that can achieve \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d \u2014 when a quantum machine performs a task that would be impossible on your laptop or any other machine that obeys the laws of classical physics.The belief is that quantum machines will eventually analyze the interactions between physical molecules with a precision that is not possible today, something that could radically accelerate the development of new medications. Google and others also believe that these systems can significantly accelerate machine learning, the field of teaching computers to learn tasks on their own by analyzing data or experiments with certain behavior.A quantum computer could also be able to break the encryption algorithms that guard the world\u2019s most sensitive corporate and government data. With so much at stake, it is no surprise that so many companies are betting on this technology, including start-ups like Quantum Circuits.The deck is stacked against the smaller players, because the big-name companies have so much more money to throw at the problem. But start-ups have their own advantages, even in such a complex and expensive area of research.\u201cSmall teams of exceptional people can do exceptional things,\u201d said Bill Coughran, who helped oversee the creation of Google\u2019s vast internet infrastructure and is now investing in Mr. Schoelkopf\u2019s company as a partner at Sequoia. \u201cI have yet to see large teams inside big companies doing anything tremendously innovative.\u201dThough Quantum Circuits is using the same quantum method as its bigger competitors, Mr. Schoelkopf argued that his company has an edge because it is tackling the problem differently. Rather than building one large quantum machine, it is constructing a series of tiny machines that can be networked together. He said this will make it easier to correct errors in quantum calculations \u2014 one of the main difficulties in building one of these complex machines.But each of the big companies insist that they hold an advantage \u2014 and each is loudly trumpeting its progress, even if a working machine is still years away.Mr. Coughran said that he and Sequoia envision Quantum Circuits evolving into a company that can deliver quantum computing to any business or researcher that needs it. Another investor, Canaan\u2019s Brendan Dickinson, said that if a company like this develops a viable quantum machine, it will become a prime acquisition target.\u201cThe promise of a large quantum computer is incredibly powerful,\u201d Mr. Dickinson said. \u201cIt will solve problems we can\u2019t even imagine right now.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of one of the investors in Quantum Circuits. As correctly noted elsewhere in the article, he is Brendan Dickinson, not Dickson.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Intelligence Committee Releases Incendiary Russian Social Media Ads", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 During the day\u2019s first hearing, senators trained their attacks on Facebook, whose general counsel was careful about acknowledging the company\u2019s role as a tool for Russia\u2019s misinformation campaign during the election.\u2022 The House Intelligence Committee also released dozens of advertisements that Russia-linked firms created during the 2016 campaign.Here are the highlights:After months of oblique references to the divisive nature of Russia-linked digital advertising, the House Intelligence Committee released a slew of ad examples and account names that were targeted at American voters during the 2016 election.The ads \u2014 all of which were enlarged, printed out and splayed out across the committee floor on a series of poster boards \u2014 spanned the gamut of contentious social issues touching on race, religion and political affiliation.One ad from \u201cSouth United,\u201d a now-suspended Facebook group, depicted a Confederate Flag with accompanying text: \u201cHeritage, not hate. The South will rise again!\u201d The ad, created in October of 2016, cost approximately $1,300 and garnered roughly 40,000 clicks.Representatives also noted that some ads, including one from the account \u201cTEN_GOP,\u201d were shared by members of the Trump campaign and administration, including Kelly Anne Conway, Michael Flynn and President Trump\u2019s son, Donald J. Trump Jr.\u201cWhether knowingly or unknowingly, they helped legitimize and spread Russian disinformation,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut.One ad from a Facebook account called \u201cBack the Badge\u201d saw more than 1.3 million impressions and more than 73,000 likes.The timing and content of the ads were no accident. Last year, as the Black Lives Matter protest movement gained steam, the Internet Research Agency in Russia created groups that supported the movement \u2014 like the far-reaching account \u201cBlacktivists\u201d \u2014 and opposed to it, like \u201cBack the Badge.\u201d That suggested a surgical deployment of incendiary content across all three platforms with the aim of dividing Americans at critical moments in the election season.\u201cIt was undertaken by people who understand social media,\u201d Facebook\u2019s general counsel, Colin Stretch said, referring to the Russian agencies who created the accounts. \u201cThese people were not amateurs.\u201dLawmakers used a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee to stake partisan positions on the legitimacy of the 2016 presidential campaign, either defending President Trump\u2019s election or asserting that his narrow victory could have been delivered by Russian efforts on social media.Republicans strongly pushed back on the idea that Facebook, Google, and Twitter were responsible for the election results.\u201cA lot of folks, including many in the media, have tried to reduce this entire conversation down to one premise: foreign actors conducted a surgically executed covert operation to help elect a United States president,\u201d said Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the committee. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, emphasized that the real intent of Russian propaganda was to generally spread misinformation and chaos.\u201cThese operations, they\u2019re not limited to 2016 and not limited to the presidential race, and they continue to this day. They are much more widespread than one election,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.Democrats, however, trained their remarks on the direct connection between Russian activity and the election.\u201cThe Russians created Facebook pages, posted YouTube videos, all trying to appeal to specific audiences,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat from Oregon, said.The partisan dynamics put the social media companies in a difficult position, and Facebook wouldn\u2019t take a side.\u201cWe\u2019ve provided all the information we can about the content that we\u2019ve identified on the system,\u201d said Mr. Stretch, suggesting that the committee assess \u201call of the online and offline activity that would be necessary to effectuate a campaign.\u201dSenator Martin Heinrich, Democrat from New Mexico, aimed at Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissal of the role of social media in his win.\u201cLast month President Trump called Russian purchased Facebook ads a hoax. I\u2019ve looked at those Russian sponsored Facebook ads. I certainly hope you\u2019ve had a chance to review them. Are they, in fact, a hoax?\u201d Mr. Heinrich said.\u201cNo. The existence of those ads were on Facebook, and it was not a hoax,\u201d Mr. Stretch saidRepresentative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, got to the heart of the Facebook and Twitter\u2019s dilemma: its business models are built on generating viral content.\u201cPart of what made the Russia social media campaign successful is that they understood algorithms you use that tend to accentuate content that is either fear-based or anger-based,\u201d said Mr. Schiff, who then asked the companies what their \u201csocietal obligation\u201d is to change those dynamics.The companies pushed back on the idea that their algorithms only reward viral content, which would make the sites vulnerable to the most outrageous posts.\u201cYes we do have an obligation to prevent foreign interference in the election. We take that obligation seriously,\u201d Mr. Stretch of Facebook said. \u201cWith respect to the algorithm, our goal is to provide the most relevant information. It\u2019s primarily driven by friends and family. That\u2019s the core of Facebook.\u201dSenator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has largely spearheaded the effort prodding Facebook into handing over data, immediately went after the social media giant in his questioning.In a seven-minute exchange, most of Mr. Warner\u2019s time was spent dressing down Mr. Stretch for what he characterized as a lack of responsiveness from Facebook as his office repeatedly asked for more data on the extent to which Russian meddling influenced the election.\u201cI have more than a little bit of frustration that many of us on this committee have been raising this issue since the beginning of this year, and our claims were frankly blown off by the leadership of your companies,\u201d Mr. Warner said.Mr. Warner hammered his point with blown-up prints of some of the Facebook posts that circulated. One featured an illustration of Hillary Clinton in a fistfight with a picture of Jesus, an inflammatory ad aimed at riling up conservative Americans.Several senators trained their attacks on Facebook on Wednesday for its inadvertent role in the Russian influence campaign, a repeat of Tuesday\u2019s Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing.\u201cI must say, I don\u2019t think you get it,\u201d said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who was also at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cI went home last night disappointed. I asked specific questions, I got vague answers.\u201dAs senators pressed Facebook\u2019s general counsel on Facebook\u2019s role in the election, one of the hallmarks of Facebook\u2019s explanation has been the issue of \u201cauthentic accounts.\u201dSince Facebook went public with its findings, the company\u2019s reasoning for taking down more than 80,000 fake, Russian-linked ads, was not the type of content they posted, but because those responsible for them had misrepresented who they were when creating the accounts.That distinction is key for Facebook. Outside of some parameters like nudity or incitement to violence, executives at the company are wary of becoming the arbiters of what content is or is not allowed on Facebook, fearing accusations of censorship.\u201cWe don\u2019t take for granted that each one of you uses Facebook to connect with your constituents, and that the people you represent expect authentic experiences when they come to our platform to share,\u201d Mr. Stretch said in his opening remarks on Tuesday.Mr. Burr asked if Facebook would have shut down the 470 Russian-linked accounts if they weren\u2019t fake.\u201cDoes it trouble you it took this committee to look at the authentic nature of the users and the content?\u201d Mr. Burr asked Facebook\u2019s general counsel.Mr. Stretch didn\u2019t directly answer. \u201cThe authenticity issue is the key,\u201d Mr. Stretch said, noting that many of those accounts would have been shut down anyway because they violated other terms of service.Political ads are just part of the problem, Mr. Warner said at Wednesday\u2019s first hearing.Russian agents spread nonpaid content through the creation of pages on Facebook dedicated to hot-button issues like race. On Twitter, the Kremlin-connected internet Research Agency used automatic messaging tools known as bots that could quickly spread tweets through multiple accounts.\u201cFor Facebook, much of the attention has been focused on the paid ads Russian trolls targeted to Americans. However, these ads are just the tip of a very large iceberg,\u201d Mr. Warner said. \u201cThe real story is the amount of misinformation and divisive content that was pushed for free on Russian-backed pages, which then spread widely on the news feeds of tens of millions of Americans.\u201dEarlier this week, Twitter, Facebook and Google revealed new information and numbers showing that foreign interference on their site was worse than they first reported. But the companies all stressed that the amount of Russian propaganda that reached users was just a sliver of the total amount of content their platforms produce every day.But some lawmakers think the companies are holding back information.Twitter said it identified 2,752 accounts controlled by Russian operatives and more than 36,000 \u201cbots\u201d that tweeted 1.4 million times during the election. The company had previously told lawmakers it found only 201 accounts linked to Russia.The new numbers still seem low, according to Mr. Warner.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that Twitter seems to be vastly underestimating the number of fake accounts and bots pushing disinformation. Independent researchers have estimated that up to 15 percent of Twitter accounts \u2013 or potentially 48 million accounts \u2013 are fake or automated,\u201d Mr. Warner said in his opening statement.Mr. Burr also noted the slow reaction by internet companies.With Facebook\u2019s acknowledgment that 126 million people were exposed to Russia-linked content instead of the 10 million people they originally estimated, \u201ctells me that your companies are just beginning to come grips with the scale and the depth of the problem,\u201d Mr. Burr said.\u201cYour actions need to catch up to your responsibilities,\u201d he added.For a second straight day, Ms. Feinstein asked Google why it continues to allow RT to continue to publish videos on YouTube even though a report from the American intelligence community has described RT, formerly known as Russia Today, as the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cprincipal international propaganda outlet.\u201dKent Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, walked a fine line, saying that RT\u2019s influence goes beyond merely YouTube; he noted that RT is available on cable and satellite television packages. It advertises in newspapers and can be found on hotel television channels.Google has reviewed RT\u2019s content and found that no violations to YouTube\u2019s community guidelines, Mr. Walker said. He said that the company provides information about the \u201cgovernment-funded nature\u201d of RT on Google \u2014 presumably on search results \u2014 and said it is considering expanding that to YouTube. He didn\u2019t elaborate how Google plans to do so.On Tuesday in a separate hearing, Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s director of law enforcement and information security, said Google dropped RT from its top advertising tier because of \u201ca drop in viewership\u201d \u2014 not because of its content.Ms. Feinstein said Google\u2019s answers were unsatisfactory. She repeated an earlier admonition of the tech companies: \u201cWe\u2019re in a different day now.\u201d\u2014 Daisuke WakabayashiDespite being located in the San Francisco Bay Area, all of three tech companies position themselves as \u201cglobal platforms.\u201d The internet, as Mr. Stretch noted on Tuesday, is borderless.But the distinction presents a number of problems for the companies, particularly on foreign interference in American elections. Are technology companies beholden to protecting the interests of the nations they reside in? Or do they answer to some higher authority?Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, noted that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks continue to use Twitter and other digital outlets to publish document dumps and email leaks, some of which are damaging to Americans.\u201cIs it biased to side with America against our adversaries?\u201d Mr. Cotton asked, painting Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks as anti-American.Twitter\u2019s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, demurred. \u201cWe try to be unbiased across the world.\u201dRecently, Twitter broke ranks with Google and Facebook in its treatment of Russia Today and Sputnik, state-backed media agencies in Russia. Twitter banned RT and Sputnik from advertising on its platform and donated the funds to external research into how Twitter is used for civic engagement and elections. Facebook and the Google-owned YouTube have not taken the same route, citing that RT and Sputnik have not broken their terms of service agreements.But Twitter\u2019s move puts the company in a difficult position: What if Russia, for example, claims that an American news network is a state-backed propaganda arm in America, and demands that such a network be banned from advertising as well?Top executives for the three companies appeared before a judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday armed with regrets and pledges to do better. The lawmakers appeared to be unimpressed.Facebook came under particularly heavy fire, as senators from both parties pressed the companies on their sluggish responses.\u201cWhy has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem, see it clearly for the problem it is, and begin to work in a responsible way to address it?\u201d Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, asked in one pointed exchange.The senators also raised doubts that efforts outlined by the companies \u2014 Facebook, for instance, said that it would hire more than 1,000 people to review political ad purchases \u2014 would protect the United States from outside influence.\u201cI\u2019m trying to get us down from La-La Land here,\u201d said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. \u201cThe truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month. Every minute. Probably every second. You don\u2019t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?\u201dSenator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, pushed the executives to weigh in on legislation that would require the companies to report who funds political ads online. In response, they suggested voluntary efforts already underway but said they hoped to work with lawmakers on such requirements.The House intelligence committee is expected on Wednesday to publicly release much-anticipated copies of Facebook ads purchased by Russian-linked accounts.Wednesday will be a particularly busy day for Facebook, which will also report its third-quarter earnings at 4 p.m. Eastern, around the middle of the day\u2019s second hearing.The company, which is used by more than 2 billion people worldwide, is expected to post stellar results, with revenues from advertising jumping 41 percent from the same quarter last year to $9.88 billion.With its stock trading at a record high and the company\u2019s market capitalization over $500 billion \u2014 more than the gross domestic product of countries like Columbia and Taiwan \u2014 Facebook\u2019s business success clashes with the posture it will present to lawmakers.To members of Congress, Facebook will be contrite and stress the challenges of fixing its technology to prevent abuse of its site by foreign governments. But to investors, the message this afternoon will be decidedly bullish.That contradiction is at the heart of the problem Facebook is confronting. Its business model, all based on advertising, is largely automated and reward the most viral content, even at the sake of the public interest.According to testimony by the companies, Russian agents spread inflammatory posts that reached 126 million Facebook users, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded more than 1,000 videos to Google\u2019s YouTube service.The latest disclosure will most likely serve to underline complaints among lawmakers that the tech giants have been slow to recognize and react to the significance of the Russian campaign.On Wednesday, Mr. Warner and others are likely to bore into the details of the companies\u2019 internal investigations, questioning their rigor, as well remedies the companies have already volunteered.They will also want to hear about solutions to issues beyond the disclosure of paid political advertising, like the influence of bots and \u201corganic posts\u201d harnessed by foreign powers.\u201cTransparency in advertising alone, however, is not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages,\u201d Mr. Schiff said recently.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Guide to (Somewhat) Painless Thanksgiving Travel", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fear of awkward dinner conversations doesn\u2019t appear to be strong enough to keep folks from visiting their loved ones this Thanksgiving.While alternative modes of transportation (train, bus or boat) are collectively expected to climb about 1.1 percent, or about 1.48 million people, car and air travel remain the two most popular forms of transportation this Thanksgiving season. Here\u2019s what you need to know to avoid the crowds and have as painless a trip as possible via this nation\u2019s roads and airports this Thanksgiving.While these factors are not under any one traveler\u2019s control, when to depart and return can be, and knowing the best times and days to do so can at least save you some road rage.Unless you\u2019re an early riser and can get on the road between 3 and 4 a.m. (local time), you\u2019re better off waiting until Thanksgiving morning and leaving around 6 a.m. The heaviest traffic tends to be between 3 and 4 p.m.The best days and times vary more when it comes to returning home, but mid-to-late afternoon on both Saturday and Sunday are times to avoid.You may see even bigger crowds at the airport this year, as air travel is expected to be up by five percent, or 3.95 million, for the Thanksgiving travel season, according to AAA.\u201cIt looks like a significant number of travelers plan to trade their wheels for wings this year,\u201d George Hobica, the president of Airfarewatchdog.com, said in an email. \u201cPerhaps recent pricing competition amongst legacy and discount carriers alike have people feeling that holiday airfares are attainable, even if they\u2019re pricier \u2014 which they are.\u201dWhatever the reason, travelers should know what to expect when they get to the airport this year, and how best to avoid long waits at check-in and security.AtlantaDeparture Car TrafficBest: Wednesday at 6 a.m.Worst: Wednesday at 3 p.m.Return Car TrafficBest: Saturday at 6 a.m.Worst: Saturday at 4 p.m.AirportHartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the busiest airport in the country for Thanksgiving week, according to Hopper.

{"Headline": "The New Generation of Character Actors", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "Once strictly supporting names, these performers have now emerged as key players in a changing Hollywood.Supported by\u201cA lot,\u201d Gerry replies.\u201cTo who?\u201d Curtis asks.Gerry looks around, gestures weakly at the bar and whispers, \u201cEveryone.\u201d Mendelsohn draws out this line, cracking a proud little smile, which transforms into a nervous grimace \u2014 as if he\u2019s sharing a secret better left unsaid. It\u2019s one of the most impressive eight seconds of film acting in recent years; with a single word, an actor pulls us into his character\u2019s anguished world.All actors play characters, of course, but only some are called \u201ccharacter actors.\u201d The term is contentious \u2014 performers rarely use it to describe their peers \u2014 yet it has persisted for more than a century. It first became common in 19th-century theater criticism to discuss actors who immersed themselves fully in their roles, often using realistic makeup to become unrecognizable. By the 1930s, the term had changed in Hollywood to refer to entertainers who played specific types: Walter Brennan as the leathery old codger, Ward Bond as the avuncular authority figure. \u201cMany character actors had created their archetypes in vaudeville or theater,\u201d says Bruce Goldstein, director of repertory programming at New York\u2019s Film Forum. \u201cHollywood was turning out so many movies that character actors allowed for a kind of shorthand \u2014 you didn\u2019t need a lot of exposition. It\u2019s why films of that era are so breezy.\u201dThese men also injected a note of humanity into what would otherwise have been broad, even stock, roles. \u201cYou recognize something concrete in them,\u201d wrote the critic Gilbert Seldes in a 1934 Esquire essay, \u201cThe Itsy-Bitsy Actors.\u201d Unlike a movie\u2019s charismatic leads, character actors could be \u201crude, violent, ironic, mean, brutal and mocking. They say what the audience often feels.\u201d For this, they didn\u2019t go unnoticed \u2014 Brennan won three Best Supporting Actor Oscars from 1936 to 1940, a feat no actor has since matched. By the 1980s, the definition of a character actor again had shifted, this time to include supporting players who were familiar without being famous: people like Jon Polito, Vincent Schiavelli, Xander Berkeley. (Don\u2019t recognize their names? Google their faces.) Occasionally, if he stuck around long enough, a character actor became an institution unto himself; look no further than the tributes to Harry Dean Stanton \u2014 known for playing grizzled oddballs \u2014 when he died in September.While there are many forces behind the rise of such performers, chief among them is the implosion of Hollywood\u2019s star system over the past two decades. The unchecked increase in movie-star salaries in the 1980s and 1990s led to a reckoning throughout the 2000s, as expensive talents like Harrison Ford, Tom Cruise and Eddie Murphy released films that vastly underperformed. Even Will Smith \u2014 once considered infallible \u2014 has struggled to achieve anything approaching the box-office triumphs of his mid-\u201990s heyday. Studios didn\u2019t respond to these deficits by cutting budgets, though; instead, they pursued increasingly extravagant franchises, many of which were engineered solely to manufacture new celebrities to replace the outdated models. These films varied in quality \u2014 some were admittedly entertaining \u2014 but they were formulaic when it came to plotting and casting.There\u2019s one other reason character actors are ascendant right now: When Hollywood stopped producing scripts of real merit, veteran filmmakers and screenwriters began making \u201cprestige\u201d television, which inadvertently became a training ground for these actors, much as theater once was. \u201cI like to say that television is about character and movies are about story,\u201d says Keith Gordon, an \u201980s-era character actor who now directs television, including \u201cHomeland\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d \u201cWith a film, you ask, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen?\u2019 With a TV show, you ask, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen to this character I like?\u2019\u2009\u201d Only great actors \u2014 those like Mendelsohn, who won a Lead Actor Emmy last year for his role in Netflix\u2019s \u201cBloodline\u201d \u2014 can bring the required depth to roles that are meant to encourage binge-watching: hours, if not days, spent with a character (and a person) who must be compelling enough to sustain the audience\u2019s interest and emotional engagement.Perhaps this isn\u2019t so different from The Itsy-Bitsy Actors that Seldes eulogized almost a century ago. They, too, had the ability to break through the confines of the screen to present feelings that were recognizably human. Yet those original character actors offered a brief respite from the uniformity of Hollywood\u2019s dream machine \u2014 they supported the stars, helped them tell their stories. Today, it\u2019s the character actors who viewers remember long after the rest has faded to black. And the only thing these supporting players are supporting is the weight of the industry itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women Cracked Wartime Codes. They Can Fix Tech Today, Too.", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionBefore she died in 2016 at age 94, Ann Caracristi, the first female deputy director of the National Security Agency, liked to reminisce about the absurd stereotypes that women had to contend with back when she entered public service during World War II. Chief among these \u2014 she found it somewhat amusing \u2014 was the notion that women are not as intellectually gifted as men.More than 70 years after that war ended, it is astonishing to see doubts re-emerge about women\u2019s ability to do high-level intellectual work. Far from being put to rest, old prejudice has found new expression in naysayers like James Damore, the Google engineer, now fired, who suggested in an infamous memo that women are shut out of top jobs in Silicon Valley because they are not \u201cbiologically\u201d suited to the brain work of tech.When most Americans think about our veterans on Veterans Day \u2014 and all too infrequently in between \u2014 they often think of acts of valor as fixed in an earlier era. But the story of our country\u2019s female veterans, pressed into service at a trying time, can tell us a lot about challenges we face today, as can the contributions of those civilian women, like Caracristi, who played a critical role in the wartime military effort.In certain important ways, the early 1940s were a progressive, experimental era in which the military recruited from many quarters. That era can give us clues to performing better in all sectors today. During the worst, costliest, bloodiest war in American history, it was an inclusive mind-set that helped the Allies defeat the Nazis.Women were key to any number of wartime advances, but their presence was crucial in intelligence and communications, as well as in the arena that combines both: signals intelligence, or code breaking. World War II was a war of encrypted signals. As armies and navies fought in distant corners of the globe, combatants developed myriad code and cipher systems to cloak their radio and telegraph communications, and code breaking came into its own as a way to eavesdrop on enemy plans.More than half of the American code-breaking force was female \u2014 roughly 10,000 women. Many were college graduates who had been shut out of graduate schools and excluded from fields such as math and engineering, and who now had a place for their talents.The team labored for more than a year; in September 1940, Grotjan spotted the coincidence that broke the cipher. The breakthrough provided key intelligence for the entire war and those officials privy to the contents called it \u201cMagic.\u201dOnce the attack on Pearl Harbor brought America into the war, the country\u2019s code-breaking offices were enlarged. As men were shipped overseas as fast as ships could get them there, military leaders \u2014 and Congress \u2014 realized that the United States could not staff a multi-ocean war using only men, and so women\u2019s military groups were created.Women went to work in air traffic control towers and, despite fears they would become hysterical in a crisis, kept their wits. In addition to the millions of female factory workers, women ran radios and radar, worked as chemists, bacteriologists and gunnery instructors \u2014 and calculated weapon trajectories.Those who tested high for aptitude were routed into two top-secret code-breaking centers in the Washington area, one for the Army and one for the Navy.It\u2019s not too much of a stretch to say that inclusion \u2014 the willingness to welcome genius \u2014 is one reason the right side won the war. The country also benefited from the contributions of other marginalized groups, including Navajo code talkers, Tuskegee airmen and other black troops (including women) serving in a segregated military.There is a lesson here for the tech bros. Economists have long been mystified by the impulse to discriminate, given that shutting out any group deprives society of advances. Studies show that diverse teams get better results. Inclusion never entails \u201clowering the bar.\u201d It enlarges the pool of talent and brings the best people in.To be sure, even during the war, inclusion was seen as a temporary emergency measure, and the spectacle of tens of thousands of young women boarding trains to the nation\u2019s capital unnerved many. Ads and posters featured plaintive children asking, \u201cMother, when will you stay home again?\u201d After the war, backlash set in. The female code breakers got very little public credit for their achievements, and credit would be a long time coming for towering figures like Grace Hopper. And so here we are: The notion that genius is a male trait has once again raised its head.In today\u2019s rhetorical climate, it\u2019s not just a handful of entitled engineers who feel empowered to impugn certain groups. The same animus lies behind the Trump administration\u2019s eagerness to exclude refugees, and behind the proposed ban on transgender people serving in the military. In gratuitously acting to exclude willing citizens from military service, the president has declined to avail himself of the array of ingenuity and courage this nation has to offer.World War II is a reminder that, when freedom hung in the balance, inclusion kept us safe. It\u2019s also a reminder that our military once took the lead on social change at a time when more families felt connected to military service. Now we are greatly divided. We\u2019re losing a key military edge and could lose a technical one, if we give in to the notion that some groups are more gifted than others. History has shown that exclusion tends to be the approach of, as Donald Trump might put it, the losers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snapchat Remakes Itself, Splitting the Social From the Media", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Wednesday, its parent company, Snap, continued that unconventional approach, unveiling a redesign that effectively separates social and media into two parts of the Snapchat app.Where users of Facebook see one giant news feed of information, typically determined by what they have liked and what their friends post, Snapchat users will now see a left side of the app that includes chats and stories shared with, or by, their friends. That\u2019s the social part. On the right side, there will be content from publishers, amateur creators, celebrities and stories that Snap curates from user-generated videos and photos. That\u2019s the media part.\u201cWhile blurring the lines between professional content creators and your friends has been an interesting internet experiment, it has also produced some strange side effects (like fake news) and made us feel like we have to perform for our friends rather than just express ourselves,\u201d Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, said in a blog post about the redesign, which is to begin rolling out on Wednesday and continue through the end of the week.Snap\u2019s stock has fallen below its initial public offering price, and the company remains unprofitable. Snap delivered a disappointing earnings report this month, causing its stock to plunge even further. .Some things about Snapchat are not changing. For instance, the app still opens to the phone camera, allowing users to make and share photos and videos.But the redesign otherwise moves Snapchat even further away from a traditional social media model.Material shown on the app\u2019s right side \u2014 what is now the media part \u2014 must meet content and community standards, Snap has decided, whether that material is produced by a newspaper, a television studio, the company\u2019s in-house news and stories teams or so-called influencers. All must be vetted and approved.\u201cSeparating social from media has allowed us to build the best way to communicate with friends and the best way to watch great content \u2014 while addressing many of the problems that plague the internet today,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.Philip Napoli, a professor of public policy at Duke who studies media and democracy, said that Snapchat\u2019s redesign would test people\u2019s willingness to embrace a social media app that relied more on human curators than algorithms.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there\u2019s enough of a consumer backlash to make this potentially viable, especially in light of the last year,\u201d Professor Napoli said.Snap said it was using a kind of artificial intelligence known as machine learning to understand what people like to see, based on their activity, and planned to offer them new content in line with those preferences.There are limits to the amount of personalization that Snapchat will provide. In an approach similar to how Netflix widely promotes some television shows and movies, Snap will continue to promote some material \u2014 including breaking news, a new video series or a popular sporting event \u2014 to all of its users.Human curators will also program content to make sure that users\u2019 preferences are not keeping them from seeing a wide array of opinions and ideas, the company said. In addition to winnowing out fake news, this may keep Snapchat from becoming a place that reinforces narrow sets of thinking.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Said to Have Held Talks to Acquire 21st Century Fox Assets", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Walt Disney Company recently held preliminary talks to buy entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the Fox movie and television studio, the FX cable network and a share of Hulu.The talks were first reported by CNBC on Monday and confirmed by two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private information. The two companies are no longer talking, although discussions could restart.Spokeswomen for both companies declined to comment.The talks, however preliminary, say a lot about the rapidly evolving media industry. Big players like Disney are seeking to get bigger as they follow Netflix into the streaming business and square off against technology giants like AT&T, which is in the final stages of acquiring Time Warner. Medium-size players like 21st Century Fox may be realizing \u2014 or accepting \u2014 that gaining the scale they need to compete may be out of reach at this point.Disney shares climbed 2 percent on Monday. Disney is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.Fox shares shot up 10 percent. Fox is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\u201cWe see the real strategy here as Fox content helping Disney build out its direct-to-consumer strategy,\u201d Steven Cahall, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note.As growth in the traditional cable business slows because of cord cutting, Disney also sees value in Hulu, which focuses on programming aimed at adults, including the Emmy-winning \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d Disney owns 30 percent of Hulu now. Fox also holds a 30 percent share, with the balance owned by Comcast and Time Warner.As part of the talks, Disney also looked at buying Fox\u2019s minority stake in Sky, the Britain-based pay-television service. Fox has been trying to buy all of Sky, but has so far been stymied by regulatory approvals.For 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, such a sale would amount to an acknowledgment that it cannot compete against media colossuses like AT&T and Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal. Companies like Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google are also expanding into entertainment.Mr. Murdoch tried to buy Time Warner in 2014 for $89 billion but dropped the effort after Time Warner spurned the offer.With some of its assets sold, Fox would remain a powerful player in television news and sports, two niches that remain highly valued by advertisers. The talks with Disney did not include the sale of Fox\u2019s broadcasting network, Fox News or Fox\u2019s sports holdings.In its last fiscal year, which ended on June 30, 21st Century Fox had $28.5 billion in revenue, a 4 percent increase from a year earlier, and $2.95 billion in profit attributable to Fox shareholders, a 7 percent increase.

{"Headline": "Enriching Academic Vocabulary: Strategies for Teaching Tier Two Words to E.L.L. Students", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYes, the vocabulary in New York Times articles can be challenging, and teachers of English language learners may assume it\u2019s too hard for their students. But Larry Ferlazzo, who writes for us regularly about how he uses The Times in his E.L.L. classroom, has taught with articles on everything from climate change to Valentine\u2019s Day, and he has a few tips to share. What Are Tier Two Words?\u2022 Tier One words are the words of everyday speech usually learned in the early grades, albeit not at the same rate by all children. They are not considered a challenge to the average native speaker, though English language learners of any age will have to attend carefully to them.But Tier Two words, as the authors of the Standards point out, \u201care frequently encountered in complex written texts and are particularly powerful because of their wide applicability to many sorts of reading.\u201dThis is why, when I\u2019m working with English language learners, I mainly focus on this tier. There is simply more bang for your teaching buck: Learning these words will make more texts accessible to your students.Steps For Teaching Academic VocabularyFirst, I pronounce the word, and usually write it on the board or overhead as well. Mr. Marzano doesn\u2019t explicitly point out the act of pronunciation in the six-step process. However, it is a crucial step for E.L.L.s.Then, I describe the word using various examples, sometimes with an image, sometimes using it in different sentences, or, often, both.I try to complete these first three steps on the same day that new vocabulary is introduced._________ Tools to Surface Words and Word PatternsTeachers might try putting the text of a Times article into the tool to quickly surface words to teach. You can use the functions to sort the words alphabetically, by how common or rare they are, and by their appearance on various word lists, including an Academic Word List.One other way to use this tool that might make a fun challenge for students: Create a graphic, like the one in the image above, of the first several paragraphs of an article you\u2019re about to read, and invite students to guess what that article will be about.Teacher-Created Word ChartsA Word Chart is a simple graphic organizer used to pre-teach the key vocabulary words that students will encounter in a text or genre.The teacher identifies 10 or so key words and either provides a copy of a Word Chart graphic organizer with the words already printed or with blank spaces for students to write them.Next, students share with a partner and make any needed revisions. Finally, the entire class reviews those words with the teacher calling on students to share what they wrote and drew. That process is then repeated until all the words are reviewed.This all culminates, of course, in the class reading the text \u2014 everyone together, in pairs, or individually. You may choose to ask students to circle the targeted words as they go.Student-Created Word ChartsStudents can also create their own versions of Word Charts when reading a text and then identify and define words that are new to them.Next, students read the article on their own, completing portions of the chart as they went. They took a break every seven minutes or so to teach their classmates what they learned and share summaries of each paragraph.Afterward, of course, we discussed the message of the article, and what it made them think and feel. Here is how the piece ends \u2014 a paragraph I didn\u2019t modify at all:School\u2019s out for summer now, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about all those brand-new Americans recalling the countries of their birth, using the poetry of their new language to convey the beauty of home. English is a problematic language, but these students are working hard to learn it \u2014 and working harder still to belong.Word WebsI keep our Word Webs simple, and generally use them in preparation for a writing assignment. For instance, I might use a version to help students identify words that fit under the five senses.Student-Created VideosA video made by one of my students as we were learning about writing Problem-Solution essays.Having students create 15-second videos defining words can be another vocabulary-reinforcing activity and a lot of fun.I\u2019ve been doing this activity with my E.L.L. students for years, primarily using Instagram because of its easy \u201cstop action\u201d feature. They accompany their narration with a series of colorful sheets first showing the word then their own definition, followed by a sentence using the word, then a cartoon illustrating the sentence and ending with the word again.Teacher or Student-Created Cloze ExercisesClozes, also known as \u201cfill-in-the-blanks\u201d or \u201cgap-fills,\u201d are relatively short texts with key words removed so students must use context clues. Vocabulary-Learning Strategies Outside the ClassroomWhat can students do when they come across new words and there\u2019s no teacher around to help? My students brainstormed a list, which now both hangs in the front of our class and is in their notebooks.Ask classmates for help.Remember what has helped me in the past.After I\u2019m done, double-check my work.Use Google Translate or a dictionary.Highlight or underline important words in a text.When I don\u2019t understand a word, I can use context clues, do a word analysis (prefix, root, suffix), and think if it\u2019s a cognate (similar to words in other languages).After I\u2019ve finished an activity, take a minute to think about what things I did that helped me.Ask my teachers questions to clarify or confirm my thinking and not just to get the answer. (Does it look like I\u2019m on the right track? I think this word means __________________\u2014is that right?) In-Depth Investigations Into Individual WordsThe Times is just the place to find those words in the wild.What individual words would your students choose to learn more about? What will they discover?_________How do you teach Tier Two vocabulary to your students, whether they are English language learners or not? Tell us in the comments.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the \u2018Resistance\u2019 Helped Democrats Dominate Virginia", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "FeatureFor campaign managers like Kathryn Sorenson, much of their job was simply channeling the enormous wave of energy that came their way.Supported byEven if she hadn\u2019t broken her neck, she most likely couldn\u2019t have taken even a few hours off work to attend the march: She was the manager, and sole employee, of the two-week-old David Reid for Delegate campaign. Sorenson met Reid on New Year\u2019s Day for a mutual interview; Reid, a well-kept, goateed father of two in his mid-50s, was a latecomer to politics, and was relieved when Sorenson agreed to lead his campaign for the House of Delegates, the 100-member lower chamber of Virginia\u2019s legislature. In her six years out of college, Sorenson had worked continuously on campaigns, all but one of them in Northern Virginia, and despite her youth, she exhibited the grim, sardonic cheer of the veteran operative.Sorenson agreed to work with a novice like Reid because he seemed committed to real issues, and he made a sincere first impression. Also, she liked his odds. Virginia\u2019s 32nd house district is part of Loudoun County, one of the fastest growing counties in the country and, by median income, the wealthiest. Verdant, indistinguishable subdivisions are laid out in self-contained loops between windowed blocks of strip mall and windowless blocks of data center. There are overpasses to nowhere; there are construction sites that look like Caterpillar sales lots as well as actual Caterpillar sales lots. The county and its schools are around 30 percent nonwhite, with a large immigrant population. (Sorenson\u2019s favorite local lunch spot is an Afghan kebab joint.) The 32nd went for Hillary Clinton by 19 points. There was, Sorenson quickly got into the habit of saying, \u201cabsolutely no reason this district has a Republican delegate.\u201dThey had come, she realized, on behalf of what she began to call \u201cthe pop-up groups.\u201d She went to as many of their meetings as she could and found that many of their members were largely unacquainted with politics, especially on the local level. Some of them weren\u2019t even county residents; they were from McLean, and Arlington, and D.C., and even Maryland. Though a majority of these meetings might have been better described as meetings about meetings, she nevertheless admired all these new faces and the vitality they were prepared to bring to what were ordinarily considered marginal down-ballot races.What Sorenson needed from these inchoate volunteer armies, however, was not a collective expression of outrage; it was reliable support for campaign practicalities like door-knocking and phone-banking, tasks that lacked the glamour and solidarity of marches and protests. Even those who could readily speak about state and local issues \u2014 how the Republicans in the House of Delegates had refused the Medicaid expansion and passed a sheaf of anti-abortion bills; how Loudoun County was the only district in Northern Virginia without full-day kindergarten; how somebody needed to put a stoplight at Waxpool and Demott, where Sorenson was almost killed \u2014 were rarely acquainted with the proper channels for action. They would talk about calling their representative, and Sorenson would say, \u201cThat\u2019s not a congressional thing, that\u2019s a state thing!\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s not a state thing, that\u2019s a supervisor thing! Call your supervisor!\u201d Sorenson showed them how to find out who their supervisors were. They wanted to write letters to Terry McAuliffe, the governor, about bathroom discrimination. She said: \u201cDon\u2019t write letters to Terry! The bathroom bill is dead, don\u2019t worry. It died in subcommittee, and even if it hadn\u2019t, Terry had already promised to veto it, so pick a better battle!\u201dTo get Reid on the ballot, Sorenson explained, the campaign needed to collect 125 signatures by March. The pop-up groups were happy to help, especially because Sorenson had a pleasant, easygoing appeal, not to mention a broken neck. Within a few weeks, she was given almost 600 names. She couldn\u2019t quite account for how it was done; these groups didn\u2019t have leadership, exactly, or if they did, they had large \u201csteering committees\u201d \u2014 and they could be touchy if you used the wrong word or gave one individual too much credit \u2014 but they used Facebook and they contacted friends of friends and somehow they got the signatures they needed. And not only that. Representatives from some groups got the required signatures, and then representatives from some other groups materialized to vet those signatures and remove inadvertent out-of-district signatories, and then still other representatives from different or maybe the same groups suggested they might help Sorenson by formatting all of that petition data so they could merge the relevant information with their master voter file. As long as Sorenson was explicit about what she needed, it all seemed to just ... happen.A majority of the pop-up groups were experiments in decentralized organizing, so individual chapters were free to expend their energy where and how they pleased. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia \u2014 and in particular to its 32nd district. Reid\u2019s district had no primary, for one thing, and seemed acutely winnable. It also had Sorenson. She was not only competent; she was, at least outwardly, calm. She also reached out to each group on its own terms, even if that effort alone absorbed three or four hours of each day. And she didn\u2019t want to seem exploitative, so she refused on principle to blast the groups\u2019 lists with what she called \u201chair-on-fire send-$5-now-or-the-world-will-end emails.\u201dThough in theory these groups had diverse goals, the impression they made on Sorenson was one of a great, reverberant longing. \u201cThere\u2019s just this huge energy,\u201d Sorenson told me, \u201cwith people saying, \u2018We want to do something right now, we want to effect change in this election.\u2019\u2009\u201d They were hard to keep track of: who was with which group, what each one cared about, which groups were subgroups or affinity groups of other groups, which had national umbrella organizations and which didn\u2019t, which terms of art groups preferred to describe their particular variety of leaderlessness. There were chapters and huddles and pods, and they used Google Forms or Google Docs or Eventbrites or Meetups. She found herself scrolling through endless Facebook commentaries in search of group moderators or other sources of provisional authority.She began to build her own Google Doc as a central storehouse for all the fugitive information. This color-coded document included but was not limited to, in no particular order, the following groups: 31st Street Swing Left; Code Blue; Indivisible Del Ray; Indivisible VA Assembly 42; Network NoVA; NOVANation Coalition; Sister District DC; Sister District Maryland; Swing Left; Together We Will NoVA; Vienna Neighbors United; VOTE MOB VA; WofA (We of Action); ACT Empowered; We ARE the People Who Stand Up; Loudoun 4 Women\u2019s March on Washington; Hunter Mill Huddle; Arlington Huddle Action Network; Neighbors for a Blue Virginia; Ward 3 Democrats; the Resurgent Left; Turn It Blue DC (formerly Swing Left NE DC); Dining for Democracy; #Citizen. Sorenson got a kick out of the names the groups had given themselves. She loved one called the Huddlery.Sorenson\u2019s list included the names of the principals, to which she often felt obligated to append the qualification \u201c(co-leader?)\u201d or \u201c(steering committee member?).\u201d She documented their purpose, insofar as she could divine it; her perception of their viability (\u201call talk no plans\u201d); and their willingness to help the Reid campaign to, as her own hashtag put it, #flip32blue. Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way. Some, like Flippable, had former campaign people on staff; they just needed to hear the numbers and they\u2019d mail a check. Others, like the West L.A. Democratic Club, asked her questions for an hour before saying no. Some had clear purity tests \u2014 \u201cWill you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?\u201d \u201cWere you endorsed by Senator Sanders?\u201d \u2014 and Sorenson\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t always check all the boxes. Others were concerned that she didn\u2019t need the help badly enough.Sorenson did her best to put her candidate and their campaign up for adoption in a way that made their specific requirements clear. It was going to be expensive, for one thing. They had to raise at least $400,000, or $500,000 if she wanted her \u201cCadillac plan.\u201d The map of Loudoun County is a Mandelbrot set of nested subdivisions, and three of her precincts \u2014 the Villas, Lansdowne Woods and the Ashby Ponds retirement community \u2014 are gated and thus \u201cunknockable,\u201d which meant the campaign would have to double down on phone banking. This would require a lot of coordination. Running against a seven-year incumbent, Reid also faced a huge deficit in name recognition, which meant that early preparatory canvassing was just as important as a late turnout effort.Money and time would always be the hardest asks, but while Sorenson was still neck-braced and understaffed, there were plenty of basic start-up tasks to complete. One outfit offered to make the campaign an easily updatable website. Another sent a member to take photographs, which saved the campaign $700. Sorenson offhandedly mentioned that it would be nice to have a spreadsheet itemizing all of Tag Greason\u2019s votes in his seven years in the House of Delegates \u2014 bill number, how he voted, why it matters. She had it within hours. Yet another organization delivered print-at-home postcards that recalled classic Americana, marked with parks and schools and polling places; she wanted people to keep in mind that the 32nd district was an actual place. She loved the postcards, even if she had to send repeated reminders about which disclosures were necessary to make them compliant with campaign-finance law.It wasn\u2019t lost on her that some of the work being done was redundant, and that some of her interactions required more effort than they ultimately returned, but Sorenson understood that the new spirits were fragile. She tried to remind herself that each group brought its own perspective or talent, even as her attempt to outline their special characteristics revealed a litany of special needs. One group was part of a Jewish organization and thus couldn\u2019t canvass on Saturdays. Another one wanted to know how to get over to Loudoun without paying tolls, and many of its members were older and needed printed directions or car pools. But Sorenson\u2019s willingness to keep track of and accommodate all these preferences gave her word-of-mouth fame. No research trial \u2014 volunteer-coordination software, fund-raising by text message \u2014 was too small or bug-ridden for her to disdain, and she joked that she was first in every line to serve as a guinea pig.In June, Shaun Daniels, then an executive director of an influential PAC called Win Virginia, told me, \u201cNo one anywhere is working with more outside groups than Kathryn.\u201d Democratic politics had entered a new era of experimentation, he said, and \u201cthis here is ground zero.\u201dThe other salient election was the recent runoff between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. Sorenson herself was not disposed to draw any big lessons from Ossoff\u2019s defeat, which she was by nature unable to regard as a leading indicator on the president, or the Democratic Party, or the role of outside patrons. It seemed to her that the campaign was waged about as well as it could have been in a district that was close to impossible for a Democrat to win. For many of her volunteers, however, the loss felt like a dispiriting prelude to what was supposed to be a stirring campaign kickoff.Early in the morning, a crowd of campaign staff members, longstanding volunteers and outside irregulars milled around Reid\u2019s home in anticipation of their canvassing shifts. The family\u2019s two shiba inus were underfoot, the coffee table was decorated with back issues of astronomy and archaeology magazines and the whole place smelled faintly but persistently of maple syrup. There were cars from Massachusetts and Missouri, and Reid joked more than once about how he kept meaning to give out an award for the person who traveled the farthest to be there. The volunteers were mostly women, and mostly middle-aged, and had come outfitted for day hikes of moderate exertion. Whenever one of them was asked which group, if any, she had come with, there was a perceptible pause as she thought about the profusion of mailers in her inbox and posts in her Facebook feed.Those there for the first time were nervous about how they would be greeted. A woman from Vienna, Va., named Francesca, in capri-length cargo pants, sturdy boots and a beaded necklace, raised her hand. She had come on behalf of half a dozen groups. \u201cAm I going to look like a carpetbagger, or should I say that I care so much that I came here from elsewhere?\u201dReid looked to Sorenson before responding. \u201cNobody will ask you because you look like the district \u2014 it\u2019s pretty diverse here. We joke that we give an award for the person who came the furthest. All of this, here, it\u2019s really starting to make a difference.\u201d The volunteers were shuffled through a brief orientation, which was longer on Reid\u2019s biography \u2014 a foster child who was the first in his family to go to college; a local businessman who sent his daughters to the public schools; a retired Navy Reserve intelligence officer who gave 23 years of service to his country \u2014 than it was on his positions. But the point of the summer canvass was deliberately introductory.Francesca, the woman from Vienna, cleared a space for me in her cluttered minivan. She\u2019d worked on clean-energy policy, she told me en route, but her entire department was recently eliminated. We passed a new data center across from a data center under construction. She delivered an impassioned monologue as she tried to pay attention to the GPS; she had an air of spiky distraction, as if stopping to scowl at news alerts while watching a TV show. \u201cNow the Klan is out in Charlottesville when they take down the Confederate monuments. Just the other day I went to the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center for the first time in my life. It\u2019s intersectionality. If affluent people like me aren\u2019t caring about Black Lives Matter, well \u2014 it kind of opened my eyes. We can\u2019t ever not be engaged again. It\u2019s like the Founding Fathers\u2019 idea of the yeoman government. My progressive friends, they\u2019re on Facebook but they\u2019re not out canvassing and phone-banking. There\u2019s nothing else going on in \u201917, and there\u2019s all this pent-up energy.\u201dFrancesca said she had gone to the Women\u2019s Summit the previous morning and left exhilarated, but what she took away from the conference wasn\u2019t wholly clear. Each delegate emphasized the importance of gerrymandering, and health care, and school funding, and rural broadband, and the state of the roads. If the national Democratic Party really was in crisis, torn between cultural politics and pocketbook issues, it certainly wasn\u2019t visible at the summit. The biggest applause line of the day came from Danica Roem, a transgender former journalist and \u201cfreshman member of the Democratic Party\u201d who won a surprise victory in a four-way primary in District 13, to the south. \u201cMy opponent,\u201d she said with national-stage charisma, \u201ccares more about where I go to the bathroom than how you get to work!\u201d Francesca, however, seemed to have little interest in low-stakes issues like the office vacancies on Manassas Drive. \u201cWe\u2019re literally fighting for our democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u2019\u2009\u201dWe got out to canvass in a subdivision of modest flagpoled homes on branching cul-de-sacs. Francesca traipsed over people\u2019s lawns and rapped hard on doors. The hit rate with canvassing is always low, and over two hours on a hot and cloudless Sunday, we encountered only half a dozen families at home.In the few conversations Francesca did have, she was invariably friendly and polite, but her pitch about Reid was mostly that he was a great guy; every once in a while she remembered to say that he was in favor of full-day kindergarten districtwide or distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. In her one extended interaction, a young mother began by saying that her family cared above all about full-day kindergarten. She had only ever voted in presidential elections, she admitted, but then managed, over the course of five minutes, to convince herself that she was wrong to do so.\u201cI don\u2019t vote in the local but I guess I really need to now,\u201d she said.\u201cWell, I was never out canvassing before, either!\u201d Francesca said.Some volunteers I accompanied were more careful to stay off lawns, or more fluent in the local issues, or had greater experience with the mechanics of political campaigns; some remembered that a \u201c1\u201d on the voter-information sheet meant most likely to vote for David Reid, while others were sure that great enthusiasm was recorded with a \u201c5.\u201d On the record, they were always positive about their huddles and steering committees, even if off the record they wondered whether the welter of organizations meant duplicative or otherwise-inefficient resource allocation. No one, however, seemed frustrated by the fact that they reached only a handful of voters, or discouraged from making a return trip.By the end of the weekend, more than 40 volunteers had knocked on more than 2,500 doors. Sorenson rarely allowed herself to be thrilled by anything, but she conceded some satisfaction that these were patently terrific results. This wasn\u2019t to say that everything had gone smoothly. When canvassing was over, Sorenson checked the campaign\u2019s email account to find a restrained but irate message from a community member, upset that his home\u2019s \u201cno soliciting\u201d sign was ignored. The volunteer stood and argued about the First Amendment. The voter leaned Republican, he continued, but had always voted on both sides of the aisle, and from what he knew about David Reid, he was interested. This encounter, however, had cost them his vote.This didn\u2019t sound to Sorenson like one of her own people. She looked up the planned itineraries of one of the outside groups \u2014 an organization dedicated to voter-suppression issues \u2014 and found that it must have been someone from its camp. Sorenson wasn\u2019t sure there was much she could do. \u201cThey have a different list, and a different script, and different priorities. We tell our people in training not to get into constitutional battles, but each group does its own thing.\u201dThe major development was an unexpected shift in the dynamics at the top of the ticket. The governor and the state\u2019s two senators were Democrats; the pipe dream for November 2017 was to bring the State Legislature into line. In August, however, the Republican gubernatorial candidate \u2014 a former lobbyist, R.N.C. chairman and all-around establishment figure named Ed Gillespie \u2014 hired an erstwhile Trump campaign operative and reinvented himself in the president\u2019s image. He began to speak out against the removal of Confederate monuments and in favor of the travel ban. He spoke about the danger of \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d even though Virginia has none, and ran campaign ads about Latino gang violence that prompted a rare public rebuke from Obama.It was hard to tell how this affected Sorenson\u2019s race, though the summer poll wasn\u2019t good; Reid was down by seven. But the race, Sorenson knew, was always going to come down to turnout. The weekend after Labor Day would hopefully set the tone for the fall, when, with any luck, the name recognition they\u2019d worked to foster might begin to translate into voter commitments. When returning summer volunteers arrived, they found a more mature operation: there was a sign-in table in the entryway, three times the turnout and a campaign staff large enough for one person to do check in, one person to divide the turf and a third to guide the orientations.Reid as a candidate seemed looser and more confident. He\u2019d received recent endorsements from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, and was willing to talk about more difficult subjects. \u201cThere\u2019s some hesitation among people of color to put up yard signs\u201d for a Democrat, he told a group of volunteers, \u201cafter what we\u2019ve seen, down in Charlottesville and elsewhere, with the emboldening of white supremacists.\u201d He did not seem like the sort of person who\u2019d ever had reason to refer to white supremacy. He was, however, still making the same joke about giving an award to whoever had traveled the farthest to volunteer.For every volunteer who saw fit to challenge the campaign\u2019s authority or its expertise, however, there were half a dozen there for a political education. If everybody hated the tolls, more than one canvasser asked, why were they so high? Well, the campaign answered, the Australian firm that owned the Dulles Greenway had donated $8,000 to Delegate Greason. There was something about the modesty of that figure that got even distant volunteers incensed on behalf of the local community. The conflicts surrounding Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel and the emoluments clause were exasperating but remote in their immensity, whereas a $6 toll for a $2.29 bottle of milk was an affront you could grasp.With 11 days to go before the election, their ground strategy shifted from the voter-commitment stage to the final get-out-the-vote effort; on the campaign\u2019s final Saturday, they enlisted 205 volunteers to go door to door helping voters articulate an explicit plan for when and how they\u2019d go to the polls on Tuesday. The race, as Sorenson predicted, was going to come down to turnout on the margins: their tracking poll had them in a dead heat. Sorenson\u2019s estimate was that Reid needed 13,150 votes to win, and it was easy for her to imagine that the final tallies would be within the 1 percent margin that would trigger an automatic recount. With the race tightening, Greason sent mailers that described Reid as a radical leftist who had taken \u201ctens of thousands of dollars from New York, Washington and California.\u201d Sorenson showed it to me and shrugged. \u201cWell, that last part\u2019s true.\u201dSorenson was grateful for all the money and help from her outside volunteers, but what most moved her was when she felt someone had made the organizational leap from political fury to political identification. When one of her Sister District captains in Maryland asked for a yard sign, Sorenson furrowed her brow and asked her why she wanted one on the other side of the river. The volunteer simply said, \u201cWe need to expand what we think of as our own backyard.\u201d Sorenson didn\u2019t have a lot of time for mawkishness, but that idea, she said, \u201cis just beautiful to me.\u201d And she could appreciate whatever it was that got people newly involved in politics and kept them there. If Indivisible wanted to call Virginia \u201cthe first statewide referendum on Trump,\u201d that was fine with her, as long as they didn\u2019t set expectations so high that their support couldn\u2019t survive a disappointment.The foot traffic \u2014 not just the usual folks from D.C. or Maryland, but people who came from California, Florida and Iowa \u2014 was so steady that the campaign began to run out of clipboards. Volunteers would arrive, muddy and soaked, peel off their clear ponchos and hand over their unreadably macerated voter rolls. By midafternoon, they were almost finished with the fifth complete pass they\u2019d done, over their 11-day \u201cmobilization window,\u201d of all 10,000 doors in their universe. Most returnees declared that everyone on their lists had either voted already or was just waiting for a spouse to come watch the kids; some of them stopped Sorenson to tell her stories about how they took a moment at the end of their shifts to circle back around and check on these promissory replies, and more often than not they encountered \u201cI voted\u201d stickers. Then they\u2019d be handed a new packet and sent back out into the rain. Someone in need of reprieve asked Sorenson when she planned to wrap things up for the day. \u201cWhen do you stop? If your nearest polling place closes at 7:00 and is two minutes away, you stop at 6:58.\u201dSorenson didn\u2019t feel she could really trust the numbers that were coming in \u2014 turnout, she thought, couldn\u2019t realistically be as high as it seemed to be \u2014 but by 4 o\u2019clock she could no longer ignore the fact that most polling places had already far exceeded the totals they usually showed in off years. She dealt with her mounting anxiety by making new spreadsheets to compare precinct-level historical data and devoted her last hour of her campaign\u2019s last day to one final round of phone-banking to voters in what she worried was her one underperforming precinct.The campaign party was at a favorite strip-mall wine bar. Sorenson went home to change, thinking she might have a moment to herself before the results came in, but by the time she and the rest of her team arrived, 90 percent of Loudoun\u2019s precincts were reporting. Reid\u2019s race was one of the first calls. He won with more than 17,000 votes, by at least 17 points. Shoals of well-wishers formed around Sorenson, touching her arms and shoulders and yelling through their tears. \u201cYou are so [expletive] awesome,\u201c one said. \u201cYou brought happiness back into our lives,\u201d said another.Sorenson made her way through the crowd slowly and with only a small, hesitant, curious smile. Every few minutes the growing crowd reacted to new results. Wins at the top of the ticket brought sighs of relief, but the shouted announcement of each successive delegate victory triggered gasps and whoops of astonishment: the first Asian-American woman, the first two Latina women, the first out lesbian, the first trans woman, an African-American woman, even a woman in a Trump district; altogether at least 11 new Democratic women, seven from Northern Virginia alone, in a swell that seemed likely to result in 16 flipped districts for a tied House. Eventually Sorenson sat down with her finance and field directors \u2014 the three young women, Reid later proclaimed, who organized a legion of volunteers and brought them to victory \u2014 to eat some cheese; she particularly liked the kind of Brie they had there, which is why they chose the venue for the party. She stopped to read a congratulatory text from \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s guy.\u201dHer finance director looked over at her and asked, through a flood of tears: \u201cHow are you so calm? I feel like we\u2019ve all been in our little bubble, but look\u201d \u2014 she gestured toward the television overhead \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re on MSNBC! How are you not crying?\u201dSorenson just smiled her smile of mellow detachment, and finally spoke. \u201cI just kind of want to throw my phone into the ocean.\u201dGideon Lewis-Kraus is a writer at large for the magazine.

{"Headline": "YouTube\u2019s Rapid Response Partisans Game the News of Tragedy", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftRoughly an hour later, Mr. Williams, 51, a popular right-wing YouTube personality who calls himself \u201cThe Doctor of Common Sense,\u201d had filmed, edited and uploaded a three-minute monologue about the Sutherland Springs church shooting to his YouTube page, which had roughly 90,000 subscribers. Authorities had not yet named a suspect, but that didn\u2019t deter Mr. Williams, who is black, from speculating that the gunman was probably \u201ceither a Muslim or black.\u201dLater, after the shooter was identified as a white man named Devin P. Kelley, Mr. Williams posted a follow-up video. He claimed that Mr. Kelley was most likely a Bernie Sanders supporter associated with antifa \u2014 a left-wing anti-fascist group \u2014 who may have converted to Islam. Despite having no evidence for those claims, Mr. Williams argued them passionately, saying that photos of Mr. Kelley circulating online suggested that he was a violent liberal.\u201cSometimes, you can tell a lot from a person\u2019s picture,\u201d Mr. Williams said.YouTube has long been a haven for slapdash political punditry, but in recent months, a certain type of hyper-prolific conspiracist has emerged as a dominant force. By reacting quickly and voluminously to breaking news, these rapid-response pundits \u2014 the YouTube equivalent of talk radio shock jocks \u2014 have successfully climbed the site\u2019s search results, and exposed legions of viewers to their far-fetched theories.In a phone interview from his home in Houston, Mr. Williams told me that he had created more than 10,000 YouTube videos over an eight-year period, posting as many as 20 monologues per day, and racking up an estimated 200 million views.His hit productions have included fact-challenged videos like \u201cBarack and Michelle Obama Both Come Out The Closet,\u201d which garnered 1.6 million views, and \u201cHillary Clinton Is On Crack Cocaine,\u201d which had 665,000. He was admitted to YouTube\u2019s partner program, which allows popular posters to earn money by displaying ads on certain types of videos, and claims to have made as much as $10,000 a month from his channel.\u201cI like to call myself a reporter who reports the news for the common person,\u201d Mr. Williams said.Whether motivated by profit or micro-celebrity, the success of sensationalists like Mr. Williams has become a vexing problem for companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, which owns YouTube.These companies sort and prioritize information for their users, and most have built ranking systems that boost news from mainstream outlets over stories from less credible sources. But those algorithms can be gamed in breaking news situations by users who work fast, uploading their videos in the valuable minutes between when news breaks and when the first wave of legitimate articles and videos appears.\u201cBefore reliable sources put up stories, it\u2019s a bit of a free-for-all,\u201d said Karen North, a professor studying social media at the University of Southern California. \u201cPeople who are in the business of posting sensationalized opinions about the news have learned that the sooner they put up their materials, the more likely their content will be found by an audience.\u201dConservatives have argued that YouTube unfairly targets their videos while allowing liberal channels, such as The Young Turks, to post heated political commentary. And some dispute that there is any conscious gaming going on.Tech companies, already under fire for the ease with which they allowed Russia to interfere in last year\u2019s election, have also vowed to take a harder stance on domestic misinformation. Twitter\u2019s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, told congressional investigators last week that the company would take steps to keep false stories from being featured on trending topic pages.\u201cIt\u2019s a bad user experience, and we don\u2019t want to be known as a platform for that,\u201d Mr. Edgett said.In Mr. Williams\u2019s case, human intervention seems to have been necessary. On Tuesday, shortly after I asked YouTube some questions about Mr. Williams\u2019s account, all of his videos disappeared, and his profile was replaced by a message saying, \u201cThis account has been terminated due to multiple or severe violations of YouTube\u2019s policy prohibiting hate speech.\u201dMr. Williams, who said he had recently left his job as an operations manager at a hazardous materials plant to focus on full-time punditry, has tangled with YouTube\u2019s hate speech policies before. The company shut down one of his previous accounts for similar infractions, which he claimed cost him 250,000 subscribers and a lucrative income stream.\u201cIf YouTube didn\u2019t punish me,\u201d Mr. Williams said, \u201cI could easily be making over $30,000 a month.\u201dIn a statement, YouTube said that Mr. Williams\u2019s account was banned \u201cas soon as it was flagged to us,\u201d because its terms of service prohibit repeat rule-breakers from opening new accounts. It also said that its terms prohibit advertising from appearing on videos featuring \u201ccontroversial and sensitive events, tragedies, political conflicts, and other sensitive topics.\u201dEven before this week\u2019s crackdown, Mr. Williams was branching out. He sells cellphone ringtones on his website, and was considering starting his own paid streaming service. Tuesday night, just hours after he was banned by YouTube, Mr. Williams posted a video on Vimeo, another video-hosting platform. He pledged to keep insulting his favorite targets \u2014 Democrats, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama \u2014 and not shy away from controversy, no matter what the policies said.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be on YouTube anymore,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s too communist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can A.I. Be Taught to Explain Itself?", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "FeatureAs machine learning becomes more powerful, the field\u2019s researchers increasingly find themselves unable to account for what their algorithms know \u2014 or how they know it.Supported byKosinski has made a career of warning others about the uses and potential abuses of data. Four years ago, he was pursuing a Ph.D. in psychology, hoping to create better tests for signature personality traits like introversion or openness to change. But he and a collaborator soon realized that Facebook might render personality tests superfluous: Instead of asking if someone liked poetry, you could just see if they \u201cliked\u201d Poetry Magazine. In 2014, they published a study showing that if given 200 of a user\u2019s likes, they could predict that person\u2019s personality-test answers better than their own romantic partner could.After getting his Ph.D., Kosinski landed a teaching position at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and soon started looking for new data sets to investigate. One in particular stood out: faces. For decades, psychologists have been leery about associating personality traits with physical characteristics, because of the lasting taint of phrenology and eugenics; studying faces this way was, in essence, a taboo. But to understand what that taboo might reveal when questioned, Kosinski knew he couldn\u2019t rely on a human judgment.Kosinski first mined 200,000 publicly posted dating profiles, complete with pictures and information ranging from personality to political views. Then he poured that data into an open-source facial-recognition algorithm \u2014 a so-called deep neural network, built by researchers at Oxford University \u2014 and asked it to find correlations between people\u2019s faces and the information in their profiles. The algorithm failed to turn up much, until, on a lark, Kosinski turned its attention to sexual orientation. The results almost defied belief. In previous research, the best any human had done at guessing sexual orientation from a profile picture was about 60 percent \u2014 slightly better than a coin flip. Given five pictures of a man, the deep neural net could predict his sexuality with as much as 91 percent accuracy. For women, that figure was lower but still remarkable: 83 percent.It was Kosinski\u2019s own research, but when he tried to answer that question, he was reduced to a painstaking hunt for clues. At first, he tried covering up or exaggerating parts of faces, trying to see how those changes would affect the machine\u2019s predictions. Results were inconclusive. But Kosinski knew that women, in general, have bigger foreheads, thinner jaws and longer noses than men. So he had the computer spit out the 100 faces it deemed most likely to be gay or straight and averaged the proportions of each. It turned out that the faces of gay men exhibited slightly more \u201cfeminine\u201d proportions, on average, and that the converse was true for women. If this was accurate, it could support the idea that testosterone levels \u2014 already known to mold facial features \u2014 help mold sexuality as well.But it was impossible to say for sure. Other evidence seemed to suggest that the algorithms might also be picking up on culturally driven traits, like straight men wearing baseball hats more often. Or \u2014 crucially \u2014 they could have been picking up on elements of the photos that humans don\u2019t even recognize. \u201cHumans might have trouble detecting these tiny footprints that border on the infinitesimal,\u201d Kosinski says. \u201cComputers can do that very easily.\u201dIt has become commonplace to hear that machines, armed with machine learning, can outperform humans at decidedly human tasks, from playing Go to playing \u201cJeopardy!\u201d We assume that is because computers simply have more data-crunching power than our soggy three-pound brains. Kosinski\u2019s results suggested something stranger: that artificial intelligences often excel by developing whole new ways of seeing, or even thinking, that are inscrutable to us. It\u2019s a more profound version of what\u2019s often called the \u201cblack box\u201d problem \u2014 the inability to discern exactly what machines are doing when they\u2019re teaching themselves novel skills \u2014 and it has become a central concern in artificial-intelligence research. In many arenas, A.I. methods have advanced with startling speed; deep neural networks can now detect certain kinds of cancer as accurately as a human. But human doctors still have to make the decisions \u2014 and they won\u2019t trust an A.I. unless it can explain itself.This isn\u2019t merely a theoretical concern. In 2018, the European Union will begin enforcing a law requiring that any decision made by a machine be readily explainable, on penalty of fines that could cost companies like Google and Facebook billions of dollars. The law was written to be powerful and broad and fails to define what constitutes a satisfying explanation or how exactly those explanations are to be reached. It represents a rare case in which a law has managed to leap into a future that academics and tech companies are just beginning to devote concentrated effort to understanding. As researchers at Oxford dryly noted, the law \u201ccould require a complete overhaul of standard and widely used algorithmic techniques\u201d \u2014 techniques already permeating our everyday lives.Those techniques can seem inescapably alien to our own ways of thinking. Instead of certainty and cause, A.I. works off probability and correlation. And yet A.I. must nonetheless conform to the society we\u2019ve built \u2014 one in which decisions require explanations, whether in a court of law, in the way a business is run or in the advice our doctors give us. The disconnect between how we make decisions and how machines make them, and the fact that machines are making more and more decisions for us, has birthed a new push for transparency and a field of research called explainable A.I., or X.A.I. Its goal is to make machines able to account for the things they learn, in ways that we can understand. But that goal, of course, raises the fundamental question of whether the world a machine sees can be made to match our own.Machine learning isn\u2019t just one technique. It encompasses entire families of them, from \u201cboosted decision trees,\u201d which allow an algorithm to change the weighting it gives to each data point, to \u201crandom forests,\u201d which average together many thousands of randomly generated decision trees. The sheer proliferation of different techniques, none of them obviously better than the others, can leave researchers flummoxed over which one to choose. Many of the most powerful are bafflingly opaque; others evade understanding because they involve an avalanche of statistical probability. It can be almost impossible to peek inside the box and see what, exactly, is happening.Rich Caruana, an academic who works at Microsoft Research, has spent almost his entire career in the shadow of this problem. When he was earning his Ph.D at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1990s, his thesis adviser asked him and a group of others to train a neural net \u2014 a forerunner of the deep neural net \u2014 to help evaluate risks for patients with pneumonia. Between 10 and 11 percent of cases would be fatal; others would be less urgent, with some percentage of patients recovering just fine without a great deal of medical attention. The problem was figuring out which cases were which \u2014 a high-stakes question in, say, an emergency room, where doctors have to make quick decisions about what kind of care to offer. Of all the machine-learning techniques students applied to this question, Caruana\u2019s neural net was the most effective. But when someone on the staff of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center asked him if they should start using his algorithm, \u201cI said no,\u201d Caruana recalls. \u201cI said we don\u2019t understand what it does inside. I said I was afraid.\u201dThe problem was in the algorithm\u2019s design. Classical neural nets focus only on whether the prediction they gave is right or wrong, tweaking and weighing and recombining all available morsels of data into a tangled web of inferences that seems to get the job done. But some of these inferences could be terrifically wrong. Caruana was particularly concerned by something another graduate student noticed about the data they were handling: It seemed to show that asthmatics with pneumonia fared better than the typical patient. This correlation was real, but the data masked its true cause. Asthmatic patients who contract pneumonia are immediately flagged as dangerous cases; if they tended to fare better, it was because they got the best care the hospital could offer. A dumb algorithm, looking at this data, would have simply assumed asthma meant a patient was likely to get better \u2014 and thus concluded that they were in less need of urgent care.\u201cI knew I could probably fix the program for asthmatics,\u201d Caruana says. \u201cBut what else did the neural net learn that was equally wrong? It couldn\u2019t warn me about the unknown unknowns. That tension has bothered me since the 1990s.\u201dThe story of asthmatics with pneumonia eventually became a legendary allegory in the machine-learning community. Today, Caruana is one of perhaps a few dozen researchers in the United States dedicated to finding more transparent new approaches to machine learning. For the last six years, he has been creating a new model that combines a number of machine-learning techniques. The result is as accurate as his original neural network, and it can spit out charts that show how each individual variable \u2014 from asthma to age \u2014 is predictive of mortality risk, making it easier to see which ones exhibit particularly unusual behavior. Immediately, asthmatics are revealed as a far outlier. Other strange truths surface, too: For example, risk for people age 100 goes down suddenly. \u201cIf you made it to this round number of 100,\u201d Caruana says, \u201cit seemed as if the doctors were saying, \u2018Let\u2019s try to get you another year,\u2019 which might not happen if you\u2019re 93.\u201dCaruana may have brought clarity to his own project, but his solution only underscored the fact the explainability is a kaleidoscopic problem. The explanation a doctor needs from a machine isn\u2019t the same as the one a fighter pilot might need or the one an N.S.A. analyst sniffing out a financial fraud might need. Different details will matter, and different technical means will be needed for finding them. You couldn\u2019t, for example, simply use Caruana\u2019s techniques on facial data, because they don\u2019t apply to image recognition. There may, in other words, eventually have to be as many approaches to explainability as there are approaches to machine learning itself.The researchers in Gunning\u2019s group stepped confidently up to the white board, showing off new, more powerful ways to draw predictions from a machine and then visualize them. But the intelligence analyst evaluating their pitches, a woman who couldn\u2019t tell anyone in the room what she did or what tools she was using, waved it all away. Gunning remembers her as plainly dressed, middle-aged, typical of the countless government agents he had known who toiled thanklessly in critical jobs. \u201cNone of this solves my problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be able to visualize another recommendation. If I\u2019m going to sign off on a decision, I need to be able to justify it.\u201d She was issuing what amounted to a broadside. It wasn\u2019t just that a clever graph indicating the best choice wasn\u2019t the same as explaining why that choice was correct. The analyst was pointing to a legal and ethical motivation for explainability: Even if a machine made perfect decisions, a human would still have to take responsibility for them \u2014 and if the machine\u2019s rationale was beyond reckoning, that could never happen.Gunning, a grandfatherly military man whose buzz cut has survived his stints as a civilian, is a program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. He works in Darpa\u2019s shiny new midrise tower in downtown Alexandria, Va. \u2014 an office indistinguishable from the others nearby, except that the security guard out front will take away your cellphone and warn you that turning on the Wi-Fi on your laptop will make security personnel materialize within 30 seconds. Darpa managers like Gunning don\u2019t have permanent jobs; the expectation is that they serve four-year \u201ctours,\u201d dedicated to funding cutting-edge research along a single line of inquiry. When he found himself at the brainstorming session, Gunning had recently completed his second tour as a sort of Johnny Appleseed for A.I.: Starting in the 1990s, he has founded hundreds of projects, from the first application of machine-learning techniques to the internet, which presaged the first search engines, to the project that eventually spun off as Siri, Apple\u2019s voice-controlled assistant. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a dinosaur,\u201d he says with a smile.As of now, most of the military\u2019s practical applications of such technology involve performing enormous calculations beyond the reach of human patience, like predicting how to route supplies. But there are more ambitious applications on the horizon. One recent research program tried to use machine learning to sift through millions of video clips and internet messages in Yemen to detect cease-fire violations; if the machine does find something, it has to be able to describe what\u2019s worth paying attention to. Another pressing need is for drones flying on self-directed missions to be able to explain their limitations so that the humans commanding the drones know what the machines can \u2014 and cannot \u2014 be asked to do. Explainability has thus become a hurdle for a wealth of possible projects, and the Department of Defense has begun to turn its eye to the problem.After that brainstorming session, Gunning took the analyst\u2019s story back to Darpa and soon signed up for his third tour. As he flew across the country meeting with computer scientists to help design an overall strategy for tackling the problem of X.A.I., what became clear was that the field needed to collaborate more broadly and tackle grander problems. Computer science, having leapt beyond the bounds of considering purely technical problems, had to look further afield \u2014 to experts, like cognitive scientists, who study the ways humans and machines interact.This represents a full circle for Gunning, who began his career as a cognitive psychologist working on how to design better automated systems for fighter pilots. Later, he began working on what\u2019s now called \u201cold-fashioned A.I.\u201d \u2014 so-called expert systems in which machines were given voluminous lists of rules, then tasked with drawing conclusions by recombining those rules. None of those efforts was particularly successful, because it was impossible to give the computer a set of rules long enough, or flexible enough, to approximate the power of human reasoning. A.I.\u2019s current blossoming came only when researchers began inventing new techniques for letting machines find their own patterns in the data.Gunning\u2019s X.A.I. initiative, which kicked off this year, provides $75 million in funding to 12 new research programs; by the power of the purse strings, Gunning has refocused the energies of a significant part of the American A.I. research community. His hope is that by making these new A.I. methods accountable to the demands of human psychology, they will become both more useful and more powerful. \u201cThe real secret is finding a way to put labels on the concepts inside a deep neural net,\u201d he says. If the concepts inside can be labeled, then they can be used for reasoning \u2014 just like those expert systems were supposed to do in A.I.\u2019s first wave.To create a neural net that can reveal its inner workings, the researchers in Gunning\u2019s portfolio are pursuing a number of different paths. Some of these are technically ingenious \u2014 for example, designing new kinds of deep neural networks made up of smaller, more easily understood modules, which can fit together like Legos to accomplish complex tasks. Others involve psychological insight: One team at Rutgers is designing a deep neural network that, once it makes a decision, can then sift through its data set to find the example that best demonstrates why it made that decision. (The idea is partly inspired by psychological studies of real-life experts like firefighters, who don\u2019t clock in for a shift thinking, These are the 12 rules for fighting fires; when they see a fire before them, they compare it with ones they\u2019ve seen before and act accordingly.) Perhaps the most ambitious of the dozen different projects are those that seek to bolt new explanatory capabilities onto existing deep neural networks. Imagine giving your pet dog the power of speech, so that it might finally explain what\u2019s so interesting about squirrels. Or, as Trevor Darrell, a lead investigator on one of those teams, sums it up, \u201cThe solution to explainable A.I. is more A.I.\u201dFive years ago, Darrell and some colleagues had a novel idea for letting an A.I. teach itself how to describe the contents of a picture. First, they created two deep neural networks: one dedicated to image recognition and another to translating languages. Then they lashed these two together and fed them thousands of images that had captions attached to them. As the first network learned to recognize the objects in a picture, the second simply watched what was happening in the first, then learned to associate certain words with the activity it saw. Working together, the two networks could identify the features of each picture, then label them. Soon after, Darrell was presenting some different work to a group of computer scientists when someone in the audience raised a hand, complaining that the techniques he was describing would never be explainable. Darrell, without a second thought, said, Sure \u2014 but you could make it explainable by once again lashing two deep neural networks together, one to do the task and one to describe it.Darrell\u2019s previous work had piggybacked on pictures that were already captioned. What he was now proposing was creating a new data set and using it in a novel way. Let\u2019s say you had thousands of videos of baseball highlights. An image-recognition network could be trained to spot the players, the ball and everything happening on the field, but it wouldn\u2019t have the words to label what they were. But you might then create a new data set, in which volunteers had written sentences describing the contents of every video. Once combined, the two networks should then be able to answer queries like \u201cShow me all the double plays involving the Boston Red Sox\u201d \u2014 and could potentially show you what cues, like the logos on uniforms, it used to figure out who the Boston Red Sox are.Call it the Hamlet strategy: lending a deep neural network the power of internal monologue, so that it can narrate what\u2019s going on inside. But do the concepts that a network has taught itself align with the reality that humans are describing, when, for example, narrating a baseball highlight? Is the network recognizing the Boston Red Sox by their logo or by some other obscure signal, like \u201cmedian facial-hair distribution,\u201d that just happens to correlate with the Red Sox? Does it actually have the concept of \u201cBoston Red Sox\u201d or just some other strange thing that only the computer understands? It\u2019s an ontological question: Is the deep neural network really seeing a world that corresponds to our own?We human beings seem to be obsessed with black boxes: The highest compliment we give to technology is that it feels like magic. When the workings of a new technology is too obvious, too easy to explain, it can feel banal and uninteresting. But when I asked David Jensen \u2014 a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and one of the researchers being funded by Gunning \u2014 why X.A.I. had suddenly become a compelling topic for research, he sounded almost soulful: \u201cWe want people to make informed decisions about whether to trust autonomous systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019re depriving people of the ability to be fully independent human beings.\u201dFor many, this law seems frustratingly vague. Some legal scholars argue that it might be toothless in practice. Others claim that it will require the basic workings of Facebook and Google to change, lest they face penalties of 4 percent of their revenue. It remains to be seen whether complying with the law will mean a heap of fine print and an extra check box buried in a pop-up window, some new kind of warning-label system marking every machine-made decision or much more profound changes.If Google is one of the companies most endangered by this new scrutiny on A.I., it\u2019s also the company with the greatest wherewithal to lead the whole industry in solving the problem. Even among the company\u2019s astonishing roster of A.I. talent, one particular star is Chris Olah, who holds the title of research scientist \u2014 a title shared by Google\u2019s many ex-professors and Ph.D.s \u2014 without ever having completed more than a year of college. Olah has been working for the last couple of years on creating new ways to visualize the inner workings of a deep neural network. You might recall when Google created a hallucinatory tool called Deep Dream, which produced psychedelic distortions when you fed it an image and which went viral when people used it to create hallucinatory mash-ups like a doll covered in a pattern of doll eyes and a portrait of Vincent Van Gogh made up in places of bird beaks. Olah was one of many Google researchers on the team, led by Alex Mordvintsev, that worked on Deep Dream. It may have seemed like a folly, but it was actually a technical steppingstone.Olah speaks faster and faster as he sinks into an idea, and the words tumbled out of him almost too quickly to follow as he explained what he found so exciting about the work he was doing. \u201cThe truth is, it\u2019s really beautiful. There\u2019s some sense in which we don\u2019t know what it means to see. We don\u2019t understand how humans do it,\u201d he told me, hands gesturing furiously. \u201cWe want to understand something not just about neural nets but something deeper about reality.\u201d Olah\u2019s hope is that deep neural networks reflect something deeper about parsing data \u2014 that insights gleaned from them might in turn shed light on how our brains work.Watching him use the tool, I realized that it was exactly what the psychologist Michal Kosinski needed \u2014 a key to unlock what his deep neural network was seeing when it categorized profile pictures as gay or straight. Kosinski\u2019s most optimistic view of his research was that it represented a new kind of science in which machines could access truths that lay beyond human intuition. The problem was reducing what a computer knew into a single conclusion that a human could grasp and consider. He had painstakingly tested his data set by hand and found evidence that the computer might be discovering hormonal signals in facial structure. That evidence was still fragmentary. But with the tool that Olah showed me, or one like it, Kosinski might have been able to pull back the curtain on how his mysterious A.I. was working. It would be as obvious and intuitive as a picture the computer had drawn on its own.Cliff Kuang is a writer at large for Fast Company and the author of \u201cUser Friendly,\u201d which will be published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Strikes Deal With Volvo to Bring Self-Driving Cars to Its Network", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 No one knows what the future of self-driving cars will look like, or how long it will take to get there. But every major player in the field is striking partnerships to be ready for the day when autonomous vehicles finally become mainstream.That includes Uber, which on Monday announced a new deal with Volvo. Under the agreement, Uber plans to purchase as many as 24,000 self-driving Volvos once the technology is production-ready, putting the vehicles into its extensive ride-hailing network.\u201cEverything we\u2019re doing right now is about building autonomous vehicles at scale,\u201d Jeff Miller, Uber\u2019s head of automotive alliances, said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly how an autonomous world will look. But we know that we want to be the platform that\u2019s at the center of it, from a ride-sharing standpoint.\u201dThe deal is an extension of an agreement Uber made with Volvo nearly two years ago, when the ride-hailing company started its research and development efforts in autonomous vehicles in earnest. Uber has worked with third-party component manufacturers to build software and hardware for driverless cars, then worked closely with Volvo to outfit the automaker\u2019s XC90 vehicles with the technology.But the new deal vastly increases the number of Volvo driverless cars that Uber can work with, showing the scope of its ambitions.\u201cThe only way we could control our own destiny was to work with this technology that had the potential to disrupt our business, and have direct involvement in the creation of it,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford to be on the outside looking in. We have to be in the game.\u201dMr. Miller said that Uber would own and operate fleets of its own vehicles purchased from partners like Volvo, but that there was no one-size-fits-all approach, so it would also allow other self-driving vehicles on its network.An earlier version of this article misstated the type of vehicle Tesla recently unveiled. It was an electric semi-truck that is nearly self-driving, it is not fully autonomous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Cars Cooperate", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "Someday cars will drive themselves and coordinate with one another and smart cities and roadways to eliminate traffic jams and accidents \u2014 including the fatal one that happens in the United States every 15 minutes \u2014 while reducing fuel consumption and effectively giving back to Americans an annual per-capita average of 335 hours in which, for better or worse, they can use their hands and eyeballs in other ways. When and in what shape this utopian future will arrive, though, remains a persistent mystery. What is certain is that those who play the largest roles in solving it will be in a position to dictate \u2014 as those who control infrastructure always have been \u2014 which people and places they will empower and which they will upend.An intelligent automated future, however, depends on the maturation of two entirely separate sets of technologies. The first \u2014 and the one that has drawn most of the investment and media attention in the last five years \u2014 will allow vehicles to drive themselves without any input from their surroundings. The other set of technologies will connect vehicles to their surroundings and to one another, in order to optimize the functioning of the vehicular ecosystem as a whole. Ultimately, these two types of systems will have to complement each other, yet neither can be implemented all at once. In the meantime, the process of developing and deploying them often puts them at odds. Indeed, the two systems are, in a sense, philosophically opposed: libertarian self-reliance in a race with socialist collectivity to be the first to improve traffic flow.In Silicon Valley and elsewhere, where numerous start-ups are competing with software giants like Google and Uber in the \u201cself-driving\u201d category, Peloton has left high-level automation out of its immediate business plan. Rather, it has staked its early success \u2014 and the money of investors like UPS, Volvo and Intel \u2014 on a cooperative technology known as \u201cvehicle-to-vehicle communication,\u201d or V2V, which makes use of a shortwave portion of the radio spectrum that the Federal Communications Commission set aside in 1999 primarily for traffic-safety messaging. A signal can zip through this bandwidth thousands of times faster than the second or two it might typically take a driver to react. This valuable swath of ether (worth billions to the telecommunications industry, which is currently lobbying the F.C.C. to \u201cshare\u201d it) facilitates unlimited potential applications, not just for sending data among vehicles but also for syncing them with traffic lights and other features of the environment. Currently, vehicles using it \u2014 the vast majority belonging to research pilot projects \u2014 broadcast encrypted information 10 times per second to any receivers within 1,000 feet that can decode it. This means that, unlike vehicles that are automated but not connected, they can \u201csee\u201d beyond their actual field of view: an accident just over the crest of a hill, an oncoming car around the corner. \u201cIt will save lives, and everybody knows that,\u201d says Harry Lightsey, the executive director for emerging-technologies policy at General Motors, maker of the 2017 Cadillac CTS, the first commercially available car in the United States to carry the technology. \u201cA delay in rolling out V2V will cost lives, and that\u2019s a tragedy.\u201dPeloton believes that trucking companies are the natural place to start: They can outfit entire fleets at once and reap significant benefits from small improvements. Moreover, most of the 279 billion annual miles trucks travel are on highways, which are far more predictable than city streets and therefore an easier environment in which to usher in new driving features. Thus, the trucking industry is poised to be among the first to adopt both V2V and automated technologies on a grand scale, possibly becoming the arena in which they will compete with each other most ferociously for initial relevance and public acceptance.On the day I met Mercer, he and Jake Gregory, a veteran F.B.I. agent who drove trucks in college and directed safety operations for a small fleet after leaving the bureau, were demonstrating Peloton\u2019s first V2V application, called \u201cplatooning,\u201d in a pair of 18-wheelers. (\u201cPeloton,\u201d the French word for \u201cplatoon,\u201d also designates the main pack of cyclists in a road race.) They eased out onto I-280 with Mercer in the lead. I rode with Gregory, whose cab had been retrofitted with theater-style seats where a bunk bed used to be. These were occupied by Steve Boyd, a Peloton founder, who oversees external affairs; Oliver Bayley, the head of user experience design; and Rod McLane, the company\u2019s marketing manager.Gregory flipped a switch on the dash, and a screen \u2014 mounted where a car\u2019s rearview mirror usually is \u2014 blinked on. \u201cPlatooning not authorized in this area,\u201d it said. The system, Gregory said, was calculating the weight of Mercer\u2019s truck ahead: \u201cIt takes a few minutes for it to establish mass.\u201d The software also used a cellular signal to check with a cloud-based server run by Peloton engineers to see if Gregory was in an appropriate location: a divided highway accessible by only on-off ramps, more easily negotiated than crossings.The system chimed, and the message changed: \u201cReady to platoon.\u201d Gregory pressed a button that allowed Mercer\u2019s truck to take control of his throttle and braking systems over the V2V bandwidth. It began to reel Gregory\u2019s truck in until they were exactly 66 feet apart. By maintaining that gap, it created a slipstream that reduced carbon emissions and saved fuel by an average of 7 percent: 10 percent for the follower and 5 percent for the leader. (A team led by researchers at Purdue University, with a grant from the United States Department of Energy, believes it can help Peloton increase the average to 20 percent, which the team estimates would be worth up to $20 billion a year to the trucking industry.)While continuing to steer, Gregory removed both feet from the pedals and planted them on the floorboard. Mercer slowed at an exit ramp, and Gregory\u2019s truck automatically did, too, beeping at him to resume control. When I first heard about platooning, I imagined it would feel more death-defying, but though the size of the gap had initially unsettled Mercer and Gregory, it attracted little notice on the highway; oblivious passenger-car drivers frequently cut in, dissolving the platoon. In practice, the exercise felt more like an elaborate cruise-control upgrade than the opening bell in a transportation revolution. Bayley agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing!\u201dCritics of V2V, especially those who are solely invested in full automation, dismiss platooning as mere high-speed tailgating. The major added safety benefits, they point out, come from the fact that, in order to platoon, trucks must be equipped with advanced safety features. Peloton readily agrees that its application, whose requirements include air disc brakes and state-of-the-art collision-avoidance, is an incentive for fleets to upgrade. V2V proponents, on the other hand, hope to leverage renewed federal interest in their systems to expand projects that have been gestating for decades. The Department of Transportation, under the outgoing Obama administration, proposed requiring that all new passenger vehicles be equipped with V2V \u2014 at least symbolically moving toward the realization of those goals. Earlier this month, however, reports suggested that the Trump administration might be inclined to shelve the proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s important to get our government leaders to commit to this,\u201d says Larry Head, an engineering professor at the University of Arizona, who is collaborating on V2I applications with Peloton. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait five years. We\u2019re ready now.\u201dAs a society, we routinely make comparable decisions: when we let football players give one another brain damage in the interests of public entertainment; when a surgeon refrains from killing one terminal patient and transplanting his organs into five patients whom they might save. The trolley problem heightens individual culpability by bestowing absolute decision-making power on one person and demanding that she select not between actions but consequences, which in real life are rarely inevitable. Arguably, in doing so, the dilemma tends to reveal our natural inclination to accept fate over premeditation in situations with no happy outcomes, even if planning might partly mitigate an otherwise inevitable tragedy.In recent years, the trolley problem has frequently been adapted to discussions about entirely automated cars, which respond to contingencies with binary logic. Suppose a distracted mother pushes a stroller with her baby in it out in front of such a vehicle \u2014 should the car be programmed to hit them or swerve into a tree? Azim Shariff, the director of the Culture and Morality Lab at the University of California, Irvine, was an author of a 2016 report in Science that described a series of surveys he and colleagues conducted in which participants overwhelmingly approved of autonomous vehicles, as the study terms them, that would \u201csacrifice their passengers for the greater good\u201d and \u201cwould like others to buy them.\u201d Unsurprisingly, however, they expressed a preference to ride themselves in autonomous vehicles that protect their passengers \u201cat all costs.\u201dEngineers tend to scoff at the trolley exercise. (\u201cI think the vehicle\u2019s going to stop,\u201d Larry Head told me.) But Shariff says this response takes the problem too literally. \u201cThat particular scenario may never come up, but the fundamental ethical trade-off that it\u2019s revealing, apportioning risks among people on the road, is going to happen all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt already does.\u201d Inching closer to a cyclist in the right lane to move farther from a semi on the left, for instance, prioritizes your safety over the cyclist\u2019s. Leaving that \u201cdecision\u201d up to your subconscious becomes its own ethical choice, he added, once \u201cthe luxury of deliberation\u201d embodied by the preprogrammed car exists. Human error contributes to an estimated 95 percent of crashes; in theory, automated and connected cars can eliminate our mistakes. \u201cIf you recognize that one option is safer,\u201d Shariff says, \u201cand you choose the other option, that\u2019s a moral decision.\u201dAt the moment, V2V merely transfers information without dictating how it is used. But as its reach expands, potentially linking drivers, carmakers and telecommunications companies with state, city and local governments and other private and public interests in a vast network orchestrating the use of what are essentially lethal weapons, questions of responsibility become more complicated. V2V-enabled vehicles would broadcast their size, speed, acceleration and braking activity and location (down to the lane), according to the latest standards. Who will be allowed to access that data? Will it remain anonymous, as automakers currently intend? Who will defend the network against hackers and keep up-to-date the critical software that collects, analyzes and translates that data into best practices for each of its users? Do drivers have the ultimate right to control their cars \u2014 even if they want to speed, say \u2014 or should the network be programmed to prevent them from doing so? Should it matter whether they\u2019re flooring it because they\u2019re drunk or delivering a pregnant woman in labor to the hospital?Of course, governments and standards organizations already confront similar utilitarian questions. Early airbags were designed to protect men of average height and weight at the expense of those outside the bell curve; when ambulances run red lights to save a dying patient, they increase the risk of death for everyone around them; a turn-only lane might be safer for bicyclists but worsen vehicle congestion or put a store out of business. Still, each of these decisions can be modified on the micro level by human behavior. The ambulance driver\u2019s experience and his reactions to traffic conditions might mitigate his accident risk. An algorithm applies norms uniformly. Those presets would need to function nationwide, which would require countless entities with conflicting interests and values to submit to a single interpretation of what is best for most people. (Until a majority of cars are fully automated and connected, such a network would most likely behave as the Waze navigation app does, delivering information to human or automated drivers for them to interpret.)Unfortunately, as a species, humans are notoriously inept at acting in our own long-term interest. Imagine an algorithm for hurricane evacuation that moves cars faster than human drivers would \u2014 \u201cbalancing the risk of a more-damaging accident from the higher speed against the benefit of getting people out of the evacuation zone faster,\u201d William Whyte, a prominent automotive cybersecurity consultant, wrote to me in an email. \u201cThat would be an algorithm that on average worked better than current practice but, when it failed, would fail worse. I think that people would probably feel uncomfortable with that in the same way that they feel uncomfortable on planes \u2014 there\u2019s a combination of lack of control plus the fact that if things go wrong, they go very wrong, which triggers all the ways that people are very bad at risk assessment.\u201dWithout federal help, however, the upfront cost of connected infrastructure can be prohibitive for small towns and cities. Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and an affiliate scholar at Stanford\u2019s Center for Internet and Society, recently challenged a group of students to come up with ways to secure public funding for vehicle-to-infrastructure technology that would enable more governments to afford it. One idea was to use the technology at intersections to collect traffic data and sell it to the developers of automated systems to improve their algorithms; another was to use the dedicated bandwidth in cars to create a meshlike internet network for rural areas, eliminating the need to put down expensive fiber cable.Perhaps the most provocative idea, Smith told me, was a \u201ccrash bounty.\u201d He explained: \u201cWe\u2019ve posited that V2I can improve safety \u2014 what if you could come up with a scheme for monetizing that? If you could prove you had prevented a crash, you could bill the people who otherwise would have been injured or killed: \u2018Good news, we\u2019re 80 percent sure that we saved you from an injury that would have cost you tens of thousands of dollars, so, insurance company, pay up $40,000 and be happy with that.\u2019\u2009\u201dTo get a sense of how V2V stands to improve the system as a whole, it helps to understand how cities cope without it. To that end, on a recent Monday morning, just after rush hour, I joined Wilson Aleman and Al Vilar, who have been engineers at the Boston Transportation Department for a cumulative five decades, in the Traffic Management Center on the seventh floor of City Hall. Aleman wore a Red Sox cap. Vilar wore glasses with small eyepieces and thick lenses that gave him the look of a jeweler examining a precious stone.In front of them, a bank of screens displayed live video of various intersections: cars double-parking on narrow, curving roads; pedestrians disregarding stoplights. Aleman could remember when the video screens used to be a board with a real-time LED map on it \u2014 and when the department received postmarked letters of complaint instead of tweets, emails and phone calls. Over the last two decades, Boston has connected 68 percent of its lighted intersections to the Traffic Management Center, allowing engineers to adjust the signaling patterns in real time. The department estimates this has reduced travel times by about 15 percent and emissions and crashes by 8 percent each; it also yields economic benefits of approximately $14 million each year, compared with the $318,000 it cost to implement. Still, much of the traffic data \u2014 which helps to determine optimal signal timing as well as the city\u2019s future investments \u2014 comes from people logging car movements by hand. Widespread V2V would give traffic departments like Boston\u2019s a wealth of detailed information about key locations. (If all cars had V2V, they could blaze through complex intersections without stopping at all, modifying their speeds and headings to slide into gaps.) Maintenance, however, would be a significant challenge.Aleman showed me his computer monitor, where the connected lights were represented on a city map as red or green dots. The red dots were ones that weather, construction or local hardware issues had taken offline. He pointed to two reds very close together on Commonwealth Avenue that could strand cars between them and block cross-traffic. \u201cThose are the ones I like to attack,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are important to me.\u201d The phone rang. It was a communications specialist who was elbow-deep in a control box on one of Aleman\u2019s corners, working on a surge protector. \u201cMaybe if you unplug one at a time?\u201d Aleman suggested.On another phone, Vilar was patiently discussing the timing of a new light on Endicott Street at Keany Square with one of the street\u2019s residents. \u201cWe\u2019ll get it so it\u2019s working better; right now it\u2019s working safer because there\u2019s less cars coming at you.\u201d He paused. \u201cThey\u2019re ready to march on City Hall, I know.\u201d One-way, residential Endicott begins as an offshoot of I-93 North and ends where the causeway and the Charlestown Bridge converge as six lanes. The light makes it slower to turn left. But, Vilar explained once he\u2019d hung up, \u201cwe can\u2019t make it beautiful, because then it will siphon off cars from the causeway.\u201dHe pointed to the Endicott video feed where, sure enough, a line of cars was forming. \u201cSee, now it\u2019s like 14 cars deep, people honking \u2014 you want it to be more serene, especially when you\u2019re eating dinner,\u201d he said. But say those cars weren\u2019t there, and I-93 was backed up, and Google Maps began suggesting Endicott as a shortcut. \u201cSo now you\u2019ve got a guy who just got off there, maybe he\u2019s enraged, instead of going 30 he\u2019s going 40, a kid runs out into the street because he\u2019s not used to the traffic being there. ... \u201d Vilar said. \u201cYou want to make it so it\u2019s moving. You want him to think: I\u2019ll be O.K. I don\u2019t want to get off this street. I\u2019ll stay.\u201d A V2V network could make these sorts of intricate adjustments instantly and indefatigably, but it would do so without Vilar\u2019s empathy for the harried commuter or the family conversing over supper.\u201cSometimes people call,\u201d he said, \u201cand they just want to rant, and you\u2019re just a punching bag for those people, and that\u2019s part of the job.\u201d Vilar grew up in the North End; he, his wife and his children still live nearby. \u201cThe woman who just called, she\u2019s almost like an aunt to me,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has my number.\u201dMore than a century later, in the context of platooning, privacy seems to be able to foster community as much as disrupt it. The dedicated channel over which one truck controls others allows the drivers to converse exclusively with one another, as opposed to using their C.B. radio, which is rife with vulgar chatter. Dave Mercer used to keep his turned off unless he needed news about road conditions. But during the test run, he and Jake Gregory exchanged frequent notes on moves they planned to make or vehicles that the other couldn\u2019t see; Mercer described it as \u201cJake and I looking out for each other on the road.\u201dMight the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in this way reform the macho trucking culture, increasing the diversity of drivers, only 5.1 percent of whom are women? Or might including more varied perspectives in the design process result in even more innovative applications of V2V? The homogeneity at leading technology companies is well documented. Still, it seems notable, considering how infrastructure and power reinforce each other, that of the several dozen engineers, academics and standards developers I spoke with whose thinking is shaping the future of V2V, most were white and all but one was male.Artificial systems evolve \u2014 just as natural systems do \u2014 by applying strict rules to events that are often swayed by chance, and the results are frequently surprising. Relinquishing control of our vehicles to algorithms may ultimately transform us from drivers to passengers who tranquilly observe our surroundings from within our bubble or ignore them altogether in favor of watching a movie or checking email. Then again, by the time that sort of algorithm is ready, more and more of us may choose to depend on ride-sharing applications like Uber and Lyft for personal travel and delivery services, or even 3-D printing for goods we once needed a car to go get and pay for. \u201cI have three daughters; they\u2019re totally uninterested in driving,\u201d Jack Pokrzywa, director of global ground vehicle standards for SAE International, told me. \u201cWhen I got my license, I was 17. I was in seventh heaven.\u201dFor those of us for whom a visit to the D.M.V. was a rite of passage, it\u2019s easy to forget that, before Americans found freedom inside a motor vehicle, they found it on foot and astride horses, in covered wagons and trains, on ships, buses, planes, bicycles, roller skates. They found it in pure motion, on a journey to someplace beyond what they could imagine. Where it began and where it ended was still theirs to decide. Likewise, automated connected vehicles stand to make travel safer, maybe even boring, but somebody still has to get in and tell them where to go.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Silicon Valley Plans to Conquer the Classroom", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEducation DisruptedBALTIMORE COUNTY, Md. \u2014 They call it the \u201cChurch Lane Hug.\u201dThat is how educators at Church Lane Elementary Technology, a public school here, describe the protective two-armed way they teach students to carry their school-issued laptops.And Silicon Valley has embraced the school district right back.Silicon Valley is going all out to own America\u2019s school computer-and-software market, projected to reach $21 billion in sales by 2020. An industry has grown up around courting public-school decision makers, and tech companies are using a sophisticated playbook to reach them, The New York Times has found in a review of thousands of pages of Baltimore County school documents and in interviews with dozens of school officials, researchers, teachers, tech executives and parents.School leaders have become so central to sales that a few private firms will now, for fees that can climb into the tens of thousands of dollars, arrange meetings for vendors with school officials, on some occasions paying superintendents as consultants. Tech-backed organizations have also flown superintendents to conferences at resorts. And school leaders have evangelized company products to other districts.Tech companies have not gone as far as drug companies, which have regularly paid doctors to give speeches. But industry practices, like flying school officials to speak at events and taking school leaders to steak and sushi restaurants, merit examination, some experts say.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be paid by Big Pharma, or Big Ed Tech, to be influenced,\u201d Dr. Boyd said. She has raised concerns about the tech initiative at school board meetings.In a district riven by disparities, Dallas Dance, the superintendent from 2012 through this past summer, made an appealing argument for a tech makeover. To help students develop new-economy skills, he said, every school must provide an equitable digital learning environment \u2014 including giving every student the same device.\u201cWhy does a first grader need to have it?\u201d Mr. Dance said in an interview last year. \u201cIn order to break the silos of equity, you\u2019ve got to say that everyone gets it.\u201dThe district wanted a device that would work both for youngsters who couldn\u2019t yet type and for high schoolers. In early 2014, it chose a particularly complex machine, an HP laptop that converts to a tablet. That device ranked third out of four devices the district considered, according to the district\u2019s hardware evaluation forms, which The Times obtained. Over all, the HP device scored 27 on a 46-point scale. A Dell device ranked first at 34.The district's hardware evaluations for HP, Dell, Apple and Lenovo devices. The winning device: HP.Mychael Dickerson, a school district spokesman, said, \u201cThe device chosen was the one that was closely aligned to what was recommended by stakeholders.\u201d Daly did not respond to inquiries.With the laptop deal sealed, Silicon Valley kicked into gear.In September 2014, shortly after the first schools received laptops, HP invited the superintendent to give a keynote speech at a major education conference in New York City. Soon after, Gus Schmedlen, HP\u2019s vice president for worldwide education, described the event at a school board meeting.\u201cWe had to pick one group, one group to present what was the best education technology plan in the world for the last academic year,\u201d Mr. Schmedlen said. \u201cAnd guess whose it was? Baltimore County Public Schools!\u201dAn HP spokesman said the company did not pay for the trip. He said the company does not provide \u201ccompensation, meals, travel or other perks to school administrators or any other public sector officials.\u201dRecently, parents and teachers have reported problems with the HP devices, including batteries falling out and keyboard tiles becoming detached. HP has discontinued the Elitebook Revolve.Mr. Dickerson, the district spokesman, said there was not \u201ca widespread issue with damaged devices.\u201dAn HP spokesman said: \u201cWhile the Revolve is no longer on the market, it would be factually inaccurate to suggest that\u2019s related to product quality.\u201dAsked what device would eventually replace the Revolve in the schools, the district said it was asking vendors for proposals.A Baltimore County school board member, David Uhlfelder, said a representative from the Office of the Maryland State Prosecutor had interviewed him in September about Mr. Dance\u2019s relationship with a former school vendor (a company not in the tech industry).The prosecutor\u2019s office declined to confirm or deny its interest in Mr. Dance.Mr. Dance, who discussed the district\u2019s tech initiatives with a Times reporter last year, did not respond to repeated emails and phone calls this week seeking comment.Mr. Dance\u2019s travel schedule sheds light on that world.Between March 2014, when the laptop contract was announced, and April 2017, when he announced his resignation, Mr. Dance took at least 65 out-of-state trips related to the district\u2019s tech initiatives or involving industry-funded groups, according to a Times analysis of travel documents obtained under public records laws \u2014 nearly two trips per month on average. Those trips cost more than $33,000. The Times counted only trips with local receipts, indicating Mr. Dance set foot in the cities.At least $13,000 of Mr. Dance\u2019s airline tickets, hotel bills, meals and other fees were paid for by organizations sponsored by tech companies, some of which were school vendors, The Times found. The $13,000 is an incomplete number, because some groups cover superintendents\u2019 costs directly, which means school records may not include them.Another way tech companies reach superintendents is to pay private businesses that set up conferences or small-group meetings with them. Superintendents nationwide have attended these events.ERDI offered several service levels this year, according to a membership rate card obtained by The Times. A $13,000 fee for Bronze membership entitles a company to one confidential meeting, where executives can meet with five school leaders to discuss products and school needs. Diamond members could pay $66,000 for six such meetings.The Education Research and Development Institute, known as ERDI, charges membership fees to school vendors to arrange small-group meetings with superintendents who can provide product feedback.\u201cBecause we are asking for their time and expertise, we commonly offer to pay the cost of their food, transportation and lodging during their participation,\u201d ERDI\u2019s president, David M. Sundstrom, said in an email.Mr. Dance\u2019s calendar indicated that he had attended at least five ERDI events.Mr. Dance received payment last year as an adviser for ERDI, according to his most recent district financial disclosure. It lists Dulle Enterprises, a company that owned ERDI in the past, as an employer from which he earned income.Last February, at an ERDI conference in New Orleans, Mr. Dance met with Curriculum Associates, which makes reading software, as well as DreamBox Learning, a math platform.A DreamBox spokeswoman said there was no connection between the meeting and its contract. \u201cEven the appearance of impropriety is something we take very seriously and take steps to avoid,\u201d she said.A Curriculum Associates spokeswoman said: \u201cThese panels are not sales presentations, but rather focus-group opportunities to solicit feedback on products under development.\u201dMs. White, the interim superintendent, has been involved with ERDI since 2013, according to Mr. Dickerson. He said Ms. White used vacation time to attend events, where she \u201cprovided guidance to education-related companies on goods, services and products that are in development to benefit student performance.\u201dAsked whether Ms. White had received ERDI payments, Mr. Dickerson said, \u201cParticipation in ERDI is done independently of the school system.\u201d In an email, Ms. White said she found ERDI to be a \u201cbeneficial professional learning experience.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond to a question about ERDI compensation.She added, \u201cI do not believe there are any conflicts of interests\u201d related to the district\u2019s tech initiative.Mr. Sundstrom, ERDI\u2019s president, said education companies pay a fee to attend events \u201cnot to meet school leaders or make a sale,\u201d but to get meaningful feedback on their education products from knowledgeable school leaders. He added that school officials do not make purchases at ERDI sessions and that it is their school boards that approve district purchases.Baltimore County\u2019s travel rules say, \u201cNo travel expenses will be paid by those seeking to do business with the Baltimore County Public Schools prior to obtaining a contract.\u201d Mr. Dickerson explained that applied to companies currently bidding for contracts.\u201cYou have these huge contracts, and then you donate all this money, and the foundation puts up a banner advertising your company\u2019s name,\u201d said Michael J. Collins, a former Maryland state senator and former school board member. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think that passed the smell test.\u201dDiscovery Education said it trained employees to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Microsoft said its policies followed government gift and ethics rules. Pearson said its donation had been nominal and vetted to prevent conflict of interest. McGraw-Hill said it was committed to integrity and transparency.When asked if the foundation had policies governing donations from vendors or potential vendors, Ms. Phelps said no. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s not necessarily a policy,\u201d she said. There is also no policy prohibiting foundation board members who are vendors from reviewing grants involving their or competitors\u2019 products, she said.Mr. Dickerson said the focus of Baltimore County Public Schools was on \u201csupporting students, teachers and their learning environments.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are unapologetic for engaging with our Education Foundation, business partners and community stakeholders in an effort to close known achievement gaps.\u201dMr. Reich of Stanford suggested school districts establish clearer rules governing their relationships with vendors, particularly with tech companies racing to win over the gatekeepers to America\u2019s classrooms. Otherwise, parents could lose trust in the system.\u201cSchool leaders should be just as concerned about the perception of corruption as actual corruption,\u201d he said.Lilia Chang contributed reporting from Washington, and Jeremy Merrill from New York.

{"Headline": "The Tax Plan\u2019s Corporate Losers and Winners: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday morning from Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. We\u2019re watching how the Justice Department might be trying to negotiate some sort of concession from AT&T and Time Warner. More on that in a moment.Now that the House has released its tax overhaul bill, the plainly named \u201cTax Cut and Jobs Act,\u201d expect more and more opposition from groups that stand to lose. That includes businesses from across the spectrum.Here are some groups that would be disadvantaged by provisions of the legislation, at least in its current form:Expect no small amount of lobbying from those businesses \u2014 and from lawmakers in high-tax states, who continue to demand more favorable deductions for state and local taxes.Behind the Broadcom moveOne of the few surprises from yesterday was the announcement that Broadcom \u2014 the chip maker built from a series of acquisitions over the past decade \u2014 plans to relocate its legal headquarters to Delaware from Singapore. While the move isn\u2019t dependent on the tax bill going through, Hock Tan, Broadcom\u2019s famously reticent C.E.O., publicly told President Trump at a news conference: \u201cThanks to you, Mr. President, business conditions have steadily improved.\u201dAT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner is a vertical merger that doesn\u2019t lead to consolidation within one particular industry, leaving few legal options. Mr. Trump has publicly opposed the merger, but the Justice Department\u2019s new antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has said that he won\u2019t let politics sway his decision-making.But other than Andrew Liveris of DowDuPont, it appears that none of the corporate leaders who served on any of the now-disbanded presidential councils is going. G.E., which had a seat on the president\u2019s manufacturing council when Jeff Immelt was C.E.O., is sending a lower-level executive.Mr. Trump is bringing 29 chief executives to Beijing, where the administration hopes to announce billions of dollars of new deals for American industry. But officials are playing down expectations that China will agree to any meaningful opening of its markets.But as social media has become increasingly connected to unpleasant bickering, race-baiting and Russian propaganda, the must-have \u201csocial\u201d label has become an albatross, said Joseph Bayer, an assistant professor at Ohio State University who focuses on social networks.Part of the reason is that, by spreading untruth and outrage, corroding voters\u2019 judgment and aggravating partisanship, social media erode the conditions for the horse-trading that Crick thought fosters liberty.More on Russian meddlingElsewhere in techThe planned departure of Mr. Mercer as Renaissance Technologies\u2019 co-chief executive has come amid protests aimed at university endowments, foundations and pension funds with money invested in the hedge fund.[David] Randall of the Baltimore retirement fund compared the decision to redeem money from Renaissance to the decision of whether to invest in a tobacco company or gun manufacturer. He said Renaissance is one of the fund\u2019s best performing investments.Others are staying put with Renaissance. Michigan State University\u2019s endowment has no plans to withdraw its $50 million, for example.Don\u2019t expect Mr. Mercer to withdraw from conservative politicsDespite trying to distance himself from Steve Bannon (by selling his investment in Breitbart to his daughters) and its former technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos, Mr. Mercer will remain a big financier for conservative causes, The NYT added.\u201cThis seems to me much more like Robert Mercer separating \u2026 his image from his moneymaking capacity than an actual disassociation with the people he funded for so long,\u201d said Ben Shapiro, the former editor-at-large at Breitbart who broke with the site in 2016. \u201cYou hear about this and you have to wonder what else they were spending money on.

Her son, however, kept losing weight \u2014 first a little, then a lot. \u201cIt was a dark time for me,\u201d she said.After getting conflicting advice from experts, Ms. Halsall, a Chicago native who was living in San Francisco with her fianc\u00e9e, then did what many frustrated new mothers do these days. She turned to Google.\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized I was a second-class citizen in the eyes of the internet,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to download an app for breast-feeding, and they were all clearly made by men, and they were all horrible.\u201dEighty-two percent of children born each year are born to millennial mothers. That\u2019s five out of every six babies. And their parents \u2014 let\u2019s call them \u201cparennials\u201d \u2014 are challenging all sorts of commonly held beliefs about the American family.Let\u2019s examine their innovations one at a time.\u201cThe good news is that parents know more about child development than ever before,\u201d she said. \u201cGoogle is the new grandparent, the new neighbor, the new nanny.\u201dThe bad news is that parents feel overwhelmed by the volume of information, confused about the \u201cright way\u201d to do things and harshly judged by friends and relatives.Kate Flynn, 32, lives in Brooklyn with her 11-month-old daughter, Isla, and her college sweetheart, Michael. Like many new parents, she felt unprepared for the responsibility. \u201cWe feel like kids who aren\u2019t old enough to have kids,\u201d she said.\u201cI\u2019ll be on the phone with my mom and say, \u2018The app is telling me that she is starting her 9-month sleep progression,\u2019\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cI just found out that Wonder Weeks only goes to when the child is one. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s liberating or scary.\u201dMany parennials, accustomed to chronicling every fab appetizer and every failed job interview, give their children YouTube channels from the first sonogram and hashtags when they\u2019re born.\u201cI knew I wanted to name her Bryn, but when considering middle names, there were a couple of \u2018A\u2019 names we were thinking about. We chose Bryn Avery because I could get the Twitter handle @BrynAvery,\u201d Ms. Mauskopf said.Others, like Kassandra Ortiz, 26, a stay-at-home mother of two in Brooklyn, are warier. After being stalked online by a classmate who posted her photo along with comments about what he wanted to do to her, Ms. Ortiz considers herself \u201coverly protective\u201d of her children.\u201cI like taking pictures of my kids walking away, so I avoid showing their faces,\u201d Ms. Ortiz said. \u201cI have this fear that if I post a picture on Instagram, then my child will become a meme.\u201d\u201cFor 30 years we\u2019ve been asking, \u2018Can women have it all?\u2019\u201d Mr. Harrington said. \u201cNow we\u2019re asking if men can have it all.\u201dGabe Wells, 33, a loan officer, was born in Iowa and moved to Portland, Ore., with his wife, Caitlin, who was his girlfriend at the time. When she became pregnant, the two went through a \u201crough patch,\u201d he said, and went into counseling.\u201cThe No. 1 thing I learned is that my language changed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t say \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018father\u2019 anymore. I say \u2018co-parent.\u2019 It sounds odd to people in the Midwest, but it\u2019s more reflective of what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201dThey realize 50-50 is \u201ca pipe dream,\u201d he said. \u201cBut If we can trade off going 60-40, that\u2019s great.\u201dCo-parenting does come with downsides. Ms. Parlakian of Zero to Three said she\u2019s begun to detect a new theme in her annual surveys of parents. She calls it \u201cgate-keeping,\u201d when the less-involved parent tries to step up but the primary parent slaps the partner down, saying \u201cYou did it the wrong way\u201d or \u201cWhy did you put the baby in that?\u201d\u201cGiven the statement \u2018I would like to be more involved with raising my child but my parenting partner interferes with my involvement,\u2019 nearly half the dads agree,\u201d Ms. Parlakian said, \u201cwhile only 16 percent of moms do.\u201dFrom her experience running Winnie, Ms. Halsall has concluded that \u201cmillennial dads are different than their elders, in that they see it as a positive masculine trait to be involved with their children,\u201d she said.\u201cThe idea that women are more proactively issuing feedback to their co-parents that are male to me sounds very encouraging. It\u2019s an indication that they see each other as partners.\u201dNew parents of all ages often face money woes, but with parennials these challenges can feel particularly acute because they reached childbearing age during the Great Recession, are saddled with college debt and are perhaps job-hopping or part of the gig economy.As a result, many parennials rely on their own baby boomer parents for financial support. Ms. Ortiz has started a photography business on the side while her husband, who hopes to get into real estate, drives for Uber. To make ends meet, they get financial help with rent from her mother-in-law.\u201cMoney has always been an issue, but we do our best and hope God will provide,\u201d Ms. Ortiz said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a millennial thing, but we spend so much money eating out. We\u2019d be better off if we didn\u2019t.\u201dJess Laird, 31, grew up in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan with parents who were \u201cbroke actors,\u201d she said, so she\u2019s used to money struggles. She was working full-time when she had her first child at 29, but wanted to spend more time with her daughter. Since then, she has worked at a start-up that went out of business and now freelances remotely. She is still paying off her undergraduate loans, and her husband, Morgan, is doing the same with his law school debt.With so much financial pressure, they rely on her mother for child care.\u201cOther moms I talk to who are 35 or 40 seem to be more settled financially,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels weird when I say, \u2018My mom is taking care of my kid.\u2019 I even use the word \u2018mother\u2019 because it sounds more adult.\u201dGender roles are not the only thing being challenged by parennials; other social norms are experiencing upheaval as well. Pew has found that almost four in 10 Americans married since 2010 have a spouse who is a different religious group, double the number from 1960. Nine in 10 millennials approve of interracial marriage or cross-cultural marriage.The disdain of Andrew Moore, 33, and his wife, Rachel, 31, for religion has caused friction with his family, who were missionaries. \u201cMy mom just doesn\u2019t talk about it,\u201d said Mr. Moore, a physical scientist who is the father of Harrison, 2. \u201cMy father asked me, not long after I told him I was nonreligious, whether I would raise my children Christian. I was, like, \u2018No, man, I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019\u201dThe one thing they\u2019re teaching him, he said, is \u201cSome people get value from religion, and he might, too, as long as he realizes that what\u2019s good for him might not be great for another.\u201dThis sense of fluidity, of improvisation, of \u201cmaking it work\u201d in the words of one couple, or \u201cgetting by\u201d in the words of another, appears to be an early, unifying theme of millennial parents. Maybe it\u2019s their uncertain economic status, their sense of experimentation, or simply the times they grew up in, but many parennials seem less rigid than their elders.\u201cI thought we were supposed to do things a certain way,\u201d said Ms. Flynn of Brooklyn, who had multiple jobs and multiple apartments when she was in her 20s. \u201cHave the career, the house, the green grass, and then the kid. But that didn\u2019t happen. My life has a different plan.\u201cHaving a kid when things are unstable like this,\u201d she said, \u201cfeels like a start-up.

{"Headline": "Breaking News of a Texas Church Shooting Required Accuracy and Sympathy", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tranquillity of a Sunday afternoon in the newsroom was shattered earlier this week with an unconfirmed report of a shooting at a church in Texas.Just before 1 p.m., Dataminr, an online platform that scours Twitter for breaking news, alerted us with a \u201cFlash,\u201d the highest level of importance, regarding a tweet that read:PSA: Active shooter with 15 ppl down at the baptist church in Sutherland Springs down my road, be careful everybody\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0fI\u2019m the weekend editor on the Express Team, where breaking news is one of our primary missions. The tweet immediately seized our attention, but it proved difficult to confirm: It was a Sunday, and government offices were closed; the rural nature of the area made it challenging to find addresses for neighbors; and the police, at the moment, were offering no details.For eight minutes after the initial alert, there was not another tweet about Sutherland Springs or an active shooter. I started to get restless. Could this be a false alarm?Regardless, we started to cast a wide net. Zach Johnk, a senior staff editor, looked at the community on Google maps. There was not much to see: a couple of churches and gas stations, a Dollar General store. Maggie Astor and Christina Caron, both reporters, started to call the stores, local law enforcement, government officials and hospitals. Ms. Caron also checked public records for residents we could call, but reaching people in this rural community proved difficult.By about 1:15 p.m. a few more tweets had started trickling in, and I tweeted back to as many people as possible, asking them to please call me or Ms. Astor.Some news outlets, almost all of them citing social media posts, also reported there were \u201cnumerous\u201d dead and wounded. However, we needed someone in authority \u2014 a coroner, a police officer or someone from the sheriff\u2019s office \u2014 to confirm what happened. Accounts on Twitter were from people discussing the event, but they were not witnesses. The goal was to reach at least one official or one person with firsthand knowledge.Unofficial accounts in breaking news are almost always inaccurate, and social media can amplify the echo chamber of incorrect details. For instance, the early erroneous media reports of the massacre in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 \u2014 reports that falsely suggested there was a second shooter and an additional victim in Hoboken, N.J. \u2014 still resonate with me.Meanwhile, I could feel a pit in my gut as the minutes ticked by and we repeatedly called law enforcement agencies and other officials to no avail. Calls to local residents were also fruitless. Every time we hit a wall, we tried a new tack \u2014 and then another.Finally, through Twitter, I was able to reach someone close to the scene, Joseph Silva. He agreed to take some pictures of the emergency responders, email them to me and describe what he saw.We were at last able to post our first article about 3 p.m. and build on our reporting in several updates. And as time went on, the scale and horror of what happened came into sharper focus.The extent of the tragedy was driven home when I got a call from a parishioner, Sandy Ward. She was among several parishioners I found on a Facebook page for the church; I\u2019d left a message for her hours earlier.My interview with Ms. Ward was extraordinary. We\u2019d spoken for about five minutes before she told me that three of her grandchildren and a daughter-in-law had been shot. Her grandson, 5, was shot four times and was in surgery, she said. At the time of our conversation, she was still awaiting word on her other family members.I was struck by the unfailing politeness and consideration she showed by calling me back from a hospital at a time of great personal crisis. I wished her strength and healing. She asked for prayers.Maybe it was my adrenaline starting to ebb or maybe it was this up-close example of the enormous tragedy that befell a small Texas community \u2014 but at the end of the interview, I could feel my voice starting to crack.I got off the phone and took a moment to regain my composure. There was more work to do.I still have not had the heart to look for updates about her relatives.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Trumpets Its Cloud Lead With N.F.L. and Other Deals", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 The holidays are a time when there are constant reminders of how much Amazon dominates online shopping \u2014 the boxes stacking up on front porches, for example.It\u2019s also when Amazon puffs its chest out to say how big it is becoming in a different and much more profitable market: technology used by businesses.One of the customers that Amazon revealed, the National Football League, illustrated how cloud computing is moving beyond basic capabilities like online storage. Those abilities first attracted start-ups and large corporations to the concept of renting computing services from an internet company, rather than running it all themselves.The N.F.L. said it would use Amazon\u2019s advanced machine-learning capabilities \u2014 software that helps recognize patterns and make predictions \u2014 to quickly analyze data captured during games. The data could provide new kinds of statistics for fans and insights that could help coaches.The N.F.L. and Amazon declined to discuss the financial terms of their relationship.Amazon also announced a handful of other new machine-learning efforts. Customers using A.W.S., as the cloud division within Amazon is often called, will be able to add capabilities that mimic human cognition, such as automatic transcribing of speech to text and analysis of videos. Those services are usually expensive and daunting for many companies to add to their applicationsA.W.S. started as a curious side project for the internet retailer more than a decade ago. It has since mushroomed into one of the most important technology providers. It brought in over $12 billion in revenue for Amazon during the first nine months of the year, up 42 percent from a year earlier.More important, A.W.S. generated almost $3 billion in operating income, an enormous benefit to a company which brings in little to no profit from its retail operations.Amazon has caught most of the industry by surprise with its growth into a cloud computing powerhouse. Two rivals, Microsoft and Google, have shown the most determination to narrow Amazon\u2019s lead. Both competitors are also investing heavily in giving machine-learning capabilities to customers.Urs H\u00f6lzle, Google\u2019s senior vice president of technical infrastructure, said his company saw the biggest opportunity in winning over the huge numbers of customers who have not yet shifted their computing chores to the cloud, rather than convincing those that have already adopted Amazon\u2019s services to do so.\u201cFor us to grow very quickly, we don\u2019t need to steal A.W.S. users,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Managing Email on Multiple Devices", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech TipCompared with POP, IMAP is a newer technology for managing messages and handles checking the same mail account on multiple devices much more smoothly. With IMAP, even though you can see your mailbox in the mail program on your computer and devices, IMAP messages actually live on the mail server. When you read, delete or flag a message, you are performing that action on the mail server. The mail apps on your other devices see the change when you view the updated mailbox.In contrast, most POP mail systems in their default settings download messages directly to the device that checks in at the time, and then deletes those messages from the mail server. When you check mail with your computer or other gadgets, those devices do not get the deleted messages, but they may download newer ones \u2014 which then get deleted from the server, making your mailboxes out of sync.As a workaround, some mail providers allow you to keep messages on the server without deleting them automatically after they download, but then you have to repeatedly delete a message on each device. Additionally, the messages you send stay on the Sent mailbox of the computer or device that actually did the sending.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Four More Zzzs for Snooze City", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s gotten to the point that the mayor has decided to reclaim the label.There is a valid argument for the goodness of being boring, particularly when it comes to politicians (Mussolini: not boring). But what about the spinoff effect? Has our boring mayor made us more boring along the way? Or, even: Is he our creation? What if every era in New York gets the mayor it deserves?Say the words \u201cKoch years,\u201d and a flood of images pours forth (bankers in yellow ties, break dancers, gay bathhouses with caution tape across the doors). Ditto with \u201cDinkins years\u201d (the \u201cgorgeous mosaic,\u201d tennis rackets, Crown Heights riots), \u201cGiuliani years\u201d (squeegee men, Derek Jeter, Twin Towers) or \u201cBloomberg years\u201d (bike lanes, luxury condos, waterfront parks). Love \u2019em or hate \u2019em, each of them had their drama.At last, here\u2019s an image that floods to mind: \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afDespite the presence of Mr. Sanders, the hall was maybe half full. Efforts to get a \u201cfour more years!\u201d chant faded quickly as the mayor, looking like a retired Knicks power forward (he is 6-foot-5), rose to tower over the podium in a gray suit and yellow power tie.\u201cI want to start with a tale of audacity,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, sounding more amiable than audacious, before ticking off his administration\u2019s accomplishments, which included universal pre-K, two rent freezes and free legal counsel for people facing eviction.\u201cBernie Sanders defines the idea of audacity,\u201d he said, showing America\u2019s left \u201cthat we had a power that we didn\u2019t even know we had.\u201dA crowd of union members in red jackets sipped beer from plastic cups in the back. That seemed fitting: The affable, jocky Mr. de Blasio, more than any mayor in memory, certainly fits the time-honored political test of \u201cwho would you want to have a beer with?\u201d (If you tried to play quarters with Mr. Giuliani, he\u2019d probably arrest you for gambling.)But the mayor tacitly acknowledged that he is more of a conduit for a political philosophy than a lightning rod.\u201cThe candidate matters,\u201d he said, quoting a Sanders talking point, \u201cbut the movement matters even more.\u201dThe problem is that Mr. Giuliani long ago cemented his legacy as the crime fighter mayor in the public imagination, however deserved that may be. Any mayor who follows is simply Crime Fighter 1B.That is the outsider\u2019s view, anyway. To those who work in or around city politics, this administration has been anything but dull. The mayor \u2014 at times feisty, at times aloof \u2014 has become embroiled in countless headline-grabbing tussles with the tabloids, the police force and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat. He has had to fight off both a state and federal investigation into his fund-raising.Legacy, however, is about perception, not policy, and when it comes to perception, timing is everything. It is neither fair nor sane to credit (or blame) a mayor with everything that happens in the city on his watch. Everyone does it anyway.New Yorkers, for example, tend to forget the patronage scandals and crack wars of the years under Mayor Edward I. Koch. What they remember is \u201cHizzoner,\u201d a cuddly cartoon vision of an irrepressible New Yorker who we think brought New York back from the dead.Not that Mr. Koch had much to do with the booming stock market, which flooded the streets with Salomon Brothers bonus money that heated up the market for TriBeCa lofts, bad installation art and squid-ink pasta to surface-of-Mercury levels. Mayor Koch was not out there on the floor at Danceteria, teaching a young Madonna her moves, or scribbling rhymes for Slick Rick, or guiding Basquiat\u2019s paintbrush. But it is all part of the lore of the \u201cKoch years.\u201dMayor de Blasio, by contrast, inherited a city that was in fine health, but even so, we\u2019re left feeling around for its pulse.This creeping bouge-ification that left the city a sea of chain stores and Starbucks did not happen overnight. But even Mr. Bloomberg had the Strokes.Even so, the aging hipsters who forever croak about the grit and glamour of the bad old days will hardly find solace in a New York where CBGB is still a John Varvatos boutique, smoking remains taboo unless we\u2019re talking lox at Barney Greengrass, and the police hand out $190 tickets for running a red light ... on a bicycle. Sodom and Gomorrah this ain\u2019t.Maybe we should count it as a blessing that, after a four-decade journey back from the brink, New York as a whole has, for what may be a very brief moment between recessions and terror attacks, the luxury of worrying about small things.On a recent trip home to Brooklyn on the F train, for instance, I spotted a poster sponsored by the Office of the Mayor. \u201cMidnight Snack,\u201d the message read, over a close-up of a raccoon\u2019s masked face. \u201cLike all New Yorkers, raccoons know where to find a good meal. Please don\u2019t feed NYC\u2019s night life.\u201dYou could say this expenditure of city resources on a marginal issue was a measure of a city shrinking in its historical mission. Or, you could say it is a sign of victory. For now.Advertisement"}

Smash that like!Men under 65 may suffer from all kinds of things. The problem isn\u2019t only erectile dysfunction, for which Hims offers sildenafil (the generic name of Viagra, $20 per month); there\u2019s also the sensitive issue of hair loss, for which Hims offers finasteride (the generic form of Propecia, $28.50 per month).Both are pharmaceutical drugs requiring prescriptions, which Hims offers via its staff of five staff physicians making diagnoses via online consultation, whose fees are included in the service\u2019s prices. Prescriptions can be filled through Hims\u2019 own network of pharmacy partners, or sent to patients\u2019 current pharmacies for pickup. (Hims, which does not accept insurance, serves 18 states in the U.S.)The site also sells over-the-counter options like minoxidil (known to older people as Rogaine), DHT-blocking shampoo said to promote hair growth, gummy biotin vitamins, and, coming soon, skin care and more.Its models (some nonmodels, Mr. Dudum said) are young, handsome, tattooed and multiethnic, many found and photographed in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. The palette, site and packaging design is coolly minimal: millennial pink gone masculennial beige.\u201cWhen you look at the brand, at the tone, it\u2019s incredibly casual,\u201d Mr. Dudum said. \u201cThere\u2019s run-on sentences. Punctuation\u2019s in the wrong place. It\u2019s meant to be said out loud. We need to talk to guys as if we\u2019re that older cousin, the uncle at the family barbecue who says, \u2018Dude, why are you balding right now?\u2019\u201dRegarding the look of previous marketing and branding efforts, Mr. Sperduti said, \u201cWhat came to your mind first was what came to all of our minds. We just kind of started listing out all the things we knew we wanted to be diametrically opposed to.\u201dMr. Dudum declined to share specifics about sales, but the millions raised in funding suggest backers confident in the prospect of direct-to-consumer telemedical health. (Mr. Dudum is also a founder and general partner of Atomic, a venture capital fund.) In any case, Mr. Dudum said, the response has already outstripped expectations.\u201cWe have reordered everything, when we didn\u2019t think we were going to have to do that for months,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are pretty far out exceeding every number we thought was possible by a pretty large sum. We\u2019re just shocked at the amount of people coming in.\u201d The market is likely to only grow when erectile dysfunction drugs like Cialis go off-patent, which could happen as early as September 2018.At Roman, which addresses itself specifically to erectile dysfunction, response has also been strong. Roman offers several prescription drugs (sildenafil \u2014 both generic and Viagra \u2014 Cialis and Levitra) and acts as a conduit between physicians and customers, rather than employing its own doctors, although it does operate its own pharmacy, where its participating doctors can send prescriptions for fulfillment. (Roman refers to this as a \u201ccloud pharmacy.\u201d) Prices range from $2 to $63 per pill, plus $15 for the medical consultation.Those prescriptions may also be sent to any pharmacy, but at Roman\u2019s own, you can get your packages delivered in a plain brown box, with doses portioned into single-serve packets for wallet- and pocket-friendliness.\u201cWhen you think of a Roman man, you think of this shredded guy on a pedestal ready for battle,\u201d said Mr. Reitano, the former entrepreneur in residence at the venture firm Prehype. \u201cWe wanted to redefine what that actually means. What that means to us is someone who tackles their health head on. Not the \u2018rub some dirt on it, walk it off\u2019 mentality that people are brought up with. While that might work for a charley horse, it doesn\u2019t enable you to be the best partner to your significant other, and it doesn\u2019t enable you to stay around as long for your children.\u201dPart of the appeal of Roman and Hims is the ability to sidestep a potentially awkward face-to-face conversation with a doctor, one of the boons of the emerging field of telemedicine. The potential downside, of course, is misdiagnosis or abuse, as Dr. Steven Lamm, the director of the Tisch Center for Men\u2019s Health at N.Y.U. Langone, and a medical adviser to Roman, acknowledged.\u201cErectile dysfunction is often a barometer of a man\u2019s health,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a potential for it really to be a reflection of vascular disease. You want to be certain you have the right screening procedures to rule out the person who is inappropriate to be put on this. I think the companies that are going to be initiating this field understand that. They\u2019d have to be idiots not to.\u201dHowever, he said, he was bullish on the prospect, as Roman may bring men unaccustomed to regular doctor\u2019s visits into the medical fold. (Roman offers an incentive for men to visit their own physician after their diagnosis, in the form of a rebate.)\u201cThe bottom line, we\u2019ve always known that the area of sexual medicine is a common entrance into the health care system,\u201d Dr. Lamm said. \u201cMen generally wait until things are broken before they go to the doctor.\u201dWith phone in hand, the doctor is in, and solutions are at hand. For an erection lasting longer than four hours, slide into their DMs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Facebook\u2019s Oracular Algorithm Determines the Fates of Start-Ups", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "FeatureThe platform is so good at \u201cmicrotargeting\u201d that many small e-commerce companies barely even bother advertising anywhere else.Supported byOne night in the summer of 2015, over Sichuan at Han Dynasty on 85th Street, Cogan asked Horwitz for advice about his latest notion: selling contact lenses online. The contacts business was dominated by a handful of companies like Johnson & Johnson and Bausch & Lomb, which seemed to charge whatever they wanted \u2014 at least in Cogan\u2019s view, based on the price increases for his own lenses. Surely a low-cost competitor could tempt away customers. Cogan pulled his laptop from his bag and opened it at the table in the middle of dinner, pushing aside plates of dumplings and scallion pancakes. He had two plans to show Horwitz. They could sell a cheap disposable lens to doctors. Or they could mimic Cogan\u2019s employer, a wildly successful start-up called Harry\u2019s.By late 2015, Harry\u2019s, which sold safety razors and shaving cream, was in the vanguard of upstart online retailers known as direct-to-consumer companies. The business model works like this: Firms sell only their own products, only through their own websites. By cutting out retailers and distributors, they can charge less for their specialty products than entrenched competitors. That year, Casper, then a direct-to-consumer mattress and bedding seller, was reported to be on track to exceed $100 million in sales in its second year of business. Dollar Shave Club, another seller of razors, had reached $152 million in revenue. Warby Parker, the eyeglasses purveyor that many credit with pioneering this business model in 2010, had recently closed an investment round that reportedly valued the company at $1.2 billion. Venture capitalists \u2014 convinced that consumers would increasingly patronize specialty online retailers as they grew more comfortable shopping online \u2014 were pouring money into direct-to-consumer start-ups, more than $2 billion over the past four years, according to CB Insights.Horwitz, by now bored in his job, pushed Cogan to keep pursuing his idea and volunteered to help him do research. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to intellectualize whether an idea is good or not,\u201d Horwitz says. \u201cYou have to just start doing it and see.\u201dBy February 2016, after many nights and weekends of emailing Asian manufacturers and reading up on Food and Drug Administration compliance, the vision of a viable business was coming into focus. The pair had found an F.D.A.-approved manufacturer in Asia and figured out how to meet the necessary regulations. Still, Cogan was reluctant. He had been accepted to Wharton and had even put down a deposit. He believed that was the smarter option. At best, the contact-lens business would become a side project.Before shelving their venture, they decided to try one more tack. They recruited two friends: Paul Rodgers, a buddy of Horwitz\u2019s from Columbia who knew how to write computer code, and Dan Rosen, a friend of Cogan\u2019s from Bronx Science who was handy with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Together the four built what is known in the world of online retailing as a demand experiment. The technique, credited to Harry\u2019s founders (who give away its basic code), amounts to a two-page website. The first page explained the concept of a monthly subscription for contacts and asked those who were interested to submit their email addresses. Visitors who did so were taken to a second page and were made an offer: Share this referral code with friends, and if enough of them sign up, you\u2019ll get free contacts.They posted a link to their site on the walls of about 40 Facebook friends. Within a few days, not only had their own friends signed up, but friends of friends of friends had, too \u2014 some 2,000 people in all. Some of those distant connections were even evangelizing the company on their own Facebook walls. \u201cIt went mini-viral,\u201d Cogan says.He and Horwitz applied to tech incubators \u2014 organizations that invest in and coach young companies in exchange for minority stakes \u2014 using the demand experiment as one slide in their 16-page PowerPoint presentation. They pitched a few venture capitalists based in New York as well. They decided that if they were admitted to an incubator, they would work on the project full time. If not, Cogan would go to Wharton. By April, they had not only been called back for interviews with five incubators; venture funds were also offering to invest a total of $3.5 million in their idea.Cogan dropped his Wharton plans. He and Horwitz ordered 50,000 contact lenses and, with Rosen as creative director and Rodgers as chief technology officer, began working out of their investors\u2019 offices, stacking boxes and boxes of lenses along the walls by their desks. They eventually named their enterprise Hubble, after the orbiting telescope that can see into deep space.Facebook helped them succeed with their demand test; now it would generate their first sales. During the summer of 2016, a friend of one of Hubble\u2019s prospective investors, a start-up veteran named Joshua Liberson, recommended that the founders try a new type of Facebook advertising called Lead Ads. No outside website was needed: Would-be customers simply clicked a button on the ad to submit their email addresses, directly from Facebook. Hubble directed its ads to ZIP codes in New York and Chicago, where they had already signed up optometrists willing to write prescriptions. After people clicked the ads, Horwitz emailed them to coordinate appointments and take their orders.When Hubble\u2019s online store opened officially on Nov. 1, 2016, Cogan and Horwitz knew how to run a Facebook advertising campaign, and they were confident it would continue to generate sales. They planned to spend the additional $3.7 million they raised almost entirely on Facebook ads.In considering Facebook\u2019s far-reaching influence, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind the perspective of the more than five million advertisers whose money is financing the social network\u2019s rampant growth. For them, Facebook and Instagram, which the company also owns, are the stuff of fantasy \u2014 grand bazaars on a scale never seen before. By advertising directly in users\u2019 news feeds, companies can, at any time of day, target potential customers at moments when they are often bored and open to novelty. What better time to hear a product pitch?\u201cFacebook created the world\u2019s greatest infomercial,\u201d says Roger McNamee, a founder of Elevation Partners, who invested early in Facebook but has since become critical of the company\u2019s influence. \u201cIt\u2019s really inexpensive to produce ads and unbelievably inexpensive to reach exactly the market that you\u2019re looking for.\u201d As a result, Facebook has become especially lucrative for companies trying to sell new products online. The leaders of more than half a dozen new online retailers all told me they spent the greatest portion of their ad money on Facebook and Instagram.\u201cIn the start-up-industrial complex, it\u2019s like a systematic transfer of money\u201d from venture-capital firms to start-ups to Facebook, says Charlie Mulligan, the founder of BrewPublik, which uses a \u201cBeergorithm\u201d to deliver personalized selections of craft beers to customers every month. At 500 Startups, the tech incubator based in Silicon Valley that funded BrewPublik, Facebook advertising is a topic covered in classes. In fact, social-network advertising is an assumed prerequisite for anyone studying marketing at a tech incubator these days \u2014 or at any business school across the country. \u201cThere is a formula for this stuff,\u201d Mulligan says. \u201cAnd the reason why there is a formula is because it works.\u201dThe process is easy, cheap and effective. With a few hundred dollars and a morning\u2019s effort, an entrepreneur can place his or her ads before social-media users that same afternoon. Companies unsure which ads are best can upload a handful of them and let Facebook\u2019s artificial-intelligence software test their efficacy. If they don\u2019t know who should see their ads, they can embed code on their websites that enables Facebook to monitor the traffic and then show ads to recent visitors. Or companies can send the email addresses of their existing customers to Facebook, and it will locate their Facebook accounts and put ads in front of so-called Lookalikes, users who like and click on the same things that your proven fan base does. It\u2019s all about as straightforward as setting up an online dating profile. Steph Korey, a founder of Away, a luggage company based in New York that opened in 2015, says that when the company was starting, it made $5 for every $1 it spent on Facebook Lookalike ads.The ease of opening a business on Facebook has in turn spawned a wild proliferation of specialty digital sellers that depend on the social network\u2019s algorithm to find their early customers. Many of them follow the same playbook and even share a similar aesthetic. They spend money on traditional public relations, on sponsored links that appear next to Google search results and on \u201cinfluencer\u201d marketing, or giving away their product to people with large social-media followings, in hopes of creating buzz. Then they buy ads on Facebook and Instagram. Inevitably you will encounter them there: They feature a sleek photograph or a video loop of a product \u2014 a wood-handled water filter, woolen shoes, an electric toothbrush. At the top, in bold, the company\u2019s name appears, often ringing with the same friendly, typically two-syllable whimsy. Soma. Allbirds. Goby.\u201cSometimes we\u2019ll look at each other and say, \u2018God, there are just so many of them,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Ellie Wheeler, a partner at the venture fund Greycroft Partners, which invested in Hubble last year. Her firm has also taken ownership stakes in Thrive Market, which sells health foods; Plated, a meal-kit delivery service; Trunk Club, which mails a box of clothes to its customers; and Eloquii, a fast-fashion retailer specializing in plus sizes.While not all of these companies and others like them will survive, plenty are encroaching on established brands, which are taking the threat seriously. In July 2016, Unilever, the European consumer-products conglomerate, acquired Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1 billion. In June, Walmart agreed to buy Bonobos, an internet-based apparel brand, for $310 million. Companies that sell products exclusively online continue to grow faster than any other type of retailer in the United States \u2014 some 17 percent annually since 2011, more than six times the rate of retail over all, according to Euromonitor International.And Facebook has even been taking steps to influence offline sales, in order to bring traditional retailers into its orbit. In September, the social network introduced a tool that lets businesses with physical stores show ads to shoppers and their Lookalikes even if they visit the store but don\u2019t buy anything. Day by day, Facebook is extending its reach further and further into the American marketplace.The basic building block of Facebook advertising is an ad set. It consists of the ads themselves and choices in three other categories: audience, goal and budget. That day, Rosen was designing a set to reach an audience of people on Instagram who had visited hubblecontacts.com in the past 30 days. His goal was \u201cconversions,\u201d or persuading users who had seen the company\u2019s ad to make a purchase. Finally, he set a budget of $1,000 per day. He uploaded the three images. Now they were ready to be tested, to see if any of them were winners in the eyes of users and the algorithm.This detailed handicapping process involves thousands of advertisers per auction. Millions of auctions take place every minute as users across Facebook load their feeds. The process is never the same twice. The algorithm is constantly learning, using past results to inform how it weighs bids in the next auction. The intent, Facebook says, is to maximize value for everybody: to pair the advertiser with its likeliest customers, and to show ads that users want to see. And, of course, to make money for Facebook.But from Rosen\u2019s perspective, nothing much had happened before he ambled into the office a little after 10 a.m. Facebook had spent a grand total of $1.86 on his ads. It had shown the first ad to 51 people, the second to 45 and the third to only two. The first ad had been clicked once. Rosen, unperturbed, poured himself a cup of coffee from the single-serve machine. The algorithm takes a little while to get warmed up, he said. \u201cIn an hour, it\u2019ll get exciting.\u201dTwenty minutes later, Rosen refreshed his browser. The Ads Manager window displayed the latest numbers: Rosen could see only the results, not the process that produced them, but it seemed as if the click had inspired the algorithm to favor the first ad. During those 20 minutes, the first ad appeared before 76 more people \u2014 that is, it won 76 more auctions than the other two ads. Over the next hour, the algorithm showed the first ad, which featured a photo of colorful Hubble boxes against a blue background, to more and more users; the algorithm had begun to favor it, apparently. As Rosen refreshed his browser, the sensation was like watching a seed sprout. The ad got more views. Some led to clicks. And eventually, sometime between 11:28 a.m. and 11:53 a.m., one of those clicks led to the test\u2019s first sale. Commerce was in bloom.The moment felt odd. Obviously there was science behind the scenes; the algorithm was a set of rules written by Facebook engineers. But from where Rosen sat, the operation might as well have been run by the Holy Spirit. Facebook\u2019s artificial-intelligence algorithm had wound its way through the server farms, reached out among two billion users, found an individual and showed her a Hubble ad on Instagram \u2014 and she used her credit card to buy a subscription for contact lenses.In quick succession, the first ad generated two more sales. The algorithm started increasing how much it bid on Hubble\u2019s behalf, thus winning even more auctions for ad space and spending more of Hubble\u2019s money on it \u2014 first $1 a minute, then $2 a minute, then more than $3. By 2 p.m., Facebook\u2019s A.I. had charged Hubble $306.50 to put that ad in front of 9,684 users. The second ad, after an outlay of $8.03, had been all but abandoned. And the third ad was hardly given a chance: Since 8 a.m., it had appeared before only 30 people.\u201cNo idea why,\u201d Rosen said, shaking his head. Rosen could see all sorts of data arranged in neat rows on Facebook\u2019s Ads Manager program: the number of views, clicks, sales and the average cost, in advertising, of acquiring each new customer. But none of the metrics at Rosen\u2019s fingertips could resolve a fundamental mystery: why the algorithm behaved as it did, why it preferred some ads over others and why the third ad got little attention whatsoever.The morning\u2019s ads were incredibly similar: \u201chubblecontacts,\u201d the company\u2019s Instagram handle, appeared at the top, above pictures of boxes in peach, blue, yellow and green. The only differences were that the first ad showed the boxes of contact lenses lined up against a blue background; in the second and third ads, they were set against a split pink-and-blue background and were arranged diagonally in the second and scattershot in the third. But they were all just boxes! Did Instagram users really prefer contact-lens ads with strict rows of boxes or blue backgrounds? Had rules been written into the algorithm favoring orderly arrangements? (The Hubble team knew Facebook favored certain aesthetics.) To what extent was the day\u2019s outcome, apparently set in motion when the first ad happened to get that first click in the morning, actually random? Rosen could only guess.In the early 2010s, direct-to-consumer companies showboated. But lacking the money for big TV ad campaigns, they relied instead on old-fashioned public relations, panache and luck. Warby Parker hired a public-relations firm to pitch its concept to Vogue and GQ and debuted its website on the same day issues reached subscribers. It also held an event featuring bespectacled models at the New York Public Library during Fashion Week. Dollar Shave Club first succeeded on account of the exquisite timing, both commercial and comedic, of its founder, Michael Dubin. He made a funny, low-budget video introducing his company, then uploaded it to YouTube on the same day TechCrunch reported Dollar Shave Club\u2019s first round of venture funding. Within days, after some immediate attention at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., Dubin had three million views online.Facebook\u2019s sales pitch \u2014 putting the right ad in front of the right person, thanks to the wonders of data technology \u2014 isn\u2019t exactly new. As far back as 1964, William Allan, a business editor for The Pittsburgh Press, reported that in the near future, \u201ccomputers will tell businessmen which half of their advertising budgets are being wasted.\u201d Thirty years later, The Economist described an effort to take advantage of American Express\u2019s transactional records: \u201cPowerful data-crunching computers known as massive parallel processors, equipped with neural-network software (which searches, like the human brain, for patterns in a mass of data), hold out a vision of marketing nirvana.\u201d Companies like Acxiom, Experian and Datalogix have been offering similar data-mining services to direct marketers for years. What sets Facebook (and Google) apart are scale and sophistication.A recent study by a Princeton professor, Arvind Narayanan, and a doctoral candidate, Steven Englehardt, provides a sense of how thoroughly the two online giants monitor user behavior. In early 2016, they examined the top one million websites in the world, using special bots they developed to scour them for tracking mechanisms. Google had trackers on 76 percent of these sites, Facebook on 23 percent of them. (Twitter, in third place, had trackers on just over 12 percent of the sites.) The tech giants can examine all this data looking for patterns and then match them back to prospective customers.What also sets Facebook and Google apart from their direct-marketing forebears is that they give access to everyday advertisers. Anyone with a credit card can go online and test ads on Facebook\u2019s platform, one of the most sophisticated direct-marketing operations ever. But while average people can use the machine, there\u2019s still a lot of mystery about how it works. The methods and calculations of the algorithm \u2014 why it ends up pushing some ads and not others \u2014 are all hidden.Almost as soon as they began, Rosen, Horwitz and the others at Hubble became determined to fathom the algorithm\u2019s secrets \u2014 to figure out why some ads succeeded and others didn\u2019t. Soon they were trading hypotheses with other entrepreneurs, cribbing ideas from other companies\u2019 ads and taking a formal approach to testing, rooted in the scientific method. They uploaded ads with identical images but different wordings, for example. The Hubble team wound up concluding all sorts of things. Ads with third-party endorsements \u2014 from GQ, say, or BuzzFeed \u2014 beat those with their own slogans. Ads featuring close-ups of the Hubble boxes outperformed those with human models. Ads that included a button that said \u201cShop Now\u201d or \u201cLearn More\u201d fared worse than an ad with no button at all; viewers simply preferred to click anywhere on the picture to go to the website.But even as the Hubble team gleaned more about what yielded successful Facebook ads, the algorithm could be unpredictable, almost moody. If you kept loading the same ads into the same ad set every day, they stopped performing as well. The founders figured at first that users were tiring of the same ads. But actual viewer numbers revealed that practically no individual user had seen any ad more than once. The algorithm itself seemed to grow bored. At night, meanwhile, the algorithm spent lots of money and rarely found customers. The Hubble executives started shrinking the budgets at 11 p.m., which they called \u201cputting the algorithm to bed.\u201d The algorithm could also be impulsive and streaky \u2014 some days it might go on a sudden jag, blowing a thousand dollars in a few hours with nothing to show for it. At any time, any one of the 15 different ad sets might go haywire. Rosen found himself checking the Ads Manager compulsively on his laptop and his iPhone. (Facebook offers an iOS app for advertisers.) \u201cIt occupies my brain constantly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling of \u2018Did you leave the oven on?\u2019\u2009\u201dOne night we went to a standup-comedy night Rosen hosted at a bar called Muchmore\u2019s in Brooklyn. (For the past four years, he has moonlighted as a comedian.) But while the other comics were onstage, Rosen was on the Ads Manager the whole time. \u201cWho cares about jokes?\u201d he quipped afterward.Eager for help, Rosen sought guidance from a former Facebook employee named Faheem Siddiqi, who now runs his own marketing agency. Hubble\u2019s sales representative at Facebook told him that Siddiqi had figured out the best ways to optimize Facebook advertising campaigns. But it turned out that Siddiqi and his employees checked the Ads Manager even more compulsively than Rosen \u2014 every half-hour, for up to 16 hours a day. When I asked Siddiqi to share his tips for managing Facebook ads, he replied, \u201cStep\u20091 is meditation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a baby,\u201d Jesse Horwitz told me. \u201cIf you go more than half an hour without checking in on it, it\u2019s probably dead.\u201d (Horwitz, who is married, does not yet have children.)Recently ProPublica, the investigative-journalism nonprofit, showed how bad actors can abuse this process: Facebook\u2019s software gave advertisers the option to target \u201cJew Haters,\u201d for instance. In a separate investigation, ProPublica found that Facebook made it possible to exclude specific \u201cethnic affinities\u201d from seeing ads, noting that ads excluding people based on race are prohibited by federal housing and employment laws.This stereotyping isn\u2019t a glitch of Facebook\u2019s machine-learning process \u2014 it\u2019s how the software works. To formulate audiences, the algorithm scours profiles and analyzes them for shared traits and correlations and self-identified interests and, it assumes, our preferences, grouping us into tribes that can be targeted. It\u2019s up to Facebook and advertisers to constrain this amoral process in ethical and lawful ways. Yet the ethics of targeting are not clear-cut. In May, The Australian reported that Facebook employees had prepared a document showing how they could gather details on teenagers during vulnerable moments \u2014 when Facebook users feel \u201cstressed,\u201d \u201cinsecure,\u201d \u201cdefeated\u201d or \u201cworthless.\u201d Is that immoral, or simply crass?Such challenges are opening a new front for companies and corporate-responsibility watchdogs. Bad human actors don\u2019t pose the only problem; a machine-learning algorithm, left unchecked, can misbehave and compound inequality on its own, no help from humans needed. The same mechanism that decides that 30-something women who like yoga disproportionately buy Lululemon tights \u2014 and shows them ads for more yoga wear \u2014 would also show more junk-food ads to impoverished populations rife with diabetes and obesity.\u201cSometimes data behaves unethically,\u201d Antonio Garcia-Martinez, a former Facebook employee who worked on the advertising team, wrote in an essay in The Guardian. He provided an example from his time at the company: \u201cSomeone on the data-science team had cooked up a new tool that recommended Facebook pages users should like. And what did this tool start spitting out? Every ethnic stereotype you can imagine.\u201dAs algorithms sort users in increasingly complex ways \u2014 already the multivaried criteria for determining a Lookalike group defies human comprehension \u2014 regulators and companies will have to confront how to determine who is being nudged, and why, and whether that\u2019s benefiting the public or exacerbating societal ills. An algorithm that draws its lessons from the present reality can\u2019t be counted on to improve the course of the future on its own.Facebook\u2019s A.I. isn\u2019t operating unattended, certainly: Garcia-Martinez wrote that Facebook decided not to release the recommendation tool. Facebook points out that it makes efforts to prevent harmful advertising. It does not, for instance, allow ads for payday loans, which prey on the poor. It says it has removed advertisers\u2019 ability to target users by ethnicity when promoting housing, employment or credit; it removed \u201cJew Haters\u201d and other objectionable categories and said it would increase human review of its ad-targeting options. In response to the report in The Australian, Facebook said the analysis \u201cwas intended to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook. It was never used to target ads.\u201dYet managing a platform this way \u2014 seeing what mischief the algorithm and its users gets up to, then responding with countermeasures \u2014 can be difficult to sustain. \u201cThis is a whack-a-mole problem, one among many Facebook has,\u201d Garcia-Martinez told me. It makes Facebook, a company still largely controlled by a single man, Mark Zuckerberg, the ultimate arbiter of morality and taste for all two billion of its users. It also means the company has unilateral power to make or break companies when it tweaks its system.This is not a hypothetical possibility. In 2013, media sites like those measured by the BuzzFeed Partner network, which includes BuzzFeed, Thought Catalog and The New York Times, noticed a huge surge in referrals from Facebook \u2014 a jump of more than 50 million page views from August to October. A year later, Facebook announced that it had adjusted its news-feed algorithm to eliminate so-called click bait. Upworthy, a peddler of stories with headlines like \u201c9 Out of 10 Americans Are Completely Wrong About This Mind-Blowing Fact,\u201d had its total page views decline by half in the span of three months, from 90 million to 48 million visitors. (At the time of these huge shifts, 30 percent of Americans got news from Facebook. In 2017, 45 percent of Americans do, according to Pew Research Center.)\u201cWe always knew that Facebook is sort of like the weather,\u201d says Eli Pariser, Upworthy\u2019s co-founder and president. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be sunny days and stormy days.\u201d In response to the algorithm adjustment, Pariser instructed his staff to stop posting as many videos to YouTube, which is owned by Google, and start publishing more videos directly to Facebook instead.\u201cThat certainly served Facebook well,\u201d Pariser admits. \u201cBut you know, I also wouldn\u2019t be able to reach 200 million people on any other medium,\u201d he says, citing the reach of Upworthy\u2019s videos on Facebook. The platform may be mercurial, but Upworthy still relies on it.Imagine, now, that Facebook tweaks its algorithm in a way that \u2014 rather than cause wild swings in web traffic\u200b \u200bto a purveyor of viral videos \u2014 leads to a steep decline in advertising and sales for a consumer-products company, one that happens to be the largest employer in a small town. Or imagine\u200b \u200bmultiple\u200b \u200bcompanies shaken up by such an adjustment, or an entire industry overhauling its practices\u200b \u200bto suit Facebook.\u200b \u200bEven the threat and uncertainty of those possibilities could\u200b \u200bhurt\u200b \u200bbusinesses, which depend on predictable returns to invest in future projects.As we delegate more control to artificial intelligence, both businesses as well as users are venturing into uncertain territory. In the meantime, more and more companies \u2014 start-ups, mom-and-pop stores, major corporations \u2014 are handing their dollars and their data to the social-networking giant. Facebook\u2019s Ads Manager is user-friendly. Sales are plentiful. And if you don\u2019t take advantage of it, your competitors will. How could you not go there?But by the end of June, Rosen\u2019s stress-free life was still a dream. A new problem arose: No matter what new ads they put in an ad set, the growth rate of sales declined and the cost per acquisition went up. They began to think it was an audience problem: Had they found all the customers in those groups? With their ad sets going fallow, the Hubble team scrambled to find fresh and fertile ground. Their ideas for new audiences got quirkier, more outlandish. One week they zeroed in on people who like Sweetgreen, the salad chain. Next they went after people who had indicated that they were fans of bottled water, whoever they are. Each group fizzled after a few days \u2014 the cost per each new customer climbed higher and higher; sales dwindled. As they searched for more and more audience descriptors, they landed upon a novel idea: They began trading their Lookalike groups with other online retailers, figuring that the kind of people who buy one product from social media will probably buy others. This sort of audience sharing is becoming more common on Facebook: There is even a company, TapFwd, that pools together Lookalike groups for various brands, helping them show ads to other groups.Cogan and Horwitz have decided that they need to reduce their dependence on Facebook advertising, for the sake of their business and their own sanity. In May, they tested their first 15-second cable-television commercials. With TV, the data is vaguer, and it takes longer to get results back. Yet even though the old medium provides them with less information than Facebook, in some ways the ignorance is bliss. \u201cThere\u2019s fewer levers; there\u2019s less to stress out about.\u201d Rodgers says. \u201cYou can push the button and get on with your life.\u201dIn August, the Hubble team finally handed over their domestic Facebook advertising work to an outside agency, Ampush, that charges them based on how many new customers sign up. Ten people at Ampush now do the job of Rosen and Robo-Dan. Still, the handoff was bittersweet. \u201cWe ran their numbers \u2014 it\u2019s something we could beat,\u201d Rosen says, meaning Hubble could get more customers for less money if it did the ad buying in-house. \u201cBut it would destroy our lives.\u201dThanks largely to Facebook, Hubble is on track to finish its first full year in business having made $20 million in revenue. In August, Hubble raised $10 million, valuing the company at $210 million. In January, Hubble will use those funds to expand its business to Continental Europe. Its advertising strategy? Robo-Dan, with some help from Rosen. As Hubble advances into new territories, Facebook and the algorithm will be tagging along with them.Burt Helm is a senior contributing writer for Inc. magazine.

{"Headline": "Waymo\u2019s Autonomous Cars Cut Out Human Drivers in Road Tests", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The self-driving car is edging closer to becoming driverless.Waymo, the autonomous car company from Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, has started testing a fleet of self-driving vehicles without any backup drivers on public roads, its chief executive said Tuesday. The tests, which will include passengers within the next few months, mark an important milestone that brings autonomous vehicle technology closer to operating without any human intervention.Dozens of companies are testing self-driving technology on public roads across the United States and some autonomous features are available in today\u2019s cars. But Waymo is believed to be the first company to test vehicles on public roads without a driver ready to take over in an emergency.\u201cOur ultimate goal is to bring our fully self-driving technology to more cities in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d John Krafcik, Waymo\u2019s chief, said in prepared remarks at a technology conference in Portugal on Tuesday. \u201cFully self-driving cars are here.\u201dThe tests are a show of engineering prowess by Waymo at a time when traditional automakers and other tech companies like Uber race to develop similar vehicles.Waymo said its driverless cars hit the public roads last month. The company did not say whether it was testing the driverless cars in environments considered challenging for autonomous vehicles, like bridges or tunnels, or more difficult conditions, like driving at night or in rain and snow \u2014 usually not a big concern in the dry Phoenix climate.Once passengers join the tests, they will be able to contact Waymo support staff with a button inside the car. If the cars are involved in a crash, they are programmed to respond appropriately, including pulling off the road on their own.Driverless cars are regulated by a patchwork of state laws. Arizona, like many states, has no restrictions against operating an autonomous vehicle without a person in the driver\u2019s seat. On the other hand, California, where Waymo is headquartered, requires any self-driving car to have a safety driver sitting in the front.In December, Waymo published a report for California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles about how frequently its car \u201cdisengaged\u201d \u2014 deactivating its autonomous mode because of a system failure or safety risk and forcing a human driver to take over. In the report, Waymo said this happened once every 5,000 miles the cars drove in 2016, compared with once every 1,250 miles in 2015.Consumer Watchdog, a frequent critic of Alphabet, said that data demonstrated that the cars are not ready to drive without any human intervention and that Waymo was following the Silicon Valley model of \u201cbeta testing\u201d a new technology on the public.\u201cIt\u2019s the wrong approach when you\u2019re dealing with self-driving cars,\u201d said John M. Simpson, a director at Consumer Watchdog. \u201cWhen things go wrong with a robot car, you kill people.\u201dResearchers believe self-driving cars can be safer than cars operated by human drivers because they are programmed to adhere strictly to traffic laws, they don\u2019t get distracted, and they usually refrain from taking unnecessary risks.Timothy Tait, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Transportation, said the state was on pace to exceed 1,000 automobile-related fatalities this year and that its top priority is the public\u2019s safety \u2014 particularly by advancing efforts to reduce crashes and deaths on its roads.\u201cWe are closely monitoring emerging technologies like self-driving cars that may ultimately support safer travel and open up opportunities for populations who today are unable to drive for themselves,\u201d he said in a statement.In his remarks, Mr. Krafcik said Waymo sees a ride-hailing taxi service as the first commercial application of the company\u2019s driverless car technology, though there could be other uses in logistics and public transportation.Taking the human out of the equation will fundamentally change transportation and change how people buy cars, said Mr. Krafcik, who was an executive at Hyundai Motors before joining Google.\u201cBecause you\u2019re accessing vehicles rather than owning, in the future, you could choose from an entire fleet of vehicle options that are tailored to each trip you want to make,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be designed for specific purposes or tasks.\u201dFollow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwakaAdvertisement"}

In America, mixed-race identity tends to invite both curiosity and suspicion, largely because few have found a way to interrogate it without centering whiteness as the scale by which to evaluate blackness. Those who fumble at this examination are burned online. (For recent examples, Google \u201crace and Tinashe\u201d or \u201crace and painting and Zadie Smith.\u201d)It\u2019s with this trepidation that I approached \u201cReal American,\u201d Julie Lythcott-Haims\u2019s new memoir about growing up biracial. But any fears that I initially had about the book were laid to rest by two gut-wrenching lines near the beginning that show the author intends to probe not her blackness but rather America\u2019s perception of it. \u201cI come from people who survived what America did to them,\u201d she writes. \u201cI\u2019m so American it hurts.\u201d Lythcott-Haims, the author of \u201cHow to Raise an Adult,\u201d was the dean of freshmen at Stanford University, and she began writing poetry in 2007, after reading Lucille Clifton; the pacing of \u201cReal American,\u201d staccato at times, rushed and frenetic at others, infuses the book with a lyricism that hums with the frustration and sadness she felt growing up what she calls \u201cun-Black.\u201d Her feelings metamorphose into palpable anger and resentment as she reaches adulthood, and she finally begins to grasp the perversity of a system that tries to undermine black Americans from the moment they arrive in the world.What sets Lythcott-Haims\u2019s book apart from others is that she doesn\u2019t seem to be contextualizing the experience for white people \u2014 she\u2019s working through the issues that she\u2019s faced all her life, unpacking them in an effort to isolate and extract them, as a surgeon might inspect a cancerous cluster of cells before excision.The most moving parts of \u201cReal American\u201d come when Lythcott-Haims stares unflinchingly at her own self-loathing, writing about the racist encounters of her childhood that convinced her from a young age that there was something inherently wrong with being black.Here, the book threatens to veer into that \u201csunken place,\u201d as Lythcott-Haims laments giving birth to a fair-skinned daughter, whom she names Avery. She takes Avery outside, holding her up to the strong California sun. \u201cDarken her. Make her mine,\u201d Lythcott-Haims writes. \u201cI felt her lightness lessened my Blackness,\u201d she continues, as if racial identity were contained in a skin tone. But she saves it with vulnerability, with a stunning and painful admission. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ashamed of Avery,\u201d she concedes. \u201cI was ashamed to be me.\u201d These feelings of self-loathing \u2014 that she felt uncomfortable being black, was even afraid of other black people \u2014 are not easy things to admit, but important and inherent and instructive to understanding how a culture of whiteness can affect a person of color.Lythcott-Haims never comes to a tidy conclusion about how to view race relations in America, because there isn\u2019t one. By allowing us to witness a woman coming to terms with herself, and finding nothing but pride and love there, she offers a blueprint for how others might try to do the same.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine.Advertisement"}

Lawmakers questioned Facebook \u2014 as well as Google and Twitter \u2014 about how Russians may have misused online ads and other parts of their platforms to sow discord and inflame tensions in the American electorate.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that you\u2019re here, and not your C.E.O.s,\u201d Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, said during a hearing on Wednesday morning.In a statement, Mr. Zuckerberg added, \u201cProtecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d noting that the amount of money Facebook is spending on security will affect the company\u2019s bottom line.On Wednesday, Facebook said its online ads business rose by 49 percent to $10.1 billion for the quarter. Much of that success continues to hinge on its ability to make money from people using smartphones; some 88 percent of Facebook\u2019s advertising revenue is derived from mobile devices.The performance was bolstered by Facebook\u2019s push into video advertising, which the company has prioritized for the past two years. Advertisers are generally charged more for video ads than static ads because of the engaging nature of the content.Mr. Zuckerberg said video would remain a top priority for the company\u2019s revenue growth over the next three years. David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, also earmarked video as an area for heavy investment in 2018.That spending will go into Facebook\u2019s nascent efforts of funding new original shows for streaming, specifically on the social network. Money will also go toward making video products more \u201csocial,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg, as a way to strengthen the bonds between the people who regularly use Facebook.Another reason for the successful quarter: user growth. Already home to more than two billion people who regularly use the social network every month, Facebook\u2019s number of users grew another 16 percent to 2.07 billion people. Some 1.37 billion people use the site on a daily basis.To make sure that growth stays on track, Facebook plans to spend even more. The company said it employs more than 23,000 full-time workers, up 47 percent from the same period a year ago. Facebook reported more than $1.76 billion in capital expenditures.More hiring is in the works. During this week\u2019s hearings, Facebook executives said they planned to hire 10,000 more workers to increase safety and review content across the platform, doubling to 20,000 reviewers. Facebook and other companies typically use less expensive third-party companies, not full-time in-house employees, to review content.Facebook also said it would keep investing in its still-fledgling virtual and augmented reality businesses.The company also made clear that even as it has faced grilling from lawmakers over what has been posted and shared on its site by Russian actors, it will not go overboard by stifling free expression on the social network.\u201cWe believe that ads are important to free expression,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said during the earnings call. \u201cBut we will also do our part to elevate the quality of those ads.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Its net loss was $443.2 million \u2014 nearly four times the size of the loss a year ago and more than twice as large as what analysts had predicted. About half of that loss was because of the cost of stock-based compensation that the company pays its employees.Snap added 5 million users to its Snapchat messaging service from the previous quarter, but that, too was below estimates from Wall Street, which expected 8 million new users.Snap\u2019s chief executive, Evan Spiegel, said revenue growth had been hurt by the company\u2019s move to automate its ad-buying process. That transition caused ad pricing to drop by about 60 percent from the previous year, he said, though the change is now largely complete.\u201cI am grateful that this transition is nearly behind us,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said on a call with analysts. \u201cThis has been a good test for our business.\u201dMr. Spiegel also said that Snap was redesigning its app to make it easier to use and that the company would focus on user growth in 2018, as well as on content and augmented reality. In the past, Mr. Spiegel has said little about Snap\u2019s product strategy. Unlike many other companies, Snap also does not give an estimate for future revenue in its earnings report.Mr. Spiegel\u2019s talk of goals for 2018 and notes of contrition were a welcome change. For the past two quarters, analysts have expressed frustration over Mr. Spiegel\u2019s unwillingness to give guidance about the company\u2019s product strategy. On stage at a recent conference, Mr. Spiegel said that he needed to do a better job communicating with investors.Snap also indicated it was cutting back on Spectacles, its video recording sunglasses. The company said it had \u201cmisjudged strong early demand for Spectacles\u201d and wrote off $39.9 million of the sunglasses in the quarter.Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said there remained reasons for optimism about Snap and he questioned Wall Street\u2019s focus on user growth.\u201cThe last time I checked this isn\u2019t a subscription business,\u201d he said of Snapchat. \u201cThey\u2019ve done really well retaining their users.

{"Headline": "How a Radio Shack Robbery Could Spur a New Era in Digital Privacy", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The case that could transform privacy law in the digital era began with the armed robbery of a Radio Shack store in Detroit, a couple of weeks before Christmas in 2010. In the next three months, eight more stores in Michigan and Ohio were robbed at gunpoint.The robbers took bags filled with smartphones. Their own phones would help send them to prison.Experts in privacy law said the case, Carpenter v. United States, No. 16-402, was a potential blockbuster.In a pair of recent decisions, the Supreme Court expressed discomfort with allowing unlimited government access to digital data. It limited the ability of the police to use GPS devices to track suspects\u2019 movements, and it required a warrant to search cellphones.The court\u2019s decision, expected by June, will apply the Fourth Amendment, drafted in the 18th century, to a world in which people\u2019s movements are continuously recorded by devices in their cars, pockets and purses, by toll plazas and by transit systems. The court\u2019s reasoning may also apply to email and text messages, internet searches, and bank and credit card records.In addition to presenting testimony, prosecutors relied on months of records obtained from cellphone companies to prove their case. The records showed that Mr. Carpenter\u2019s phone had been nearby when several of the robberies happened. He was convicted and sentenced to 116 years in prison.Mr. Carpenter\u2019s lawyers said cellphone companies had turned over 127 days of records that placed his phone at 12,898 locations, based on information from cellphone towers. Prosecutors could tell whether he had slept at home on given nights and whether he attended his usual church on Sunday mornings.Relying on the Smith decision\u2019s \u201cthird-party doctrine,\u201d federal appeals courts have said government investigators seeking data from cellphone companies showing users\u2019 movements also do not require a warrant.Professor Kerr said Congress was better suited than the courts to strike the right balance between the government\u2019s need for information and privacy rights. In Mr. Carpenter\u2019s case, he added, the Fourth Amendment should not apply because there was no search.\u201cModern cellphones are not just another technological convenience,\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the court. Even the word cellphone is a misnomer, he said. \u201cThey could just as easily be called cameras, video players, Rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, libraries, diaries, albums, televisions, maps or newspapers,\u201d the chief justice wrote.But the Riley case concerned information possessed by the person arrested. Mr. Carpenter\u2019s case concerns information held by cellphone companies.All nine justices agreed that this was problematic under the Fourth Amendment, but they were divided on the rationale for the decision. The majority said the police were not entitled to place the device on private property. But five justices in concurring opinions expressed unease with the government\u2019s ability to vacuum up troves of private information.\u201cThe use of longer-term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy,\u201d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for four justices. \u201cSociety\u2019s expectation has been that law enforcement agents and others would not \u2014 and indeed, in the main, simply could not \u2014 secretly monitor and catalog every single movement of an individual\u2019s car for a very long period.\u201dCellphone tower information is not nearly as accurate as that generated by GPS devices, but it is catching up.Mr. Rosen, who favors broad privacy protections, said Mr. Carpenter\u2019s case could transform Fourth Amendment law however the court rules.\u201cIf the court squarely recognizes what it\u2019s been suggesting in recent cases, namely that we do have an expectation of privacy in our digital data and public movements and that the Fourth Amendment prohibits the government from tracking us door to door for weeks in public, that would be an occasion for dancing in the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the court holds that we don\u2019t have an expectation of privacy in public except when there is some sort of physical trespass involved, that could be a huge setback for privacy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Self-Driving Trucks May Be Closer Than They Appear", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "With fewer cultural hurdles and more financial incentives than car owners, big-rig operators are charting the route to an autonomous future.Supported byTrucks will someday drive themselves out of warehouses and cruise down freeways without the aid of humans or even a driver\u2019s cab \u2014 about that there seems little disagreement. The question is how soon that day gets here.And while the answers vary \u2014 technologists, not surprisingly, are more bullish than truckers \u2014 billions of dollars and a growing parade of companies, from tiny start-ups to the country\u2019s biggest trucking operations, are betting it will be here sooner than most people think.This year, companies and investors are on pace to put just over $1 billion into self-driving and other trucking technologies, 10 times the level of three years ago, according to CB Insights, which tracks the venture capital industry.Tesla is widely expected this week to showcase an electric truck that will have some self-driving capabilities. And Embark, a Silicon Valley start-up, is set to announce on Monday that it has been testing its self-driving technology as part of a three-way partnership with the truck-leasing company Ryder and the appliance giant Electrolux.\u201cWe are trying to get self-driving technology out on the road as fast as possible,\u201d said Alex Rodrigues, Embark\u2019s chief executive. \u201cTrucking needs self-driving and self-driving needs trucking.\u201dUnlike autonomous cars, which face questions about navigating chaotic urban streets, trucks spend a lot of time heading straight on desolate highways. And while the advent of the self-driving car will rest on the decisions of individual consumers, logistics companies are unemotional operators that will upgrade their fleets the moment it makes financial sense.Trucking is a $700 billion industry that touches every corner of the economy. Trucks haul natural resources from mines and forests. They transport industrial building blocks from manufacturers and deliver goods to stores and homes. Virtually every physical product from food to paper towels and furniture has touched a truck several times by the time it gets to a consumer\u2019s hands.The industry\u2019s size makes it a fat target for automation. Autonomous technology will help trucking companies reduce labor costs in the long run, first by extending the number of hours trucks are in operation, and later, by reducing the number of drivers. The industry spends billions of dollars a year on accidents that are largely caused by human error, and billions more on insurance premiums that should go down if and when self-driving technology is proven to be safer than human drivers.Even companies not explicitly chasing the goal of self-driving trucks are moving steadily toward a more automated future. The 7,000-plus trucks owned by US Xpress, one of the nation\u2019s largest trucking companies, have been updated with autonomous braking and collision-avoidance systems. Max Fuller, the company\u2019s co-founder and executive chairman, plans to upgrade them to have automated lane steering in three years.\u201cI\u2019m putting building blocks into my trucks that each year gets us closer and closer,\u201d he said.Companies have a lot to get through before they can start legally operating trucks without drivers. Beyond technical and regulatory hurdles, the industry is sure to be challenged by wild cards like how human drivers react to seeing a unmanned truck gliding down the highway and how regulators respond when the inevitable first deadly autonomous-trucking accident occurs. If such a backlash were to happen before the technology has been widely adopted, it could slow things for years.But whenever self-driving trucks arrive, there will be economic ripples, affecting insurance premiums, truck stops, vocational schools and the roads themselves. \u201cThis is the most powerful thing to hit us since the building of the superhighways in the 1950s,\u201d said No\u00ebl Perry, an economist at FTR Research, which tracks the logistics industry.One afternoon in Florida, a 59-year-old career truck driver named Jeff Runions sat alertly in the cab of an 18-wheeler watching the road while his 11-ton cargo of stone tile made its way up the Ronald Reagan Turnpike. He was watching his steering wheel, too, but his hands were at his side: A computer was in control.Mr. Runions works for Starsky Robotics, a San Francisco start-up that for the past two years has been testing its self-driving technology by running freight up and down Florida. The runs help collect data and hone the technology, in hopes of convincing regulators and the company itself that self-driving trucks are ready for business.There are still plenty of kinks. Sitting next to Mr. Runions was an Irish engineer named Rebecca Feeney Barry. As the vehicle spent hours driving past swamps and billboards for accident lawyers, Ms. Feeney Barry balanced a laptop on her knees and watched how the truck\u2019s sensors interpreted the road and nearby cars.At one point the computer\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d briefly lost sight of the freeway because an overpass shaded the road. Later, the truck didn\u2019t take a turn hard enough, prompting Mr. Runions to grab the wheel. Ms. Feeney Barry logged all of it. Later, after some computer code had been altered to tell the truck to tug the wheel a bit harder, it made a similar turn more smoothly.\u201cSometimes it kind of messes me up when I go back to driving because now I\u2019m used to the truck driving,\u201d Mr. Runions said.Starsky\u2019s ultimate plan, of course, is to eliminate Mr. Runions\u2019s job. But they do not want him to be out of one. Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Starsky\u2019s 27-year-old chief executive, foresees using self-driving technology to replace long-haul drivers on freeways, but having people like Mr. Runions navigate at either end of the trip with remote control consoles that look like an arcade racing game.Drivers would go off to work in offices and might spend their day driving trucks through the last few miles of several different routes in several different cities before heading home for dinner.\u201cOne driver can drive 10 to 30 trucks per day,\u201d Mr. Seltz-Axmacher said.Starsky\u2019s vision of a remote operation is unique. But the basic idea \u2014 having trucks drive themselves on highways and letting human drivers take over in complicated city environments \u2014 is something of an industry consensus.\u201cOne of the big misconceptions about self-driving technology is that it is going to emerge and be able to drive all the time in all circumstances,\u201d said Alden Woodrow, the product manager for Uber\u2019s self-driving truck unit.As part of their partnership, Embark, Ryder and Electrolux are conducting what amounts to elaborate dry runs to imagine what self-driving-truck routes will look like. The runs start with human drivers leaving an Electrolux warehouse in El Paso and driving to the edge of the city, where they hitch the trailer to one of Embark\u2019s autonomous trucks.From there the truck drives itself for 650 highway miles (with a safety driver in tow) to Ontario, Calif., where the Embark drivers transfer their trailer to another Ryder driver, who drives the final few miles to one of Electrolux\u2019s California warehouses.\u201cIt\u2019s a mirror of what we would do if there weren\u2019t a driver inside,\u201d said Mr. Rodrigues, the Embark chief.A few miles from Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., a company called Peloton Technology is betting that there is a business to be built in a less radical version of automation. Peloton is on the cusp of rolling out a system that will make it easier and safer for trucks to travel one after the other on the highway, in a formation called platooning, helping them save gas by reducing wind drag.Trucks with drivers already do this. But Peloton\u2019s technology aims to make platooning safer with a mix of cameras, sensors and networking equipment, allowing the trucks to talk to each other and helping to prevent the second driver from ramming into the first truck after a sudden stop.Josh Switkes, the company\u2019s chief executive, said that because Peloton\u2019s technology helps drivers get better at doing something they are familiar with, he thinks it can be quickly commercialized.\u201cOur basic approach is let\u2019s bring real value to the fleet and society now,\u201d Mr. Switkes said.Given that trucks are likely to need drivers for some time, it\u2019s no wonder that self-driving companies are almost universally pitching themselves as a friendly partner instead of a job killer. \u201cYou increase productivity, but also make the job more attractive,\u201d Mr. Rodrigues said.And it\u2019s true: Trucking is a brutal job. Drivers endure long, tedious stretches where they are inactive but have to stay focused, and they spend weeks at a time away from home. For those and other reasons, the industry\u2019s biggest problem has been the scarcity and turnover of drivers, making it hard to keep up with shipping demand.\u201cWe see this as a solution to the driver shortage and being able to redeploy them to the jobs they actually want,\u201d said Chris Nordh, senior director of advanced vehicle technologies at Ryder.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that trucking will shed about 300,000 jobs per year \u2014 starting in 25 years. Clearly, that estimate is based on so many ifs that the precise number is not worth fretting over. The bigger point is that as technology gets better, it will start replacing jobs.When Amazon went public in 1997, there wasn\u2019t much worry about huge job losses. Today, online retail companies require about one employee per $1 million of annual sales, versus 3.5 employees per $1 million at physical stores \u2014 a big reason that retail employment is falling by about 100,000 jobs per year, according to the Goldman report.As the saying goes, predictions are hard \u2014 especially about the future. But you can learn a lot by looking at today\u2019s bets. Mr. Fuller, from US Xpress, has a 38-year-old son named Craig.Last year Craig Fuller founded a company called TransRisk, which recently announced a $3.4 million venture capital investment. TransRisk logs millions of transactions and other market data to help trucking companies predict prices along with future supply and demand. Craig Fuller\u2019s bet is that as trucking becomes more automated, trucks will be in motion longer and routed by artificial-intelligence systems.As that happens, he said, the business will be reshuffled. Companies like his father\u2019s \u2014 which exist, more or less, to manage armies of drivers \u2014 will compete with data companies that specialize in managing computers.\u201cWhen you take away the driver and have a business that is completely based on analytics, very few fleets will be able to survive that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m betting on data and information services. He\u2019s betting on owning equipment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Parliament Asks Twitter About Russian Meddling in Brexit Vote", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A British lawmaker said on Friday that some of the same Russian-linked Twitter accounts that sought to influence the American presidential election were also deployed in Britain, in the strongest indication yet that Russia used the same tactics on both sides of the Atlantic.Twitter disclosed to the United States Congress this week that it had identified 2,752 accounts affiliated with Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, a notorious troll factory. In a letter to the company, the lawmaker, Damian Collins, wrote that \u201cit has subsequently emerged that some of those accounts were also posting content that relates to the politics of the United Kingdom.\u201dMr. Collins, a Conservative who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into \u201cfake news,\u201d had been presented with screen shots showing the same Russian-linked accounts posting about Britain, his office said Friday.The Brexit process has tied the Conservative government in knots, with cabinet divisions that have badly weakened Prime Minister Theresa May. Any suspicions about Russian interference in the vote would deepen the troubles Mrs. May already faces in rallying her government around a unified stance over Brexit.Although Twitter reaches a relatively small British audience, Russian efforts to use the platform would suggest that its propagandists were also active on Facebook, which has more users and is much harder for those outside the company to monitor.Asked about the claim that accounts linked to Russia had also posted about Britain, a Twitter spokesman declined to comment. But the spokesman said that Twitter would support government investigations into election interference.Russia is eager to weaken or divide the European Union, which it sees as a threat to its influence in Eastern Europe, so it would not be surprising if it were found to have mounted a campaign in favor of Brexit.Facebook said Russia\u2019s internet Research Agency had posted roughly 80,000 pieces of divisive content that was shown to about 29 million people between January 2015 and August 2017, and those posts were then widely shared and reposted to reach far more. The company said it had deleted more than 170 accounts on its photo-sharing app Instagram that had posted about 120,000 pieces of Russia-linked content.That has raised questions about the possibility that a coordinated \u201cbot army\u201d was deployed, and also about the possibility that Twitter itself may have detected and removed them without disclosing the manipulation. Because creating active Twitter accounts can be costly, owners who use them for campaigns typically prefer not to discard them. A spokesman for Twitter has declined to comment.In his letter, Mr. Collins, the chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, asked Twitter for \u201ca list of accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency and any other Russian linked accounts that it has removed and examples of any posts from these accounts that are linked to the United Kingdom.\u201d Mr. Collins asked the company to provide the information by the end of November.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia Inquiry Fails to Unite a Nation", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorIn a buck-stops-with-us moment, they were resolute about doing better. And they were contrite \u2014 even the Fox News founder and chief executive, Roger Ailes, a famous bully who rarely shied from a fight.\u201cWe let our viewers down,\u201d Mr. Ailes said. \u201cIt will not happen again.\u201dThe networks were on the hot seat because their election-night coverage had contributed to the chaos of that shambolic evening. They declared Al Gore the winner in Florida before all of the state\u2019s polls were closed \u2014 and then they called it for George W. Bush, although the results remained in doubt for weeks.In the months that followed, the news organizations agreed on the basic facts, if not on every detail. And under bipartisan pressure from Congress, they moved swiftly to fix their flawed election-night projection system.Look at us now. As the country grapples with a still more serious affront to American democracy, the agreement on the basic facts in the mainstream news media does not extend to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire and other important parts of the conservative media.This is the case even as the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III bears down in his investigation of the alleged Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election.As Mr. Mueller and his team home in on people connected to President Trump, including his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, the president and his allies in the conservative media sphere are pointing at the Democrats and Hillary Clinton.The opacity of the tech companies was matched by the efforts of some conservative media outlets to confuse and distract.In the days leading up to the indictment of Mr. Manafort and his lobbying partner Rick Gates, they saw fit to question Mr. Mueller\u2019s legitimacy. They did so while arguing that the real focus should be on Mrs. Clinton, the Democrats and a political research firm that commissioned the gathering of information on Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, Fusion GPS.The counternarrative was particularly pronounced in the outlets controlled by Mr. Murdoch \u2014 who has close ties to the president\u2019s family \u2014 and his news and entertainment companies, 21st Century Fox and News Corp.Foreshadowing Mr. Goodwin\u2019s dubious argument was an editorial in the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal, which declared that Mr. Mueller \u201clacks the critical distance\u201d to look into the allegation that \u201cDemocrats paid for Russians to compile wild allegations about a U.S. presidential candidate.\u201d The editorial also questioned whether the dossier had triggered the F.B.I. inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.And while skepticism is a virtue in all journalistic endeavors, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the Democrats hired Fusion GPS with the purpose of getting Russians to spread \u201cwild allegations\u201d about Mr. Trump.As John Sipher, a former Central Intelligence Agency chief of station, pointed out, intelligence tends to come from sources within foreign governments.\u201cReaching out to Russians and Americans to try to collect information on what might have happened and then pass that information to sources in good faith, that\u2019s different from trying to conspire with Russia to get stolen emails from the United States,\u201d Mr. Sipher told me.The collective coverage from The Journal editorial page, The New York Post and Fox News \u2014 not including the straight-ahead coverage by the likes of Shepard Smith and Bret Baier \u2014 was testament to the Murdoch empire\u2019s ability to make its own journalistic weather.Between the promotion of alternative narratives and the way the social media platforms have been so slow in describing their inadvertent hosting of the Russian effort, there\u2019s a striking lack of national unity over what appears to have been a foreign incursion in an American election. So you have to wonder how the country will ever come together to do something about it.\u201cThere\u2019s this epic lack of consensus, or active dis-census,\u201d said Shawn Powers, the executive director of the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, who has spent years studying what he calls the \u201cgeopolitics of information.\u201dMr. Powers was confident that, as the facts come out, the country will find a way to fend off similar attacks. For instance, he said, Facebook, Twitter and Google are adding new policies to combat false information, fake accounts and nefarious foreign political advertising.But I can\u2019t help thinking back to 2001.On Tuesday, I called Tom Johnson, the former CNN chairman, who was one of the executives who appeared on Capitol Hill to testify in 2001. He said some colleagues had some qualms appearing before Congress, given the First Amendment implications. But he told me that he had felt it was the right thing to do.\u201cI still think we have the very highest public responsibility to make sure we get it right and, when we don\u2019t get it right, that we try to determine what went wrong and what we can do about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really gets down to operating in the public interest.\u201dOh, yeah, that.Jaclyn Peiser contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Says It\u2019s Policing Fake Accounts. But They\u2019re Still Easy to Spot.", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Executives of Facebook, Twitter and Google pledged to Congress this week to do more to prevent the fakery that has polluted their sites. \u201cWe understand that the people you represent expect authentic experiences when they come to our platform,\u201d Colin Stretch, the general counsel of Facebook, told the Senate Intelligence Committee. He said the company was doubling its review staff to 20,000 and using artificial intelligence to find more \u201cbad actors.\u201dDespite months of talk about the problem of fraud facing Facebook and other tech companies, and vows to root it out, their sites remain infected by obvious counterfeits. The Russian influence operation during the 2016 election, which occasioned the three congressional hearings this week, is only one especially consequential sample of a far larger problem, in which the platforms are gamed for profit or political influence.Conswriters.com, like hundreds of \u201cclickbait\u201d sites, pastes enticing headlines on articles that read like the work of time-pressed high school students. But it is packed with Google ads that generate revenue for every click, highlighting Google\u2019s foundational role in the ecosystem of online deception.Jonathan L. Zittrain, who studies the internet and society at Harvard, said the companies are reluctant to aggressively purge bogus users and deceptive content because of their business model, which is built on signing up more and more people.\u201cThese platforms are oriented to maximize user growth and retention,\u201d Mr. Zittrain said. \u201cThat means not throwing up even tiny hurdles along the sign-up runway, and not closing accounts without significant cause. I suspect they figure there are enough accounts that are the subject of complaints to review without looking for more to assess.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how sloppy some of these accounts are,\u201d Mr. Elwood said. \u201cI hate liars and I\u2019m drawn to understand stuff like this.\u201d______Red Flags: How to Spot Fake ContentCheck out who a profile is \u201cfriends\u201d with. Is the hometown listed on a profile similar to its friend base? For example, \u201cKeven Eversley\u201d claims to be from Minneapolis, but the majority of his friends are from Skopje, Macedonia.Compare the profile\u2019s public name to its web address. For the Eversley profile, it has a different name in the address: Aleksandar Teovski.If a profile seems suspicious, search for similar pages that draw on the same personal details or images.______\u201cThe reporting process is frustrating,\u201d Mr. Elwood said. \u201cFacebook seems to be lagging way behind the problem.\u201dFacebook estimates that as many as 60 million accounts, 2 to 3 percent of the company\u2019s 2.07 billion regular visitors, are fakes. Sean Edgett, Twitter\u2019s general counsel, testified before Congress that about 5 percent of its 330 million users are \u201cfalse accounts or spam,\u201d which would add up to more than 16 million fakes.\u201cSpammers and bad actors are getting better at making themselves look more real,\u201d Mr. Edgett said.Independent experts say the real numbers are far higher.On Twitter, little more than an email address is needed to start tweeting. Facebook\u2019s requirement that users be their authentic selves means the company asks for a smattering of information to sign up \u2014 name, birthday, gender and email address. But few checks exist to verify that information.\u201cPart of the problem is that Facebook is a black box,\u201d said Michael Serazio, a professor of communications at Boston College. \u201cThey do what they do, and we don\u2019t know to what degree their operations can even handle these issues \u2014 not to mention how handling them maps with their economic model.\u201dIn fact, fighting too hard against deception may clash with the business models that have allowed the companies to thrive. Facebook, Google and Twitter all offer self-serve advertising systems allowing anyone in the world to buy, target and deliver ads for as much \u2014 or as little \u2014 money as they wish to spend. More scrutiny could hamper growth.\u201cProtecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d he said.Whether public concern about the manipulation of the platforms might at some point threaten the business remains to be seen. But many customers who run up against the fakery problem end up unhappy.Kristofer Goldsmith, an assistant director for policy and government relations at Vietnam Veterans of America, noticed last summer a look-alike Facebook page calling itself Vietnam Vets of America that initially borrowed the real group\u2019s logo. Linked to a website hosted in Bulgaria, the upstart page pushed viral content, weighing in on N.F.L. players\u2019 protests of police shootings. It posted looping videos that were months or years old but presented them as breaking news, he said.\u201cSometimes their grammar was off,\u201d Mr. Goldsmith said, but there was no way to know who was behind the page.Soon, the look-alike page had 200,000 followers \u2014 more than the 120,000 than the page of the real group, which has a long history of service, a congressional charter and chapters around the country. Mr. Goldsmith said the linked website had few ads, so he suspected a political motive, probably in line with the Russian campaign to divide Americans.In August, Mr. Goldsmith began complaining to Facebook. But officials there hesitated; hosting pages for millions of groups, they were hardly equipped to assess in detail whether a particular veterans group was worthy and another was not.Finally, in late October, Facebook shut the newer page, deciding it had illicitly stolen the intellectual property of the older page. But Mr. Goldsmith said the experience was disturbing.\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re taking a very proactive approach,\u201d he said of Facebook. \u201cThere was a foreign entity targeting American vets and inserting itself into divisive debates. Someone could do this to us every month.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated at one point Facebook\u2019s most recent report of its monthly average users. The correct number is 2.07 billion, not 2.3 billion. That earlier version also misstated how many users Facebook estimates are fakes. The company estimates that 10 percent of its accounts, or 200 million, are duplicates used by real people, and that 60 million accounts are fake.Lilia Chang contributed to this article.Advertisement"}

The Governors Highway Safety Association say the reason for this spike in pedestrian deaths can be attributed to the rise in smartphone use in America. Pedestrians distracted by a smartphone can take 18% longer to cross the road than an undistracted pedestrian, this little bit of extra time can be the difference between life and death in some cases.I have some personal experience with distracted pedestrians myself. To get to school in morning I have to cross a busy intersection directly in front of my school. Many other kids like myself also take this route and almost everyday I see students distracted by their cell phones walking very slowly and carelessly across the busy road, almost causing an accident or being hit numerous times. Seeing this very real problem so close opens my eyes to just how dangerous a distracted pedestrian can be.I think that texting and walking is just as dangerous as texting and driving. I believe that because when you are texting and walking you are not paying attention to where you are going. You could be texting and walking and walk into the road and make a car swerve to miss you and they could hit someone else or hurt themselves. I think that it should be illegal to text and walk because many people are getting hurt because of it.Honestly, I\u2019m not really sure how I feel about this article. Banning cellphone use while walking could be a huge help and prevent many pedestrian deaths in the United States and around the world... This could also cause a huge backlash. There are so many smartphone users nowadays and even more kids that use devices all the time. Many teenagers and young adults would probably protest against this type of law for a while. Me, being a teenager, wouldn\u2019t really like to see this become a law but at the same time, it could save my life one day. I think Honolulu is on the right track by enforcing a small fine if people are caught looking at their phone while crossing the street. It teaches them a lesson but doesn\u2019t put them in jail, nor break the bank.Others thought a law against texting while walking was unnecessary and would do little to prevent pedestrian deaths.From a young age, we are taught to look both ways before crossing the street. As we get older, it is easy to to start believing that we are invincible. We forget things like this, unwritten rules that have been formed in order to keep everyone safe. I believe that cellphones should not be used when crossing the street, but I don\u2019t believe that it should be illegal. Creating a law that bans looking at your cellphone while crossing the street would be difficult to enforce, and in this day and age it would be broken all the time.Texting while walking across the street should not have to come down to a matter of legality. Texting while walking across the street should be a decision based off of common sense, folks!Let\u2019s be real, we all know that when we\u2019re focused on our phones everything around us is a blur. More often than not our phones take our undivided attention, which can become an especially scary and even deadly situation when combined with the known fact that many drivers are looking at their phones as well. In today\u2019s society we just don\u2019t know when to put the phones down...I am curious to see how other cities around the world will address this issue in the following years, but my hope is that common sense will kick in before kicking the bucket due to distracted walking will.Instead of making it illegal, several students proposed other solutions.I think that walking across the street while texting can be dangerous but i don\u2019t think that there should be a law that stops people from doing it it is their own choice to walk across the road and text. I also think that there are many ways to stop people from doing it we can make apps or at the crossing of every street we can put some kind of device that stops people from texting and crossing the street.Crossing the street especially in a busy city is very dangerous but I wouldn\u2019t rule It Illegal...I think it should be pushed forward and openly approached a lot by different companies and government to uplift a campaign like no texting while crossing or something else so we can at least reduce the numbers of deaths or injuries.Is looking at a text more important, or is your life? The text can wait until you are stopped, the cars most likely won\u2019t. The government probably can\u2019t do much about fixing this other than having police fine the people. An app needs to be created that while you\u2019re walking your phone won\u2019t let you access it. Perhaps at crosswalks when it says you can walk to have a friendly reminder to put your phone downWhen David Canepa said \u201cAs children, we are taught to look both ways when crossing a street, but you can\u2019t look both ways when you\u2019re looking down and texting.\u201d I feel that this message is more pointed towards parents and their children. Because if a parent tells their child to look both ways before crossing the road then right after saying that the parent just blatantly walks across the crosswalk while their eyes are glued to their phone..._________Lulu, my five-pound, cute-as-a-button Yorkie will not wear a bow for more than 60 seconds much less inconvenience herself with a diorama strapped to her back all day whether it\u2019s for the prestigious Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade or not. What a shame too since Lulu could be so many things for an East Village parade that would surely land her on NYT\u2019s top picks given Lulu\u2019s teacup size and abnormal level of cuteness. Hats off to the owners of Harley, Giupetto, Gianna, and Penelope. Lulu does not sit inside NYC sightseeing buses or saltwater aquariums. Lulu would be the one laying on the street on her back getting tummy rubs from complete strangers.Halloween 2014 Lulu did suffer through going as Piglet with me when I was Winnie the Pooh but that was only because the one sweater on earth she will wear just so happened to be identical to Piglet\u2019s. Will she or I dress up this year? Me, yes, but for Lulu, it will depend on if the costume is non-itchy, does not require her to put anything on her head or hinder her in any way from relaxing on the couch. The best pet costume I\u2019ve ever seen was a Yorkie dressed up as Chewbacca. Its hair was slicked back like Chewy\u2019s and everything. I dream of the day Lulu will let me do that to her. A close second would have to be the \u201cWoof on Wall Street\u201d. That\u2019s pretty clever, Finn.This Halloween, I will not be dressing up in any costume because my dressing up days are over. I feel like i\u2019m too old to be dressing up and going trick or treating. People tend to look at older kids that are dressed up as weird and many people believe our generation is all about pranks and parties. So if we come to their door they might automatically assume we are up to no good or ask us \u201cwhy are you guys not at a party or something?\u201d If I had a group of friends that wanted to dress up in masks and go out to a party, that\u2019ll probably be my excuse as to dress up but not this year. Although, I would like to hand out candy to see all the little children dressed in cute costumes and see if i ever dressed as the when I was younger. I also like giving back to the community.I am going to dress up as my favorite football player. His name is Antonio Brown and he is on the Pittsburgh Steelers. They are my favorite team. My dog is going to dress up as a hot dog. It\u2019s a cute costume. The craziest costume is when someone dressed up as Captain Jack Sparrow. He looked exactly like him and I thought it was actually Johnny Depp.We hope you all had a fun Halloween, whatever you did!_________I have a pretty good memory. Whenever I have an important event or important date coming up I usually write them down so that I will remember them. For school I have a planner and I write down when my assignments are due and when there are tests and quizzes. This helps me stay organized and not to forget the little things, that are easily forgotten.I usually remember what I need to know by making stories up in my mind about the topic. In my healthcare class, each semester we learn 350 medical terms. for our mid-term, they are combined to make actual diseases and you have to determine what it means. I make stories with each word and when I see it, it automatically pops up what story I made for the word.Three Easy Ways to Remember. Tip number one write a to-do list of thing you have to get done like grocery shopping items, because we all should agree there are times were we forget what we need to get from grocery stores. Tip number two, put sticky notes on objects around the house on the object you need to take care of soon like the trash or feeding your animal, or even putting it on the front door to see what your supposed to get while you\u2019re out. Tip number three is fun and easy, play games on your phone or any electronic to help strengthen your mind to help remember, and help the thinking part of it too. So these three tips are simple and easy ways to remember what you could forget.The things that made the most sense to me is when they said that you are missing things when you do more than one thing at a time. I remember things that i need to by writing them down on my phone or a piece of paper. If you want to remember things you have to pay attention to that one thing you can\u2019t do mutiple thing at one time because you are bound to forget something or mix it up with something else.When I was in a theater class, I would repeat my lines over and over and that made me able to remember what I was supposed to say. There are times when I am able to remember a memory from when I was really young that were traumatic to me. I also remember things by using my phone and other electronic resources. The \u2018Reminders\u2019 app, that comes on the iPhone, has helped me a lot and has made me much more responsible. If I were to give someone advice on how to improve their memory, I would recommend repetition and either using a planner, calendar, or a reminder app on a phone.Unfortunately, I admit that I solely rely on my phone whenever I have an important task that needs to be completed. I remember when I was in elementary school in the \u201cblackberry age\u201d, and I would write my homework in my agenda. Today, an agenda is a rare sight. I already have a spaced mind as it is and leave so many of my duties undone. It\u2019s causing me to be more reliable on my technology to remind me, instead of using my own brain power.The article mentioned that we have no need to retain information as we can go right to Google for all the answers, and that greatly worries me. If we continue to depend on the internet to feed us information or tell us what we have to accomplish, will we eventually get to a point where we just stop remembering things?_________I am most like a Coyote, they are cunning, not to pretty and jokesters. They know how to use their resources well. I am very resourceful, leave me out in the wilderness for a week with a knife and a bow and arrow, I will survive. I don\u2019t consider my self really pretty, I am average have fat pockets and really don\u2019t care about what I look like. Coyotes can be good jokesters and so can I. Once I start joking I am on a roll. My parents even gave me the nick name Sokopelli. Sokopelli is a mix of my first name Socorro and Kokopelli a trickster god in indigenous culture.I think I am most like a pigeon, because they possess an ability, according to studies, to learn abstract mathematical rules, and are known to make intelligent choices. Plus, they are an animal that is not difficult to find and seems to fit in with its surrounding environment: the city._________My favorite recreational activity is lacrosse. I prefer a recreational activity where I get to go outside and play against others. I love to play lacrosse because it\u2019s taught me a lot as an athlete and as a person. It\u2019s also super competitive which makes it super fun, especially when we win. I\u2019ve also gained a lot of opportunities and met a lot of new people that I wouldn\u2019t have ever met if it wasn\u2019t for lacrosse. Overall, lacrosse is part of who I am.Being on the cross country team shows how a team can be your family. Your speed nor your time matters to others. Its a fantastic sport to do with your friends, to make new friends, and to go through an experience different from no other sport. In cross country, we all root for each other. In addition, it is a great way to stay in shape, or get in shape, and helps you achieve your goals of becoming a runner, or becoming a better one.Crew is a school sport in which teams compete in boat rowing against one another. This is also a fantastic sport in which your team becomes your family. During practices, we build upper body strength, core strength, and cardio. From how it sounds, you will be able to tell that the workouts are not easy. Through the conditioning, big and small, you push one another, similar to cross country. In between the sweat and exhaustion, you have fun encouraging each other to finish strong and in doing your best. This is why I favor these sports. Cross country and crew are team sports that absolutely recommend. If your school or area offers these sports, take advantage and join!Recreational activities are a very fun way to kill free time and meet new people and build relationships. Personally in the spring and fall I play baseball and i get to meet a lot of different people from different teams and new people on the new team i joined this spring and fall. During the winter I like to go to different mountain and snowboard everyplace I can that is local and I meet a lot more people in the winter than over the spring and fall. Sandboarding is something different and I don\u2019t see it a lot but if I ever have the chance to do it I absolutely will try it and I might nail it and do really good fast because I have been snowboarding and skiing since I was 4 years old.My favorite recreational activity is golf. Golf is much more than a game, and it can help you with life skills later on. You can get outside on a beautiful golf course that is out in nature, quiet and non-contact. Golf is also a great sport as it builds trust and honesty while playing others. Sometimes when life gets hectic its always great to get out on the golf course or the driving range and hit a few golf balls, as it is relaxing, and fun at the same time. Golfers are also very mature, and proper, and the clothing is very high end. This reflects golfing values._________I personally believe I have a good balance between social and private time. I can usually notice when I start lacking in social time because I talk too much in ballet class. I am an introvert, which often surprises many, but just like the connection between my social life and misbehavior, if I don\u2019t get enough alone time I get very irritable and sort of depressed. This is a challenge for me, and I struggle in finding an appropriate balance of social and private interactions.My mother is a user of one of those meditation apps mentioned in the article. She insists that all \u201cenergy\u201d from within, whether it\u2019s positive or negative, will reflect back to you, and all things start from within. I have often disagreed with her. I believe happiness can be achieved existentially, maybe not with material things or phones, but personal connections between friends and family. I am not an avid phone or social media user. I simply prefer in person conversations to texting. I\u2019m sure there is a connection with smartphones and social interactions, but it doesn\u2019t only affect teens. As I said with my mom, she actively uses this meditation app and honestly uses social media more than I do. This social problem affects all people who have a phone and replace healthy social reactions with the unhealthy socializing provided by social media. Because it is right at your fingertips, the value of true conversations has diminished and is ruining society.As a college student, the way I spend my time has vastly changed since I was in high school. In high school, I played five different sports and was a member of Model UN and other clubs. I had close friends with whom I would talk to in class and meet after school or practice. I would go to the library and do homework with friends. But now, I find myself alone much more. I eat breakfasts and other meals alone. My homework tends to need more individual focus which demands quiet and solitude so doing homework alone has become the norm. It is harder than I thought it would be to grow and keep relationships when time moves so quickly and a week can involve so many inconsistencies. I try and recognize the benefits of being able to do what I want, when I want but it does become lonely. The appropriate balance is hard to find but I look for ways to be around people more and more.I like being by my selfThe time spent with friends older or younger, you will always remember those times. That time holds a special place in your heart, and when you are with your friends you don\u2019t worry about the struggles of life, you are just enjoying it. Spending time with other people is enough, its more than enough. The people you surround yourself with describes you and how you are, if that was taken away from you, your whole life would be changed. I think that everyone should spend more time socializing, not just in school but also outside of it. Socializing creates bonds with people that will have a place in your heart no matter what, because you spend so much time with them they become like family.I feel that many teenagers don\u2019t physically interact with other people. Usually, when I\u2019m out, and I do see other teenagers together, they are sitting at a table on their phones not even talking to one another. I also think that things like video chat have replaced talking to friends in person. I think that social relationships are important in the development of people and their happiness. I feel that as technology develops and evolves, people begin to interact less and less than each other. People, especially teenagers, no longer value actual human interaction.Throughout my life, I have always been taught to keep a balance of things. Either between school, hobbies, or church. Though, I have never thought about balancing my social life. Now thinking about it, yes, I have been able to balance my social life between being alone and socializing with others.I am able to socialize with others through school, church and at home. I like communicating with others. I try to talk and hang out with people most of the time, but I feel like there are a few factors that hold me back. Schoolwork is my main factor that affects my social life; I spend the majority of time working on assigned homework. If the amount of assigned homework decreased by half, my amount of socializing would increase tremendously....Now since we live in a world full of advanced technology, our mind sets have changed from face to face talk to face to phone entertainment. Personally, I am not the kind of person that is \u201cmarried\u201d to my phone. Socializing improves mental health. Try it, it works!I feel like the amount of time I spend with my friends is very little if not at all. Whenever I get to see them in person it is always at school and we never have much time to socialize. I feel like myself and others should spend actual face to face time with each other. This will help us get off of our electronics and experience the real world. No good memory has ever come from two people texting one another over instant message._________There\u2019s a house that\u2019s unlike any other house in the neighborhood. It\u2019s a tall, spiraling cylinder of a house. Inside lives an old couple. Every morning they sit on their porch, enjoying a nice cup of coffee and the newspaper. Every morning their neighbor greets them and they have a nice little chat. But one morning, the couple wasn\u2019t out on their porch. The neighbor noticed, but thought that it might have just been something for that one day. But it wasn\u2019t. For the next week, the couple wasn\u2019t one their front porch. Finally, the neighbor knocked on their front door to see what was going on. No answer. The neighbor decided to call the police.Two policemen arrived. They searched the entire house but couldn\u2019t find anything. One policeman thought that the bathroom was suspicious, so he stayed behind. The other policeman went down to the neighbor to talk. Suddenly, there was a loud scream from inside the house. The policeman ran up into the bathroom, and when he got there, found a bloody handprint on the shower curtain.The scariest story i\u2019ve ever heard was told to me at a beautiful place called Camp Waziyatah, It was my third year there and that year I had stayed 6 weeks. First session through half of second session. The story was called the Emily story, it was about this girl named emily and back when the camp used to be an all girls camp they would have dances with the all boys camp across the lake. She met this boy and really liked him, he really liked her. The guy and her decided that they would meet in the middle of the lake, he would bring a boat. She would swim, When it came the time to meet which was 12pm. She got up, put her bathing suit on and put red lipstick on and kissed the corner of the mirror and headed off. She swam to the middle and treaded water for about an hour, she got scared he didn\u2019t arrive so she decided to turn around. By that time fog and settled in while she was swimming and little did she know she was swimming the length of the lake, which was a 3 mile swim and she was a tiny girl. She soon got tired and drowned, in the morning they looked for her and eventually found her body drifting in the lake. Later in the day they also found out the boy had been caught by his friends and not allowed to go. They say that every night when the clock hits 12, if you look in the mirror that Emily had kissed a kiss mark will appear in the corner and the reflection staring back at you...Wouldn\u2019t be yours.The scariest story I\u2019ve ever heard is the myth of the filipino Tik-Tik,or Manananggal. These creatures take the form of a beautiful woman with bat wings.They\u2019re lower body roots to the ground while the torso flies away in search of human blood. To keep them away you have to put salt or garlic in your window;they are like the western vampire in that sense. The only way to kill it is to find the lower body and sprinkle either salt or ashes on the open area.That keeps it from reattaching to to the upper body.What makes them especially scary is that they are tricksters.They confuse they\u2019re prey with the sound that they make.The farther away they sound,the closer they are to you.A group of college students was hanging out in Susy\u2019s one night when the phone rang. \u201cHello?\u201d Susy asked.\u201cThis is the viper. Be ready\u201d She hung up and went back to her friends.A half-hour later, the phone rang again. \u201cHe- Hello?\u201d She asked\u201cIt\u2019s the viper. I\u2019m five minutes away\u201dShe hung up. She didn\u2019t know what to do. She rushed her friends out and locked the door. The phone rang once more. \u201cI\u2019m walking down the hall now-\u201d The phone hung up. She stood by the door looking through the peephole. She heard footsteps and hid behind the couch.\u201cOpen up!\u201d a man called out \u201cI am the viper and I am here to vipe your vindows!\u201dEven more frightening were some of the real-life encounters with the supernatural readers shared.I believe in ghost because I have experienced a few things. My parents tell me this story all the time, when I was younger (just turned 2) my dad was giving me a bath before bed and he said that I pointed behind him (there was nothing behind him but a closed door) and kept saying different body parts, my dad thinks that I was seeing different parts of something, my dad though it was extra creepy because I was barely talking yet. Another encounter I\u2019ve had was when my dad\u2019s friend had just passed away and one night I was laying in the bed with my best friend and the end of the bed starting going down in one area and made a creaking noise, me and my friend said the only explanation was that someone was sitting down at the end of the bed.I\u2019m not quite sure what the scariest story that I\u2019ve heard is because I\u2019ve heard a lot of them, I do believe that ghost exists lived in a lot of haunted houses in the past and I\u2019ve heard and seen some terrifying stuff. when I was about 7 years old I lived in a very old house that hadn\u2019t been lived in for years, there were 3 rooms and my sister and I shared one. the room only had three walls though where the fourth wall should have been was the staircase to come upstairs, one night and my sister and laid in bed for some reason I just couldn\u2019t go to sleep the night seemed so long. I looked around the room out of boredom as I looked something caught my eye by the stairs I focused my eyes really hard to try to see what it was,I swear when I saw this shadow crawling up the stairs I felt my heart drop I hid under the blanket hoping that when I came out it would be gone, I was so terrified I couldn\u2019t believe it. I nudged my sister to wake her up but, she was already awake, she asked me if I had just seen that black thing crawling up the stairs. As we uncovered our faces to see if it was gone we both saw the black shadow sitting at the desk we had in the corner of the room. Honestly, that was so scary for me and probably for my sister too, you may not believe it but it was a true story.One day, when my brother and I were home alone after school, so we decided to play some video games and eat snacks instead of our homework. Our mom wasn\u2019t coming home for at least two hours. Caught up in our Mario Kart game, we couldn\u2019t happen but to hear loud banging on our garage door, the room just off where we were. It sounded like an angry serial killer was banging to see if anyone was home. We knew we closed the garage doors, so how did he get in?The door to the house was locked too. I started to quietly cry, and my brother panicking, told me to get the two biggest knifes out of the kitchen drawers. Agreeing, I did as I was told, and my brother dialed my mom. She picked up and told us to call the police if we hear anything else and to go up into a locked room upstairs. We scurried upstairs and stayed there until mom got home. When she opened the door to the house, she was laughing hysterically. I was so confused, what is so funny about your children potentially dying? She then told us to come back downstairs and to look in the garage. There we found that six or seven soda cans had fallen onto the floor, making a loud bang that we thought was someone trying to break in. That was the scariest thing I have ever experienced.Advertisement"}

The interior, which Binford also designed, has already been removed.\u201cSave Chelsea would very much like to see the mural saved and protected,\u201d said Laurence Frommer, one of the group\u2019s leaders. \u201cAnd we would, of course, like it to be done in the proper way.\u201dThe property\u2019s developer, Gemini Rosemont, is open to preserving the mural but has not yet committed to doing so.\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough information to make any decisions at this point,\u201d said Brian Ferrier, Gemini Rosemont\u2019s vice president of development. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in the community\u2019s thoughts about this, and we\u2019re going down the road to find a solution.\u201d He added that the new building is still being designed, and no date has been set for demolishing the supporting walls on which the mural hangs.The mural is painted on canvas, not plaster, which significantly eases the burden of preservation. The developer contacted several galleries to determine its value and see if there was any interest in the work. Mr. Ferrier says that they did not receive any positive responses. \u201cIt was kind of crickets.\u201dJamestown, the real estate company that owns the neighborhood\u2019s Chelsea Market, expressed interest in helping to preserve the mural after being contacted by a representative of Save Chelsea. On Tuesday, Erik Bottcher, Mr. Johnson\u2019s chief of staff, said that Google had contacted his office to say it would like to play a role in protecting Binford\u2019s painting.Local leaders were alerted to the existence of the mural by Andrew Cronson, a junior at New York University, in October. \u201cI walked by this sort of mundane bank on the corner of 6th Avenue, and its ghostly presence struck me,\u201d he said of mural. When he returned to the building and saw demolition permits posted there, he contacted several local preservationist groups, and Save Chelsea answered the call.The painting\u2019s subject is the intersection of 14th Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan as it might have looked at the end of the 1800s. Horse-drawn carriages compete with women carrying parasols for the right of way. Commuters climb the stairs to the aboveground train, and crowds congregate on sidewalks where vendors hawk their wares. A marching band on parade startles a horse and what appears to be a young couple strolls, oblivious to the commotion surrounding them.Though Binford, who died in 1997, is not well known, \u201cA Memory of 14th Street and 6th Avenue\u201d is connected to an important tradition of America painting, Jon Ritter, a professor of architecture and urbanism at N.Y.U., explained in a phone interview. Binford had painted a government-commissioned mural for a Mississippi post office in 1939, and Professor Ritter noted the Chelsea mural\u2019s aesthetic kinship with the government-funded large-scale works of the Great Depression. The painting, he said, also bears the influence of Mexican muralists like Diego Rivera and of European Cubists like Picasso and Braque.\u201cIt\u2019s clearly not a linear picture of a single moment of time on this street,\u201d Professor Ritter said. \u201cHe\u2019s using a radically distorted or fragmented approach to storytelling to show a number of different scenes at once. The idea of Cubism was to represent multiple time sequences on one single canvas.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alarming when something so special comes close to being demolished,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote by email. \u201cBinford\u2019s mural is a window into our neighborhood\u2019s history. I\u2019m hopeful that the building owners will save the mural. If they don\u2019t, I hope we can find someone who can.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Part of my job is to help keep her relevant to the world of the living.I land somewhere between those two groups. I\u2019m 32, and I\u2019m neither a kid nor a parent. I try to strike a balance. I want my stories to be accessible to my most dedicated reader \u2014 my 89-year-old grandfather (Hi, Grandpa Jack!) \u2014 without turning away a 19-year-old reader who has never thought of The New York Times as a publication that\u2019s particularly relevant to her. (Maybe because The Times has not always thought much about catering to her interests.)Now that I\u2019m here, I find that seemingly tiny details and tonal choices can have a big impact over how a story is perceived. There may yet be Times readers out there, for instance, who don\u2019t know what #TBT stands for, and lack the internet-native reflex to just Google it. But if I explain what #TBT means in a piece, internet-savvy readers will see it as a big flashing sign that says: \u201cTHIS COLUMN ISN\u2019T FOR YOU.\u201d So I leave it be.Our working tagline, \u201cEverything weird, wrong, and totally sad about internet culture,\u201d partly reflects my pessimistic mood about the internet lately, but also signals our interest in conflict and argument.The best and scariest part of it is that this is all really new for The Times, and for me, too.

While the voice-over lays out an argumentative essay about the internet, the visuals situate the viewer in a place and time and layer in inside jokes and references.Whether we\u2019re trying to shine light on some obscure corner of the internet, or to reframe a familiar one through a new perspective, it\u2019s a revelation and a relief to be able to show rather than tell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Hits a Nerve, Eliciting Intense Reactions", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It usually doesn\u2019t take much to get people on the internet worked up. To get them really worked up, make the topic internet regulation.In some cases, views on the sweeping change, which would repeal landmark regulations meant to ensure an open internet, have turned into personal attacks. The agency\u2019s chairman, Ajit Pai, said threatening calls and emails had poured into his home and his wife\u2019s work. An image of a protest poster with his children\u2019s names was posted online and spread widely. Ethnic slurs aimed at Mr. Pai, whose parents immigrated from India, littered his Twitter feed.And at least 400,000 comments about the issue since April on the F.C.C. site appear to have originated from an apartment in St. Petersburg, Russia, the agency said. It is unclear whether the emails did originate from there, or were made to look as if they did.But none of that has overshadowed the heated reaction to the agency\u2019s proposal.\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be middle ground on this issue,\u201d said John Beahn, a lawyer at Skadden Arps who specializes in regulation.But Mr. Pai, a Republican nominated for the chairmanship by President Trump, said the regulations were heavy-handed and prevented telecom companies from pursuing new business models. His proposal, by stripping away the existing rules, would allow telecom companies to charge websites to deliver their data at higher speeds.\u201cI\u2019d like to cut through hysteria and hot air and speak in plain terms about the plan,\u201d Mr. Pai said, adding that the plan would bring back the regulation-free policy that helped the internet thrive. He said big tech companies might be a bigger threat to online speech than telecom companies.The proposal is expected to be approved at a meeting of the five F.C.C. commissioners on Dec. 14. The two other Republican commissioners have already expressed their support for Mr. Pai.Big web companies like Google and Netflix played activist roles as well, supporting the stronger rules. They argued that telecom companies should not be able to split sites into fast lanes and slow lanes, because that would allow them to become a sort of gatekeeper for information and entertainment. In addition, they say, it would hurt start-ups without the money to pay for the faster lanes.Mr. Pai, who opposed the rules as a commissioner in 2015, gave broad outlines of his plans early this year. For months, comments to the F.C.C. website piled up, to more than 20 million. President Barack Obama\u2019s clean power plan, perhaps his biggest policy change at the Environmental Protection Agency, attracted 4.3 million comments over six months.But the intensity has increased even more since Mr. Pai released the details of the proposal \u2014 perhaps in part because few people expected him to try to strip all of the existing rules.\u201cWhat the tech bloggers and the left don\u2019t like is that there are options and that there is a freedom in the marketplace and that people can choose superior service if they\u2019re willing to pay for it,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said. \u201cAnd if somebody\u2019s willing to pay for superior service, the providers had better provide it.\u201dPublic interest groups like Free Press and organizations like Mozilla, the nonprofit behind the popular Firefox browser, said they were prepared to file suit against the plan as soon as the vote on Dec. 14.\u201cThe action hit a nerve because the internet is central to the vast majority of people\u2019s daily lives, and so people were very eager to understand what was happening over the weekend,\u201d said Denelle Dixon, chief legal officer for Mozilla.The reaction from the biggest tech companies, however, has been noticeably subdued. Instead of forceful pleas from their executives, like those in years past on this issue, they are largely speaking through their trade group, the Internet Association, which has expressed disappointment over Mr. Pai\u2019s plan.\u201cInternet companies are firm supporters of the 2015 Open Internet Order and will continue our push for strong, enforceable net neutrality rules going forward,\u201d said Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association. \u201cWe are reviewing the draft order and weighing our legal options.\u201dTaking their place are start-ups such as Airbnb, Twitter and Reddit, which joined dozens of smaller start-ups on Monday warning Mr. Pai that the rules would hurt innovation and the economy.Sorting out the real individual commenters from fake or automated accounts is far more tricky. The F.C.C. said it did not have the resources to investigate every comment on its site.Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said that after a six-month investigation, his office had found that the identities of tens of thousands of state residents were fraudulently used to post comments to the F.C.C.\u201cIf law enforcement can\u2019t investigate and (where appropriate) prosecute when it happens on this scale,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said, \u201cthe door is open for it to happen again and again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

An analyst at Goldman Sachs just published a research note putting the odds of Republicans changing the tax code at more than 80 percent. But Republicans in the Senate have added a wrinkle: repealing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate at the same time. More on that in a moment.Remember that a White House spokesman previously told the NYT, \u201cThe President did not speak with the Attorney General about this matter, and no White House official was authorized to speak with the Department of Justice on this matter.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London.____________________________From a note just published by Alec Phillips, a political economist at the firm:The tax reform debate is moving forward faster than we or most other observers expected. While there are a number of issues that could still slow it down, or stop it altogether, we believe the odds that tax reform will be enacted by early 2018 \u2014 already our base case \u2014 have risen to 80% (from 65% previously).He added that there\u2019s a one-in-three chance of a tax change becoming law by the end of the year, though the House and Senate may need time to reconcile their bills.While Mr. Phillips thinks that Republicans\u2019 tax efforts still face obstacles, including intense lobbying efforts and questions about whether the Senate can pass its bill, he believes that the overall campaign will succeed.Among some of Mr. Phillips\u2019 other predictions:\u2022 The corporate tax rate appears likely to go down to 20 percent, but may need to be phased in.\u2022 Limits on deductions for corporate interest payments should follow the more lenient prescription set out in the House bill.\u2022 Fewer Republicans than expected will ultimately push back against limits on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT in Congressional parlance.\u2014 MichaelSenator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, had pushed for the mandate to be eliminated as part of the tax bill. Here\u2019s what he had to say:\u201cRepealing the mandate pays for more tax cuts for working families and protects them from being fined by the I.R.S. for not being able to afford insurance that Obamacare made unaffordable in the first place.\u201dMr. El-Erian has the qualifications: former C.E.O. of Pimco, currently chief economic adviser at Allianz. But he\u2019s also what some of President Trump\u2019s backers would consider a \u201cglobalist,\u201d from his international upbringing as the son of an Egyptian diplomat to his economic views, which generally mesh well with the departing Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen.President Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve is a very wise decision that will be welcomed by markets. It brings a highly respected, well-informed and experienced professional to the helm of the world\u2019s most powerful central bank.\u2014 MichaelThe S.E.C. filed a total of 62 new enforcement actions against public companies and their subsidiaries in the fiscal year, down from 92 the previous fiscal year.Of the 62 actions, only 17 were brought in the second half of the year.Trian Partners probably wishes you didn\u2019t.At the time Trian published its analysis, G.E. was trading at $25.47. It predicted that by around this time, the conglomerate could get up to $40 to $45 a share. (To be fair, the activist had a laundry list of recommendations that G.E. follow, and the company hasn\u2019t implemented all of them. Who knows whether sticking to Trian\u2019s plan would have avoided this?)As of early this afternoon, the company\u2019s stock price was at $17.50, down 8 percent for the day.\u2014 MichaelSome start-up employees could owe big tax bills without being able to pay, since privately held companies\u2019 shares are generally harder to sell. Bigger unicorns could draw money from outside investors to let employees cash out \u2014 Uber already has \u2014 but younger start-ups have no such recourse.Companies could pay more cash compensation, using up precious cash flow. Or they could go public \u2014 if they make it that far. Tech employees might forgo working at younger companies because they couldn\u2019t pay as much. \u201cWe legitimately can\u2019t figure out how this is going to work,\u201d one start-up adviser told DealBook\u2019s Michael J. de la Merced.\u201cIt would mean that I would have to sell the company,\u201d said Shoaib Makani, founder and chief executive of long-haul trucking start-up KeepTruckin. \u201cI have zero net worth aside from the common stock I hold in the company. It would be impossible. I would be in default.\u201dTying into themes touched on in our conference last week, here are some of the ways businesses are trying to future-proof themselves:Just look at G.E.\u2019s stock performance yesterday, after the company unveiled its big turnaround plan and dividend cut:\u201cIf that is all you were going to say, why did we have to wait from July until November?\u201dCritics\u2019 corner\u201cI think that every major technology company has to be concerned right now. We\u2019ve reached a tipping point,\u201d Kelly Dermody, a lawyer who is working on the cases against Microsoft and Google, told me.In other sexual harassment newsAmazon and other U.S. companies here, including Apple Inc., have faced increased pressure in recent months in the face of the Chinese government\u2019s desire to control cyberspace.

China\u2019s push to become a major player in electric cars is already shaking up the global auto industry. California\u2019s governor is hoping it will also give the state an advantage in its continuing showdown with Detroit over battery-powered vehicles.Gov. Jerry Brown said on Wednesday evening at an event in San Francisco that China\u2019s electric-car effort would help California withstand demands from American automakers that the state ease back on its effort to put more clean-burning vehicles on the road. California mandates that manufacturers sell a small but growing percentage of electric cars or plug-in hybrid vehicles, which run on both gasoline and electricity.Detroit says the mandate is technologically infeasible.\u201cEven now, some of the automobile companies are trying to come out and say \u2018Gee, the standards in a few years will be too tough,\u2019\u201d Governor Brown said. \u201c\u2018Will you let us off the hook?\u2019\u201dBut speaking at the The New York Times\u2019s Climate Tech conference, Governor Brown said China\u2019s push puts pressure on Detroit\u2019s automakers to more quickly embrace electric cars or be overwhelmed by the competition.\u201cWe have an ace card called China\u201d in the dispute, he said.California is the largest market for electric cars in the United States, and the world\u2019s second-largest after China.The Trump administration has begun moving to weaken overall fuel-economy standards in the United States. Still, Governor Brown said, California and China together are such an important part of global car sales that they represent \u201ctwo formidable domains that even Mr. Trump can\u2019t overcome.\u201dThe Chinese government said in September that it would phase out the sale of cars with internal combustion engines, a goal that Britain, France, India and Norway have already announced. Li Junfeng, a key architect of China\u2019s energy policies and senior adviser, said on the conference sidelines that China had not yet picked a year for the phaseout to be completed.Still, he added, \u201cI think China will be earlier than other countries.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)There is good news and bad news for California homeowners, says Ken Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business.Home prices, he predicts as part of his annual forecast, are not due for a crash.One wild card is the Republican tax plan.Professor Rosen calculates that if state and local income tax deductions are eliminated California taxpayers could be paying $38 billion more, a 2 percent to 3 percent reduction in the state\u2019s economy.\u201cOne-third of people in California are going to face a tax increase that\u2019s going to be quite substantial,\u201d Professor Rosen said.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "She Warned of \u2018Peer-to-Peer Misinformation.\u2019 Congress Listened.", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Before the sun came up on Oct. 31, Renee DiResta sat in bed in her pajamas and logged into a virtual war room.Ms. DiResta knew the lines of questioning inside and out. Along with a handful of people with a similarly obsessive interest in mapping data across social media, she had helped prepare congressional staff members ahead of the hearings. That morning, they gathered in a dedicated channel on the Slack messaging app to watch and listen for answers to questions they had been asking for years.\u201cWe were monitoring closely to see when the companies gave misleading or partial answers so that we could follow up,\u201d said Ms. DiResta, 36, who became immersed in disinformation campaigns in her spare time outside of her job as a founder and head of marketing at Haven, a shipping technology company.How a small group of self-made experts came to advise Congress on disinformation campaigns is a testament to just how long tech companies have failed to find a solution to the problem. For years, the informal group \u2014 about a dozen or so people \u2014 have meticulously logged data and published reports on how easy it was to manipulate social media platforms.In 2016, they monitored thousands of Twitter accounts that suddenly started using bots, or automated accounts, to spread salacious stories about the Clinton family. They watched as multiple Facebook pages, appearing out of nowhere, organized to simultaneously create anti-immigrant events. Nearly all of those watching were hobbyists, logging countless hours outside their day jobs.Senate and House staff members, who knew of Ms. DiResta\u2019s expertise through her public reports and her previous work advising the Obama administration on disinformation campaigns, had contacted her and others to help them prepare for the hearings.Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement that researchers like Ms. DiResta had shown real insight into the platforms, \u201cin many cases, despite efforts by some of the platforms to undermine their research.\u201d Mr. Warner is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.One crucial line of the questioning \u2014 on how much influence Russian-bought advertisements and content had on users \u2014 was the result of work by Ms. DiResta and others with a Facebook-owned tool. \u201cFacebook has the tools to monitor how far this content is spreading,\u201d Ms. DiResta said. \u201cThe numbers they were originally providing were trying to minimize it.\u201dMs. DiResta contended that that is still just the tip of the iceberg. Minimizing the scope of the problem was \u201ca na\u00efve form of damage control,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about punishing Facebook or Twitter. This is us saying, this is important and we can do better.\u201dIn response, Facebook said it had begun organizing academic discussions on disinformation.\u201cWe regularly engage with dozens of sociologists, political scientists, data scientists and communications scholars, and we both read and incorporate their findings into our work,\u201d said Jay Nancarrow, a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe value the work of researchers, and we are going to continue to work with them closely.\u201dA graduate of Stony Brook University in New York, Ms. DiResta wrote her college thesis on propaganda in the 2004 Russian elections. She then spent seven years on Wall Street as a trader, watching the slow introduction of automation into the market. She recalled the initial fear of overreliance on algorithms, as there were \u201cbad actors who could come in and manipulate the system into making bad trades.\u201d\u201cI look at that now and I see a lot of parallels to today, especially for the need for nuance in technological transformations,\u201d Ms. DiResta said. \u201cJust like technology is never leaving Wall Street, social media companies are not leaving our society.\u201dMs. DiResta moved to San Francisco in 2011 for a job with the O\u2019Reilly Alpha Tech Venture Capital firm. But it wasn\u2019t until the birth of her first child a few years later, that Ms. DiResta started to examine the dark side of social media.\u201cWhen my son was born, I began looking into vaccines. I found myself wondering about the clustering effects where the anti-vaccine movement was concentrated,\u201d Ms. DiResta recalled. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018What on earth is going on here? Why is this movement gaining so much momentum here?\u2019\u201dShe started tracking posts made by anti-vaccine accounts on Facebook and mapping the data. What she discovered, she said, was that Facebook\u2019s platform was tailor-made for a small group of vocal people to amplify their voices, especially if their views veered toward the conspiratorial.\u201cIt was this great case study in peer-to-peer misinformation,\u201d Ms. DiResta said. Through one account she created to monitor anti-vaccine groups on Facebook, she quickly realized she was being pushed toward other anti-vaccine accounts, creating an echo chamber in which it appeared that viewpoints like \u201cvaccines cause autism\u201d were the majority.Soon, her Facebook account began promoting content to her on a range of other conspiratorial ideas, ranging from people who claim the earth is flat to those who believe that \u201cchem trails,\u201d or trails left in the sky by planes, were spraying chemical agents on an unsuspecting public.\u201cSo by Facebook suggesting all these accounts, they were essentially creating this vortex in which conspiratorial ideas can just breed and multiply,\u201d Ms. DiResta said.She recalled a meeting with tech companies at the White House in February 2016 where executives, policy leaders and administration officials were told that American-made social media platforms were key to the dissemination of propaganda by ISIS.\u201cWe kept saying this was not a one-off. This was a toolbox anyone can use,\u201d Ms. DiResta said. \u201cWe told the tech companies that they had created a mass way to reach Americans.\u201dA year and a half later, they hope everyone is finally listening. \u201cI think we are at this real moment, where as a society we are asking how much responsibility these companies have toward ensuring that their platforms aren\u2019t being gamed, and that we, as their users, aren\u2019t being pushed toward disinformation,\u201d Ms. DiResta said.Follow Sheera Frenkel on Twitter: @sheerafAdvertisement"}

They had long argued that they were merely neutral platforms with no responsibility for what users posted.But they were quick to remove copyrighted material, child pornography and beheading videos, for example, which posed an obvious threat to their business. They have slowly stepped up the removal of extremist content, spurred on after 2014 by the Islamic State\u2019s use of Twitter to recruit fighters.Most recently, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube all admitted that the Russian government had used their platforms last year to pose as American voters and spread divisive propaganda. Under fire from Congress, all the companies pledged to police their sites more carefully in the future.Born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents, Mr. Awlaki spent half his life in the United States and spoke excellent English. As a popular young imam in Denver, San Diego and a Washington, D.C., suburb, he recorded lecture series that were eventually best sellers among Western Muslims \u2014 notably his 53-CD boxed set on the life of the Prophet Muhammad.Mr. Awlaki and three other members of Al Qaeda were killed in a drone strike in Yemen in September 2011. But his death on Mr. Obama\u2019s orders made him a martyr in the eyes of many admirers, who posted more and more of his work on YouTube.As pressure mounted, however, the company recently decided to treat Mr. Awlaki the way it treats terrorist organizations, with a near-total ban, according to company officials. The officials agreed to discuss the policy change but declined to be named, citing security concerns.YouTube said the initial decision to purge any particular video was made by human reviewers. But once the decision has been made, a \u201chash function,\u201d a kind of digital fingerprint, is created to automatically rid the site of additional copies of the same video.The officials noted that YouTube, according to its published rules, \u201cstrictly prohibits content intended to recruit for terrorist organizations, incite violence, celebrate terrorist attacks or otherwise promote acts of terrorism.\u201d But they decided that in the special case of Mr. Awlaki, all of his recordings should be removed.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a major drop-off of his work on YouTube,\u201d said Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, the research director at George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism and author of a forthcoming book on Mr. Awlaki. \u201cThey deserve credit for that.\u201dSome civil libertarians cautioned about the dangers of censorship, even by a company rather than a government.\u201cThe motivations that lead any individual to commit an act of violence are very complex,\u201d said Faiza Patel of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school. \u201cTo pin it on one guy\u2019s videos seems very simplistic.\u201dMr. Meleagrou-Hitchens noted that Mr. Awlaki\u2019s work remains easy to find elsewhere on the web for those seeking it. A weekend search for Mr. Awlaki\u2019s \u201cCall to Jihad,\u201d for instance, instantly brought up the video on a French site, Dailymotion; on the Internet Archive; and on a Pakistani\u2019s Facebook page.Nonetheless, Mr. Meleagrou-Hitchens said, the popularity of YouTube and its automated recommendations have made it an especially pernicious platform for the cleric.\u201cThe fact is that if you really want Awlaki videos, you\u2019ll find them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if he\u2019s less available on YouTube, fewer people are coming across him who aren\u2019t actually seeking him out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Floating Cities, No Longer Science Fiction, Begin to Take Shape", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is an idea at once audacious and simplistic, a seeming impossibility that is now technologically within reach: cities floating in international waters \u2014 independent, self-sustaining nation-states at sea.Long the stuff of science fiction, so-called \u201cseasteading\u201d has in recent years matured from pure fantasy into something approaching reality, and there are now companies, academics, architects and even a government working together on a prototype by 2020.And yet in 2017, with sea levels rising because of climate change and established political orders around the world teetering under the strains of populism, seasteading can seem not just practical, but downright appealing.\u201cIf you could have a floating city, it would essentially be a start-up country,\u201d said Joe Quirk, president of the Seasteading Institute. \u201cWe can create a huge diversity of governments for a huge diversity of people.\u201dBut over the years, the core idea behind seasteading \u2014 that a floating city in international waters might give people a chance to redesign society and government \u2014 steadily attracted more adherents. In 2011, Mr. Quirk, an author, was at Burning Man when he first heard about seasteading. He was intrigued by the idea and spent the next year learning about the concept.For Mr. Quirk, Burning Man, where innovators gather, was not just his introduction to seasteading. It was a model for the kind of society that seasteading might enable. \u201cAnyone who goes to Burning Man multiple times become fascinated by the way that rules don\u2019t observe their usual parameters,\u201d he said.Seasteading is more than a fanciful hobby to Mr. Quirk and others involved in the effort. It is, in their minds, an opportunity to rewrite the rules that govern society. \u201cGovernments just don\u2019t get better,\u201d Mr. Quirk said. \u201cThey\u2019re stuck in previous centuries. That\u2019s because land incentivizes a violent monopoly to control it.\u201dNo land, no more conflict, the thinking goes.Even if the Seasteading Institute is able to start a handful of sustainable structures, there\u2019s no guarantee that a utopian community will flourish. People fight about much more than land, of course, and pirates have emerged as a menace in certain regions. And though maritime law suggests that seasteading may have a sound legal basis, it is impossible to know how real governments might respond to new neighbors floating offshore.Mr. Quirk and his collaborators created a new company, Blue Frontiers, which will build and operate the floating islands in French Polynesia. The goal is to build about a dozen structures by 2020, including homes, hotels, offices and restaurants, at a cost of about $60 million. To fund the construction, the team is working on an initial coin offering. If all goes as planned, the structures will feature living roofs, use local wood, bamboo and coconut fiber, and recycled metal and plastic.\u201cI want to see floating cities by 2050, thousands of them hopefully, each of them offering different ways of governance,\u201d Mr. Quirk said. \u201cThe more people moving among them, the more choices we\u2019ll have and the more likely it is we can have peace, prosperity and innovation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia Investigation Has Tech Giants Shying From \u2018Social\u2019 Label", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After years of trying unsuccessfully to build a social network to rival Facebook, Google finally got something out of all of its failures: cover.Tech companies have taken a pounding in the court of public opinion in recent months. In the eyes of their critics, they have become too big, too powerful and too unmindful of their influence. And this week\u2019s congressional hearings cast added and unflattering light on the industry\u2019s growing embarrassment over the Russian election meddling.\u201cWithout sufficient oversight, these companies never imagined hostile intelligence services would misuse their platforms in this way,\u201d said Renee DiResta, an independent security researcher at Data for Democracy. \u201cThe people running it appear to not fully appreciate what they\u2019ve designed.\u201dNot surprisingly, perhaps, a few of the industry\u2019s biggest companies have been happy to say, in essence, don\u2019t blame us.Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive and an outspoken critic of the data-collection practices of his company\u2019s technological rivals, said Wednesday that he was concerned that social networks could be weaponized against the people who use them.With the emergence of Facebook, Twitter and their ilk over the last decade, \u201csocial\u201d became a key Silicon Valley buzzword as companies crammed social network-like features into new products. Even Apple, despite the tens of billions of dollars it has earned making computing devices, has tried its hand at a social network focused on music.But as social media has become increasingly connected to unpleasant bickering, race-baiting and Russian propaganda, the must-have \u201csocial\u201d label has become an albatross, said Joseph Bayer, an assistant professor at Ohio State University who focuses on social networks.\u201cThe mere fact that a tech company is trying to minimize its overall influence is a telling signal of the moment we\u2019re in,\u201d said Mr. Bayer.Google, which operates under the parent company Alphabet, can offer a distinction between its business and how social networks operate \u2014 largely because its attempts to build a social network have not been very successful.The company spent millions of dollars creating Google+, a social site built specifically to take on Facebook. The company tied Google+ into nearly every one of its properties, describing it as the \u201csocial spine\u201d of Google in public statements at the time.There also were short-lived efforts like Google Buzz and Google Wave, or geographically specific sites like Orkut \u2014 popular in Brazil but ignored elsewhere.Google+ continues to exist but it is considered a disappointment. Google said it had found no political posts from state-linked actors on Google+.Google said accounts believed to have ties to the Kremlin had uploaded more than 1,100 videos to YouTube on racial, religious and political topics. Those videos were viewed 309,000 times. Many of those videos had only a small number of views, though they were \u201cfrequently posted to other social media platforms,\u201d Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s senior counsel in law enforcement and information security, told a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday.Facebook, to offer a comparison, estimated that 150 million users of Facebook and its subsidiary, Instagram, had been exposed to 80,000 posts that came from the Russian influence campaign.Twitter said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts that were linked to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, a company tied to the Kremlin, between September 2016 and November 2016. Those accounts posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period. Twitter identified an additional 36,000 automated accounts that had posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that same period. The tweets received about 288 million views.\u201cNow you\u2019re seeing all the attention from Congress go to Facebook and Twitter, because they\u2019re the linchpin\u201d of the Russian information operations, said Ms. DiResta, the security researcher.In his testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, sought to draw a bright line separating his company\u2019s services from social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which has been an occasional subject of Google acquisition rumors.He also played down what Google knows about its users, a surprising conceit for a company that makes more money than anybody from selling advertising based on the online interests of users.\u201cWe\u2019re somewhat differently positioned because we\u2019re not primarily a social network,\u201d Mr. Walker said in response to a question regarding whether Google should notify users who are exposed to propaganda or divisive content from a foreign government. \u201cMany users are not logged in when they access content, so it\u2019s difficult to know who sees what.\u201dStill, social media remains a compelling proposition for internet companies, even Google, because it keeps people coming back and creates a place for them to spend their time, said Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology data firm Jackdaw Research.\u201cIf you gave Google the choice of having a social network, even with everything that\u2019s happened,\u201d said Mr. Dawson. \u201cI think it would still like to have one.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She was 64.\u201cI am finding great peace today,\u201d she wrote, \u201cknowing that I can thank you for your many years of dedication, viewership and friendship.\u201dNancy Lea Luedtke was born on June 21, 1953, in Neenah, Wis. Her father, Ralph, and her mother, the former Barbara Larson, owned a farm. She learned to sew as a child; for her first sewing project for the local 4-H Club, she made a gathered skirt and fringe scarf.She graduated from Winneconne High School in 1971 and majored in textiles and journalism at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. Her first job was working for a fabric chain, Minnesota Fabrics.\u201cThey had a propensity to hire farm kids, mainly because of their work ethic,\u201d Ms. Zieman said in a 2007 interview.There she met Richard Zieman, whom she married in 1977. In 1979 she started a mail-order sewing-supply business, Nancy\u2019s Notions, which in 1982 led a Milwaukee fabric store to ask her to host a sewing program. It first ran on the nascent Satellite Program Network.\u201cCable TV was in its infancy, and thankfully not many people watched the show because I was really green in front of the camera,\u201d Ms. Zieman said.After about a dozen shows, the store concluded that the effort wasn\u2019t profitable, but Ms. Zieman decided to try to do a version on her own. Wisconsin Public Television began broadcasting \u201cSewing With Nancy\u201d in September 1982, and it was soon being picked up by public television outlets across the United States and in Canada.Ms. Zieman reached a substantial audience of serious sewers and casual ones, delivering tips on stitching, quilting, sewing shortcuts and more. There was nothing flashy about the programs, or about Ms. Zieman\u2019s repartee; just straightforward advice, delivered with geniality.She also published numerous sewing books and made appearances at expos and other events, like one called Sewing Extravaganza in 1992 in Florida that drew 360 people.\u201cThe TV sewing guru had celebrity status with the attendees,\u201d The St. Petersburg Times wrote. \u201cThey crowded around Zieman, who was smartly dressed in a turquoise and pink suit that she made herself.\u201dMs. Zieman was a go-to interview for reporters trying to support a trend of increased interest in sewing, and she had a no-nonsense explanation of that apparent phenomenon.\u201cWe want to feel creative,\u201d she said, \u201cand sewing gives us the chance to create when sometimes work does not.\u201d\u201cI had to pick up my ego from the floor and then say, well, I understand. I understand why people would want to know about this, because it\u2019s unusual to have someone on television who is not picture perfect.\u201d\u201cMail and blog comments prove that something about what happened to me has helped others cope with their own challenges,\u201d Ms. Zieman wrote in her autobiography, \u201cSeams Unlikely: The Inspiring True Life Story of Nancy Zieman,\u201d written with Marjorie L.

He would be well into his teens before learning that the company his father ran with a partner was not, as he had long supposed, some sort of criminal enterprise.What Ronald A. Braverman did was make rubber penises. He also manufactured latex vaginas and hand-shaped items devised for anal insertion and a variety of other novelties associated with masturbatory pleasures. In the evolving parlance of successive eras, those items were euphemistically known first as marital aids \u2014 as though a vibrator were a couples counselor \u2014 and then sex toys and, eventually, \u201cpleasure products.\u201d\u201cSure, people used to joke about it,\u201d Chad said. \u201cDoes your dad really make rubber penises? But then by the time I was in college, it suddenly flipped, and it made me the coolest person around.\u201dOn a day of scorching heat and dry Santa Ana winds gusting over the mountains, the two of us sat in an air-conditioned office at the Doc Johnson headquarters in North Hollywood. Bearded and muscled, Mr. Braverman was clad in Acne jeans, a Buck Mason shirt and a pair of pink Common Products sneakers. Behind his desk a wall of bookshelves held the sports trophies he collects, among them signed Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Wilt Chamberlain basketballs.There is a certain accuracy in the characterization, since almost 75 percent of Doc Johnson products are manufactured in one of seven structures scattered across a sprawling 250,000-square-foot compound, and a \u201cMade in America\u201d emblem is a central element of the Doc Johnson marketing strategy.Here, in the industrial eastern part of the San Fernando Valley, hundreds of workers sculpture, mold, paint, pack and ship the 75,000 products Doc Johnson manufactures weekly. Here, employees in white coats and surgical caps blend six tons of raw material every day, pouring dildos and using air guns to pop each one out of its mold. Here, brass plaques hung in a lobby commemorate employment milestones by generations of mostly Hispanic employees who have raised families on wages earned fabricating devices like Doc Johnson\u2019s best-selling Sasha Grey Masturbator, a lifelike reproduction of the genitals of Ms. Grey, a onetime pornographic star, molded in a casting room on site.\u201cWe now look at what we\u2019re doing as being about creating an experience, like entertainment,\u201d Mr. Braverman said, adding that his company\u2019s trademarked new Kink by Doc Johnson line of products \u2014 rubber sheets, dog collars and assorted fetish gizmos \u2014 \u201cis really killing it.\u201dIf historically \u201cthere was not a lot of brand loyalty and brand awareness\u201d in the sex toy industry, as Mr. Braverman said, that is quickly being modified as manufacturers adapt to an increasingly savvy and fast-growing consumer base.\u201cThey were literally called \u2018What Do Women Want?\u2019\u2019\u2019 she said. It seemed, she said, that everyone, from chief executives to buyers for sex toy stores, was eager to discuss how to recalibrate a business that, as Ron Braverman explained, \u201chad gone from being 100 percent male dominated \u2014 male manufacturers, male bookstore owners, men going to select the product and bring it home \u2014 to being an absolutely female-oriented consumer product.\u201dAs abrupt as the shift seemed at the time, its origins were not altogether surprising. In her book, Ms. Comella argues that, absent the early feminist sex educators and entrepreneurs behind such enlightened sex toy shops as Good Vibrations in San Francisco, success would have been less probable for a mainstream manufacturer like Doc Johnson, whose products are now sold by 7,500 brick-and-mortar stores throughout the United States, on sex-oriented sites like PinkCherry and Lovehoney, and, increasingly, by mass-market retailers.Unwittingly or not, the \u201cfeminist trend of educating women about their bodies, about their clitorises, about vibrators as a tool of self-empowerment,\u201d Ms. Comella said, ultimately benefited the sex toy business by altering cultural perceptions of it and initiating its migration from XXX bookshops to Walmart, Amazon and Target.\u201cIt used to be, \u2018Gee, I\u2019m a man, why would you need any of that?\u2019\u201d Ms. Colvin said. \u201cNow it\u2019s the woman doing the consuming, and it\u2019s not so intimidating for a partner when she introduces a toy into a relationship.\u201dAs seemingly everywhere else in the culture, it is a millennial generation that is leading the charge in mainstream acceptance of a business few still associate with its back-alley beginnings.\u201cSometimes even people in the industry for decades don\u2019t realize how accepted sex toys now are,\u201d said Erica Braverman, the marketing director at Doc Johnson.Just six years separate the two Braverman siblings, and yet one grew up unaware of what the family business was, while the other went to college knowing that full, freaky disclosure was just a Google search away.\u201cWhen I went to college and told people I\u2019m in the family business, no one blinked an eye in a negative way,\u201d Ms. Braverman said. \u201cIt was more like, \u2018OMG, what about Christmas? My birthday is coming up. What am I going to get?\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Missy Elliott\u2019s song \u201cToyz\u201d was released.

Once that first appearance was over, he was interviewed via phone on CNN, where he said the name.\u201cGiven how fast the events transpired Sunday, Congressman Gonzalez took this report as reliable information,\u201d his office said in a statement. \u201cIt is something that he deeply regrets.\u201dA shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., killed at least 26 people on Sunday.The statement added that Mr. Gonzalez \u201cdoes not follow memes, internet sensations, or Twitter trends and was unaware that this name is a viral internet hoax that has been connected to mass shootings in the past.\u201dBut the Sam Hyde meme was only one of many strains of disinformation that spread immediately after the shooting, in a pattern that has become as familiar as mass shootings themselves.In the wake of mass shootings, anonymous social media accounts often post images of Mr. Hyde holding firearms, accompanied by false information linking him to the massacre. Many of those posting about Mr. Hyde see it as the kind of repetitive joke that sustains memes for years on end.Justin Hendrix, the executive director of NYC Media Lab, an organization that encourages innovation in media, highlighted another source of disinformation on Sunday: a set of tweets that were amplified by Google immediately after the shooting.In an interview on Monday, Mr. Hendrix pointed out that such tweets were filling a news hole in the immediate aftermath of a news event, during which consumers are hungry for information.\u201cThe trolls and bots know it, and they\u2019re able to game the algorithms,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil the algorithms have something that has some credibility to fill the void, they\u2019ll just fill it with anything.\u201dIn a statement, Google said that such search results changed second by second, and that it would continue to try to improve how such tweets were ranked.Other rumors spread directly after the Texas shooting. But Emily Thorson, a political scientist at Syracuse University who specializes in the way that misinformation affects American politics, questioned the value of highlighting such information, even if only to debunk it.She said that members of the mainstream media \u2014 including Google \u2014 pay far closer attention to social media, particularly Twitter, than most Americans. She added that the symbiosis between the two types of media could amplify and spread false news, even when outlets like The New York Times were trying to do the opposite.\u201cWhen you see a piece of misinformation, even when it\u2019s in the context of being corrected and you believe the correction, it can still have lingering effects on your attitudes,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Good Day in New York for a Former TV Anchor", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsAt first glance, it seemed as if Greg Kelly soared into Judith Grey\u2019s world straight from the colorful panels of a comic book series.When they met for a first date in December 2015, Mr. Kelly was already a millionaire playboy with an alter ego \u2014 a broadcast journalist with a fighter pilot\u2019s past \u2014 that would make a superhero blush.He was also at the beck and call of a police commissioner, who happened to be his father, in a place known as Gotham City, and Mr. Kelly had a reputation for fighting bad guys.\u201cPeople loved him on television not just because he was smart and handsome, but because he was very real,\u201d said Rosanna Scotto, who was Mr. Kelly\u2019s co-host on \u201cGood Day New York,\u201d on Fox 5/WNYW, for the better part of a decade before he left the show in September. (He first joined the Fox News Channel in 2002, and went on to serve as a White House correspondent from 2005 to 2007.)\u201cHis sense of humor is off the charts, and he has an uncanny knowledge of things about New York that you would never expect,\u201d said Ms. Scotto, who now anchors \u201cGood Day New York\u201d with Lori Stokes. \u201cThose are some of the things that made him a superstar.\u201dDespite his celebrity, Mr. Kelly was nary a blip on Ms. Grey\u2019s radar screen when they were first made aware of each other by a mutual friend who had sent them an introductory email in September 2015.\u201cI had never heard of Greg, but then I Googled him and saw this gorgeous guy, with gorgeous green eyes,\u201d said Ms. Grey, a 47-year-old freelance creative director in advertising from Melbourne, Australia.\u201cI was like, \u2018Yeah, set me up, let\u2019s do this,\u2019 \u201d she said.But Ms. Grey, by all accounts a rock star in her industry, was given short shrift by a lifelong bachelor whose television career had given him a good measure of fame and fortune, and a predominantly female fan club to go with it.\u201cHe didn\u2019t call,\u201d she said with a sigh, \u201cbut I kind of knew why.\u201dShe noted that the introductory email, albeit well-intentioned, provided a fairly \u201cunderwhelming\u201d profile of herself.Mr. Kelly, 48, who said that the email \u201creally undersold Judith to me and did not do her justice,\u201d ran into another mutual friend three months later who offered a much brighter endorsement of Ms. Grey.This time he did call, and soon after they were on a first date at the Park, a restaurant in Manhattan.\u201cI sat there and watched this beautiful, stunning woman in a charcoal gray dress walk through the door, she looked amazing,\u201d Mr. Kelly recalled. \u201cWe started talking and I realized how sweet and intelligent she was, and we had a lot in common.\u201dMs. Grey was equally impressed when she saw Mr. Kelly, who was wearing a gray pinstriped double-breasted suit.\u201cI liked the way he looked,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just sat there talking for hours, easily going from topic to topic, about politics, literature, just about anything, and we understood all of each other\u2019s references.\u201d\u201cIt was this easygoing, wonderful, vibrant evening that you just didn\u2019t want to end,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Doesn\u2019t he have to get up at 4 a.m.?\u2019 \u201dTwo days later, they went for drinks at another Manhattan restaurant, the Red Cat, where they continued moving easily from topic to topic, all the while learning the things that ultimately put them on the road to each other.Ms. Grey, the youngest of three children born to Eva Menahem, a real estate investor, and Samuel Menahem, a pediatric cardiologist and professor at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, graduated from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology with a bachelor of fine arts degree and received a bachelor of science in neuroscience from Columbia.Her career began as an artist in Melbourne, where her oil paintings were displayed and sold. She transitioned into the world of advertising, which took her from Sydney to Hong Kong and to New York in 1997, where she became the architect of numerous campaigns for various companies, including Pfizer, Hong Kong Bank and Georgia-Pacific. (She was also a writer, contributing to the Daily Beast and Business Insider, and she wrote and directed the 2003 award-winning documentary \u201cSin Embargo: Never the Less,\u201d on the resilience of the Cuban people.)\u201cJudith is simply brilliant,\u201d said Jennifer Pybus, a friend and business partner.\u201cIn the world of advertising, she is formidable, she\u2019s the real deal,\u201d Ms. Pybus said. \u201cShe\u2019s elevated and reinvented so many brands for some of the best agencies in the world. She somehow knows what people want before they even know they want it.\u201dMr. Kelly graduated from Fordham University with a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science and went on to serve nine years as an attack pilot in the United States Marine Corps, specializing in flying the AV-8B Harrier jet. During his service, Mr. Kelly amassed 158 aircraft carrier landings and flew over Iraq in Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the United Nations-imposed no-fly zone.\u201cGreg was a bit of a maverick back then,\u201d said Ossen D\u2019Haiti, a fellow Marine pilot and longtime friend who served with Mr. Kelly in the early 1990s. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of guy you want in your squadron. He doesn\u2019t get too uptight, and finds levity in everything he does.\u201dDuring that particular battle, Mr. Kelly was wounded, struck in the face by shrapnel.\u201cMy wife and I were watching it on the news, and there was Greg, a world away, just lying on the ground, motionless,\u201d Raymond Kelly recalled. \u201cAll we could do was just hold on to each other and pray.\u201dMr. Kelly\u2019s injuries proved minimal, however, and he was \u201cout of action for about half an afternoon,\u201d as he put it.Mr. Kelly, a licensed commercial pilot, later went on to achieve the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps Reserves, which he left in 2014.\u201cHe\u2019s a Marine, like his father was, like I was,\u201d said the former Mayor David N. Dinkins, a longtime family friend. \u201cJust a rock-solid, respectable young man.\u201dMs. Grey and Mr. Kelly turned a serious corner on their third date, when he took her to a brunch in West Point, N.Y., then surprised her by driving to his family\u2019s 40-person Christmas party in Breezy Point, N.Y., where she met his parents, as well as his brother, Jim Kelly.\u201cShe couldn\u2019t believe he took her to meet his family so early in their relationship, and she absolutely loved his parents,\u201d Ms. Pybus said. \u201cThat\u2019s when she told me, \u2018This is different, this is it.\u2019 That\u2019s when she knew.\u201dThe former police commissioner, who, at times, playfully interrogated his son about settling down, had a hunch that Ms. Grey was in their lives to stay.\u201cJudith is a beautiful, amazing, multitalented individual,\u201d said the elder Mr. Kelly, who served as New York\u2019s top cop from 1992 to 1994 under Mr. Dinkins, and again, from 2002 to 2013, under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.\u201cShe spent a lot of time with us this past summer and we really got to know her and realized that she and Greg are in perfect sync with one another, two hard-working people with a great sense of humor,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as Veronica and I are concerned, she\u2019s the daughter we never had.\u201dGreg Kelly said that as his relationship with Ms. Grey deepened, he would often asked himself, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I met this person before?\u201dAs it turned out, he almost had.\u201cAfter much triangulation, I eventually realized I had actually seen Judith months before being introduced to her,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cI was in Sag Harbor, and I noticed this beautiful woman stretching and jogging at the dock, but she was wearing earphones, which I took as a sign that she didn\u2019t want to be bothered.\u201d\u201cI had just finished working out at a gym there and was standing some distance away, but it was definitely Judith, who has a place out in Sag Harbor,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cI actually went back the next day to see if I would see her again, but she wasn\u2019t there.\u201dThough he eventually caught up to her, Mr. Kelly would lose Ms. Grey again in March of this year. They split up that month. The inevitable talk of marriage put a strain on their relationship.\u201cHe was nervous about committing,\u201d Ms. Grey said.Mr. Kelly did not disagree.\u201cThere was some pressure, certainly a little bit of \u2018Am I ready?\u2019 that sort of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there were other things going on at the time, it was complex.\u201dAfter nearly seven months apart, they began talking through some issues and came to realize that they were meant to be.\u201cJudith is the love of my life,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cFrom the first time we met, I knew she was good for me.\u201cShe is brilliant, beautiful and giving,\u201d he added. \u201cShe has taken care of me and brought real stability to my life.\u201dThey reunited, and were engaged on Labor Day. \u201cOur getting back together was our engagement,\u201d Ms. Grey said. \u201cWhen I look at him, I still see a man constantly grappling with how to be a better person, but he\u2019s very warm and caring, and he has an encyclopedic mind and a real sense of consciousness.\u201dThey were married at the University Club of New York on Nov. 12, where the cocktail reception was also held. Mr. Dinkins led the ceremony, a first marriage for both, which did not include religious traditions (the bride is Jewish and the groom is Roman Catholic).\u201cYou must always remember that it is rarely the great things that destroy a home, it is more often the small things,\u201d Mr. Dinkins told the couple and their 200 guests, including Fran\u00e7ois Delattre, the permanent representative of France to the United Nations in New York, John Catsimatidis of supermarket fame and Rhona Graff, President Trump\u2019s longtime executive assistant.\u201cSo that each of you take care of the small things,\u201d Mr. Dinkins said, \u201cthen together you can defend your home against the great things.\u201dWhen asked what kind of man Ms. Grey had exchanged vows with, Ms. Scotto said without hesitation: \u201cJudith is marrying a man who was like a brother to me, a man who brought sunshine, laughter and just the unexpected to my world every morning for almost 10 years, a man I really miss.\u201dBut she doesn\u2019t miss taking calls about him.\u201cMy phone would ring constantly with women asking about Greg,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I kept hearing was \u2018Is Greg available?\u2019 Is Greg still single?\u2019\u201cNow I can happily say, \u2018He\u2019s off the market ladies, back off.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington\u2019s Tent: A Detective Story", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThere was a marquee tent up on a hillside,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Could it be\u2026?\u2019\u201dThat would be enough of a coup. But the eyewitness was Pierre Charles L\u2019Enfant, the French-born military engineer and future planner of Washington, D.C., who had rendered the scene with meticulous accuracy.\u201cWe have no photographs of this army, and suddenly here is the equivalent of Google Street View,\u201d Mr. Mead said. \u201cLooking at it, you feel like you are walking right into the past.\u201dWe spoke with Mr. Mead, who is also the museum\u2019s director of curatorial affairs, and R. Scott Stephenson, the museum\u2019s vice president of collections, exhibitions and programming, about the detective work that went into identifying the watercolor, which will be the centerpiece of an exhibition opening on Jan. 13.The auction listing identified the watercolor as coming from the papers of Thomas Digges, who was related to a prominent Maryland family that had housed L\u2019Enfant at the end of his life. The watercolor at the Library of Congress had been acquired in 1920 from that same family. (Later, the museum\u2019s researchers determined that a brief inscription on the back of the new watercolor matched L\u2019Enfant\u2019s handwriting.)The museum paid $13,750 for the watercolor, including the buyer\u2019s premium. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to discuss value, but hmmmm\u2026,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \u201cFortunately, no one else seemed to have figured out it was by L\u2019Enfant.\u201dThe auction listing described the watercolor as dating from the Battle of Stony Point in July 1779. But the museum determined that it actually depicts the Continental Army\u2019s encampment at Verplanck\u2019s Point, just across the Hudson, in the fall of 1782. \u201cThis encampment, with all its beauty, was a diplomatic act,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \u201cThey knew they needed to impress the world.\u201dThe scene had been partially captured by the painter John Trumbull, who did a portrait of Washington and his horse at Verplanck\u2019s that he later presented to Martha Washington. The oval-shaped tent itself is not visible in Trumbull\u2019s painting. \u201cBut now, because of this new watercolor and the research we\u2019ve done, we can tell it shows Washington standing right in front of the tent,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said.The curators had a sense of the general appearance of the encampment from letters and diaries by contemporary eyewitnesses, like one British traveler who described it as having \u201cthe most beautiful and picturesque appearance.\u201d The encampment\u2019s layout and details, down to the number of tents, were also recorded in a map, now owned by Harvard University, which came from the papers of Washington\u2019s headquarters. The details on that map precisely match those in the watercolor.\u201cThe map was like the key that unlocks the whole thing,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \u201cYou can tell exactly where L\u2019Enfant was sitting to get that particular perspective.\u201dWritten accounts of the encampment describe the bowers that each regiment erected in front of their tents to provide shade and protection, with symbols indicating the regiments\u2019 origins.After the Revolution, Washington\u2019s tent was erected at various ceremonial occasions, including at Fort McHenry during the Marquis de Lafayette\u2019s triumphant return to the United States in 1824. It seems never to have been captured in its unfurled glory, though it did make one odd cameo in 19th-century art history.In 1853, Harper\u2019s Magazine published an engraving of the rolled-up tent as part of a story about Revolutionary War relics stored at the Virginia home of Robert E. Lee, whose wife was the great-granddaughter of Martha Washington. The standing tent is visible in one historical photograph, from around 1909, when it was pitched in the snow at Valley Forge by Rev. W. Herbert Burk, the founder of the Valley Forge Historical Society, who had purchased it from Lee\u2019s daughter.At the museum, which acquired the historical society\u2019s collection in 2003, the elaborately restored tent is the big reveal at the end of a dramatic movie.But L\u2019Enfant\u2019s image shows something described in documents that has disappeared: the elaborate neoclassical wooden entrance erected in front of the tent at some encampments.\u201cThis is the equivalent of the Oval Office on a lonely windswept hill,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said of the tent as seen in the watercolor. \u201cIt combines private and public Washington, all in one view.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Panic After Trump\u2019s Account Is Deleted Caps a Rough Week", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the company, customer service representatives, public relations managers and executives \u2014 including Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey \u2014 were bombarded by people asking what had happened to the president\u2019s account, which Mr. Trump regularly uses as a megaphone for all manner of matters. No one had answers, according to current and former Twitter employees who were involved or briefed on the situation, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were private.Only after further review did executives discover that it was a contractor who was leaving Twitter that day who had disabled Mr. Trump\u2019s account, said the people involved in the matter.The incident immediately made the unnamed contractor a hero to some and a villain to others for muting, even temporarily, Mr. Trump. Yet the outcome for Twitter was black and white: It was another fiasco that the social media company had to clean up.Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s deleted account showed how empty some of those promises seemed. Late Thursday, Twitter employees gathered in private Slack channels and used Twitter to send direct messages to one another to remark on how insecure Mr. Trump\u2019s account had been, according to people involved in the conversations. Hundreds of employees can access the accounts of so-called Very Important Tweeters and can take actions like disabling the accounts, according to the current and former employees.Mr. Trump, for his part, remarked that the incident reflected the impact his Twitter messages have had. He tweeted with gusto on Friday, firing off more than a dozen messages over the course of the day on issues including ISIS and Hillary Clinton.The discovery that it was a contractor who deleted Mr. Trump\u2019s account is difficult for Twitter, as well as other technology companies. Nearly every major technology company including Google, Facebook and Apple relies on contract employees to fill positions. In general, the jobs tend to be nontechnical roles such as customer support or administrative and operational positions.Many of these workers are brought on by staffing companies like Accenture, Adecco and Cognizant and work on renewable one-year contracts. Facebook, Twitter and other companies also outsource content review to third-party services like ProUnlimited and Cognizant, which are essentially internet call centers staffed with hundreds of workers who deal with customer service issues.Many of these people work side by side with full-time employees, but they are often paid significantly less, are identified with different color employee badges, and are not afforded the same perks and amenities that full-time workers have. Many complain of being treated like second-class citizens.At the congressional hearings this week, Facebook and Twitter had discussed how they planned to hire more people to help prohibit the misuse of their platforms. Facebook said it was hiring an additional 10,000 workers to review flagged content, bringing the total to 20,000 by the end of 2018.At Twitter, employees have long expressed concern about the widely available nature of internal tools for handling customer accounts. Disabling an account is typically an easy two- or three-step process, according to current and former Twitter employees. Certain teams at the company \u2014 including trust and safety, and operations \u2014 have access to all accounts including the highest levels.Twitter customer support cannot, however, access customers\u2019 private direct messages, nor can it tweet on behalf of other users, these people said.In the past, Twitter has discussed adding additional layers of security that would prohibit wide internal access to V.I.T. accounts, according to these people. That included a kind of \u201cdual layer\u201d of security, requiring assurances from multiple employees to make significant changes to accounts.In the end, the company did not follow through with the plans, these people said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "LinkedIn Faces Setback in China as It Runs Afoul of New Rules", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 LinkedIn is often held up as a model of how a foreign internet company can do business in China. Increasingly, it also serves as an example of how difficult that task can be.This week, the jobs-and-professional-networking service blocked individuals from advertising jobs on its site in China, after it ran afoul of new government regulations requiring it to verify the individuals\u2019 identities, according to a person familiar with the situation. LinkedIn said in a statement that companies could still post job listings but that it did not know when it would again allow individuals to do the same.In August, China\u2019s government increased scrutiny on internet job postings in response to a rash of online hiring scams, mostly for pyramid schemes. New regulations call for companies to have verification of the identities of those posting job listings.Beijing has been following up its new regulation with audits, according to the person, who asked not to be named because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.But in recent months, Beijing has ratcheted up its already strict internet controls, and such an approach to managing the web takes its toll on companies.After being forced to borrow hundreds of dollars from family and friends, Mr. Li drowned himself in a small pond along a highway on the outskirts of Tianjin, a port city near Beijing.His death was one of several since the summer, which has spurred an uproar across the country and prompted a government-led crackdown on pyramid schemes.The company has struggled to become a major player there. In part, that is because of China\u2019s unique internet culture. While hiring sites are popular, many people opt to manage their professional contacts in the country\u2019s most popular social network, WeChat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Shop Smart on Black Friday (and Cyber Monday)", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLong before your Thanksgiving dinner has settled, retailers start to lure you in on Black Friday and Cyber Monday with doorbuster sales and in-store discounts.Online stores have already begun \u201cleaking\u201d their big \u2014 and now weeklong \u2014 Cyber Monday sales.Whether you plan to get in line or shop from home, here are some ways to beat the marketing madness and be a smart shopper.It\u2019s hard not to get caught up in the retail frenzy, even if you don\u2019t want to. The ads are everywhere, everyone is talking about deals and it seems like everyone has something on sale.On the surface, it seems appealing: You get an early start on holiday shopping and you save some money, too. If that refrain sounds familiar \u2014 like you fell for it last year \u2014 do a little homework now to save yourself both temptation and money later.If you want a specific item, check its price today at multiple stores. Add those items to a wishlist or your shopping cart (and then abandon the cart) so you can see how much the prices change between now and Cyber Monday. This helps reveal exactly how big a discount that sale price really is.Retailers often offer deep discounts on limited quantities or specific product models in order to lure in buyers. Making a list in advance avoids the old \u201cthis is close enough\u201d rationalization, and it\u2019ll keep you from buying something you didn\u2019t really want just because it was on sale.\u201cMake sure you note the correct model number, since sometimes during the holidays, retailers will feature products that look almost identical but might have completely different features than you\u2019re expecting,\u201d Mr. Burakowski said.But do retailers mark up items just to slash their prices on Black Friday?Aside from using wish lists to track prices, there are tools for your smartphone or computer that can help make sure you\u2019re actually getting a bargain.The downside to tools like these is that they require extensive information about where you\u2019re shopping and what you\u2019re buying in order to work. Similarly, many of them get a cut of your total when you place an order with an online retailer. Neither approach is insidious, but you should be aware of both before you use them.When asked if you should jump on deals as soon as you see them, Mr. Burakowski said there\u2019s no need to. \u201cLast year, we saw a tremendous growth in retailers starting their deals Thursday \u2014 as in, we posted almost as many deals Thursday as we did Friday, and a similar amount on Monday,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the Monday ones were repeats of the ones featured across Thursday and Friday, so you may get another chance to score some of those deals you missed out on.\u201dMr. McAllister agreed. \u201cSome Black Friday deals are already going live, and almost all of them will be available on or before Thanksgiving day,\u201d he said. A lot of those will remain available through the weekend, and bleed into the deals advertised as part of Cyber Monday, which will mostly go live on Sunday, because these terms are effectively meaningless at this point. Internally, we just refer to the whole thing as Deals Week.\u201dJust keep an eye on stock levels. Only jump if you\u2019re worried something will be so popular it\u2019ll sell out.Shopping online in your pajamas is certainly more comfortable than sitting in the cold waiting for a store to open. Mr. Burakowski said that if your impulse is to stay home, follow it.\u201cI\u2019ve never liked lining up overnight and don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it in 99 percent of cases, unless you\u2019ve got a very specific product in mind that has extremely limited quantities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile everything you see offline will be available online, it can be a lot more difficult to get one of the truly rare deals online than if you\u2019re first in line and guaranteed to get it.\u201d\u201cThe only place you should line up on Thanksgiving afternoon is on the line of scrimmage for a family football game,\u201d Mr. McAllister said. \u201cBasically every deal you can get in stores will be available online, and usually matched by multiple other retailers. There are still a handful of doorbusters that are really and truly brick-and-mortar only, but they\u2019re typically low-quality products that you should probably avoid anyway.\u201dFor some, lining up for Black Friday deals is tradition, or a way to spend the day after Thanksgiving getting into the holiday shopping spirit. If getting the best deals and saving money is your goal, it\u2019s not worth it.Keep an eye on your credit and bank statements for fraudulent charges, avoid signing up for high-interest store cards or giving out too much personal information, and use strong passwords when shopping and banking online.Similarly, take steps to protect yourself from online shopping scams and bait-and-switch listings.Shop from reputable sellers and retailers \u2014 and that includes on sites like Amazon, which allow third-parties to list products for sale.Mr. Burakowski noted: \u201cI\u2019d advise shoppers to be extra careful about third party listings on some of the major sites like Amazon. We\u2019ve been seeing a fair few more scam listings, dramatically below the street price of the item from sellers with zero feedback that somehow can become the featured seller.\u201d This rule also applies to sites like eBay, Jet, Shopify and eBid.The best thing you can do is just be patient. Sometimes the best deals are yet to come, and you\u2019ll find them later in the season, on your own schedule, from a retailer you trust. Do your homework and keep a cool head, and you\u2019ll be happier for it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Where Self-Driving Cars Go to Learn", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "Arizona\u2019s promise to keep the driverless car industry free of regulations has attracted dozens of companies, including Uber, Waymo and Lyft.Supported byIt was January 2015 and the Phoenix area was about to host the Super Bowl. Mr. Ducey learned that a local regulator was planning a sting on Lyft and Uber drivers to shut down the ride-hailing services for operating illegally. Mr. Ducey, a Republican who was the former chief executive of the ice cream chain Cold Stone Creamery, was furious.\u201cIt was the exact opposite message we should have been sending,\u201d Mr. Ducey said in an interview. \u201cWe needed our message to Uber, Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas.\u201d If the state had a slogan, he added, it would include the words \u201copen for business.\u201dArizona has since built upon the governor\u2019s action to become a favored partner for the tech industry, turning itself into a live laboratory for self-driving vehicles. Over the past two years, Arizona deliberately cultivated a rules-free environment for driverless cars, unlike dozens of other states that have enacted autonomous vehicle regulations over safety, taxes and insurance.The payoff for Arizona has been a tech boom, with dozens of autonomous vehicle companies flocking here to set up operations. Every day, Waymo, the driverless car business owned by Google\u2019s corporate parent Alphabet, as well as Uber, Lyft, General Motors and Intel now deploy hundreds of cars that drive themselves on the streets of Phoenix, a sprawling metropolis of 1.4 million people.But Arizona\u2019s permissiveness has drawn criticism from safety advocates who said the companies have too much freedom to conduct their trials on public roads. They said car companies and state officials have not solved questions about the privacy of passengers, the prevention of cyberattacks on autonomous cars, and how to insure vehicles that don\u2019t have a driver.Arizona officials said the public is essentially protected by basic rules that require a licensed driver somewhere in the driverless car. They added that they planned to take a back seat to the experts when it comes to rule-making. The state insurance regulator, for example, said he would wait for the insurance industry to guide regulators on liability policies for driverless cars, amid questions about who is responsible in a crash if the car isn\u2019t driven by a human.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be getting in the way by prescribing regulations when we really don\u2019t know how the equipment will perform,\u201d said John Halikowski, director of the Arizona Department of Transportation.The state\u2019s hands-off approach has already been tested. In March, Arizona experienced its first crash involving a driverless car, when a human-driven vehicle collided with a self-driving Uber in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. The case was quickly resolved because police said Uber\u2019s car was not at fault, but some Arizona officials acknowledged they have not thought through all the legal scenarios with autonomous car accidents.\u201cWe embrace innovation,\u201d said Mark Mitchell, the mayor of Tempe. \u201cBut there are some things we\u2019ll have to look at moving forward.\u201d\u201cWe can beat California in every metric; lower taxes, less regulations, cost of living, quality of life,\u201d he said several months after he became governor.In early 2015, Mr. Ducey\u2019s shutdown of the sting operation that would have hit Uber and Lyft had an immediate effect. Days after his decision, which the companies were made aware of by his staff, Lyft and Uber executives called the governor to thank him.By August 2015, Mr. Ducey was taking his first steps into driverless vehicles. That month, he signed an executive order supporting autonomous cars. Under that order, any driverless car could be on Arizona roads as long as a passenger had a license and the car had a basic liability insurance plan.Mr. Ducey also set up a \u201cSelf-Driving Vehicle Oversight Committee\u201d comprised of transportation, public safety, insurance and other regulators to advise \u201chow best to advance the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles on public roads.\u201d The group was not intended to create any new rules.And Mr. Ducey became a pitchman.Early last year at a global economic forum on the Georgia coast, Mr. Ducey said he approached Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, with a business card and talking points on the state\u2019s embrace of self-driving automakers. Shortly thereafter, Waymo scoped out Chandler to begin autonomous car tests.Chandler\u2019s officials sealed the deal with further promises to stay out of the way. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s our role to be engaged in regulation,\u201d said Micah Miranda, Chandler\u2019s director of economic development.Waymo opened operations in Chandler in August 2016, hiring dozens of local test drivers. The company hosted a grand opening with Mr. Ducey and Chandler\u2019s mayor, and held several community events to win over the public.\u201cThe enthusiasm for new tech from the public and Governor Ducey makes Arizona a place where innovation can thrive and companies like ours can set up roots,\u201d said Waymo.Mr. Ducey also traveled to Silicon Valley to visit driverless car companies and investors. In late 2016, he stopped by Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that has invested in companies including Lyft, which is working on self-driving technology. There, Mr. Ducey found an inquisitive audience about the state\u2019s regulation-free policy for self-driving cars.\u201cAlthough Washington gets much of the attention, a lot of the real action on tech policy is taking place at the state and local level,\u201d said Ted Ullyot, an Andreessen Horowitz partner who attended the meeting. \u201cGovernor Ducey is a key pro-innovation leader, making Arizona a highly welcoming environment for autonomous vehicles and other emerging technologies.\u201dIn California, Google, Uber, GM, and Ford have fought lawmakers on self-driving rules. One rule required carmakers to report on the number of times a driverless car switched from autonomous mode to human-driven mode, which irked automakers who said those statistics give a misleading impression of safety.Uber\u2019s executives called Mr. Ducey.\u201cWe responded by saying we weren\u2019t going to hassle them,\u201d Mr. Ducey said of Uber. \u201cI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t thank my partner in growing the Arizona economy, Jerry Brown,\u201d the Democratic governor of California.\u201cGovernor Ducey\u2019s prioritization of the sharing economy has made the Grand Canyon State an ideal environment for our self-driving pilot,\u201d Uber said.Under Mr. Ducey, driverless car experiments in Arizona have multiplied over the last year.Uber\u2019s self-driving Volvo SUVs now pick up customers around Tempe on a daily basis. Waymo has dispatched more than 100 Chrysler self-driving minivans to chauffeur select families and other residents as part of a closely guarded trial; the company plans to expand to 600 vehicles by the end of the year, with the majority in Chandler. And dozens of vehicles for GM, Ford, Intel, and Lyft are also covering thousands of miles a day on the flat and sun-drenched roads around Phoenix.Some residents are ambivalent. Groups representing the blind are enthusiastic supporters of driverless cars, which could give their members more independence. Others like the idea of tech-related jobs coming to the state. But some are cautious.\u201cI\u2019m on the fence,\u201d said Jake Guadarrama, 22, a Phoenix area resident. \u201cWhat if the battery died on the car and it goes out of control? And will it take way from the work force?\u201dThose questions are not just academic. Already, the incorporation of driverless cars into human-driven traffic has run into problems.Around dusk on March 24, for example, Alexandra Cole, a Tempe resident, inched her 2008 Honda CRV into a busy suburban intersection in the city. With five seconds left on the pedestrian crossing signal and no cars coming toward her in the two closest lanes, she began a left turn.She did not see Uber\u2019s self-driving Volvo SUV darting through the yellow light in the furthest lane toward her. The cars collided. Uber\u2019s vehicle flipped onto its side and crashed into two more cars waiting in traffic.But what happened after the accident revealed a system that was unprepared for computer-operated vehicles. Mr. Ducey, Tempe officials and state transportation regulators did not get briefed on the collision. The self-driving task force set up by the governor, which has met twice in two years, also did not review the incident.Uber sent its wrecked vehicle to its Pittsburgh-based autonomous vehicle center, which the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration officials visited to investigate. N.H.T.S.A. said it could not comment because its investigation is still in progress. Ms. Cole and her insurance company declined to comment.Insurance would also have been a question, with debate over who takes responsibility in a driverless car crash \u2014 the company or the third-party software or parts makers or the passenger with a license \u2014 since there is no driver.\u201cThe insurance companies need to figure out how they will insure this,\u201d said Stephen Briggs, a spokesman for Arizona\u2019s Department of Insurance. Arizona hasn\u2019t changed its minimum insurance liability rules for self-driving car trials. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have the resources to do this.\u201dAngel Carbajal, Tempe\u2019s assistant chief of police, acknowledged there are many unknowns. \u201cThis is new, so there isn\u2019t a lot of legislation yet that explains how to respond to motor vehicle collisions involving autonomous vehicles,\u201d he said.For Mr. Ducey, none of this is a problem. He said the crash was handled properly and that even if driverless technology is not fully ready, the state\u2019s bet on autonomous vehicles will continue.\u201cThese are cultural opportunities for Arizona to be seen as a place to live, work and play,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ajit Pai: Media Ownership Rules Must Adjust to the Digital Era", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDo you check your Twitter feed to get the latest news? Monitor trending topics on your Facebook page to see what\u2019s making headlines? Set news alerts on Google News? Read blogs analyzing the latest at the White House? Watch breaking news on cable networks or YouTube channels?No doubt most of you do some or all of these things. But none of these information sources exist in the regulatory world of the Federal Communications Commission, where core media ownership rules presume the marketplace for news is defined entirely by pulp, rabbit ears and transistor radios. In this archaic world, Americans get their news only from newspapers and broadcast television and radio stations, and the internet doesn\u2019t exist.For over four decades, the F.C.C. has restricted the ability of broadcast media outlets to also own newspapers, and vice versa, in the same market, under what is known as the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule.This rule was established in 1975 with the stated purpose of preserving and promoting a diversity of viewpoints. Arguably, it made sense at the time. But with the internet now dominating the news landscape, the rule is no longer needed, and may actually be undermining the diversity of viewpoints it was intended to foster.For newspapers to continue to play an important role in civic engagement, they need more access to capital. Their decline has created a real threat to independent reporting at the state and local level. A broadcaster\u2019s investment in a newspaper could go a long way toward keeping citizens informed. (Indeed, the number of TV and radio stations has doubled over the past half-century, even as newspapers have been vanishing.)Critics of this proposal have expressed concern that eliminating the rule will lead to additional media consolidation. I understand that point of view and recognize that some limits are needed. That\u2019s why, for example, F.C.C. rules will continue to prohibit any company from owning more than two television stations in any market.But as with any issue, it is important to go beyond the slogans and look at the specifics. And whether we look at the history of grandfathered newspaper-broadcast combinations in bigger cities like Chicago or smaller ones like Scranton, Pa., experience does not show that the residents in those communities have been harmed or their news marketplaces have been monopolized. Rather, we generally see news outlets that have been able to better serve the public.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Case for Removing Extremist Videos From the Internet", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsIn December 2015, a search for \u201cAnwar al-Awlaki\u201d on YouTube yielded nearly 60,000 results for his sermons and lectures. By last August, there were more than 70,000 results. An hourlong polemic by Mr. Awlaki demonizing the United States titled \u201cBattle of the Hearts and Minds\u201d had more than 80,000 views and 700 likes.The removal of this online content will ultimately save lives. There are at least 90 instances in which extremists in the United States and Europe were shown to have had ties to or been influenced by Mr. Awlaki, including the Fort Hood gunman, Nidal Hassan; the \u201cunderwear bomber,\u201d Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab; the Charlie Hebdo attackers Sa\u00efd and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi; Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in Orlando, Fla.; and the Boston Marathon bombers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev.YouTube\u2019s recent action was a significant step in a new direction, but now more must be done. Mr. Awlaki\u2019s content should be removed from all other Google sites, including the file-sharing platform Google Drive. Other internet companies, large and small, should look to YouTube\u2019s example and follow suit.Recently, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube established the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism to share information and best practices about how to counter the threat of terrorist content online. A zero-tolerance policy regarding Mr. Awlaki and similar figures would be a model for other companies.In that same vein, industrywide standards are needed to ensure the timely and permanent removal of dangerous content, especially when produced by groups and individuals on the State Department\u2019s Foreign Terrorist Organizations list, the Treasury Department\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list, and the United Nations Security Council Sanctions list, and individuals with demonstrable links to violence.There is no shortage of extremists online \u2014 Turki al-Binali, Abdullah Faisal, Yusuf al-Qaradawi and Ahmad Musa Jibril are notable examples. They must be subject to the same treatment and their content should be swiftly and permanently removed.YouTube\u2019s acknowledgment of the harmful impact of the Awlaki sermons should also open the door to a broader and more consistent approach against the content posted by the Islamic State online.The group\u2019s sophisticated exploitation of the internet to spread its message must be matched by a systematic and resource-intensive effort that includes website hosting companies such as WordPress, encrypted communications platforms such as Telegram and file-sharing platforms such as JustPaste.it, apart from video platforms such as YouTube.Killing terrorists is only half the battle, as the case of Mr. Awlaki has clearly shown. A new focus on combating extremist and terrorist ideologies online, through company policies, industrywide standards and technology, will be paramount in keeping the public safe.Mark Wallace, the chief executive of the Counter Extremism Project, was an ambassador to the United Nations in the George W. Bush administration. Frances Fragos Townsend, the president of the project, led the Homeland Security Council from 2004 to 2008.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Internet Is Dying. Repealing Net Neutrality Hastens That Death.", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe internet is dying.Sure, technically, the internet still works. Pull up Facebook on your phone and you will still see your second cousin\u2019s baby pictures. But that isn\u2019t really the internet. It\u2019s not the open, anyone-can-build-it network of the 1990s and early 2000s, the product of technologies created over decades through government funding and academic research, the network that helped undo Microsoft\u2019s stranglehold on the tech business and gave us upstarts like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix.Because net neutrality shelters start-ups \u2014 which can\u2019t easily pay for fast-line access \u2014 from internet giants that can pay, the rules are just about the last bulwark against the complete corporate takeover of much of online life. When the rules go, the internet will still work, but it will look like and feel like something else altogether \u2014 a network in which business development deals, rather than innovation, determine what you experience, a network that feels much more like cable TV than the technological Wild West that gave you Napster and Netflix.The five most valuable American companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 control much of the online infrastructure, from app stores to operating systems to cloud storage to nearly all of the online ad business. A handful of broadband companies \u2014 AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon, many of which are also aiming to become content companies, because why not \u2014 provide virtually all the internet connections to American homes and smartphones.Together these giants have carved the internet into a historically profitable system of fiefs. They have turned a network whose very promise was endless innovation into one stuck in mud, where every start-up is at the tender mercy of some of the largest corporations on the planet.The internet\u2019s singular power, in its early gold-rush days, was its flexibility. People could imagine a dazzling array of new uses for the network, and as quick as that, they could build and deploy them \u2014 a site that sold you books, a site that cataloged the world\u2019s information, an application that let you \u201cborrow\u201d other people\u2019s music, a social network that could connect you to anyone.You didn\u2019t need permission for any of this stuff; some of these innovations ruined traditional industries, some fundamentally altered society, and many were legally dubious. But the internet meant you could just put it up, and if it worked, the rest of the world would quickly adopt it.But if flexibility was the early internet\u2019s promise, it was soon imperiled. In 2003, Tim Wu, a law professor now at Columbia Law School (he\u2019s also a contributor to The New York Times), saw signs of impending corporate control over the growing internet. Broadband companies that were investing great sums to roll out faster and faster internet service to Americans were becoming wary of running an anything-goes network.Though it has been through a barrage of legal challenges and resurrections, some form of net neutrality has been the governing regime on the internet since 2005. The new F.C.C. order would undo the idea completely; companies would be allowed to block or demand payment for certain traffic as they liked, as long as they disclosed the arrangements.At the moment, broadband companies are promising not to act unfairly, and they argue that undoing the rules would give them further incentive to invest in their broadband capacity, ultimately improving the internet.Brian Hart, an F.C.C. spokesman, said broadband companies would still be covered by antitrust laws and other rules meant to prevent anticompetitive behavior. He noted that Mr. Pai\u2019s proposals would simply return the network to an earlier, pre-network-neutrality regulatory era.\u201cThe internet flourished under this framework before, and it will again,\u201d he said.Broadband companies are taking a similar line. When I pointed out to a Comcast spokeswoman that the company\u2019s promises were only voluntary \u2014 that nothing will prevent Comcast from one day creating special tiers of internet service with bundled content, much like the way it now sells cable TV \u2014 she suggested I was jumping the gun.Well, O.K. But a vibrant network doesn\u2019t die all at once. It takes time and neglect; it grows weaker by the day, but imperceptibly, so that one day we are living in a digital world controlled by giants and we come to regard the whole thing as normal.It\u2019s not normal. It wasn\u2019t always this way. The internet doesn\u2019t have to be a corporate playground. That\u2019s just the path we\u2019ve chosen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Improving Your \u2018News Diet\u2019: A Three-Step Lesson Plan for Teenagers and Teachers", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by_________What a year the last few days have been, huh?This is news in the era of President Trump. It slaps you awake, follows you around all day, intrudes on your conversations, interrupts your dinner, whispers as you try to sleep.That was six months ago, and the pace this fall has been even more relentless: Political news vied for the front page with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the earthquake in Mexico, nuclear threats from North Korea, the Las Vegas shootings, the attack in Manhattan and more. Add to that the problem of \u201cfake news,\u201d and we certainly understand why anyone might simply want to ignore current events entirely.But in a connected world, information comes at us constantly, whether we choose it or not, and we must each figure out a way to navigate it. Not for a school assignment, but for our real lives.The challenge has three steps:1. Do a personal \u201cnews audit\u201d to observe the role of news in their lives right now.2. Experiment with their \u201cnews diets\u201d in some way to find new sources that address any lacks they found.3. Write a short essay or produce a short video that reflects on the process and what they learned. What did they discover about their news habits before and after they did the challenge \u2014 and what can they say about the role of news in their lives in general?To help teenagers and their teachers approach each of these steps, we have created a kind of lesson plan below. Each section is written directly to students, but each also ends with tips for teachers who may be doing this as a class project.Questions? Let us know in the comments, and thank you for participating._________Be honest with yourself: What does news mean to you? You may not remember a time when the news wasn\u2019t available online, but because it is, a lot of what informs us isn\u2019t necessarily coming from traditional news organizations. News can come from many places \u2014 and sometimes it feels like it\u2019s coming from everywhere all at once.So...is it headlines in a newspaper like The Times or breaking news on CNN? Is it links friends or relatives post in your social feeds, or discussions during lunch or at your dinner table? Is it what you view on Snapchat? What you watch on YouTube? Links your mom shares with you? Threads you follow on Reddit or accounts on Tumblr? Texts from your friends about what people in your school are doing? All of the above?Now think about how news has played a role in your life up until now. Alone or in conversation with others, see if you can come up with an example for each of these...\u2022 A memory from your childhood of hearing important breaking news, and its effect on you and those around you.\u2022 A recent breaking news item that got your attention.\u2022 A time when you were embarrassed not to know about something in the news.\u2022 A time when you used news of some kind to help you in a practical way.\u2022 A time when you felt a personal connection to news about a person, place, event or issue.\u2022 A time you\u2019ve shared a news item, whether via word of mouth, a social feed, email or in any other way.\u2022 A time when news overwhelmed, angered or upset you.\u2022 A time when knowledge of something in the news provided you with \u201csocial currency.\u201d That is, your friends, family or community was interested in it, and knowing about it enriched your relationships or helped you build new ones.Finally, answer the question, \u201cWhy do I want to consume news?\u201d Again, be as honest with yourself as you can. For instance, you might answer:\u2022 I want to be up-to-date on news about a place, group of people, issue or aspect of culture that I care about or am personally connected to.\u2022 I don\u2019t want seem like I don\u2019t know what is going on in the world because it\u2019s embarrassing.\u2022 I want to find \u201cnews I can use\u201d on a specific topic or issue.\u2022 I want to be entertained.\u2022 I feel like following news will help me academically \u2014 or in a future job.I grew increasingly bothered by how up and down the news would make me feel. At times I\u2019d be inspired by a part of the world I would never otherwise have access to. At other times, I felt completely lost following a story I just didn\u2019t have the time or context needed to really get. And at others, I felt numb, in a sort of haze of \u201cI know a little bit about a lot of unpleasant things and have no agency to do anything about them.\u201dStudents could then share some of their answers in small groups and, later define \u201cnews\u201d as a class. Together everyone might come up with a list of reasons people might follow news \u2014 and why they might not.Once you\u2019ve defined for yourself what news means to you and why you want to follow it (or why you\u2019re avoiding it), take 24 to 48 hours to closely observe the information that comes to you right now, and where it comes from.To do this, you might keep a chart of some kind, creating as many columns as you like depending on what you want to observe.But we recommend adding two other columns so that you can better use this chart as a reflective tool. First, a column in which you rate or comment on how reliable you think the information is and why, and second, a column for open-ended comments that you can use to jot down emotional reactions, questions, patterns you notice, or anything else that seems important.Would you like some examples?Now that you\u2019ve spent 24-to 48 hours noticing what news you already follow, think about what would make it better for you. What would you like to add, subtract or change? Why? How can you come up with a mix that will improve your life?Think about things like discovery, time, location, and what you\u2019ll do with the news after you consume it. For example, maybe your biggest problem is that you just don\u2019t know how to find great journalism that you actually care about it because it doesn\u2019t show up in your apps or feeds. Or, maybe you regularly discover interesting things but simply don\u2019t have the time to enjoy it \u2014 because who actually has 45 minutes to read a 5,000-word story on a Tuesday? Or, you may just prefer to read a book or watch a movie when you have free time because they give you that satisfying, relaxing feeling of having a clear beginning, middle and end. In that case, is there a news outlet out there that can give you a neat beginning, middle and end to catch up?Here are some steps you can take. Together they may take you a week or more since you may have to repeat them until the mix feels right.What is missing from my list? What do I have too much of, and what might I not have enough of? What new topics do I want to learn more about? What new sources could I explore? How reliable is the news I\u2019m getting now? How balanced? How representative of a variety of points of view and experiences? How useful for my everyday life?Where should I get my news?Perhaps the best answer, for now, is that you should try to get your news from a variety of sources. Variety here means variety in the media forms you choose and variety in the types of messages you choose. In other words, If you tend to get all of your news from cable television, you might supplement that by adding some newspaper time into the mix, or maybe spend a little bit of time listening to a public radio station to find out what they\u2019re reporting. Likewise, if you tend to get all of your news from one newspaper, you might consider turning on a cable TV news channel occasionally to see how they are presenting some of the stories you\u2019ve been following in print. If the internet is your sole source of news, consider comparing what you read at the websites of major news organizations, with you might read at some blog sites, or on social networking sites like Facebook, or video sites such as YouTube.It\u2019s always good to vary the perspective of your news sources as well. A big part of news literacy is understanding that there really is no such thing as an objective point of view in news, and that all news sources, because of technologies and because of personal, organizational and economic considerations, have their own way of shaping news.So look at the mix of sources in your news audit and experiment with adding new ones that address any imbalances you notice.\u2022 Or, maybe you\u2019ve decided that you\u2019d like to get a global view via more international news \u2014 or, conversely, maybe you\u2019d like to focus more locally, on your own city, town or even neighborhood.\u2022 Is there a topic you\u2019d like to follow in depth \u2014 say, coverage of a particular community, issue or trend? If so, seek out and add sources that will tell you more about that, or compare the ways different sources handle it.\u2022 Or, you might just want to add more \u201cnews you can use\u201d to improve your life \u2014 whether health and nutrition information, news about college, careers or hobbies, or anything else.Assess your list to see if it helps you achieve the goals you set out to achieve. For example, if you want to understand exactly what is happening in Russia and why that country\u2019s relationship with the United States is so complicated, why is over 50% of your news consumption about baseball? Or, if you want to understand someone whose politics are different than yours, are you reading any news sources that they follow to understand their worldview? Do you know anything about the communities where those voters live and how they might be different from your own?You could also invite a range of people from around the school or community to come to class and share their own daily news habits and sources, and encourage students on their own to interview people they respect to find even more. Together, you might create a long list of options in a Google doc which everyone can edit.First, live with your new news diet for a week or so, and notice what happens. Next, reflect on the change.But even if you aren\u2019t doing this for our challenge, thinking about this exercise and what you discovered can help you figure out a healthy way to navigate the stream of news in your life.Here are a few questions to help:\u2022 Where did you start? What did your news audit reveal about your habits and sources and the role of news in your life at the beginning of exercise?\u2022 What happened when you experimented with your news diet? How did it impact your daily life? What stood out from the experience?\u2022 Will you continue to experiment with your news diet? What may be the right mix for you? Why?\u2022 What notable reactions to individual news items or topics did you have along the way?\u2022 What does this exercise leave you noticing, wondering or thinking about the role of news in your life in general? Is the right mix of news making your life better somehow?\u2022 Do you want to do anything with the news you consumed? Share it in an email or on a social feed? Write about it yourself somehow? Get involved in an issue? What could you do?\u2022 What was most notable, useful or interesting about this experience?Then, they might work in groups to share their answers. Please note that we allow submissions from individuals, or from groups of up to five. While writing personal essays might be tricky in a group, group video-making may be a fun way to approach the project. How can they bring their insights together into one piece? How can they show visually what they learned? You might allow students to choose whether they\u2019d like to work alone or in groups, and whether an essay or a video feels more natural.But as we say in the contest rules, we hope students also know that they are allowed to have a sense of humor about the project, and take creative risks of all kinds. We\u2019ve never done a challenge like this before, and we can\u2019t wait to be surprised.Thank you for participating!On Variety in News Sources and Reading News TodayOn Reliability of News Sources_________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Haste on Tax Measures May Leave a Trail of Loopholes", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the rush to \u201cget it done\u201d \u2014 particularly on the business side, where the most sweeping changes are planned \u2014 is alarming tax specialists who warn that new and unforeseen complexity, loopholes and glitches could come back to haunt tax collectors and taxpayers.\u25a0 Rules designed to prevent highly paid doctors, lawyers and other service providers from cashing in on new benefits aimed at small businesses can be easily circumvented.Even those who applaud the aim of reducing the corporate tax rate and transforming the way global profits are taxed worry that specific provisions will miss the mark.Republican leaders, responding to political pressure to move quickly, defend the process, saying Congress has held dozens of hearings on tax reform in recent years.Tax bills, by nature complex, are shaped by a galaxy of competing pressures. And withholding details until the final vote as a way of shielding the legislation from special interests is not a new strategy.We\u2019re asking for your help to identify loopholes, unintended consequences or errors in the Senate and House tax proposals.Yet several veterans of previous tax battles argue what is different this time is the mix of breakneck speed and enormous scope.The Congressional Budget Office said on Monday that Congress\u2019s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has not yet had enough time to analyze the full economic impact of the proposals.Because the switch could end up encouraging American companies to move even more profits offshore to avoid paying any domestic income tax, both the House and Senate versions of the bill impose rules to deter most multinationals with annual revenues of more than $100 million from exploiting such tactics.But the effort to catch the giants under the new territorial system sets a financial bar that small and medium-size businesses can limbo under. Mr. Shay said accounting firms were likely to start marketing off-the-shelf tax shelters allowing companies to set up foreign offices in low-tax countries like Bermuda or Luxembourg to shrink their tax bills.\u201cThey\u2019re just opening us up to the next round of tax shelters on the international side,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the I.R.S., underfunded as it is, isn\u2019t going to be able to check anything.\u201dMultinationals, though, could avoid some of the Gilti tax by shifting more tangible property like production and research facilities abroad.\u201cThere is not a single advantage this has, except for students of people like me, who will get paid more to figure out how to game the system,\u201d he said.Yet enacting a 20 percent corporate tax rate to take effect one year in advance while allowing investors to immediately deduct their expenses at 35 percent operates like a subsidy, and could encourage investing in money-losing projects simply for a tax gain.\u201cThat could lead to silly stuff where you have a loss before the tax, but a gain after the tax,\u201d Mr. Shaviro said.Other experts pointed to constantly shifting cost estimates of proposals that suddenly gained or lost tens of billions of dollars overnight.The shortcomings are fixable to some degree, critics say, but the Republican strategy of pushing through a bill without Democratic votes before the end of the year \u2014 on tax rules that take effect a few weeks later \u2014 will not leave sufficient time.To some supporters, though, that\u2019s the price of success.But there are always technical corrections to tax bills after they pass, Ms. Bernstein said, and retailers have been waiting so long for a corporate rate cut that they don\u2019t mind if it finally happens with an imperfect bill.\u201cIt\u2019s part of how the sausage is made, but it\u2019s better to make this sausage than cut it off,\u201d Ms. Bernstein said.An earlier version of this article described incorrectly a statement from the Congressional Budget Office. The office said that the Joint Committee on Taxation had not yet had enough time to analyze the full impact of the proposals, not that the office expected that it would be unable to analyze the bill before a vote.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTNatalie Kitroeff contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Justice Department Sues to Block AT&T-Time Warner Merger", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner were to go through, the merger would create a media and telecommunications behemoth. By itself, AT&T is one of the nation\u2019s largest internet and telephone providers. With its 2015 acquisition of DirecTV, the country\u2019s largest satellite company, it also became the largest television distributor in the United States.The combined company would have an unrivaled ability to reach consumers through news and entertainment programming. Among Time Warner\u2019s properties are HBO, the home to \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d; Warner Bros., the studio behind blockbusters like \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and the Harry Potter film series; and Turner Broadcasting, which includes the news channel CNN and the sports-heavy TNT network.Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department\u2019s top antitrust regulator, said a union of the two companies would harm consumers and weaken competition.\u201cThis merger would greatly harm American consumers,\u201d Mr. Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in a statement. \u201cIt would mean higher monthly television bills and fewer of the new, emerging innovative options that consumers are beginning to enjoy.\u201dAT&T said it would defend the proposed deal in court, arguing that companies don\u2019t directly compete against each other and that the government hasn\u2019t challenged a similar kind of merger in decades.\u201cIt defies logic, and it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, said in a news conference on Monday after the suit was filed.The complaint was filed in Federal District Court for the District of Columbia against AT&T, DirecTV and Time Warner.In a call with reporters on Monday, a Justice Department official said the agency remained open to negotiating a settlement. To gain favor with the antitrust division, the official said, the companies would have to sell off some of their assets.During the news conference, Mr. Stephenson said that the Justice Department had a long history of approving similar mergers and that the company was not willing to part with any assets to get the deal approved.The government argued further that AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner would stifle innovation from online streaming firms like SlingTV, which competes with AT&T\u2019s DirecTV Now service. AT&T could withhold programs from those online providers.A combined AT&T and Time Warner, the complaint said, would be more harmful to consumers and larger in scope than Comcast-NBCUniversal. Comcast\u2019s cable and broadband service reaches more than one-third of the nation.\u201cBoth AT&T/DirecTV\u2019s video distribution services and Time Warner\u2019s TV networks are available nationwide, so the harm would occur throughout the country,\u201d the Justice Department said in its complaint.Mr. Stephenson has argued that AT&T needs media content in order to compete against internet firms like Google and Facebook for digital advertising dollars. With a big stock of television programming, it would also compete more effectively for subscribers against companies like Comcast and Verizon, which both own content.While speaking with reporters on Monday, Mr. Stephenson obliquely raised the issue of possible interference by the White House. President Trump, a frequent critic of news coverage by CNN, said during the 2016 presidential campaign that the deal should be blocked. Mr. Stephenson called the issue of CNN the \u201celephant in the room\u201d and speculated about its role in Mr. Delrahim\u2019s decision.\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said.Mr. Delrahim has argued that those remedies are not effective. Instead, he has spoken in favor of so-called structural remedies, like forcing a company to sell assets before a merger or acquisition.On Sept. 29, he was put in a position to act on that theory, when he was sworn in at the Justice Department.Throughout the summer, Justice Department officials and AT&T lawyers had discussed conditions that would allay antitrust concerns. During the talks, AT&T representatives said the combined company would abstain from anticompetitive business practices. At least some Justice Department staff members seemed open to the idea, according to two people familiar with the government review.The antitrust staff, which included holdovers from the Obama administration, presented Mr. Delrahim with three options: Accept the deal with conditions, accept the deal with divestitures, or block it altogether.Five weeks later, it became clear to AT&T that the deal was in trouble.Mr. Stephenson and the company\u2019s general counsel flew from Dallas to Washington a few days later to meet with the officials. After the meeting, the two sides were far from reaching a deal.According to AT&T sources, the Justice Department asked the company to rid itself of Turner or DirecTV, the satellite TV provider.Government officials, however, said AT&T had offered to sell CNN. By the end of the day\u2019s talks, Mr. Stephenson put out a statement saying he had never offered to sell CNN.The next day, on Nov. 9, Mr. Stephenson, speaking at The New York Times\u2019s DealBook conference, said the company was prepared to defend itself in court. He added that a significant merger of companies that were not direct competitors with each other had not been challenged in 40 years.In recent weeks, the Justice Department reached out to several state attorneys general who had been investigating the transaction to see if they would join the lawsuit as plaintiffs. None of them have yet joined, leaving the Justice Department as the sole plaintiff.In July, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, wrote a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions that asked, \u201cHas any employee of the White House or adviser to the president (either official or unofficial) had any contact with any Department of Justice employee regarding the AT&T/Time Warner transaction?\u201dMr. Delrahim has strongly denied there has been interference by the White House or Mr. Trump.Legal experts were divided on the merits of the suit.Gene Kimmelman, the president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group and a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, said, \u201cWe believe the Justice Department has presented a persuasive case that should satisfy any federal judge that this transaction is illegal and should be blocked, regardless of any politics surrounding the deal.\u201dRyan Radia, a legal and regulatory expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, took a different view. \u201cThe AT&T-Time Warner merger is a vertical transaction that wouldn\u2019t reduce competition in any distinct market,\u201d Mr. Radia said. \u201cUnder established antitrust principles, the government will have a difficult time showing a court that the deal is likely to harm consumers.\u201dAnxiety over the merger has simmered in the CNN newsroom for months, with staff members speculating about the role of the president\u2019s animosity toward the network. On Monday, CNN anchors reminded viewers that Mr. Trump had once tweeted a video that portrayed him body-slamming a wrestler with a CNN logo for a head.AT&T\u2019s general counsel, David R. McAtee, said in a statement on Monday: \u201cToday\u2019s D.O.J. lawsuit is a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent. We are confident that the court will reject the government\u2019s claims and permit this merger under longstanding legal precedent.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated which cable news networks broadcast AT&T\u2019s news conference on Monday.

{"Headline": "Skype Vanishes From App Stores in China, Including Apple\u2019s", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 One of the last foreign-run tools for online communication in China appears to be in trouble with the authorities here.For almost a month, Skype, the internet phone call and messaging service, has been unavailable on a number of sites where apps are downloaded in China, including Apple\u2019s app store in the country.\u201cWe have been notified by the Ministry of Public Security that a number of voice over internet protocol apps do not comply with local law. Therefore these apps have been removed from the app store in China,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said Tuesday in an emailed statement responding to questions about Skype\u2019s disappearance from the app store. \u201cThese apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201dThe removal led to a volley of complaints from Chinese users on internet message boards who were no longer able to pay for Skype\u2019s services through Apple. The users said that the disruption began in late October.Skype, which is owned by Microsoft, still functions in China, and its fate in the country is not yet clear. But its removal from the app stores is the most recent example of a decades-long push by China\u2019s government to control and monitor the flow of information online.While China has long wielded the most sophisticated and comprehensive internet controls in the world, under President Xi Jinping it has upped the ante, squelching most major foreign social networks and messaging apps one at a time.Beijing appears to have disabled these apps because they generally feature encryption options that make messages harder for the government to monitor. Such products also often run afoul of government rules that require the use of real-name identification for each and every account.A Microsoft spokesman said that Skype had been \u201ctemporarily removed\u201d from Apple\u2019s store and that the company was \u201cworking to reinstate the app as soon as possible.\u201d But the spokesman did not address Skype\u2019s absence from a variety of major third-party Android app stores. Because Google\u2019s services are largely blocked in China, Android users revert to alternate stores for downloads, and Skype\u2019s main app was not available on popular ones run by Chinese tech giants like Huawei and Xiaomi.But a key Chinese Communist Party meeting had already ended when Skype disappeared from the app stores \u2014 an indication that the cybersecurity law was the reason, and that the law, which began to take effect in June, is likely to have a deep and long-lasting impact on how the internet works in China. While the rules do not specifically ban foreign messaging apps, they do include general language that could be used to justify crackdowns.\u201cA broad reading of provisions in the law could be taken to mean that there is no longer support for allowing unfettered access to foreign communications tools such as Skype, WhatsApp, Signal and others that are outside the direct control of Chinese authorities,\u201d said Paul Triolo, the head of global technology at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.\u201cHence these also come under pressure, and are increasingly being throttled or blocked,\u201d he said.In that case, as in this one, it said that the apps violated Chinese rules and that it had taken them down to comply. Apple said this year that it planned to open a data center in China, also in response to China\u2019s new internet laws, which require that such centers be within the country\u2019s borders.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Dangerous Sprint Into the Future", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "To hear its executives tell it, Tesla is misunderstood because it is still perceived as a car manufacturer, when its goals are more complex and far-reaching. But at least some people have bought into these grand ambitions. This summer, Tesla\u2019s stock-market valuation at times rose above those of Ford and General Motors, and its worth exceeded $60 billion. It did not seem to matter to investors that the company had never made an annual profit, had missed its production targets repeatedly and had become enmeshed in controversy over its self-driving \u201cautopilot\u201d technologies, or that Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, had conceded that the value of his company, of which he owns about 22 percent, was \u201chigher than we have the right to deserve.\u201d Tesla was a headlong bet on the future, a huge wager on the idea of a better world. And its secretive Gigafactory was the arsenal for a full-fledged attack on the incumbent powers of the car and fossil-fuel industries. The factory would help validate Musk and his company\u2019s seriousness about leading humanity\u2019s turn to greener technologies, with a vision now encompassing solar roofing tiles and battery packs for home and industry. Most crucial, it involved producing millions of Tesla cars and trucks, all of which would be sleek, electric and self-driving.If ambitions were all it took, Tesla would be crowned the colossus of the global car industry. But rapidly accelerating new technologies have brought uncertainty as well. Automakers are encountering three destabilizing forces all at once: automation, electrification and sharing. And sizing up which companies will be the winners and losers in their wakes is in no way obvious. In terms of self-driving cars, it seems likely that long-established companies \u2014 General Motors and Ford, as well as BMW and Audi \u2014 will benefit from their substantial reserves of cash and deep manufacturing experience. Because these automakers can invest deeply in research (and spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy start-ups), they can remain competitive with companies less inherently cautious, like Tesla and Waymo, the spinoff of Google\u2019s self-driving projects.Tesla\u2019s goal has always been focused on going green, rather than creating the driverless future. (Its mission is emblazoned on its factory walls: \u201cTo accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.\u201d) Yet as the automobile industry settles on the consensus that self-driving cars are coming \u2014 their promise to improve safety and to help ride-sharing replace car ownership for many Americans propels their inevitability \u2014 Tesla finds itself in the midst of a contest to do both. This set of challenges should be enough for any company, especially one led by a chief executive whose time is compromised by other business commitments as a founder of a rocket company (SpaceX), a new tunneling operation (the Boring Company), a company planning a human-computer interface (Neuralink) and a nonprofit focused on the dangers of artificial intelligence (OpenAI). But Tesla has given itself a few others too. One is to essentially reinvent modern manufacturing processes at the Gigafactory. Yet another is to create the first mass-market electric car ever. In the meantime, a company that has never made much profit needs to somehow figure out how to do so \u2014 that is, to put itself in the black before financial losses and missed deadlines curdle any hope that Tesla inspires, among customers or stockholders, into skepticism.Still, the Gigafactory is considerably more than a battery factory: It\u2019s the physical embodiment of various technological breakthroughs the company \u2014 which just manufactured its 250,000th car \u2014 is trying to bring to its cars and energy-storage systems. Tesla makes motors here for its new Model 3 car, for instance, which are then trucked to its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., 240 miles away. When we went inside, after a labyrinthine walk through offices and up and down stairways, we reached a rapidly moving automated factory line, where batteries were being installed into Powerwalls and Powerpacks \u2014 the residential and industrial units that store energy collected from solar panels (or any electrical generator). Later in the month, devices like these would make their way to Puerto Rico, where Tesla rebuilt the power infrastructure for a children\u2019s hospital, and southern Australia, where the company is involved in a vast public project to shore up the country\u2019s electrical grid. \u201cWe think of this building as a product, because it is a product,\u201d my guide told me as we walked alongside a production line. Every machine had been scrutinized, every inch mapped out, every efficiency contemplated. Tesla had taken the highly unusual step of setting up a separate entity to take full control of the building\u2019s design, engineering and construction, reflecting Tesla\u2019s D.I.Y. ethos to achieve levels of vertical ownership and quality control that its executives believe are unreachable otherwise. The company had even concocted its own Tesla blend of coffee to serve near its cafeterias. \u201cIf we cannot get exactly what we want from the world,\u201d one executive told me, \u201cthen we have to go do it ourselves.\u201dTesla\u2019s grand plans in many respects depend on how much innovation the company can bring to the process of battery making. If the Gigafactory succeeds in reducing costs \u2014 one battery-industry analyst, Sam Jaffe, the director at Cairn Energy Research Advisors, told me he thinks the company should be able to drive down the price of its cells by 30 percent \u2014 multiple dividends will accrue to Tesla. Cheaper batteries mean more than cheaper cars. They mean Tesla can put larger battery packs into cars for the same cost, increasing the vehicles\u2019 range, power and appeal compared with the competition. At the same time, they could make its home energy-storage systems more efficient. Tesla could also gain an advantage in the race to produce autonomous vehicles, or A.V.s. The electric vehicles, or E.V.s, that Tesla wants to make autonomous have zero emissions. If self-driving cars go on rotation, say, in Uber and Lyft fleets, they could run 24-7, possibly leading to more cars on the road. \u201cOne of the concerns about automation is that it\u2019s going to drastically increase the miles we drive,\u201d Stephen Zoepf, the executive director at the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, told me. \u201cSo if we expect as a society that we\u2019re going to be driving a lot more, we obviously want to mitigate the environmental impact.\u201dAt the Gigafactory, J.B. Straubel, a Tesla founder and the company\u2019s chief technology officer, recounted the plant\u2019s origin story. In 2012, he did a back-of-the-envelope calculation and realized that if Tesla were to sell something on the order of 500,000 cars a year, it would require the world\u2019s entire output of lithium-ion batteries at the time. \u201cWe realized, holy crap, this means we need a huge factory,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause there was no way to do this just by putting in an order with some cell company and have them ship a few more.\u201d His projections were not far off. When we met in September, orders for the Model 3, which began production in midyear and has been billed as the company\u2019s first mass-market car, were around 455,000 through July, suggesting that the demand for E.V.s is far larger than any of the traditional automakers ever imagined. In the future, Straubel told me, Tesla plans to put up many more Gigafactories around the world, \u201cones that are actually quite a lot bigger than this one\u201d \u2014 and it would construct those itself too. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a big building that\u2019s full of equipment,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea here of the machine that builds the machine, and it\u2019s really true. This place is the embodiment of that.\u201dThe impression he wanted me to have, I think, was that Tesla, once it gets this prodigious machine humming, will become robotically unstoppable at cranking out smaller machines, a great big clean-energy perpetual-motion device. At the same time, the company\u2019s executives, from Straubel and Musk on down, were urging potential customers not to view each Tesla product in isolation but as parts of an ecosystem. The Tesla customer could soon use Tesla solar roof tiles during the day to charge up a Tesla Powerwall unit, filled with Gigafactory-made batteries \u2014 at night the Powerwall could in turn recharge the Tesla sedan. Perhaps the customer very much liked to drive? In that case, he or she might occasionally stop at one of the hundreds of Tesla \u201csupercharger\u201d stations in cities or along highways. Or maybe the owner didn\u2019t like to drive at all and preferred to be driven automatically. Tesla would soon straddle our peculiar moment, the transitional era where humans begin to take their hands off their machines. \u201cEvery car made since October of last year,\u201d Musk promised in early August, \u201cis capable of full autonomy, we believe.\u201dField quickly showed me the controls. There weren\u2019t many except for a few dials on the steering wheel. The screen to its right served as the car\u2019s dashboard. \u201cThis looks forward to an era of autonomy,\u201d Field explained, \u201cbut it\u2019s also simpler and easier to manufacture.\u201d That meant cheaper too, which was crucial: Tesla had concluded that every dollar saved on the cost of making the car would mean 100 more families could buy it in a year. As we drove through Palo Alto, the car was nimble and responsive, with the same kind of leaping acceleration that characterizes the Model S. But it took some time to get used to checking the screen to my right for my speed and autopilot settings. Field told me his team had concluded that it would be natural and intuitive for a younger generation. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting when you put young people in the car,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the way all kids navigate technology.\u201d It\u2019s also possible that the kids might do more navigating, or giving the car orders, than driving. Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla\u2019s design chief, later told me that in creating the car\u2019s interior, he faced the question of making a car that was affordable and stylish but also relevant for a future era. There was vigorous debate within the company about what to do if the Model 3 became truly autonomous. As time went on, von Holzhausen\u2019s group reasoned, this car would be driven less and would be driving more. Thus the decision to jettison dials and controls made sense, because the need for driver information would be reduced, and the central screen could mark routes and arrival times and double as an entertainment center. Those would be the essential tools. Or, as von Holzhausen put it, \u201cThe screen then became the hero of the vehicle.\u201dAll of Tesla\u2019s cars, including the Model 3, come with cameras and sensors; the sensors are small radar and ultrasonic devices situated around the car\u2019s exterior that could enable it, presuming the right software is eventually developed, to become self-driving. Because each Tesla car maintains a cellular connection, over-the-air improvements dispensed by the company are a regular feature \u2014 tweaking acceleration or braking capabilities through uploaded instructions, for instance. Sometimes the extent to which the company can improve or alter its cars\u2019 performance, even years after they left the factory, can be startling or unsettling, as was the case when Tesla temporarily extended the battery range for some drivers fleeing Hurricane Irma in Florida this summer. Self-driving, which Field assured me would ultimately come to pass with the right software and which Musk has repeatedly promoted to investors and customers, would allow Teslas to become something much more than they are. In the parlance of the Society of Automotive Engineers, which has quantified the capabilities a car must have to be considered self-driving, the vehicles will have nearly attained Level 5. This level denotes a safe and fully autonomous car that can operate in any place, and any conditions, without a driver.At the moment, Teslas are at Level 2. Their cameras, sensors and software support a more modest capability known as \u201cenhanced autopilot,\u201d which costs an additional $5,000 in a new Model S or Model 3. In certain road and weather conditions, the cars can regulate speed and braking in traffic, steer automatically, change lanes and parallel park autonomously. By some industry rankings, these features now help make Teslas among the safest cars on the road. But following the deadly crash of a Model S driver who was using autopilot in Florida in May 2016, the company reconfigured what the cars permit. When I tried the automated steering on my Model S during the drive from Reno to Palo Alto, for instance, the car chimed frequently in distress and warned me through a dashboard notice when I took my hands off the wheel for a few seconds. I\u2019d been informed that if this happened three times, the car would slow down, stop and rescind my autopilot privileges altogether. I didn\u2019t push it. Clearly, the car \u2014 and Tesla, too \u2014 still needed its driver.In the summer of 2016, Musk updated his vision for the company \u2014 \u201cMaster Plan, Part Deux.\u201d In the decade since Part 1, the acceptance of electric vehicles had grown to the point where some traditional carmakers, in a surprising turn, were beginning to speak of an inevitable transition to an era when all models were battery-powered. Entire countries (like China) and enormous markets (like California) were also considering eventual bans on internal-combustion engines. As E.V. technology seemed ascendant, a variety of factors outside the auto industry were creating real potential for self-driving vehicles: great gains in computer-processing power, cheaper hardware sensors, better mobile connectivity, advances in artificial intelligence and enhanced mapping software. In his updated master plan, Musk stated that every Tesla would now have self-driving capabilities and that the application of \u201cfleet learning\u201d \u2014 a variation on machine learning \u2014 would help the company someday deliver a car that was 10 times safer in self-driving mode than when controlled by a human.Musk also explained a new fundamental goal of the company. Tesla, he said, wanted to \u201cenable your car to make money for you when you aren\u2019t using it.\u201d In other words, any new Tesla could in due time be part of a sharing network, able to taxi strangers around while its owner worked, slept or did whatever. Most Americans\u2019 cars stay parked about 95 percent of the time. A Tesla would not. In the same way that Tesla\u2019s electric drive train made the American car more efficient, the Tesla network would make the total utilization of the vehicle more efficient, too.App-based sharing networks for cars already exist: These companies \u2014 Turo and Getaround, for instance \u2014 are different from, say, Zipcar, because they depend on peer-to-peer communications to arrange for rentals. In essence, they function like mobile Airbnbs, and in some cases have drawn the ire of users in the wake of driver crashes and insurance issues. A Tesla network would push this concept much further, involving perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of cars, all of them already connected to the internet. Yet such a business network, one Tesla executive told me, most likely wouldn\u2019t succeed unless Tesla\u2019s cars were fully autonomous. Any concerns about insurance and lending a car to a risky driver would disappear, he argued, if autonomous driving proves to be much safer than manual driving. Just as important, autonomy makes irrelevant the problem of getting the car to where it\u2019s needed next \u2014 it can be sent wherever it needs to go via mobile app. What\u2019s crucial here is that the Tesla network, if it becomes functional, can defray the cost of an electric car like the Model 3, which is billed as Tesla\u2019s affordable car but can easily surpass $50,000 with various options. If your car is making money for you when you\u2019re not using it, it effectively becomes a tool that uses the virtues of A.V.s to promote the market adoption of E.V.s.Over the course of several months, I often asked people at Tesla, as well as those working on autonomous technologies elsewhere, how far away the self-driving future might be. There was no solid consensus beyond somewhere between two and five years. I tended to believe that the timeline might extend much further and would depend on how tightly we regulate such vehicles and how we agree to define autonomy. Does it mean interstate driving on a sunny day? Or driving within a dedicated area on city streets? Is it a Level 5 overnight trip through heavy rain from Boston to Washington? A driverless taxi pickup on a crowded street under partial construction \u2014 orange cones, backhoes, chaos \u2014 as a nightclub lets out? Part of the debate concerns hardware and whether the collection of sensors that automotive engineers now build into their A.V.s can collect enough data to create a fully autonomous car. These sensors generally include radar, cameras and Lidar, the expensive laser-based technology that Tesla has so far declined to use. Many other A.V. researchers consider it essential. Lidar uses light waves, rather than radio waves, to map and \u201cread\u201d a car\u2019s environs.Musk has promised that before the end of this year, a Tesla vehicle will drive itself coast to coast completely on autopilot. A number of competitors \u2014 especially Waymo and General Motors \u2014 seem to be closing in on similarly ambitious goals. But it\u2019s worth noting that no Level 5 car has ever been publicly deployed, and it\u2019s doubtful one even exists; the coast-to-coast trip on autopilot, Musk suggested, wouldn\u2019t yet be an instance where a driver could, say, go to sleep at the wheel. What\u2019s more, no Level 4 car, where the vehicle is self-driving under certain weather and geographical conditions, has been put in regular service, either. In fact, while driver-assistance tools like autopilot can greatly reduce crash rates, no company or researcher has ever demonstrated that a robotic automobile can consistently operate in the everyday world more safely than a car with a human driver.An executive close to Musk told me that his boss believes that creating a true A.V. is a \u201csolvable\u201d problem, one probably less difficult than others he has encountered in various business endeavors \u2014 for instance, creating cheap, reusable rockets for SpaceX, his other major company, or pushing Tesla\u2019s Model S to such unlikely success. This may indeed prove true. But unlike other tech innovations, the development of driverless cars cannot count on something like Moore\u2019s Law, which has projected a doubling of computing power at regular intervals and has allowed Silicon Valley entrepreneurs a clear window into the future. Based on conversations with engineers on the A.V. front lines, the most difficult problem is rigging cars with sensors and software that can take a rich, clear, picture of every element in the surrounding environment \u2014 people, bikes, signs, obstacles \u2014 and then algorithmically choreograph the future.This challenge is as arduous for Tesla as it is for engineers everywhere working to solve it. And yet the exigencies of Tesla\u2019s business model add an additional layer of complexity. To reach its sustainability goals and become profitable, the company must make lots of cars that are electric and sporty and increasingly affordable; meanwhile, to prepare for the future, Tesla has to build cars that eventually won\u2019t need us. Some of the most experienced researchers working on A.V.s believe that these are two separate and possibly irreconcilable ambitions and that it makes more sense to focus on a pure driverless car, even if it proves to be a very expensive proposition at first, rather than follow Tesla\u2019s incrementalist policy, which would involve rolling out software on a regular basis until the driver does less and less and finally nothing at all. With the second approach, one Silicon Valley engineer said, \u201cthe market pressures that are going to be applied to those technologies mean that you\u2019re not going to climb up the safety and reliability curve\u201d to build a true A.V. Keeping the vehicle affordable is in constant tension with making the vehicle autonomous. Musk\u2019s optimism alone can\u2019t change that.Musk declined my interview requests over the course of several months. By early November, the number of Model 3 cars coming out of the factory had fallen far short of what Musk had promised, the company\u2019s stock price had taken a nose-dive and there appeared to be serious software and robotic glitches at the Gigafactory. Musk was said to be too busy to talk, which did not always square with his social-media postings: jokes, poems, photos of tunnels he was digging, links to stories about the dangers of artificial intelligence and, in one instance, footage of a camping excursion on the roof of the Gigafactory.The company\u2019s evasiveness and secrecy extended to self-driving cars, a subject it was unwilling to discuss in any detail. One Tesla engineer I spoke with, who works on autopilot systems, maintained that the company\u2019s camera and sensory hardware will prove good enough to get his team where it wants to go, which as a near-term goal means cars with a self-driving capability that is twice as good as a human driver (rather than 10 times as good, per the second master plan). By November, Musk was telling investors that the actual goal was to get the system simply on a par with a human driver and that that might require a more powerful computer in the cars, which Tesla would swap in free if necessary. Some customers have already paid $3,000 for a Tesla \u201cself-driving\u201d package (on top of the $5,000 for \u201cenhanced autopilot\u201d), based on Musk\u2019s assurances that the new cars have all the hardware necessary and will be autonomous once regulations and functional software are worked out.There\u2019s no clear indication of whether these efforts are on track, and in the past year, several engineers who ran Tesla\u2019s autopilot unit have left the company. In early October, Scott Miller, an executive involved with General Motors\u2019 self-driving efforts, charged publicly that Musk was \u201cfull of crap\u201d for claiming that his cars could offer self-driving capabilities with their current hardware. His assertions echo those of some other Tesla critics I spoke with: Without Lidar, or a more expensive hardware approach, Musk\u2019s cars may be at a significant disadvantage. Indeed, several people familiar with the company\u2019s A.V. work viewed its self-driving approach as a perilous one, given that there is no definitive way to predict how long it could take Tesla to satisfy the promises made to customers. In the best case, if A.I. and software breakthroughs ultimately transform cars like the Model 3 into self-driving vehicles, Musk will have pulled off something that perhaps seems impossible today. In the worst case, hundreds of thousands of owners will have cars that won\u2019t achieve the status of true A.V.s and can only hope that the sharing network of the master plan will someday become a reality.Tesla\u2019s setbacks, Musk noted in November, shouldn\u2019t eclipse the fact that the company has already grown faster by some measures than Ford when it rolled out the Model T in the early 1900s. He takes a longer view of his business than Wall Street analysts. In a recent TED interview, while discussing his plans for cities on Mars, he argued that it\u2019s a mistake to assume that technology gets better as time goes on. \u201cIt does not automatically improve,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade.\u201d He cited the Egyptian pyramids and Roman aqueducts and how the knowledge to build them was lost for hundreds, or even thousands, of years afterward. The relevance is striking in a time when the federal government would rather subsidize the growth of the coal and fossil-fuel industries than renewable energy and electric cars.Long before anyone saw Tesla as a legitimate player in the auto industry, Musk also appears to have understood that in taking chances that no established carmaker would, Tesla could be an innovative force to quicken our slow, plodding progress in transportation. Imagine Tesla didn\u2019t exist, Steve Jurvetson told me. \u201cWhat would the world look like? I have this sinking suspicion it wouldn\u2019t look that different than 10 years ago. A bunch of hybrid cars. A bunch of noise about hydrogen vehicles. You know, I don\u2019t think the world would look anything like today \u2014 where entire nations are saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to stop making gas cars.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe company\u2019s impact, real and potential, is all the more surprising considering that Musk has staked Tesla\u2019s success on the industrial equivalent of a shoestring, lacking the resources of established carmakers. He has used customer revenue, his own wealth, venture capital, bank and government loans, investments by other automakers and the American stock and debt markets to effectively fund a multibillion-dollar research-and-development project. In that way, he has led the industry to the start of a new era. And now his company, hindered by debilitating manufacturing bottlenecks and its extravagant promises of self-driving, is poised to find out whether, in laying the groundwork for an electric and autonomous future, he took one risk too many.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Old-Fashioned Tools Remain Key for Reporting", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Emily Steel, a media reporter for The Times in New York, discussed the tech she is using.This sounds completely old-fashioned, but the most important tech tool for all of my reporting really has been the telephone. I\u2019ve spoken with dozens upon dozens of sources, many of whom are hesitant to talk about their experiences or may even be barred from sharing information with me. I\u2019ve found that talking over the phone \u2014 and even better meeting in person \u2014 helps to build trust and establish a relationship.What do you like about Signal, and what could be better?I love how easy the app is to use. It is very similar to chatting via iMessage. You basically download and go.That being said, a couple of areas could use some improvement. The calling function is sometimes spotty. And it also would be nice to know whether someone has taken a screenshot of a message if it is set to disappear after viewing.Right now, we\u2019re seeing a very competitive race among the streaming services as they all attempt to distinguish themselves to consumers. One way to do that is through opening up their checkbooks and ramping up the investment in original programming. The money is flowing!Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?I\u2019m getting married next year, so during breaks in reporting I am deep in the world of wedding planning. I\u2019ve found that a lot of the wedding websites and apps are completely overwhelming. I\u2019m signed into one that put more than 100 items on my to-do list!But my fianc\u00e9, Dan, and I also have managed to find some cool sites and apps that have streamlined the process and allowed us to add some of our own personal touches.One was a site called Postable, which allowed us to quickly collect our guests\u2019 addresses and update our address book before sending out our save-the-dates. It was much easier than a series of emails and texts requesting people\u2019s details.After a bit of research, we also used the site Minted to turn a photo of Dan\u2019s artwork into a save-the-date postcard. It turned out great! (We also built a wedding website with Minted.)Like many brides, I\u2019ve also spent an extraordinary amount of time on Pinterest, collecting and curating ideas. Our amazing florist has created a special board to help us brainstorm flowers for the big day.And my other favorite technology of the moment is the app called 1 Second Everyday, which creates a video diary out of one-second video clips. Dan and I thought it would be a special way to track the year before our wedding.Before I worked at The Times, I wrote pretty extensively about the pervasiveness of online tracking technologies. As a result, I\u2019m fairly cautious about what technologies, apps and services I use. Even though Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google Home have taken off in the past year, I don\u2019t want a device that can listen to me all the time in my home. But I did want to be able to turn the lights on and off on command, so I bought an old-fashioned Clapper. It\u2019s a little temperamental, but I still love it!As a media reporter, what is your media setup at home? Are you a cord cutter?Because I\u2019m in front of a screen all day, I try to unplug a bit when I\u2019m at home.

{"Headline": "Getting the House Ready for Winter", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis fall has been a balmy one, but winter is coming. For homeowners living in colder climates, the waning hours of daylight signal the time to start readying the home for snowy days and bitter nights ahead.Even seasoned homeowners, however, can fall behind. With such an unusually warm autumn, Ms. Levy, an associate broker with Halstead, forgot to schedule an appointment to have her boiler serviced before she expects to turn it on. Now the maintenance company is booked until late November. \u201cSo I screwed up there,\u201d she said.Neglect the chores entirely, though, and you could find yourself with a hefty repair bill or a furnace that peters out on a frigid January night \u2014 and probably in the middle of a three-day weekend, because isn\u2019t that when things usually go awry? Forget to clean the gutters, and ice could build up, damaging your roof. Drafty windows and doors could send your heating bill soaring.For first-time homeowners like Anthony and Melissa Campagna, who moved from an apartment in Long Island City, Queens, to a four-bedroom house in West Orange, N.J., in March, preparing for the first winter is a daunting task. What is a boiler, anyway? And what do you do with it other than crank up the thermostat?Buying a house \u201cwas very exciting, but somewhat overwhelming,\u201d said Mr. Campagna, 31, who works in finance. \u201cHaving lived in a condo association, I didn\u2019t have to take care of stuff much.\u201dStill, you need to know what to do \u2014 from the roof down to the basement, and out to the backyard. Here is how to get started.CHECK THE EXTERIORStart by giving the outside of your house a checkup. Walk around the perimeter and look for cracks in the siding or peeling paint. Are the windowsills in good condition? Check the roof for missing or broken tiles. Fix problems while the days are still relatively warm. After a rainstorm, walk around the house and look for any signs that water might not be draining properly, like pooling water or damaged gutters or downspouts.THE GUTTERS Of all the fall chores, cleaning the gutters and downspouts is among the most critical. Your gutters direct water away from your roof and siding, and down into the drainage system. Clogged gutters can cause your roof to leak and lead to ice dams in cold weather. So clean them or hire someone to do the job after the leaves fall. \u201cWhen the gutters aren\u2019t kept clean, the moisture just sits on the rooftop,\u201d said Dina Dwyer-Owens, a co-chair of the board of directors of the Dwyer Group, a parent company of home-repair franchises including Mr. Handyman and Mr. Rooter.Just don\u2019t do the work too soon. Clean the gutters before the last of the leaves fall, and you could find yourself back up on that ladder a few weeks later. \u201cI think I did it a little too early,\u201d said Mr. Campagna of West Orange, N.J., who rushed to clean his gutters before Mrs. Campagna, 30, gave birth to their first child in October. \u201cThat was a rookie mistake.\u201d And a wasted Saturday afternoon.THE WINDOWS AND DOORSIf you have window air-conditioning units, take them out and store them until next summer. But handle those unwieldy appliances with care to avoid injury.Or you could leave them in place. Ms. Levy of Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, covers the outside of her window units with an insulated sheath and wedges towels between the sill and the unit to keep drafts out.Next, swap out screens for storm doors and windows. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we automatically do when it starts getting cold out,\u201d Ms. Levy said. While you\u2019re changing out the screens for glass, check your windows and doors for drafts. Add weather stripping or caulk wherever cold air seeps in.SMOKE ALARMSTHE CHIMNEYHeat, smoke and dangerous gases from your fireplace and heating system travel up your chimney and out of your house, keeping the air inside breathable. A dirty chimney could affect air quality and also pose a fire hazard.THE HEATING SYSTEMIf you were going on a long road trip, you would get your car tuned up before you started your journey, not afterward. The same goes for your heating system. Call a plumber or a furnace repair company to prepare your boiler or furnace for winter before the cold weather arrives.THE PIPESNo one wants a frozen pipe, so keep an eye on yours. Drain the outside water faucets and shut them off before the first freeze. On very cold nights, open cabinets beneath the sink to let warm air in and, if you are especially worried about freezing pipes, let a slow drip of water run through them. Resist the urge to turn down the thermostat to save money \u2013 you want to keep the pipes warm. Extreme weather \u201cis not a time to start trying to save on your energy bill,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cCrank your heat up during those weeks.\u201dPUT THE GARDEN TO BED By November, you may not be thinking much about your hydrangeas, but they still need you. Prune your shrubs and hedges now. Cut foliage away from the house so that ice or snow on the branches won\u2019t damage your siding or let water into your home.THE PATIOEmpty ceramic pots of soil and store them in your garage or basement for the winter so they do not crack in freezing temperatures. Drain the hoses and store them, too. Shut down the sprinkler system and call the pool maintenance company to close up your pool, if you have one. But wait for a crisp sunny to day to cover patio furniture \u2014 you don\u2019t want to trap any moisture under the tarp.STOCK UP ON FIREWOODBRACE FOR WINTER WEATHERIf you have a snowblower, check it. You may need to have it serviced, and many local repair companies will pick up and drop off a blower as part of the service. \u201cStart it up, run it for a couple of minutes and make sure it\u2019s O.K.,\u201d said Rich Janow, 74, who has lived in a six-bedroom house in South Orange, N.J., for 32 years with his wife, Nancy Chiller Janow, 64. \u201cDo it now so that if you have a problem and you need the repair people to fix it, you have enough time before the really bad weather sets in.\u201dIf the winter is a snowy one, use a roof rake to remove excess snow from your roof, and stay on the lookout for ice dams, accumulations of ice and snow along your eaves that could damage your gutters, roof and siding.STAY ON TRACKSoon enough, it\u2019ll be time for spring cleanup.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia-Financed Ad Linked Clinton and Satan", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRussia-linked actors created accounts with names like Blacktivists and Back the Badge aimed at voters concerned about police relations with their communities, and other accounts that called for secure borders that were aimed at immigration hard-liners. One account, Army of Jesus, published an illustration of an arm-wrestling match between Christ and the devil. \u201cSatan: If I win, Clinton wins!\u201d the headline read.The sampling of ads, some of which had been made public earlier, came during a second day of hearings with the top lawyers for Facebook, Twitter and Google and were intended to show the executives how pervasively Russia used their platforms to further its campaign of misinformation. Lawmakers of both parties expressed frustration with answers that fell short of what they had hoped and insisted that the companies, long the darlings of American technology, do better.\u201cI must say, I don\u2019t think you get it,\u201d said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who was also at the first hearing a day earlier. \u201cI went home last night with profound disappointment. I asked specific questions, I got vague answers.\u201dFacebook, Google and Twitter said their general counsels were best equipped to dive into policy and legal questions. But counsels\u2019 appearances on Capitol Hill also allowed the companies\u2019 chief executives to escape high-profile scrutiny.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that you\u2019re here, and not your C.E.O.s,\u201d said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine.Lawmakers also complained that the companies had taken months to acknowledge Russia\u2019s interference on their sites.Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, spent Wednesday at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., talking to investors and analysts as they reported blockbuster quarterly earnings. The stocks of both Google and Facebook, which faced the most criticism in the hearings, are at record highs.During the earnings call, Mr. Zuckerberg was unequivocal in his stance on the issue of Russian meddling in the election.\u201cI\u2019ve expressed how upset I am that the Russians used our tools to sow mistrust,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said, noting that Facebook\u2019s profits will probably be affected by the amount of money the company will spend fighting abuse of its platform. Facebook said it plans to double the number of content reviewers it employs, to 20,000, and will try to add a greater degree of transparency into its advertising system.\u201cWhat they did is wrong, and we\u2019re not going to stand for it,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.The tech companies also provided new numbers on the reach of Russia\u2019s influence campaign. Facebook said an estimated 150 million users of its main site and its subsidiary, Instagram, were exposed to the posts, a larger figure than it provided even as recently as Monday.During the last of the three hearings, members of the House Intelligence Committee spoke in front of posters displaying the content, complaining that it was divisive.Representative Andr\u00e9 Carson, Democrat of Indiana, said an account called Being Patriotic, which amassed 200,000 followers, pushed out content that \u201ccynically exploits grieving officers and their loved ones in order to pit Americans concerned about our law enforcement personnel against Americans concerned about African-American lives lost during police encounters.\u201dThe account was created by the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency.\u201cMy concern is that a dictator like Vladimir Putin abused flaws in our social media platforms to inject the worst kind of identity politics into the voting decisions of at least 100 million Americans,\u201d Mr. Carson said, referring to the Russian president.Ms. Sewell cited figures showing few blacks in Facebook\u2019s work force and its leadership \u2014 a lack of diversity that she said made it hard to believe that those reviewing socially divisive ads could spot problematic posts.While the lawyers showed humility and promised to beef up security and improve technology to prevent foreign interference in elections, they admitted they could not guarantee they would prevent future intrusions. Google\u2019s general counsel, Kent Walker, said the company would work on creating new technologies to detect foreign actors and misinformation on its site. All three said they would build artificial intelligence tools to combat fake and problematic content.\u201cA lot of folks, including many in the media, have tried to reduce this entire conversation down to one premise: Foreign actors conducted a surgically executed covert operation to help elect a United States president,\u201d said Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, emphasized that the real intent of Russian propaganda was to broadly spread misinformation and create chaos.\u201cThese operations \u2014 while we\u2019re talking about the 2016 presidential race \u2014 they\u2019re not limited to 2016, and they were not limited to the presidential race, and they continue to this day,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are much more widespread than one election.\u201dBut the difference in their emphasis on Wednesday also underscored the political realities buffeting their work. In advancing an investigation tied to Mr. Trump, Mr. Burr has been careful to make clear that the committee\u2019s work is larger than an individual candidate, and he has repeatedly tried to tamp down expectations about what it might find.Democrats did not have such reticence.\u201cWhether the Russians and the campaign coordinated these efforts, we do not yet know, but it is true that the Russians mounted what could be described as an independent expenditure campaign on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, also took aim at Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissal of the role of Russia-linked social media in his win. Mr. Heinrich challenged Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, to acknowledge such content and the role that fake accounts linked to Russia and other misinformation had in the election.Mr. Stretch said no. \u201cThe existence of those ads were on Facebook,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was not a hoax.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Young Again: How One Cell Turns Back Time", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatterNone of us was made from scratch. Every human being develops from the fusion of two cells, an egg and a sperm, that are the descendants of other cells. The lineage of cells that joins one generation to the next \u2014 called the germline \u2014 is, in a sense, immortal.Over time, a cell\u2019s proteins become deformed and clump together. When cells divide, they pass that damage to their descendants. Over millions of years, the germline ought to become too devastated to produce healthy new life.\u201cYou take humans \u2014 they age two, three or four decades, and then they have a baby that\u2019s brand new,\u201d said K. Adam Bohnert, a postdoctoral researcher at Calico Life Sciences in South San Francisco, Calif. \u201cThere\u2019s some interesting biology there we just don\u2019t understand.\u201dOn Thursday in the journal Nature, Dr. Bohnert and Cynthia Kenyon, vice president for aging research at Calico, reported the discovery of one way in which the germline stays young.The researchers discovered this process by studying a tiny worm called Caenorhabditis elegans. The worm has been a favorite of biologists for 50 years because its inner workings are much the same as our own.C. elegans relies on many of the same genes that we do to control the division of cells, for example, and to program faulty cells to commit suicide.That finding, which Dr. Kenyon made while a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, led to the discovery of an entire network of genes involved in repairing cells, allowing animals to live longer. Humans depend on similar genes to repair our cells, too.\u201cCynthia really pioneered the field of aging and rejuvenation using C. elegans,\u201d said Irina M. Conboy, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley.The longest-lived mutant worms savored only an extra few weeks of life, but their germlines kept rolling along from one generation to the next.Dr. Kenyon\u2019s curiosity about the germline\u2019s secrets was sharpened in 2010 by a study by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Goudeau and Hugo Aguilaniu, two biologists then at the University of Lyon in France. (Dr. Goudeau now works at Calico.) They took a close look at the proteins in the worm\u2019s egg-like cells, called oocytes.Most C. elegans are hermaphrodites, producing both eggs and sperm. As the eggs mature, they travel down a tube, at the end of which they encounter sperm.Dr. Goudeau and Dr. Aguilaniu then ran the same experiment with a twist. They mutated a gene in the worms, leaving them unable to make sperm. The eggs in these entirely \u201cfemale\u201d worms were filled with damaged proteins and did not get repaired.These experiments raised the possibility that the sperm were sending out a signal that somehow prompted the eggs to rid themselves of damaged proteins. In 2013, Dr. Kenyon and Dr. Bohnert set out to test that possibility. (They moved the research to Calico in 2015.)Clumping proteins are involved in many diseases of old age, such as Alzheimer\u2019s. Dr. Kenyon and Dr. Bohnert set up an experiment using a special strain of worms in which clumping proteins glowed.In hermaphrodite worms, they discovered, immature eggs were loaded with protein clumps, while the ones close to the sperm had none. The researchers then created mutant \u201cfemale\u201d worms and observed that their eggs all became littered with protein clumps.When Dr. Bohnert let them mate with males, however, the clumps disappeared from the eggs. \u201cIn thirty minutes you typically see them cleared out,\u201d he said.Dr. Bohnert and Dr. Kenyon then carried out additional studies, such as looking for other mutant worms that could not clear out protein clumps even though they could make sperm. Combining these findings, the researchers worked out the chain of events by which the eggs rejuvenate themselves.It begins with a chemical signal released by the sperm, which triggers drastic changes in the egg. The protein clumps within the egg \u201cstart to dance around,\u201d said Dr. Bohnert.The clumps come into contact with little bubbles called lysosomes, which extend fingerlike projections that pull the clumps inside. The sperm signal causes the lysosomes to become acidic. That change switches on the enzymes inside the lysosomes, allowing them to swiftly shred the clumps.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge, coordinated shift,\u201d said Dr. Bohnert.Dr. Bohnert and Dr. Kenyon hypothesize that the worms normally keep their eggs in a dormant state. The eggs accumulate a lot of damage, but make little effort to repair it.Only in the last minutes before fertilization do they destroy protein clumps and damaged proteins, so that their offspring won\u2019t inherit that burden. The detritus may even be recycled, Dr. Kenyon speculated, into building blocks needed to make the new proteins that are required to develop an embryo.\u201cOnce the oocyte hears the knocks on the door, then it can just clean it all out and even use it as food, maybe,\u201d she said.If her previous research is any guide, then we may very likely use the same strategy in human reproduction. \u201cThe hypothesis is that it\u2019s not just a worm thing,\u201d Dr. Kenyon said.That remains to be seen. In their new paper, Dr. Kenyon and Dr. Bohnert reported that they had tested this hypothesis on frogs, which are much more closely related to humans than is C. elegans.The scientists exposed frog eggs to a hormone that signals them to mature. The lysosomes in the frog eggs became acidic, just as happens in worms.\u201cI think it\u2019s a way to guarantee that you clean the slate for the next generation,\u201d said Dr. Bohnert.The germline may not be the only place where cells restore themselves in this way.Throughout our lives, we maintain a supply of stem cells that can rejuvenate our skin, guts and brains. It may be that stem cells also use lysosomes to eradicate damaged proteins.\u201cThat would have huge implications,\u201d Dr. Conboy said. It might be possible, for example, to treat diseases by giving aging tissues a signal to clean house.Calico, founded by Google in 2013, is searching for drugs to counter aging. But Dr. Kenyon doesn\u2019t see new medicine emerging from this research anytime soon.\u201cWe didn\u2019t patent anything from it,\u201d she said. \u201cI would think you\u2019d need to know a lot more before you know exactly what to do. This is still the very early stage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When New York City Was a (Literal) Battlefield", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "With old maps in one hand and Google Maps in the other, the author Russell Shorto roams across the city\u2019s five boroughs, searching for remnants of the American Revolution.Supported byNew York City is a battlefield. I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2014 psychological warfare, the endless grim clashing of economic forces \u2014 but I am being literal. When we ponder America\u2019s defining war, the Revolution, we think of Bunker Hill, or Saratoga, or Lexington and Concord, yet its largest battle, a vast and ferociously fought chess match in August and September of 1776, right after the formal declaration of the colonies\u2019 independence, ranged over what are now the five boroughs. As to why the place was so hotly contested, you already know the answer. Then, as now, as ever, New York City was the center of it all. Both sides believed that if the British took control of New York and the Hudson River, the American resistance would likely collapse.The battle isn\u2019t as well known today as other encounters during the Revolution, in part because the city has done an excellent job of removing most traces of it. Where Boston sets aside hallowed historic precincts and wends a handsome brick Freedom Trail through its Revolutionary sites, New York City buries its past under mountains of concrete and steel. Hills have been flattened, islands swallowed up by landfill, shorelines redrawn.But I was determined to find Revolutionary New York, and I did eventually, after a fashion. It helped that I had an organizing principle. I was researching a book, and, since my book isn\u2019t about military strategy I wasn\u2019t trying to cover all of the complex maneuverings of troops. I write narrative history, which to me means focusing on people\u2019s lives. Getting to know the places in which those lives unfolded helps me in my efforts to get into the individuals\u2019 heads and hearts.The book tells the story of the founding era by following the interwoven stories of six people from the period, from birth to death. They include a Connecticut slave, a Seneca warrior, a British aristocrat and an Albany shoemaker. But it was because of the other two \u2014 a Virginia planter and the teenage daughter of a British officer \u2014 that I found myself going from subway to bus to ferry around the five boroughs, with old maps in one hand and Google Maps in the other. These two figures of 18th-century America were caught up in the mayhem of New York. They gave my journey through the city\u2019s past what I always crave when I write, research or travel: a personal angle.The cheery mood of the troops ended abruptly. Walking a few blocks westward gave me a view of the Hudson River, where Washington was able to join the rest of the shocked town in observing two British warships race up the river with their guns blasting, sending cannonballs careering into the streets. It was a test of the American defenses; they failed.While he was trying to perform the impossible task of defending miles of shoreline, an odd diplomatic comedy ensued. The British wanted to negotiate, and officers arrived bearing letters intended for Washington. But the letters did not give the American commander his proper title. Washington knew how important protocol was, and refused to accept them.Then another letter arrived. Surprisingly, it was not addressed to Washington, but to a Miss Margaret Moncrieffe. She was the daughter of Major Thomas Moncrieffe, who had chosen to side with the British. The father was now on Staten Island, but Margaret was trapped behind enemy lines \u2014 i.e., in New York with the Americans \u2014 and Major Moncrieffe wanted Washington to deliver her over to him.I chose young Margaret Moncrieffe as one of my subjects in part because of this slender connection to Washington, in part because of the vibrancy of her personality, but most of all because as her life unfolded I saw her as embodying one aspect of the wider yearning for freedom that America\u2019s Revolution was a part of: the desire of women for some measure of independence. In the summer of 1776, Margaret was only 14, but she was about to reveal her nature by standing up to the most powerful man in America.For a moment, the reserved and deeply formal commander of American forces faced off with an impudent and headstrong teenager. Then Washington ended the standoff with a bit of levity, promising to find a way to send the girl to her father on Staten Island, and asking that once there she offer a toast to the American commanders.Since the building at the foot of Manhattan was alive with military secrets, and seeing as this girl was both observant and openly disposed toward the enemy, Washington thought it prudent to send her away until arrangements could be made to transfer her to the British. She found herself shipped to one of the many fortifications the Americans had constructed, at Kingsbridge, in the Bronx, just opposite the northern tip of Manhattan.I went there too. From the 231st Street subway it was a steady uphill hike. The fort is gone, of course. In place of farms and military outposts I found Chinese takeouts and check-cashing outlets. Then I was met by a steep set of stairs \u2014 a step-street \u2014 flanked by a Kingsbridge Heights community art project: two painted trees.Here young Margaret was meant to wait until diplomats could arrange for her to be reunited with her father. And here, improbably, she fell in love. None other than Aaron Burr, who at age 21 was already known as a ladies man, was stationed at Kingsbridge. The two young people apparently managed to find some time alone amid the soldiers and the gathering chaos, for Margaret later declared that Burr \u201csubdued my virgin heart.\u201dAs a result, suddenly, she changed her mind. She had been desperate to reach her father, but now she didn\u2019t want to leave Burr. But the two enemy commands had made their arrangements. Against her will, she was rowed out into the Hudson River and southward, toward Staten Island.I followed her, on the Staten Island Ferry. When we were somewhere in the Upper Bay \u2014 past Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, the choppy green-brown water below as somber as death \u2014 I imagined the scene of her wobbly transfer from an American to a British boat, as two armies that were about to engage in a world-historic conflict paused to do this small human thing.Those ships, 400 of them, were now fully occupying Washington\u2019s mind. Where would Howe choose to strike? With no way of knowing, Washington strung his men out in a long, skinny line across six miles of Brooklyn and Manhattan shoreline.Then Howe moved: On Aug. 22, 22,000 British soldiers crossed from Staten Island more or less where the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge stands, hit the beach at Gravesend Bay in Brooklyn and began decimating the American forces.Washington stayed on Manhattan for a time, believing Howe would launch another strike there. Then from the East River shore he saw the signal lights of his men on Brooklyn Heights indicating that the whole British force was enveloping Brooklyn. He crossed the river.But that wasn\u2019t very satisfying, so I ended up plunging into the battle. I marched down Smith Street, past hipster lounges, juice bars and bagel shops, past Carroll Street with its little front gardens, and turned left on Third Street. The neighborhood became industrial, which somehow seemed more suitable for mentally recreating a battlefield.Crossing the Gowanus Canal, which then was a creek, I reached the center of the fighting. With the American forces in disarray, Gen. William Alexander made a stand here, in front of the stone farmhouse of Nicholas Vechte, leading a Maryland regiment in a furious counterattack that bought time for much of Washington\u2019s bedraggled army to retreat to Brooklyn Heights.The Americans protected the passes between the hills, but the British found that the Jamaica Pass was unguarded and swarmed through. Washington then executed one of the most brilliant maneuvers of the war, using fog and the cover of darkness to get 9,000 soldiers safely across the East River to Manhattan. I mirrored their retreat, taking the ferry from Pier Six to Wall Street, on what turned out to be an appropriately heavy, gray morning.The escape of the American Army stunned the British, and Howe, the victor in the battle, took his time regrouping and planning how he would conquer the city and finish off Washington\u2019s army.From here, on Sept. 15, Washington heard cannon fire that told him his guesses at where Howe would attack were wrong. The explosions were coming from the south, as 9,000 men landed at Kips Bay, near where the United Nations now sits. The redcoats stormed across Manhattan. Washington fought a brilliant battle at Harlem Heights, but Howe took New York City. Washington\u2019s army retreated up the Hudson River, and eventually into New Jersey.Once the British had control of New York, the little city of 4,000 or so houses became, in effect, two cities: a place of stench and squalor, which had already endured much, and a genteel quarter that the British officers reserved for themselves and their families. Thus Margaret Moncrieffe made a triumphant return, and lived for a time in the center of Loyalist America. She attended the theater and danced at balls with officers, feeling for a short while that she had bested the great but stern American general with whom she had clashed.Washington was shaken to his core by the loss of New York, writing to his cousin, \u201cIf I were to wish the bitterest curse to an enemy on this side of the grave, I should put him in my stead with my feelings.\u201dBut war, like life, involves many twists. Despite what both sides thought, the loss of New York would not mean the end of American resolve. Washington\u2019s side would win, and he would achieve all the honor he craved and more. Young Margaret Moncrieffe would turn out to back the losing army, and the rest of her tumultuous and ultimately tragic life, in which she would continue to defy powerful men, would unfold in Europe.I ended my search for these two personalities of 18th-century America back at 1 Broadway, in the lobby of the building, pondering the unlikely moment they came dramatically into contact with one another. And pondering, too, the many ways that New York has been, and still is, the heart of America.Russell Shorto\u2019s most recent book is \u201cRevolution Song: A Story of American Freedom.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bobby Van\u2019s is a watering hole for investment bankers and stock traders.Nonetheless, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 lit up as soon as Mr. Reich walked in the door. \u201cI love your posts on Facebook,\u201d said the host, a barrel-chested man wearing a power suit and pink tie. \u201cI watch you on MSNBC all the time. Keep up the good work, Dr. Reich.\u201dTwo decades removed from his position in the Clinton cabinet, Mr. Reich, 71, is a multi-platform attack dog of the far left, a verbose gadfly who can be counted on to deliver withering critiques of Republicans, Democrats, lobbyists, lawyers and even former colleagues.His newfound social media acumen seems only to have made him more quarrelsome. He has more than a half million followers on Twitter, where he posts a daily fusillade of indignant tweets aimed at President Trump.But where the French economist Thomas Piketty brings an academic distance to his writing on inequality and Senator Bernie Sanders channels a righteous indignation in the political realm, Mr. Reich comes across as exactly what he is \u2014 a frumpy, sometimes pedantic professor from the University of California at Berkeley, eager to lecture anyone who will listen about our broken financial world.\u201cThe central thesis of the book and the movie is that the game really is rigged,\u201d he said over a small garden salad, which he ordered as an entree.That thesis, presented with a look of grave concern, makes for an easy sound bite, but it can be hard to prove. Yet Mr. Reich gives it a try in \u201cSaving Capitalism,\u201d which was directed by Jacob Kornbluth, who also directed Mr. Reich\u2019s previous film, \u201cInequality for All.\u201d\u201dSaving Capitalism\u201d follows Mr. Reich on a journey around the country as he talks to rural voters, politicians and small business owners. Along the way, using historical footage and animations, he explains what he says has been the systematic takeover of the legislative process by corporations and the wealthy.Though the Powell Memo surely wasn\u2019t the only reason, lobbyists began flooding Washington, and over the last 50 years, he said, many laws have been enacted that favor corporations and the wealthy.For Mr. Reich, these episodes and countless others he can cite are proof that lawmakers are more often than not looking out for the interests of corporations, not voters. \u201cWith great wealth has also come great political power,\u201d he said. \u201cWealth buys everything from tax breaks, to bailouts, to subsidies, to laws that on their face look to be neutral, but actually help particular companies or industries or wealthy people.\u201dThis is a sorry state of affairs, he suggests, and one that wasn\u2019t inevitable. Democratic presidents could have embraced labor law reform and made it easier to form unions, he said. Politicians, workers and investors could have pushed back against the corporate raiders in the 1980s, who glorified short-term profits and made enormous personal fortunes. And the government could have resisted the push to deregulate Wall Street.Putting the genie back in the bottle won\u2019t be easy, though. As convincing as he is in making his case against the flaws in our current version of capitalism, Mr. Reich is less so when it comes to prescribing a remedy. He comes prepared with a laundry list of progressive pipe dreams. Get big money out of elections. Stop the revolving door between government and industry groups. End gerrymandering of voting districts. Raise the minimum wage.Yet for any of these to happen, Democrats would have to start winning more elections. And at the end of the Netflix film, he implores viewers to organize and vote. He knows it won\u2019t be easy, but he says the alternative is bleak. \u201cIf we\u2019re not vigilant, we will lose our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public is waking up to that fact.\u201dIf it all sounds familiar, it is because Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders and even Donald J. Trump have appealed to disaffected workers in recent presidential campaigns.\u201cThe country is catching up with him,\u201d Darrell West, vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said of Mr. Reich. \u201cFor a long time he was preaching in the wilderness. Now there\u2019s a closer fit between his critique and how ordinary people view the world.\u201d\u201cWe are on the way to becoming a two-tiered society, composed of a few winners, and a larger group of Americans left behind, whose anger and whose disillusionment is easily manipulated,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce unbottled, mass resentment can poison the very fabric of society, the moral integrity of a society, replacing ambition with envy, replacing tolerance with hate.\u201dCaptured in \u201cSaving Capitalism,\u201d Mr. Reich\u2019s remarks, made 23 years ago, could have just as easily been spoken today.Advertisement"}

The GoodLight website accounts for 15 percent of its sales, which could reach $1.5 million this year; the e-commerce behemoth Amazon makes up another 10 percent. And many of the company\u2019s business documents are stored in cloud-based data centers.But the costs of doing business on the internet may be about to rise.Without those regulations, GoodLight and other smaller businesses fear they may not have a level digital playing field to compete against deep-pocketed industry giants that could pay to get an edge online.\u201cFor such an analog product, we\u2019re heavily reliant on the digital world and the internet for our day-to-day operations,\u201d said Mr. Callicott, who helped found the company nearly eight years ago and now works with three other full-time employees. \u201cThe internet, the speed of it, our entire business revolves around that.\u201dInternet service providers say that the proposal would lead to a better variety of services for online customers and more innovation in the industry.For small businesses, a rollback could fundamentally change how, and whether, they do business. Many started online or turned to e-commerce to expand their thin margins.\u201cThings are already difficult enough as it is for a small businesses,\u201d Mr. Callicott said. \u201cYou\u2019re busy enough just keeping your company running, trying to grow and succeed or just stay alive, that you don\u2019t have the resources or the time to contemplate how to prepare for something like this.\u201d\u201cThe open internet has made it possible for us to rely on a free market where each of us has the chance to bring our best business ideas to the world without interference or seeking permission from any gatekeeper first,\u201d the groups wrote.Many entrepreneurs worried that, without net neutrality provisions, internet providers would wield their increased power to control how businesses reach consumers.Critics of the F.C.C. proposal say internet service providers could manipulate traffic speeds to establish a \u201cfast lane\u201d of sorts or cap or block access to certain sites, charging fees to lift the restrictions. Small enterprises would struggle to pay, leaving them at a commercial disadvantage, they said.Independent contractors like Clayton Cowles, who works in upstate New York, could also be vulnerable.Mr. Cowles draws the text for comic book publishers including Marvel, DC and Image, and has worked on Batman, Star Wars and other popular series.Each month, he pays Spectrum, his internet service provider, $90.70 for the company\u2019s most powerful service package, which is supposed to allow him to send enormous digital documents within seconds. Instead, his files sometimes take 15 minutes to be delivered, he said.A more deeply deregulated Spectrum is one of his \u201cgreatest fears,\u201d he said.\u201cThey pretty much have a monopoly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m stuck with them.\u201dA pay-for-play internet system could also be problematic for Codecademy, an education company founded in 2011. Its services include courses on tech-related subjects like data analysis, website design and coding language \u2014 all conducted online.But Zach Sims, the company\u2019s chief executive, said that students, many of whom are aspiring entrepreneurs, would suffer most.\u201cThey\u2019ll perceive it as an unfair playing field,\u201d he said. \u201cAs every industry is upended by tech, the barrier to entry is knowing what technology is and how to implement it, but this adds another level of confusion, making the hurdle even higher for normal businesses to participate.\u201dFollow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsuNiraj Chokshi contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andy Rubin, Android Creator, Steps Away From Firm Amid Misconduct Report", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA former Google executive who is widely credited with creating Android smartphone software has taken a leave of absence from the start-up he now runs, the company said on Wednesday \u2014 a day after a report that he was involved in an inappropriate relationship with a female subordinate while he was at Google.The executive, Andy Rubin, was the subject of an internal Google investigation in 2014 after the female employee complained about the relationship, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were confidential. The inquiry found that the relationship was inappropriate because the woman worked on the Android team while Mr. Rubin was leading it, this person said.Mr. Rubin, who runs the smartphone hardware start-up Essential, asked to take a leave of absence this month to address personal matters, Shari Doherty, an Essential spokeswoman said. Essential did not specify when exactly the leave started or when employees had been told of Mr. Rubin\u2019s absence.A spokesman for Mr. Rubin disputed the idea that Mr. Rubin had been involved in inappropriate behavior during his time at Google.\u201cAny relationship that Mr. Rubin had while at Google was consensual and did not involve any person who reported to him,\u201d Michael Sitrick, the spokesman, said. \u201cMr. Rubin was never told by Google that he engaged in any misconduct while at Google and he did not, either while Google or since.\u201dGoogle declined to comment on Wednesday on the circumstances surrounding Mr. Rubin\u2019s departure. The company\u2019s policies do not prohibit co-workers from having romantic relationships, but its code of conduct states that such relationships can create actual or apparent conflicts of interest. If that happens, the code of conduct says, \u201cIt may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved.\u201dMr. Rubin helped popularize the use of keyboards on phones by introducing the Sidekick device in 2002. He went on to develop Android, which was acquired by Google in 2005. Android software now runs on about 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones.Mr. Rubin\u2019s departure from Google surprised many industry watchers because he had started to build a robotics unit at the company, going on a buying spree that led to the acquisition of at least eight robotics companies in what appeared to be part of a long-term project to commercialize robotics technology. Google transferred oversight of the Android group to Sundar Pichai, who is now Google\u2019s chief executive, in 2013.After leaving Google, Mr. Rubin started Playground, which is part venture capital firm and part technology-hardware incubator. Google is among its investors.Mr. Rubin founded Essential and released the company\u2019s first product, a premium smartphone running Android software, this year. He positioned the phone as having high-end features and materials like Apple\u2019s iPhone but without closed proprietary software like Apple\u2019s iOS operating system. Even before shipping a single product, Essential was valued at more than $1 billion.Advertisement"}

I did \u2014 Googled my way right to it in seconds.\u201cThe Murtadd Brotherhood has emerged as a poisoned spearhead carried by the Crusaders in their war against the Khilafah,\u201d he said in a nearly 5,000-word paean to holy war.What really caught my eye, though, was an article with the headline \u201cJust Terror Tactics.\u201d Beneath a photograph of a Hertz rental truck, the piece read, \u201cThough being an essential part of modern life, very few actually comprehend the deadly and destructive capability of the motor vehicle and its capacity of reaping large numbers of casualties if used in a premeditated manner.\u201dThe article went on to give advice on how to leave the longest \u201ctrail of carnage\u201d possible.New York showed remarkable resilience after the attack, moving unflinchingly into its huge Halloween parade hours later, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio among the costumed revelers. But forgive me if I roll back the tape to examine this latest example of how our media ecosystem can be used against us.The attack in Manhattan lent fresh urgency to questions arising from the debate over social media\u2019s downsides: Is it time to put limits on speech online, sapping the internet\u2019s anything-goes ethos? Or should we accept the occasionally lethal consequences as a cost of freedom?One thing to keep in mind on the to-be-fair side of the ledger: Law enforcement officials give the web platforms some credit for making progress against content that encourages terrorism.\u201cThey\u2019ve really made great strides in taking these things down,\u201d a New York Police Department counterterrorism official, who did not have permission to be quoted by name, told me.Nonetheless, as Google told me over the weekend in a statement, \u201cWhile we\u2019ve made good progress, we recognize there\u2019s more to do.\u201dOne such account \u2014 from a member who goes by Aswarti Media \u2014 taunts Twitter by boasting of the number of times it has regenerated after being shut down, 600 in this case. A recent iteration of the Aswarti account, which Twitter suspended in less than 24 hours, received 700,000 impressions.Hate, it turns out, travels faster than Silicon Valley justice.The terrorists behind such accounts are hard to identify because they often sign into the platforms through virtual private networks, or VPNs, that hide their identities and locations.Terrorism has been around far longer than social media and encrypted file sharing. Nonetheless, modern terrorism could not be quite what it is without it.If the problem is in full view, solutions remain elusive.While testifying at the congressional hearings last week, Mr. Smith seemed to receive a positive response from senators, including Republicans like Lindsey Graham, when he suggested the need for a new \u201clegal framework\u201d that would compel the tech companies to do more. That is especially hard in the United States, with its still-strong First Amendment.Stripping anonymity from social media users in some form appears to be where the legal discussion is going here in the United States. Mr. Smith suggested implementing legislation that would compel tech companies to restrict VPN use on their platforms only to those whose identities they know.\u201cHistorically, the right to speak anonymously is how all sorts of disenfranchised groups were able to speak freely,\u201d Ms. McSherry said. And, she noted, dissidents throughout the world often use VPNs to gain access to and convey information about government abuse. They will be less inclined to do so if they must disclose their identities, even if only to the tech companies, she said.It could be argued that search engines could block or play down results for terrorist content. But some of this material is posted in the name of academic inquiry, which \u201chas helped provide a better understanding of the broader jihadi phenomenon,\u201d said Aaron Y. Zelin, who researches jihadist movements at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.That reminds me \u2014 I\u2019ve got a magazine to get back to. Where was I? Oh, right, page 13, \u201cThe Excellence of Jihad.\u201dJaclyn Peiser contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Close-Up on Mysteries Made of Stone in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Desert", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStructures that may have been created by ancient tribes could only be studied using Google Earth. Saudi officials finally invited an archaeologist to observe them via helicopter.But he was unable to secure permission to visit the country to observe up close the ancient designs that he and amateur archaeologists had studied from their desktops.\u201cThey are absolutely astonishing,\u201d said Dr. Kennedy, who recently retired from the University of Western Australia. \u201cFrom 500 feet, you can see the vital details of structures that are invisible in the fuzzy image on Google Earth.\u201dOver the course of three days, he snapped more than 6,000 aerial photographs, lifting the veil on the ancient wonders.Since 1997, Dr. Kennedy has studied similar structures in neighboring Jordan from the ground and sky. Many of the stone figures in both countries are in basalt fields known as harrats. The fields often feature dried up lava streams that twist and turn like slithering snakes across the dark landscape.In Saudi Arabia, he explored 200 sites from the air across the regions of Harrat Khaybar and Harrat Uwayrid. The structures he observed ranged in shapes and sizes, which he describes as gates, kites, triangles, bull\u2019s eyes and keyholes.Of the 400 structures he describes as \u201cgates\u201d that he had identified on Google Earth, Dr. Kennedy studied about 40 from the helicopter and found that the structures were not randomly put together.\u201cWe could see immediately they were much more complicated than they appeared on Google Earth,\u201d Dr. Kennedy said. They were not simply heaps of stone.Rather, each long bar was actually made up of two parallel lines of flat slabs placed on their edges facing each other with small stones filling the space in between.\u201cThey are much more sophisticated than I was prepared for,\u201d he said.Some gates were larger than 1,000 feet long and 250 feet wide. He suspected the oldest may be about 9,000 years old. Though he is not sure of their purpose, he speculated they may have been used for farming purposes.Dr. Kennedy also got a closer look at about a dozen of the \u201ckites\u201d that were first discovered in the Middle East by pilots in the 1920s. These are the most famous of the Works of the Old Men, and Dr. Kennedy has identified more than 900 of them in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Harrat Khaybar.From above, they typically resemble kites with strings and tails. They are often very large, with many stretching more than a quarter-mile. Archaeologists think gazelle were corralled into the head of the kite, where the hunters would come out to kill them. Sometimes multiple kites would overlap, so that if the animals got past one funnel they would get caught in another.\u201cEssentially there was no escape,\u201d said Dr. Kennedy.The ones in Saudi Arabia looked as if they were better built than the ones in Jordan, according to Dr. Kennedy.The harrats were littered with the smaller structures he has named keyholes, wheels, triangles and bull\u2019s-eyes.Dr. Kennedy said he was surprised at how straight the lines of the triangles and keyholes were, as if the people who made them had picked out specific flat stones rather than random rocks.Each triangle was isosceles and looked like it was pointing at something. Sometimes they were directed to a bull\u2019s-eye that was about 15 feet or 150 feet away.There were also several keyhole structures, sometimes lined up together. The heads of the keyholes were almost always near-perfect circles, and the walls were about three feet high.These structures may have served some funerary or symbolic purpose. Dr. Kennedy did not date any of the structures he visited with radiocarbon testing, but he said that future groups should perform more thorough analysis.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital that somebody follows up with serious groundwork,\u201d he said.Dr. Kennedy was invited by Amr AlMadani, the chief executive officer of the Royal Commission for Al-Ula Province, which was created to safeguard some of the country\u2019s geological, historical and archaeological sites.\u201cDr. Kennedy has spent many years poring over Google Earth images, and we were able to get him much closer to the sites,\u201d said Mr. AlMadani, who joined Dr. Kennedy in the helicopter and described the experience as exciting.\u201cThinking about how life was in the Arabian Peninsula and trying to imagine the way people hunted, lived and buried the dead was very much enriching,\u201d he wrote in an email.\u201cSeeing it on Google images is one thing, but seeing it from a helicopter window from 300 feet is a totally different thing,\u201d said Don Boyer, who accompanied Dr. Kennedy.At the age of 70, Mr. Boyer is completing his doctorate in geoarchaeology and hydrology. \u201cI think I was on a high the whole time. It was just remarkable. You run out of adjectives.\u201dArchaeologists not involved in the work called it a step forward in showing the rich and complicated prehistory of the Arabian Peninsula.\u201cThe challenge now is to conduct work on the ground,\u201d he added.\u201cWhat is so critical is to do ground survey and detailed excavation work. Otherwise, archaeological sites will often time seem mysterious and enigmatic,\u201d he said in an email.\u201cNow the big and more difficult task is to document such structures on the ground to examine their function and to understand human life\u201d in the region over time, he added.___Advertisement"}

Rosqueta, founding executive director of the center. \u201cThese young adults \u2013 when you are able to intervene at this time, you can change the trajectory of their lives.\u201dAlmost all the people served by the nonprofits identified by the center are low-income. Many are already parents themselves, and a significant number have been in the foster care system their entire lives and are virtually on their own when they age out, typically at 18. Providing intensive guidance and training during this time can stop the descent into chronic homelessness and lifelong reliance on government services, Ms. Rosqueta said.Other factors make it tougher for these young people to succeed. Many have been tangled up in the criminal justice system and, with limited recourse to medical services, some struggle with mental illness, which often first makes an appearance in the late teens or early 20s.\u201cPeople need to understand something actually works with this population,\u201d Mr. Abromowitz said.Since 1999, YVLifeset has served more than 11,000 young adults in seven states, and is beginning to partner with other nonprofits and state and local governments to replicate the model. The idea, said Patrick Lawler, the chief executive of Youth Villages, is for counselors, known as specialists, to offer the resources that other parents give their children every day. They have a small caseload \u2013 only eight at a time \u2013 and meet with their clients one to two times a week.Kelly Conlin, the educational and vocational coordinator for YVLifeset in Massachusetts, said part of her role was not to tell her clients what to do but to find out what goals they have for themselves. She often meets them at a local McDonald\u2019s or Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, helping them to find the resources they need, whether it be signing up for food stamps, finding mental health care, learning a trade, finishing high school or getting into college.\u201cI get them set up for the next stage in life,\u201d she said. And just as important, or even more so, she offers them stability and support, something most have never experienced.\u201cI say, \u2018I know you can do this\u2019 \u2013 a lot of them had adults who discouraged them,\u201d Ms. Conlin said. \u201cI show them how it\u2019s attainable and help them build confidence. A lot feel their voices have never been heard.\u201dWhile such programs have been shown to do good work, \u201csocial policy change is also needed,\u201d said Mark E. Courtney, a professor at the University of Chicago in the School of Social Service Administration, who has long studied child welfare policy and services. The nonprofits, no matter how good, \u201care only able to serve a small proportion of the population who could benefit from them.\u201dBut, said Professor Courtney, who was one of the authors of the independent study, the best organizations helping young adults are committed to learning what works and what doesn\u2019t. And they have found that just as important as offering their participants real-world skills is providing a place where they are welcomed rather than spurned.\u201cThese programs do what good parents do: They have faith that we will do well in the world,\u201d he said, adding that those who participate in the programs generally say, \u201c\u2018I was welcome, they had faith in me, they\u2019re not afraid of me.\u2019 And that\u2019s really important, because the messages they get from society is the opposite.\u201dShe tried some other programs, but nothing clicked. YouthBuild, she said, \u201cmakes me feel like a new and different Taryn.\u201d It\u2019s not only the skills she\u2019s acquiring, but also that the staff members \u201cacknowledge the good stuff.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t down-talk,\u201d she said. \u201cThey pay attention and listen.\u201dShe started at YouthBuild Philadelphia two months ago and is working in the GreenBuild construction training track, learning to build solar panels and other sustainable energy products. Her goal is go on to a local community college, major in business and construction and then start her own business.The first YouthBuild program started in the 1970s as an experiment in East Harlem in New York City to get low-income youths to rebuild vacant and dilapidated homes in their own community. In 1992, Congress created the federal YouthBuild program and it is now part of the federal Department of Labor. It receives funding from AmeriCorps, as well as corporate, private and foundation grants.Now, there are 230 YouthBuild programs in the United States and 80 internationally. Programs are often housed within a larger nonprofit, such as a YMCA or housing development.Although the emphasis is on the construction trade at many YouthBuild programs, in Philadelphia, the largest YouthBuild program, students can get a certificate in one of four areas: construction building trades; customer service and business administration; child care; and health care.Nationally, 75 percent complete the program, 74 percent receive a high school diploma or certificate, and a little more than half go on to jobs or higher education.It has 22 locations across the country, some within community colleges, and about 19,000 young adults have gone through the program; the students earn 20 to 30 college credits if they finish it. Almost 30 percent are homeless or don\u2019t have stable housing, Mr. Chertavian said. And almost half have been exposed to violence or trauma. But he also has a more cheerful statistic: Ninety-one percent of his graduates get a full-time job with an average salary of $40,000.Kerry Sullivan, president of the Bank of America Charitable Foundation, who also sits on Year Up\u2019s board, said that of the 470 interns the bank has hired through the program since 2004, 170 have gone on to full-time jobs.\u201cThe journey began as a philanthropic one, but as time went on, we\u2019re now looking at it as a pipeline,\u201d she said,Although not everyone succeeds, even with the help of such programs, those who do make it through often see them as lifesavers. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gone there, I believe that I would have been part of the 97 percent who age out of foster care who don\u2019t graduate college,\u201d Jonathan, the student at Bridgewater State University, said of of Youth Villages. \u201cI would have lived paycheck to paycheck. Even more important, he said, they \u201cbelieved in me.\u201d he said. \u201cI never had anyone believe in me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Right Way to Paint Your Apartment, According to a Pro", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPainting an apartment is like going out to dinner \u2014 you can find a hot dog wagon, put down a few bucks and get it over with, or you can go to a nice restaurant and spend a bundle. It all depends on how much time, effort, and money you want to spend.For most people, though, cheaper is better, and that means doing it yourself. Assuming your walls and ceilings are in basic good shape, here\u2019s how to do it the right way, based on my ten years of professional paint contracting experience.Figuring out the type and amount of materials you\u2019ll need for the job is often the most challenging aspect of painting. If you bring your wall and ceiling measurements to the store, they\u2019ll hook you up with exactly what you need. Many will even deliver paint and supplies.You want to choose the right type of paint \u2014 that means water-based latex flat paint for ceilings, flat or \u201ceggshell\u201d finish for walls, and eggshell or semi-gloss for sills and doors. Don\u2019t be afraid to overbuy, as most stores allow returns of anything unopened, save for custom-mixed colors. Also, don\u2019t buy cheap brushes; nothing\u2019s more annoying than trying to move quickly but having to stop constantly and pick bristles out of your paint.If you have water or mildew stains on your surfaces, buy a quick-drying alkyd or oil-based stain-killing primer, which can double as a primer for patched holes and cracks (and in this case, a cheap disposable brush or disposable mini-roller and handle is fine). If you\u2019ve no stains, buy a water-based primer to seal up any repairs or patches after they dry.Here\u2019s what you should get at the paint store.\u2022 A nine-inch paint pan and one plastic tray liner for each color change\u2022 Two nine-inch, medium-nap roller covers, and one sturdy nine-inch roller handle\u2022 A two-and-a-half-inch angled paint brush\u2022 One roll of fiberglass mesh tape to cover cracks before you apply Spackle\u2022 As many plastic drop cloths as you\u2019ll need to cover your furniture\u2022 One roll each of two-inch masking tape and nonstick painter\u2019s blue tape (to mask off doorknobs, floorboards, windowsills and other unpainted surfaces. Do not use regular masking tape for this or you will spend hours trying to peel it off afterward!)\u2022 A quart of spackling compound, and two sheets of #120 sandpaper, if needed\u2022 A quart of latex primer, if priming is needed\u2022 A clamp-on electric light fixture, and extra 100-watt bulbsNext, some supplies you likely already have:\u2022 Flat-head and Phillips screwdrivers\u2022 Plenty of rags\u2022 Plastic quart containers (like the kind soup comes in from a takeout restaurant)\u2022 An extension pole to attach your roller to (your broom handle will work, just be gentle so it doesn\u2019t snap in half)\u2022 A stepladder\u2022 Gloves\u2022 Cap, old shirt, old jeans, old shoes; clothes you\u2019re willing to get dirty\u2022 A standing fanOnce you have everything you need for the job, you have to properly protect everything you don\u2019t want damaged, dripped on or sprayed (meaning your desktop computer, the desk, the flat-screen TV, the cat). Prepare the night before if possible, so you\u2019re ready to start work early in the morning.Move as much furniture as possible out of the room, or, if you live in a studio, pile everything in the center of the room, leaving at least a body-width between your stuff and the walls. Then cover your possessions with plastic drop cloths, and tape the plastic to the floor so wind from fans or windows (which you\u2019ll open before you begin for ventilation) doesn\u2019t blow it off. Sweep and mop your floors, too; dust bunnies can fly up into your freshly painted wall or into your pan. If you have it in you, wash the walls with mild detergent and let them dry overnight.Next, protect the surfaces you don\u2019t want to paint. Use blue painter\u2019s tape to mask off doorknobs, hinges and the floorboards. Cover the floors with newspaper or sheets. Remove all light switch and electrical outlet covers, and place all screws and covers in a quart container so you can quickly find them when you\u2019re done. This is a time-consuming step, but worth it for the uniform, crisp look it provides when you\u2019re done.If you have cracks, holes or wall damage, now is the time to repair them. Open any wall cracks with your putty knife, cover them with your fiberglass tape (instructions on the package of fiberglass tape will show you how to do this correctly), and fill them with Spackle. Do a few light coats of Spackle instead of one thick one. If it takes too long to dry, you can speed things up with a blow dryer. In the morning, before you start painting in earnest, sand the patches lightly and apply a coat of quick-drying latex primer over them.First, suit up. Put on your gloves and your painting clothes. Grab your rags and step ladder, and assemble all of your tools. Turn your fan on the low setting, and open the windows. You\u2019ll want to paint the ceiling first. It\u2019s the most physically challenging part of the job. Many people leave the ceiling until the end, and by that time they\u2019re tired and just want to stop.Shake your first gallon of paint and use a flat-head screwdriver to open the can. Pour your paint into your quart container until it\u2019s about three-quarters full. Resist the urge to fill it up or underfill it; it should feel balanced in your hand as you carry it around the room and up and down ladders. Dip your brush into the paint about an inch; do not saturate it.Start by using the brush to \u201ccut\u201d in where the ceiling meets the wall all around the room. Brushwork takes much longer than rolling, so don\u2019t be impatient if it seems to take a long time. When you roll, the job will go much faster. Anywhere detail is required, make sure to use a brush. Your goal is to finish the brushwork before you start rolling, so you don\u2019t have to stop.Once you finish the brushwork, it\u2019s time to prep your roller. Pour about half a gallon of paint into your lined paint tray. Place a roller on the roller handle, attach the handle to your broomstick, dip the roller into the pan and roll your roller back and forth until it\u2019s covered in equal amounts. Roll the paint onto the ceiling smoothly, in long, even strokes, from the center of the room out toward the walls.When you move to the walls with your roller, start near the ceiling and work down and diagonally, instead of \u201cstraight, straight, straight\u201d \u2014 you don\u2019t want vertical lines in your finished work. Make sure it covers well, especially if you\u2019re going white over white \u2014 it\u2019s easy to miss spots. Resist the urge to apply pressure; let the roller do the work.Finally, allow more time than you think you\u2019ll need. A lot more. You may think two days is a ridiculously long time to allocate for painting a single room, for example, but the last thing you want is to be working at 2 a.m. on Sunday night when you have to be at work at 8 on Monday morning.When you\u2019re ready to clean up, warm water is your friend. Since your paint is water-based, all your tools (and you) will clean up nicely with H20, and a little patience. Any half-used cans of paint should be shut tightly, labeled and dated. You can touch up any dinged walls within a month or two, but wait any longer and you\u2019ll see the touch-up.\u2022 Don\u2019t shop for paint before 10 a.m. or after 4 p.m. or you\u2019ll get caught waiting in line behind all the contractors.\u2022 Shop the day before you paint, especially if you\u2019re not 100 percent sure about colors, as it can take a while to select, purchase and transport materials.\u2022 Never leave a tool or paint bucket on a ladder; you can forget it\u2019s up there, and when you move the ladder, down it comes.\u2022 If you spill paint, stop right away and clean it up with a bucket of warm water and a rag. The longer you wait, the more trouble it is to get it all up. Prevent those spills in the first place by resisting the urge to daydream \u2014 keep your mind on your work.\u2022 If you take a break for more than a few minutes, wrap your brushes in aluminum foil and cover the paint pan with plastic. Otherwise it will start to dry and leave little bits of dried paint in your pan.\u2022 If you have a curious dog or cat, put them in the bathroom and close the door while you work.\u2022 Don\u2019t vacuum Spackle dust. It\u2019s finer than household dust, will seep through the vacuum\u2019s filter, and will instantly end your machine\u2019s life. Use a sponge and soapy water to clean up. You may have to mop more than once.\u2022 Don\u2019t just throw your paint cans away. Google \u201cHow to dispose of empty paint cans\u201d in your neighborhood. Many communities regulate the proper disposal of paint and painting supplies.\u2022Put your phone away and keep it hidden, unless you want paint on it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Pass-Throughs vs. Corporations \u2014 Who\u2019s the Bigger Winner?", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here are some of the stories we are watching. \u2022 One of the biggest German IPOs in years could arrive next year.Pass-throughs have a lower total tax burden than corporations do. That advantage exists now and remains in both the House and Senate versions of the tax bill.The key point here is that corporations and their investors are taxed twice:First, a corporate rate on profits is paid directly by the company. Under current law, the top rate is 35 percent. Then, when the business pays returns to its investors, they pay tax on the money they\u2019ve earned when they file in April. That income \u2014 dividends and capital gains \u2014 is taxed at a top rate of 23.8 percent.Pass-through businesses, meanwhile, are taxed just once:These are small and mammoth partnerships, proprietorships and companies with fewer than 100 shareholders known as S corporations... They aren\u2019t subjected to any separate business tax, but pay on their individual income tax when the money thrown off by the business is passed through to its owners. The rate depends on what bracket someone is in, but the highest is 39.6 percent.So while the corporate rate by itself may be lower than the top pass-through rate, the total tax burden on corporations is higher.But even in Republican rewrite of the tax code \u2014 in which the corporate rate is lowered to 20 percent \u2014 pass-throughs still come out on top. That again is because corporation are taxed twice.Six months ago, Don Blankenship \u2014 the former C.E.O. of Massey Energy and once one of the most-feared men in the coal industry \u2014 shed his label as federal inmate 12393-088.Now Mr. Blankenship, who was convicted of crimes related to the explosion at the Massey-run Upper Big Branch mine in 2010 that killed 29 men, is pursuing a new career: senator.One thing Mr. Blankenship won\u2019t have a problem with is name recognition: He\u2019s one of the best-known figures in West Virginia, both for his decade-long tenure as the C.E.O. of Massey and then for his downfall after the mine explosion.Mr. Blankenship\u2019s quasi-dictatorial management style as chief executive produced spectacular results for Massey, transforming it from a relatively modest business dominated by a single family into a corporation that operated more than 150 mines and brought in more than $2.6 billion in revenue.Mr. Blankenship was eventually convicted of having deliberately skirted federal mining safety requirements. It\u2019s a charge he has consistently denied, and he has called himself an \u201cAmerican political prisoner.\u201dThere has certainly been a lot of talk about media mergers in recent weeks.But all this news may have obscured the fact that media deal making has slowed markedly this year. So far in 2017, the value of announced media deals in 2017 is down 69 percent in the United States from a year ago and 57 percent globally, according to Thomson Reuters.The total volume of these deals is at its lowest level since 2013 in the United States and 2012 worldwide.Few, for example, believe that Comcast \u2014 which is in discussions to buy significant portions of 21st Century Fox \u2014 would be allowed to complete that potential deal unless the Justice Department was defeated in its AT&T lawsuit.So until there is a conclusion to the AT&T-Time Warner deal, big media acquisitions are likely on hold.Their shared goals: Expand Kind from being a snack maker into a health-food empire, and expand its international sales.\u201cJob No. 1 is taking it global. Job No. 2 is, what other categories either are we already in, or we can easily get into, that meet the Kind promise?\u201d Grant F. Reid, the Mars chief executive, told Andrew in an interview.____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London.____________________________The Healthineers unit is among Siemens\u2019 most profitable businesses, generating 13.8 billion euros, or about $16 billion, in revenue in the company\u2019s 2017 fiscal year, which ended in September. The Healthineers business supplies technology to the health care industry, including diagnostic imaging and laboratory diagnostics.Siemans did not disclose the size of the listing or the potential price range but is expected to sell a minority stake of up to 25 percent in the business. Some analysts have estimated that the listing could value the unit at up to \u20ac40 billion.Siemens first announced plans to list a minority stake in the business last year.Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are acting as global coordinators on the listing.The British cinema owner Cineworld confirmed on Wednesday that it was in advanced discussions to potentially acquire Regal Entertainment Group for about $3.1 billion.If the deal were to be completed, the two largest movie theater chains in the United States would be owned by overseas companies. AMC Entertainment is owned by the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda.The confirmation came after Regal said on Tuesday night that it was in discussions with Cineworld about an all-cash transaction to acquire Regal for $23 a share. Shares of Regal are up nearly 5 percent to $20.59 in recent trading.\u201cSo-called premium video-on-demand could see movies appear on streaming services just weeks after their theatre debuts. That would cut Ebitda by 8 percent, according to Credit Suisse, and make a Hollywood-style happy finale even less likely.\u201dAnother key part of AT&T\u2019s filingTo show that it would not abuse any increase in power that buying Time Warner would afford, AT&T said that it had offered rival distributors the same sort of deal that the government allowed in the last big vertical media merger, Comcast\u2019s purchase of NBCUniversal.That includes:\u2022 Letting rival video providers make use of arbitration in any dispute involving Turner\u2019s channels.The AT&T flyaroundA tax overhaul proposal emerged from the Senate Budget Committee after two notable Republican dissidents, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Bob Corker of Tennessee, said their concerns were resolved.The Washington flyaround\u201cThey have promised to cover it all, we don\u2019t care what they say their estimate is,\u201d said one senior E.U. diplomat. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to help them present it.\u201dReports of progress pushed up the value of the British pound this morning to about $1.34.The opposition to the F.C.C.\u2019s plans to repeal the Obama-era regulations has included more than 200,000 phone calls placed to Congress and about 500,000 comments on the F.C.C.\u2019s website.Critics\u2019 corner, F.C.C. editionBut TCI is also getting something that it had wanted, sort of: Donald Brydon, the L.S.E. chairman whom the fund wanted replaced, said that he would step down in 2019.But it\u2019s bound to get messier. While a federal judge has denied an emergency request by the agency\u2019s deputy director, Leandra English, to stop Mick Mulvaney from taking over as acting director, her lawsuit is likely to proceed.How else to describe the decision by the judge overseeing the company\u2019s court battle with Alphabet\u2019s self-driving car unit to delay the trial? He did so after discovering that Uber had not produced a letter that he said was potentially relevant evidence.\u201cI can no longer trust the words of the lawyers for Uber in this case,\u201d Judge Alsup said. \u201cIf even half of what is in that letter is true, it would be an injustice for Waymo to go to trial.\u201dAn Uber spokeswoman said that nothing in the letter affected the merits of the lawsuit.The Uber flyaroundAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time to Tax Companies for Using Our Personal Data", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur data is valuable. Each year, it generates hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of economic activity, mostly between and within corporations \u2014 all on the back of information about each of us.It\u2019s this transaction \u2014 between you, the user, giving up details of yourself to a company in exchange for a product like a photo app or email, or a whole ecosystem like Facebook \u2014 that\u2019s worth by some estimates $1,000 per person per year, a number that is quickly rising.The value of our personal data is primarily locked up in the revenues of large corporations. Some, like data brokerages, exist solely to buy and sell sets of that data.Why should companies be the major, and often the only, beneficiaries of this largess? They shouldn\u2019t. Those financial benefits need to be shared, and the best way to do it is to impose a small tax on this revenue and use the proceeds to build a better, more equitable internet and society that benefit us all.The data tax could be a minor cost, less than 1 percent of the revenue companies earn from selling our personal data, spread out over an entire industry. Individually, no company\u2019s bottom line would substantially suffer; collectively, the tax would pull money back to the public, from an industry profiting from material and labor that is, at its very core, our own.This idea is not new. It is, essentially, a sales tax, among the oldest taxes that exist, but it hasn\u2019t been done because assigning a fixed monetary value to our data can be very difficult. For a lot of internet businesses, our personal data either primarily flows through the business or remains locked within.The flow-through type of business is an internet provider, like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon; the latter is a platform provider, like Facebook or Twitter. Google mostly makes platforms, like its search function and Gmail, but it also lays fiber-optic cable, providing the internet to some municipalities. The company also is making self-driving cars.It\u2019s perhaps easiest to consider your data as something real and physical, like a car, which, in a sense, it is. It moves around a real, physical infrastructure, owned and operated by the internet providers, and the information is also stored \u2014 or parked \u2014 on millions of hard drives in vast buildings in usually cold climes. These are owned and operated by the platform makers, including Amazon, which has a very lucrative arm that does nothing but rent out its server space.When you use the internet, your information travels through the providers\u2019 pipes (roads) and into and out of the platform makers\u2019 servers (parking lots). For the most part, the platform makers rely on your data to improve their products. Google uses its immense trove of real human searches to make better artificial intelligence like transcriptions, translations and self-driving cars.How much, exactly, these new and innovative businesses are worth is unclear even to Google. But it, and all the platform makers, don\u2019t just improve products with our data. The companies invite advertisers into the platforms, offering to deliver advertisements to exactly the right kind of person, at exactly the right time, based off the platform makers\u2019 intimate knowledge of us, via our data. The internet providers are less nuanced: We pay a monthly fee for access to the pipes the companies lay and the upkeep on them, but the companies also sell our data to brokers, who bundle and sell it to advertisers.It\u2019s this data brokerage industry that should be the primary, initial focus of the data tax. This industry exists solely to collect our information and sell it as a commodity to retailers, advertisers, marketers, even other data brokerages and government agencies.It\u2019s this marketplace that traffics in the actual monetary value of our data, and from it we can begin to map just how much that data might be worth overall.Microlevies like this one have been issued successfully before. Over the last decade, the governments of 10 countries, including Chile, France and Niger, have successfully raised more than 1 billion euros in funding from a tax on airline tickets of \u20ac1 to \u20ac40 depending on the class of ticket.The money generated has gone toward global H.I.V./AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria eradication programs. In Austria, the government was considering imposing a value-added tax on the big data transactions of social media companies that benefit from personal data, but has been stymied by the complications of assigning a fixed value to such transactions.Our data is ours, but it also is not ours. We trade it away for so much of our experience on the internet. Money from a data tax could begin to counter this trade imbalance.The money should go toward improving privacy of our information on the internet, countering identity theft, improving connectivity and internet literacy, all causes that would help create a more equitable internet for all.Saadia Madsbjerg is managing director of the Rockefeller FoundationAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy, Bracing for Electoral Season of Fake News, Demands Facebook\u2019s Help", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 With critical national elections only months away, anxiety is building that Italy will be the next target of a destabilizing campaign of fake news and propaganda, prompting the leader of the country\u2019s governing party to call on Facebook and other social media companies to police their platforms.\u201cWe ask the social networks, and especially Facebook, to help us have a clean electoral campaign,\u201d Matteo Renzi, the leader of the Democratic Party, said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cThe quality of the democracy in Italy today depends on a response to these issues.\u201dNo one in Italy is more worried than the governing Democratic Party. In recent days, its members have made an orchestrated attempt to focus the attention of the country \u2014 and of powerful social media platforms like Facebook \u2014 on a misinformation campaign that they believe is devised to damage one of the last major center-left governments standing in Europe.Mr. Renzi, a wily political operator who partly blames online misinformation campaigns and fake news for the failure of a referendum that forced his resignation in December, is not only seeking to protect himself, but also to go on the offensive.Mr. Renzi is making the issue central to his own Facebook posts and a conference he will kick off in Florence on Friday evening to call attention to the issue.Davide Colono, a member of the family that managed the sites, said the content was merely intended to attract clicks in a country fed up with the Democratic Party\u2019s government. He called the shuttering of the sites \u201cagainst the freedom of the press\u201d and \u201cjust politics.\u201dFacebook representatives have told Italian officials that they are planning to dispatch an Italian \u201ctask force\u201d of fact-checkers to address the fake-news problem here before the elections, according to a government official who was present during the negotiations but was not authorized to speak on the record.Facebook declined to comment on Friday about those plans.Mr. Stroppa has also prepared a report for Mr. Renzi that attempts to demonstrate a connection between seemingly unrelated sites promoting rival anti-establishment political movements critical of Mr. Renzi and the center-left government.The report, which Mr. Stroppa shared with The New York Times, shows that the official web page of a movement promoting Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League party, shares unique Google codes with a fan and propaganda page supportive of the Five Star Movement.The codes, used to track advertising and web traffic, are also shared by an array of other sites, some of which spread wild conspiracy theories, attack Mr. Renzi or deliver explicitly pro-Russian spin.The assorted sites share a unique ID assigned by Google Analytics to keep track of how a site is performing, as well as an AdSense number through which Google manages advertisements placed on the sites, according to data in Mr. Stroppa\u2019s report and verified by The Times.All the sites also share a template on their contact pages. But in the murky world of internet propaganda and subterfuge, the tilt of the content is clearer than where it originates, and what the shared codes amount to is not entirely clear.\u201cWe frequently see unrelated sites using the same IDs, so that\u2019s not a reliable indicator that two sites are connected,\u201d said a Google spokeswoman, Simona Panseri.Some analysts, however, noted that the ad revenues would flow to the same operator and suggested that the assigning of separate site ID numbers indicated the hand of a single manager, who could then easily track traffic and metrics.Google would not identify the site administrators. Emails sent to addresses listed on the contact pages of the sites went unanswered.Chris Norton, a spokesman for Facebook, said, \u201cWe take the issue of fake news incredibly seriously.\u201d And he added that the company considered the issue of accurate information on the platform \u201cespecially important during elections.\u201dHe said it was disrupting the economic incentives for false news, removing fake accounts and investing in resources and technology to address the problem. But Facebook declined to identify the administrator of the accounts with the shared Google codes.A spokesman for the Five Star Movement said the fan page in question that shared the codes was not an official site and could have been made by an independent activist.Asked about the shared codes between his official web page and the page promoting the Five Star Movement, Francesco Zicchieri, a leader of the \u201cWe\u2019re With Salvini\u201d movement, appeared legitimately bewildered.\u201cI don\u2019t even know what we are talking about,\u201d he said, adding that the party\u2019s web guru, Luca Morisi \u201cdoes everything\u201d for the movement\u2019s assorted sites.Late Friday evening Mr. Morisi acknowledged that the site We\u2019re With Salvini shared the same Google codes as sites outside the League\u2019s political universe. He explained that a former supporter of the Five Star Movement had helped build the We\u2019re With Salvini site and pasted codes from his Five Star fan page, as well as I\u2019m With Putin and his conspiracy sites, onto the official page.\u201cBut we have nothing to do with the pro-Putin or pro-Five Star sites,\u201d Mr. Morisi said, explaining that he thought he had actually changed the codes in the past and promised to do so this weekend to clear up any confusion.The League and the Five Star Movement are not nominally allied, and even cast themselves as rivals. But they share an interest in advancing the pro-Russia, anti-establishment and anti-immigrant agenda that has made Five Star the most popular party in Italy.Five Star says it has sworn off any coalition alliances, but Mr. Salvini recently indicated that he would be open to forming a coalition.Mr. Salvini\u2019s party signed a cooperation agreement in March 2017 with Mr. Putin\u2019s United Russia Party, and Mr. Salvini, who uses xenophobic and anti-Muslim language, has repeatedly praised Mr. Putin as an ally against Islamic terrorism.The Five Star Movement has hosted on its associated websites anti-Renzi propaganda originating on Russian outlets such as Sputnik or RT.\u201cWe are at a crossroads,\u201d said Mr. Renzi, who, for now, stopped short of pointing a finger directly at Russia for interference in Italy\u2019s coming election, which he cast as a choice between growth and instability.The former prime minister said he had no proof of Russian involvement, and worried that raising the specter of Mr. Putin could become a reason \u201cto not do anything\u201d when Facebook now has the ability to close pages infected by apparently homegrown fake news.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to evoke the Russian danger,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen there is proof in our hands.\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Repeal: What Could Happen and How It Could Affect You", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s our guide for internet users looking for answers.The net neutrality rules were passed in 2015 during the Obama administration when Democrats controlled the F.C.C.The major broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast have argued that utility-style regulation represents unnecessary government meddling that will reduce their incentives to invest and improve service. The result, they say, will be worse service for everyone in the long run.The biggest concern is that the internet will become pay-to-play technology with two tiers: one that has speedy service and one that doesn\u2019t. The high-speed lane would be occupied by big internet and media companies, and affluent households. For everyone else there would be the slow lane.The brand-name internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, analysts say, will comfortably be able to pay the higher rent. It will not affect their business, though it may crimp their profits. Avoiding higher prices is one reason the major internet companies have been champions of net neutrality.That will no longer be true, Mr. Bell wrote, without net neutrality rules that \u201censure that anyone who puts something on the internet has a fair shot at finding a life-changing audience.\u201dThe government-backed guarantee of equal access is why public interest groups, nongovernmental organizations, charities and millions of private citizens wrote to the F.C.C. in support of the net neutrality rules.But the broadband and telecom companies \u2014 and some economists \u2014 say that the freedom to charge different prices for different products and services is vital to healthy markets. That kind of \u201cprice discrimination,\u201d they say, is the fuel of innovation and efficiency.In a public comment earlier this year to the F.C.C., AT&T called the Obama-era rules \u201can unprecedented regulatory overreach for which there is no economic or marketplace justification.\u201dThe F.C.C. rules mandated net neutrality principles under a utility-style telecommunications law, called Title 2, that dates to 1934. The carriers fear that it all but ensures price regulation.\u201cWhat they really object to is Title 2, not the net neutrality principles,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an independent analyst.Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who is credited with coining the phrase \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d said the repeal plan not only rolls back the Obama-era rules, it goes further. It specifically permits broadband carriers to block media content, Mr. Wu said, an added power which was not the case during the administration of George W. Bush.\u201cAn allowance of blocking is really pretty shocking.\u201d Mr. Wu said in an email.Yet if government is in retreat, then consumers are left to trust the behavior of the internet-access companies like Charter and AT&T. In their filings with the F.C.C., the companies have claimed that faith would be well founded. Market incentives, Charter told the F.C.C., push the companies to provide the best service to its customers, catering to consumer demand.Charter said it voluntarily adheres to net neutrality principles, and will continue to do so. \u201cWe do not block, throttle, or otherwise interfere with the online activity of our customers,\u201d the company said.But a weakness in the free-market argument, industry analysts say, is that in some regional and rural markets, households have only one internet provider available to them. That undermines the theory that competition will protect consumers.Roger L. Kay, an independent technology analyst, predicted that larger bills \u2014 not content blocking \u2014 would be the most likely result. If the big internet and media companies will have to pay their carriers more for high-speed services, the expenses will trickle down to households.Consumers, Mr. Kay said, \u201cwill end up paying higher prices for essentially the same service.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Evil Is Tech?", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot long ago, tech was the coolest industry. Everybody wanted to work at Google, Facebook and Apple. But over the past year the mood has shifted.Some now believe tech is like the tobacco industry \u2014 corporations that make billions of dollars peddling a destructive addiction. Some believe it is like the N.F.L. \u2014 something millions of people love, but which everybody knows leaves a trail of human wreckage in its wake.Surely the people in tech \u2014 who generally want to make the world a better place \u2014 don\u2019t want to go down this road. It will be interesting to see if they can take the actions necessary to prevent their companies from becoming social pariahs.There are three main critiques of big tech.The first is that it is destroying the young. Social media promises an end to loneliness but actually produces an increase in solitude and an intense awareness of social exclusion. Texting and other technologies give you more control over your social interactions but also lead to thinner interactions and less real engagement with the world.Eighth graders who spend 10 or more hours a week on social media are 56 percent more likely to say they are unhappy than those who spend less time. Eighth graders who are heavy users of social media increase their risk of depression by 27 percent. Teens who spend three or more hours a day on electronic devices are 35 percent more likely to have a risk factor for suicide, like making a plan for how to do it. Girls, especially hard hit, have experienced a 50 percent rise in depressive symptoms.Snapchat has Snapstreak, which rewards friends who snap each other every single day, thus encouraging addictive behavior. News feeds are structured as \u201cbottomless bowls\u201d so that one page view leads down to another and another and so on forever. Most social media sites create irregularly timed rewards; you have to check your device compulsively because you never know when a burst of social affirmation from a Facebook like may come.The third critique is that Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are near monopolies that use their market power to invade the private lives of their users and impose unfair conditions on content creators and smaller competitors. The political assault on this front is gaining steam. The left is attacking tech companies because they are mammoth corporations; the right is attacking them because they are culturally progressive. Tech will have few defenders on the national scene.Obviously, the smart play would be for the tech industry to get out in front and clean up its own pollution. There are activists like Tristan Harris of Time Well Spent, who is trying to move the tech world in the right directions. There are even some good engineering responses. I use an app called Moment to track and control my phone usage.The big breakthrough will come when tech executives clearly acknowledge the central truth: Their technologies are extremely useful for the tasks and pleasures that require shallower forms of consciousness, but they often crowd out and destroy the deeper forms of consciousness people need to thrive.Online is a place for human contact but not intimacy. Online is a place for information but not reflection. It gives you the first stereotypical thought about a person or a situation, but it\u2019s hard to carve out time and space for the third, 15th and 43rd thought.Online is a place for exploration but discourages cohesion. It grabs control of your attention and scatters it across a vast range of diverting things. But we are happiest when we have brought our lives to a point, when we have focused attention and will on one thing, wholeheartedly with all our might.Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote that we take a break from the distractions of the world not as a rest to give us more strength to dive back in, but as the climax of living. \u201cThe seventh day is a palace in time which we build. It is made of soul, joy and reticence,\u201d he said. By cutting off work and technology we enter a different state of consciousness, a different dimension of time and a different atmosphere, a \u201cmine where the spirit\u2019s precious metal can be found.\u201dImagine if instead of claiming to offer us the best things in life, tech merely saw itself as providing efficiency devices. Its innovations can save us time on lower-level tasks so we can get offline and there experience the best things in life.Imagine if tech pitched itself that way. That would be an amazing show of realism and, especially, humility, which these days is the ultimate and most disruptive technology.Advertisement"}

So much do China\u2019s government and companies value Facebook that the country is Facebook\u2019s biggest advertising market in Asia, even as it is the only major country in the region that blocks the social network.Each quarter, China\u2019s government, through its state media agencies, spends hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy Facebook ads, according to a person with knowledge of those deals, who was unauthorized to talk publicly about the company\u2019s revenue streams.China\u2019s propaganda efforts are in the spotlight with President Trump visiting the country and American lawmakers investigating foreign powers\u2019 use of technology to sway voters in the United States.Last week, executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter were grilled in Washington about Russia\u2019s use of American social media platforms to influence the 2016 presidential election.During Facebook\u2019s time in the congressional hot seat last week, Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, asked whether China had also run ads to affect the United States election. Facebook\u2019s general counsel replied that to his knowledge it had not.There is no indication that China meddled in the American election, but the Communist government\u2019s use of Facebook is ironic given its apparent fear of the platform. It also hasn\u2019t been reluctant to use it as a soapbox where China\u2019s relationship with the United States is concerned.While China\u2019s propaganda channels on Facebook are not nearly as subtle as Russian groups when it comes to influencing opinion, their techniques are nonetheless instructive.A similar blend of stories \u2014 pandas and idyllic Chinese landscapes next to heavy coverage of the mass shooting in Texas \u2014 has proliferated across China\u2019s official Facebook channels in the lead-up to Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Beijing, which began on Wednesday.While much of it is unlikely to sway the average American\u2019s mind, such posts reach people across the world, many of whom are newer to the internet and may have a less sophisticated understanding of media. China\u2019s state media has Facebook channels dedicated to Africa and other regions of the world, and it seems evident that it is offering itself as an alternative to the Western media for a more global audience.A video posted by Xinhua, which already has about 100,000 views, presents a series of man-on-the-street interviews with Chinese people talking about the United States. It begins on a positive note, with questions about Mr. Trump and what they like about the United States.About halfway through the video, however, the tone changes and people are asked to describe the problems they see with the United States.At that point, the interviewees get critical. \u201cU.S.A. interferes with others\u2019 lives arrogantly,\u201d one woman says. \u201cEvery person and nation has its own culture and customs, no need to interfere.\u201dAnother woman addresses America directly: \u201cDon\u2019t be so self-important and arrogant.\u201dEven children are asked about the relationship between the United States and China. \u201cSometimes they went too far in bullying others,\u201d one says of the Americans. \u201cThey don\u2019t respect China and use South Korea to spy on China,\u201d says another. \u201cThey also sent weapons to South Korea.\u201dWhen asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump, one man says: \u201cLet him learn from China.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Tax Bills Would Reward Companies That Moved Money Offshore", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past few decades, some of the largest companies in the United States made a big bet: By stashing hundreds of billions of dollars of profits offshore, they could slash their taxes and bolster their profits.It would take a generation to see if the strategy would fully pay off, because the law allowed companies only to defer the taxes on overseas earnings, not to permanently avoid them. Would they ever be able to bring the profits back to the United States without incurring huge tax bills?Some 20 years after the tax-avoiding technique became widespread, it is poised to pay off in a big way. The Republican tax bills making their way through the House and Senate would allow companies to bring nearly $3 trillion in profits home, at greatly reduced tax rates.In a tax-overhaul package that would provide the greatest benefits to wealthy individuals and corporations, the so-called repatriation provision stands out. It would give companies a permanent tax break of about half a trillion dollars, rewarding the likes of Google, Apple, Pfizer and General Electric. Corporate America claims that about $3 trillion in profits were generated in places like Bermuda, Grand Cayman and Luxembourg.The tax breaks for bringing home such offshore profits \u201cconfirm the central tenet of tax planning that a tax deferred is a tax avoided,\u201d said David Miller, a tax lawyer at Proskauer Rose. \u201cFor decades, U.S. multinationals have shifted profits abroad and deferred their taxes on them. If either of the tax bills pass, they will be rewarded for doing so.\u201dTo be sure, the legislation erects some potential guardrails against future efforts to shift profits offshore. It would establish a minimum tax abroad on certain types of income \u2014 at least 10 percent for the first several years in the Senate version \u2014 thus raising the tax bills for many companies on their foreign profits. And regulators in Europe and elsewhere abroad have accelerated their efforts to crack down on such profit shifting out of their countries.President Trump and congressional Republicans argue that it\u2019s important to get companies to bring the money home because it would be used to create jobs \u2014 although that didn\u2019t happen the last time lawmakers enacted a similar tax break. Mr. Trump predicted on Tuesday that trillions of dollars would be repatriated \u2014 money, he said, that companies currently are \u201cjust not able to bring back.\u201dUnder current law, American companies pay taxes on their worldwide profits at a rate of 35 percent, the highest statutory rate in the world. But the law has a big caveat: Companies can indefinitely defer the taxes on profits earned abroad \u2014 as long as those profits stay overseas.That gives companies a powerful incentive to push as much profit as possible into subsidiaries abroad. Microsoft, Merck, Facebook and other companies attribute large chunks of their profits to entities in low- or zero-tax offshore jurisdictions and therefore enjoy effective tax rates that are nowhere near 35 percent.But companies can defer the American taxes only as long as their profits remain offshore. If they want to repatriate the cash back to the United States, they must pay taxes at the rate of 35 percent, minus whatever they already paid abroad.A large loophole was opened in 1996 when the Clinton administration\u2019s Treasury Department introduced a rule that allowed different subsidiaries of the same company to move money back and forth without incurring American taxes.That removed one of the main deterrents to companies pushing profits into overseas tax havens \u2014 and opened the floodgates. Since then, the share of American companies\u2019 foreign profits attributed to a handful of tax havens has more than doubled. Now, nearly two-thirds of all profits that American companies claim to earn overseas are generated in tax-friendly jurisdictions including Bermuda, Ireland and the Netherlands, according to data compiled by Gabriel Zucman, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.The problem for corporate America, though, is that it can\u2019t easily use that overseas money for things like paying dividends or buying their own shares, techniques that publicly traded companies use to please their investors. Doing so would trigger hefty tax bills.After intense lobbying by big companies, Congress in 2004 passed the American Jobs Creation Act, which provided a one-time tax break for companies that wanted to repatriate their offshore profits. Companies brought home $312 billion at a rate of just 5.25 percent. Although the break was intended to spur investment and hiring, a plethora of studies showed that companies responded by spending billions buying back their shares, lifting their stock prices, and didn\u2019t expand their American work forces.Pfizer, for example, brought home $37 billion at the reduced rates \u2014 and shed 10,000 workers. Hewlett-Packard repatriated more than $14 billion, while eliminating more than 14,000 jobs.After that tax break, companies resumed pushing profits offshore \u2014 at an even brisker pace. Early in the Obama administration, Cisco Systems led a lobbying effort for yet another tax holiday, which went nowhere.Now, companies have accumulated approximately $2.8 trillion in profits offshore, beyond the reach of American tax authorities and barely touched by other countries, according to the Zion Research Group, a research boutique focused on accounting and tax issues.The proposals in the Republican tax package are different from the 2004 holiday. Under the current versions, all foreign earnings sitting offshore would be considered to be automatically repatriated, and taxes at a reduced rate would be paid over several years. The rates would vary, with earnings held in cash taxed at 10 percent in the Senate version. Other earnings would be taxed at half that rate. Companies would receive credit for some foreign taxes already paid.Zion Research estimated that under the Senate proposal, companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 would pay about $570 billion less than what they would if they brought the profits home under current law.American companies would no longer owe full taxes on overseas profits. Instead, they would pay taxes at a minimum rate of at least 10 percent on some types of foreign profits \u2014 compared with a new, lower rate on domestic earnings of 20 percent.Kristin J. Forbes, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s management school who served in the George W. Bush administration, said the repeated changes to the tax treatment of overseas earning were problematic.\u201cThey do cause companies to change behavior and then game the system the way they have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBig picture: This isn\u2019t how you\u2019d like to do tax policy.\u201dJim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The internet might be remembered as a failed thing. It breaks my heart to even think that, and I hope it isn\u2019t true, but I\u2019m beginning to wonder.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Near Future of Driving: Eyes Forward, but No Hands at 10 and 2", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsI am tapping this into my iPhone while sitting at the wheel of a 2018 Cadillac CT6 luxury sedan, rolling along a shade under 75 miles per hour on Interstate 94 about 20 miles west of Ann Arbor, Mich.I am not texting and driving, because, technically, I am not driving the car. The car is.Using a radar sensor, cameras, GPS positioning and a highly precise digital map, the CT6\u2019s Super Cruise driver-assistance system is handling all of the braking, accelerating and steering as I continue heading west to a lunch appointment in South Bend, Ind., 170 miles away.That leaves me free to sit back and type these words \u2014 and do much more that would otherwise be considered unsafe \u2014 as the mile markers zip by.Self-driving cars will soon be a reality. Waymo, the autonomous-car division of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is already testing hundreds of self-driving vehicles around the country. The ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft and big automakers including General Motors, Ford Motor and Audi are developing their own technology and test fleets.So on this brisk November day, my hands-free road trip with Super Cruise offered a glimpse into that future \u2014 a world in which the grinding daily commute will transform into quiet time, and long drives can become productive hours on the road.Super Cruise was introduced in September and is General Motors\u2019 answer to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, the best known of the semiautonomous driving systems that have arrived in the past two years. Neither Autopilot nor Super Cruise is fully autonomous \u2014 both require drivers to remain alert and prepared to take control at any time.But Super Cruise has one big advantage: Unlike Autopilot, it does not require you to keep your hands on the steering wheel. As I\u2019m typing this, a camera mounted on the steering column is monitoring my eyes and head. As long as I glance up every so often, Super Cruise knows that I\u2019m keeping an eye on the road.For more than an hour, Super Cruise pilots the car with no input from me \u2014 no steering, no braking and no acceleration. In that time, I cover 65 miles. With my hands free, I scroll through Twitter and Facebook. I log into my bank account and read the headlines from The New York Times.As long as I look up at the road about every three seconds, Super Cruise remains in command, maintaining a safe following distance and easing the Cadillac through the freeway\u2019s contours. When Super Cruise is engaged, a thin light strip on the top of the steering wheel appears green. If I look away longer than three seconds, it flashes to bring my gaze back on the highway. If I fail to do so, the light strip turns red and the driver\u2019s seat vibrates, telling me to take control.That has happened only once so far. To get Super Cruise back, I need only look forward and place my hands on the wheel. After a few seconds, the light strip turns green again, and my hands are free to go back to the iPhone.I quickly learn how to glance regularly at the road. My host in South Bend, my cousin Pat, calls me using the video chat function in Facebook Messenger. I hold the phone up over the steering wheel so that I can see Pat on the screen while keeping my gaze looking forward, ensuring Super Cruise remains in control.All the while, the CT6 stays centered in the left lane of I-94. But if I want to change lanes or to pass other cars, I take the wheel myself and steer the car over. The light strip turns blue, indicating I\u2019m temporarily overriding Super Cruise. Once the car is in the new lane, the strip goes back to green and I\u2019m hands-free again. It decelerates when approaching slower vehicles. When the road clears, it accelerates back up to the speed I\u2019ve selected: 74 m.p.h., four over the speed limit.At one point, a car merging onto the highway scoots in front of me. Super Cruise responds quickly and brakes. I sense no danger of a collision.G.M. is careful to specify that it is not promoting Super Cruise as a way to let drivers text, Google or open a newspaper on the highway. \u201cWe don\u2019t recommend it,\u201d said Lisa Sieradski, global product manager for the CT6. \u201cIt will allow you to glance down at a phone or the radio, but you have to return your eyes to the road.\u201dNonetheless, using the same video-chatting method, I watch a four-minute highlight video from a Rangers game. (They beat the Bruins, 4-2.) I also conduct a phone interview, taking notes with a pen and a pad. When my trip ended, I had covered 378 miles. My hands were on the wheel for no more than 25 of them.Ms. Sieradski said G.M. had tried to engineer Super Cruise to keep drivers safe \u2014 and limit opportunities to use the system improperly \u2014 by restricting how and where they could use it. The system will not operate at speeds above 85 mile per hour, for example.And Super Cruise can be activated only on divided, limited-access highways such as interstates \u2014 places where it need not contend with intersections, traffic lights and pedestrians. The system determines its exact location by relying on high-precision digital maps and GPS technology, while sensors track the surrounding traffic \u2014 the way sensors do for driver aides like adaptive cruise control. The system is able to determine when the car is on a service road along the highway, or even on entry and exit ramps \u2014 locations where it requires you to steer yourself.But when the Super Cruise system senses it is on an approved road, a white steering wheel icon appears on the instrument panel. Press a button, and the green bar lights up and the system takes over.For now, Super Cruise is available only on the 2018 CT6. Dealers in Michigan are offering the car with the option for about $73,000.The ability to cruise on the highway hands-free is a major step forward. For many drivers, systems that require them to keep their hands on the steering wheel seem almost self-defeating. What\u2019s the point of having the car steer itself if your hands have to stay on the wheel?While driving the CT6 over several days, I found it was actually more pleasing to leave my phone alone. One morning at rush hour, I sat quietly with my hands on my knees, sipping a latte as though I were relaxing on my couch.On the return leg of my South Bend trip, I turned on the back massager built into the CT6\u2019s driver\u2019s seat. From my phone, I piped a new-age meditation through the CT6\u2019s sound system.As I stared at the truck ahead of me, and the seat kneaded my lower back, I crossed the border into the state of Zen. The voice on the meditation intoned: \u201cYou are feeling relaxed and calm.\u201dFor two hours and 120 miles, I was.Advertisement"}

One of the marchers, Rishi Raj Vyas, 16, filled in the blanks.\u201cWe are here to break stereotypes,\u201d he said, \u201cto tell Delhi that we are here and we are queer.\u201dHe was one of several thousand participants in Delhi\u2019s annual gay pride parade who gathered on a smoggy afternoon this month to march, cheer and dance Bhangra through the streets of the city.Anand Grover, a lawyer leading the effort to overturn Section 377, said the privacy ruling was keeping him busy.\u201cThis is another nail in the coffin, the privacy judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to win. I don\u2019t lose my optimism.\u201dDepictions of gender-fluid identity are common in ancient texts found in Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. In Hinduism, gods transform into goddesses, or they cross-dress. Men become pregnant.Today, many Indians object to homosexuality not so much on moral grounds, but because of the pressure to marry someone of the opposite sex. Marriage is often framed as a social pact between two families in India.\u201cUnlike in the West, where religion is organized, and even homophobia seems institutionalized, in India, all of this is very fluid,\u201d Mr. Pattanaik said. \u201cThe only major issue is marriage. People want men and women to marry, no matter what their sexual orientation.\u201dIntroduced in 1861, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code imposes a 10-year prison sentence on \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature with man, woman or animal.\u201d The law most often applies to sex between men, but extends to heterosexuals engaging in \u201cpenile, nonvaginal sexual acts,\u201d said Mr. Grover, the lawyer.According to the privacy judgment, about 200 people have been prosecuted under Section 377.\u201cOur biggest problem is communities and families who say, \u2018Look, if you\u2019re telling me that this is such a normal, natural thing, why is it a criminal act?\u2019 \u201d she said from her office at the Naz Foundation.With August\u2019s privacy ruling, Ms. Gopalan said that she is again hopeful. A type of appeal known as a curative petition has already been filed against Section 377, and a verdict could be delivered as early as next year.\u201cWomen\u2019s sexuality is not talked about, not discussed, nothing, ever,\u201d Ms. Gopalan said.But Rovin Sharma, 23, a self-described drag queen, said that gender issues are still rudimentarily understood in India. Mx. Sharma, who prefers the gender-neutral Mx. in place of Mr. or Ms., told of being forced to resign from a job recently after attempting to use the women\u2019s restroom there.\u201cThere\u2019s no space for me,\u201d Mx. Sharma said.Those issues momentarily took a back seat at the parade, the 10th to be held in Delhi, as sections of the crowd unfurled a large rainbow flag. This year, fewer participants wore face masks to hide their identities at the parade, which included a smattering of Westerners.Adam Willems, 22, who was born in New York City but calls India home, said Delhi\u2019s parade was refreshingly anticapitalist, if still \u201cvery Anglophone,\u201d by which he meant it was largely attended by English-speaking, educated Indians. Mr. Willems noted that Delhi\u2019s pride organizers have resisted integrating corporate sponsors.\u201cYou don\u2019t see \u2018Tata likes the gays,\u2019 \u201d he said, referring to one of India\u2019s largest business conglomerates. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Google. You don\u2019t see Facebook. That\u2019s on purpose.\u201dIt was getting late as the parade fanned around the final focal point, a stage where volunteers from the crowd ascended the platform to read poems they had written about coming out crushes and hopes for the future.In the crowd was Ashish Chopra, 22, who had traveled from the city of Pune, more than 700 miles away, to attend the parade. Wearing rainbow suspenders and holding the hand of his mother, Simmi Nanda, 50, Mr. Chopra said he was surprised by how few parents had shown up. He began to cry, casting a long look at his mother.\u201cI really wanted my mom to come for this,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, there was a lot of drama. She was not ready to come, but even after all that, she managed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a new thing for us,\u201d Ms. Nanda said. \u201cBut still, I am trying.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Social Media and Democracy", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Social media may not create our bad habits, but it feeds them, and for one reason alone: money.Those who want to blame social media for the state of our democracy, as well as those who want to absolve the industry of blame, can\u2019t ignore this essential point.Twitter, Google and Facebook are moneymaking enterprises, and they will do whatever they need to do to increase revenue. Helping or hurting democracy is incidental to that goal, as are improving or degrading our daily lives, or making the world a better or worse place.Social media may be only as harmful as we allow it to be, but as to whether social media is a force for good, as is so often claimed, I would ask this: How many people working in the industry would still be there if their jobs paid the same as, say, teaching or social work?Don\u2019t ask about the intentions, aspirations or responsibilities of social media companies. Just follow the money. That\u2019s the real story.To the Editor:Emily Parker repeats industry ideas about individual responsibility and a faith in self-regulating systems. Manipulation, however, is a feature, not a bug, in many of the products and platforms that companies like Google and Facebook design. It is in fact the premise of the advertising businesses that account for some 90 percent of their revenue.Discreet changes to the underlying algorithms of these platforms have immense power over what is seen by users but, more important, they affect what goes unseen.But Silicon Valley corporations are willfully opaque in explaining how and where their algorithms work, what their objectives are and whom they are ultimately benefiting.To call these platforms \u201ca mirror\u201d fails to acknowledge the role that ideology plays in their construction and the power Big Tech has to determine the winners and losers in our society.JASON FRIEDMAN, BROOKLYNTo the Editor:I found the suggested \u201cfixes\u201d to Facebook et al. unhelpful, focused on technical tweaks or appeals to somehow make us nicer or more knowledgeable.Facebook, Twitter and so forth are publishers of readers\u2019 posts. The closest comparison to them is perhaps the letters column of The New York Times. You \u201ccurate\u201d your letters page very carefully; so should they.It is no excuse to protest that they simply have too much \u201cink\u201d to ever be able to do this. If you provide a huge platform, you should have a huge number of people looking after it. Like any publisher, they should be legally responsible for what they publish.ANTHONY J. WALTERS, CHICAGOTo the Editor:Getting the toothpaste back into the tube will not be easy. It\u2019s been clear for some time now that social media is an instrument of chaos. It is the equivalent of millions of people standing on soapboxes on the street and shouting things at you. Many of the things are false, some are abusive and a lot of people hide behind curtains so you can\u2019t know their true identities.As more and more Americans believe what they see on social media, they will not agree on what is real and what is fake.Democracy requires an informed and involved citizenry, and if the people in the country cannot even agree on what is actually happening, then how can our democracy survive?It may be too late, but at the very least Facebook and the others must limit their news feeds to only what comes from legitimate, acknowledged professional journalism sources.There will still be a lot of \u201calternate facts,\u201d conspiracy theories and plain lies bandied about by both innocent and willful postings, and the sites certainly should provide fact-checks about any of these that gain currency. But to wean people, especially young people, away from social media and back to legitimate news sources may be an impossible task.MICHAEL SPIELMAN, BRONXTo the Editor:While reports of entities associated with the Russian government posting propagandistic material on social media outlets are undoubtedly true, those reports are neither surprising nor significant. It is no secret that outlets such as Facebook and Twitter are online gossip boards rather than journalistic or scholarly venues.What is surprising is that people would base important decisions on social media postings since verification of their accuracy is virtually impossible. Doing so is intellectually lazy at best.PAUL ROMERO, OAKLAND, CALIF.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Building A.I. That Can Build A.I.", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "Google and others, fighting for a small pool of researchers, are looking for automated ways to deal with a shortage of artificial intelligence experts.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 They are a dream of researchers but perhaps a nightmare for highly skilled computer programmers: artificially intelligent machines that can build other artificially intelligent machines.With it, Google may soon find a way to create A.I. technology that can partly take the humans out of building the A.I. systems that many believe are the future of the technology industry.The project is part of a much larger effort to bring the latest and greatest A.I. techniques to a wider collection of companies and software developers.The world\u2019s largest tech businesses, including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, sometimes pay millions of dollars a year to A.I. experts, effectively cornering the market for this hard-to-find talent. The shortage isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, just because mastering these skills takes years of work.This is not altruism. Researchers like Mr. Dean believe that if more people and companies are working on artificial intelligence, it will propel their own research. At the same time, companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft see serious money in the trend that Mr. Sirosh described. All of them are selling cloud-computing services that can help other businesses and developers build A.I.\u201cThere is real demand for this,\u201d said Matt Scott, a co-founder and the chief technical officer of Malong, a start-up in China that offers similar services. \u201cAnd the tools are not yet satisfying all the demand.\u201dEventually, the Google project will help companies build systems with artificial intelligence even if they don\u2019t have extensive expertise, Mr. Dean said. Today, he estimated, no more than a few thousand companies have the right talent for building A.I., but many more have the necessary data.\u201cWe want to go from thousands of organizations solving machine learning problems to millions,\u201d he said.Google is investing heavily in cloud-computing services \u2014 services that help other businesses build and run software \u2014 which it expects to be one of its primary economic engines in the years to come. And after snapping up such a large portion of the world\u2019s top A.I researchers, it has a means of jump-starting this engine.By analyzing the sounds in a vast collection of old technical support calls, for instance, a machine-learning algorithm can learn to recognize spoken words.But building a neural network is not like building a website or some run-of-the-mill smartphone app. It requires significant math skills, extreme trial and error, and a fair amount of intuition. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagn\u00e9, the chief executive of an independent machine-learning lab called Element AI, refers to the process as \u201ca new kind of computer programming.\u201dIn building a neural network, researchers run dozens or even hundreds of experiments across a vast network of machines, testing how well an algorithm can learn a task like recognizing an image or translating from one language to another. Then they adjust particular parts of the algorithm over and over again, until they settle on something that works. Some call it a \u201cdark art,\u201d just because researchers find it difficult to explain why they make particular adjustments.But with AutoML, Google is trying to automate this process. It is building algorithms that analyze the development of other algorithms, learning which methods are successful and which are not. Eventually, they learn to build more effective machine learning. Google said AutoML could now build algorithms that, in some cases, identified objects in photos more accurately than services built solely by human experts.Barret Zoph, one of the Google researchers behind the project, believes that the same method will eventually work well for other tasks, like speech recognition or machine translation.Many believe such methods will significantly accelerate the progress of A.I. in both the online and physical worlds. At the University of California, Berkeley, researchers are building techniques that could allow robots to learn new tasks based on what they have learned in the past.\u201cComputers are going to invent the algorithms for us, essentially,\u201d said a Berkeley professor, Pieter Abbeel. \u201cAlgorithms invented by computers can solve many, many problems very quickly \u2014 at least that is the hope.\u201dThis is also a way of expanding the number of people and businesses that can build artificial intelligence. These methods will not replace A.I. researchers entirely. Experts, like those at Google, must still do much of the important design work. But the belief is that the work of a few experts can help many others build their own software.Renato Negrinho, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who is exploring technology similar to AutoML, said this was not a reality today but should be in the years to come. \u201cIt is just a matter of when,\u201d he said.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a researcher for Google. He is Sergey Levine, not Levin. The caption also included an outdated credential for him. He is an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, not a post-doctoral researcher there.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Opens Door to More Consolidation in TV Business", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to allow a single company to own a newspaper and television and radio stations in the same town, reversing a decades-old rule aimed at preventing any individual or company from having too much power over local coverage.The vote was the latest action in a deregulatory blitz at the agency cheered on by media, broadband and cable corporations, but opposed by many Democrats and consumer advocates, who say Americans will be hurt from greater consolidation in those industries.Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump, has said the media ownership rules \u2014 including the cross-ownership ban between newspapers and television and radio stations \u2014 was outdated. He said most Americans get their news from a variety of sources and, most prominent among them, online platforms like Facebook and Google.Local media organizations, he has argued, would have a greater shot at competing against those internet giants by combining resources in local markets.\u201cIt\u2019s a simple proposition: The media ownership regulations of 2017 should match the media marketplace of 2017,\u201d Mr. Pai said on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s the proposition the F.C.C. vindicates today \u2014 nothing more, nothing less. And it\u2019s about time.\u201dDemocrats on the commission said that rolling back the rules would hurt people who relied on local stations for news coverage.\u201cDuring the first 10 months of 2017, the F.C.C. majority has given the green light to more than a dozen actions that are a direct attack on consumers and small businesses,\u201d said Mignon Clyburn, a Democratic commissioner, who voted against the orders. \u201cAnd most Americans are unaware that the agency established to protect the public interest has traded in that role for the chance to grant the wish lists of billion-dollar companies.\u201dPublic interest groups fear major corporations like Sinclair or CBS would grow more powerful through the relaxation of rules. Private equity investors who have purchased television stations and newspapers to flip them for a profit are also expected to take advantage of the changes.\u201cOur media ownership numbers are already dismally low,\u201d said Carmen Scurato, the director for the National Hispanic Media Coalition, a nonprofit that promotes greater diversity in media. \u201cThese actions on Thursday shut out our voices.\u201dSome academics are skeptical that the relaxation in rules will result in more robust local news coverage, as Mr. Pai envisions.There is little evidence that mergers in local media have resulted in more jobs and stronger journalism, said Victor Pickard, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. Instead, the relaxation of rules could result in business models like that of Sinclair, which sends programming created from its station in Washington to be run at stations across the nation, critics of the changes have said.\u201cMedia concentration has been a concern since the 1940s, and this is a major reversal,\u201d Mr. Pickard said. He added that internet platforms did not create news content on their own so were not real competition to broadcast journalism.\u201cThe fact that media content is coming from many sources, including the internet, isn\u2019t evidence of real competition because that isn\u2019t where actual journalism is coming from,\u201d Mr. Pickard said.Mr. Pai has rebutted the claims of coordination with Sinclair.It is unclear who would first take advantage of the new rules. But a company like Sinclair could benefit from the elimination of a rule that prevents one entity from owning two top stations in a local market. Through its Tribune deal, Sinclair would have about 10 markets with more than one of the four top stations. And with the new rules, it may not have to divest those stations, some analysts say.The National Association of Broadcasters, the lobbying group for television and radio broadcast station and network owners, said the rules would also help small, independent television owners, who have gone in to lobby Mr. Pai to support the changes.\u201cThe F.C.C.\u2019s past decisions retaining the local ownership rules depended upon the agency closing its eyes and covering its ears to avoid recognizing what is clear to any consumer with a TV remote or a smartphone \u2014 that local broadcast stations and newspapers do not exist in a vacuum and that broadcasters and newspaper owners must compete with myriad other outlets for viewers, listeners, readers and advertisers,\u201d the group said in a blog post.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside the Revolution at Etsy", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe first time Josh Silverman addressed the staff of Etsy as their newly installed chief executive, he tried to connect with a work force known for its diversity, idealism and sincerity.\u201cHello,\u201d he said. \u201cMy name is Josh. I identify as male. My preferred pronouns are \u2018him\u2019 and \u2018he.\u2019 Most people just call me Josh.\u201dIt was May 3, and Mr. Silverman was speaking to a roomful of traumatized employees. The day before, Etsy had fired 80 people, the first big layoffs at the online marketplace for handmade and vintage arts and crafts. Among those ousted was Etsy\u2019s beloved chief executive of six years, Chad Dickerson.Now Mr. Silverman \u2014 an Etsy board member but an unknown to most employees \u2014 stood in the Etsytorium, trying to win over a hostile crowd. His earnest introduction was an olive branch of sorts, an effort to signal that he was attuned to Etsy\u2019s vibrant gay and transgender community, and would be respectful of the company\u2019s distinctive culture. But to many in attendance, his remarks came off as tone deaf, and his inability to read the room foreshadowed sweeping changes that would soon transform Etsy.On the same day as the chief executive changeover, the company announced its first layoffs. Within weeks of assuming control, Mr. Silverman shut down several projects that had been in the works for months. Not long after that, he fired another 140 employees.It was a dizzying series of events at a company that has long held itself up as a paragon of righteous business practices. Etsy\u2019s founders believed its business model \u2014 helping mostly female entrepreneurs make a living online \u2014 was inherently just. Employees shared their emotions freely, often crying at the office. Perks included generous paid parental leave, free organic food and a pet-friendly workplace. Etsy was certified as a B Corp by a nonprofit called B Lab, denoting its particularly high social and environmental standards.But once Etsy went public in 2015, it was evaluated just like any other company traded on the stock market. By late last year, expenses were growing fast. And even as the company reported $88 million in revenues during the third quarter, it posted a net loss of $2.5 million. After a few quarters of tepid results, investors grew impatient and a classic clash of corporate governance came spilling into view \u2014 how would a company like Etsy balance the short-term demands of its shareholders with its high-minded long-term mission?By some important metrics, Etsy appears to be improving under Mr. Silverman\u2019s leadership. Revenues are up, as are \u201cgross merchandise sales\u201d \u2014 the total value of goods being sold on Etsy. The company\u2019s stock has risen about 50 percent in the six months since he took over.By other measures, however, Etsy is barely recognizable. The \u201cValues-Aligned Business\u201d team, which oversaw the company\u2019s social and environmental efforts, was dismantled. A new focus on profitability has sapped many employees of their enthusiasm. A workplace that once encouraged workers to express their feelings has clammed up. Etsy is no longer a B Corp.Today, as Mr. Silverman continues to push for change and investors keep close watch on the stock, what\u2019s most frustrating to some close observers of the company is that Etsy seems to have given up so much to gain so little.As Etsy grew, it eschewed traditional corporate customs in favor of a more freewheeling approach. Building consensus was more important than moving fast. Employees believed Etsy could be equally beneficial to buyers, sellers, staff and the planet. The idealism was infectious, and many people turned down higher salaries from other companies to work for Etsy.Yet for all its efforts to stand apart, Etsy followed the established playbook when it came to financing its growth. Venture capitalists poured some $85 million into the company, making a takeover or initial public offering all but inevitable.In 2011, the board decided to replace Mr. Kalin with Mr. Dickerson, who was then the chief technology officer. As C.E.O., Mr. Dickerson oversaw dramatic growth. When he took Etsy public in 2015, the company had 1.4 million active sellers, nearly 20 million buyers and had gross merchandise sales of $2 billion a year.True to form, Etsy found ways to make its initial public offering inclusive. It marketed shares to small investors and Etsy sellers and tried to concentrate shares in a smaller than usual number of institutional holders. Besides upholding the company\u2019s egalitarian ethos, the effort had a strategic rationale. The hope was that such a shareholder base might insulate Etsy from some of the short-term pressures of the stock market.Yet even as Etsy grew to number more than 1,000 staffers, the company\u2019s unorthodox culture survived. Mr. Dickerson held weekly \u201cOffice Hours,\u201d when any employee could ask him about anything, and spoke openly about his doubts, admitting when he didn\u2019t know the answer to a question.The emotional, individualistic culture had its drawbacks. The emphasis on go-it-alone craftsmanship meant Etsy managed its own data centers, instead of using more efficient options like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. With everyone empowered to express themselves, there was a lot of sharing going on. Inboxes were stuffed with unnecessary emails, which dragged on productivity.Mr. Silverman said he came to his first board meeting prepared to listen. But in the Etsy boardroom, seated around a large custom-made table featuring gold inlay, a large owl sculpture looming over the directors, he said he was troubled by what he heard from Mr. Dickerson. Expenses were growing faster than revenues. Sales on the site were up, but the rate of growth was slowing.As Mr. Dickerson tried to move the meeting on to topics including international expansion, Mr. Silverman spoke up. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re big at all,\u201d he told the board. \u201cWe\u2019re at the early stages.\u201dMr. Silverman pressed Mr. Dickerson to get more aggressive about the rate of growth, and called for a renewed focus on increasing sales. Privately, he came away concerned about the company\u2019s trajectory. \u201cThere was not a sense of crisis,\u201d Mr. Silverman said.\u201cThe house was burning and nobody was paying attention,\u201d said Fred Wilson, the co-founder of Union Square Ventures, which was an early investor in Etsy, and the board chairman. \u201cChad got the company about as far as he was going to get it. We needed somebody to take it to the next level.\u201dInstead of the soft skills that Mr. Dickerson brought, the board wanted someone with experience in marketing, software and e-commerce, someone who was comfortable at a big public company. In other words, someone like Mr. Silverman.At 4 p.m. on Tuesday, May 2, Mr. Dickerson called an emergency meeting in the Etsytorium, a cavernous conference room inside headquarters. Usually a loose public speaker, Mr. Dickerson read from a script, his voice shaking as he made an announcement: He was laying off 80 employees \u2014 the largest cuts in Etsy\u2019s history. And, he said, he had been fired by the board.Mr. Dickerson broke into tears, and sat down to steady himself. Many in the audience openly wept.Mr. Dickerson had learned that he was being replaced only days earlier, and his termination was effective immediately. Even by the unsentimental standards of corporate America, it was an abrupt transition. That night, a large contingent went drinking at local beer garden.The next morning, Mr. Dickerson, Mr. Silverman and Mr. Wilson all addressed the company. Mr. Dickerson told the crowd he was hung over. Mr. Wilson made some perfunctory remarks. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to blame anyone for this decision, I want you to blame me,\u201d he said.Finally, Mr. Silverman took the microphone, addressing his new staff for the first time. After introducing himself (and noting his gender), Mr. Silverman spoke about his background and experience. He said he wanted to preserve what was best about Etsy and help the company grow.When he began taking questions, the room turned hostile.\u201cYesterday felt impersonal, unempathetic and decidedly un-Etsy,\u201d the first employee said, according to a recording of the meeting. \u201cWhat is the new leadership planning to do to earn our trust and maintain the empathetic and human culture that is the entire reason that many of us chose to work here?\u201d\u201cTrust is earned, not granted,\u201d Mr. Silverman replied. \u201cKeep an open mind, and we\u2019ll get to know each other.\u201dEmployees saw Mr. Dickerson one last time. The next Friday, he came back to the office to give a Last Lecture, a traditional Etsy send-off. Mr. Dickerson spoke openly about his personal life and his time with Etsy. Everybody cried.Mr. Silverman wasted no time making changes. His sole focus, he said, was speeding up the pace of sales growth.He identified 30 projects that had the best chance of boosting sales on the site. Etsy began giving buyers more assurances, telling them that it didn\u2019t share credit card information with sellers, and that the company would refund their purchases if something went wrong. It began encouraging sellers to compare prices before listing an item. And for the first time, Etsy is running sales and promoting the holidays. Each of these changes, Mr. Silverman said, resulted in modest but measurable sales increases.Not everything worked. A move to display all-inclusive pricing, instead of the cost of the good and shipping separately, hurt sales and upset sellers. And a new way of displaying search filters didn\u2019t move the needle. \u201cMore than half of the things we try don\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying things.\u201dOther projects were shut down. Etsy Studio, a new marketplace for arts and crafts supplies that had consumed significant resources, was sidelined. Plans for further international expansion were put on hold. A marketing campaign was scrapped.At the same time, Mr. Silverman began redrawing what he said was a convoluted organizational chart. Too many people were managers, he said, and too many managers had too few reports. On June 21, less than two months after taking over, Mr. Silverman announced another, larger round of layoffs.Despite the tumult, Mr. Silverman said progress was being made as small tweaks to the site began to pay off. \u201cWe subtracted people and we\u2019re getting a lot more done,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more focus, a lot more urgency.\u201dSeveral current Etsy employees said they appreciated a new sense of direction and accountability, and that the company was becoming more innovative. \u201cThe tolerance for risk has gone up significantly,\u201d said Linda Kozlowski, the chief operating officer. \u201cThere\u2019s been a cultural shift of accountability in a good way.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re doing their best to mimic eBay and Amazon,\u201d said Amy Stringer-Mowat, co-founder of American Heirloom, a Brooklyn company that makes customized bamboo cutting boards. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bite the hand that feeds you, but that\u2019s the best way to describe how I feel about what\u2019s going on.\u201dMs. Stringer-Mowat\u2019s company got started on Etsy, but she said sales on the site have slumped in recent months. She stopped hearing from Etsy employees in the marketing department who had helped her promote her business, and she said Etsy was pressuring her to offer cheaper shipping rates, which cuts into her profits.Mr. Silverman insists Etsy is still a mission-driven company. Many of the perks remain in place, and the company is lobbying in Washington, including for the protection of net neutrality. But Mr. Silverman says Etsy\u2019s greatest potential for impact is helping sellers \u2014 many of whom are women running small businesses \u2014 increase their sales. \u201cThe company had the best of intentions, but wasn\u2019t great at tying that to impact,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cBeing good doesn\u2019t cut the mustard.\u201dOn the afternoon of Nov. 6, Etsy reported strong quarterly earnings. Sales, revenues and adjusted profits were all up. In after-hours trading, Etsy shares spiked. When the markets opened the next morning, however, the stock slumped. The results, fine as they were, were not good enough.Three days later, Mr. Silverman was back in the Etsytorium, addressing his staff. The quarter was proof that changes to the company were paying off, he said, suggesting that the tumult of the past six months had not been in vain. \u201cThe quarter that we just reported, that you all worked so hard to deliver, means so much to Etsy and to all the people who rely on us,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cI\u2019m super fired up.\u201dEtsy will likely grow with Mr. Silverman as chief executive, but it may never again be the sensitive community fostered by Mr. Kalin and nurtured by Mr. Dickerson. Once a beacon of socially responsible business practices with a starry-eyed work force that believed it could fundamentally reimagine commerce, Etsy has over the past year become a case study in how the short-term pressures of the stock market can transform even the most idealistic of companies.\u201cThere\u2019s only so much wiggle room as a public company,\u201d said Mr. Stinchcomb, the early employee. \u201cIf you really want to build a company that works for people and the planet, capitalism isn\u2019t the solution.\u201dMr. Wilson, the chairman of the board, dismisses that as sentimental hooey.\u201cTo all the people who say taking Etsy public was a mistake, I say that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201c There are some people who will say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not right for me. I like the old culture.\u2019 Well, I\u2019m sorry about that. Going public was the best thing that ever happened to this company.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is Ceding Global Leadership to China", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Amid the pomp that President Xi Jinping of China is bestowing upon his visiting American counterpart, President Trump, it\u2019s hard not to see two leaders \u2014 and two countries \u2014 heading in very different directions.Mr. Xi emerged from last month\u2019s Communist Party Congress the undisputed master of the Middle Kingdom. \u201cXi Jinping Thought\u201d was enshrined in the party constitution \u2014 an honor previously granted only to Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Breaking with precedent, Mr. Xi neglected to anoint a successor \u2014 a big hint that he feels emboldened to extend his rule beyond the second five-year term he has just begun. The Economist heralded Mr. Xi with an honorific usually reserved for America\u2019s president: the world\u2019s most powerful man.Mr. Trump stepped off Air Force One in Beijing on Wednesday with historically low job-approval ratings, just hours after suffering a shellacking in off-year elections. His credibility is cratering abroad \u2014 polls have shown a drop in confidence in American leadership.As the personal trajectories of Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi diverge, so too does the focus of their leadership. While Mr. Trump is obsessed with building walls, Mr. Xi is busy building bridges.At the World Economic Forum in January, Mr. Xi proclaimed China the new champion of free trade and globalization. His \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative \u2014 with funding from the made-in-Beijing Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank \u2014 will invest $1 trillion in linking Asia with Europe through a network of sea routes, roads, railways and, yes, bridges. China will gain access to resources, export its excess industrial capacity and peacefully secure strategic footholds from which to project power.While Mr. Trump shuns multilateralism and global governance, Mr. Xi increasingly embraces them.The Trump administration has belittled the United Nations, withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, jettisoned America\u2019s commitment to the Paris climate accord, tried to renege on the nuclear deal with Iran, questioned America\u2019s core alliances in Europe and Asia, disparaged the World Trade Organization and multicountry trade deals, and sought to shut the door on immigrants.Mr. Xi? He has grabbed leadership of the climate-change agenda, embraced the World Trade Organization\u2019s dispute-resolution system and increased China\u2019s voting shares at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Beijing is forging ahead with a trade pact that would include the major Asian economies plus Australia and New Zealand, but not the United States. China is now one of the leading contributors to the United Nations budget and peacekeeping operations. And Mr. Xi is making a determined play to attract the world\u2019s cutting-edge scientists and innovators to China.At home, Mr. Xi is making strategic investments that could allow China to dominate the 21st-century global economy, including in information technology and artificial intelligence \u2014 where, Eric Schmidt of Google has warned, China is poised to overtake the United States in the next decade. Mr. Xi is all-in on robotics, aerospace, high-speed rail, new-energy vehicles and advanced medical products.Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cstrategic\u201d investments \u2014 in coal and a quixotic effort to bring back manufacturing lost to automation \u2014 would make the United States the champion of the 20th-century economy.All of this positions China to become, in Mr. Xi\u2019s words, \u201ca new choice for other countries\u201d and the principal arbiter of something long associated with the United States: the international order. China has a profound stake in that order and a globalized world: It needs access to advanced technology and the export markets upon which its growth depends.The contradictions at the heart of China\u2019s enterprise could still prove to be its undoing. Beijing continues to fence off key sectors of its economy to foreign investment. It imposes draconian requirements on foreign companies \u2014 like requiring them to take on a Chinese partner and hand over their technology and intellectual property \u2014 that other countries do not impose on Chinese companies.Beijing\u2019s foreign investments can be coercive and exploitative \u2014 using Chinese laborers and contractors instead of local ones, saddling poorer countries with enormous debts, leaving behind shoddy workmanship and fueling corruption.Mr. Xi\u2019s ability to sustain the outward projection of Chinese influence is also challenged by his country\u2019s systemic weaknesses. A mountain of debt. Rising inequality. Slowing growth, dragged down by an aging population, lower productivity and inefficient state-owned enterprises. Poisonous air and scarce water. And an increasingly repressive system that may appeal to fellow authoritarians but not to Chinese citizens.But China\u2019s shortcomings may not matter in the absence of a compelling alternative. I\u2019d never bet against the United States, but if the Trump-led retreat into nationalism, protectionism, unilateralism and xenophobia continues, China\u2019s model could carry the day.The world is not self-organizing. And American stewardship of the international order advanced liberal values and progressive norms \u2014 democracy, human rights, freedom of speech and assembly, protections for workers, the environment and intellectual property. By abdicating the leadership role it has played since World War II, the United States is giving the terrain to others who will do the organizing on the basis of their values, not America\u2019s.Mr. Xi is not shy about who that someone else will be. With Mr. Trump ceding ground to China, the liberal international order that defined the second half of the 20th century could give way to an illiberal one.An earlier version of this article misidentified the the document that was revised to reflect President Xi Jinping\u2019s increased power. It was the Communist Party\u2019s constitution, not the country\u2019s.Antony J. Blinken, a deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration, a managing director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and a co-founder of WestExec Advisors, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Two Contrasting Views of Silicon Valley\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryThe pervasive influence of Silicon Valley on our economy, culture and politics is a subject worthy of close study. Two important new books released this week offer startlingly different approaches and conclusions on these complex issues. The contrasting epigraphs that begin the works perfectly reflect their respective perspectives.To be fair, the conflict in visions is less stark than it seems because the two authors are focused on different time periods. \u201cTroublemakers\u201d covers \u201cthe generational handoff\u201d that happened between the late 1960s and the early \u201980s \u201cas pioneers of the semiconductor industry passed the baton to younger up-and-comers.\u201d Mr. Cohen\u2019s ire primarily targets those \u201cwho helped nurture the World Wide Web to prosperity in the 1990s before turning to investing.\u201dOne does not have to be sympathetic to a more benign view of the technology industry to appreciate Ms. Berlin\u2019s deeply researched and dramatic narrative of Silicon Valley\u2019s early years in \u201cTroublemakers.\u201d To tell this story, she selects seven lesser-known but influential figures to follow closely throughout that period. These include the first woman to take a technology company public, the first chairman of Apple, and a man who played critical roles in government to create the internet and in industry to commercialize it through the personal computer. Their names will most likely be unfamiliar, but their meticulously told stories permit the reader to gain a nuanced understanding of the emergence of the broader technology ecosystem that has enabled Silicon Valley to thrive.Nuance is not a word that comes to mind in reading Mr. Cohen\u2019s attack on Silicon Valley\u2019s powers that be. The first two chapters are devoted to key figures in the history of Stanford\u2019s administration and computer science department, emphasizing both the university\u2019s willingness to trade off academic rigor for financial gain and its institutional sympathy for eugenics in the early 1900s and, more recently, extreme libertarianism. These underlying themes, in Mr. Cohen\u2019s view, underpin \u201cthe Stanford model of integrating the hacker and the entrepreneur.\u201d This model is reflected in staking William Hewlett and David Packard in the 1930s, establishing the Stanford Industrial Park in the 1950s and obtaining a $336 million payout from Google stock in return for granting the exclusive PageRank license.It is this unholy alliance between hacker and entrepreneur values that Mr. Cohen rails against for the balance of the book. Although he pauses for a handful of pages to speak about Microsoft \u2014 \u201cIf the Know-It-Alls\u2019 values represent a merger of a hacker\u2019s radical individualism and an entrepreneur\u2019s greed, then only one man can be considered their forefather: Bill Gates\u201d \u2014 he believes that the negative ramifications \u201conly fully flourished with the widespread adoption of the World Wide Web starting in the late 1990s.\u201d And so beginning with Marc Andreessen, who developed the first commercialized web browser, Netscape Navigator, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d proceeds to attack the character of just about every boldfaced name among tech billionaires. All are found guilty of either always promoting the insidious tech dogma that places no constraints on their ability to disrupt the status quo for their own financial gain or \u2014 as in the case of the once idealistic founders of Google and Facebook \u2014 having along the way been \u201cseduced by the power and money offered by venture capitalists.\u201dThe history that underpins that overarching thesis feels both selective and less than rigorous. Niels Reimers, the founder of Stanford\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing and one of the seven key industry figures profiled in detail in \u201cTroublemakers,\u201d is not even mentioned in \u201cThe-Know-It-Alls.\u201d Given the complex negotiations required to secure university approval, this seems like a significant oversight for a book whose thesis hinges in part on Stanford\u2019s supposed unthinking commercialism. And statements like computer science was \u201cstill something of an obscure discipline in the late 1980s\u201d just don\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. By 1990, there were almost 800 computer science degree programs offered at colleges and universities, enrolling tens of thousands of students.Although Mr. Cohen has identified legitimately disturbing aspects of the tech culture, he becomes repetitive, and his tone is unnecessarily conspiratorial. He also ignores when the facts contradict his assertions. Mr. Cohen complains about the \u201cPayPal mafia,\u201d former employees who \u201cprovided each other with cash, counsel and contacts.\u201d Mr. Cohen finds \u201csomething jarring about a group of self-styled survival of the fittest free marketeers committing to a strategy of collective risk and mutual support.\u201dWhen the Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is profiled as a contrast to the libertarian fanaticism and raw commercialism of the Know-It-Alls, his inability to raise funding is used to reinforce this point: \u201cWales and his partners had no rich friends to lean on in tough times.\u201d The narrative makes clear, however, that his problem was a flawed business model, not his lack of access to the PayPal mafia or other venture investors. Similarly, Mr. Cohen does not directly confront the irony that the story of Wikipedia\u2019s ultimate success was made possible only by its free-riding on Google\u2019s powerful \u2014 but in his view morally suspect \u2014 search engine.The tech industry has earned a takedown book that documents its self-interested justifications for any number of policies that are clearly not in the public interest. Its track record on matters including cybersecurity, gender equality and privacy is shameful. The brief profiles of \u201cThe Know-It Alls,\u201d sprinkled with gratuitous ad hominem observations (for example, Mr. Cohen writes that PayPal is responsible for \u201creleasing into the wild a self-satisfied Peter Thiel, a one-man wrecking crew who has been sowing chaos through American society up to this very day\u201d), do not get the job done.Given the profound impact on our lives of the technology industry and the apparent flaws in its current culture, both books leave the reader wondering where to go from here. \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d suggests that \u201cEurope provides a model\u201d relying on extensive regulation but, given the absence of any European tech giants of note, this seems like throwing the baby out with the bath water. Although the compelling history in \u201cTroublemakers\u201d provides a number of tantalizing clues as to where things got off track, this is not the focus of the book. Ms. Berlin does not whitewash the aspects of even the valley\u2019s early years that foreshadow the more profound cultural issues to emerge in the industry\u2019s middle age, writing, \u201cIt takes a certain kind of audacity to think you can launch a company, much less invent an industry \u2014 and audacity often veers into arrogance.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t go out of her way to explore their implications, either.When the founding of Fairchild Semiconductor is discussed, William Shockley is mentioned in passing, but Ms. Berlin notes that he \u201chad not yet fully descended into the paranoia and eugenic fervor that would later mar his reputation.\u201d In fact, his paranoia and abusiveness at least were already well known and, given that these qualities have been recurring contemporary industry themes, would have been worth examining.Similarly, when it\u2019s noted that a key to the venture capitalist Don Valentine\u2019s success was his willingness to overlook \u201cdeviant\u201d behavior, some discussion of the downside of letting the hacker culture run wild might have made sense.Silicon Valley\u2019s history is still being written. Both of these books are important reminders that whether or not it is ultimately a story with a happy ending will be a function of our collective willingness to closely examine the sector\u2019s origins to better understand not only the sources of innovation but how the most destructive aspects of the culture were allowed to fester for so long.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Get High Marks for Covering Infertility Treatments", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserA relatively small number of companies offer generous benefits for infertility treatment to employees, while most have minimal or no coverage, a new report found.It\u2019s a case of \u201chaves and have-nots,\u201d said Jake Anderson, a founder of FertilityIQ, the start-up that wrote the report.It found that technology companies as well as employers in consulting and banking tended to offer generous coverage for costly assisted-reproduction techniques like in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F.FertilityIQ was founded by Mr. Anderson and Deborah Bialis, a married couple who saw a need for more detailed information after undergoing treatment for infertility themselves. FertilityIQ gathers information from more than 10,000 verified I.V.F. patients who contribute to its database. Employers examined in the report included companies where FertilityIQ\u2019s participants work, as well as additional employers identified by fertility clinics or researched by Fertility IQ itself, Mr. Anderson said.FertilityIQ\u2019s goal is to provide as much detail as possible, he said, to help people navigate their way through a stressful process. Mr. Anderson\u2019s advice to those seeking infertility treatment was simply, \u201cBuckle in, financially and emotionally.\u201dEmployer benefits are important, the couple said, because I.V.F. is costly and demand for it is increasing.Treatment isn\u2019t cheap. The cost of a single cycle of I.V.F. is often about $12,000, but that number is just a start. Drugs and related procedures, like genetic screening, push the average price in most major metropolitan areas to well above $20,000 per cycle, FertilityIQ found. And most couples undergo at least two cycles on average, Mr. Anderson said.The report ranks individual employers and broad sectors, based on criteria that include the value of the benefits and the ease with which employees can use them. Some companies rank higher because they avoid preauthorization rules, like trying unsuccessfully to conceive for a period of time or receiving a specific infertility diagnosis, that can be particularly restrictive for same-sex couples or single women, Mr. Anderson said.The technology industry, in particular, shines at making infertility benefits widely accessible, the report found, and some employers are in a sort of benefits arms race, offering more generous coverage to remain competitive in recruiting and retaining workers. Facebook ranks high on the list of tech companies, as it did in FertilityIQ\u2019s report last year. The company covers up to four I.V.F. cycles, including genetic testing, with no preapproval required. (FertilityIQ values the cycles at $25,000 each, for a total benefit value of $100,000.)Other tech companies are beefing up coverage, according to the new analysis.Microsoft is expanding its benefit in January, replacing a fixed amount of $15,000 with a more flexible offering. \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re providing industry-leading benefits,\u201d said Sonja Kellen, director of global health and wellness benefits at Microsoft.Microsoft will work with Progyny, a fertility benefits manager, to offer up to three treatment cycles. The benefit includes genetic testing as well as the freezing of eggs or embryos and storage for up to four years. The new policy makes treatment available to employees without demonstrated infertility issues, so gay couples pursuing parenthood through surrogacy or a single woman who wants to freeze eggs for use in the future can use the benefit.The new approach aims to make benefits more broadly available and helps reduce pressure on employees undergoing I.V.F. to maximize their benefit, Ms. Kellen said.For instance, a couple undergoing I.V.F. with a dollar cap on their employer benefit may decide to have multiple embryos transferred at one time, perhaps resulting in twins or triplets. Those pregnancies are more likely to have complications.Medications for the treatment are covered separately, through the company\u2019s prescription drug benefit, she said.Pinterest, the online social network, covered up to $20,000 for treatment costs this year, but will change its benefit in January to cover up to four rounds of I.V.F., said a company spokeswoman, Malorie Lucich. The expansion, she said, was based on feedback the company received from its 1,200 employees.\u201cIt\u2019s a very family friendly culture here,\u201d she said.Among other big tech companies, Google covers three cycles including genetic testing, a benefit that FertilityIQ values at $75,000, and Apple offers a $20,000 benefit. Neither company requires preapproval. Amazon\u2019s benefit of $15,000 with a required preauthorization placed it relatively low on FertilityIQ\u2019s list of tech companies.Some companies in consulting, like Bain, and finance, like Bank of America, offer unlimited I.V.F. benefits as long as employees meet preauthorization rules, the report found.Other financial companies offer more limited coverage, yet are moving to expand it. American Express, for instance, increased its cap for treatment this year to $35,000, up from $20,000, for full-time and part-time employees.Retail companies generally rank low on FertilityIQ\u2019s list, Mr. Anderson said, but Starbucks is notable for making a $15,000 I.V.F. benefit available, including to part-time store workers.Here are some questions and answers about infertility coverage:What should I do if my employer doesn\u2019t offer I.V.F. benefits?Employees can lobby their human resources departments to offer coverage, particularly if their employers are \u201cself insured\u201d \u2014 meaning the companies pay claims themselves, rather than paying a premium to an insurer, said Barbara Collura, president and chief executive of Resolve, an infertility support and advocacy group.Self-insured employers \u2014 typically companies with more than 250 workers \u2014 have more leeway to expand coverage, Ms. Collura said. Employers that don\u2019t self-insure have less flexibility because the benefits are determined by the insurer, she said.Eights states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island) require employers to offer some level of I.V.F. benefit, Ms. Collura said. But coverage isn\u2019t necessarily generous, and self-insured employers and small employers are typically exempt from the laws.Is financial help available for the cost of infertility treatment?What proportion of employers over all offer I.V.F. benefits?About a quarter of employers with 500 or more workers cover the procedure, while 37 percent of employers with 20,000 or more workers cover it, according to a 2017 report from the benefits consultant Mercer \u2014 about the same level found the previous year.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

When she was released about three months later, she was directed to a nearby nursing home. But off her medication for bipolar disorder and unwilling to accept help, she returned to the streets.\u201cI would just go anywhere,\u201d Ms. Gambal said. \u201cIn the winter, I would try to find someplace warm or I slept on the train. It was a really lost time for me.\u201dMs. Gambal grew up in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, in a boisterous household with her mother and a tightknit extended family. She said she had \u201cdabbled in poetry\u201d and creative writing as a student at the State University of New York at Purchase and earned a degree in fine arts from Brooklyn College in 2008.After graduating, she found steady work as an administrator at a law firm. And in her free time she would draw portraits and read \u201cA Confederacy of Dunces,\u201d John Kennedy Toole\u2019s tale of an isolated young man, again and again.Ms. Gambal learned she had bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after she had a mental breakdown at her law firm, she said. She sought medical help, but was let go during a round of layoffs. She then began a human resources role at Macy\u2019s, and, feeling confident in her progress, decided to go off her medication. Soon afterward, during the financial crisis, Ms. Gambal again lost her job.She began losing control of her life. Living alone in Brooklyn, she started having paranoid delusions, imagining that her phone was bugged, that she was being stalked and that her family and friends had turned against her, leading her to cut ties with them, Ms. Gambal said.\u201cIt just snowballed out of control,\u201d she added.Isolated and with no stable income, she became homeless at age 38.Several months later, feeling constricted and helpless inside a subway car crowded with strangers, Ms. Gambal had the stroke.As a result of the stroke, she walked with a limp and her right hand was numb. Her cognition was impaired, and Ms. Gambal, once outgoing and chatty, could at first not speak at all.\u201cI was hearing voices, I wasn\u2019t eating properly and I went off the edge,\u201d Ms. Gambal said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take it.\u201dShe very slowly began figuring out language again by listening to passers-by on the street. And after months of refusing assistance, she checked herself into a hospital for mental treatment for one year. From there, Ms. Gambal moved into a homeless shelter in Brooklyn and, once on Medicaid, sought occupational and speech therapy. She began rebuilding her cognitive skills by doing elementary-level math problems and by relearning every letter of the alphabet. Ms. Gambal said she had to relearn even how to write her own name: H-O-L-L-Y.\u201cI can\u2019t spell anymore,\u201d Ms. Gambal said. \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating.\u201dWhen she recently needed to write the word \u201cSeptember,\u201d Ms. Gambal said, she had to search the web.

{"Headline": "Rebuking Uber Lawyers, Judge Delays Trade Secrets Trial", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A letter that detailed a secretive effort at Uber to gather intelligence on competitors and cover its tracks has the ride-hailing company on the defensive in a legal fight that has gripped Silicon Valley since February.On Tuesday, the discovery of the letter caused a federal judge to delay a trade secrets trial \u2014 a day before jury selection was set to begin \u2014 between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet.\u201cI can no longer trust the words of the lawyers for Uber in this case,\u201d Judge Alsup said. \u201cIf even half of what is in that letter is true, it would be an injustice for Waymo to go to trial.\u201dWaymo sued Uber in February, claiming that a former engineer, Anthony Levandowski, conspired with Uber to steal trade secrets from Waymo. On Tuesday, Judge Alsup repeatedly rebuked Uber\u2019s lawyers for not sharing the document with the court. \u201cYou should have come clean with this long ago,\u201d he said.The letter was written in May or June by a lawyer for Richard Jacobs, a former Uber employee, to Angela Padilla, deputy general counsel at Uber. Uber hired Mr. Jacobs in March 2016 as its manager of global intelligence and fired him in April of this year, Mr. Jacobs testified in court on Tuesday. He is now a paid security consultant for Uber, after receiving a $4.5 million settlement following his dismissal.In discussions with other Uber employees, Mr. Jacobs testified, he learned of an internal organization that gathered trade secrets, code and other information about its competitors. It was called the \u201cmarketplace analytics team,\u201d according to the letter, which had been redacted by Uber. The group frequented the code-sharing site GitHub, searching for private material that may have been accidentally revealed by competitors.This Uber team also led efforts \u201cto evade, impede, obstruct, influence several ongoing lawsuits against Uber,\u201d according to the letter. The team also tried to find out what other companies were doing. And in 2016, Uber hired a man named Ed Russo to help recruit employees of competitors to steal trade secrets, according to the letter.This group relied on \u201canonymous\u201d servers separate from the rest of the Uber network, and some employees were expected to rely on devices that encrypted or automatically deleted messages after a certain amount of time, Mr. Jacobs testified. Email was a last resort.This system, Mr. Jacobs said in his testimony, \u201cwas to ensure there was no paper trail that would come back to haunt the company in any criminal or civil litigation.\u201dMr. Jacobs said this effort focused solely on overseas competitors and that he was not aware of the unit obtaining trade secrets from Waymo or other competitors in the United States. That contradicted an assertion in his letter, which said he was aware that this team had at least stolen trade secrets from Waymo.Waymo claims in its suit that Mr. Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files from company servers before leaving the Alphabet unit and eventually joining the autonomous vehicle project at Uber.The involvement of the United States attorney\u2019s office is a peculiar twist, because federal prosecutors do not usually get involved in civil trials between two companies. The inclusion of the letter suggests that federal authorities discovered it during their own investigation into Uber\u2019s business practices.What the United States attorney\u2019s office is investigating is unclear. A spokesman for the office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u201cThe evidence brought to light over the weekend by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office and revealed, in part, today in court is significant and troubling,\u201d said Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman. \u201cThe continuance we were granted gives us the opportunity to fully investigate this new, highly relevant information.\u201dThis is not the first time the United States attorney\u2019s office has been involved in the case. Earlier in the year, Judge Alsup, citing what he said was compelling evidence against Mr. Levandowski connected to the theft of trade secrets, referred the matter to federal authorities.In May, Uber fired Mr. Levandowski after he failed to turn over evidence related to the suit, citing his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.An Uber spokeswoman said nothing that Mr. Jacobs said on Tuesday impacted the merits of the case against the company. \u201cJacobs himself said on the stand today that he was not aware of any Waymo trade secrets being stolen,\u201d said Chelsea Kohler, the company spokeswoman.The systems Mr. Jacobs described seemed to mirror those uncovered by reporters over the last year. In April, it was revealed that Uber used an elaborate system to track and sabotage Lyft, a top competitor in the ride-hailing business.The letter from Mr. Jacobs\u2019s lawyer, parts of which were read in court, also said three Uber employees had gone to Pittsburgh to instruct the company\u2019s autonomous vehicle group, which is testing self-driving cars in the city. The research group was told to use the special communication practices with the Uber security group to prevent sensitive information from emerging in potential legal disputes.Mr. Jacobs said in testimony on Tuesday that an outside company had supplied Uber with devices for hiding communications. The company also ran a separate effort to hide communications via Wickr, a service that deletes communications after a given amount of time, he said.Judge Alsup asked Uber\u2019s lawyers to supply an unredacted copy of the letter from Mr. Jacobs\u2019s lawyer and a list of all Uber employees who used the Wickr service, including employees with the autonomous vehicle group in Pittsburgh. The judge also said he was considering making the entire letter public.Mr. Russo, who works on Uber\u2019s security team, provided an alternative version to the events Mr. Jacobs described. In testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Russo said the team did not gather information from people at competitors and did not steal trade secrets. Mr. Russo acknowledged that he had worked with some of the security companies that Mr. Jacobs mentioned during his testimony.Mr. Jacobs testified that Uber demoted and later fired him after he refused to embrace the company\u2019s security techniques. Two people familiar with his employment at Uber, however, said he was discovered downloading files that he was not authorized to access on Uber\u2019s network, an offense the company considered cause for dismissal.Mr. Jacobs said he later reached the $4.5 million settlement with Uber that stipulated he would not discuss the company\u2019s practices with the media, but he believed that this did not prevent him from discussing the situation as a part of a criminal investigation. Mr. Jacobs traveled by plane from Seattle for the hearing, and he testified that Uber paid his way.Because of an editing error, a capsule summary with an earlier version of this article misstated who had written a letter detailing secretive efforts by Uber to monitor competitors. It was written by a lawyer for a former Uber employee, not the employee himself.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetzMike Isaac and Nicole Perlroth contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If No One Owns the Moon, Can Anyone Make Money Up There?", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "Ambiguities in the 50-year-old Outer Space Treaty may be getting in the way of entrepreneurs seeking opportunities elsewhere in our solar system.Supported byMoon Express would not need all of these facilities if its only goal were to win the Lunar X Prize.Its second spacecraft aims to land in 2019 near the moon\u2019s south pole. A third, larger spacecraft in 2020 is to gather samples and then bring them back to Earth, the first haul of moon rocks since a Soviet robotic probe\u2019s return in 1976.But these plans almost came to a halt a couple of years ago \u2014 not because of technological challenges or financial shortfalls, but because of an international agreement known as the Outer Space Treaty, which is marking its 50th anniversary this year.The treaty spells out what countries are and are not allowed to do in space. Its crowning achievement was stopping the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union from expanding into space.But the agreement may now be getting in the way of entrepreneurs with plans to push farther and faster into space than national agencies like NASA.\u201cBefore it was something really, really hypothetical,\u201d said Fabio Tronchetti, a law professor at Harbin Institute of Technology in China. \u201cBut now there are groups that are really serious. It changes everything.\u201dRobert D. Richards, Moon Express\u2019s chief executive \u2014 whose business plan is \u201cto expand Earth\u2019s economic sphere to the moon and beyond\u201d \u2014 is far from the only entrepreneur looking for business opportunities beyond our planet.As these companies go where no businesses have gone before, they raise questions only fuzzily addressed by the Outer Space Treaty: What are private companies allowed to do in space? Can a company mine the moon or an asteroid and then sell what it has pulled out? How are countries to regulate these businesses?Internationally, countries have been discussing how to answer these questions. In the United States, Congress has begun tackling regulatory issues. Some warn that if the United States does not set up business-friendly policies, then the start-ups could move elsewhere \u2014 including such seemingly unlikely places as Luxembourg.The treaty also prohibited nations from making any claim of sovereignty over any part of the rest of the solar system.Moon Express ran into a bureaucratic wall because the treaty declares that activities of nongovernmental entities \u2014 a classification that includes commercial companies \u2014 \u201crequire authorization and continuing supervision\u201d of the government. (The United States had insisted on the clause, rejecting the Soviet view that space exploration should be limited to governments.)The Federal Aviation Administration licenses rocket launches and re-entry of commercial spacecraft from orbit in order to ensure the safety of people on the ground. The Federal Communications Commission regulates communications satellites, and the Department of Commerce regulates commercial remote sensing satellites.But the United States does not as yet have a process for authorizing or supervising novel endeavors like a private company landing on the moon.In announcing the decision, however, the F.A.A. said the approval applied only to this one Moon Express launch, and that not even Moon Express could count on a favorable outcome in the future.Moon Express has begun discussions with the F.A.A. for the second trip to the lunar south pole, and Dr. Richards is confident that the company could successfully pull off its first three flights via the current regulatory patchwork.But if Congress and the president do not come up with a better solution, Moon Express, SpaceX, Blue Origin and the rest of the emerging industry could run into more bureaucratic walls, and companies might start looking for other places to set up shop.Dr. Richards said he remained optimistic.\u201cEach company is moving forward with some assumption of risk but a presumption of the U.S. government coming through with frameworks that allow that to happen,\u201d Dr. Richards said in October during a visit at his company\u2019s Florida headquarters.Planetary Resources\u2019s goal is to mine the solar system\u2019s asteroids. Luxembourg, a nation smaller than Rhode Island with a long history in mining, has bet 200 million euros \u2014 more than $225 million \u2014 on this industry that does not exist. That includes $28 million invested in Planetary Resources. In return, Luxembourg owns a 10 percent share of the company, said Etienne Schneider, the country\u2019s deputy prime minister.Back in April, Luxembourg\u2019s crown prince, his wife and government officials paid a visit to Planetary Resources, putting on white gowns, gloves, wispy caps and baby blue bootees \u2014 a distinctly unroyal outfit sometimes called a \u201cbunny suit\u201d \u2014 to take a close look at where the company is assembling small satellites.In June, Mr. Schneider returned to the United States to host a symposium with a roomful of bankers and venture capitalists, a vivid demonstration that private space investment has reached a tipping point of credibility.A Goldman Sachs report about innovative space businesses that came out in the spring seemed to agree. \u201cSpace mining could be more realistic than perceived,\u201d the report said. \u201cWhile the psychological barrier to mining asteroids is high, the actual financial and technological barriers are far lower.\u201dAt the Manhattan presentation, Mr. Schneider readily acknowledged that the notion of asteroid mining sounds like science fiction and that he often gets quizzical questions about why Luxembourg is spending money chasing this.Mr. Schneider recalled that during a visit to Silicon Valley in 2012, he met S. Pete Worden, then the director of the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., who suggested that Luxembourg look into asteroid mining.\u201cAt the time, I listened to him and wondered what this guy might have smoked,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.But more discussions and research convinced Mr. Schneider this was a promising possibility.For Planetary Resources, the first wave of development is to culminate in a doughnut-shape spacecraft heading on a prospecting mission to a near-Earth asteroid in 2020.Sometime after that, the company hopes to mine in earnest \u2014 for seemingly mundane water ice. But water, in addition to potentially providing something to drink for astronauts, can be split into hydrogen and oxygen. Both can be used as rocket propellent; the oxygen, of course, also can provide air to breathe.As a business, Planetary Resources is betting that by the time it extracts water from an asteroid, there will be a customer like NASA interested in buying water, hydrogen and oxygen.Eventually, the company aims to extract platinum, currently worth more than $900 an ounce, and other precious metals.To make these pursuits easier, Luxembourg passed a space law that took effect this summer. Planetary Resources has set up its European office there. Moves like this one are in part motivating policymakers in the United States to devote more attention to American laws that currently govern commercial space activities.Ambiguities in the Outer Space Treaty currently create uncertainty over whether anyone can profit from such business ventures. Article II in particular states, \u201cOuter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.\u201dThis year, Congress is revisiting the Outer Space Treaty again, hoping to boost nascent space companies looking to push outward into the solar system.It would put the regulatory power in an Office of Space Commerce, which would have 60 days to decide whether to approve or deny a company\u2019s application. The full House has not yet taken up the bill, and the Senate is still working on its version.Officials at Moon Express and Planetary Resources say they do not want unfettered freedom in space, nor do they seek withdrawal from the Outer Space Treaty.\u201cOur goal is to have a space environment that is populated by people acting responsibly,\u201d said Peter Marquez, vice president for global engagement at Planetary Resources. \u201cIf there aren\u2019t any adults in the room, it concerns me. If it turns into the wild, wild West of just do whatever you want, then that kind of runs against concepts and precepts of Outer Space Treaty.\u201dThese companies do want the regulations to be \u201clight-touch\u201d and hope that the default inclination of the U.S. government will be to say yes.Once the price of transportation comes down, more business opportunities will open up, Dr. Richards said.The moon, peppered with the impacts of asteroids over the eons, should also possess dollops of platinum and other precious metals. Helium-3, embedded in the lunar crust by the solar wind, could be fuel for future fusion power plants.Moon Express\u2019s family of spacecraft could be a boon to scientists, sending low-cost probes not just to the moon but to other planets.Patches of eternal sunshine on the moon could be limited, valuable resources that nations and companies will someday squabble over.Dr. Richards compared this moment he sees coming to the 19th century California Gold Rush, when gold diggers jousted over the most lucrative places to sift ore. But he was confident that the new competitors would reach compromises.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be bad players per se, but there could be arguments over areas of operation overlap,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those are problems for the future, and that\u2019ll be a great problem to have.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the last time a spacecraft brought moon rocks back to Earth. It was a Soviet probe in 1976, not the last of NASA\u2019s Apollo missions. Additionally a picture used in an earlier version of this article misidentified the location of a visit by the Hereditary Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg. It was from their visit of SSL in California, not an earlier stop at Planetary Resources in Washington State.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Is Ignoring Anti-Abortion Fake News", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLast year, just weeks before the election, an article from a site called Mad World News began circulating around Facebook. The headline read \u201cBefore Applauding Hillary\u2019s Abortion Remarks, Know the One Fact She Ignored.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let these lies kill another child in such a horrific manner,\u201d she says, concluding the piece. The article was engaged with at least 1.1 million times, making it the most-shared article about abortion on Facebook last year, according to BuzzSumo, a company that tracks social sharing.Last week, the company\u2019s general counsel appeared before Congress alongside his counterparts from Twitter and Google to testify on the company\u2019s role in distributing misinformation ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Facebook says it\u2019s taking \u201cfake news\u201d seriously. It has a label for \u201cdisputed\u201d stories, brought in independent fact-checking partners and allows users to report false articles.It\u2019s not clear whether these attempts to tackle misinformation will work; critics have called them ineffective and slow. But there\u2019s another problem, too. So far, Facebook and the public have focused almost solely on politics and Russian interference in the United States election. What they haven\u2019t addressed is the vast amount of misinformation and unevidenced stories about reproductive rights, science and health.Evidence-based, credible articles about abortion from reputable news outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post didn\u2019t make it to the top of the list of \u201cmost shared\u201d articles on Facebook last year, according to BuzzSumo. But articles from the site LifeNews.com did.Facebook\u2019s current initiatives to crack down on fake news can, theoretically, be applicable to misinformation on other issues. However, there are several human and technical barriers that prevent misinformation about reproductive rights from being identified, checked and removed at the same \u2014 already slow \u2014 rate as other misleading stories.However, the incentive for the people who write content for anti-abortion news sites and Facebook pages is ideological, not financial. Anti-abortion, anti-science content isn\u2019t being written by spammers hoping to make money, but by ordinary people who are driven by religious or political beliefs. Their aim isn\u2019t to profit from ads. It\u2019s to convince readers of their viewpoint: that abortion is morally wrong, that autism is caused by vaccines or that climate change isn\u2019t real.Finally, public pressure influences where Facebook directs its attention. Facebook may be focused on fake news and the United States election now, but its efforts to prevent the spread of misinformation in the buildup to the election were practically nonexistent. It took action only after intense scrutiny.Now Facebook and its fact-checking partners say its focus is \u201con the worst of the worst, on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain.\u201d Simply put, without increased pressure, Facebook\u2019s technical efforts and its human efforts, like fact-checkers\u2019 trawling through flagged content, make it likely that the company, in the months to come, will be seeking out only the \u201cobvious\u201d flags of fake news stories and not the misinformation that is fueled by real people with no financial incentive. That is why those of us who are concerned by the misinformation around reproductive rights need to make ourselves heard.The Irish government says it will hold a referendum next year on whether to relax the country\u2019s strict ban on abortion. Some abortion-rights campaigners have expressed concern over the role of misinformation on social media platforms like Facebook in the lead-up to the vote, but it\u2019s far from clear whether those concerns are being listened to.Curbing the spread of fake news is no easy task, and Facebook says it cannot \u201cbecome arbiters of truth\u201d in the fight against fake news. But at the very least, the company can address its continuing role in inadvertently spreading false information about issues that go beyond the United States election and Russia.Rossalyn Warren (@rossalynwarren) is a journalist who regularly covers women\u2019s rights and internet culture.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Blind Runner\u2019s Wearable Technology Gets Off to Complicated Start", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Simon Wheatcroft walked onto the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to start the New York City Marathon, he could sense other runners moving around him but could see them only as one smudged shape.His vision had severely deteriorated by age 17 from a rare genetic disorder called retinitis pigmentosa. As a teenager, he developed night blindness. His peripheral vision eroded. For a while, he could still read and recognize faces. Now 35, he could detect little more than changes in light and darkness. Everything appeared as a snowy grayness.He was an experienced marathon runner, but each training session brought uncertainty. While training unassisted in the summer of 2016, Wheatcroft rammed into a burned-out car on his training path in Doncaster, England, three hours north of London. He needed stitches in his arm and wondered whether it was worth it to keep running.Even now, Wheatcroft remained torn. He had a wife and two young sons. A wrong step on a training run could lead to severe injury or worse. But he persevered. In a marathon, he felt the same as any other runner. And, as he chased the finish line, he also pursued technology that could help the blind and visually impaired lead more independent lives.\u201cI love a long shot,\u201d said Wheatcroft, a motivational speaker who is pursuing a master\u2019s degree in computer science. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to really push against the limits of possibility.\u201dAt the blast of a cannon, he set off on Sunday with more than 60 visually impaired marathoners to run New York for the third time. Some runners were tethered to their guides. Others ran as Wheatcroft had previously \u2014 shoulder to shoulder with their escorts, relying on touch and oral cues to remain safe. This time, however, he tried something bolder and riskier, attempting to navigate the course with only minimal assistance from three runners who shadowed him.He did so with the technology of so-called corrective navigation. Race officials said Wheatcroft appeared to be the first runner to use it in New York to negotiate the course\u2019s 26.2 miles, including five bridges, tricky turns, the rolling hills of Central Park and, most challenging, the jockeying of 50,000 other participants.If the race went according to plan, the friends who accompanied Wheatcroft would intervene only as a last resort to prevent him from colliding with another runner.\u201cWhat we really don\u2019t want to do is take someone else out of the race,\u201d he said.On his left arm, Wheatcroft wore a device that he helped develop with designers from a two-year-old Brooklyn company called WearWorks.The company\u2019s first product is a wristband \u2014 adapted as an armband for Wheatcroft \u2014 called a Wayband. It connects via Bluetooth with a smartphone and uses information from Google Maps, OpenStreetMap and proprietary technology to guide wearers to their destination by emitting patterns of vibrations instead of voice commands.Pulses from the armband were designed to keep Wheatcroft running on Sunday within a virtual corridor, about 20 feet wide, and to help him turn right and left. Four short, rapid vibrations signaled that a left turn was ahead. Two longer vibrations signaled a right turn.He also wore an ultrasonic sensor on his chest. Two sharp vibrations alerted him to runners crossing his path. No vibrations meant he was free of obstacles. Gentle pulses suggested he was securely cocooned in a pack of runners moving at roughly the same speed.Also attached to a strap on his chest was an iPhone. On his right arm was a separate GPS device to provide more accurate positioning on the course and to save battery life on the cellphone.Company officials and Wheatcroft, who has an equity share in WearWorks, say that tactile feedback is less intrusive and more intuitive than oral cues: Vibrations are not vulnerable to being drowned out by loud noises. The visually impaired are freed to use their sense of hearing to listen for approaching vehicles and pedestrians and to more fully engage in their surroundings.The Wayband technology is not unlike that used by cars to avoid collisions and to park safely, except the sensors employ vibrations instead of beeps.\u201cIt\u2019s 26 miles of reverse parking,\u201d Wheatcroft said with a laugh. \u201cThere might be a few dings in the bumper at the end. As long as there\u2019s only paint damage, we\u2019ll be O.K.\u201dEven for sighted runners in New York, the marathon course is a challenge beyond sheer mileage. It requires running in thick bunches and maneuvering carefully to the side of the road at water stations, where the pavement is wet and littered with paper cups.Wheatcroft was using new technology that had not been tested in a race. He understood that many things could go wrong. The metal girders of bridges along the course scrambled the digital compass on his iPhone. He worried about other possible navigational glitches caused by Bluetooth interference.What if someone stopped in front of him to take a selfie? How would he refill his water bottle? Could he remain on course as the race turned off Fifth Avenue and funneled into Central Park at Mile 24, curling around the reservoir, which had seemed to befuddle his GPS on some test runs?He had used technology, such as Runkeeper, an app that gave his pace and distance with voice commands. But corrective navigation for visually impaired runners was in its infancy. As Sunday\u2019s race approached, Wheatcroft described himself as excited, nervous, a little fearful.\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated course, there\u2019s a lot of people, you can\u2019t afford to make mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cReaction times need to be sharp.\u201dHis biggest concern, he said, was correctly interpreting the patterns of vibrations on his arm and chest. If he became confused, he planned to do what marathon runners often did in times of stress: slow down.Wheatcroft was a seasoned distance runner, having completed the Boston Marathon three times and ultramarathons as long as 83 miles. In 2014, he ran from Boston to New York as a warm-up, then ran the New York City Marathon. He hoped to finish in four and a half hours on Sunday, more than 40 minutes faster than his previous best in New York.Wheatcroft and Kevin Yoo, one of three founders of WearWorks, had been testing the Wayband technology since April. As with any prototypes, there were advances and setbacks. On Friday afternoon in Central Park, and again Saturday, last-minute refining continued with the chest sensor.Keith Kirkland, another founder of WearWorks, joked about running along the course during the race and calling out, \u201cAnyone have a soldering iron?\u201dOn Sunday, Yoo started his first marathon, hoping to accompany Wheatcroft for as long as he could. The Wayband device was turned off for the first two miles of the race on the ascent and descent of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Too many runners packed together. Too much risk of technological overload.\u201cCould we ask everyone to be considerate and please not use their cellphones?\u201d Yoo joked before the race.Crosswinds blowing over the chest sensor gave confusing signals to Wheatcroft on the bridge, but the roadway was wide and he had plenty of open space to run. Neil Bacon, a friend who has often accompanied Wheatcroft, reminded him not to get too exuberant.\u201cYou\u2019re doing 26 miles,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cDon\u2019t go off like it\u2019s a half-marathon.\u201dAt the first water stop, about two and a half miles into the race, a guide for another runner stopped in front of Wheatcroft. His chest sensor was set to alert him when an obstacle was seven feet away. He did not have enough time to stop and clipped the woman from behind, but neither was hurt. At the second water stop, he slowed and moved to the center of the road.Just after Mile 3, the Wayband device signaled incorrectly that Wheatcroft was headed in the wrong direction. He stopped and walked for a minute, then renewed his pace. Tall and thin, wearing a white cap on his shaved head, he had run four miles without any assistance.Taking in the aromatic scents of late-morning cooking in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, Wheatcroft said, \u201cI could run this thing on smell.\u201dBut he would have to be prepared if his digital compass went haywire later in the race \u2014 while on the Pulaski Bridge at the halfway point, the Queensboro Bridge between Miles 15 and 16 or the Willis Avenue Bridge at Mile 20 \u2014 and the vibrations from his armband signaled incorrectly that he was veering off course.\u201cSimon needs to trust himself and utilize his sense of hearing and just go straight,\u201d Yoo said.Wheatcroft argued that the New York City Marathon was the perfect place to test corrective navigation in an urban environment. It simulated the way people typically moved through cities, on the street, through crowds.Given that Wheatcroft was running with two guides who had accompanied him a number of times \u2014 Bacon and Andrea Croak, an American \u2014 he received the go-ahead from New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon. Achilles International, which places disabled runners in mainstream races, also approved.\u201cAnytime you can advance technology and bring it to life for people to be able to enhance themselves, it\u2019s all good,\u201d said Peter Ciaccia, the marathon\u2019s race director.Technology to assist visually impaired runners had advanced considerably since Marla Runyan of Santa Maria, Calif., the first legally blind athlete to compete in the Olympics, finished fourth at the 2002 New York City Marathon. In that race, a bicyclist was designated to call out her time at each mile and alert her to water stops and hazards on the course.Later, Runyan said, Nike made a prototype watch for her with a huge display in which each digit was an inch to an inch and a half tall. But the device did not prove reliable enough to wear in a race, she said.In April, Erich Manser of Littleton, Mass., ran the Boston Marathon using a service for the blind and visually impaired called Aira. Manser wore smart glasses, which streamed video of the course to a guide in Columbus, Ohio, who assisted him with short voice commands such as \u201crunner passing on the right,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re on the yellow line,\u201d \u201cclear path ahead\u201d and \u201ccups\u201d for the litter at water stops.Runyan, who coordinates athletes with disabilities for the Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the marathon there, said, \u201cI think we\u2019re in the early stages of what\u2019s going to eventually be possible,\u201d though she predicted that \u201cit\u2019s never going to be a one-size-fits-all solution.\u201dWheatcroft had begun running in 2010. Rock climbing proved an insurmountable task with severely limited sight. It was a difficult time in his life. Mobility was an issue. He seemed to be stuck too often indoors.\u201cRunning was a chance to get out there and do something,\u201d he said.His first path was a soccer field near his home in north-central England, where the footing was constant and dog-walkers sometimes grew impatient, wrongly assuming that he would see them and move out of the way.Eventually, Wheatcroft found a three-mile path near the Doncaster-Sheffield Airport that was largely devoid of foot traffic. By trial and error, he memorized the route, learning to avoid signs and posts. Sometimes he found himself crying at the effort and determination needed to keep running day after day.He was not prepared for the unseen car that had caught fire and been abandoned on his route in August 2016. He sliced his right arm. His wife urged him to quit running. What if he had broken his leg or severed an artery? He started to obsess that each time she dropped him off for training \u201cit would be the end.\u201dOne wrong step and he might be hit by a moving car.\u201cIt kept me up at night,\u201d Wheatcroft said.After a month or so, while delivering a speech in Bangalore, India, Wheatcroft joined a group on a run through the streets \u201cto see if I still had the daring to do it.\u201dAs a father of sons ages 7 and 4, he continues to have doubts about what he is doing. (\u201cIt starts to take its toll; it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d) But he is buoyed by the notion that technology that permits him to run could have broader implications in allowing the visually impaired to live their daily lives more freely.\u201cIf we move it forward by me perhaps being a little too risky, it\u2019s all for the greater good,\u201d Wheatcroft said.He laughed.\u201cSomeone needs to be the first person stupid enough to do it.\u201dFor about 13 to 15 miles on Sunday, Wheatcroft ran mostly unassisted. But things began to go wrong. The digital compass in his iPhone and the redundant one he wore on his arm malfunctioned. His pace slowed to 13 minutes per mile from just over 10 minutes. He struggled to navigate, had two additional collisions and sometimes was essentially shouldered around curves by other runners. At other times, he relied on lines on the road that he could feel with his feet.The extraordinary concentration required to guide himself \u201cbroke me,\u201d Wheatcroft said.At about Mile 16, the ultrasonic sensor also failed, apparently because of the rain. \u201cWe pretty much hit every issue we could potentially hit,\u201d Yoo, the WearWorks founder, said.For the final 10 miles, Wheatcroft ran as he had in previous marathons, with Bacon and Croak alongside, advising him of turns, potholes, curbs, water stops. He appeared exhausted when he crossed the finish line in 5 hours 17 minutes 40 seconds and put an arm around Bacon\u2019s shoulder for support.\u201cAwful,\u201d Wheatcroft said when asked how he felt.A few minutes later, though, he seemed somewhat consoled by the effort.\u201cToday was always about pushing the technology to its limit,\u201d Wheatcroft said. \u201cWe found the limit earlier in the race than we would have liked. But it was lessons learned. We can improve, move forward, make it better. It\u2019s not the end, it\u2019s just a start.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Our Love Affair With Digital Is Over", "Date": "2017-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionLike most relationships we plunge into with hearts aflutter, our love affair with digital technology promised us the world: more friends, money and democracy! Free music, news and same-day shipping of paper towels! A laugh a minute, and a constant party at our fingertips.Many of us bought into the fantasy that digital made everything better. We surrendered to this idea, and mistook our dependence for romance, until it was too late.Today, when my phone is on, I feel anxious and count down the hours to when I am able to turn it off and truly relax. The love affair I once enjoyed with digital technology is over \u2014 and I know I\u2019m not alone.Ten years after the iPhone first swept us off our feet, the growing mistrust of computers in both our personal lives and the greater society we live in is inescapable. This publishing season is flush with books raising alarms about digital technology\u2019s pernicious effects on our lives: what smartphones are doing to our children; how Facebook and Twitter are eroding our democratic institutions; and the economic effects of tech monopolies.So what now?As much as we might fantasize about it, we probably won\u2019t delete our social media accounts and toss our phones in the nearest body of water. What we can do is to restore some sense of balance over our relationship with digital technology, and the best way to do that is with analog: the ying to digital\u2019s yang.This surprising reversal of fortune for these apparently \u201cobsolete\u201d analog technologies is too often written off as nostalgia for a predigital time. But younger consumers who never owned a turntable and have few memories of life before the internet drive most of the current interest in analog, and often include those who work in Silicon Valley\u2019s most powerful companies.Analog, although more cumbersome and costly than its digital equivalents, provides a richness of experience that is unparalleled with anything delivered through a screen. People are buying books because a book engages nearly all of their senses, from the smell of the paper and glue to the sight of the cover design and weight of the pages read, the sound of those sheets turning, and even the subtle taste of the ink on your fingertips. A book can be bought and sold, given and received, and displayed on a shelf for anyone to see. It can start conversations and cultivate romances.The limits of analog, which were once seen as a disadvantage, are increasingly one of the benefits people are turning to as a counterweight to the easy manipulation of digital. Though a page of paper is limited by its physical size and the permanence of the ink that marks it, there is a powerful efficiency in that simplicity. The person holding the pen above that notebook page is free to write, doodle or scribble her idea however she wishes between those borders, without the restrictions or distractions imposed by software.In a world of endless email chains, group chats, pop-up messages or endlessly tweaked documents and images, the walled garden of analog saves both time and inspires creativity. Web designers at Google have been required to use pen and paper as a first step when brainstorming new projects for the past several years, because it leads to better ideas than those begun on a screen.In contrast with the virtual \u201ccommunities\u201d we have built online, analog actually contributes to the real places where we live. I have become friendly with Ian Cheung, the appropriately opinionated owner of June Records, up the street from my home in Toronto. I benefit not only from the tax revenues that June Records contributes as a local business (paving the roads, paying my daughter\u2019s teachers) but also from living nearby. Like the hardware store, Italian grocer and butcher on the same block, the brick and mortar presence of June adds to my neighborhood\u2019s sense of place (i.e., a place with a killer selection of Cannonball Adderley and local indie albums) and gives me a feeling of belonging. I also have no doubts that, unlike Twitter, Ian would immediately kick out any Nazi or raving misogynist who started ranting inside his store.Analog excels particularly well at encouraging human interaction, which is crucial to our physical and mental well-being. The dynamic of a teacher working in a classroom full of students has not only proven resilient, but has outperformed digital learning experiments time and again. Digital may be extremely efficient in transferring pure information, but learning happens best when we build upon the relationships between students, teachers and their peers.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s no room for us here anymore.\u201dThis week\u2019s exploration of the aftermath, both for Elliot and for Trenton and Mobley\u2019s families, brought the show\u2019s most explicit depiction of the Muslim experience in America. The episode, written by Mr. Esmail, was uncommonly tender and also a little odd (more on that later) as Elliot turned a corner \u2014 and perhaps began to synthesize his two halves \u2014 with the help of Trenton\u2019s little brother, Mohammed.We\u2019ve heard Trenton discuss him before. Her closeness with her family, along with the fact that she only joined fsociety because American capitalism had victimized her family, made hers the most tragic death we\u2019ve seen on \u201cMr. Robot.\u201d (For me, anyway.)The boy was perhaps a bit too much the precocious font of guileless wisdom, a favorite trope of filmmakers, and his surprise appearance and cutesy pestering of Elliot also verged on clich\u00e9. But he was also endearing. His remarks, in the mosque, about being the only person in his family who could be President pointed up the arbitrariness of one\u2019s place of birth \u2014 and all the judgments that are based on that \u2014 and reminded us that American citizenship can offer little protection for minority Americans. \u201cIf I were president, I would be able to stay here in the house we live in,\u201d he said.The growing bond between the lad and Elliot, and the experiences they shared, provided the emotional ballast for what was otherwise a curious hour full of pop culture references (\u201cBack to the Future II,\u201d \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d), odd characters (cosplayers, Hard Andy, Richard Masur\u2019s orthodox ice cream man) and magical coincidence (the returning Mr. Robot jacket), as Elliot took a fantastical voyage into despair and back.I imagine few viewers thought Elliot might actually delete himself with that bag of pills. The point was that the struggles with Mr. Robot, the guilt over the E Corp attacks and the deaths of Trenton and Mobley had blinded Elliot to the possibility of a future, before an unexpected human connection turned him toward hope.It was the most dramatic of several signs that despite its dark imaginings and increasingly frightened and militarized setting, \u201cMr. Robot\u201d still believes in the people\u2019s ability to turn things around.\u201cThings get a little fakakta for a while,\u201d the treats truck man noted. \u201cBut at the end, humans actually persevere.\u201dFor Elliot, that included beginning to repair his relationship with both the utterly undone Angela \u2014 \u201cNo matter what happens, we\u2019ll be O.K.\u201d \u2014 as well as perhaps Mr. Robot.We actually opened with what looked like the early days of his alter ego, a flashback that found a young Elliot coldly rejecting his dying father and claiming the signature jacket for himself. After ditching said jacket as part of his suicide preparation, it returned to Elliot just as he was receiving the email Trenton set up before her death, containing the reboot plan she first mentioned at the end of Season 2. The scheme would appear to call for a hack of N.Y.P.D. and/or the F.B.I., which could be just the thing to spur a more productive partnership between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\u2022 After carrying much of the early part of this season in emotionally intense fashion, Darlene has turned into someone who shows up at people\u2019s apartments, gives quick pep talks and then disappears.

{"Headline": "The Secret to Long Life? It May Lurk in the DNA of the Oldest Among Us", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut even as they indulged the notion that exceptionally healthy longevity can be explained by lifestyle, each agreed to donate DNA to a private effort to find the secrets in supercentenarian genes.The rare cache of supercentenarian genomes, the largest yet to be sequenced and made public, comes as studies of garden-variety longevity have yielded few solid clues to healthy aging. Lifestyle and luck, it seems, still factor heavily into why people live into their 90s and 100s.The New England Centenarian Study, one of a handful of longevity research groups around the world focusing on supercentenarians, now turns down prospective DNA donors under age 103: \u201cWe tell them they\u2019re too young,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Perls, the study\u2019s director.A professed citizen-scientist, Mr. Clement collected blood, skin or saliva from supercentenarians in 14 states and seven countries over a six-year period. Many were still gardening, arguing, driving and flirting. Ms. Michelson, for one, was fond of reading and reciting Shakespeare.Complex traits like height, body mass index and disease risk \u2014 phenotypes, as they are known in genetics-speak \u2014 typically arise from a combination of hundreds of places in the genome where the DNA alphabet differs between individuals.\u201cThis is what we call an \u2018extreme phenotype,\u2019 \u201d said Dr. Church, who ultimately arranged for the genomes to be sequenced so that Mr. Clement could release them through a nonprofit. \u201cThe farther out you go on the bell curve, the more likely you are to find something, even with a small sample size.\u201dAn account of what Mr. Clement calls the Supercentenarian Research Project offers a glimpse at what that might entail, including perseverance, compassion and a sense of humor that trends toward dark.It was an inauspicious start, Mr. Clement admitted in an email to a friend in January 2011. The first supercentenarian Mr. Clement had lined up to visit, Mississippi Winn, had died at 113 before he could get from his home in San Jose, Calif., to hers in Shreveport, La.Once that milestone is reached, as Mr. Clement quickly learned, the chance of dying within the next year is roughly 50 percent. After 113, the odds are closer to 66 percent. The oldest person on record, Jeanne Calment, was 122 when she died in 1997; only one other person is known to have lived beyond age 118.\u201cEven while you\u2019re packing the car, the person may fall ill and say they\u2019re not up to it,\u201d Mr. Clement said, after the first of several plans for me to observe a DNA donation was abruptly canceled.Mr. Clement could extract DNA from post-mortem samples, with permission from the family and assuming he could reach the funeral home in time. Exhumation is also possible, in theory, to obtain samples.But for understandable reasons, he said, family members most often ended communications with him at the time of a supercentenarian\u2019s death. To improve the odds of getting samples \u2014 and the gender balance, since supercentenarians are nearly all women \u2014 he lowered his target age from 110 to 106.\u201cIt\u2019s better to get there when they\u2019re alive,\u201d he said.He created Google alerts for the phrases \u201c109th birthday,\u201d \u201c110th birthday,\u201d and \u201c111th birthday,\u201d and for the obituaries of known supercentenarians.There was, nominally, the prospect of making money.But with a business plan that, even to some of his investors, sounded more like a research project, Mr. Clement seems to have undertaken the task largely because it provided the chance to act on a longstanding interest in human longevity, including his own.He harbors what he prefers to call a \u201chealthy love of life,\u201d rather than an aversion to death, and he is possessed of an apparently genuine conviction that longer lives would make humans more humane.\u201cMy hat was off to someone who was willing to take the time out of his life to go get these precious specimens,\u201d said Dr. Church, the Harvard geneticist, who has devoted a portion of his laboratory to research into the reversal of aging.The kind of ultrarare mutations that supercentenarians might harbor, Dr. Church believed, were not likely to be detected with standard techniques, which scan only the places in the genome where DNA is already known to vary between individuals.To look for as-yet-uncataloged variations would require sequencing all of the supercentenarians\u2019 six billion genetic letters, a far more expensive procedure. When he and Mr. Clement first discussed the idea in 2010, the cost was about $50,000 per genome.Mr. Sisnett, who grew his own food until he was 105, was \u201cstill fascinated by seeing a nice-looking backside\u201d when he was in his 110s, his daughter, Everine Carter, 88, recalled in a telephone interview.The best time to get DNA from a supercentenarian, Mr. Clement found, is midmorning. By lunchtime, they would prefer to be eating. After lunch, they might be groggy or napping.Most, like Dorothy Peel of London, then 108, had sharp minds. Ms. Peel inspected the informed consent form through her reading glasses and peppered him with questions about other supercentenarians he had met.Crisscrossing Europe in 2011, Mr. Clement hit his collecting stride. But there were some bumps.He had ordered an inexpensive kit that allowed him to prick a supercentenarian\u2019s finger and deposit a drop of blood on a card to preserve it, often used by geneticists in the field.Not until he had switched to hiring a phlebotomist to perform blood draws with a needle did he learn that the cards with the original 15 samples were defective. \u201cWe could not detect any DNA,\u201d read a 2011 email from the laboratory.Mr. Clement confessed the news to Dr. Church in a meeting at his Harvard office. \u201cYou didn\u2019t test the cards?\u201d the geneticist asked him gently.Still, Mr. Clement had 23 good samples in hand, and the cost of sequencing by this time had fallen to some $15,000 per genome. With his remaining funds, he sequenced 15, leaving the rest in cold storage.Mr. Clement quickly discovered 2,500 differences between the supercentenarian DNA and those of controls. But even with help from graduate students in Dr. Church\u2019s lab, it was hard with such a small group to know which, if any, were significant.So over the next few years, Mr. Clement, working without a salary, collected samples whenever he could, adding another dozen from supercentenarians across the United States.In July 2016, I was invited to accompany Mr. Clement to Mr. Matthews\u2019s home in California. As much as I looked forward to meeting my first supercentenarian, I was not prepared to envy his win in the genetic longevity lottery.The prospect of shifting today\u2019s average life span to that of the known limit of all humanity is disorienting. An average life expectancy of 80 in some ways seems generous \u2014 it was just 48 when Mr. Matthews was born in 1906. Most of us expect around 80 years on the planet, assuming nothing horrendous happens.\u201cWhen you have children the first time, it don\u2019t come with a manual, and it don\u2019t come with a manual when your dad gets to be 100, then 105, then 110,\u201d said Mr. Matthews\u2019s son, Steve, 75, who also gave blood the day we visited.But Mr. Matthews asserted without hesitation that he still enjoyed life. Pleasures included his lunchtime smoothie, his family, the kindness of his caregiver, and \u2014 this with a nod to a New York Times photographer and a rakish grin \u2014 \u201chaving my picture taken.\u201dHe reminisced fondly about his second wife, Katherine, who died in 1980 and with whom he had loved to dance.At 110, he said he had never been diagnosed with a serious illness. The younger Mr. Matthews recalled that his father had played a one-under-par, 18-hole golf game on his 99th birthday. Having built a successful real estate business, he provided financial support to his last surviving sibling, a sister who was 105.Talking to him, it was hard not to fantasize about the possibility that, as another Facebook participant suggested, \u201cby the time we get to that age, we may all be living to 110.\u201dAt the time the oldest man in America, Mr. Matthews sometimes strained to hear, but his sense of humor and perspective were intact. If that was what we wanted, he advised, \u201cKeep breathing.\u201dTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTWhether, in combination with the genomes of his fellow supercentenarians, the rest contains the secret to a long, healthy and happy life remains to be seen.An earlier version of this article misstated the Massachusetts town in which Goldie Michelson resided.

Motoko Rich, The Times\u2019s Tokyo bureau chief, discussed the tech she's using.  What kind of tech tools do you use to cover news in Japan? I also have a much smaller battery that I can use to juice up my phone when it starts to die from too much live tweeting, but the XXL comes in handy if I actually have to report and write a whole story away from the office or my home or a hotel room. In such a situation, I will use either a portable Wi-Fi or the personal hot spot on my cellphone to get online.Twitter is very popular in Japan, so if we want to get a sense of the mood about a particular breaking news story \u2014 much as we do in the United States \u2014 my researchers will scan Twitter or Facebook to get a sense of how people are reacting to news. Occasionally a tweet can be the seed of a feature story.Earthquake apps like QuakeFeed are also helpful in quake-prone Japan, not to mention as early indicators of nuclear tests in North Korea.Since I make a lot of calls to analysts and government officials in the United States either very early in the morning or late at night (Tokyo is 13 hours ahead of New York and Washington), I try to use WhatsApp or Skype to call people abroad since my Japanese cell plan charges extra for overseas calls. My small beef with the academics who specialize in Japan and the Korean Peninsula is that so many of them seem incapable or unwilling to use internet-based calling apps.What interesting tech trends do you see emerging in Japan that haven't yet reached the United States? For personal texting, Line, a communications app that started after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, is extremely popular. So I communicate with friends, my staff and even the woman who cuts my hair using Line. Part of the reason it's so popular here is its wide variety of emoticons and digital stickers.How do you use tech differently in Japan than you did in the United States? My 11-year-old son has a small \u201ckeitai,\u201d or kids\u2019 cellphone, that is programmed so he can only call or receive calls from me, my husband or his sister. By the time we left Brooklyn in 2016, it seemed like most kids his age either didn't have a phone at all, or had a smartphone. A lot of Japanese children, as young as age 6, have such keitais, which enable them to independently travel on subways and walk to and from school on their own while still being reachable. We often run into very small children on their own on the subway platform, the small phones dangling from their backpacks.Mobile payment systems have been slow to gain traction in America. How about in Japan? Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life? FaceTime, Skype and WhatsApp are lifelines for staying in touch with friends and family back home. My 13-year-old daughter regularly talks to her best friends in Brooklyn and in England on FaceTime, and the other day I Skyped into a meeting of my Brooklyn book group.I really only began posting regularly to Instagram once I moved to Japan, because I want everyone at home to be able to see what I\u2019m seeing every day, here and in South Korea, where I travel regularly to report. Japan and Korea are visually sumptuous places, and, yes, I am one of those clich\u00e9d people who post photos of their lunches.My daughter is obsessed with Snapchat and streaks, an activity whose point I have yet to grasp. But I have been surprised by the number of times she'll tell me that she has seen some news item on Instagram or Snapchat, an activity whose point I wholeheartedly endorse.The robotics industry is important to Japan. Meanwhile, personal digital assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are trendy in the United States. Where do you think this is all taking us?Unlike in the United States, where workers fear automation taking over their jobs, robotics are embraced here in Japan by the government, corporate sector and broader society. The government is anti-immigration, so one of its oft-cited solutions to a declining population and shrinking labor force is to rely increasingly on artificial intelligence.Whether robots can actually accomplish all the tasks they are being promoted for is an open question. I wonder whether something as personal as nursing home care can really be outsourced to robots. As a parent, I would hate the thought that robots would be used in day care facilities, unless it was just for food preparation or cleanup.Advertisement"}

But he said he has not, to the best of his recollection, had conversations with people inside the administration about the deal.To a question \u2014 posed by a CNN reporter in the crowd \u2014 about whether the pall over the deal can be attributed in part to a \u201cTrump factor,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said no.If completed, the acquisition of Time Warner \u2014 the owner of HBO, Warner Bros. and CNN \u2014 would transform AT&T into a colossus capable of both producing content and distributing it to millions of people via its wireless and satellite services.But on Wednesday, negotiations between the companies and the Justice Department appeared to be mired in politics.Accounts of AT&T\u2019s meeting with antitrust officials on Monday \u2014 which Mr. Stephenson said was \u201cvery productive\u201d \u2014 have differed. In one, Justice Department officials called on the company to sell Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN, or DirecTV \u2014 the satellite television provider that AT&T purchased two years ago for nearly $49 billion \u2014 for the Time Warner deal to proceed.Another version involved Mr. Stephenson\u2019s offering to sell the news channel.

There are no competitors being taken out of the competition. There hasn\u2019t been one of these challenged in the courts and defeated in 40 years.\u201dThe deal is designed to help AT&T counter slowing growth in its core wireless, internet and satellite businesses while fending off online video upstarts like Netflix and Hulu.\u201cThe idea that somehow we\u2019re going to take distribution and content and create something so powerful that it would disrupt Google, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix, it\u2019s comical to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying build a platform that allows us to compete with those guys.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Because the companies don\u2019t compete, their combining would not alter the competitive landscape in either the telecommunications or entertainment industries.For more than 40 years, through Republican and Democratic administrations, the courts have not blocked a vertical integration like this one.Typically more problematic for the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division are horizontal mergers, where two competitors in the same industry seek to combine. But this past summer the Trump administration waved through the horizontal merger of the giant retailer Amazon, already active in food sales, with a leading upscale grocer, Whole Foods. To now block a vertical integration of AT&T and Time Warner would indicate an inexcusably scattershot approach to antitrust decisions that would create enormous uncertainties for the broader business community and shake public confidence in the rule of law that underpins our democracy.Businesses seek to integrate vertically because such mergers tend to create efficiencies and synergies \u2014 benefiting both companies without posing major risks to their competitors or, more crucially, to consumers. With all the options available to consumers for receiving video programming these days \u2014 including cable, satellite, internet broadband and smartphones \u2014 the market is vibrantly, almost chaotically, competitive and innovative. When viewed in light of this creative turmoil, the AT&T-Time Warner transaction does not pose a competitive threat. If anything, it would create an attractive set of new options for the viewing public.To appreciate the dynamism of the video and television space, consider that Apple, a relatively new entrant, recently ordered two full seasons of Reese Witherspoon\u2019s latest television show without so much as seeing a pilot. It underscored the competitive new dynamics of the marketplace: Companies are throwing around cash like never before to attract viewers already happily distracted by an array of programming and viewing alternatives in this new golden age of television.Rather than Time Warner holding anything resembling a dominant position in the entertainment industry, it finds itself competing with emerging video powerhouses like Netflix and Amazon. And consumers are increasingly cutting the cable because they have numerous, often cheaper streaming options for getting content they want.How do we know? One need only look at perhaps the closest comparison to the AT&T-Time Warner merger \u2014 the marriage of the nation\u2019s largest cable and internet broadband provider, Comcast, to NBC Universal, which the Justice Department blessed in 2011. Despite the arguments of opponents at the time, there has been no negative impact to consumers or competitors. Quite the opposite \u2014 the competitive and creative forces that continue to change the industry have only accelerated since the Comcast-NBC merger.If the Justice Department cannot cite persuasive antitrust grounds for blocking the AT&T-Time Warner merger, the public will be left wondering whether political motives were involved or that the department\u2019s thinking was muddied by vague opposition to media consolidation. Neither of those reasons would likely stand up in federal court.By any objective analysis, the real power in the information industry these days is not in the wireless or entertainment industries. It is in companies like Google and Facebook, which possess the power to influence our national elections and redefine basic human interactions. In this brave new digital world, blocking the merger of AT&T and Time Warner would only undermine public confidence in the ability of antitrust enforcers to recognize reality.Instead, the Justice Department should approve the merger and get to work policing the real threats to competition and consumer welfare.Michael J.

{"Headline": "Soothsayer in the Hills Sees Silicon Valley\u2019s Sinister Side", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith ... Jaron LanierBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 Jaron Lanier is the most unusual person I\u2019ve ever met.And I\u2019ve met a lot of unusual people.\u201cI\u2019m a professional illusionist,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways, I might know more about making illusions than anybody.\u201dMr. Lanier is one of the few prophets who admits that the spawn of Silicon Valley could become evil, but he tries to stay on the sunny side. It helps that he avoids all social media.\u201cThe popular ones are designed for behavior modification,\u201d he says, wearing his usual black T-shirt and black pants. \u201cIt\u2019s like, why would you go sign up for an evil hypnotist who\u2019s explicitly saying that his whole purpose is to get you to do things that people have paid him to get you to do, but he won\u2019t tell you who they are?\u201dAt this moment when dark clouds loom over Silicon Valley, Mr. Lanier is able to talk about the Lords of the Cloud with affection yet candor, as he worries that these tech gods creating new worlds may be getting \u201chigh on their own supply.\u201d\u201cThis is such a scary time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says, in his sweet, breathy voice. \u201cI mean, it is for me. I had always feared we would create this social-manipulation technology out of computers.\u201dIn his forthcoming memoir, \u201cDawn of the New Everything: Encounters With Reality and Virtual Reality,\u201d the Microsoft wizard enthuses that VR \u201cweds the nerdy thing with the hippie mystic thing,\u201d high-tech but like a dream and \u201can elixir of unbounded experience.\u201dBut he\u2019s well aware of the \u201cMatrix\u201d dangers. He realized early on, he writes, that \u201cit could turn out to be the evilest invention of all time.\u201dIt\u2019s a pretty simple proposition, he tells me: \u201cIf you control the person\u2019s reality, you control the person.\u201d Or as he writes in the book, \u201cNever has a medium been so potent for beauty and so vulnerable to creepiness.\u201dRecently, the creepiness has been on display.Mark Zuckerberg stumbled into more trouble for tone-deafness when he used his cartoon avatar to take a disaster adventure trip, a \u201cmagical\u201d 360-degree virtual reality tour of hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico to promote his new Facebook Spaces app.\u201cOh, God,\u201d Mr. Lanier said when he saw it. \u201cIt is scary and awful how out of touch Silicon Valley people have become.\u201dThe story also noted that, given how lifelike the technology is, \u201ccertainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual reality sex constitutes cheating.\u201dMr. Lanier, who discourses eloquently on subjects like limerence and lust in his book, says: \u201cThe future I\u2019d prefer to see is one where people use VR together to make really crazy imaginative experiences that might be sexual or might not. Where you turn into fantastical creatures and that sort of thing. Or when your bodies merge in some ways. That to me is so much more interesting than the porn. Porn is a product of the cinema era. It\u2019s an old-fashioned way of thinking, locked in the 19th century.\u201dMore and more, we are wondering why, when we know the top Silicon Valley companies are not benevolent, we invite them into the most intimate areas of our lives, as Scott Galloway asks in \u201cThe Four,\u201d a book about how Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are refashioning the world. \u201cAre these entities the Four Horsemen of god, love, sex, and consumption?\u201d Mr. Galloway wonders. \u201cOr are they the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse?\u201dEven though he\u2019s prone to whimsical, esoteric tangents, I know I can get a straight answer on that from Mr. Lanier.We sit down at his dining room table amid a wild cornucopia of stuff, including a lamp with a hot pink feathered shade and black cats lounging on chairs and hanging, Cirque du Soleil-style, from carpeted staircases. There are also musical instruments \u2014 a golden Wurlitzer pedal harp; a rare pre-Depression Mason & Hamlin piano that Mr. Lanier says has \u201ca uniquely American sound,\u201d a 19th-century Chinese opium bed filled with saxophones, flutes, clarinets, lutes and ouds; mandolins covering the walls, and over a thousand more instruments, from a medieval cornetto to a shakuhachi, a Japanese flute \u2014 all of which Mr. Lanier can play.Like his house, his new book is crammed full of strange and mesmerizing stuff.Right after he was born, his mother, a Marlene Dietrich look-alike and Viennese pianist and stock trader who had talked her way out of a concentration camp by passing as Aryan, and his father, whose family had been mostly wiped out in Ukrainian pogroms, took Jaron someplace they thought would be safe: the westernmost corner of Texas. There, he had to confront more than his share of bullies growing up, once by swinging a baritone horn at them.His mother died when he was about 9, when her car flipped over on the freeway as she was coming back from getting her driver\u2019s license. His father, who worked for a time as the science editor of \u201cAmazing,\u201d \u201cFantastic\u201d and \u201cAstounding\u201d pulp science-fiction magazines, then let his 11-year-old son design their new house in New Mexico: a geodesic dome.The design, Mr. Lanier writes, looked \u201ca little like a woman\u2019s body. You could see the big dome as a pregnant belly and the two icosahedrons as breasts.\u201dHe tosses out that his father may have been the one to start the rumor about alligators in the sewers of New York.After a takeout chicken and macaroni dinner, Mr. Lanier bids a loving good night to his wife, Lena, a child psychologist, and their 11-year old daughter, Lilibell. Then he brings out his Microsoft HoloLens headsets and a big mug of chocolate milk. \u201cI\u2019m more like the child than the parent, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he says.I spend some time wearing the headset painting graffiti in the air with my hand, and Mr. Lanier explains why the brain can see more than the eyes.\u201cExpect some smelly feet,\u201d Mr. Lanier says.Unlike many here, he does not think of humans as ants in his experiments.\u201cHopefully, in this period, when we\u2019re dealing with this really crude and early stuff like Facebook feeds, Instagram, Snapchat,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019ll be able to get the politics straight and find a path for people to have dignity and autonomy before the hard-core stuff comes. Unless we all kill ourselves through this other stuff, which is a possibility, too. One of the great joys of the Trump era is having your 11-year-old say, \u2018The former head of NATO said there\u2019s a one in 10 chance of nuclear war. Is that right?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, great. Thank you, Trump. That\u2019s very nice.\u2019\u201dMr. Lanier believes that Facebook and Google, with their \u201ctop-down control schemes,\u201d should be called \u201cBehavior Modification Empires.\u201d\u201cThe whole internet thing was supposed to create the world\u2019s best information resource in all of history,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything would be made visible. And instead we\u2019re living in this time of total opacity where you don\u2019t know why you see the news you see. You don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same news that someone else sees. You don\u2019t know who made it be that way. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s paid to change what you see. Everything is totally obscure in a profound way that it never was before.\u201cAnd the belief system of Silicon Valley is so thick that my friends at Facebook simply still really believe that the answer to any problem is to do more of what they already did, that they\u2019re optimizing the world.\u201cThe Facebook business model is mass behavior modification for pay. And for those who are not giving Facebook money, the only \u2014 and I want to emphasize, the only, underlined and in bold and italics \u2014 reward they can get or positive feedback is just getting attention. And if you have a system where the only possible prize is getting more attention, then you call that system Christmas for Asses, right? It\u2019s a creep-amplification device.\u201cOnce Facebook becomes ubiquitous, it\u2019s a sort of giant protection racket, where, if you don\u2019t pay them money, then someone else will pay to modify the behavior to your disadvantage, so everyone has to pay money just to stay at equilibrium where they would have been otherwise,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s only one way out for Facebook, which is to change its business model. Unless Facebook changes, we\u2019ll just have to trust Facebook for any future election result. Because they do apparently have the ability to change them. Or at least change the close ones.\u201dWhy would Facebook change its business model when it\u2019s raking in billions?\u201cI would appeal to the decency of the people in it,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd if not to them, then the toughness of the regulators. It\u2019s going to be one of the struggles of the century.\u201dI point out that after the stunning Trump win, President Obama took Mr. Zuckerberg aside and warned him to take the threat of political disinformation seriously, but the young billionaire dismissed the idea that it was widespread.\u201cWell, no one in Silicon Valley believes that anybody knows more than us,\u201d Mr. Lanier says dryly. \u201cSurely not the government.\u201dHe continues: \u201cI think there are a lot of good people at Facebook, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re evil as individuals. Or at least not the ones that I\u2019ve met. And I know Google a lot better, and I feel pretty certain that they\u2019re not evil. But both of these companies have this behavior-manipulation business plan, which is just not something the world can sustain at that scale. It just makes everything crazy.\u201dI remark that Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg expressed surprise that their fiendish little invention could do something so nefarious.\u201cPeople in the community knew,\u201d Mr. Lanier says, adding that he wrote essays and participated in debates in the early 1990s about how easy it would be the create unreality and manipulate society, how you could put out a feed of information that would put people in illusory worlds where they thought they had sought out the information but actually they had been guided \u201cthe way a magician forces a card.\u201d\u201cSo for somebody to say they didn\u2019t know the algorithms could do that,\u201d Mr. Lanier says in a disbelieving tone. \u201cIf somebody didn\u2019t know, they should\u2019ve known.\u201dSo what happens when fake news marries virtual reality?\u201cIt could be much more significant,\u201d Mr. Lanier says. \u201cWhen you look at all the ways of manipulating people that you can do with just a crude thing like a Facebook feed \u2014 when people are just looking at images and text on their phones and they\u2019re not really inside synthetic worlds yet \u2014 when you can do it with virtual reality, it\u2019s like total control of the person. So what I\u2019m hoping is that we\u2019re going to figure this stuff out so we don\u2019t make ourselves insane before virtual reality becomes mature.\u201dHe says that Silicon Valley has turned out both better and worse than he expected: \u201cAs far as the worse part, creating a global behavior-modification empire is worse than I thought. And creating a world that\u2019s more opaque instead of less opaque is worse than I thought we should do. It\u2019s also a physically uglier place than I thought it would be. It\u2019s really a shame. If we\u2019re the new Renaissance, why don\u2019t we make this amazing Tuscany here? We have these gorgeous orchards. Why don\u2019t we do something beautiful here instead of just filling it up with parking lots and horrible buildings?\u201dHe says sometimes his peers in the Valley seem perfectly nice but then they will say something \u201cI just can\u2019t believe.\u201d He cites Eric Schmidt\u2019s comment on privacy on CNBC\u2019s \u201cInside the Mind of Google\u201d special in 2009, that \u201cIf you have something that you don\u2019t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Mr. Lanier asks. \u201cIt does give me this feeling sometimes that something\u2019s going wrong with our culture in Silicon Valley and maybe it\u2019s just that thing of power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely, just losing perspective. Like Zuckerberg might think, \u2018Well, I went around to a bunch of states and I ate barbecue and wrestled cattle so I\u2019ve been around all kinds of people.\u2019 But to have people who you respect and listen to have fundamentally different worldviews and question your core logic and think that you may be way off track, that\u2019s a much harder thing to do. And there are people who can be very powerful and comfortable with that. I\u2019ll mention one, whose name is Barack Obama.\u201dI ask Mr. Lanier about the sexual harassment and gender inequity problems roiling the Valley.\u201cWell, sometimes, I think there\u2019s a kind of emerging new male jerk persona of the digital age, which would be some kind of a cross between the Uber guy and the pharma bro and maybe Milo Yiannopoulos and maybe Palmer Luckey and maybe Steve Bannon,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause, there\u2019s this sort of smug, superior, \u2018I\u2019ve got the levers of power, and I know better than you.\u2019 It\u2019s sort of this weird combination of a lot of power and a lot of insecurity at the same time.\u201d He believes that Gamergate led to the alt right. \u201cIt was one of the feeders,\u201d he says.He talks about another personality that is emerging from the digital age.\u201cIf you\u2019re a mark of social media, if you\u2019re being manipulated by it, one of the ways to tell is if there\u2019s a certain kind of personality quality that overtakes you,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been called the snowflake quality. People criticize liberal college kids who have it, but it\u2019s exactly the same thing you see in Trump. It\u2019s this kind of highly reactive, thin-skinned, outraged single-mindedness. I think one way to think of Trump, even though he is a con man and he is an actor and he\u2019s a master manipulator and all that, in a sense he\u2019s also a victim. I\u2019ve met him a few times over 30 years. And what I think I see is someone who has moved from kind of a New York character who was in on his own joke to somebody who is completely freaked out and outraged and feeling like he is on the verge of a catastrophe every second. And so my theory about that is that he was ruined by social media.\u201dMr. Lanier plays me a song he composed to cheer up his wife when she was going through cancer treatments, a Cuban-style charanga flute solo played on a Japanese shakuhachi \u2014 \u201cwhich is a crazy-hard thing to do and I pulled it off.\u201dThen he confides his fear that one of his older cats, Loof, would have been a Trump supporter.\u201cLoof is the sweetest cat in the world but she\u2019s really an anti-immigrant voter,\u201d he says. \u201cShe did not like the idea of young cats coming here. She really didn\u2019t want the change. She really felt like they ruined everything. And I must point out that the new kittens who came are black kittens. They appear to be Bombay cats. Loof is not in a basket of deplorables. She\u2019s just in a basket of blankets.\u201dAs I get ready to leave, the grand illusionist offers an intriguing theory about why the internet is more obsessed with cats than dogs.\u201cI think we know that Facebook is turning us into trained dogs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know we\u2019re being trained. We can feel ourselves being turned into trained circus animals. And we long for that independence that cats show. So when you look at a cat video, what you\u2019re really seeing is this receding identity that you want to cling to and find again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Doyenne of DNA Says: Just Chillax With Your Ex", "Date": "2017-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith...Anne WojcickiMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 In 2007, Anne Wojcicki, then 33, lassoed the moon.She was getting her new company, 23andMe, a mail-order genetics testing firm, off the ground with her \u201cParty \u2019til you spit\u201d celebrity get-togethers.Soon after the marriage, as Mr. Brin accumulated more power, a yacht, and a fleet of jets, Ms. Wojcicki became pregnant with the first of their two children and Google invested millions in her start-up, named after the 23 paired chromosomes that consist of our DNA.But six years later, the Silicon Valley fairy tale was shattered by two public humiliations: Mr. Brin got involved with a beautiful young Englishwoman named Amanda Rosenberg, who provided a public face for Google Glass \u2014 an attachment that broke up his marriage. And the Food and Drug Administration shut down the primary function of Ms. Wojcicki\u2019s business, calling her D.N.A. spit vial \u201can unapproved medical device\u201d and imposing stricter rules for consumer genetic testing. Her business, once so ripe with promise to tackle health issues, was curtailed to its ancestry testing division.And here is where genetics saved the genetics entrepreneur. Her father, Stanley, fled Poland in 1949 when he was 12 with his mother when the Communists took over. Her mother, Esther, was the daughter of impoverished Orthodox Russian Jews who immigrated to New York in the \u201920s.The Wojcickis grew into Silicon Valley royalty. It\u2019s the sort of family, Anne jokes, where \u201cyou\u2019re only a viable fetus once you have your Ph.D.\u201d Stanley is the former chairman of the Stanford physics department and an emeritus professor. Esther, whose family just wanted her to marry a nice Jewish man and have children, became valedictorian of her high school and got a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley. She is a journalism teacher so beloved at Palo Alto High School that her former student James Franco made a video paean to her.Besides Anne, there are two older daughters, Susan, who was Google employee No. 18 and is now the C.E.O. of YouTube, and Janet, an epidemiologist, medical anthropologist, associate professor at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and a Fulbright scholar.\u201cMy mom is utterly the believer, like she can get anything done,\u201d says Anne Wojcicki, also known as Baby Woj, now 44. \u201cShe had a real fighter mentality growing up, and I feel that was how we were raised. We\u2019re all super-comfortable in controversy. My mom\u2019s like, \u2018Listen, a lot of really bad stuff happened in my life. You either let that control you or you make the rest of your life great.\u2019 Her little brother died when she was little. You don\u2019t let a bad experience hold you back, otherwise you spend the rest of your life ruined by that experience. So it doesn\u2019t matter what happened today. Make it better tomorrow.\u201dMs. Wojcicki used that philosophy to claw her way out of her dark hole.\u201cIt was a bad year,\u201d she says, sitting in her small glass office in her \u201cuniform\u201d of Lululemon shorts and shirt and \u201ccompany-issued\u201d jacket. She laughs ruefully. \u201cI\u2019m pretty optimistic. But we\u2019d occasionally sit around and be like, \u2018Wow, it\u2019s really, it\u2019s been really bad.\u2019 Some of my friends and I bought these baseball hats that have these little unicorns attached to them. That was kind of our \u2018We\u2019re going to wear these hats and just kind of believe in the potential of what can come.\u2019\u201d Funnily enough, she grasped at the magical creature as a symbol of hope before it caught on as a popular Silicon Valley term for a billion-dollar start-up, which 23AndMe became in 2015.\u201cIn some ways, when you have that many bad things happen, it\u2019s a sense of disbelief,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was one of those situations where there\u2019s two aspects. A divorce and the F.D.A. There was no workaround in either. So it was one of the first times in my life where you have to accept, you have to actually change. Like, I need to come up with a different way of approaching both of these relationships.\u201dMr. Brin is fortunate that Ms. Wojcicki is not the vengeful type. Once they learned, from his spit test, that he has a rare genetic mutation that increases the risk for Parkinson\u2019s disease, she bought the patent on a gene variant that could protect people who have that Parkinson\u2019s-related mutation.Ms. Wojcicki says that after the separation, she felt like she had entered another dimension, comparing it to stepping through Harry Potter\u2019s Platform 9\u00be. \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy world and you never knew it existed until you enter it,\u201d she says. She tried reading a book about divorce but stopped when she got to a story of a divorced man whose ex-wife came over and chopped up his new girlfriend\u2019s underwear.\u201cI was like, \u2018I never want to be one of those people,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI never want to be angry. For me, it\u2019s a lot of work. I can be angry for 24 hours and then I\u2019m just like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s just be friends.\u2019\u201dIt is a sentiment echoed by her mother.\u201cMy theory is that you\u2019re only hurting yourself when you\u2019re angry and revengeful,\u201d Esther Wojcicki says. \u201cI was mad at Sergey for what he did. But I don\u2019t carry grudges. He\u2019s the father of my grandchildren. He was not such a good dad when the kids were babies. But he\u2019s a very good dad now. He made his own life difficult, unfortunately. I can still be civil to him. Why not? What\u2019s in it for me being nasty?\u201dAnne Wojcicki, who saw so much \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d behavior and had so many \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it after the lap dance\u201d conversations when she was a Wall Street biotech analyst for a decade that she thought she might never want to get married, still speaks fondly of her oddball courtship with Mr. Brin. He would leave her voice mail messages in Morse code or notes about where to meet him in Braille.\u201cAnd I\u2019d be like, \u2018Ugh, can\u2019t you just tell me where to go?\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut it was fun. I feel like you need to balance each other in relationships. Somebody can be totally insane, and then somebody has to buy food and pay rent.\u201dShe says their swimsuit wedding \u201cwas fun because I\u2019m not a hair-and-makeup person. And so I was like, \u2018Look, there\u2019s no hair and makeup because I\u2019m swimming.\u2019\u201dShe lights up when she reminisces about \u201cthe beauty and fun of hanging out\u201d with \u201cthe little team\u201d of Mr. Brin and his Google co-founder, Larry Page.\u201cThey genuinely see the world in a different way, and that\u2019s what\u2019s fun,\u201d she says. \u201cLike, the sky is not blue. It\u2019s some other shade.\u201dAs an example, she describes the time she and Mr. Brin had to take their children to the passport office. After 10 minutes in line, Mr. Brin was able to give the teller a redesign for the office for better traffic flow.Ms. Wojcicki has a big house near Mr. Brin\u2019s big house in Los Altos \u2014 where she also owns a children\u2019s cafe and an arcade \u2014 and they see a lot of each other. \u201cFor me, it doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re married or not,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have children.\u201dLike others in Silicon Valley obsessed with living forever, she takes the long view: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to live to 150 years, the reality that you\u2019re going to be with one person for 100 years is low. And so you have to find a way that we can have relationships with people and preserve what\u2019s positive.\u201dShe says she wants to be a model for how to deal with controversy and disappointment to her son and daughter.\u201cI get really sad when I meet people who have conflict in their family,\u201d she says. \u201cLike people who hate their parents or don\u2019t like a sibling or have an acrimonious divorce. Life is just too short.\u201dOne of the friends who helped her through that period was Ivanka Trump, though their relationship has grown more complicated.\u201cShe was super-supportive when I got divorced and had all kinds of issues,\u201d says Ms. Wojcicki, who was a big Hillary Clinton booster. \u201cDo I agree with all the things that are happening politically? No. But as a person, the way she treated me, I have a lot of respect for that. And I consider her a friend.\u201dTwo years ago, through friends, Ms. Wojcicki met a strapping man who represented every woman\u2019s dream of how you one-up an ex, especially a Silicon Valley nerd.\u201cDo you know anything about baseball?\u201d Ms. Wojcicki asked her friend Michael Specter, a New Yorker staff writer.\u201cI know how many innings there are, which is more than you know,\u201d he replied.\u201cI think I\u2019m starting to date a baseball player,\u201d she said. Mr. Specter assumed she meant a lawyer who played baseball on the weekends.\u201cHis name is Alex Rodriguez,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he plays for the Yankees.\u201dMr. Specter explained to the woman who had never attended a professional baseball game that her new suitor was one of the 10 best baseball players who ever lived.\u201cWhen I started dating Alex,\u201d Ms. Wojcicki says, \u201cmy mom was like, \u2018What\u2019s an A-Rod?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Mom, that\u2019s his name.\u2019\u201dBeing a math wiz, Ms. Wojcicki proceeded to learn every stat. When Mr. Rodriguez saw her watching a YouTube show called \u201cPhysics Girl\u201d and asked her what it was, she told him, \u201cIt\u2019s like the YES Network but for physics.\u201dThe two enjoyed their cultural-collision romance, once Ms. Wojcicki installed TV sets in her house so A-Rod could watch baseball.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that you need special channels to watch sports games,\u201d she says. \u201cAlex is a really sweet guy. He\u2019s a smart guy. He\u2019s a good person. Alex lives in this world of cash-flow businesses, and Silicon Valley lives in this world of the potential of the future. So it was actually kind of a really fun conversation. Alex was really into car dealerships, and I was like, \u2018We\u2019re all about self-driving cars. Nobody\u2019s going to buy a car. You want to buy a car dealership? I\u2019m going to short your car dealership.\u2019\u201dAt the Met Ball in 2016, in a move described by Vanity Fair as \u201chead-spinningly civilized,\u201d the couple arrived in the same car as Mr. Brin and the woman he is now living with, Nicole Shanahan, the founder and C.E.O. of ClearAccessIP.Ms. Wojcicki was carrying a specially designed clutch made from gene chips, the same ones her company runs DNA saliva samples on.Eventually different coasts and parenting obligations pulled her and Mr. Rodriguez apart.\u201cI liked A-Rod, he was a very nice man,\u201d Esther Wojcicki told me. \u201cHe came from a Hispanic family. We liked them, they were very sweet. He seemed to be genuinely in love with Anne. But I right away figured out this was a mismatch. He had no academic background. We couldn\u2019t have an intellectual conversation about anything. His main interest in life was something that none of us had ever focused on, which was baseball. He could park himself in front of a TV and watch baseball for 10 hours a day. He wasn\u2019t even sure he wanted to go on the yacht with Anne because the TV might not be working. I wish J-Lo all the luck in the world.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t go anywhere with him. If we went to Target to look for clothes for the kids, all of a sudden we\u2019d be looking around and people would be saying, \u2018We just want a selfie with A-Rod.\u2019 He can\u2019t walk across Central Park. He has to take a cab. That will work better with J-Lo because she\u2019s like, \u2018Take a picture of me anytime.\u2019\u201d (The evidence can be seen on the current cover of Vanity Fair, in which an entwined J-Rod gaze longingly into Mario Testino\u2019s lens, and in an inside spread with him pulling up her dress to reveal a crystal-encrusted Tom Ford thong.)Mr. Specter teases Ms. Wojcicki: \u201cYou\u2019ll be the answer to an S.A.T. question: \u2018Which woman who dated Alex Rodriguez is not like the others? Kate Hudson, Madonna, J-Lo or Anne Wojcicki.\u2019\u201dMs. Wojcicki admits that next time, \u201cI\u2019d really love to date someone who\u2019s really simple and not famous. My life is already pretty complicated.\u201dHer mother raised the Wojcicki girls to be skeptical of anything too flashy or polished and to remember that it\u2019s just as easy to wear a jacket in the house as it is to turn up the heat.Even now that she owns a billion-dollar company, Ms. Wojcicki remains frugal and says repeatedly that she does not like \u201cfroufrou things.\u201d\u201cFancy cars and houses and the right dress,\u201d she says dismissively. \u201cIt\u2019s not a top priority. This is why I\u2019m lucky to have Susan.\u201dOf her sister, she says, \u201cSusan went to the Oscars with me last year and literally at 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon \u2014 you\u2019re supposed to be ready at 5 \u2014 she\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m in Macy\u2019s. I found a dress on sale.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Susan, you kill me.\u2019\u201dShe still rides her bike to work every day \u2014 even in the rain \u2014 shops at Payless shoes (but also sometimes indulges in Louboutin) and cuts her children\u2019s hair herself.\u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of a disagreement between me and Sergey,\u201d she says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think I do a very good job. And my poor son is very sweet, so he\u2019ll be like, \u2018No, Mommy, I love it.\u2019\u201dShe makes an effort to keep her children\u2019s lives from slipping into the \u201cinsanity\u201d of megawealth.\u201cI have people who clean the house three days a week,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just told them to stop doing laundry on Fridays because my kids need to learn how to do laundry on Fridays. It\u2019s so easy to be like, \u2018I don\u2019t have to do laundry again. I don\u2019t have to cook again.\u2019 But then you\u2019re not normal. I have a new rule lately. I just don\u2019t go out on weekdays. If I\u2019m raising kids, I need to be focused on helping implement that normalcy.\u201dSometimes she lets them wear their clothes to bed because it saves time in the morning. \u201cThe other thing I used to do, when we\u2019d travel in the summers, because I don\u2019t like to pack a lot,\u201d she says, \u201cand so I\u2019d have the kids bathe in their clothes and then they change into something else. And then their clothes are clean for the next day. Versus the hotel laundry, which is so expensive.\u201dShe\u2019s focused for now on her children, her new Bengal cats and her company, which has more than three million customers and its own drug-development program. It started selling kits in CVS and Target, got the F.D.A.\u2019s permission to resume giving consumers health reports on 10 conditions, including Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s, and the $99 ancestry kit won a spot as one of \u201cOprah\u2019s favorite things\u201d this year, with Oprah calling it \u201cThe Ultimate Selfie.\u201d Fast Company portrayed Ms. Wojcicki as the Comeback Kid of tech.She realized that she had a treasure trove of DNA data and began teaming with Genentech and Procter & Gamble, which started mining it to make breakthroughs in Parkinson\u2019s, depression and skin care.In many ways, her struggle with the F.D.A. was a microcosm of the increasingly tense battle between hidebound regulatory agencies and freewheeling tech companies.Although some people thought Ms. Wojcicki would have to sell her company, she healed the breach with the F.D.A. the same way she healed the breach with Mr. Brin. She did not huff away and seethe and backbite. She \u201cput one foot ahead of the other,\u201d as her mother advises, hired the best regulatory experts and found a respectful new configuration for the relationship.\u201cWe were not communicating in the right way,\u201d she says of the period the F.D.A. felt it was being ignored. \u201cWe were not showing Silicon Valley arrogance. We just were running around with our shoes on in a Japanese house. We were not a cultural fit and we weren\u2019t expressing what we were trying to do in the right way.\u201cSome companies are trying to circumvent the regulators. We weren\u2019t. We just got caught in the cross hairs. We clearly pissed them off. It took us a long time to generate a lot of data to prove that our intentions actually were right. But I feel like we\u2019re doing the right thing in terms of proving that the customer is capable of getting this information on their own.\u201cI see it from the F.D.A. perspective. It\u2019s a new product. It\u2019s genetics. It\u2019s direct to consumer. It caused anxiety. So, you know, the onus was on us.\u201dShe had to explain to her team: \u201cListen, when you go to the D.M.V., you don\u2019t argue about the vision test. You don\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, I just had a vision test. I don\u2019t need to do the vision test.\u2019 Like, you just do it. The F.D.A. is in charge of public safety, and I have a respect for the job that they have to do. And we\u2019re just going to do the job that they\u2019re asking us to do.\u201dI ask her if Harvey Weinstein, an early investor, is still involved.\u201cOnce an investor, always an investor. It\u2019s like \u2018Hotel California,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cHe has always been supportive of the company and of me, but he clearly has behavior that you can\u2019t possibly condone. You recognize that people can have two different worlds. So it\u2019s disappointing.\u201dShe said that her best mentors have been Arianna Huffington and Diane von Furstenberg. \u201cThey are the two people who are just like, \u2018I want to support women. I want to support you doing awesome things. I believe in you. You can do it.\u2019\u201dI tell her that I am too scared to take her spit test. I don\u2019t want to know if my father wasn\u2019t my father, or if I\u2019m German and not Irish, or if the future holds some hideous disease.\u201cGenetics is like your cholesterol test,\u201d she says. \u201cSo your cholesterol test is going to tell you if you have high cholesterol, which is a risk factor for heart disease. But it\u2019s not saying you\u2019re going to die immediately from heart disease or even die at all from heart disease. It\u2019s just saying you have a risk factor. And so genetics is similar. It\u2019s saying you have a risk factor. So the beauty to me of genetics is, it\u2019s always a story of hope.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Wildest Place Is Open for Business", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "Advertisement\nSeveral years ago a mapping expert pinpointed the most remote place in the Lower 48 states. The spot was in the southeast corner of Yellowstone National Park, 20 miles from the nearest road. Roman Dial read the news and wasn\u2019t much impressed. To him, 20 miles \u2014 the distance a hungry man could walk in a long day \u2014 didn\u2019t seem very remote at all.Judged by miles, Mr. Dial reckoned, the place was six times more isolated than that corner in Yellowstone. So he decided to walk there. On the journey he and his companion didn\u2019t see anyone else for 24 days.Their destination lay within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. NPR-A, as it is known, is the single largest parcel of public land in the United States. The reserve sprawls across nearly 23 million acres, which makes it larger than Maine or South Carolina or 10 other states. The reserve\u2019s eastern border sits about 100 miles to the west of the more famous Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Separating the two like a thorn between roses lies the industrial sprawl of Prudhoe Bay.Beaufort SeaNationalpetroleumreserveBeringStraitarcticnationalwildliferefugeALASKAANCHORAGEBETHELJUNEAUGulf ofAlaskaBeaufort SeaNationalpetroleumreservearcticnationalwildliferefugeBeringStraitALASKANomeANCHORAGEBETHELJUNEAUGulf ofAlaskaBeaufort SeaNationalpetroleumreservearcticnationalwildliferefugeBeringStraitALASKANomeANCHORAGEBETHELJUNEAUGulf ofAlaskaIf the reserve still doesn\u2019t ring a bell, you\u2019re not alone. Even Google Earth doesn\u2019t know it, though the reserve is 10 times the size of Yellowstone. \u201cIt is the wildest place in America that you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d as one conservationist recently told me.\u201cOur goal is an America that is the strongest energy superpower that this world has ever known,\u201d he told the group, and added, \u201cthe road to energy dominance goes through the great state of Alaska.\u201dAll of this comes as several recent finds on state and federal lands and in the waters of the far north, including potentially the largest oil discoveries in the state in at least two decades, have spurred a surge of interest there. Alaskan Republicans are cheering these efforts, desperate for rescue from a recession caused by the cratering of oil prices. The pressure to drill the top of the world is high.Though he is chief steward of our public heritage, Mr. Zinke has proved himself more wedded to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d than to educating himself about the public lands he oversees. He seems willfully ignorant of the reality that the National Petroleum Reserve is more than an untapped oil drum waiting for a straw. The western Arctic contains a world, wild and rich and like no place else. It must not be sacrificed.President Warren Harding created the reserve for the United States Navy in 1923, years after Alaskan Natives first showed oil seeps to Yankee whalers. Over the decades the military and a few companies pricked the ground with exploratory wells. Nothing came of it commercially. As a result the place largely remains much as it was \u2014 nearly roadless and all but unpeopled except for the Inupiaq, whose ancestors roamed the region starting at least 13,000 years ago.ChukchiSeaBeaufortSeathe farnorthTeshekpukLakeKasegalukLagoonNATIONALPETROLEUMRESERVECOLVILLE RIVERUtUkok river uplandsthe farnorthTeshekpukLakeKasegalukLagoonNATIONALpETROLEUMRESERVECOLVILLE RIVERUtUkok river uplands\n          The reserve is so large that it\u2019s best understood in pieces.\n        \n          To the south, the towering Brooks Range softens to a vast, rolling plain of tundra flecked with wildflower and cotton grass called the Utukok River Uplands.\n        \n          To the west, near the Bering Strait, lies Kasegaluk Lagoon, a coastal lagoon protected by barrier islands.\n        \n          In the far north, hard by the Arctic Ocean, the land grows as flat and as soggy as a sponge.\n        \n          Defining the southeast border is the Colville River.\n        \n          In the far northeast is the shallow Teshekpuk Lake, larger in area than Lake Tahoe.\n        Each region supports a distinct ecosystem.The Utukok River Uplands are about four times bigger than the largest grassland in the continental United States, according to Debbie S. Miller, who spent four summers in the reserve for her book \u201cOn Arctic Ground.\u201d She calls it our Serengeti, pulsing with the migration of the 200,000-strong western Arctic caribou herd, and the bears and wolves that follow them.Peregrine falcons, gyrfalcons, golden eagles and rough-legged hawks perch like hood ornaments on the bluffs of the Colville River, which scientists say is one of the most important raptor nesting areas in the world.As co-owner of the guiding outfit Arctic Wild, Michael Wald has paddled the Colville and many other rivers in NPR-A. He adores the reserve. \u201cIt\u2019s the last place you can go and hide from the 21st century,\u201d Mr. Wald said.The Kasegaluk Lagoon is home to thousands of beluga whales, spotted seals and polar bears. Walruses gather in huge rookeries on Kasegaluk\u2019s beaches as ice floes, their preferred resting and feeding places, melt away, making these shores a key substitute as climate change upends their world.In the far north lies one of the largest complex of wetlands in all of the Arctic \u2014 an expanse of ponds, streams and marshes larger than Delaware. The centerpiece is the shallow Teshekpuk Lake, larger in area than Lake Tahoe.DUNLINRed PhalaropeRapid development in East Asia has caused a decline in dunlins that also breed in the NPR-A.Experts speculate this species is declining because of increases in the red fox population.Spectacled EiderThe eider is one of just two species from the NPR-A that is listed under the Endangered Species Act.Black BrantYellow-billed loonSince the 1970s, the NPR-A population has increased because of coastal flooding.The NPR-A has the highest concentration of this loon in Alaska.

Exotic returnees include the Arctic tern that can shuttle to and from Antarctica, and another visitor, the bar-tailed godwit, which after pausing to fatten up still more on the Yukon Delta, will fly without pause to New Zealand, a journey of more than 7,000 miles, the longest-known nonstop over-water migration.CANADABird Migration From the NPR-AU.S.Bird locations, each monthMEXICOBird Migration From the NPR-AU.S.Bird locations, each monthCANADABird Migration from the NPR-AU.S.A.Bird locations, each monthMEXICOWhile the Arctic refuge is deservedly famous, researchers in that 2013 study found that when it came to all the species of aquatic birds they were looking for, they found more of them, packed more densely, along the coast of the petroleum reserve, the place that almost no one knows.In 2013, President Obama\u2019s secretary of the interior, Ken Salazar, signed off on a sweeping management plan that earmarked 11.8 million acres, 52 percent of the petroleum reserve, for potential oil and gas development. That land was thought to hold 72 percent of the recoverable oil, according to estimates at the time.The plan also set aside five \u201cspecial areas\u201d for wildlife and other values in the rest of the reserve, in areas that included the Utukok River Uplands, the Colville River and Teshekpuk Lake. Not every acre of these special areas is off limits to oil and gas leasing nor immune to the construction of the pipelines, gravel roads and ice roads in winter needed for resource extraction.Even so, this hard-fought compromise won wide support from sportsmen, Native villages and major environmental groups. It had taken three years to hammer out. Amazingly, no one sued over the final result. \u201cIt did a good job of zoning this big place,\u201d said Melanie Smith, director of conservation science for Audubon Alaska.Land Up for LeaseTracts available for leaseAlready leasedCurrently unavailabledetailParticularlyhigh potentialfor oilTeshekpukLake LAND AVAILABLEFOR LEASECURRENTLYUNAVAILABLEFOR LEASELand Up for LeaseTracts available for leaseAlready leasedCurrently unavailabledetailParticularlyhigh potentialfor oilTeshekpukLake LAND AVAILABLEFOR LEASECURRENTLYUNAVAILABLEFOR LEASELand Up for LeaseTracts available for leaseAlready leasedCurrently unavailableParticularlyhigh potentialfor oil LAND AVAILABLEFOR LEASECURRENTLYUNAVAILABLEFOR LEASEThe 2013 plan strikes the balance that Congress wanted. While the plan isn\u2019t perfect, it mostly works. Wildlife gets protection, while oil companies get annual lease sales in the reserve (1.8 million acres during the Obama administration, the B.L.M. says, hardly an Obama administration lockup of public lands that Mr. Zinke has suggested). In late 2015, ConocoPhillips drew the first commercial oil from Native land within the reserve. The company is already at work on several other projects there.Now, however, this hard-won compromise is in jeopardy. With big oil finds happening just outside the reserve, and tantalizing new ones within it, state officials want the reserve open wider.First, Mr. Zinke announced on Oct. 25 that every available tract under the 2013 plan would be up for lease, at once. \u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d both in scale and approach, said Nicole Whittington-Evans, the Alaska regional director for the Wilderness Society.\u201cIn the past, the B.L.M. has offered leases based on industry interest,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not based on industry interest, it\u2019s based on a wholesale approach to selling off whatever they can in the NPR-A.\u201dThe next step, many now fear, will be to scrap the 2013 plan entirely. \u201cWe\u2019re viewing this as Step 1,\u201d she said of the lease sale.Indeed, in August, the B.L.M. invited oil companies and the public to nominate parcels they would like to see put up for bid in a future sale. Included on the map were parcels throughout the \u201cspecial areas\u201d that are now off limits to drilling. Stacie McIntosh, the B.L.M.\u2019s Arctic district manager, said the announcement was intended to gauge future interest, and that there could be no lease sales there until after thorough environmental review.But the writing is on the wall.North of the lake is also a protected calving area for the 41,000-animal Teshekpuk caribou herd.

{"Headline": "G.M. Unveils Its Driverless Cars, Aiming to Lead the Pack", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For more than a year, General Motors has tantalized investors with plans to build its future around self-driving cars.It has regularly announced big investments and progress reports, but the company has kept its prototype vehicles largely under wraps \u2014 until now.On Thursday, G.M. will demonstrate its growing fleet of computer-operated, battery-powered Chevrolet Bolts in San Francisco to dozens of investment analysts, who are eager to evaluate the automaker\u2019s advanced test vehicles.The event represents a critical step for G.M. as it seeks to establish leadership in the hotly contested race to bring driverless cars to market.And although G.M. has been reluctant to show off the cars it has developed through a subsidiary, Cruise Automation, the company now wants to prove that self-driving models are getting closer to general use.\u201cEverything we are doing is geared to speed,\u201d G.M.\u2019s president, Daniel Ammann, told journalists at an event showcasing the cars on Tuesday.To emphasize the company\u2019s progress, Mr. Ammann said the cars would be ready for consumer applications in \u201cquarters, not years.\u201dMeeting that goal would probably give G.M., the nation\u2019s largest automaker, a jump on other companies developing self-driving models.Industry analysts say autonomous vehicles could generate billions of dollars in additional revenue and profit for automakers and technology companies, primarily by selling or leasing them to ride-hailing services, taxi fleets and delivery companies.For G.M., the self-driving program is a cornerstone to long-term growth that is not dependent on simply selling vehicles to individual drivers.\u201cG.M. has changed the narrative of the company\u2019s future,\u201d Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a research report on Tuesday.Other automakers, such as Ford Motor, Volkswagen and Toyota, are pushing to accelerate their own electric and autonomous-vehicle programs.The field is also crowded with competitors from Silicon Valley, such as Google, Apple, Uber and the electric-car maker Tesla.G.M. has a blend of financial resources, automotive experience and management resolve that position it strongly to compete with other automakers and big tech companies. But it also has a legacy of failures to overcome \u2014 none bigger than its collapse into bankruptcy in 2009.The scandal slowed G.M.\u2019s comeback, but it also galvanized its executives to focus on making its cars safer, and ultimately to pursue development of fully autonomous vehicles.\u201cG.M. is a much more entrepreneurial company now than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said David E. Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cThat has happened since the bankruptcy \u2014 the fact they are no longer wedded to doing things the way they did in the past.\u201dIn the summer of 2015, Ms. Barra and other senior G.M. executives began a series of visits to California, to study advances in self-driving cars and to scout potential partners in developing autonomous models.In addition to observing how companies like Google were developing driverless technology, the executives became acquainted with work being done by Cruise Automation, a tiny start-up working out of a San Francisco warehouse.By February of last year, officials decided that if G.M. was serious about the race to build the car of the future, it had to move quickly \u2014 or risk falling further behind.\u201cWe had to be very honest with ourselves,\u201d Mr. Ammann recalled recently. \u201cThere were some capabilities we did not have and that we needed to have if we really wanted to pursue this.\u201dAnd it was up to Mr. Ammann \u2014 an industry outsider born in New Zealand who worked as a Wall Street investment banker before joining G.M. \u2014 to deliver the crucial piece.He concluded that the perfect match was Cruise, which had fewer than 40 employees but was moving quickly to retrofit basic cars with its self-driving equipment.\u201cWhat they brought us was exactly what we were missing,\u201d Mr. Ammann said.Kyle Vogt, Cruise\u2019s co-founder and software guru, said that he had been intrigued by G.M.\u2019s interest, but hesitant to rush into a partnership with a huge, century-old automaker from Detroit.But after several one-on-one meetings with Mr. Ammann, he became convinced that G.M.\u2019s manufacturing expertise could greatly advance Cruise\u2019s mission.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.\u201cDan said to me, \u2018You want to take the chaos off the roads by introducing this great technology \u2014 can you really deny that we would get there much faster working together?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Vogt said.Mr. Vogt had learned the pitfalls of trying to adapt mainstream cars with expensive cameras, sensors and electronic equipment for use on public roadways. Converting a handful of such vehicles was a challenge. Producing fleets of them seemed beyond Cruise\u2019s abilities.\u201cYou don\u2019t see any start-ups building iPhones,\u201d he said.While Cruise began expanding its San Francisco operation to what is now nearly 400 employees, G.M. set up a team of hundreds of engineers at its technical center in Warren, Mich., to support the self-driving program.A G.M. vice president, Doug Parks, was assigned to work daily with Mr. Vogt and his California team. Together, they designed self-driving Bolts to the safety and quality standards that G.M. applied to its regular cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles.\u201cWe are working fast and furiously,\u201d said Mr. Parks, an engineer who has worked for G.M. for 33 years. \u201cIt is super exciting, and I love what the company is becoming.\u201dMr. Vogt is keen to prove that self-driving models can navigate complex urban environments such as downtown San Francisco, rather than just highways and suburban streets.On Tuesday, journalists from news organizations including The New York Times were given rides in the demonstration models.For 20 minutes, the self-driving Bolts traversed the hilly, narrow and congested streets of the city\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood \u2014 stopping for pedestrians, slowing to pass double-parked vehicles, navigating gently away from bicycles.A Cruise employee was behind the steering wheel, ready to assume control of the car if it misjudged traffic or was headed for a collision. But during a reporter\u2019s ride, no driver intervention was required.The car traveled more slowly than driver-operated vehicles on the road, and seemed to exercise extreme caution rounding corners or avoiding obstacles. Yet it covered more than two miles without a hitch, despite encountering what its onboard computer said were 265 people, 49 bicycles and 489 cars.Mr. Ammann beamed when details of the test ride were shared, declaring, \u201cThis technology is coming along faster than anyone thinks.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There are a lot of three letter gluey bits in the grid, but I think that as Mr. Poulos gains more experience and fine-tunes his word lists, that will get better, especially since he seems to be aware of the issue to begin with.What a great idea for a theme! Given the word-nerdy kinship between neologism watchers and crossword lovers, I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s the first time this theme has been attempted.The American Dialect Society has been awarding Word of the Year honors since 1990, but maybe it took this long for the stars to align just right \u2014 after all, the last two WOTY winners, SINGULAR THEY (2015) and DUMPSTER FIRE (2016), are nicely symmetrical (12 letters, with the same 8-4 enumeration).34A: The start of the season, other than the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade, is TIS, as is \u201cTis the season.\u201d26D: \u201cApril Fools sign?\u201d is not looking for sign of a prank, but of the astrological sign for April 1. That would be ARIES.This puzzle came about as a result of a minor philosophical crisis.I\u2019d read a blog post where the author was complaining about a puzzle that he felt \u201clacked fresh fill.\u201d This complaint surprised me, because I\u2019d personally found the puzzle in question to be quite lively.It got me wondering: what do we mean when we talk about \u201cfresh fill\u201d? What separates perfectly O.K., workhorse words from gnarly crosswordese? Can clever cluing turn a stale word fresh? And when does a word go from \u201cfresh\u201d to faddish, twee, or just plain annoying?I soon began to doubt everything I knew about cruciverbalism and, indeed, language itself.Around the same time, I read on Language Log (a blog run by an international supergroup of academic linguists) that the American Dialect Society had recently announced \u201cDUMPSTER FIRE\u201d as their 2016 Word of the Year. It struck me that if there were one word everyone could agree on as \u201cfresh,\u201d surely it\u2019d be the A.D.S. Word of the Year.So I made a puzzle based on that idea.My initial plan was to seed the past several years\u2019 winners anywhere I could fit them into a grid. But when I looked at the WotY list, I realized the word lengths might allow for symmetric placement. Luckily, I was able to pull it off.I\u2019m super-duper thrilled for this to be my debut puzzle in The Times. Thanks to my friends and family (especially Cliff, Nick, and the Daves Madden and Sheppard) for their support and feedback. Thanks also to Mr. Shortz for actually accepting this thing, and editing the clues to be better and more consistent overall.My only regret is that UHF is no longer clued as \u201c1989 \u2018Weird Al\u2019 film set at a low-budget TV station.\u201dMaybe this will make you feel better, Mr. Poulos.

On Election Day itself, about 10 million people saw ads purchased by the Kremlin on Facebook, the company has said.Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said the company hoped the tool would help Americans who liked a page or followed an account created by a Russian agent, though he acknowledged that it stopped short of being able to help the much wider circle of people who viewed Russian propaganda shared by their friends.Facebook executives previously said they doubted whether they had the ability to reach out to every single American who was exposed to Russian government-backed propaganda.\u201cIt\u2019s a much more challenging issue to identify and notify reliably people who may have been exposed to this content on an individual basis,\u201d Colin Stretch, the company\u2019s general counsel, said during the appearance before Congress.For now, the tool may only be able to help you if you chose to follow one of the accounts or pages set up by Russian agents on Instagram or Facebook.

This is what the sales factor apportionment system, already in use by most US states, does. Corporations earn income from sales. Therefore income should be allocated based upon the destination of those sales. MNC income should no longer be allocated based upon the location of a subsidiary that allegedly earned it. The location of sales is much more difficult to manipulate than the \u201corigin of income\u201d under the current system.\u201cThe US tax base for corporations would be calculated on the basis of a fraction of companies\u2019 worldwide income. This fraction would be the share of each company\u2019s worldwide sales that are destined for customers in the United States. The taxpayer, under SFA, is the whole unitary business, including all evasion-motivated subsidiaries over which the parent corporations exercise legal and economic control.\u201d\u201cIn effect, firms should be taxed on their access to a specific consumer market - from which they generate revenue - rather than on their cleverness at artificially allocating expenses and revenue in tax havens in which their subsidiaries \u2018incorporate.\u2019\u201d\u201cI think Aspen\u2019s work is needed more than ever.

The government said this month that it plans to resume sales of its holdings by 2019 and hopes to sell some \u00a315 billion of its stake by 2022.That process will be helped if R.B.S. can continue to improve its profitability and its capital position. A return to paying a dividend next year also would be a welcome sign for shareholders.From the WSJ:\u201cBelieve me, I didn\u2019t have this much fun with T.

And there were studies to prove that, even as critics say that tax cuts wouldn\u2019t have such an effect.An economist at the Office of Tax Analysis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize his job, said Treasury had not released a \u201cdynamic\u201d analysis showing that the tax plan would be paid for with economic growth because one did not exist.Instead, Treasury staffers have done smaller analyses of individual provisions.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedStarting with putting his 65,000-acre Mesa Vista Ranch in Texas up for sale, with a price tag of $250 million.Slowly but inevitably, my fading vision and limited hearing have forced me to give up things I\u2019ve loved and excelled at \u2014 golf and hunting, in particular.

It also highlights the potential financial impact of those violations.Much of Mr. Lauer\u2019s power stemmed from the bond he had forged with viewers as the longest tenured host in the program\u2019s 65 years. The first two hours of \u201cToday\u201d \u2014 Mr. Lauer\u2019s showcase \u2014 generated $508 million in revenue last year, more than the amount brought in by the other network morning shows, according to Kantar Media.And while \u201cToday\u201d trails ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in total viewers, it still leads in the coveted 25-to-54 advertising demographic.The bigger pictureAt the end of the day, any company is better off \u2014 and I do mean financially better off \u2014 without someone who uses their power for inappropriate sexual behavior that makes the workplace a threatening place for colleagues and stymies women\u2019s ability to climb the ranks.A senior financial executive phoned Michael last night to complain about how the Senate tax plan would endanger the private equity industry because it limits the deductibility of corporate debt interest payments \u2014 and applies that even to existing investments. The provision could completely upend the private equity business model, this person asserted.Dell took on about $50 billion in debt for its merger with EMC Corp. At a roughly 5 percent interest rate, that means the company has about $2 billion in annual interest payments. The House and Senate bills would remove at least half those deductions, Mr. Vallone said in an interview Wednesday. At a 20 percent tax rate, that\u2019s a $200 million hit each year.The state of playThe Senate could vote as soon as tomorrow on its tax plan. But there are plenty of unresolved matters:While the 3.7 percent drop in an index tracking Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google was the biggest in 21 months, the amount of lost money exceeded any other single day on record. At about $60 billion, the decline in their combined market value is poised to eclipse any since Facebook arrived in public markets.What\u2019s behind the drop?

{"Headline": "Seeking a Voice, via a Bilingual M.F.A., in Writing and in Life", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the students around the table comment in Spanish, sometimes switching languages to highlight a point for the native English speakers. Ms. Cote-Botero hangs back, periodically interjecting in either language. A student from Mexico City consults another from Las Vegas on a passage in Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cGreat Gatsby,\u201d occasionally glancing at Google Translate on a laptop.El Paso\u2019s Masters of Fine Arts program, started in 2006, draws mostly local residents from both sides of the border. A dozen of the 20 students are native Spanish speakers, and all speak at least some English and Spanish. They are motivated by the desire to write and read in another tongue, and to study with professors versed in other cultures. One student, a Texan of Palestinian descent, hopes the program will help her better express herself in Arabic.While El Paso\u2019s program is a unique educational experience, creative writing programs across the country are developing Spanish-based curriculums \u2014 a growth reflecting the nation\u2019s changing demographics: Spanish is the primary language of more than 40 million people in the United States, up from 32 million in 2005, according to Census Bureau estimates.Among the emerging programs, California State University in Los Angeles will offer its own bilingual M.F.A. next year. Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., will start a Spanish-language creative writing degree in 2018, similar to one already in place at New York University. Students in the Spanish-language program and its English counterpart at the University of Iowa are now being encouraged to take each other\u2019s classes.\u201cI see all these programs as a unit of sorts,\u201d said Houston\u2019s director, Cristina Rivera-Garza, \u201ca group interested in developing the writers of the 21st century: bilingual, diverse and representative of the communities thriving in the United States.\u201dThe Houston and Cal State programs are also developing activist efforts to support local Hispanic populations (Houston\u2019s has grown by more than 200,000 from 2000 to 2016; Los Angeles County\u2019s by about 600,000). Cal State\u2019s program director, Alex Espinoza, said its students will help residents in largely Spanish-speaking East L.A. write biographical narratives that counter those \u201ctoo often generalized in the media\u201d \u2014 and by the Trump administration.Collectively, the programs could play a significant role in developing young writers who publicly voice varied aspects of the Hispanic experience.\u2022The Ju\u00e1rez-El Paso geography \u2014 two communities intertwined culturally and economically, separated by a parched Rio Grande barely waist deep \u2014 is a topic the students and professors have explored in their literary work. Perhaps the starkest difference between the cities is the drug-related violence on the Ju\u00e1rez side, which they depict with disturbing visceral images and blunt, uncensored vocabulary.Ju\u00e1rez-El Paso is the largest metropolitan area on the border, with a combined population of more than two million, but the walk from downtown Ju\u00e1rez to downtown El Paso takes less than half an hour.Alessandra Narv\u00e1ez-Varela used to walk across that border almost every day from Ju\u00e1rez to classes at the University of Texas, and to help out in the restaurant her family owns in El Paso. She has a B.S. in biology and a B.A. in creative writing. She spent a year in medical school, but \u201cit didn\u2019t feel like it was supposed to feel,\u201d she said. Poetry did. Now 31, in El Paso\u2019s bilingual M.F.A. program, she is writing to reconcile her dual identity and to give voice to women\u2019s issues, especially involving female anatomy, that initially drew her to medicine. \u201cOnce you have that kind of conversation with the body you can\u2019t let it go,\u201d she said.Oddly, while Ms. Narv\u00e1ez-Varela\u2019s deepest roots lie in Spanish, she did not feel confident composing poetry in her native language. Her college writing had always been in English. \u201cMaybe the Spanish speaker in me felt relegated to second-class-citizen status after adopting English as the language for my poetry,\u201d she said.I attended a presentation Ms. Narv\u00e1ez-Varela gave at a national writer\u2019s conference in Los Angeles in which she explained how a workshop in the program had helped her find her Spanish voice.She had written a poem in Spanish called \u201cOvarian Cancer,\u201d filled with graphic imagery (she compared cancer to a bleeding fetus). Classmates had told her the beat pattern didn\u2019t flow and criticized her use of rhyme. Ms. Narv\u00e1ez-Varela realized she had been unconsciously translating from English. She projected on a screen a copy of the poem, hand-edited by classmates, and an English translation, pointing out to the audience phrases she had originally conceived in English.\u201cSpanish, and the way it\u2019s used to create music in poetry, differs radically in terms of syllables and rhyme,\u201d she discovered. \u201cIt was a humbling workshop for me, but an enlightening one, too.\u201dMs. Narv\u00e1ez-Varela went on to explore Mexican and American identities using Spanglish, the mixing of languages in the same sentences. In her poem \u201cReal Mexican,\u201d she describes, in raw and troubling language, a Mexican-American ex-convict so confused about his Hispanic identity he doesn\u2019t know what name to call himself. In the opening line the character says: \u201cTony, To\u00f1o, Antonio, Anthony, it doesn\u2019t matter, honey....\u201d\u201cI had never before adopted a persona that explored Spanglish\u2019s complexity and its meaning to me as a Mexican citizen naturalized in the U.S.,\u201d Ms. Narv\u00e1ez-Varela said. \u201cI realized this was a projection of my own anxieties as a Mexican-American. I had unconsciously judged others by the way they spoke Spanglish.\u201d She said she was trying to show how the character\u2019s use of Spanglish \u201cis a vital manifestation of his identity as a marginalized member of both societies.\u201d\u2022Many important Hispanic fiction writers have attended traditional M.F.A. programs. I spoke with three of the masters \u2014 Sandra Cisneros, Junot D\u00edaz and Esmeralda Santiago \u2014 about how they bridge two languages in their writing and about their graduate school experience. Each said that their M.F.A. programs did not recognize the Spanish-speaking side of their identities, either by assigning Latino authors or by supporting the Spanish element of their work.Ms. Cisneros, who is Mexican-American, described an interaction with her thesis adviser at the prestigious Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop when she began writing \u201cThe House on Mango Street.\u201dShe had written the novella in English but inflected it with Spanish phrasings. The adviser criticized her for overusing the word \u201clittle,\u201d unaware how frequently the suffix \u201cito\u201d \u2014 for little or cute \u2014 is used in Spanish.The incident, she said, impeded her connection to Spanish. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it until after I\u2019d left Iowa,\u201d Ms. Cisneros said. \u201cI was writing a letter in Spanish and I thought, this is the voice of \u2018The House on Mango Street.\u2019\u201dIn her choice of a single word in her native language, Ms. Cisneros was able to greatly affect meaning.When she named the young narrator of \u201cThe House on Mango Street\u201d Esperanza, she wasn\u2019t just giving her a pretty name. \u201cEsperanza\u201d can mean waiting, expectation or hope in English. In the story, the girl poetically expresses a blend of feelings about her name, saying, \u201cIn Spanish, it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color.\u201d\u201cI wanted it to be a traditional name that wouldn\u2019t translate well into U.S. culture,\u201d Ms. Cisneros said, \u201cas well as one that would mean wish, desire and hope.\u201dMr. D\u00edaz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Dominican-American writer, attended Cornell University\u2019s M.F.A. program and now teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In graduate education, he advocates for \u201cties to scholars working on the intersections of languages, on Creoles, on multilingualism.\u201dHe explained his own mental translation process this way: \u201cIf I\u2019m writing a character who is Spanish dominant, they talk and think within me in Spanish and I translate most of it into English. Some words refuse translations \u2014 sometimes it\u2019s the joy of the word, or the energy it pulses with in the original Spanish sentence.\u201d For example, Mr. Diaz freely employs English expletives in his work, but sometimes opts for rough Spanish equivalents.Ms. Santiago, author of the memoir \u201cWhen I Was Puerto Rican\u201d and an M.F.A. graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, writes entire drafts bilingually. \u201cI write as fast as I can and don\u2019t worry whether what appears on the page is in English or in Spanish,\u201d she said. \u201cLater, when I\u2019m editing, I will translate almost all of the Spanish into English if it\u2019s for publication in that language. English and Spanish are for me the same language.\u201d\u2022In the El Paso program, faculty members strive to respond effectively to students who write in English, Spanish or both. Professors try to accommodate students in individual conferences by working in their preferred language. \u201cI\u2019ll speak in English and they\u2019ll speak in Spanish,\u201d said Daniel Chac\u00f3n, one of 10 faculty members. \u201cThen I might reiterate and clarify in Spanish.\u201dWhatever their level of proficiency, students must grapple with both languages. \u201cThey have to make the effort to bridge the gap,\u201d said the director, Jos\u00e9 de Pi\u00e9rola. \u201cIt can be a shock to be stressed in this way, but it makes you grow.\u201dIn one of Mr. de Pi\u00e9rola\u2019s workshops, a student who spoke little Spanish led a group critique of a student\u2019s short story. The story was in English, but he could not understand the group members who spoke in Spanish, and had to turn for explanations to fully bilingual classmates.Many of the readings are available in translation, but even the students who feel challenged reading in the second language are encouraged to wrestle with the original texts. Some rely on tools like Google Translate, despite its limitations for interpreting literary language.\u201cWhen the Spanish speakers read American poets in English and vice versa, it changes their relationship to their own tradition,\u201d Ms. Cote-Botero said.She described how she might teach students to experiment with their writing by contrasting English and Spanish versions of the sonnet. She explained that Shakespeare standardized the English line using a steady five-beat pattern. \u201cIt\u2019s closest to English speech and to the heartbeat,\u201d she said.One widely quoted example is Shakespeare\u2019s opening line \u201cShall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day?\u201d The Spanish form, on the other hand, is based on a 14-syllable line. When students \u201cmix the two, interesting things appear,\u201d she said. By remaining \u201cinside the boundaries of your own tradition you\u2019re more at risk for repeating yourself.\u201dWith a bilingual approach, Mr. Chac\u00f3n said, \u201cyou can play with your own language a little more. James Joyce was able to play with language because he grew up with Gaelic and paid attention to its sound.\u201dTo expose his students to writing styles in other languages, he adds to his reading lists translations of Japanese Zen koans and the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle.By encouraging students to explore different literary traditions and settings, the El Paso program is about more than just two languages.Looking back as she approaches graduation next month (her thesis is a book of poetry about women), Ms. Narv\u00e1ez-Varela said that writing bilingually has pushed her beyond her comfort zone. This was a key reason she chose the program, and she hopes to carry that experience into a community college teaching position.As a Mexican woman exploring life beyond the border, she will continue through her poems, she said, to \u201cask the hard questions, and expect no answers, or several, as playfully and passionately as possible.\u201dErik Gleibermann is director of the writing program Socratics Mentoring, based in San Francisco.Advertisement"}
