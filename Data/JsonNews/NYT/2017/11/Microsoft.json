McAtee II said in a statement:\u201cToday\u2019s DOJ lawsuit is a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrustprecedent. Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefitconsumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimatereason for our merger to be treated differently.\u201cFortunately, the Department of Justice doesn\u2019t havethe final say in this matter. Rather, it bears the burden of proving to the U.S. DistrictCourt that the transaction violates the law. We are confident that the Court will rejectthe Government\u2019s claims and permit this merger under longstanding legal precedent.\u201dAs the New York Times pointed out in August:\u201cThe Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, Chinese companies that dominate their home market, have rocketed this year to become global investor darlings...While American technology giants dominate people\u2019s online lives in Western countries, Tencent and Alibaba have soared by essentially carving up China, the world\u2019s single-largest internet market with more than 700 million online users.\u201d\u201cTheir rise is emblematic of a rebalancing of global technological influence. In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.\u201dThe world\u2019s largest banks have become better capitalized since financial crisis. They have raised more than $1.5 trillion in capital, according to the Financial Stability Board. That provides the banks with \u201cbuffers as much as 10x higher than a decade,\u201d writes S&P Global.But these financial instutions have also gotten much larger since the financial crisis.In the United States, for example, JPMorgan Chase has nearly doubled in size since the end of 2006. Bank of America has increased its asset by more than 50 percent, and Wells Fargo\u2019s assets are up more than 300 percent from their pre-crisis levels, according to S&P Global.Much of those increases are a result of deals struck during the heights of the crisis. JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual; Bank of America acquired CountryWide and Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo purchased Wachovia.Still the size of these banks is noteworthy. The \u2018too big to fail\u2019 distinction has drawn scrutiny from the Trump administration this year. A report from the Treasury Department last month \u201cdiscussed the need to eliminate regulation \u2018that fosters the creation or cements the market position of too-big-to-fail institutions\u2019 in order to prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts.\u201dA surprising percentage of respondents to DataTrek Research\u2019s bitcoin/cryptocurrency survey don\u2019t think so.\u2022 Just 39.4 percent of respondents said they believe bitcoin was in a bubble. \u201cWe were ready to see +70% responses indicating bitcoin\u2019s price is unsustainable. Less than 40% is, well, remarkable,\u201d writes DataTrek\u2019s co-founder Nicholas Colas.\u2022 Slightly more than 27 percent expect bitcoin to rise but at much slower pace. Just 16% think the value of bitcoin will double in the next six months.\u2022 \u201cA sizeable minority of respondents (39 \u2013 40 percent) see bitcoin as a potential analog to physical gold, both as a safe haven and a hedge against mistakes in central bank monetary policy,\u201d Mr. Colas writrs. Nearly 41 percent consider bitcoin a safe haven similar to gold, and 39 percent view bitcoin as a hedge against monetary policy.Would the Republican from Maine end up working to defeat the Senate\u2019s tax overhaul, as she did with attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act? Or would she simply lobby for changes to make it more acceptable?\u2022 \u201cIt is a simple but true concept, customers drive business growth, not tax rates, not mythical \u2018job creators.\u2019 Tax rates impact profitability, but are only very indirectly tied to hiring.\u201d\u2022 \u201cLabor markets determine salaries, not tax rates.\u201d\u2022 \u201cAs a C.E.O. and member of the board of directors at a public company, I can tell you that if we had an increase in profitability we would have been delighted but it would not lead in and of itself to more hiring or an increase in wages.\u201dThe euro has recovered from its initial decline after the news that Germans might have to go to the polls. But that hasn\u2019t eased the anxiousness of some market commentators.\u201cAngela Merkel\u2019s position seems to be significantly weakened. This could leave Europe\u2019s largest economy politically paralyzed for the time being, reducing the chances for any breakthrough in the E.U. reform agenda or the Brexit negotiations.\u201d\u201cEven if there are re-elections, that is very unlikely to be populist. That\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be a limited down reaction.\u201dAfter the financial crisis, the federal government was expected to aggressively pursue criminal cases against top financiers. Prosecutions were rare, except with obscure, or relatively junior, industry players against whom it was easy to build cases, because prosecutors were under pressure to move quickly and win cases.Philip Baker became one of those targets.He was not a big fish. But the desire to resolve the case swiftly led a powerful United States attorney to insert a transfer-to-Canada clause into an otherwise airtight plea agreement.In 2011, the government allowed Comcast to absorb NBCUniversal in another \u201charmless\u201d vertical merger (a deal that I opposed). Afterwards, Comcast was caught discriminating against rival cable channels and slowing down rival online video services. All the while, America tumbled down global broadband rankings. So much for \u201csynergies.\u201dUnlike Mr. Geithner, however, Mr. Lew already had a background in finance, having worked at Citigroup. The current Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was a partner at Goldman Sachs and a hedge fund founder before joining the Trump administration.The iPhone maker\u2019s vice president of diversity and inclusion, Denise Young Smith, is leaving after only six months in the role \u2014 and after she made controversial remarks about how she thinks of diversity extending beyond race and gender.\u201cI should take that as a compliment that I look like a villain in a great, successful James Bond movie.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Microsoft and Nintendo are offering new or upgraded consoles after Sony rereleased its PlayStation 4 console and more powerful PS4 Pro last year.The arrival this week of Microsoft\u2019s new Xbox One X console \u2014 featuring more processing power and 4K resolution, which means more defined picture quality \u2014 is also expected to make waves. The console supports hundreds of games from the Xbox back catalog, including all Xbox One titles, as well as select Xbox 360 titles.All of this is expected to fuel spending on games, which rose 7 percent to $14 billion in the first half of the year from the same period in 2016, according to the NPD Group. \u201cI expect this growth to continue to edge up through the holidays,\u201d said Mat Piscatella, who analyzes the video games industry for NPD.Here are some of the most anticipated games products this holiday season.Activision\u2019s best-selling first-person shooter game returns with a new version developed by Sledgehammer Games.The last three games in the annual franchise used futuristic settings and high-tech weapons, but the latest version returns to a World War II setting. Sledgehammer Games enlisted the help of a war historian, Martin Morgan, to help create accurate weapons and locations for the game, from the Normandy landings in June 1944 to the Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest. The game follows a young soldier from Texas as he makes his way across Europe with his unit.Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said Call of Duty: World War II would most likely be the biggest game of the holiday season. He projected it would sell 20 million units for a cool $1 billion.Released: Nov. 3Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One\u201cThe game has a movie coming out to support its marketing efforts, and is an easy gift for grandma to purchase at holiday,\u201d said Mr. Pachter.Release: Nov. 17Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox OneSuper Mario Odyssey is the first main Mario platforming game \u2014 in which players must make well-timed, precise jumps across a series of platforms while collecting power-ups and avoiding enemies and obstacles \u2014 for the Nintendo Switch.The game follows Mario as he traverses dozens of colorful worlds in search of his beloved Princess Peach. Odyssey is less linear than previous 3-D Mario games, rewarding exploration and introducing players to new mechanics \u2014 for example, Mario can use his iconic cap to \"possess\u201d other characters or objects, allowing him more freedom to explore. The worlds are also more expansive, including a towering cityscape inspired by New York.So far, reviews have been rapturous. \u201cSuper Mario Odyssey now joins that very short list of what we think are essential games to play and own,\u201d said Randolph Ramsay, the editor in chief of GameSpot, a video game news and reviews site owned by CBS.Released: Oct. 27Platform: Nintendo SwitchAfter a year off in 2016, the action-adventure franchise has returned with a game that transports players to ancient Egypt.The game is set much earlier \u2014 in the first century B.C., around the time of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra \u2014 than previous Assassin\u2019s Creed games, so players can explore the beginnings of the Brotherhood of Assassins, a renegade group fighting for freedom. The game\u2019s combat system has been overhauled, with the duel-style action of previous games replaced by a lock-on mechanic that means enemies don\u2019t really wait before they attack.In addition, players can now pursue or leave quests whenever they like, instead of having to finish off a quest to return to the main world.Released: Oct. 27Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox OneNintendo\u2019s console has been a hit with hard-core and casual gamers alike. As Nintendo\u2019s first new home console since the Wii U in 2012, the Switch remains in tight supply \u2014 and demand is not slowing.Reviews for the Switch have been unanimously positive, praising its streamlined design and ability to seamlessly switch between at home and on the road without affecting how the games look and play.\u201cNot only does it have two of the best games released this year \u2014 The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey \u2014 it\u2019s also an impressive piece of gaming tech that works well both as a home console and a portable machine,\u201d Mr. Ramsay of GameSpot said.Released: March 3Price: $299.99The console is a miniaturized rerelease of the classic SNES console from the 1990s, a kind of novelty box that comes loaded with 21 games, including Super Mario World, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Final Fantasy III.The console plugs directly into a TV via HDMI, so players can use their current tech setup to play their childhood favorites.\u201cThe Super NES Classic is a surefire glorious trip down memory lane,\u201d Mr. Ramsay said.Released: Sept. 29Price: $79.99Microsoft is hoping its new Xbox One X console can become the ideal partner to 4K televisions that promise better picture quality and higher resolutions.Microsoft has touted the Xbox One X as the most powerful console on the market, with more memory and bandwidth to allow better-looking games and faster loading times.But the device is priced relatively high: $499, compared with less than $300 for consoles like the Xbox One S and Sony\u2019s PS4. As a result, the Xbox One X may not immediately be a mainstream gaming product, at least not until far more people own 4K televisions.Released: Nov. 7Price: $499Advertisement"}

But by Governor Brown\u2019s own assessment, decarbonizing the country, much less the planet, in time to avoid the worst effects of rising global temperatures is going to take \u201cheroic action.\u201d That suggests both parties would have to develop a bipartisan consensus.\u201cIt\u2019s a real race against time,\u201d Governor Brown said of curbing emissions. \u201cI do think that what\u2019s required is massive, continuous innovation and the investment for that.\u201dThe measure, sponsored by Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, would allow drilling in 2,000 acres of the refuge and split the expected $1.1 billion in revenues over the next decade between Alaska and the federal government.Similar efforts to open the refuge have been made, unsuccessfully, over the decades. But many environmentalists and lawmakers who have worked to thwart those moves told me in recent days they fear the public is not paying attention this time around.Some activists blame the ceaseless stream of news out of Washington. Others note that the drilling provision is tucked into a largely unrelated tax bill. Byron L. Dorgan, a Democratic former senator from North Dakota who is now lobbying to block drilling, accused Republicans of trying to open ANWR \u201cunder the cloak of midnight.\u201dProponents of drilling say if the public doesn\u2019t seem as exercised about the Arctic as in years past it\u2019s because common sense is winning the day.\u201cThis is a pro-Alaska, pro-American opportunity,\u201d said Carl Portman, deputy director of the Alaska\u2019s Resource Development Council.

{"Headline": "A New Way for Machines to See, Taking Shape in Toronto", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 In 2012, Geoffrey Hinton changed the way machines see the world.Along with two graduate students at the University of Toronto, Mr. Hinton, a professor there, built a system that could analyze thousands of photos and teach itself to identify common objects like flowers and cars with an accuracy that didn\u2019t seem possible.But as Mr. Hinton himself points out, his idea has had its limits. If a neural network is trained on images that show a coffee cup only from a side, for example, it is unlikely to recognize a coffee cup turned upside down.Now Mr. Hinton and Sara Sabour, a young Google researcher, are exploring an alternative mathematical technique that he calls a capsule network. The idea is to build a system that sees more like a human. If a neural network sees the world in two dimensions, a capsule network can see it in three.Ms. Sabour is an Iranian researcher who wound up in Toronto after the United States government denied her a visa to study computer vision at the University of Washington.Her task is to turn Mr. Hinton\u2019s conceptual idea into a mathematical reality, and the project is bearing fruit. They recently published a paper showing that in certain situations their method can more accurately recognize objects when viewing them from unfamiliar angles.\u201cIt can generalize much better than the traditional neural nets everyone is now using,\u201d Ms. Sabour said.When I walked into his office this month, Mr. Hinton, dressed in his usual button-down shirt and sweater, handed me two large white blocks. They looked like something he had found at the bottom of an old toy chest.He explained that the blocks were two halves of a pyramid, and he asked if I could put the pyramid back together. That didn\u2019t seem too hard. The blocks were oddly shaped, but each had only five sides. All I had to do was find the two sides that matched and line them up. But I couldn\u2019t.Most people fail this test, he told me, including two tenured professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One declined to try, and the other insisted it wasn\u2019t possible. It is possible. But we all failed, Mr. Hinton explained, because the puzzle undercuts the natural way we see something like a pyramid.We do not recognize an object by looking at one side and then another and then another. We picture the whole thing sitting in three-dimensional space. And because of the way the puzzle cuts the pyramid in two, it prevents us from picturing it in 3-D space as we normally would.With his capsule networks, Mr. Hinton aims to finally give machines the same three-dimensional perspective that humans have \u2014 allowing them to recognize a coffee cup from any angle after learning what it looks like from only one. This is not something that neural networks can do.\u201cIt is a fact that is ignored by researchers in computer vision,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is a huge mistake.\u201dLoosely modeled on the web of neurons in the human brain, neural networks are algorithms that can learn discrete tasks by identifying patterns in large amounts of data. By analyzing thousands of car photos, for instance, a neural network can learn to recognize a car.This mathematical idea dates back to the 1950s, but the concept has found real-world applications in recent years, thanks to improvements in processing power and the large amounts of data generated by the internet. Over the last five years, neural networks have accelerated the progress of everything from smartphone digital assistants to language translation services to autonomous robots.But these methods are still a long way from delivering machines with true intelligence \u2014 and new research is needed to deliver the kinds of autonomous machines that so many of the top tech companies are now promising, including conversational computers and driverless cars.Mr. Hinton, who is a kind of godfather figure for the A.I. community, is part of a small but increasingly vocal group of specialists who are working to push the industry into these alternative areas of research.Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, based in Seattle, lamented what he called the industry\u2019s myopia. Its current focus on neural networks, he said, will hurt the progress of A.I. in the long run.Eric Horvitz, who oversees much of the A.I. work at Microsoft, argued that neural networks and related techniques were small advances compared with technologies that would arrive in the years to come.\u201cRight now, what we are doing is not a science but a kind of alchemy,\u201d he said.Mr. Hinton acknowledges that his project in Toronto has so far shown only preliminary results. And others, like Mr. Etzioni and Mr. Horvitz, believe that very different techniques will be needed to achieve truly intelligent machines. Mr. Etzioni said that although machine learning methods would remain at the center of A.I. work, they must be augmented with other techniques. They are fundamentally limited because they learn from data. The right data isn\u2019t always available.But Mr. Hinton believes his capsule networks can eventually expand to a wider array of situations, accelerating the progress of computer vision and things like conversational computing. Capsule networks are an attempt to mimic the brain\u2019s network of neurons in a more complex and structured way, and he explained that this added structure could help other forms of artificial intelligence as well.He certainly understands that many will be skeptical of his technique. But Mr. Hinton also pointed out that five years ago, many were skeptical of neural networks.\u201cHistory is going to repeat itself,\u201d he said. \u201cI think.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Technologies That Will Rock Your World", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is reason for concern, but also for optimism. The new wave of artificial intelligence will reduce jobs, but will also improve your health and products like your smartphone. Here are five areas where tech companies, large and small, will change the way we live.Such technology will improve health care in places where doctors are scarce. But eventually, it will streamline care in the developed world as well. Google is already running tests inside two hospitals in India, and the start-up Infervision has deployed similar technology in hospitals across China.In the longer term, similar methods promise to rapidly accelerate drug discovery and so many other aspects of health care. \u201cEverything from the nature of the food that we grow and eat to the drugs that we give ourselves to how we monitor the impact of these things is all being transformed by A.I. in deeply profound ways,\u201d said Matt Ocko, a managing partner at DCVC, a San Francisco venture capital firm that has invested heavily in this area.Neural networks are not limited to image recognition. Far from it. These same techniques are rapidly improving coffee-table gadgets like the Amazon Echo, which can recognize spoken commands from across the room, and online services like Skype, which can instantly translate phone calls from one language to another. They may even eventually produce machines that can carry on a conversation.Recently, said Luke Zettlemoyer, a University of Washington professor, there has been a \u201chuge phase shift\u201d in the area of natural language understanding \u2014 technology that understands the natural way people talk and write. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are at the forefront of this movement, which promises to fundamentally change how we interact with phones, cars, and potentially any machine. Many companies are moving down the same path, including Replika, a San Francisco start-up.With help from machine learning, Replika offers a smartphone \u201cchatbot\u201d that acts as a kind of personal confidante, chatting with you in moments when no one else is around. But the hope is that these techniques will improve to where they serve you in so many other ways. What if Alexa was truly conversational, if you could have a back and forth dialogue? Right now, it is about basic questions and commands. Today, it \u201crecognizes\u201d words very very well. But truly \u201cunderstanding\u201d complex English sentences is beyond machines at this point. What if machines could carry on a dialogue like Hal in 2001?Using electroencephalography, or EEG \u2014 a longstanding means of measuring electrical brain activity from sensors placed on the head \u2014 the start-up Neurable is building a virtual reality game that can be played with the mind. EEG is limited for this kind of use, but other researchers, including at Facebook, aim to build a far more powerful systems using optical sensors. Facebook hopes that, in a few years, this technology will let people type with their minds five times faster than they can with a smartphone keyboard.These techniques will also face physical limits, and that may bar the way to Facebook\u2019s goal. But various start-ups, including Neuralink, founded by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, are going several steps further, hoping to read brain activity from chips implanted inside the skull. At first, they will limit this technology to people with disabilities. But ultimately, Mr. Musk and others hope to also implant chips in healthy people.\u201cIt is implausible that this technology would go straight into healthy people,\u201d said Ed Boyden, an M.I.T. neuroscientist who is also an adviser to Neuralink. \u201cBut there is a natural trajectory where, if a medical technology proves effective, it can move into normal individuals as well.\u201dWant more science fiction in your everyday reality? As entrepreneurs like Mr. Musk work to put a chip in your head, others are working to put cars in the skies.At first, Kitty Hawk will sell its vehicles to hobbyists. But the company hopes it can eventually convince the general public, and regulators, that flying cars make sense. That is no easy task. After all, these cars will require a new kind of air traffic control.Even more outlandish? It\u2019s the prospect of a quantum computer. Drawing on the seemingly magical properties of quantum physics, such a machine would be exponentially more powerful than computers of today. Think of it this way: A quantum computer could instantly crack the encryption that protects the world\u2019s most private data.The problem is that these machines are enormously difficult to build. but progress has accelerated. Google, IBM and Intel are investing heavily in this push, as are start-ups like Rigetti Computing.Researchers say they believe that quantum machines eventually could accelerate drug discovery, streamline financial markets, solve traffic problems and more.\u201cIt is a completely different paradigm for processing information,\u201d said Robert Schoelkopf, who helped invent the techniques that are driving so much of quantum computing research. \u201cSo we think that known applications are just the tip of the iceberg.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rev-Up: Imagining a 20% Self-Driving World", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "Call it 20 percent: the day, if it ever arrives, that one out of five vehicles you encounter will be driving itself. In some ways, the 20 percent era is harder to imagine than the fully automated era, because this supposedly unstoppable and frictionless technology will still be embroiled in a total mess. The best, safest models will most likely come with the highest price tags, out of reach for those with average incomes. Coexistence between human and robot drivers will be uneasy at best; road rage against the machine will boil over. One catastrophic accident could still imperil the whole experiment, no matter what the overall statistics show.But that inevitable mess is precisely what makes the one-in-five future so interesting to ponder. It\u2019s the first point, give or take, when it will be clear that a true self-driving future is even possible. When car companies will actually be able to rip out the steering wheels from some models, designing them in entirely different ways. When big trucking firms and car services like Uber will have begun to remove drivers from their vehicles. When hypercommuters will trust their cars to drive them three hours to the office while they sleep. When you might risk putting your child in one, alone.The autonomous vehicle went from test-track prototype to showroom reality far faster than I envisioned, propelled as much by advances in sensors and A.I. as by a collective hype cycle that seemed intent on willing these devices into existence, whether society was ready for them or not. Sitting with that \u201cbeginner\u201d driver in 2008, as engineers closely observed its movements, took me back to that life-defining moment of getting a driver\u2019s license. In my wallet, sparse with a library card and a school-lunch ticket, the license had real heft. It represented a primordial entry point to adulthood, a vast expansion of social possibility.As a rite, the driver\u2019s exam \u2014 I have failed it in two countries \u2014 is a ritual by turns (three-point, of course!) tedious and terrifying. If you can summon nothing else of the 1988 teen comedy \u201cLicense to Drive,\u201d you can still see James Avery\u2019s gleefully malevolent D.M.V. examiner, wielding his famous coffee cup. Once autonomous technology begins to really take off, will the driver\u2019s license, and the pedagogy behind it, go the way of the stick shift? Will the ability to drive begin to seem some exotic, rarely necessary skill \u2014 like starting a fire with a flint?After all, in a vehicle that meets the Level 5 automation criteria of SAE International \u2014 \u201cfull-time performance by an Automated Driving System for all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions\u201d \u2014 there would seem to be little point in possessing this vestigial skill. We don\u2019t require people entering elevators, riding in airport trams or letting Roombas loose upon their living rooms to be able to take over operation in case of machine failure; it\u2019s hard to see why our interaction with this automated technology should be any different. Our learning process could be as quick and dirty as it is with other high-tech products: Toss out the instruction manual and watch someone do it on YouTube.But this possibility, driver made passenger, broaches new territory in jurisprudence. With no licenses, what is the legal basis for restricting anyone \u2014 tweens, the elderly \u2014 from being ferried about? Young farm kids\u2019 driving the family truck seems as obsolete as tail fins, but what\u2019s stopping kids from being driven? Could children, often more adept at handling the smartphones of their parents than their owners are, have an advantage on older drivers less accustomed to technology? Yet the same fears that keep parents from letting their children walk to school may prevail over the allure of their autonomous vehicle handling the school run. It seems hard to say whether autonomous vehicles would hasten or delay the passage to adulthood.And as drivers interact with semiautonomous vehicles in the long run-up to Level 5, driver education and licensing, far from becoming obsolete, may become more important, argues John D. Lee, a professor of engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cAutomation has a strong tendency to surprise people with unexpected behavior,\u201d he says. Knowing what your car is doing \u2014 and when to take over \u2014 could be more vital than merely knowing how to drive. That water on the road \u2014 is it a surface puddle, or a veritable lake filling a gigantic pothole? That truck ahead with the dangerously swaying load \u2014 do you speed up to pass it? Is the pedestrian by the marked crosswalk waiting for you to yield or simply checking his iPhone? \u201cDriving and managing the automation that is helping you drive,\u201d Lee says, \u201care two quite different skill sets. Automation-management skills need to be learned as much as driving skills.\u201dTom Vanderbilt is the author of \u201cYou May Also Like\u201d and \u201cTraffic.\u201dDriverless cars will sometimes need to move around the city with no humans in them at all \u2014 en route to pickups or drop-offs. As empty moving vehicles become a common sight, they\u2019re sure to enable an annoying off-label use: a flowering youth subculture of external joy riding, similar to subway surfing.All over the country, bored teenagers will lurk on the roadside, waiting to leap onto the roofs of empty cars, hanging on for as long as they can. The surfers will take advantage of advances in cloaking technology to help them confuse the cars\u2019 sensors. Some will develop a clever assortment of grips and attachments to help them stay on, although the best among them will sneer at those who need to use tools. Fatalities will be inevitable, and often gruesome.To keep the kids off, car owners will try to coat their cars in slick repellents; these will be effective but too messy to be practical. Soon, dealers of autonomous cars will offer optional rows of spikes similar to those we already use to keep homeless people off benches. Once again, design will become more hostile in the name of safety.Rollo Romig is a journalist based in New York.Liberated from having to watch the road, commuters\u2019 eyes will be free to \u2014 what else? \u2014 consume video content. Sound\u2019s hold on drive time \u2014 first with terrestrial radio, then satellite radio, then podcasts \u2014 will gave way to sight. But what kind of videos will we watch? If Marchetti\u2019s constant holds (this is the idea that as transportation technology and urban planning change, people contort their lives to keep their commutes to an average of one hour per day), they will be not feature films but TV shows and short videos of the kind being increasingly produced for Facebook and YouTube. Podcasts will be displaced by vodcasts. Media companies are already negotiating with carmakers about how to price their offerings. Should in-car entertainment work more like cable or like the on-demand system in a hotel? Like Netflix or like Roku?Most riders who play games will use their phones. But by the time one in five cars is autonomous, console makers will develop specific products for it. The nearly two hours a day of console gaming played by some 60 million Americans will tick up accordingly. Swarms of commuters hitting the morning and evening roads in waves will become swarms of druids or mercenaries in massively multiplayer online games, some of which might come to incorporate the driving experience itself, a Pok\u00e9mon Go for the highway.It seems less likely that we\u2019ll use this opportunity to steal time back from screens. But if there\u2019s enough space for a table, maybe commuters will sit around it playing poker or telling stories. Cars are, indeed, the most private places we have, sealed shut, out of earshot. (The writer Nicholson Baker has said that he likes to write while in a car parked in a shady spot.)Chris Anderson \u2014 formerly the editor of Wired, now the head of a drone-data company and, in his spare time, of a racing league for autonomous cars \u2014 says the question of what we\u2019ll do inside self-driving cars always comes up at cocktail parties. It always confounds him. \u201cWe have this world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s called the back seat of an Uber.\u201d We already know what passengers do in back seats, be they in a limo or an R.V. or a tour bus: They pull out their phones or their iPads, or they talk to one another, or they take a nap. Why should we think that not having a driver will change anything?In an essay for Real Life magazine titled \u201cPerpetual Motion Machines,\u201d Chenoe Hart argues that we miss something when we think of autonomous cars this way, as a difference in degree, not in kind. Because we won\u2019t have to worry about driving, vehicle interiors can expand to a point where we\u2019 stop thinking of them as vehicles: They might have fully functional kitchens, or gyms, or beds. Instead of going to the coffee shop, the coffee shop might come to you; instead of going into the garage to pull out your car, the garage will be the car. The ability to summon spaces like this, Hart writes, will turn the built environment into a kind of random-access memory \u2014 with every destination equally accessible from anywhere. Whether it drove to you or you to it will be irrelevant; motion will be so smooth and constant as to be imperceptible. Hart argues that when travel becomes fully autonomous, we will always be traveling: families or co-workers in quiet concert on giant roads, moving in a cluster of moving buildings, chasing good weather, hardly aware that we\u2019re going anywhere at all.James Somers is a writer and programmer based in New York.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.It\u2019s not as straightforward as it sounds. For one thing, the vehicles would not be freed from the laws of physics. Should your car abruptly brake while you were, for example, running on a treadmill, the treadmill would cease moving forward \u2014 but you wouldn\u2019t, at least until you hit a windshield or door.It might be easier to remain seated. \u201cThe car could have special pockets all over the place that hold resistance bands of different strengths,\u201d says Bryant Johnson, a personal trainer and the author of \u201cThe Ruth Bader Ginsburg Workout.\u201d \u201cYou could use those to get a full-body strength-training workout.\u201dThroughout your commute, your future car could scrutinize your efforts, says Steve McCauley, the head of health services for the Wynn Las Vegas resort, with fingertip monitors or other sensors tracking your heart rate and the composition of your sweat.But realistically, many of us will use our salvaged commuting time otherwise. In tomorrow\u2019s cars, the area beneath the hood may not be needed for a combustion engine, Vujicic says \u2014 but it will remain, for reasons of mechanical stability and safety. Fitted with some padding and a safety belt, it becomes a napping cave.If self-driving cars start to make up a significant portion of urban traffic, they\u2019re likely to push cities to become more populous and compact, with fewer owned vehicles and more car sharing. The future, that is, would look more like Singapore, one of the world\u2019s densest cities, whose government in recent years has tried to curb car ownership and ease congestion problems. We reached out to Limin Hee, the director of research at Singapore\u2019s Center for Livable Cities, to ask her about how she thinks autonomous cars will begin to change urban life.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.These exploits, though dramatic, took advantage of the same vulnerabilities in cellular networks that might plague any tablet or smart vacuum cleaner. But a future in which one in five vehicles is autonomous will not only increase the attack \u201csurface\u201d (in the metaphor favored by researchers) of the car; it will also force manufacturers to confront more insidious security risks that are only now coming into view. It will become possible to compromise vehicles by hacking the environment.A car that drives itself uses sensors to construct high-resolution images of its surroundings, then runs them through a \u201cclassifier\u201d to identify all the objects in the image. The classifier can do this because it has trained on labeled images; after seeing a hundred thousand trucks, it learns to recognize certain features as indicating truck-ness. Today\u2019s most popular and effective classifiers for object recognition, used widely in self-driving car software, are called deep neural networks.But a deep neural network offers researchers very little understanding of why objects become classified as they do. Think of its output as a map, with each classification corresponding, like a ZIP code, to some demarcated region. Instead of existing in just two dimensions, though, the map has more like a thousand dimensions \u2014 and the slightest move in any one of these dimensions can push us into a different ZIP code and produce a false classification. This makes it possible for a hacker to construct slightly perturbed images, called \u201cadversarial examples,\u201d that look innocuous to the human eye but fool the car\u2019s brain into making the wrong call, with potentially fatal consequences.Adversarial examples are extremely difficult to defend against. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand these attacks,\u201d says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut the deeper question is that we don\u2019t understand deep neural networks.\u201d In a recent paper, Song and her co-authors introduced a method of constructing robust adversarial examples that can even be printed on paper and pasted to road signs. A stop sign defaced with specially calibrated graffiti, for instance, is recognized as a 45 m.p.h. speed-limit sign.Song\u2019s warning extends beyond road infrastructure. While researchers for decades have been working on \u2014 and developing countermeasures for \u2014 software vulnerabilities, the study of security issues related to deep learning is still in its infancy. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a precise mathematical definition of a pedestrian,\u201d Song says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for us to write down a formula describing exactly what a pedestrian is. So we can\u2019t even really define our security goals.\u201d Even with a recent surge of interest in adversarial examples, researchers are still struggling to understand the scope of the problem. Given the physical-world ramifications, Song says, \u201cwe should have started even sooner.\u201dYiren Lu is a writer and software engineer in New York.The trickiest part of the transition to a self-driving future may be figuring out liability when accidents do happen. Instead of quarreling only about which driver was at fault, we will also be able to argue about whether the self-driving features in either car may have played a role. A preview of these complications was evident in the aftermath of the crash that killed Joshua Brown, the Ohio man whose autopiloted Tesla ran into a tractor-trailer. Federal investigators determined that the accident was not caused by a defect in the autopilot software, and Tesla has said repeatedly that drivers should always have their hands on the wheel even when they are using the technology. But officials noted that Tesla\u2019s technology was unable to detect cross-traffic like that presented by the tractor-trailer. Tesla subsequently updated its software to make similar accidents less likely in the future.So who was responsible for covering the damages? The insurance policy that covered Brown, who may not have fully understood the capabilities of his car, or Tesla? Neither Tesla nor Brown\u2019s family has commented on who paid. And both car insurers and insurance regulators have been relatively slow to contend with the difficulty in assigning liability when a person is driving a car only part of the time. \u201cInsurance policies have not necessarily caught up with the global advancement of A.I. technology in cars,\u201d Brown\u2019s lawyer told me.Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley, which is racing to raise the curtain on the era of autonomous vehicles, is also thinking about insurance. A start-up called Driav intends to bring down insurance rates by monitoring the reams of data coming out of self-driving cars in order to figure out, on a second-to-second basis, who or what caused the errors that led to a crash. \u201cIt\u2019s silly that claims are a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 argument,\u201d Dan Peate, Driav\u2019s chief executive, told me. \u201cThe data can just tell us what happened.\u201d The company hopes to begin offering insurance policies next year, with the expectation that they will be cheaper in part because the cars will be in fewer accidents and in part because it plans to be able to shift some liability onto the carmakers.In the long run, when all vehicles are driving themselves, the manufacturers themselves are very likely to assume all of the blame for accidents. Most such companies have said that they plan to pay for anything that happens while their cars and software are in charge. When that\u2019s the case, insurance begins to look a lot more like a product warranty, covered by the carmaker, than a stand-alone product that a customer has to worry about. But in the transition years until then, there are likely to be a lot more messy arguments.Nathaniel Popper is a technology reporter for The Times.When I think about the future these days, I inevitably return to a tweet from the writer Elizabeth Hamilton-Argyropoulos (a.k.a. @bourgeoisalien): \u201cThe saddest part about self-driving cars will be all the times people die mid-trip and then ur dinner guests or pizza guy will arrive dead.\u201d To read this joke is to become immediately certain that this will absolutely happen \u2014 of course it will! \u2014 and that it will furthermore become as much a part of the texture of everyday future life as, say, traffic delays caused by collisions are now. Admittedly, the dead-pizza-guy notion doesn\u2019t seem very likely: A large part of the impetus behind the development of self-driving technology in the first place is the desire to do away with the need for flesh-and-blood people who demand wages for their work. But the image feels symbolically resonant precisely because of the ghostly future of all those moribund jobs. Self-driving cars bearing the earthly remains of the recently deceased \u2014 automated Ubers, say, with heart-attack victims sprawled incredulously across the rear seat \u2014 are, in this sense, an extreme metaphor for the near future of capitalism. The technology will be miraculous, yes; but if it functions as intended, it will serve as an uncanny vector of human obsolescence.Mark O\u2019Connell is a writer based in Dublin.\u201cRide-sharing\u201d was always a misnomer for companies like Uber and Lyft. As with the rest of the \u201csharing economy,\u201d nothing was ever being shared; labor and services were being bought and sold. But as ride-share companies have grown, their ambitions have multiplied and compounded. Currently, their horizons are limited by widespread car ownership, alternative transit options and, primarily, their own cost. But autonomous cars make their grander plans \u2014 dreams of vast fleets of perfectly allocated and used vehicles \u2014 more plausible. They zero out a single variable, the cost of labor, that these companies believe is holding them back from utterly reshaping the world. Ride-share businesses are uniquely poised to manifest and demonstrate the big ideas of self-driving cars. They aren\u2019t waiting for this change; they\u2019re doing everything in their power to hasten it. Autonomous cars aren\u2019t just part of the plan; they are the plan.Conservative estimates put the world\u2019s Ubers and Lyfts in an enviable position as self-driving cars roll out. Bullish projections put them in an unassailable one. A 2017 report by Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest, told the story in four numbers. A rider\u2019s \u201call-in cost per mile\u201d for average United States taxi services was about $3.50. For a human-driven Uber in San Francisco, that number was about $2.86. Assuming the same fuel price, the figure for personal cars is much lower, at around 70 cents. The estimate for self-driving taxi services, circa 2020, would cut that cost in half.At 35 cents per mile, tasks that were previously too expensive or that would have felt ridiculous become reasonable and routine. A world in which moving yourself or moving things to you costs almost nothing in terms of money or attention would remake places and transform lives. It would also bring with it new and complicated absurdities \u2014 the sort Americans adapt to quickly and then forget. (Like bottles of water shipped around the world and sold for $2, or electronics products assembled in one country from parts from six others, to be shipped to a seventh.)Riders will thrill to this new infrastructure as it incorporates the roads around them, providing novel experiences and conveniences. But this excitement will prevent us from seeing that our aspiring fleet managers hope to create something like the profound consolidation of the internet\u2019s recent past. Just as Amazon the online store laid the groundwork for Amazon the comprehensive and omnipresent service, apps for human-driven taxis may have laid the groundwork for a thrumming on-demand grid, on which people and things can be placed and retrieved.Like Google and Facebook before them, which remapped, rerouted and dominated the old and diverse web infrastructure on which they were built, Uber and Lyft could say, credibly, that they work better with size and full participation. That market domination is merely the flip side of completeness. They will aspire to monopoly and could achieve, with startling speed, real and unprecedented claims over the roads we share \u2014 they will say they\u2019ve found a better use for them, and if all goes to plan, riders will agree.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The Times.Unless you\u2019re a millionaire or a truck driver, your first encounter with a self-driving vehicle will probably be a car you ordered through a ride-hailing app like Lyft or Uber. These companies, which spent the first stage of their lives trying to get drivers into their cars, are spending the next one trying to get them out. There will be some initial awkwardness around self-driving vehicles, just as there was around ride-hailing in the first place. (Remember when it was weird to get into a stranger\u2019s unmarked car?)But Lyft, for one, is betting that it can put a trustable face on the tech. In July, it announced Level 5, a lab where it will work on its own driverless software, in addition to developing an open self-driving network that companies like Ford and Jaguar Land Rover will be able to plug their vehicles into. The idea of the network is to combine multiple kinds of autonomous vehicles under one routing-and-request system, so that when you order a Lyft, the app will assess your route, check the weather and other factors and send you the best ride, whether that\u2019s an autonomous Waymo or a human-driven S.U.V. John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s co-founder and president, explained its thinking.Kevin Roose is a business columnist for The Times and a writer at large for the magazine.For reasons that have gone unstudied, humans become horny in transit. With the proliferation of subway systems came the proliferation of subway gropers. With commercial air travel came the \u201cMile High Club.\u201d Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee filmed their famous sex tape on a boat (I\u2019m told). There\u2019s something about transportation that gets people in the mood. What is it?My theory is simple. In our capacity as humans, we have three speeds at which we operate: crawl, walk and run. In other words: extremely slow, slow and slightly less slow. When we engage with equipment that increases our velocity, we become excited. This excitement applies in all cases, whether we\u2019re talking about an escalator, a moving walkway, a bicycle, a roller coaster, a golf cart or a Chrysler LeBaron. It is fundamentally thrilling to travel at an unexpected speed. When the enabling mode of transportation is one that permits our excitement to be processed as erotic energy \u2014 even if that processing is specifically legislated against \u2014 some of us will do that. The distance between \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cstimulated\u201d is, after all, incredibly short. If there were a way to have sex on a bicycle, people would be bike-sexing all the time. It would have its own verb.Having sex in a car is not currently impossible, but it is difficult. Hand-eye coordination, a mechanism critical for sex-having, is compromised for the driver, whose hands must remain on the wheel and eyes on the road. In road couplings, the driver is not an equal contributor. Unless, of course, the driver doesn\u2019t need to drive at all. Which brings us to the self-driving car: basically a motel room on wheels. The one hindrance to this development is existing public-lewdness laws, which are fairly expansive. You can\u2019t intentionally get naked and perform a \u201clewd act\u201d in a public place without risk of penalty. Obviously. But you also run a risk if you perform your lewd act in a private place with the intention of being watched \u2014 say, in a self-driven automobile slowly cruising past a school bus where my future grandchildren are watching in horror as a frenzied orgy unfolds within smelling distance. I am confident, however, that the law will be updated to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable car-based encounters.And if not, industrial designers can come up with clever \u201csolves,\u201d the word that start-ups use for some reason instead of \u201csolutions.\u201d If car windows no longer need to function as navigating aids, why not tint them to inky obscurity? Or replace them with mirrors facing outward? Or mirrors facing inward? Or remove them entirely? Future riders may not even need a human partner in order to have an intimate appointment. Nissan is working with Microsoft to develop an \u201cin-vehicle virtual personal assistant\u201d which, if deviously hacked, could provide the 21st-century equivalent of phone sex.More interesting than the aesthetics of car sex will be the cultural consequences. New slang terms will arise. New positions. New trophies. (How many times can you have sex in the time it takes to drive from Las Vegas to Los Angeles?) Virginities will be lost, children conceived, marriage vows consummated and violated. Car-based kinks will be minted and postcoital rituals established. New professional opportunities will emerge: interior decorators who specialize in \u201cself-driving bedrooms\u201d; entrepreneurs who launch apps to enable no-strings-attached in-car assignations. Preferences will be identified and explored. The world will expand in narrow but pulse-quickening ways \u2014 not a sexual revolution, but a plot twist.Molly Young is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

And because most of Spacewar\u2019s early users were programmers, many of them did indeed modify it, eventually adding mines, more inertia and even an early form of virtual reality.While PC games were subsequently found to be protected by copyright, the industry has continued to foster a culture of innovation. A low technical barrier to entry has allowed developers to build the extraordinary computing, graphic and interactive technologies that regularly put PC gaming years ahead of its console counterparts. \u201cThe PC is the home of innovation,\u201d says Mat Piscatella, a video game industry analyst at The NPD Group. \u201cThere are no limits to what a developer can create on the PC platform. Developers can experiment without being restricted by certification costs or other platform-holder restrictions.\u201dThe PC\u2019s innovation story continues to evolve. There are nearly 570 million PC gamers in the world, according to Jon Peddie, the president of Jon Peddie Research. That number is likely to grow as new distribution technologies, emergent interactive gaming styles and low-price, high-end PCs like the new Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming further democratize PC gaming. More casual gamers are joining the fold, and they\u2019re doing so on new laptops that are affordable for holiday gifting and versatile enough to use for work and entertainment.Online distribution platforms have been a boon for game developers, and they\u2019re passing the benefits onto players. For game producers, the old process of manufacturing games on cartridges and discs for retail was expensive and creatively suffocating. \nBy digitally distributing their games, however, developers have greatly reduced the cost of marketing a game and eliminated many of the risks involved with distribution. Online, unburdened by storage and deployment costs, developers have the ability to make on-the-fly changes and take creative risks that wouldn\u2019t be possible if the game was being sold on a shelf. \u201cThis lowered the barrier to entry for people who wanted to develop games, and we continue to see developers come to the PC to create things that are more difficult on other platforms,\u201d says Piscatella. That\u2019s led to the welcome arrival of more independent studios, and, for consumers, the presence of niche titles at competitive prices.\u201cThere are also more distribution channels on the digital side of PC gaming, which gives consumers more options to discover and purchase content \u2014 sometimes with promotional programs that are more appealing than what can be found on other platforms,\u201d Piscatella adds.Long-term, he says, PC players enjoy lower costs than gamers on other platforms because they\u2019re able to access many games online at little to no cost.\u201cYou can pick up League of Legends and play for free forever if you want,\u201d Piscatella says. \nEsports is another trend galvanizing casual players to broaden their playing and consumption habits. No longer a group of niche gamers, the esports community now includes nearly 145 million fans from across the gaming spectrum, according to Bryan de Zayas, director, Dell Gaming. Professional competitors now have their own leagues and high-stakes competitions. Fans are able to watch them compete on numerous streaming services and major TV networks.Analyst Peddie says the dynamism of esports has made PC gaming more attractive for players who might not have always considered themselves hardcore gamers. Now, he says, players can more easily follow their favorite gamers and emulate their habits.\u201cEsports has been a major contributor to the growth of the PC gaming market because it has exposed more people to the PC as a gaming platform,\u201d he says. \u201cPC gaming is more meaningful to players because they can relate to it.\u201d\u201cThat has caused people to step up and get in the game.\u201dPC gamers are also saving money on hardware. While high-end gaming PCs have typically been expensive, new models, such as the Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming, are easing the way to PC ownership by offering low-price computers that combine leading gaming technologies with helpful software for users\u2019 personal and professional lives. Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming users can enjoy free, pre-installed access to Adobe, Microsoft Office and Dropbox, for example.\nOf course, a gaming computer also needs top-of-the-line specs, and the new Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming delivers. The PC shares technology and developments from Dell\u2019s Alienware professional gaming line, offering gamers jaw-dropping performance and graphics that have previously been present only in more-expensive machines. With an Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i7 quad-core processor and a NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae GTX 1060 discrete GPU, the new Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming gives players the most power and performance for their money.Illustration by Nicolas M\u00e9nardThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "A.I. Researchers Leave Elon Musk Lab to Begin Robotics Start-Up", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEMERYVILLE, Calif. \u2014 During a recent speech at the University of California, Berkeley, Pieter Abbeel played a video clip of a robot doing housework.The trick was that an engineer was operating the robot from afar, dictating its every move. But as Mr. Abbeel explained, the video showed that robotic hardware was nimble enough to mimic complex human behavior. It just needed software that could guide the hardware \u2014 without the help of that engineer.\u201cThis is largely a computer science problem \u2014 an artificial intelligence problem,\u201d Mr. Abbeel said. \u201cWe have the hardware that can do the job.\u201dTheir start-up, Embodied Intelligence, is backed by $7 million in funding from the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Amplify Partners and other investors. The company will specialize in complex algorithms that allow machines to learn tasks on their own. Using these methods, existing robots could learn to, for example, install car parts that aren\u2019t quite like the parts they have installed in the past, sort through a bucket of random holiday gifts as they arrive at a warehouse, or perform other tasks that machines traditionally could not.\u201cWe now have teachable robots,\u201d Mr. Abbeel said during a recent interview at the new company\u2019s offices in Emeryville, Calif., just across the bay from San Francisco.Robots already automate some work inside factories and warehouses, such as moving boxes from place to place at Amazon\u2019s massive distribution centers. But companies must program these machines for each particular task, limiting their possible applications. The hope is that robots can master a much wider array of tasks by learning on their own.\u201cToday, every motion that an industrial robot makes is specified down to the millimeter,\u201d said Sunil Dhaliwal, the Amplify founder who led the firm\u2019s investment in Embodied Intelligence. \u201cBut most real problems can\u2019t be solved that way. You have to be able not just to tell the robot what to do, but to tell it how to learn.\u201dMuch like Google and labs at Brown and Northeastern University, Embodied Intelligence is also augmenting these methods with a wide range of other machine learning techniques. Most notably, the start-up is exploring what is called imitation learning, a way for machines to learn discrete tasks from human demonstrations.The company is using this method to teach a two-armed robot to pick up plastic pipes from a table. Donning virtual reality headsets and holding motion trackers in their hands, Mr. Abbeel and his colleagues will repeatedly demonstrate the task in a digital world that recreates what is in front of a robot. Then the machine can then learn from this digital data.\u201cWe collect data on what the human is doing,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cThen we can train the machine to imitate the human.\u201dThese and similar machine learning methods have only begun to bear fruit over the past few years, but many believe they will overhaul the field of robotics. It is telling that OpenAI, a pure research lab that opened its doors less than two years ago, has now lost two big names to more commercial pursuits.Poached away from OpenAI by Mr. Musk himself, the machine learning expert Andrej Karpathy is now the director of A.I. at Tesla, working to help autonomous cars get smarter faster. And Mr. Abbeel is launching Embodied Intelligence. \u201cAndrej is stepping out of the research mode and saying: \u2018I want to do this in practice,\u2019\u201d Mr. Abbeel explained. \u201cThat same thing goes for us.\u201dHe said he believed his new start-up can rapidly push its methods into manufacturing operations like the auto industry. Although robotics already handle many tasks inside such factories, there are many others they can\u2019t yet master. That is what Embodied Intelligence hopes to change.Some researchers question how much these machine learning techniques will ultimately improve robotics, believing they are overhyped among both researchers and the news media. \u201cMachine learning is being thrown at so many problems in robotics,\u201d said Robert Howe, a professor of robotics at Harvard University. \u201cAnd it produces just enough results that people can trumpet it.\u201dBut Mr. Abbeel is among the world\u2019s top researchers in his field, and his decision to start a own company is an indication that machine learning will continue to push robotics forward.\u201cIt is obvious that this is what you need to build flexible, agile robotics,\u201d said Geoff Hinton, a pioneer of machine learning.Follow Cade Metz on Twiiter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}

No.", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixIt happens every year: Apple releases new iPhones, and then hordes of people groan about their older iPhones slowing to a crawl.The phenomenon of perceived slowdowns is so widespread that many believe tech companies intentionally cripple smartphones and computers to ensure that people buy new ones every few years. Conspiracy theorists call it planned obsolescence.That\u2019s a myth. While slowdowns happen, they take place for a far less nefarious reason. That reason is a software upgrade.\u201cThere\u2019s no incentive for operating system companies to create planned obsolescence,\u201d said Greg Raiz, a former program manager for Microsoft who worked on Windows XP. \u201cIt\u2019s software, and software has various degrees of production bugs and unintended things that happen.\u201dThe technical process of upgrading from an old operating system to a new one \u2014 migrating your files, apps and settings along the way \u2014 is extremely complicated. So when you install a brand-new operating system on an older device, problems may occur that make everything from opening the camera to browsing the web feel sluggish.The good news is that because tech companies are not intentionally neutering your devices, there are remedies for when you think your three-year-old iPhone or your seven-year-old Windows computer has become slow or short-lived. Here\u2019s a guide to speeding up your troubled gadgets, based on interviews with information technology professionals and operating system experts.Tech companies make it simple to upgrade to a new operating system by pressing an \u201cupdate\u201d button, which seamlessly migrates all your apps and data over. While that\u2019s convenient, it isn\u2019t the best way to ensure that things will continue running smoothly.A better practice is backing up all your data and purging everything from the device before installing the new operating system. This \u201cclean install\u201d works more reliably because the engineers developing operating systems were able to test this condition more easily, Mr. Raiz said.Let\u2019s say, for example, you have an iPhone 6 with 100 apps installed, four email accounts and 2,000 photos. It is more likely that a quality-assurance engineer tested installing a new operating system on a blank iPhone 6, rather than an iPhone 6 with the same setup as yours.Sometimes you can do some light maintenance to speed up your device. Over the long term, an operating system accumulates system files, settings, logs and other data; I.T. experts call this \u201ccruft.\u201d This can bog down your device.Here\u2019s something many people don\u2019t realize: Just because your iPhone or Samsung phone has 64 gigabytes of storage doesn\u2019t mean you should fill it all the way up. The device will generally run faster if more of its storage is available.That\u2019s partly because your device needs space to move data around and download software updates. But it\u2019s also related to how the storage technology works inside smartphones and modern laptops.Smartphones and newer laptops rely on flash storage, which stores data in the cells of semiconductor chips. When data is stored on a flash drive, it is scattered across the drive. So when you are pulling data to open an app or a document, you are retrieving it from multiple parts of the drive. If lots of space is occupied, the data gets crowded and the device may feel sluggish.\u201cIf you fill these things up, it doesn\u2019t get to operate as well,\u201d said Brian Denslow, a technician for TechCollective, an information technology consulting company in San Francisco. Mr. Denslow said a good rule of thumb is to buy more storage than you think you will use. If you think you are going to use 64 gigabytes on an iPad, for example, buy the 256-gigabyte model.Your device may seem slower for reasons unrelated to the device. Mr. Denslow, the technician, said many apps relied on an internet connection, so a shoddy Wi-Fi router might be the real bottleneck.\u201cInstead of spending $1,000 on a phone every year, spend $500 on networking,\u201d Mr. Denslow said. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy, but it provides more benefits over a long period of time.\u201dAt the end of the day, there are many reasons your device may feel slow. New operating systems carry more powerful features that were designed to work better on new devices. In addition, developers of third-party apps typically prioritize making software for newer handsets, and sometimes they even discontinue support for old gadgets. If there are important tasks that your older device cannot do proficiently, consider an upgrade.Mr. Raiz, the former Microsoft program manager, said he had recently encountered problems after updating his iPhone 6S to iOS 11. Some functions, like the ability to search for an app, no longer worked. Resetting the device\u2019s settings fixed the problem, but he said he would most likely buy a new iPhone soon anyway to keep up with the latest technologies.\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can do if your device is multiple release cycles behind,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Business Titans, Pop Stars and Royals Hide Their Wealth", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "The Paradise PapersRecords from an offshore hideaway show how an American billionaire grew one of the world\u2019s largest trusts and another owned part of a company accused of exploiting the poor.Supported byJames H. Simons, a reserved mathematician and hedge fund operator from Boston now approaching 80, is a big Democratic donor. Warren A. Stephens, a 60-year-old golf enthusiast once called the king of Little Rock, Ark., inherited a family investment bank and became a booster of conservative Republicans.But Mr. Simons and Mr. Stephens are both billionaires who have used the services of offshore finance \u2014 the trusts and shell companies that the world\u2019s wealthiest people use to park their money beyond the reach of tax collectors and out of the public eye.Mr. Simons was the main beneficiary of a private trust, never previously described, that was one of the largest in the world. In response to recent questions about the trust, Mr. Simons said that he had transferred his share to a Bermuda-registered charitable foundation.Mr. Stephens used an opaque holding company to own an approximately 40 percent stake in a loan business accused by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of cheating working-class and poor Americans. While earning millions from the investment, Mr. Stephens helped finance a political onslaught against the bureau, never mentioning his personal connection to the fight.Appleby operates in a rarefied universe of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, where yachts and private jets are preferred transport and mansions sit empty because their owner has several others. Some of Appleby\u2019s customers are also P.E.P.\u2019s \u2014 politically exposed persons \u2014 for whom avoiding unwanted attention is a crucial goal.\u201cThe Right People. The Right Places,\u201d reads the slogan on Appleby\u2019s stationery.Appleby board minutes contain lists of \u201cdeclined business,\u201d including government officials suspected of corruption and millionaires linked to organized crime.Still, some dubious clients slip through. A PowerPoint slide used by Appleby\u2019s head of compliance discusses terrorist financing and refers to funds that were \u201cdefinitely tainted.\u201d\u201cSome of the crap we accept is amazing totally amazing,\u201d say notes to a slide about sizing up potential customers.Even with some potential customers turned away, business has rarely been better. The ranks of the superrich are growing fast, fueled by legitimate fortunes in finance, trade and technology \u2014 as well as drugs, embezzlement and bribery. And the offshore finance industry has grown alongside its customers\u2019 accounts.A 2015 Appleby publication written for such clients, \u201cWealth Structuring 20:20,\u201d features photos of a handsome couple and their children hurrying to board a sleek personal jet. \u201cWealth seeks out safe harbours,\u201d one article is titled. Another advises on \u201cMotivating children of means.\u201dIn emails, Appleby employees fret about how to pamper well-heeled clients.\u201cOur fees are around 40k and they are the sort of people who I think would appreciate popping a bottle on closing at Appleby this afternoon,\u201d a lawyer in the firm\u2019s Grand Cayman office wrote in 2008 of a particular deal. \u201cDo you have the key to the booze vault? It would need to be decent stuff as they\u2019ll know their champagne.\u201dAppleby had 31,000 American clients, the most common nationality by far. The firm\u2019s files include a who\u2019s who of the nation\u2019s wealthiest citizens: prominent Democrats like George Soros, the financier and philanthropist, and Penny Pritzker, commerce secretary in the Obama administration; and high-profile Republican supporters of President Trump, including Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate, and Carl Icahn, the private equity investor.Queen Elizabeth II, according to Appleby documents, used a Cayman Islands fund to invest in a company that owned a share of a British rent-to-own company widely criticized for financing the sale of household items at interest rates as high as 99.9 percent. The leaked files reveal Madonna\u2019s shares in a medical supplies firm, Bono\u2019s investment in a Lithuanian shopping center and the Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen\u2019s yacht and submarines.Around the globe, the documents disclose the holdings of rulers and politicians. The list includes three former prime ministers of Canada, the queen dowager of Jordan and at least five members of the Qatari ruling family.Founded in 1898 by a British officer, Maj. Reginald Appleby \u2014 an avowed opponent of taxation \u2014 Appleby now has offices in nearly all the world\u2019s tax havens: Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Hong Kong, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Mauritius, the Seychelles and Shanghai.Such locations offer low or zero tax rates, companies consisting only of a postbox, and accountants and lawyers skilled at hiding money.In a statement, Appleby said the firm had done nothing wrong. \u201cWe are an offshore law firm who advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe do not tolerate illegal behaviour.\u201dIn recent years, billionaires\u2019 fortunes have grown by an average of 7 to 8 percent a year, while total wealth has grown at just 3 percent annually, said Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Globalization, deregulation and declining taxes have all been factors.\u201cThe other important thing is the rise of the global, cross-border wealth management industry,\u201d including Appleby, Mr. Zucman said.The richest 1 percent of the world\u2019s population now owns more than half of global wealth, and the top 10 percent owns about 90 percent.\u201cThe data suggests that most of the gains at the top are coming at the expense of the rest of the population,\u201d Mr. Zucman said. That conclusion is shared by many other scholars.The wealthy use the power that accompanies their money, he said, to exert political influence, reduce taxes and regulation \u2014 and hire experts to keep their money safe.Mr. Simons, the hedge fund billionaire, was a young math professor in 1974 when a Colombian friend established a trust in Bermuda on his behalf using a gift of $100,000 to him, his parents and his descendants. American tax authorities would consider the Lord Jim Trust, as it was named, a foreign entity, limiting the visibility of the Internal Revenue Service into its holdings and its ability to tax its funds until it made distributions to the Simons family. (Appleby did not create the trust but later provided legal advice.)In 1982, Mr. Simons founded Renaissance Technologies, a New York-based hedge fund whose secret trading algorithms soon generated rates of return that became storied on Wall Street. Over the next three decades, Renaissance became one of the most lucrative hedge funds on the planet, making Mr. Simons a billionaire many times over.Mr. Simons, in response to questions, said that when he and his family received distributions from the Bermuda trust, they were reported to the I.R.S. But Mr. Simons said he and his relatives took out only limited amounts, mainly in the early years of the trust, whose main investments were Renaissance funds that enjoyed spectacular returns.As Renaissance\u2019s investments grew, so did its footprint in American life. Mr. Simons became one of the country\u2019s top political donors. During the last election cycle, he was the sixth-largest contributor to political candidates and causes, giving more than $26 million, nearly all to Democrats, including $11 million to Priorities USA Action, a political action committee supporting Hillary Clinton.Mr. Simons\u2019s business partner and Renaissance\u2019s departing co-chief executive, Robert Mercer, rose to the highest ranks of Republican donors and became an influential backer of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, contributing more than $3 million. A major funder of Breitbart News, Mr. Mercer influenced critical decisions of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, such as the hiring of Stephen K. Bannon, then Breitbart\u2019s executive chairman, as the campaign\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Mercer has also been an Appleby client.As the tax dispute has proceeded, Mr. Simons is now estimated to be the 25th-richest person in the United States, with a net worth estimated at $18.5 billion, according to the Forbes list of richest Americans. But such rankings, important yardsticks in the study of global development and inequality, often rely on incomplete public data.Mr. Simons\u2019s Lord Jim Trust offers one example. Though the trust has been listed in various filings, a 2010 document in Appleby\u2019s files provides details for the first time. If it had been fully accounted for in calculating his net worth, he would have vaulted even higher in the ranks of the superrich.\u201cSo far it has not been very active,\u201d Mr. Simons wrote in a response to questions from The Times. \u201cIn future years, as my income decreases and ultimately ceases, SFI will play an increasingly larger role in funding.\u201dBut the Simons Foundation International operates in obscurity. Though it would easily rank in the top 10 foundations in the United States, it has no website.Mr. Simons said that keeping the foundation in Bermuda made it easier to give to charities that weren\u2019t American and also avoided the minimal annual giving requirements that foundations must follow in the United States.Ray D. Madoff, a professor of law at Boston College who focuses on philanthropies and taxes, said that in terms of oversight and transparency, \u201cthe first sin was whatever it was that allowed however many billions of dollars of a U.S. citizen to be growing tax free in Bermuda.\u201dBut Michael G. Pfeifer, a Washington lawyer who specializes in estate planning for wealthy people and helped write the tax rules governing overseas trusts, said that Mr. Simons merely followed the rules.\u201cI would have told the guy, \u2018You\u2019ve got this money offshore \u2014 just leave it offshore,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pfeifer said. \u201cAnd he did.\u201dIf Mr. Simons\u2019s motive for setting up offshore entities is complex, Mr. Stephens\u2019s seems more obvious.In late 2011, representatives of Mr. Stephens and his business partner, James R. Carnes, asked Appleby to incorporate two offshore companies as part of a plan to help Native American tribes set up lending operations, a common business tactic because such ventures can claim tribal immunity against outside legal challenges.The new venture\u2019s parent company, Hayfield Investment Partners, was incorporated in Delaware \u2014 considered a tax haven like a half-dozen other American states, underscoring that secrecy and tax advantages are not limited to palm-dotted tropical islands. Hayfield already had a separate subsidiary called Integrity Advance, an online payday loan company whose lending practices were coming into the cross hairs of regulators across the United States.Documents in Appleby\u2019s files show that Mr. Stephens and his funds owned 40 percent of Hayfield, which received additional investments from executives of Stephens Inc., the family investment bank, and acquaintances like the golf star Phil Mickelson, who contributed $12,000.It did not take long for Integrity Advance to generate complaints from borrowers and regulators. People short of cash who took out small loans would later see large withdrawals from their bank accounts for interest and services fees that often far exceeded the amount they originally borrowed.By November 2012, Integrity Advance had received cease-and-desist letters from state regulators in Connecticut, Kentucky, Illinois, Mississippi and South Carolina. In May 2013, a Minnesota district court ordered the company to pay nearly $8 million in civil penalties and victim restitution, saying that the firm had targeted financially vulnerable citizens with interest rates as high as 1,369 percent.One borrower, Nils Paul Warren, a broadcast audio technician for Nascar in Orlando, complained to Florida regulators that he\u2019d had to shell out more than $1,300 to repay a short-term $500 online loan he got from Integrity Advance in 2009 \u2014 a sum far greater than what he had expected.\u201cI think the bulk of their clientele are people who are a paycheck away from being homeless,\u201d Mr. Warren said in an interview.As complaints mounted, Mr. Stephens and Mr. Carnes sold part of Integrity Advance to a pawnshop-style loan company, Ezcorp. Eventually the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused Integrity Advance of \u201cfalse and deceptive\u201d tactics, and last year, an administrative law judge recommended to the head of the bureau that the company and Mr. Carnes, its chief executive, pay more than $51 million in fines and restitution to borrowers. Integrity Advance and Mr. Carnes are appealing the ruling.In its legal action against Integrity Advance, the bureau emphasized Mr. Carnes\u2019s 52 percent ownership of Hayfield, the parent company. Neither regulators nor the news media has ever mentioned Mr. Stephens\u2019s sizable stake. (Mr. Stephens declined to comment.)If he kept quiet about his role in the embattled payday loan business, he showed no similar reticence in attacking the consumer bureau. In June 2013, he told The Wall Street Journal that the bureau bore some blame for lagging business growth. \u201cThe stories we hear about that are pretty scary,\u201d the billionaire said.During last year\u2019s campaign, Mr. Stephens contributed $3 million to Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee that has pushed Congress to strip the bureau\u2019s enforcement powers.Along with helping bankroll such Washington battles, Mr. Stephens has recently used his investment bank, Stephens Inc., to start an online video series called \u201cThis Is Capitalism\u201d to improve millennials\u2019 opinion of free-market economics.Spencer Woodman is a reporter for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

{"Headline": "The Upside of Being Ruled by the Five Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. But what if that\u2019s not so bad?For a year and a half \u2014 and more urgently for much of the last month \u2014 I have warned of the growing economic, social and political power held by the five largest American tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.That\u2019s not ridiculous. Over the last few weeks, several scholars said there are good reasons to be sanguine about our new tech overlords. Below, I compiled their best arguments about the bright side of the Five.Tech is inherently messy. The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them. This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow. The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo \u2014 and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides.One benefit of having five giant companies in charge of today\u2019s tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems.Consider Russian propaganda. People have worried about the internet\u2019s capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades \u2014 from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism \u2014 the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation. But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies \u2014 one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs \u2014 it was never conceivable to limit that era\u2019s equivalent of fake news.Today, it suddenly is. Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control.This does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates \u2014 and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression. But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms.\u201cThis is new stuff everybody is dealing with \u2014 it\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of \u201cBig Is Beautiful,\u201d a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies. (The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.) \u201cSo when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier. You\u2019ve got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor.\u201dOver the last few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome \u2014 so why was I including their company in that group?This dynamic \u2014 where each company competes mightily against the others \u2014 suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d with Mr. Atkinson. \u201cAs long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then what\u2019s to complain about?\u201dYou can see this in their product road maps. None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control \u2014 for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop.At the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies. And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways \u2014 with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics.\u201cSo, why pre-emptively say that maybe we\u2019ll be harmed in the future \u2014 that in 2030 they\u2019ll jack up their prices or something?\u201d Mr. Lind asked. \u201cWell, deal with that as it comes.\u201dThe Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale. Thanks to economic dynamics like network effects \u2014 where a product, like Facebook, gets more useful as more people use it \u2014 it was perhaps inevitable that we would see the rise of a handful of large companies take control of much of the modern tech business.I don\u2019t mean this list to get the Five off the hook. How we deal with their efforts to capture more power over the economy and our society is perhaps the next great question facing America. But this is a complex problem precisely because there are both advantages and disadvantages to their size.As I said, tech is messy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Disappearing American Grad Student", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are two very different pictures of the students roaming the hallways and labs at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering.At the undergraduate level, 80 percent are United States residents. At the graduate level, the number is reversed: About 80 percent hail from India, China, Korea, Turkey and other foreign countries.For graduate students far from home, the swirl of cultures is both reassuring and invigorating. \u201cYou\u2019re comfortable everyone is going through the same struggles and journeys as you are,\u201d said Vibhati Joshi of Mumbai, India, who\u2019s in her final semester for a master\u2019s degree in financial engineering. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201dIn arts and humanities, the figure was about 16 percent; in business, a little more than 18 percent.Many factors contribute to the gap, but a major one is the booming job market in technology. For the most part, Americans don\u2019t see the need for an advanced degree when there are so many professional opportunities waiting for them. For some, the price is just too high when they have so much student debt already.\u201cYou can believe that U.S. bachelor\u2019s students, if they\u2019re good, can go get a job at Microsoft or Google with a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d said Edward D. Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington.Universities and employers are eager to tap the pool of international talent that helps them stay competitive globally, and graduate programs have a financial incentive in attracting them: Demand from abroad is so high, administrators don\u2019t see a need to offer as much tuition assistance.The Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, for example, saw a 30 percent decrease in international applications to its professional master\u2019s program for this semester, according to the dean, Joseph J. Helble. Dr. Helble surveyed more than two dozen engineering deans earlier this year, and three quarters of them said they, too, had seen significant drops in international graduate applications. But enrollment, he said, was not off.Still, trends are not clear.\u201cIf there are one or two more years of comparable 20 to 30 percent decreases in international applications, we\u2019re very concerned about our ability to conduct research and spin off and start companies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned from a competitive perspective.\u201dDan Spaulding, who oversees human resources at Zillow Group, the online real estate company, said that in specialized areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence, his company favors graduate degrees, but for the vast majority of its technical jobs, a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science is adequate. He said he has heard concerns from students and managers about an international chill, but for now the supply of students with computer science skills hasn\u2019t been affected.\u201cA great many of them are coming in with programming skills first and looking to radiate out into other business disciplines, product management, product design,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think going deep academically is not a priority for as many computer science students today.\u201dIn 1994, only about 40 percent of students who were enrolled in computer science Ph.D. programs were from outside the country, according to the Computing Research Association survey.As the economy improved, the percentage of Americans in graduate programs dropped. \u201cGoing to grad school became less of a priority for so many students,\u201d said Stuart Zweben, co-author of the survey and professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University. \u201cYou had to really be interested in research or something special.\u201dThe balance of computer science graduate programs began to tilt toward so-called nonresident aliens in the late 1990s, when well-capitalized dot-coms began scouring for programmers, sometimes encouraging summer interns to drop out of school, Dr. Zweben said.Students from other countries have long seen graduate school as their best path to employment and residency in the United States, and for the industry connections they are not likely to find in their home countries.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to get access from here,\u201d said Ms. Joshi, who is president of the N.Y.U. finance club. She wanted to attend N.Y.U. so she could merge her background in information technology with her interest in the financial industry. She has regular exposure to industry speakers and recruiters.And he would like to see more of them enrolled in the graduate programs. \u201cI feel that\u2019s an imbalance,\u201d he said, \u201cthat absolutely needs to be corrected.\u201dNick Wingfield is a technology correspondent at The Times based in Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft to Expand Campus, as Amazon Looks Elsewhere", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetThe project, which Microsoft plans to announce at its annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday, amounts to a major overhaul of the company\u2019s 500-acre campus in Redmond, Wash., the leafy Seattle suburb that it has called home since 1986.Amazon said it received 238 bids from across North America and is whittling down the list to a group of finalists, with a winner to be announced next year.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said the company did not intend for its hometown expansion \u2014 which he described as a multibillion-dollar investment \u2014 as a comment on Amazon. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re out to make a statement about what anyone else is doing or not doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is the right decision for us.\u201dStill, Mr. Smith could not resist a slight dig. \u201cWhen it comes to headquarters, one is enough, we feel,\u201d he said.Today Microsoft\u2019s Redmond campus has most of the trappings found at the sprawling headquarters of tech giants in Silicon Valley \u2014 the soccer fields, manicured lawns and oceans of parking lots. That will not change on its renovated campus, but Microsoft is taking a different approach in other respects.The new buildings will be clustered closer together. They will also be taller \u2014 four stories instead of the two or three that are common now. There will be a new underground parking facility, a 2-acre open plaza that will serve as a central gathering place and new walking and cycling trails.\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to build a somewhat denser campus and create a somewhat more urban feel,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The company\u2019s decision to stay put at its Redmond campus flies in the face of a trend among technology companies to gravitate closer to cities. The abundance of amenities, night life and public transportation in urban areas has led to thriving tech scenes in San Francisco, New York and other cities.\u201cMy gut reaction is, \u2018Wow, they seem kind of out of touch,\u2019\u201d said Dan Bertolet, a researcher at Sightline Institute, a nonprofit in Seattle focused on sustainability. \u201cAll the young people I know who work in the tech industry out there want to be in Seattle. They pooh-pooh places like Redmond.\u201dTech companies are also finding that the talent they are after increasingly wants to live in cities, not suburbs. That has led suburban giants like Google, Facebook and Apple to operate large private bus services to ferry workers to their headquarters. Microsoft\u2019s own bus service has more than 94 buses and over 4,000 daily riders.But those buses also frequently sit in soul-crushing traffic. Possible relief for Microsoft\u2019s commuters will come in the form of light-rail that will connect it to Seattle. A light-rail station on Microsoft\u2019s campus is scheduled to open by 2023.Had Microsoft decided to move to Seattle rather than remain in the suburbs, the company would likely have faced severe criticism from affordability advocates, who are worried about lower income residents getting pushed out of the city.Mr. Bertolet said suburban areas outside Seattle tend to restrict the density of housing so they\u2019re not likely to develop an urban atmosphere without significant change. \u201cMaybe in the long term,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s better to have a regional network of bigger cities, but getting there will be rough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poised for West Coast Dominance, Democrats Eye Grand Agenda", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAMMAMISH, Wash. \u2014 It is the stuff of liberal fantasies: a vast, defiant territory, sweeping along the country\u2019s Pacific coastline, governed by Democrats and resisting President Trump at every turn.Sharon Nelson, the Democratic leader in the Washington State Senate, conveyed the party\u2019s grand aspirations in an almost Trump-like phrase: \u201cA blue wall,\u201d Ms. Nelson enthused, \u201cfrom the Canadian border to the Mexican border.\u201dLeading in the polls and anticipating victory, Democrats have sketched an aggressive agenda on issues where strong consensus appears to exist in the party, including new laws on gun control, contraception and environmental regulation. Ms. Nelson said she had met with the speaker of the Oregon Statehouse about enacting policy across state lines. The three states\u2019 Democratic governors have spoken regularly about policy collaboration, and over the summer began coordinated talks on climate change with foreign heads of state.\u201cWe intend to make a full-scale effort in the next session of the Legislature if we win,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a bell in the night, showing hope for the country, rejecting the Trump agenda of denying climate science.\u201d\u201cThe more we can have uniformity in a carbon pricing system or regulatory system, the better,\u201d he said.Both parties see Democrats as favored to win the district, which voted heavily for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Republicans held the area\u2019s State Senate seat largely because of the personal popularity of an incumbent lawmaker, Andy Hill, who died of lung cancer last fall.Despite their dominance at the federal level and in most state capitals, West Coast Republicans have been driven to the point of extinction as the party\u2019s standing has plummeted in prosperous cities and suburbs, from San Diego to Seattle. Their candidate in the State Senate race, Jinyoung Lee Englund, a polished former political operative, has strained to set herself apart from the national party, declaring that she did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 and pleading with voters to embrace divided government in Olympia.Ms. Englund, 33, has campaigned explicitly against the \u201cblue wall\u201d scenario, warning that voters should not let Washington \u201cgo the way of California\u201d and other one-party states. She expressed deep skepticism of Mr. Inslee\u2019s climate proposals and suggested Democrats were mainly focused on trying to raise general revenue by another name. Republican groups have aired commercials saying that \u201cSeattle liberals\u201d could wreak havoc on the state\u2019s finances if Democrats are allowed to govern unchecked.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go the way of Oregon,\u201d Ms. Englund said in an interview. \u201cWashingtonians are more independent.\u201dMs. Englund rebuked Democrats for what she characterized as using the state government as a partisan bludgeon. \u201cI think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThe role of a state senator is not to go and lambaste what\u2019s happening nationally.\u201dMs. Dhingra, 43, a gregarious career prosecutor, has pledged support for an array of Democratic wish-list policies \u2014 though in a nod to the district\u2019s moderate history, her campaign literature promises \u201cindependent leadership.\u201d She has endorsed a carbon tax and applauded the state\u2019s insistent litigation against the White House. Ms. Dhingra said in an interview that state government should take comprehensive action to check \u201cwhat\u2019s coming out of Washington, D.C.\u201d\u201cFrankly, I think all states are going to have to do that,\u201d Ms. Dhingra said. \u201cWe have to make sure immigrants feel safe. We have to make sure women\u2019s health care is protected.\u201dRepublican leaders in the state concede the national backdrop has made a tough race even harder. Rob McKenna, a former state attorney general who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Inslee in 2012, said an upset is possible but called the \u201cTrump factor\u201d a drag on Ms. Englund.Mr. McKenna cautioned that even a Democratic victory should not be overinterpreted as a political turning point. A setback for Republicans, he said, would not change the fundamental character of the state, which he described as more politically competitive and fiscally conservative than its coastal neighbors.\u201cThis is a state that is still, more or less, 50-50,\u201d Mr. McKenna said, predicting of Democrats: \u201cThey\u2019ll have difficulties, because they\u2019ll be reluctant to risk their majorities in the House and the Senate.\u201dOther local leaders are less sure, holding up the Seattle area as an illustrative example of an upwardly mobile metropolitan area shifting to the left. If Republicans have staked their message, in large part, on suburban distrust of the big city, the region is increasingly knitted together by a thriving tech economy at companies like Amazon and Microsoft, and an expanding rapid transit rail network that is tying people closer to Seattle.\u201cThe comical attempts to demonize Seattle in the 45th District race, I think, will be shown to have been a poor strategy,\u201d Mr. Constantine said.The area\u2019s shifting identity has been on vivid display in this election: As Ms. Dhingra went door to door on Wednesday in Duvall, a growing outer suburb built across rolling farmlands, some voters sounded eager to repudiate Republicans. Patty Andrus, a retired paraprofessional in the field of special education, described Ms. Dhingra\u2019s campaign as a corrective to Mr. Trump\u2019s election.With a Democratic takeover in Washington State, she said, \u201cI would stand up taller.\u201dEven some Republican-leaning voters who back Ms. Englund say they are uneasy about Mr. Trump. \u201cShe seems sensible and levelheaded,\u201d Ed Whitehead, the retired owner of a printing company, said of Ms. Englund after she stopped at his door in Sammamish.Mr. Whitehead, who said he voted for Mr. Trump, said these days he is \u201cnot so sure\u201d about the president.Ms. Dhingra suggested that the session might become mainly a chance for Democrats to prove themselves responsible, rather than as a lunge toward California-like status. The Democratic caucus, she noted, is not homogeneous: \u201cYou have rural-area Democrats who have different priorities.\u201dMr. Inslee, too, said Democrats should temper their expectations, even as he made plain his excitement about governing with a freer hand.\u201cThere\u2019s diversity of views in all caucuses, and so nothing\u2019s guaranteed in life,\u201d Mr. Inslee said. \u201cBut what this does is, it takes the shackles off the doors.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the name of a city in Washington where Manka Dhingra canvassed.

{"Headline": "Yale Professors Race Google and IBM to the First Quantum Computer", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Robert Schoelkopf is at the forefront of a worldwide effort to build the world\u2019s first quantum computer. Such a machine, if it can be built, would use the seemingly magical principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems today\u2019s computers never could.Three giants of the tech world \u2014 Google, IBM, and Intel \u2014 are using a method pioneered by Mr. Schoelkopf, a Yale University professor, and a handful of other physicists as they race to build a machine that could significantly accelerate everything from drug discovery to artificial intelligence. So does a Silicon Valley start-up called Rigetti Computing. And though it has remained under the radar until now, those four quantum projects have another notable competitor: Robert Schoelkopf.After their research helped fuel the work of so many others, Mr. Schoelkopf and two other Yale professors have started their own quantum computing company, Quantum Circuits.Based just down the road from Yale in New Haven, Conn., and backed by $18 million in funding from the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and others, the start-up is another sign that quantum computing \u2014 for decades a distant dream of the world\u2019s computer scientists \u2014 is edging closer to reality.\u201cIn the last few years, it has become apparent to us and others around the world that we know enough about this that we can build a working system,\u201d Mr. Schoelkopf said. \u201cThis is a technology that we can begin to commercialize.\u201dQuantum computing systems are difficult to understand because they do not behave like the everyday world we live in. But this counterintuitive behavior is what allows them to perform calculations at rate that would not be possible on a typical computer.Today\u2019s computers store information as \u201cbits,\u201d with each transistor holding either a 1 or a 0. But thanks to something called the superposition principle \u2014 behavior exhibited by subatomic particles like electrons and photons, the fundamental particles of light \u2014 a quantum bit, or \u201cqubit,\u201d can store a 1 and a 0 at the same time. This means two qubits can hold four values at once. As you expand the number of qubits, the machine becomes exponentially more powerful.The trouble is that storing information in a quantum system for more than a short amount of time is very difficult, and this short \u201ccoherence time\u201d leads to errors in calculations. But over the past two decades, Mr. Schoelkopf and other physicists have worked to solve this problem using what are called superconducting circuits. They have built qubits from materials that exhibit quantum properties when cooled to extremely low temperatures.\u201cSchoelkopf\u2019s Law started as a joke, but now we use it in many of our research papers,\u201d said Isaac Chuang, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cNo one expected this would be possible, but the improvement has been exponential.\u201dThese superconducting circuits have become the primary area of quantum computing research across the industry. One of Mr. Schoelkopf\u2019s former students now leads the quantum computing program at IBM. The founder of Rigetti Computing studied with Michel Devoret, one of the other Yale professors behind Quantum Circuits.In recent months, after grabbing a team of top researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, Google indicated it is on the verge of using this method to build a machine that can achieve \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d \u2014 when a quantum machine performs a task that would be impossible on your laptop or any other machine that obeys the laws of classical physics.The belief is that quantum machines will eventually analyze the interactions between physical molecules with a precision that is not possible today, something that could radically accelerate the development of new medications. Google and others also believe that these systems can significantly accelerate machine learning, the field of teaching computers to learn tasks on their own by analyzing data or experiments with certain behavior.A quantum computer could also be able to break the encryption algorithms that guard the world\u2019s most sensitive corporate and government data. With so much at stake, it is no surprise that so many companies are betting on this technology, including start-ups like Quantum Circuits.The deck is stacked against the smaller players, because the big-name companies have so much more money to throw at the problem. But start-ups have their own advantages, even in such a complex and expensive area of research.\u201cSmall teams of exceptional people can do exceptional things,\u201d said Bill Coughran, who helped oversee the creation of Google\u2019s vast internet infrastructure and is now investing in Mr. Schoelkopf\u2019s company as a partner at Sequoia. \u201cI have yet to see large teams inside big companies doing anything tremendously innovative.\u201dThough Quantum Circuits is using the same quantum method as its bigger competitors, Mr. Schoelkopf argued that his company has an edge because it is tackling the problem differently. Rather than building one large quantum machine, it is constructing a series of tiny machines that can be networked together. He said this will make it easier to correct errors in quantum calculations \u2014 one of the main difficulties in building one of these complex machines.But each of the big companies insist that they hold an advantage \u2014 and each is loudly trumpeting its progress, even if a working machine is still years away.Mr. Coughran said that he and Sequoia envision Quantum Circuits evolving into a company that can deliver quantum computing to any business or researcher that needs it. Another investor, Canaan\u2019s Brendan Dickinson, said that if a company like this develops a viable quantum machine, it will become a prime acquisition target.\u201cThe promise of a large quantum computer is incredibly powerful,\u201d Mr. Dickinson said. \u201cIt will solve problems we can\u2019t even imagine right now.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of one of the investors in Quantum Circuits.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Technology Ambitions Could Upset the Global Trade Order", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 When President Trump arrives in Beijing on Wednesday, he will most likely complain about traditional areas of dispute like steel and cars. But Washington officials and major global companies increasingly worry about a new generation of deals that could give China a firmer grip on the technology of tomorrow.Sometimes it demands partnerships or intellectual property as the price of admission to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Sometimes it woos foreign giants with money and market access in ways that elude American and global trade rules.When concerned officials in Washington began blocking China\u2019s ability to buy high-end technology last year, one American company found a way to help its Chinese partner around those limits. The company, Advanced Micro Devices, avoided scrutiny by licensing its exclusive microchip designs, rather than selling them.The Chinese partner got access to the technology to make its own products. Advanced Micro Devices got a big payout.The rules of global commerce are changing \u2014 and China and the United States are racing to create a future that aligns with their own distinct visions. The result could be an overhaul of 20th-century trade rules for a 21st-century global economic order, in which money, ideas and influence could become as closely watched and tightly regulated as hard goods packed on a ship and sent abroad.Even before the Communist Revolution, China obsessed about absorbing foreign technology as a way to end a century of humiliation and restore its national strength. But Made in China 2025 is more ambitious than anything the government has ever attempted, a national industrial policy that aims to project a new type of global might and influence.Such efforts have some American government officials and business leaders calling for a rethinking of how the United States approaches trade. Lawmakers are pushing for tougher rules on technology purchases, which do not usually cover the types of deals that China increasingly prefers. Officials are also investigating whether China is stealing intellectual property.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good idea. I think it\u2019s the ultimate short-termism to give up very valuable I.T. in order to get a few quarters or a few years of improved sales.\u201dThe government hopes to change that. It is backing the effort with money: $45 billion in cheap loans for its companies, $3 billion for advanced manufacturing efforts and billions more in other financial support, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German think tank.Made in China 2025 \u201cis going to have substantial resources and focus devoted to it, especially at the local government level,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent venture capitalist in Beijing.The goal is not simply to beat the United States. China is preparing for a day when cheap manufacturing no longer keeps its economy humming. It wants to embrace industries offering skilled jobs that do not blacken its skies and cloud its rivers.The plan itself has specific targets and quotas. By 2025 it envisions China meeting nearly three-quarters of its own demand for industrial robots and more than a third of its demand for smartphone chips. Other targets cover new-energy cars, like electric cars, and high-performance medical devices.\u201cOur partnership with Kuka is actually about whole factory solutions,\u201d said Irene Chen, a spokeswoman for Midea.Where technology cannot be purchased, the government wants Chinese companies to extract it from foreign firms through deals or tough new laws.Cybersecurity laws enacted this summer give the Ministry of State Security the power to conduct security reviews of technology sold or used in China, said James A. Lewis, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Such a step could require companies to expose some of their most valuable secrets.At some companies, Chinese security officials conduct the inspections in corporate \u201cclean rooms\u201d in the United States, with the Chinese officials traveling on business visas, Mr. Lewis said. The companies argue that the access takes place under controlled circumstances that limit what Chinese officials might learn.\u201cIf American companies have a big market in China, they say to the Ministry of State Security, \u2018Come in,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cEveryone fears retaliation. No one wants to lose the China market.\u201dA.M.D.\u2019s joint venture with its Chinese partner can be found in a gleaming industrial area of the city of Chengdu called Tianfu Software Park.The park represents Beijing\u2019s vision of the future. Trees and sidewalks jammed with ride-sharing bikes sit beneath a vast strip of office towers, hotels and apartment complexes. Offices of China\u2019s most innovative companies, like Huawei and Tencent, sit next to outposts of their foreign analogues, like SAP and Accenture.Inside one of its glass towers, A.M.D. works with its Chinese partner, a company called Sugon, to produce new chips.Under the nearly $300 million deal, A.M.D. agreed to license chip technology to a Chinese joint venture with Sugon to make chips for servers. Because A.M.D. controls that joint venture, the technology is considered to remain in American hands.But A.M.D. struck a second partnership that the Chinese company controls. That joint venture works on applications such as integrating the chips with servers. The two ventures are on the 11th and 12th floors of the same building.\u201cWe have worked closely with and been very clear with U.S. government officials on the strategy and specifics of the technology, which is classified as permitted for export,\u201d an A.M.D. spokesman said in an emailed statement. He added that the processors are also lower performing than other options that A.M.D. sells in America.Executives in Chengdu said there was a firewall between the two joint ventures, and the one outside of A.M.D.\u2019s control was not involved in chip development.\u201cWhen they first announced the partnership I was shocked,\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst with Sanford Bernstein.\u201cYou would think intellectual property and joint ventures would belong under Cfius review,\u201d Mr. Rasgon said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign deals. \u201cIt should. It\u2019s surprising it isn\u2019t.\u201dFor some in the Trump administration, an 18-year-old book by two Chinese Air Force colonels has become required reading.Called \u201cUnrestricted Warfare,\u201d the book argues that China does not need to match the United States militarily. Instead China can take advantage of the global economy and the internet to take down its main rival.Some American officials see in it a guide to China\u2019s plan. Some United States lawmakers are proposing to toughen American takeover laws to evaluate deals on an economic as well as a national security basis. They are also pressing for reviews of licensing agreements and joint ventures. The United States trade representative has also launched an investigation into whether Chinese companies are stealing intellectual property.\u201cThere\u2019s concern that U.S. firms are transacting away their competitive advantages,\u201d said Greg Levesque, managing director of Pointe Bello, a research firm in Washington, and a former executive at the US-China Business Council.Such changes could ripple through the tech world. Chinese investment often means more money with fewer strings attached. Some tech companies say that is good for innovation. China\u2019s spending on science and research is also growing at a time when the United States government and others are cutting back.At a recent dinner event in Washington, an American technology executive held up a dinner plate to illustrate the size of the China market, said a person who was there who asked not to be identified because the event was not public. Then the American executive held up a wine coaster that represented the size of his firm\u2019s business.The message was clear: American companies are at risk of being muscled out of the market.\u201cMade in China 2025 seems to reject all notions of comparative advantage and future opportunities for high-value-added manufactured exports from the rest of the world to China,\u201d said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\u201cIf Made in China 2025 achieves its goals,\u201d he said, \u201cthe U.S. and other countries would likely become just commodity exporters to China \u2014 selling oil, gas, beef and soybeans.\u201dJane Perlez reported from Beijing, Paul Mozur from Shanghai, and Jonathan Ansfield from Chengdu, China.

In defending the decision on Friday, Ms. Sanders cited a recently completed Park Service review that had begun during the Obama administration.\u201cThis review established that both Zambia and Zimbabwe had met new standards, strict international conservation standards that allowed Americans to resume hunting in those countries,\u201d she told reporters during a news briefing.Under President Barack Obama, the practice had been banned because of a lack of data on conservation efforts in Zimbabwe.Safari Club International, a trophy-hunting organization that sued the Obama administration in 2014 in an effort to challenge the ban and was the first to report the policy change on Tuesday, lashed out against the news media and \u201canti-hunters\u201d for swaying the Trump administration to lift the trophy ban.\u201cThe fight for the freedom to hunt is far from over,\u201d Paul Babaz, the organization\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cWe will be more proactive and not back down.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s great that public outrage has forced Trump to reconsider this despicable decision,\u201d said Tanya Sanerib, a senior lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity, \u201cbut it takes more than a tweet to stop trophy hunters from slaughtering elephants and lions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Ackman\u2019s Battle With ADP Is a Litmus Test for Activist Investing", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne night in early August, Carlos Rodriguez, the chief executive of the payroll processing firm ADP, was driving home from a board meeting to celebrate his wife\u2019s birthday when he got a call that every corporate leader dreads. On the phone was William A. Ackman, the brash activist investor, announcing that he had taken a stake in ADP and wanted to shake up the board.\u201cI\u2019m, like, \u2018Oh, my God, I can\u2019t believe this is Bill Ackman calling,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said in a recent interview.As Mr. Rodriguez tells it, Mr. Ackman rattled off a list of demands, including installing a new chief executive. \u201cI was, like, \u2018O.K., that\u2019s a little surprising,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re trying to take over the company.\u201dMr. Ackman tells a different story. In an interview, he said that he had not called for Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s removal, and that ADP had put words in his mouth in an effort to distract from his argument that the company was underperforming.\u201cThe company\u2019s statements with respect to our seeking control of the board and seeking to fire the C.E.O. are just totally false,\u201d Mr. Ackman said.\u201cThis is a big, lumbering bureaucracy,\u201d Mr. Ackman said of ADP, laying out his case that the company was being overtaken by smaller, nimbler rivals. \u201cThey\u2019re being left behind.\u201dThe showdown will come to a head on Tuesday, when shareholders will vote whether to elect three new directors, including Mr. Ackman, to the ADP board, replacing existing directors. If Mr. Ackman and his allies are installed, it will send a signal that investors are eager for change at the $50 billion company. If investors reject Mr. Ackman\u2019s slate, it will be another blow to Mr. Ackman and his struggling hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management.It is the latest showdown between an established company and an activist investor trying to shake things up, and the result will be a litmus test of the shifting power of activists in an era of record corporate profits.By many measures, ADP was an unlikely target for Mr. Ackman. Activist investors typically go after poorly performing companies, and often ones that can be easily broken up.Today, ADP offers payroll, human resources and benefits services to companies large and small, and reported revenue of $12.4 billion last year. Revenue has grown steadily for years, and the stock has doubled over the last five years.\u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s the most obvious target, but it\u2019s one of the best,\u201d he said of ADP. \u201cWe look for the least amount of risk and the most amount of upside.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s had some challenges in the last four or five years,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said. \u201cThat could be part of the answer.\u201dThe grudge match between Mr. Ackman and Mr. Rodriguez, who attended Harvard together but did not know each other well, has overshadowed a more fundamental debate about how ADP is being run. Mr. Ackman argues that despite ADP\u2019s solid performance in recent years, it could be doing much better. The company should improve margins in its main business of payroll and benefits administration, Mr. Ackman argues, and reduce its organizational complexity, supplier costs and real estate costs. It should also offer new technology products faster, he says.Though that is a lot to ask of a nearly 70-year-old company, Mr. Ackman said such drastic changes were possible. \u201cMicrosoft was losing ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there was a change in leadership, and now they\u2019re making a lot of progress and a lot of money.\u201dMr. Ackman said that he had initially asked the company to work with him and avoid a public fight, but that Mr. Rodriguez and the board had become confrontational. As a result, Mr. Ackman started a campaign to elect himself and two other directors \u2014 Veronica M. Hagen, the former chief executive of Polymer Group, and V. Paul Unruh, a director at Symantec and a former Bechtel executive \u2014 to the ADP board.And during a presentation in August, Mr. Ackman did suggest that Mr. Rodriguez should be removed. \u201cHaving seen the reaction we got from Carlos, you know, his response,\u201d Mr. Ackman said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very likely in my view that this will require a change in the C.E.O. of the company.\u201dADP counters that its business is not nearly as bad as Mr. Ackman makes it out to be, and that the company is already doing much of what he recommends. It has begun reducing its real estate exposure, and is investing in new technology, Mr. Rodriguez said.But, Mr. Rodriguez said, activists like Mr. Ackman need to convince investors that they are the force behind big changes, leading to his scorched earth campaign.\u201cHis business model requires him being able to take credit,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said. \u201cIf ADP performs in the next five years the way it\u2019s performed over the last five years, he\u2019s going to look like a genius.\u201dIn recent days, the fight has only heated up. After Mr. Ackman claimed that ADP had made misleading statements as part of its proxy campaign, the company said it would file a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Ackman said he had filed his own complaints about ADP to the S.E.C.Equity analysts have been split over Mr. Ackman\u2019s bid, with some supporting him and others siding with the company. But two proxy advisory firms, Egan-Jones and Glass Lewis, have come out in support of Mr. Ackman and his nominees. In an unusual twist, Institutional Shareholders Services, the most influential of the advisory firms, encouraged investors to support Mr. Ackman but not Ms. Hagen or Mr. Unruh.The split decision from I.S.S. has raised the possibility that ADP and Pershing Square could come to an awkward draw, where Mr. Ackman is appointed to the board but his other nominees are not.Whatever the outcome, Mr. Ackman\u2019s campaign has made it clear that no company \u2014 not even one with steady revenue growth and a healthy stock price \u2014 is safe from activist investors.Advertisement"}

When I saw my results, I was terrified.\u201dWhen Ms. Gregory consulted with a neurologist about how to delay the onset of illness, he had four words for her: \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d After all, no drug had proven effective in reversing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And preventive measures like diet and exercise, the neurologist told her, would do no good.Ms. Gregory is not the sort of person who pops into your mind when you think of Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 youngish, healthy and sharp-minded. But she represents a type of sufferer we are likely to encounter more and more: those grappling with the looming threat of the disease rather than the disease itself.Scientists say they are on the cusp of developing blood tests that could detect the earliest signs of Alzheimer\u2019s damage in people in their 40s and 50s who have no obvious symptoms. Today, finding out whether dangerous plaques are building up in your brain requires either a PET scan at a cost of about $4,000 or a spinal tap. And while genetic tests can help predict risk, they don\u2019t tell us anything about the current state of your brain. Effective blood tests could reveal thousands \u2014 even millions \u2014 of people who are now living with a \u201cpre-Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d condition.Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.On Monday, Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft, wrote on his blog that \u201cmen in my family have suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d which means that he may have a high risk for dementia. He called for new approaches to combating the disease, including developing \u201ca more reliable, affordable and accessible diagnostic \u2014 such as a blood test.\u201d Mr. Gates also announced that he would be donating $100 million to fight Alzheimer\u2019s, which will no doubt help to make blood tests a reality.So you may be faced with some difficult choices within the next decade: Do you want to receive potentially alarming news about your cognitive health, or would you rather not? If you learn that you have a high risk for Alzheimer\u2019s, is that information you will want to keep private \u2014 from employers, clients, health insurers and others? Or will you want to openly embrace it as part of your identity and publicly advocate for a cure?In the difficult months after her genetic test, Ms. Gregory \u201cwanted to be with people who were going through the same devastation,\u201d so she sought out other ApoE4 carriers. In 2013, she and a few others started a nonprofit group and created a website (ApoE4.info) where the community could gather. Today the group has more than 2,000 members. They pore over medical journals, reach out to top researchers in the field and share notes about their experiments with diet, exercise and other lifestyle modifications.Many of the members maintain their anonymity for fear of being \u201couted\u201d as carriers of the gene variant. One member of the group \u2014 I\u2019ll call her D., after her first initial \u2014 told me that she feared public exposure almost as much as Alzheimer\u2019s itself.About 20 years ago, D. graduated from a top-tier law school. She spoke with rat-a-tat speed and juggled her many to-do lists in her mind. But in middle age, her memory began to tatter and she struggled sometimes to find words. She went to a hospital for a cognitive-health work-up and learned that she carries a single copy of the ApoE4 gene variant.She was alarmed. Her father, a neurologist, had retired in his 60s because his own mind felt \u201cwrong\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s likely he diagnosed the oncoming dementia in himself. \u201cI was just really scared of following in his footsteps,\u201d she said.But when D. joined the ApoE4 online community, other members reassured her that her risk profile was not as worrisome as it might seem. With only one copy of the \u201cbad\u201d ApoE4 gene variant and one \u201cgood\u201d variant, she has a much better outlook than those with two copies. She now feels that she managed to clear her brain fog in part by overhauling her diet and exercise habits. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t known about this gene,\u201d she said, \u201cwould I be on my stupid exercise bike first thing in the morning when I\u2019m hungry? No way.\u201dStill, D. has kept her genetic status a secret from all but her closest friends. \u201cIf you\u2019re working in a professional capacity, seeing clients who need to have confidence in your brain,\u201d she said, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t want them to know that you had this gene variant.\u201d She is afraid of being denied insurance and long-term disability care because of her genotype. And like many other ApoE4 carriers, she also worries about social stigma.Jason Karlawish, a professor of medicine and neurology at the University of Pennsylvania, studies how people at high risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease cope with that knowledge. \u201cWe have to make it socially acceptable to talk about having risk of getting dementia,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think that is one of the ground zero struggles we are going to face in the coming decades.\u201dMany health organizations discourage patients from learning their ApoE genotype. They warn that people may not be able to cope with bad news or will misinterpret the results. But according to Theresa, a member of the ApoE4 community who, like D., is protective of her privacy, it is paternalistic to decide how someone else should feel about the test. \u201cMy attitude is that you have to know the facts, analyze them and deal with them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sooner you know your gene status, the sooner you can start doing something about it.\u201dNot all cases of Alzheimer\u2019s can be traced to a particular gene variance, but for someone like Theresa \u2014 who has two copies of ApoE4 and is now in her late 50s \u2014 chances are high that she will be diagnosed with the disease within the next 10 to 20 years. Yet she said that this knowledge \u201chas been life-changing and positive.\u201d She now tracks her lipid levels, glucose levels and other biomarkers. When I interviewed her, she had just returned from skiing black-diamond trails in the Colorado mountains.David Holtzman, a neurologist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, has researched the ApoE gene for 25 years. But he has chosen not to look at his own ApoE4 genotype. Why do it, he asked me, when there is no drug or lifestyle strategy that is absolutely guaranteed to protect the brain? It would be far more useful if researchers could watch the disease as it spreads through the brain and wreaks its damage. That\u2019s why Dr. Holtzman and his colleagues are working on a method to detect the presence of markers in the blood that are red flags for brain illness.Everything about our relationship to Alzheimer\u2019s is in flux right now. The disease \u2014 once thought to be unpreventable \u2014 is beginning to look more like a multifactorial illness that might result from poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle, chronic inflammation, exposure to chemicals in the environment and genetics. Some scientists now describe Alzheimer\u2019s disease as another form of diabetes; others are pursuing a link between Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cardiovascular problems. And studies have shown a link between Alzheimer\u2019s and exposure to air pollution and head injuries. Many researchers in the field, including Dr. Holtzman, believe that the key to defeating Alzheimer\u2019s will be to catch it at the earliest possible moment and prevent it.It remains unclear whether lifestyle interventions can significantly delay cognitive decline. But the members of ApoE4 group believe that by banding together, sharing data and collaborating with scientists, they can improve their odds. \u201cWe are genetic pioneers, modern-day canaries in the coal mine, searching for and testing out strategies,\u201d reads the group\u2019s website. Rather than seeing themselves as victims of genetic bad luck, Ms. Gregory and her collaborators regard themselves as citizen scientists and activists who may be able to outsmart the disease.They are a reminder that diagnostic tests do more than predict our biological fates; they also perform a social and political function. They help turn strangers into a family, a tribe and, sometimes, a revolution. When the H.I.V. test became available in the 1980s, thousands of people suddenly felt connected to the disease. The test radicalized many of them, and those activists pushed for the reform of medical trials, requested a shorter drug approval process and fought against medical discrimination. Most consequentially, they demanded \u2014 and got \u2014 treatments that have extended the lives of AIDS patients by decades.So what would happen if something like an H.I.V. test for Alzheimer\u2019s were to exist in the near future, and millions of people found out that their brains were on the path to dementia? Dr. Alison Goate, a professor of neuroscience at Mount Sinai in New York, said the effects could be profound. Today there are no Alzheimer\u2019s survivors. That means that Alzheimer\u2019s patients \u201ccan\u2019t speak for themselves,\u201d she observed. Widespread blood tests could create an army of \u201cpre-Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d patients clamoring for breakthroughs in treatment.We need patient-advocates who can \u201cown\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s disease. They would represent a constituency other than that of the pharmaceutical companies that now control the conversation about the disease. A drug to prevent dementia could become the world\u2019s most profitable medicine. It\u2019s not a surprise to learn that one of the biggest insider-trading scandals in history involved a would-be Alzheimer\u2019s drug (which seemed effective in mouse brains but failed to help humans as much).When thousands of patients rise up, refuse to be stigmatized, discuss their symptoms and participate in research, science benefits. A new test for Alzheimer\u2019s could help to create that movement, but let\u2019s not wait. Twenty-five percent to 50 percent of us will show signs of Alzheimer\u2019s by the age of 85. When it comes to dementia, we all should consider ourselves vulnerable. No matter what genes you carry, your odds of developing cognitive problems increase as you age.In other words, welcome to the club: If you plan to live a long time, then you, too, belong to the high-risk group. Now what are you going to do about it?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can A.I. Be Taught to Explain Itself?", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "FeatureAs machine learning becomes more powerful, the field\u2019s researchers increasingly find themselves unable to account for what their algorithms know \u2014 or how they know it.Supported byKosinski has made a career of warning others about the uses and potential abuses of data. Four years ago, he was pursuing a Ph.D. in psychology, hoping to create better tests for signature personality traits like introversion or openness to change. But he and a collaborator soon realized that Facebook might render personality tests superfluous: Instead of asking if someone liked poetry, you could just see if they \u201cliked\u201d Poetry Magazine. In 2014, they published a study showing that if given 200 of a user\u2019s likes, they could predict that person\u2019s personality-test answers better than their own romantic partner could.After getting his Ph.D., Kosinski landed a teaching position at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and soon started looking for new data sets to investigate. One in particular stood out: faces. For decades, psychologists have been leery about associating personality traits with physical characteristics, because of the lasting taint of phrenology and eugenics; studying faces this way was, in essence, a taboo. But to understand what that taboo might reveal when questioned, Kosinski knew he couldn\u2019t rely on a human judgment.Kosinski first mined 200,000 publicly posted dating profiles, complete with pictures and information ranging from personality to political views. Then he poured that data into an open-source facial-recognition algorithm \u2014 a so-called deep neural network, built by researchers at Oxford University \u2014 and asked it to find correlations between people\u2019s faces and the information in their profiles. The algorithm failed to turn up much, until, on a lark, Kosinski turned its attention to sexual orientation. The results almost defied belief. In previous research, the best any human had done at guessing sexual orientation from a profile picture was about 60 percent \u2014 slightly better than a coin flip. Given five pictures of a man, the deep neural net could predict his sexuality with as much as 91 percent accuracy. For women, that figure was lower but still remarkable: 83 percent.It was Kosinski\u2019s own research, but when he tried to answer that question, he was reduced to a painstaking hunt for clues. At first, he tried covering up or exaggerating parts of faces, trying to see how those changes would affect the machine\u2019s predictions. Results were inconclusive. But Kosinski knew that women, in general, have bigger foreheads, thinner jaws and longer noses than men. So he had the computer spit out the 100 faces it deemed most likely to be gay or straight and averaged the proportions of each. It turned out that the faces of gay men exhibited slightly more \u201cfeminine\u201d proportions, on average, and that the converse was true for women. If this was accurate, it could support the idea that testosterone levels \u2014 already known to mold facial features \u2014 help mold sexuality as well.But it was impossible to say for sure. Other evidence seemed to suggest that the algorithms might also be picking up on culturally driven traits, like straight men wearing baseball hats more often. Or \u2014 crucially \u2014 they could have been picking up on elements of the photos that humans don\u2019t even recognize. \u201cHumans might have trouble detecting these tiny footprints that border on the infinitesimal,\u201d Kosinski says. \u201cComputers can do that very easily.\u201dIt has become commonplace to hear that machines, armed with machine learning, can outperform humans at decidedly human tasks, from playing Go to playing \u201cJeopardy!\u201d We assume that is because computers simply have more data-crunching power than our soggy three-pound brains. Kosinski\u2019s results suggested something stranger: that artificial intelligences often excel by developing whole new ways of seeing, or even thinking, that are inscrutable to us. It\u2019s a more profound version of what\u2019s often called the \u201cblack box\u201d problem \u2014 the inability to discern exactly what machines are doing when they\u2019re teaching themselves novel skills \u2014 and it has become a central concern in artificial-intelligence research. In many arenas, A.I. methods have advanced with startling speed; deep neural networks can now detect certain kinds of cancer as accurately as a human. But human doctors still have to make the decisions \u2014 and they won\u2019t trust an A.I. unless it can explain itself.This isn\u2019t merely a theoretical concern. In 2018, the European Union will begin enforcing a law requiring that any decision made by a machine be readily explainable, on penalty of fines that could cost companies like Google and Facebook billions of dollars. The law was written to be powerful and broad and fails to define what constitutes a satisfying explanation or how exactly those explanations are to be reached. It represents a rare case in which a law has managed to leap into a future that academics and tech companies are just beginning to devote concentrated effort to understanding. As researchers at Oxford dryly noted, the law \u201ccould require a complete overhaul of standard and widely used algorithmic techniques\u201d \u2014 techniques already permeating our everyday lives.Those techniques can seem inescapably alien to our own ways of thinking. Instead of certainty and cause, A.I. works off probability and correlation. And yet A.I. must nonetheless conform to the society we\u2019ve built \u2014 one in which decisions require explanations, whether in a court of law, in the way a business is run or in the advice our doctors give us. The disconnect between how we make decisions and how machines make them, and the fact that machines are making more and more decisions for us, has birthed a new push for transparency and a field of research called explainable A.I., or X.A.I. Its goal is to make machines able to account for the things they learn, in ways that we can understand. But that goal, of course, raises the fundamental question of whether the world a machine sees can be made to match our own.Machine learning isn\u2019t just one technique. It encompasses entire families of them, from \u201cboosted decision trees,\u201d which allow an algorithm to change the weighting it gives to each data point, to \u201crandom forests,\u201d which average together many thousands of randomly generated decision trees. The sheer proliferation of different techniques, none of them obviously better than the others, can leave researchers flummoxed over which one to choose. Many of the most powerful are bafflingly opaque; others evade understanding because they involve an avalanche of statistical probability. It can be almost impossible to peek inside the box and see what, exactly, is happening.Rich Caruana, an academic who works at Microsoft Research, has spent almost his entire career in the shadow of this problem. When he was earning his Ph.D at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1990s, his thesis adviser asked him and a group of others to train a neural net \u2014 a forerunner of the deep neural net \u2014 to help evaluate risks for patients with pneumonia. Between 10 and 11 percent of cases would be fatal; others would be less urgent, with some percentage of patients recovering just fine without a great deal of medical attention. The problem was figuring out which cases were which \u2014 a high-stakes question in, say, an emergency room, where doctors have to make quick decisions about what kind of care to offer. Of all the machine-learning techniques students applied to this question, Caruana\u2019s neural net was the most effective. But when someone on the staff of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center asked him if they should start using his algorithm, \u201cI said no,\u201d Caruana recalls. \u201cI said we don\u2019t understand what it does inside. I said I was afraid.\u201dThe problem was in the algorithm\u2019s design. Classical neural nets focus only on whether the prediction they gave is right or wrong, tweaking and weighing and recombining all available morsels of data into a tangled web of inferences that seems to get the job done. But some of these inferences could be terrifically wrong. Caruana was particularly concerned by something another graduate student noticed about the data they were handling: It seemed to show that asthmatics with pneumonia fared better than the typical patient. This correlation was real, but the data masked its true cause. Asthmatic patients who contract pneumonia are immediately flagged as dangerous cases; if they tended to fare better, it was because they got the best care the hospital could offer. A dumb algorithm, looking at this data, would have simply assumed asthma meant a patient was likely to get better \u2014 and thus concluded that they were in less need of urgent care.\u201cI knew I could probably fix the program for asthmatics,\u201d Caruana says. \u201cBut what else did the neural net learn that was equally wrong? It couldn\u2019t warn me about the unknown unknowns. That tension has bothered me since the 1990s.\u201dThe story of asthmatics with pneumonia eventually became a legendary allegory in the machine-learning community. Today, Caruana is one of perhaps a few dozen researchers in the United States dedicated to finding more transparent new approaches to machine learning. For the last six years, he has been creating a new model that combines a number of machine-learning techniques. The result is as accurate as his original neural network, and it can spit out charts that show how each individual variable \u2014 from asthma to age \u2014 is predictive of mortality risk, making it easier to see which ones exhibit particularly unusual behavior. Immediately, asthmatics are revealed as a far outlier. Other strange truths surface, too: For example, risk for people age 100 goes down suddenly. \u201cIf you made it to this round number of 100,\u201d Caruana says, \u201cit seemed as if the doctors were saying, \u2018Let\u2019s try to get you another year,\u2019 which might not happen if you\u2019re 93.\u201dCaruana may have brought clarity to his own project, but his solution only underscored the fact the explainability is a kaleidoscopic problem. The explanation a doctor needs from a machine isn\u2019t the same as the one a fighter pilot might need or the one an N.S.A. analyst sniffing out a financial fraud might need. Different details will matter, and different technical means will be needed for finding them. You couldn\u2019t, for example, simply use Caruana\u2019s techniques on facial data, because they don\u2019t apply to image recognition. There may, in other words, eventually have to be as many approaches to explainability as there are approaches to machine learning itself.The researchers in Gunning\u2019s group stepped confidently up to the white board, showing off new, more powerful ways to draw predictions from a machine and then visualize them. But the intelligence analyst evaluating their pitches, a woman who couldn\u2019t tell anyone in the room what she did or what tools she was using, waved it all away. Gunning remembers her as plainly dressed, middle-aged, typical of the countless government agents he had known who toiled thanklessly in critical jobs. \u201cNone of this solves my problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be able to visualize another recommendation. If I\u2019m going to sign off on a decision, I need to be able to justify it.\u201d She was issuing what amounted to a broadside. It wasn\u2019t just that a clever graph indicating the best choice wasn\u2019t the same as explaining why that choice was correct. The analyst was pointing to a legal and ethical motivation for explainability: Even if a machine made perfect decisions, a human would still have to take responsibility for them \u2014 and if the machine\u2019s rationale was beyond reckoning, that could never happen.Gunning, a grandfatherly military man whose buzz cut has survived his stints as a civilian, is a program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. He works in Darpa\u2019s shiny new midrise tower in downtown Alexandria, Va. \u2014 an office indistinguishable from the others nearby, except that the security guard out front will take away your cellphone and warn you that turning on the Wi-Fi on your laptop will make security personnel materialize within 30 seconds. Darpa managers like Gunning don\u2019t have permanent jobs; the expectation is that they serve four-year \u201ctours,\u201d dedicated to funding cutting-edge research along a single line of inquiry. When he found himself at the brainstorming session, Gunning had recently completed his second tour as a sort of Johnny Appleseed for A.I.: Starting in the 1990s, he has founded hundreds of projects, from the first application of machine-learning techniques to the internet, which presaged the first search engines, to the project that eventually spun off as Siri, Apple\u2019s voice-controlled assistant. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a dinosaur,\u201d he says with a smile.As of now, most of the military\u2019s practical applications of such technology involve performing enormous calculations beyond the reach of human patience, like predicting how to route supplies. But there are more ambitious applications on the horizon. One recent research program tried to use machine learning to sift through millions of video clips and internet messages in Yemen to detect cease-fire violations; if the machine does find something, it has to be able to describe what\u2019s worth paying attention to. Another pressing need is for drones flying on self-directed missions to be able to explain their limitations so that the humans commanding the drones know what the machines can \u2014 and cannot \u2014 be asked to do. Explainability has thus become a hurdle for a wealth of possible projects, and the Department of Defense has begun to turn its eye to the problem.After that brainstorming session, Gunning took the analyst\u2019s story back to Darpa and soon signed up for his third tour. As he flew across the country meeting with computer scientists to help design an overall strategy for tackling the problem of X.A.I., what became clear was that the field needed to collaborate more broadly and tackle grander problems. Computer science, having leapt beyond the bounds of considering purely technical problems, had to look further afield \u2014 to experts, like cognitive scientists, who study the ways humans and machines interact.This represents a full circle for Gunning, who began his career as a cognitive psychologist working on how to design better automated systems for fighter pilots. Later, he began working on what\u2019s now called \u201cold-fashioned A.I.\u201d \u2014 so-called expert systems in which machines were given voluminous lists of rules, then tasked with drawing conclusions by recombining those rules. None of those efforts was particularly successful, because it was impossible to give the computer a set of rules long enough, or flexible enough, to approximate the power of human reasoning. A.I.\u2019s current blossoming came only when researchers began inventing new techniques for letting machines find their own patterns in the data.Gunning\u2019s X.A.I. initiative, which kicked off this year, provides $75 million in funding to 12 new research programs; by the power of the purse strings, Gunning has refocused the energies of a significant part of the American A.I. research community. His hope is that by making these new A.I. methods accountable to the demands of human psychology, they will become both more useful and more powerful. \u201cThe real secret is finding a way to put labels on the concepts inside a deep neural net,\u201d he says. If the concepts inside can be labeled, then they can be used for reasoning \u2014 just like those expert systems were supposed to do in A.I.\u2019s first wave.To create a neural net that can reveal its inner workings, the researchers in Gunning\u2019s portfolio are pursuing a number of different paths. Some of these are technically ingenious \u2014 for example, designing new kinds of deep neural networks made up of smaller, more easily understood modules, which can fit together like Legos to accomplish complex tasks. Others involve psychological insight: One team at Rutgers is designing a deep neural network that, once it makes a decision, can then sift through its data set to find the example that best demonstrates why it made that decision. (The idea is partly inspired by psychological studies of real-life experts like firefighters, who don\u2019t clock in for a shift thinking, These are the 12 rules for fighting fires; when they see a fire before them, they compare it with ones they\u2019ve seen before and act accordingly.) Perhaps the most ambitious of the dozen different projects are those that seek to bolt new explanatory capabilities onto existing deep neural networks. Imagine giving your pet dog the power of speech, so that it might finally explain what\u2019s so interesting about squirrels. Or, as Trevor Darrell, a lead investigator on one of those teams, sums it up, \u201cThe solution to explainable A.I. is more A.I.\u201dFive years ago, Darrell and some colleagues had a novel idea for letting an A.I. teach itself how to describe the contents of a picture. First, they created two deep neural networks: one dedicated to image recognition and another to translating languages. Then they lashed these two together and fed them thousands of images that had captions attached to them. As the first network learned to recognize the objects in a picture, the second simply watched what was happening in the first, then learned to associate certain words with the activity it saw. Working together, the two networks could identify the features of each picture, then label them. Soon after, Darrell was presenting some different work to a group of computer scientists when someone in the audience raised a hand, complaining that the techniques he was describing would never be explainable. Darrell, without a second thought, said, Sure \u2014 but you could make it explainable by once again lashing two deep neural networks together, one to do the task and one to describe it.Darrell\u2019s previous work had piggybacked on pictures that were already captioned. What he was now proposing was creating a new data set and using it in a novel way. Let\u2019s say you had thousands of videos of baseball highlights. An image-recognition network could be trained to spot the players, the ball and everything happening on the field, but it wouldn\u2019t have the words to label what they were. But you might then create a new data set, in which volunteers had written sentences describing the contents of every video. Once combined, the two networks should then be able to answer queries like \u201cShow me all the double plays involving the Boston Red Sox\u201d \u2014 and could potentially show you what cues, like the logos on uniforms, it used to figure out who the Boston Red Sox are.Call it the Hamlet strategy: lending a deep neural network the power of internal monologue, so that it can narrate what\u2019s going on inside. But do the concepts that a network has taught itself align with the reality that humans are describing, when, for example, narrating a baseball highlight? Is the network recognizing the Boston Red Sox by their logo or by some other obscure signal, like \u201cmedian facial-hair distribution,\u201d that just happens to correlate with the Red Sox? Does it actually have the concept of \u201cBoston Red Sox\u201d or just some other strange thing that only the computer understands? It\u2019s an ontological question: Is the deep neural network really seeing a world that corresponds to our own?We human beings seem to be obsessed with black boxes: The highest compliment we give to technology is that it feels like magic. When the workings of a new technology is too obvious, too easy to explain, it can feel banal and uninteresting. But when I asked David Jensen \u2014 a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and one of the researchers being funded by Gunning \u2014 why X.A.I. had suddenly become a compelling topic for research, he sounded almost soulful: \u201cWe want people to make informed decisions about whether to trust autonomous systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019re depriving people of the ability to be fully independent human beings.\u201dFor many, this law seems frustratingly vague. Some legal scholars argue that it might be toothless in practice. Others claim that it will require the basic workings of Facebook and Google to change, lest they face penalties of 4 percent of their revenue. It remains to be seen whether complying with the law will mean a heap of fine print and an extra check box buried in a pop-up window, some new kind of warning-label system marking every machine-made decision or much more profound changes.If Google is one of the companies most endangered by this new scrutiny on A.I., it\u2019s also the company with the greatest wherewithal to lead the whole industry in solving the problem. Even among the company\u2019s astonishing roster of A.I. talent, one particular star is Chris Olah, who holds the title of research scientist \u2014 a title shared by Google\u2019s many ex-professors and Ph.D.s \u2014 without ever having completed more than a year of college. Olah has been working for the last couple of years on creating new ways to visualize the inner workings of a deep neural network. You might recall when Google created a hallucinatory tool called Deep Dream, which produced psychedelic distortions when you fed it an image and which went viral when people used it to create hallucinatory mash-ups like a doll covered in a pattern of doll eyes and a portrait of Vincent Van Gogh made up in places of bird beaks. Olah was one of many Google researchers on the team, led by Alex Mordvintsev, that worked on Deep Dream. It may have seemed like a folly, but it was actually a technical steppingstone.Olah speaks faster and faster as he sinks into an idea, and the words tumbled out of him almost too quickly to follow as he explained what he found so exciting about the work he was doing. \u201cThe truth is, it\u2019s really beautiful. There\u2019s some sense in which we don\u2019t know what it means to see. We don\u2019t understand how humans do it,\u201d he told me, hands gesturing furiously. \u201cWe want to understand something not just about neural nets but something deeper about reality.\u201d Olah\u2019s hope is that deep neural networks reflect something deeper about parsing data \u2014 that insights gleaned from them might in turn shed light on how our brains work.Watching him use the tool, I realized that it was exactly what the psychologist Michal Kosinski needed \u2014 a key to unlock what his deep neural network was seeing when it categorized profile pictures as gay or straight. Kosinski\u2019s most optimistic view of his research was that it represented a new kind of science in which machines could access truths that lay beyond human intuition. The problem was reducing what a computer knew into a single conclusion that a human could grasp and consider. He had painstakingly tested his data set by hand and found evidence that the computer might be discovering hormonal signals in facial structure. That evidence was still fragmentary. But with the tool that Olah showed me, or one like it, Kosinski might have been able to pull back the curtain on how his mysterious A.I. was working. It would be as obvious and intuitive as a picture the computer had drawn on its own.Cliff Kuang is a writer at large for Fast Company and the author of \u201cUser Friendly,\u201d which will be published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Silicon Valley Plans to Conquer the Classroom", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEducation DisruptedBALTIMORE COUNTY, Md. \u2014 They call it the \u201cChurch Lane Hug.\u201dThat is how educators at Church Lane Elementary Technology, a public school here, describe the protective two-armed way they teach students to carry their school-issued laptops.And Silicon Valley has embraced the school district right back.Silicon Valley is going all out to own America\u2019s school computer-and-software market, projected to reach $21 billion in sales by 2020. An industry has grown up around courting public-school decision makers, and tech companies are using a sophisticated playbook to reach them, The New York Times has found in a review of thousands of pages of Baltimore County school documents and in interviews with dozens of school officials, researchers, teachers, tech executives and parents.School leaders have become so central to sales that a few private firms will now, for fees that can climb into the tens of thousands of dollars, arrange meetings for vendors with school officials, on some occasions paying superintendents as consultants. Tech-backed organizations have also flown superintendents to conferences at resorts. And school leaders have evangelized company products to other districts.Tech companies have not gone as far as drug companies, which have regularly paid doctors to give speeches. But industry practices, like flying school officials to speak at events and taking school leaders to steak and sushi restaurants, merit examination, some experts say.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be paid by Big Pharma, or Big Ed Tech, to be influenced,\u201d Dr. Boyd said. She has raised concerns about the tech initiative at school board meetings.In a district riven by disparities, Dallas Dance, the superintendent from 2012 through this past summer, made an appealing argument for a tech makeover. To help students develop new-economy skills, he said, every school must provide an equitable digital learning environment \u2014 including giving every student the same device.\u201cWhy does a first grader need to have it?\u201d Mr. Dance said in an interview last year. \u201cIn order to break the silos of equity, you\u2019ve got to say that everyone gets it.\u201dThe district wanted a device that would work both for youngsters who couldn\u2019t yet type and for high schoolers. In early 2014, it chose a particularly complex machine, an HP laptop that converts to a tablet. That device ranked third out of four devices the district considered, according to the district\u2019s hardware evaluation forms, which The Times obtained. Over all, the HP device scored 27 on a 46-point scale. A Dell device ranked first at 34.The district's hardware evaluations for HP, Dell, Apple and Lenovo devices. The winning device: HP.Mychael Dickerson, a school district spokesman, said, \u201cThe device chosen was the one that was closely aligned to what was recommended by stakeholders.\u201d Daly did not respond to inquiries.With the laptop deal sealed, Silicon Valley kicked into gear.In September 2014, shortly after the first schools received laptops, HP invited the superintendent to give a keynote speech at a major education conference in New York City. Soon after, Gus Schmedlen, HP\u2019s vice president for worldwide education, described the event at a school board meeting.\u201cWe had to pick one group, one group to present what was the best education technology plan in the world for the last academic year,\u201d Mr. Schmedlen said. \u201cAnd guess whose it was? Baltimore County Public Schools!\u201dAn HP spokesman said the company did not pay for the trip. He said the company does not provide \u201ccompensation, meals, travel or other perks to school administrators or any other public sector officials.\u201dRecently, parents and teachers have reported problems with the HP devices, including batteries falling out and keyboard tiles becoming detached. HP has discontinued the Elitebook Revolve.Mr. Dickerson, the district spokesman, said there was not \u201ca widespread issue with damaged devices.\u201dAn HP spokesman said: \u201cWhile the Revolve is no longer on the market, it would be factually inaccurate to suggest that\u2019s related to product quality.\u201dAsked what device would eventually replace the Revolve in the schools, the district said it was asking vendors for proposals.A Baltimore County school board member, David Uhlfelder, said a representative from the Office of the Maryland State Prosecutor had interviewed him in September about Mr. Dance\u2019s relationship with a former school vendor (a company not in the tech industry).The prosecutor\u2019s office declined to confirm or deny its interest in Mr. Dance.Mr. Dance, who discussed the district\u2019s tech initiatives with a Times reporter last year, did not respond to repeated emails and phone calls this week seeking comment.Mr. Dance\u2019s travel schedule sheds light on that world.Between March 2014, when the laptop contract was announced, and April 2017, when he announced his resignation, Mr. Dance took at least 65 out-of-state trips related to the district\u2019s tech initiatives or involving industry-funded groups, according to a Times analysis of travel documents obtained under public records laws \u2014 nearly two trips per month on average. Those trips cost more than $33,000. The Times counted only trips with local receipts, indicating Mr. Dance set foot in the cities.At least $13,000 of Mr. Dance\u2019s airline tickets, hotel bills, meals and other fees were paid for by organizations sponsored by tech companies, some of which were school vendors, The Times found. The $13,000 is an incomplete number, because some groups cover superintendents\u2019 costs directly, which means school records may not include them.Another way tech companies reach superintendents is to pay private businesses that set up conferences or small-group meetings with them. Superintendents nationwide have attended these events.ERDI offered several service levels this year, according to a membership rate card obtained by The Times. A $13,000 fee for Bronze membership entitles a company to one confidential meeting, where executives can meet with five school leaders to discuss products and school needs. Diamond members could pay $66,000 for six such meetings.The Education Research and Development Institute, known as ERDI, charges membership fees to school vendors to arrange small-group meetings with superintendents who can provide product feedback.\u201cBecause we are asking for their time and expertise, we commonly offer to pay the cost of their food, transportation and lodging during their participation,\u201d ERDI\u2019s president, David M. Sundstrom, said in an email.Mr. Dance\u2019s calendar indicated that he had attended at least five ERDI events.Mr. Dance received payment last year as an adviser for ERDI, according to his most recent district financial disclosure. It lists Dulle Enterprises, a company that owned ERDI in the past, as an employer from which he earned income.Last February, at an ERDI conference in New Orleans, Mr. Dance met with Curriculum Associates, which makes reading software, as well as DreamBox Learning, a math platform.A DreamBox spokeswoman said there was no connection between the meeting and its contract. \u201cEven the appearance of impropriety is something we take very seriously and take steps to avoid,\u201d she said.A Curriculum Associates spokeswoman said: \u201cThese panels are not sales presentations, but rather focus-group opportunities to solicit feedback on products under development.\u201dMs. White, the interim superintendent, has been involved with ERDI since 2013, according to Mr. Dickerson. He said Ms. White used vacation time to attend events, where she \u201cprovided guidance to education-related companies on goods, services and products that are in development to benefit student performance.\u201dAsked whether Ms. White had received ERDI payments, Mr. Dickerson said, \u201cParticipation in ERDI is done independently of the school system.\u201d In an email, Ms. White said she found ERDI to be a \u201cbeneficial professional learning experience.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond to a question about ERDI compensation.She added, \u201cI do not believe there are any conflicts of interests\u201d related to the district\u2019s tech initiative.Mr. Sundstrom, ERDI\u2019s president, said education companies pay a fee to attend events \u201cnot to meet school leaders or make a sale,\u201d but to get meaningful feedback on their education products from knowledgeable school leaders. He added that school officials do not make purchases at ERDI sessions and that it is their school boards that approve district purchases.Baltimore County\u2019s travel rules say, \u201cNo travel expenses will be paid by those seeking to do business with the Baltimore County Public Schools prior to obtaining a contract.\u201d Mr. Dickerson explained that applied to companies currently bidding for contracts.\u201cYou have these huge contracts, and then you donate all this money, and the foundation puts up a banner advertising your company\u2019s name,\u201d said Michael J. Collins, a former Maryland state senator and former school board member. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think that passed the smell test.\u201dDiscovery Education said it trained employees to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Microsoft said its policies followed government gift and ethics rules. Pearson said its donation had been nominal and vetted to prevent conflict of interest. McGraw-Hill said it was committed to integrity and transparency.When asked if the foundation had policies governing donations from vendors or potential vendors, Ms. Phelps said no. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s not necessarily a policy,\u201d she said. There is also no policy prohibiting foundation board members who are vendors from reviewing grants involving their or competitors\u2019 products, she said.Mr. Dickerson said the focus of Baltimore County Public Schools was on \u201csupporting students, teachers and their learning environments.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are unapologetic for engaging with our Education Foundation, business partners and community stakeholders in an effort to close known achievement gaps.\u201dMr. Reich of Stanford suggested school districts establish clearer rules governing their relationships with vendors, particularly with tech companies racing to win over the gatekeepers to America\u2019s classrooms. Otherwise, parents could lose trust in the system.\u201cSchool leaders should be just as concerned about the perception of corruption as actual corruption,\u201d he said.Lilia Chang contributed reporting from Washington, and Jeremy Merrill from New York.

{"Headline": "Drone Maker D.J.I. May Be Sending Data to China, U.S. Officials Say", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 D.J.I., the popular drone maker, stands as a symbol of China\u2019s growing technology prowess. Its propeller-powered machines dominate global markets and buzz regularly over beaches, cityscapes at sunset and increasingly, power plants and government installations.Now D.J.I. is fighting a claim by one United States government office that its commercial drones and software may be sending sensitive information about American infrastructure back to China, in the latest clash over the power of data in the growing technological rivalry between the two countries. It also shows how consumer technology companies have become increasingly central to debates about national security.It said officials had \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that the D.J.I.\u2019s commercial drones and software are \u201cproviding U.S. critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government.\u201d It cited what it called a reliable source, who it did not identify, in the drone industry \u201cwith first and secondhand access.\u201dIn a statement, D.J.I. said the report was \u201cbased on clearly false and misleading claims.\u201d\u201cThe allegations in the bulletin are so profoundly wrong as a factual matter that ICE should consider withdrawing it, or at least correcting its unsupportable assertions,\u201d the company said.The allegations could not be independently confirmed, and a spokeswoman for I.C.E. declined to comment. In a statement to The New York Times, a D.J.I. spokesman said that users can control how much access the company can have to their data and that it shares data only \u201cpursuant to appropriate legal process.\u201dThe accusations point to a broadening debate in both the United States and China over how to secure vast data reserves that are being vacuumed up by commercial technology companies. Likened by metaphor-minded tech types to gold or oil, data has become a hugely valuable way to suss out market trends and target ads.Now equipped with remote sensing technology to monitor crops, infrared scanners to scrutinize power lines, cameras and tracking systems, drones \u2014 much like smartphones \u2014 are the stuff of espionage dreams. Customers often have little knowledge of where their data might end up, experts said, while D.J.I. and others give themselves considerable leeway in the fine print of their user agreements to transfer data across borders.As consumer and commercial drones increase in popularity, the government is taking more steps to address safety concerns and regulate the aerial vehicles.American intelligence and political circles are beginning to consider how companies and governments manage the data they collect. Given that major Chinese companies must maintain close ties to the government, new China tech players like D.J.I. have raised particular concerns.This summer, the United States Army issued guidance calling for forces to stop using D.J.I. drones because of unspecified security vulnerabilities.Yet those worries have not spread widely to customers, according to Colin Snow, chief executive of Skylogic.\u201cOnly those few who use drones around critical infrastructure are concerned and chose not to use D.J.I.,\u201d Mr. Snow said in an email. \u201cThe rest don\u2019t care because of the price/benefit of D.J.I. aircraft.\u201dThe I.C.E. memo listed what it said were a number of examples of D.J.I. drones used in potentially sensitive areas. It said that a Department of Homeland Security facility built to study diseases that threaten American agriculture and public health used D.J.I. drones to assist with construction layout and security. The agency did not respond to a request for comment.The memo said in other cases, water reserves, power plants, rail hubs and other large-scale infrastructure were often monitored by Chinese-made drones.\u201cMuch of the information collected includes proprietary and sensitive critical infrastructure data, such as detailed imagery of power control panels, security measures for critical infrastructure sites, or materials used in bridge construction,\u201d the memo said.D.J.I. said that consumers have total control over whether to upload data, such as flight plans and video, to the company\u2019s servers. Yet like many apps, the company\u2019s software encourages such uploads. D.J.I.\u2019s app offers an automatic function to store user flight logs periodically, though it can be turned off. Out of concerns about data protection, the company added a feature last year that allows a drone pilot to cut off any connection to the outside internet while flying.A new D.J.I. product set up to help large companies, government agencies, farms and law enforcement manage drones, uploads a large amount of critical data \u2014 like flight plans, video and location \u2014 to servers. D.J.I. said it was working out the terms of service for the product, and will likely include an option to allow companies to store data to their own servers.Similar concerns have emerged in China over Apple\u2019s products. In particular, state-run media have showed how the iPhone keeps track of a user\u2019s commonly visited locations. Turning off the function requires a journey deep into the phone\u2019s settings. Apple has said it has strong data privacy and security protections in place in China.For D.J.I., questions about its data storage practices are not new. Last year company officials told The New York Times that it complied with Chinese government requests to hand over data it collects in China and Hong Kong.Dan Tentler, founder of Phobos Group, a computer-security company, said such weaknesses were often a bad sign.\u201cIn my experience doing security assessments I\u2019ve never found a massive pile of egregiously staggering security problems somewhere to then find a shining, palace of hardened impenetrable security elsewhere in the org,\u201d he wrote in a Twitter message.In terms of companies with major security vulnerabilities in one part of the company, he added, \u201cit\u2019ll be a Dumpster fire the whole way through.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave the wrong surname for the chief executive of Skylogic, a drone research firm. He is Colin Snow, not Pine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Trumpets Its Cloud Lead With N.F.L. and Other Deals", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 The holidays are a time when there are constant reminders of how much Amazon dominates online shopping \u2014 the boxes stacking up on front porches, for example.It\u2019s also when Amazon puffs its chest out to say how big it is becoming in a different and much more profitable market: technology used by businesses.One of the customers that Amazon revealed, the National Football League, illustrated how cloud computing is moving beyond basic capabilities like online storage. Those abilities first attracted start-ups and large corporations to the concept of renting computing services from an internet company, rather than running it all themselves.The N.F.L. said it would use Amazon\u2019s advanced machine-learning capabilities \u2014 software that helps recognize patterns and make predictions \u2014 to quickly analyze data captured during games. The data could provide new kinds of statistics for fans and insights that could help coaches.The N.F.L. and Amazon declined to discuss the financial terms of their relationship.Amazon also announced a handful of other new machine-learning efforts. Customers using A.W.S., as the cloud division within Amazon is often called, will be able to add capabilities that mimic human cognition, such as automatic transcribing of speech to text and analysis of videos. Those services are usually expensive and daunting for many companies to add to their applicationsA.W.S. started as a curious side project for the internet retailer more than a decade ago. It has since mushroomed into one of the most important technology providers. It brought in over $12 billion in revenue for Amazon during the first nine months of the year, up 42 percent from a year earlier.More important, A.W.S. generated almost $3 billion in operating income, an enormous benefit to a company which brings in little to no profit from its retail operations.Amazon has caught most of the industry by surprise with its growth into a cloud computing powerhouse. Two rivals, Microsoft and Google, have shown the most determination to narrow Amazon\u2019s lead. Both competitors are also investing heavily in giving machine-learning capabilities to customers.Urs H\u00f6lzle, Google\u2019s senior vice president of technical infrastructure, said his company saw the biggest opportunity in winning over the huge numbers of customers who have not yet shifted their computing chores to the cloud, rather than convincing those that have already adopted Amazon\u2019s services to do so.\u201cFor us to grow very quickly, we don\u2019t need to steal A.W.S. users,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hacks That Help: Using Tech to Fight Child Exploitation", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpending the weekend in front of a computer sounds like a nightmare, especially to people who already spend most of their week in front of a screen. Still, 100 engineers gathered in Manhattan for a weekend hackathon earlier this month.They traveled from around the country to work with Thorn, a nonprofit that uses technology to fight adolescent and child sexual exploitation. Founded in 2009 by Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher as the DNA Foundation, with a mission of combating trafficking, Thorn was renamed in 2012 after the couple split, and expanded its mission to better incorporate technology in the fight against trafficking.\u201cWe get to use our skills for good,\u201d said Federico Gomez Suarez, a program manager in operations at Microsoft. Mr. Gomez Suarez has been volunteering for Thorn, with support from Microsoft, for two years.His group project focuses on how to help authorities identify missing or exploited children that appear in escort ads. Creating a program to quickly sort through the tens of thousands of images as quickly as possible requires answering many questions.\u201cWe want to create a program that can quickly ask, \u2018Is this child in several ads? Does the ad have text? Are there other ads with similar text? If so, is it possible they were made by the same person?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gomez Suarez said.Thorn has software with the ability to search through text ads, but wants to be able to better search through images. Engineers and law enforcement agencies focus on information from the solicitation ads posted on sites like Night Shift, Erotic Monkey and Backpage.Thorn\u2019s team garnered insight, they said, from talking to child sex trafficking victims who had worked in prostitution, and from that, created their first tool, called Spotlight.\u201cSometimes kids were forced to write their own escort ads to sell themselves,\u201d said Julie Cordua, the C.E.O. of Thorn. \u201cWe wondered: Can you analyze the writing in an ad, and if you have a hundred ads and somewhere was one that was written by a child, could you raise that one to the surface by running algorithms on top of it to say, \u2018Which of these ads was written by a child?\u2019\u201d\u201cSpotlight condenses a lot of the information out there on sites like Backpage into a format that we can more easily use to identify people faster,\u201d Mr. Reveles said.The availability of this technology presents lots of questions. One obvious one: Can\u2019t authorities abuse the technology and use it to trace people they believe are guilty of crimes unrelated to sexual exploitation?Ms. Cordua said the technology the organization uses already exists in some capacity. However, no one has made the concentrated effort to use it to fight issues like human trafficking and child and adolescent sexual abuse, because there\u2019s no money there.\u201cIf your customer is a child in distress and trauma and you have the technology, you don\u2019t really have the incentive to use it,\u201d Ms. Cordua said. \u201cWhat we wanted was to change the game.\u201dThorn has repurposed and is working to improve the same natural-language processing tools companies use to advertise the shoes you were interested in a few days ago, and the restaurant whose menu you browsed the other night on Facebook. Additionally, Thorn uses network analysis, similar to tools used in terrorism or fraud cases.\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at escort ads and someone is being sold, you want to know \u2018Is that person alone or are they maybe part of a group of five being controlled by the same trafficker?\u201d Ms. Cordua said.Central to much of Thorn\u2019s work is research done by medical professionals who have worked with victims as well as offenders. From that research, Thorn has experimented with warnings that appear in search engines when people search for child sex content.The strategies can vary depending on the audience: There are differences between someone who abuses a child; someone who abuses a child, documents it and shares it online; and someone who is trading abuse content but has never abused a child.\u201cThose insights affect a lot of our messaging,\u201d Ms. Cordua said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a someone who is consuming abuse content but you haven\u2019t abused a child yet, I want to get to you and get you to stop before it gets worse.\u201dIt would be a misconception to think that law enforcement personnel can push a button and come up with people to arrest (yet).\u201cThe last 100 yards are always human, but what we\u2019re trying to do is make it faster to find these kids and really to find a needle in the haystack,\u201d Ms. Cordua said.Mr. Kutcher, who testified about trafficking before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this year, has spent a lot of time thinking about how to best combat the abuse of technology by traffickers.\u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet, one-size fits all solution,\u201d Mr. Kutcher said. \u201cYou create a tool that helps law enforcement solve one issue, but then you have to build another tool to deal with another issue.\u201dMr. Kutcher said Thorn is the most fulfilling of his more than 150 investments. \u201cThis is the one I\u2019m most proud of,\u201d he said.slide showAdvertisement"}

With IMAP, even though you can see your mailbox in the mail program on your computer and devices, IMAP messages actually live on the mail server.

The mail apps on your other devices see the change when you view the updated mailbox.In contrast, most POP mail systems in their default settings download messages directly to the device that checks in at the time, and then deletes those messages from the mail server. When you check mail with your computer or other gadgets, those devices do not get the deleted messages, but they may download newer ones \u2014 which then get deleted from the server, making your mailboxes out of sync.As a workaround, some mail providers allow you to keep messages on the server without deleting them automatically after they download, but then you have to repeatedly delete a message on each device.

{"Headline": "Where the STEM Jobs Are (and Where They Aren\u2019t)", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe national priority in education can be summed up in a four-letter acronym: STEM. And that\u2019s understandable. A country\u2019s proficiency in science, technology, engineering and mathematics is vital in generating economic growth, advancing scientific innovation and creating good jobs.The STEM campaign has been underway for years, championed by policymakers across the ideological spectrum, embraced in schools everywhere and by organizations ranging from the YWCA to the Boy Scouts. By now, the term \u2014 first popularized and promoted by the National Science Foundation \u2014 is used as a descriptive identifier. \u201cShe\u2019s a STEM,\u201d usually meant as a compliment, suggests someone who has a leg up in the college admissions sweepstakes.Much of the public enthusiasm for STEM education rests on the assumption that these fields are rich in job opportunity. Some are, some aren\u2019t. STEM is an expansive category, spanning many disciplines and occupations, from software engineers and data scientists to geologists, astronomers and physicists.What recent studies have made increasingly apparent is that the greatest number of high-paying STEM jobs are in the \u201cT\u201d (specifically, computing).\u201cThere is a huge divide between the computing technology roles and the traditional sciences,\u201d said Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor\u2019s chief economist.In a recent analysis, Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, focused on the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment forecasts in STEM categories. In the decade ending in 2024, 73 percent of STEM job growth will be in computer occupations, but only 3 percent will be in the physical sciences and 3 percent in the life sciences.A working grasp of the principles of science and math should be essential knowledge for all Americans, said Michael S. Teitelbaum, an expert on science education and policy. But he believes that STEM advocates, often executives and lobbyists for technology companies, do a disservice when they raise the alarm that America is facing a worrying shortfall of STEM workers, based on shortages in a relative handful of fast-growing fields like data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and computer security.\u201cWhen it gets generalized to all of STEM, it\u2019s misleading,\u201d said Mr. Teitelbaum, a senior research associate in the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School. \u201cWe\u2019re misleading a lot of young people.\u201dIf physicists and biologists want to enjoy the boom times in the digital economy, a few specialist start-ups will train them and find them jobs as data scientists and artificial intelligence programmers.Carlos Faham made that passage. He had an impressive academic career, with a string of grant awards and fellowships. His Ph.D. from Brown University was in dark-matter physics. After Brown, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.Dr. Faham loved the research, but after nearly two years he was feeling the strain of that life. By then, he had spent 12 years in college, graduate school and postgraduate research. His next step would be to compete for a handful of tenure-track teaching openings across the country. For the pricey Bay Area, he wasn\u2019t making enough. A postdoc researcher typically makes $40,000 to $60,000 a year.Dr. Faham had done serious programming for his physics research. He applied to tech companies, figuring they would be eager to hire someone with his intellectual firepower. He couldn\u2019t get an in-person interview. He was told his background was too academic. He fumbled a couple of phone screening interviews because the statistical and machine-learning problems were unfamiliar to him.\u201cIt was like hitting a wall running at full speed, really humbling,\u201d he recalled.Dr. Faham joined the seven-week Insight Data Science Fellows program in 2015. There was no formal course work. Other than a few tutorials by industry people, the time was spent creating a product \u2014 his was software for recognizing and tracking faces in video \u2014 and training for interviews. That involved solving a programming problem on a white board and explaining his thinking. \u201cInterviewing is a muscle and you have to exercise it again and again,\u201d he said. After the program, he received six job offers. He accepted the offer from LinkedIn. (Insight is free for participants; hiring companies pay an undisclosed fee.)Today, Dr. Faham, 33, is a senior data scientist, working on a team that uses machine learning and statistical models to detect illicit activity on the social network, including fake job listings, ad fraud, spam and bot attacks.The range of data-intensive detective work, he said, is \u201cextremely rich\u201d and \u201cit moves so much faster than my previous world.\u201d He makes a \u201cpretty good six-figure salary,\u201d about five times what he did as a postdoctoral researcher.About 90 percent of those who enter the Insight program have landed jobs as data analysts, the company says, with a dropout rate of about 3 percent.Anasuya Das made a similar career move, but not one as far from her academic training. After the program, Dr. Das, whose Ph.D. is in neuroscience, joined the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she is now a senior data scientist. She works on a team that creates software tools for the center\u2019s doctors, nurses and researchers. One current project is a program to recommend the most promising clinical trials for individual cancer patients, based on their medical histories, age, gender and genetics.Data science is distinctly different from neuroscience, Dr. Das said, but some of the tools she employs, like a machine-learning technique called artificial neural networks, do take their inspiration from the brain. Her experience points to the larger trend that digital technologies like data science and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in nearly every discipline. So technology and the other STEM fields merge.That is the thinking behind a new division of data sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, that started in July. The division is a response to student demand and advancing technology. Berkeley\u2019s \u201cFoundations of Data Science\u201d course attracted 1,200 students from more than 50 majors in the last academic year.The choice of the term \u201cdivision\u201d rather than \u201cinstitute,\u201d explained David Culler, the interim dean for data sciences, underlines its approach. \u201cWe want this to be something foundational across the university, innovating with other disciplines, not differentiating from them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the academic world mirroring what is happening in the larger economy.\u201dSteve Lohr is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foiling Cyberspies on Business Trips", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe admonitions to business travelers headed to other countries should be familiar by now: Keep your laptop with you at all times. Stay off public Wi-Fi networks. Don\u2019t send unencrypted files over the internet.But not all travelers are heeding them, and many are unaware of the foreign hackers and state-sponsored spies who are taking advantage of their lax security practices.The theft of technical product specifications, investment plans, research on mergers and acquisitions, marketing plans and other information can have consequences beyond loss of revenue and market position, Ms. Ravich told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this year. She described potential large-scale effects of state-sponsored economic warfare, which, she said, could disrupt the delivery of items crucial for manufacturing, malware incidents that could disrupt travel and cyberattacks that could force companies to shut down their websites.The problem of intellectual property theft is not new, but it is now much more widespread. \u201cPlacing listening devices in conference rooms, hotels and restaurants is traditional Espionage 101,\u201d Ms. Ravich said. But with tools like tiny inexpensive cameras and microphones or compromised Wi-Fi networks, corporate or state-sponsored industrial espionage \u201ccan be done cheaply and at scale,\u201d she said.Multiple microphones in a conference center, for instance, can be recording constantly, and those recordings can be fed into natural language processing software trained to flag certain words and report those conversations. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a guy with headphones listening in the next room anymore,\u201d Ms. Ravich said.Communicating over the internet while overseas can be especially fraught, said Nicole Miller, an independent consultant in San Francisco who helps companies communicate with employees and customers on cybersecurity issues. \u201cAssume any data, any information you transmit can be taken by a hacker, nation-state or another business,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are not pedestrian tools they are using. They are extremely sophisticated.\u201dPhysical security of phones, tablets and laptops is as important as cyberprotection, Ms. Miller said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave your laptop or papers in your hotel room when you go out,\u201d she said. A hotel room safe should not even be considered secure.Ms. Miller said she advised travelers to create complex passwords for their devices and all of their online accounts, to use two-factor authentication whenever possible and to avoid plugging other people\u2019s USB drives or other external hardware into their computers.Laptops should also be wiped clean of any data and software at the end of the trip, she said. \u201cYour device could have been altered, your data could have been altered,\u201d without your realizing it, Ms. Miller said.Sometimes circumstances beyond travelers\u2019 control expose their information, as when customs officers in another country seize a person\u2019s device and copy its contents, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why any information not absolutely required for a trip should remain at the office,\u201d Ms. Miller said.Stanford University and Microsoft are among educational institutions and companies that supply comprehensive precaution and instruction lists to their employees who travel abroad.Maureen Sharma travels regularly to Asia as part of her work for Mullally International, a small product development company in Seattle. Some unsettling incidents, she said, have made her more cautious when she travels abroad.\u201cI often get more spam and strange emails that look like they are from me with attachments,\u201d when returning from her business trips. Once, Ms. Sharma said, she received an email that looked as if it were from a Chinese factory she was working with, asking her to send the next payment to a new bank account. \u201cLuckily, I called to confirm, because the factory had not sent that email,\u201d she said.Ms. Sharma said she makes sure never to bring sensitive information on her laptop and changes all her passwords every time she returns home from any trip abroad.Of course, listening, spying and hacking can happen no matter who owns a hotel or where a meeting is. \u201cThe internet has no borders,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cYou could be hacked in another country or the U.S., and you have no idea where that person is.\u201dMs. Ravich agreed. \u201cThere is a glaring disconnect between how critical this is, and how seriously people take it,\u201d she said. One reason is that the theft of information, data or plans may go unnoticed, unlike the theft of a physical laptop. It is also hard to connect a cyberattack on a company to a specific trip taken by a specific employee.Companies need to place better controls on the hardware they issue, like laptops and cellphones, Ms. Ravich said, so the devices automatically send only encrypted data, require strong passwords and use cellular connections rather than the local Wi-Fi. To really improve or \u201charden\u201d cybersecurity for business travelers, she said, companies need to take human behavior out of the equation.Advertisement"}

An analyst at Goldman Sachs just published a research note putting the odds of Republicans changing the tax code at more than 80 percent. But Republicans in the Senate have added a wrinkle: repealing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate at the same time. More on that in a moment.Remember that a White House spokesman previously told the NYT, \u201cThe President did not speak with the Attorney General about this matter, and no White House official was authorized to speak with the Department of Justice on this matter.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London.____________________________From a note just published by Alec Phillips, a political economist at the firm:The tax reform debate is moving forward faster than we or most other observers expected. While there are a number of issues that could still slow it down, or stop it altogether, we believe the odds that tax reform will be enacted by early 2018 \u2014 already our base case \u2014 have risen to 80% (from 65% previously).He added that there\u2019s a one-in-three chance of a tax change becoming law by the end of the year, though the House and Senate may need time to reconcile their bills.While Mr. Phillips thinks that Republicans\u2019 tax efforts still face obstacles, including intense lobbying efforts and questions about whether the Senate can pass its bill, he believes that the overall campaign will succeed.Among some of Mr. Phillips\u2019 other predictions:\u2022 The corporate tax rate appears likely to go down to 20 percent, but may need to be phased in.\u2022 Limits on deductions for corporate interest payments should follow the more lenient prescription set out in the House bill.\u2022 Fewer Republicans than expected will ultimately push back against limits on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT in Congressional parlance.\u2014 MichaelSenator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, had pushed for the mandate to be eliminated as part of the tax bill. Here\u2019s what he had to say:\u201cRepealing the mandate pays for more tax cuts for working families and protects them from being fined by the I.R.S. for not being able to afford insurance that Obamacare made unaffordable in the first place.\u201dMr. El-Erian has the qualifications: former C.E.O. of Pimco, currently chief economic adviser at Allianz. But he\u2019s also what some of President Trump\u2019s backers would consider a \u201cglobalist,\u201d from his international upbringing as the son of an Egyptian diplomat to his economic views, which generally mesh well with the departing Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen.President Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve is a very wise decision that will be welcomed by markets. It brings a highly respected, well-informed and experienced professional to the helm of the world\u2019s most powerful central bank.\u2014 MichaelThe S.E.C. filed a total of 62 new enforcement actions against public companies and their subsidiaries in the fiscal year, down from 92 the previous fiscal year.Of the 62 actions, only 17 were brought in the second half of the year.Trian Partners probably wishes you didn\u2019t.At the time Trian published its analysis, G.E. was trading at $25.47.

{"Headline": "As Silicon Valley Gets \u2018Crazy,\u2019 Midwest Beckons Tech Investors", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey are by no means the only notable investors seeking opportunity in the region.Four years ago, Mark Kvamme, a top venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, left the heart of the tech industry to become a tech investor here in the Midwest heartland.\u201cSilicon Valley is kind of crazy now,\u201d Mr. Kvamme said.The money, power and influence of tech companies on the West Coast have reached new heights. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are now the four most valuable companies in the country.But some investors, led by people like Mr. Kvamme and his firm, Drive Capital, see plenty of potential in the center of the country. Focusing on the Midwest is no longer considered a nutty idea, as it was by skeptical West Coast venture capitalists when Mr. Kvamme and Chris Olsen, another Silicon Valley transplant from Sequoia Capital and co-founder of Drive Capital, made the move in 2013.Every major Midwestern city now has clusters of start-up accelerators and incubators, typically housed in renovated red-brick industrial buildings.Deals like those are still rare. But local entrepreneurs and big investors are scouting the Midwest for start-up investments that range up to tens of millions of dollars, far more than local angel and venture investors. And they are beginning to attract venture capital from Silicon Valley for follow-on rounds of funding.The rationale for investing in the Midwest combines cost and opportunity. A top-flight software engineer who is paid $100,000 a year in the Midwest might well command $200,000 or more in the Bay Area. The Midwest, the optimists say, also has ample tech talent, with excellent engineers coming out of major state and private universities in the region.But they also point to technology shifts. As technology transforms nontech industries like health care, agriculture, transportation, finance and manufacturing, the Midwest investors argue that being close to customers will be more important than being close to the wellspring of technology.\u201cThe value will come from marrying industry knowledge with technology,\u201d said Mr. Olsen of Drive Capital. \u201cThere\u2019s an arrogance in Silicon Valley that we don\u2019t need industry expertise. That\u2019s going to be less and less true in the future.\u201d\u201cThere are two Americas,\u201d Mr. Case said. \u201cOne with an abundance of capital and opportunity \u2014 in Silicon Valley and pockets around the nation. But not in the other America, and that other America is most of the country.\u201dMr. Case served on White House advisory councils on jobs, innovation and entrepreneurship during the Obama administration, and that experience, he said, shaped his thinking about investing in the Midwest. Since 2011, his firm has raised more than $1 billion for two funds, Revolution Ventures and Revolution Growth, which generally make investments of $4 million to $50 million, including in start-ups in the Midwest.Both Mr. Case and Mr. Vance, whose career path went through the Marines, Ohio State University and Yale Law School and then to a Silicon Valley venture firm, view building businesses as a social virtue as well.Referring to the troubles chronicled in his book, Mr. Vance said that \u201cat least a partial solution is to get more investment capital into this part of the country.\u201dThe firm also sponsors road trips in a colorfully painted bus that it calls Rise of the Rest, also the name of Revolution\u2019s new $100 million investment fund. Mr. Case and members of his team leave Revolution\u2019s base in Washington, D.C., to visit and champion emerging start-up communities in cities across the country. Since 2014, there have been six such tours, and the most recent one ended last month after stops in central Pennsylvania; Ann Arbor, Mich.; Indianapolis; Columbus; and Green Bay, Wis.The days are packed with meetings with local entrepreneurs, investors, corporate executives, government officials, educators and social service workers. Each day ends with a pitch contest, where eight to 10 start-ups present their companies and business plans.The winner in each city receives a check for $100,000, a personal investment from Mr. Case. So far, he has handed out more than $4 million in the local contests.The day in Columbus was typical. There were seven stops, including three start-up hubs, with Mr. Case and Mr. Vance listening and speaking at each location.Mr. Case and Mr. Vance talk of the need to create \u201cnetwork density\u201d by bringing together more entrepreneurs, customers, partners and investment capital. The trips can and do yield investment candidates for Revolution, but start-up evangelism is the main theme.In Ohio, that $35 million is the equivalent of $70 million in the Valley in terms of being able to hire talent and sustain operating costs, said Sean Lane, CrossChx\u2019s co-founder and chief executive.\u201cI\u2019m not sure we would have made it through the zigs and zags if we were in the Valley,\u201d Mr. Lane said.CrossChx is one of more than two dozen companies in Drive Capital\u2019s portfolio. To date, none have folded, and they are generating more than $150 million in revenue. After three years \u2014 its first fund started investing in 2014 \u2014 the firm\u2019s gains look good on paper. But it is too early to declare its Midwest bet a success.That will take a few more years, and the proof will be if it delivers high returns to its limited-partner investors. \u201cAnd if two guys from Silicon Valley and Sequoia can\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Olsen said, \u201ccapital isn\u2019t going to come here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the eyes of their critics, they have become too big, too powerful and too unmindful of their influence. And this week\u2019s congressional hearings cast added and unflattering light on the industry\u2019s growing embarrassment over the Russian election meddling.\u201cWithout sufficient oversight, these companies never imagined hostile intelligence services would misuse their platforms in this way,\u201d said Renee DiResta, an independent security researcher at Data for Democracy. \u201cThe people running it appear to not fully appreciate what they\u2019ve designed.\u201dNot surprisingly, perhaps, a few of the industry\u2019s biggest companies have been happy to say, in essence, don\u2019t blame us.Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive and an outspoken critic of the data-collection practices of his company\u2019s technological rivals, said Wednesday that he was concerned that social networks could be weaponized against the people who use them.With the emergence of Facebook, Twitter and their ilk over the last decade, \u201csocial\u201d became a key Silicon Valley buzzword as companies crammed social network-like features into new products. Even Apple, despite the tens of billions of dollars it has earned making computing devices, has tried its hand at a social network focused on music.But as social media has become increasingly connected to unpleasant bickering, race-baiting and Russian propaganda, the must-have \u201csocial\u201d label has become an albatross, said Joseph Bayer, an assistant professor at Ohio State University who focuses on social networks.\u201cThe mere fact that a tech company is trying to minimize its overall influence is a telling signal of the moment we\u2019re in,\u201d said Mr. Bayer.Google, which operates under the parent company Alphabet, can offer a distinction between its business and how social networks operate \u2014 largely because its attempts to build a social network have not been very successful.The company spent millions of dollars creating Google+, a social site built specifically to take on Facebook. The company tied Google+ into nearly every one of its properties, describing it as the \u201csocial spine\u201d of Google in public statements at the time.There also were short-lived efforts like Google Buzz and Google Wave, or geographically specific sites like Orkut \u2014 popular in Brazil but ignored elsewhere.Google+ continues to exist but it is considered a disappointment. Google said it had found no political posts from state-linked actors on Google+.Google said accounts believed to have ties to the Kremlin had uploaded more than 1,100 videos to YouTube on racial, religious and political topics. Those videos were viewed 309,000 times. Many of those videos had only a small number of views, though they were \u201cfrequently posted to other social media platforms,\u201d Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s senior counsel in law enforcement and information security, told a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday.Facebook, to offer a comparison, estimated that 150 million users of Facebook and its subsidiary, Instagram, had been exposed to 80,000 posts that came from the Russian influence campaign.Twitter said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts that were linked to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, a company tied to the Kremlin, between September 2016 and November 2016. Those accounts posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period. Twitter identified an additional 36,000 automated accounts that had posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that same period. The tweets received about 288 million views.\u201cNow you\u2019re seeing all the attention from Congress go to Facebook and Twitter, because they\u2019re the linchpin\u201d of the Russian information operations, said Ms. DiResta, the security researcher.In his testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, sought to draw a bright line separating his company\u2019s services from social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which has been an occasional subject of Google acquisition rumors.He also played down what Google knows about its users, a surprising conceit for a company that makes more money than anybody from selling advertising based on the online interests of users.\u201cWe\u2019re somewhat differently positioned because we\u2019re not primarily a social network,\u201d Mr. Walker said in response to a question regarding whether Google should notify users who are exposed to propaganda or divisive content from a foreign government. \u201cMany users are not logged in when they access content, so it\u2019s difficult to know who sees what.\u201dStill, social media remains a compelling proposition for internet companies, even Google, because it keeps people coming back and creates a place for them to spend their time, said Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology data firm Jackdaw Research.\u201cIf you gave Google the choice of having a social network, even with everything that\u2019s happened,\u201d said Mr. Dawson. \u201cI think it would still like to have one.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now the United States agency says it is satisfied with Zimbabwe\u2019s actions and believes such hunts can be beneficial for the species by bringing money to local communities and providing incentives to conserve elephants.\u201cSince our 2014 and 2015 findings, there are strong indications that the efforts of private landowners and consortiums to manage elephants within their areas of control have received greater support,\u201d the federal agency said in a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Friday.The Zimbabwean government, it added, was contributing to efforts to combat poaching and working with partners to improve elephant management.The reversal of the ban comes less than two weeks after the agency moved to allow imports from Zambia. Both decisions generally apply to elephants hunted in either country between 2016 and 2018. Hunters are allowed two imports per year.That project found that Zambia and Zimbabwe have had mixed success in maintaining or growing their elephant populations. Parks near countries with poor elephant preservation efforts were not doing well, for example. But elephant populations elsewhere were stable or increasing.Trophy tourism in Africa has come under high-profile scrutiny in recent years.The group had joined the National Rifle Association in suing the federal government over the 2014 ban and said that it would continue to challenge that decision so hunters can retrieve trophies from hunts that are still excluded.\u201cWhat kind of message does it send to say to the world that poor Africans who are struggling to survive cannot kill elephants in order to use or sell their parts to make a living, but that it\u2019s just fine for rich Americans to slay the beasts for their tusks to keep as trophies?\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}

They get to people.\u201dAides said it was no more complicated than that. The president likes elephants, they said. He did not know about his administration\u2019s decision to lift the trophy ban until learning it from the news media and was annoyed to be criticized for a move he had no part in. So he made his displeasure known in the way he has so many other times this year, through his Twitter feed.As it happened, his decision also coincided with the sentiments of conservative media personalities like Michael Savage, Laura Ingraham and Mike Cernovich, who have defended Mr. Trump through a cascade of controversies this year but protested the administration\u2019s initial announcement.\u201cThe ruling was absurd,\u201d Ms. Ingraham, the Fox News host who has been considered for a job in the Trump administration, said on Monday. \u201cWho could ever shoot these majestic creatures?\u201d Ms. Ingraham called herself \u201ca conservationist\u201d who has been to Botswana three times, including this past summer with her children.Mr. Trump is not a hunter, unlike his sons Donald Jr. and Eric. In 2012, photographs were posted online of the two men posing with several dead animals during a safari in Zimbabwe, including one that showed Donald Trump Jr. holding a knife in one hand and a severed elephant tail in the other.Lara Trump, Eric\u2019s wife, on the other hand, has become a vocal animal rights advocate and the Humane Society of the United States said she brought up the elephant trophy issue during meetings on Capitol Hill last Thursday. She and her husband visited the White House on Friday, but advisers to the president said they did not know whether the issue came up.On the other side, the National Rifle Association, another supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s, had hailed the lifting of the ban, calling it \u201ca significant step forward in having hunting receive the recognition it deserves as a tool of sound wildlife management.\u201dIt was not the first time Mr. Trump has announced an unexpected policy shift via Twitter but wildlife service veterans could not remember a president stepping in so late in the process.\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented, especially once it\u2019s been published in the Federal Register Service,\u201d said Dan Ashe, the former director of the Fish and Wildlife Service who stepped down in January after 22 years with the agency. \u201cIt puts the Fish and Wildlife Service in an awkward procedural position.\u201dMr. Ashe, now president of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said he was surprised not only at the president\u2019s intervention but at the timing of the agency\u2019s recommendation.\u201cThis administration has not yet found a voice on the wildlife trafficking epidemic, which is what is driving elephants and other animals into extinction,\u201d Mr. Ashe said. \u201cI would\u2019ve hoped, and maybe expected, that they would have first found a voice on the larger issue of wildlife trafficking before they ventured into trophy hunting.\u201dIndeed, the uncertainty generated by the president\u2019s involvement prompted a lawsuit on Monday by two environmental groups, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Natural Resources Defense Council, citing confusion over the administration\u2019s position. Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet may only suspend permit evaluation without putting the ban back in place, they said.\u201cPutting trophy imports \u2018on hold\u2019 isn\u2019t enough,\u201d said Elly Pepper, deputy director of wildlife trade for the resources council. \u201cIf we don\u2019t force the administration to completely revoke its decision, President Trump could quietly start allowing these imports as soon as he stops facing criticism on Twitter.\u201dThe other side of the debate rallied as well. The Safari Club International sent out a \u201ccall to arms\u201d last weekend, asking more than 50,000 members to lobby Mr. Trump and Mr. Zinke to stand by the decision to lift the ban, blaming the \u201cshrill, negative reactions\u201d of anti-hunters and media outlets.\u201cYou don\u2019t hear a lot of hunters stepping out,\u201d said Paul Babaz, the organization\u2019s president. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage hunters to step out, to have a voice.\u201dJeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "5 Lessons Seattle Can Teach Other Cities About Amazon", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon, the colossus of internet commerce that was founded here, is conducting the most dramatic sweepstakes of modern capitalism in throwing open a competition for a coequal second headquarters. The company has promised to create about 50,000 new jobs at HQ2, as Amazon is calling it, paralleling the similar number the company plans to employ here over the next couple of years.Six-figure salaries, real-estate investments and economic ripple effects \u2014 from health care for all those new workers to the hash browns being served for breakfast \u2014 could inject $50 billion or more into the winning town, economists say. Proposals from 43 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, as well as Canada and Mexico, are now being considered, with a decision scheduled for sometime next year.For Seattle, Amazon has become far more than a big employer and taxpayer. It reshaped how the city sees itself and, in turn, is seen by the world. It created a vast, gleaming new campus in a once derelict corner of the city, but also raised deep concerns about housing costs, traffic congestion and potential over-dependence on one corporation.In interviews with experts and residents, from tech company offices to chambers of commerce, here are the lessons from Seattle for all those cities now seeking the Amazon prize.The second Amazon headquarters will unquestionably have a major impact on whichever city gets the nod. But Amazon did not start from scratch.A collective corporate cultural ethos had been built as well by other companies that arose from a city of working waterfronts and gloomy skies. REI, Eddie Bauer, Starbucks, Nordstrom and Costco \u2014 not to mention Microsoft and Boeing \u2014 shaped the economic rootstock that Amazon grew from, and created an assumption by many Seattle residents that corporations should be involved in the community as civic leaders.\u201cThere isn\u2019t an obvious candidate where they\u2019re going to get the same confluence of features,\u201d said Fred H. Smith, a professor of urban economic history at Davidson College in North Carolina, who has evaluated the bid by his state\u2019s leading HQ2 contender, Charlotte.Seattle hit a sweet spot with the company\u2019s rise, Professor Smith said, as Amazon tapped into an existing rich pool of talent and resources, from the University of Washington\u2019s strengths in computer science, to cheap electricity from the Pacific Northwest\u2019s connections to hydropower dams in the Columbia River basin.\u201cFinding a city that has all of those things is a tough goal,\u201d he said.A company that started out selling books became one of the inventors of cloud computing as a business, selling not just goods but the invisible machinery of internet commerce itself. It has leapt into the grocery business with the recent acquisition of Whole Foods. It made a decision that employees could bring their dogs to work, and on any given day, about 1,200 pets are roaming the 33 buildings of the urban campus in the South Lake Union area.The message to HQ2 cities is clear: What you get now will probably not be what Amazon becomes.Change and churn have become part of the Amazon brand, and thus the Seattle brand, business people said. In the past seven years, coinciding with Amazon\u2019s biggest growth spurt, the number of Fortune 500 companies with an office in Seattle quadrupled, to 31 from seven, many of them hunkering down as closely as they can to Amazon.\u201cThere\u2019s an ecosystem that has been really enhanced because of Amazon,\u201d said Josh Simms, the chief executive of H5 Data Centers, a company based in Los Angeles that provides space for cloud-computing companies. \u201cAmazon brought a lot of young, smart people into Seattle, so now all the big tech companies feel they need to be there as well,\u201d he said.Critics still complain that Amazon is not involved enough as a corporate citizen. But one of the company\u2019s new office buildings will have a shelter for 200 homeless women, children and families built into the tower itself \u2014 the first such design in the world, company officials said.\u201cI still look at Amazon as a young company, a teenager,\u201d said Maud Daudon, the president of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThey\u2019re on a path.\u201dIn Seattle, the company\u2019s growth became the catalyst for forces of anti-growth as housing prices soared and traffic worsened. The nation\u2019s first big-city $15-an-hour wage was passed here as Amazon rose. Home prices have risen faster in recent years than in any place in America.\u201cAmazon is simultaneously one of the most loved and most hated of organizations. It\u2019s this incredibly schizophrenic relationship,\u201d said David Rolf, the president of the Service Employees International Union 775, which represents 45,000 health care workers.Defenders of the company\u2019s impact said the huge and expensive expansion of mass transit that is underway now might not have happened if a sudden worsening of traffic had not underscored the need; voters rejected transit expansions multiple times here in the past.Others, like Will Martin, an architect who was walking on a recent morning near his office downtown, worry that the city could become too much of a one-company town, the way it felt in the old days when Boeing would sneeze and the city would pull up the blankets and stay in bed.Brace for a transformation of housing, demography and consumer demand. Here in Seattle, a city still defined by neighborhoods of single-family homes, about 8,000 new apartments are under construction within walking distance of the Amazon campus and are expected to be taken, the company says, mostly by employees. About 20 percent of the company\u2019s 40,000 workers already do not take any motorized transportation at all \u2014 they walk or bike. And more than one in six live and work in the same ZIP code.\u201cAll of a sudden you\u2019re going to get 50,000 requests \u2014 why is the Wi-Fi not faster around here?\u201d said Mike Metzger, the chief executive at Payscale, a wage-analytics company that was founded in Seattle by three executives from Microsoft, and now has dozens of former Amazon workers in its 450-person work force.Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said the stresses and opportunities are combined.\u201cOther cities would kill to have the problems that Seattle has,\u201d he said. The priority, in his view, should be preserving the elements that allowed and encouraged Amazon to put down seeds and grow. \u201cWhat we want to do is maintain the culture that attracted Bezos in the first place,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "LinkedIn Faces Setback in China as It Runs Afoul of New Rules", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 LinkedIn is often held up as a model of how a foreign internet company can do business in China. Increasingly, it also serves as an example of how difficult that task can be.This week, the jobs-and-professional-networking service blocked individuals from advertising jobs on its site in China, after it ran afoul of new government regulations requiring it to verify the individuals\u2019 identities, according to a person familiar with the situation. LinkedIn said in a statement that companies could still post job listings but that it did not know when it would again allow individuals to do the same.In August, China\u2019s government increased scrutiny on internet job postings in response to a rash of online hiring scams, mostly for pyramid schemes. New regulations call for companies to have verification of the identities of those posting job listings.Beijing has been following up its new regulation with audits, according to the person, who asked not to be named because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.But in recent months, Beijing has ratcheted up its already strict internet controls, and such an approach to managing the web takes its toll on companies.After being forced to borrow hundreds of dollars from family and friends, Mr. Li drowned himself in a small pond along a highway on the outskirts of Tianjin, a port city near Beijing.His death was one of several since the summer, which has spurred an uproar across the country and prompted a government-led crackdown on pyramid schemes.The company has struggled to become a major player there. In part, that is because of China\u2019s unique internet culture. While hiring sites are popular, many people opt to manage their professional contacts in the country\u2019s most popular social network, WeChat.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Case for Removing Extremist Videos From the Internet", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsIn December 2015, a search for \u201cAnwar al-Awlaki\u201d on YouTube yielded nearly 60,000 results for his sermons and lectures. By last August, there were more than 70,000 results. An hourlong polemic by Mr. Awlaki demonizing the United States titled \u201cBattle of the Hearts and Minds\u201d had more than 80,000 views and 700 likes.The removal of this online content will ultimately save lives. There are at least 90 instances in which extremists in the United States and Europe were shown to have had ties to or been influenced by Mr. Awlaki, including the Fort Hood gunman, Nidal Hassan; the \u201cunderwear bomber,\u201d Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab; the Charlie Hebdo attackers Sa\u00efd and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi; Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in Orlando, Fla.; and the Boston Marathon bombers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev.YouTube\u2019s recent action was a significant step in a new direction, but now more must be done. Mr. Awlaki\u2019s content should be removed from all other Google sites, including the file-sharing platform Google Drive. Other internet companies, large and small, should look to YouTube\u2019s example and follow suit.Recently, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube established the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism to share information and best practices about how to counter the threat of terrorist content online. A zero-tolerance policy regarding Mr. Awlaki and similar figures would be a model for other companies.In that same vein, industrywide standards are needed to ensure the timely and permanent removal of dangerous content, especially when produced by groups and individuals on the State Department\u2019s Foreign Terrorist Organizations list, the Treasury Department\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list, and the United Nations Security Council Sanctions list, and individuals with demonstrable links to violence.There is no shortage of extremists online \u2014 Turki al-Binali, Abdullah Faisal, Yusuf al-Qaradawi and Ahmad Musa Jibril are notable examples. They must be subject to the same treatment and their content should be swiftly and permanently removed.YouTube\u2019s acknowledgment of the harmful impact of the Awlaki sermons should also open the door to a broader and more consistent approach against the content posted by the Islamic State online.The group\u2019s sophisticated exploitation of the internet to spread its message must be matched by a systematic and resource-intensive effort that includes website hosting companies such as WordPress, encrypted communications platforms such as Telegram and file-sharing platforms such as JustPaste.it, apart from video platforms such as YouTube.Killing terrorists is only half the battle, as the case of Mr. Awlaki has clearly shown. A new focus on combating extremist and terrorist ideologies online, through company policies, industrywide standards and technology, will be paramount in keeping the public safe.Mark Wallace, the chief executive of the Counter Extremism Project, was an ambassador to the United Nations in the George W. Bush administration. Frances Fragos Townsend, the president of the project, led the Homeland Security Council from 2004 to 2008.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Internet Is Dying. Repealing Net Neutrality Hastens That Death.", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe internet is dying.Sure, technically, the internet still works. Pull up Facebook on your phone and you will still see your second cousin\u2019s baby pictures. But that isn\u2019t really the internet. It\u2019s not the open, anyone-can-build-it network of the 1990s and early 2000s, the product of technologies created over decades through government funding and academic research, the network that helped undo Microsoft\u2019s stranglehold on the tech business and gave us upstarts like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix.Because net neutrality shelters start-ups \u2014 which can\u2019t easily pay for fast-line access \u2014 from internet giants that can pay, the rules are just about the last bulwark against the complete corporate takeover of much of online life. When the rules go, the internet will still work, but it will look like and feel like something else altogether \u2014 a network in which business development deals, rather than innovation, determine what you experience, a network that feels much more like cable TV than the technological Wild West that gave you Napster and Netflix.The five most valuable American companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 control much of the online infrastructure, from app stores to operating systems to cloud storage to nearly all of the online ad business. A handful of broadband companies \u2014 AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon, many of which are also aiming to become content companies, because why not \u2014 provide virtually all the internet connections to American homes and smartphones.Together these giants have carved the internet into a historically profitable system of fiefs. They have turned a network whose very promise was endless innovation into one stuck in mud, where every start-up is at the tender mercy of some of the largest corporations on the planet.The internet\u2019s singular power, in its early gold-rush days, was its flexibility. People could imagine a dazzling array of new uses for the network, and as quick as that, they could build and deploy them \u2014 a site that sold you books, a site that cataloged the world\u2019s information, an application that let you \u201cborrow\u201d other people\u2019s music, a social network that could connect you to anyone.You didn\u2019t need permission for any of this stuff; some of these innovations ruined traditional industries, some fundamentally altered society, and many were legally dubious. But the internet meant you could just put it up, and if it worked, the rest of the world would quickly adopt it.But if flexibility was the early internet\u2019s promise, it was soon imperiled. In 2003, Tim Wu, a law professor now at Columbia Law School (he\u2019s also a contributor to The New York Times), saw signs of impending corporate control over the growing internet. Broadband companies that were investing great sums to roll out faster and faster internet service to Americans were becoming wary of running an anything-goes network.Though it has been through a barrage of legal challenges and resurrections, some form of net neutrality has been the governing regime on the internet since 2005. The new F.C.C. order would undo the idea completely; companies would be allowed to block or demand payment for certain traffic as they liked, as long as they disclosed the arrangements.At the moment, broadband companies are promising not to act unfairly, and they argue that undoing the rules would give them further incentive to invest in their broadband capacity, ultimately improving the internet.Brian Hart, an F.C.C. spokesman, said broadband companies would still be covered by antitrust laws and other rules meant to prevent anticompetitive behavior. He noted that Mr. Pai\u2019s proposals would simply return the network to an earlier, pre-network-neutrality regulatory era.\u201cThe internet flourished under this framework before, and it will again,\u201d he said.Broadband companies are taking a similar line. When I pointed out to a Comcast spokeswoman that the company\u2019s promises were only voluntary \u2014 that nothing will prevent Comcast from one day creating special tiers of internet service with bundled content, much like the way it now sells cable TV \u2014 she suggested I was jumping the gun.Well, O.K. But a vibrant network doesn\u2019t die all at once. It takes time and neglect; it grows weaker by the day, but imperceptibly, so that one day we are living in a digital world controlled by giants and we come to regard the whole thing as normal.It\u2019s not normal. It wasn\u2019t always this way. The internet doesn\u2019t have to be a corporate playground. That\u2019s just the path we\u2019ve chosen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Skype Vanishes From App Stores in China, Including Apple\u2019s", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 One of the last foreign-run tools for online communication in China appears to be in trouble with the authorities here.For almost a month, Skype, the internet phone call and messaging service, has been unavailable on a number of sites where apps are downloaded in China, including Apple\u2019s app store in the country.\u201cWe have been notified by the Ministry of Public Security that a number of voice over internet protocol apps do not comply with local law. Therefore these apps have been removed from the app store in China,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said Tuesday in an emailed statement responding to questions about Skype\u2019s disappearance from the app store. \u201cThese apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201dThe removal led to a volley of complaints from Chinese users on internet message boards who were no longer able to pay for Skype\u2019s services through Apple. The users said that the disruption began in late October.Skype, which is owned by Microsoft, still functions in China, and its fate in the country is not yet clear. But its removal from the app stores is the most recent example of a decades-long push by China\u2019s government to control and monitor the flow of information online.While China has long wielded the most sophisticated and comprehensive internet controls in the world, under President Xi Jinping it has upped the ante, squelching most major foreign social networks and messaging apps one at a time.Beijing appears to have disabled these apps because they generally feature encryption options that make messages harder for the government to monitor. Such products also often run afoul of government rules that require the use of real-name identification for each and every account.A Microsoft spokesman said that Skype had been \u201ctemporarily removed\u201d from Apple\u2019s store and that the company was \u201cworking to reinstate the app as soon as possible.\u201d But the spokesman did not address Skype\u2019s absence from a variety of major third-party Android app stores. Because Google\u2019s services are largely blocked in China, Android users revert to alternate stores for downloads, and Skype\u2019s main app was not available on popular ones run by Chinese tech giants like Huawei and Xiaomi.But a key Chinese Communist Party meeting had already ended when Skype disappeared from the app stores \u2014 an indication that the cybersecurity law was the reason, and that the law, which began to take effect in June, is likely to have a deep and long-lasting impact on how the internet works in China. While the rules do not specifically ban foreign messaging apps, they do include general language that could be used to justify crackdowns.\u201cA broad reading of provisions in the law could be taken to mean that there is no longer support for allowing unfettered access to foreign communications tools such as Skype, WhatsApp, Signal and others that are outside the direct control of Chinese authorities,\u201d said Paul Triolo, the head of global technology at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.\u201cHence these also come under pressure, and are increasingly being throttled or blocked,\u201d he said.In that case, as in this one, it said that the apps violated Chinese rules and that it had taken them down to comply. Apple said this year that it planned to open a data center in China, also in response to China\u2019s new internet laws, which require that such centers be within the country\u2019s borders.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Prince\u2019s Uncertain Fate Deepens Mystery in Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookIt has been more than three weeks since Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the most prominent investor in Saudi Arabia, was arrested on a Saturday night as part of the sweeping detention of several dozen elites. Since then, he has been holed up inside the Saudi version of prison for the ultrawealthy: the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, about a 10-minute drive from the prince\u2019s home.He hasn\u2019t been heard from, nor have any charges against him been made public.Because he was the longtime public face of finance for Saudi Arabia, Prince Alwaleed\u2019s arrest \u2014 and the lack of transparency around what has happened to him \u2014 is causing increasing consternation among his various business partners and in much of the Western business community.His arrest has also created a sense of uncertainty among investors about whether to do business with Saudi Arabia and, by extension, could affect some of its partners, like Masayoshi Son\u2019s $100 billion SoftBank fund, in which the kingdom holds a 45 percent stake. It could also affect the highly anticipated public offering of the state-owned oil company, Aramco, planned for next year.\u201cI\u2019m surprised that he got swept up in this, because he had always been such a positive figure both in reality and symbolically for Saudi progressivism \u2014 for participating in the modern world, in modern finance,\u201d said Richard Parsons, a former chief executive of Time Warner and former chairman of Citigroup, in which the prince had also been a large investor.\u201cWhat is this all about?\u2019\u2019 Mr. Parsons added. \u201cThere is no transparency. Nobody understands what is going on. It is unclear why or what the rationale is. If you\u2019re an investor or a businessperson, you\u2019re going to take a step back from the starting line and say, \u2018I\u2019m just going to keep my money in my pocket.\u2019\u201dKnown as the Warren Buffett of the Middle East, the prince has worked with Bill Gates on various projects, including their ownership of the Four Seasons resorts and several philanthropic endeavors.\u201cI\u2019m only aware of what I\u2019ve read in the press, and I can\u2019t speculate,\u201d Mr. Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder, said by email. \u201cPrince Alwaleed has been an important partner in my foundation\u2019s work to ensure that kids around the world receive lifesaving vaccinations. We\u2019ve worked together to help stop the spread of polio, measles and other preventable diseases. His commitment to philanthropy is inspiring.\u201dThe Saudi Arabian government has officially described the arrest of Prince Alwaleed and dozens of other princes and businessmen as part of a long-planned \u201canticorruption\u201d effort. Inside the kingdom, the arrests were welcomed by many, especially by millennials, who think their job prospects and economic growth have been slowed by a culture of graft.But outside the country, questions remain. The arrests have been called everything from a power grab by the crown prince, to a shakedown, to a Saudi version of \u201cthe Saturday Night Massacre.\u201dStill, the kingdom expects to reach \u201csettlements\u201d with those who have been arrested, and the crown prince said he expected to recover $100 billion. It remains unclear where those who reach settlements will go after leaving the Ritz; some are expected to remain living in Saudi Arabia while others may leave the country.The arrest of Prince Alwaleed, however, has seemingly made some skittish and is likely to slow the pace of investment, at least in the short term.\u201cWhen people talk about where to invest outside of the U.S., you always hear the term \u2018rule of law,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Parsons, who was among a dozen or so American executives who spoke to me about their concerns, most asking for anonymity so as not to upset their relationship with the Saudis.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to take for granted if nothing untoward has happened or there hasn\u2019t been any turbulence,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as you see something that is difficult to understand in terms of how investors and investments are being treated, \u2018rule of law\u2019 all of sudden leaps up off the canvas.\u201dSeveral executives who do business in the kingdom said it wasn\u2019t the mass arrests of other public officials or elites that concerned them so much as the arrest of Prince Alwaleed himself. It put a prominent face on the unsettling news.His arrest has led to rampant speculation about the charges against him, with many questioning whether the kingdom might seek to take over his ownership of Rotana, the largest entertainment company in the region. The kingdom has sought more and more control over messaging, and Rotana owns television, film, music, magazine and radio assets.Some close to the prince privately question why, if he was under investigation, the government granted him permission to acquire a 16 percent stake in Saudi Fransi from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole for $1.5 billion in September \u2014 one of the largest finance deals in the country. The deal required the approval of regulators who would have surely known about the inquiry. The crown prince told Mr. Friedman that government had been working on the corruption cases for the past two years.Within the world of Silicon Valley, which the crown prince has been assiduously courting over the past several years \u2014 including a trip last year when he met with Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive \u2014 there are lingering questions about the implications of taking money from the country. Saudi Arabia took a direct stake in Uber, for example, and through its investment in Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund it has acquired pieces of companies like WeWork and Slack. Privately, some investors also grumble about the close ties that the Saudi government has with President Trump, an unpopular figure with many in Silicon Valley.Uber\u2019s new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, told me two weeks ago that the company had discussed whether to take the Saudi money. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there, but at the time when we took the money \u2014 because I asked the team about it \u2014 the company definitely talked about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say the most important issue for the company was the women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia.\u201dHe added: \u201cAnd the company explicitly talked about how we actually believe that women should be able to drive. And since then, the changes that we\u2019re seeing \u2014 the cultural changes that we\u2019re seeing in Saudi Arabia \u2014 they are unambiguously positive.\u201dWith some more transparency and answers about the fate of Prince Alwaleed, many more American business executives and investors would feel the same way.An earlier version of this article misidentified a former title of Richard Parsons. He was the former chairman of Citigroup, not the former chief executive.Advertisement"}

They do, however, reward the wealthy. Among the worst offenders is the proposed corporate tax cut, which is larger than needed and does nothing to make the system more efficient. The victims here are the economy as a whole and the workers and ordinary folk to whom Mr. Trump promised relief.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time to Talk Turkey About Thanksgiving Films", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingIn these ultra-anxious times, we might find ourselves looking ever more forward to the happier times of year. That may be why the Hallmark Channel started advertising its coming Christmas movies well before Halloween, let alone Thanksgiving, and is showing them now.The movie I most associate with Thanksgiving is the 1933 original of \u201cKing Kong.\u201d The film itself has no thematic connection to the season, but on Thanksgiving Day the New York television station WOR/Channel 9 aired it every year without fail. As a movie-mad youngster I lived for this broadcast. I got even more excited when the station added \u201cSon of Kong\u201d and \u201cMighty Joe Young\u201d to the mix and, as I got into my teens, Japanese monster movies like, yes, \u201cKing Kong vs. Godzilla.\u201d (My memory is such that I might be conflating movies that played the day after Thanksgiving with those that played on the holiday proper, but it is a four-day weekend after all.) Soon enough, the adults in the room had tired of indulging me and took back the television to use it as God intended on Thanksgiving, which is to watch football.The movie is streaming \u2014 supposedly \u2014 on the app of the cable channel Starz. I normally gain access to this app through my cable provider user ID and password, but when I tried to watch the film that way on my iPad, a black screen and a message, in a very elegant typeface, appeared instead: \u201cFirst, a quick piece of business: While you now have access to tons of your favorite stuff, this title isn\u2019t offered by your provider. We\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll find more of the obsessable series and movies that you crave.\u201d Let the subscriber beware. I was able to watch \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles\u201d on Starz through Amazon Channels, and remind me to cancel that subscription before my seven-day free trial runs out (oops, too late now).The movie is brisk and consistently funny, and it hits the sentiment bone in a smart, relatively honest way. The slow-burn rage of Mr. Martin against the oblivious amiability of Mr. Candy (his character\u2019s signature line: \u201cThe last thing I want to be remembered as is an annoying blabbermouth\u201d) remains a spectacular comedic blend. As is customary with films written and directed by John Hughes in the 1980s, there\u2019s an American class-analysis subtext that holds the characterizations together: Mr. Martin\u2019s aspirational hauteur is the irresistible force bulldozing into the immovable object of Mr. Candy\u2019s just-folks awkwardness. The language is still super-salty even by today\u2019s standards, so it might not be fun for the entire family.When I\u2019m inclined to recreate my Thanksgiving movie reveries of old, well, I cannot tell a lie: I will go with my nice Blu-ray Disc of the 1933 original of \u201cKing Kong.\u201d The movie is still enough of a classic that there\u2019s nowhere you can stream it free (legally). But you can rent or buy it from Amazon, iTunes and the other usual suspects. If you\u2019re a premium member at Warner Archive, that streaming service offers the agreeable not-quite-sequel \u201cSon of Kong,\u201d featuring the great beast\u2019s far-less-terrifying-but-still-engaging offspring. \u201cKing Kong vs. Godzilla\u201d has yet to hit streaming services, but several \u201960s Japanese monster movies, from \u201cGodzilla\u201d itself to the definitively odd \u201cWar of the Gargantuas,\u201d have just landed in the aforementioned Starz app, although, again, if you\u2019re going through your cable provider, you might not be able to access them. In which case, there\u2019s always football.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Pass-Throughs vs. Corporations \u2014 Who\u2019s the Bigger Winner?", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here are some of the stories we are watching. \u2022 One of the biggest German IPOs in years could arrive next year.Pass-throughs have a lower total tax burden than corporations do. That advantage exists now and remains in both the House and Senate versions of the tax bill.The key point here is that corporations and their investors are taxed twice:First, a corporate rate on profits is paid directly by the company. Under current law, the top rate is 35 percent. Then, when the business pays returns to its investors, they pay tax on the money they\u2019ve earned when they file in April. That income \u2014 dividends and capital gains \u2014 is taxed at a top rate of 23.8 percent.Pass-through businesses, meanwhile, are taxed just once:These are small and mammoth partnerships, proprietorships and companies with fewer than 100 shareholders known as S corporations... They aren\u2019t subjected to any separate business tax, but pay on their individual income tax when the money thrown off by the business is passed through to its owners. The rate depends on what bracket someone is in, but the highest is 39.6 percent.So while the corporate rate by itself may be lower than the top pass-through rate, the total tax burden on corporations is higher.But even in Republican rewrite of the tax code \u2014 in which the corporate rate is lowered to 20 percent \u2014 pass-throughs still come out on top. That again is because corporation are taxed twice.Six months ago, Don Blankenship \u2014 the former C.E.O. of Massey Energy and once one of the most-feared men in the coal industry \u2014 shed his label as federal inmate 12393-088.Now Mr. Blankenship, who was convicted of crimes related to the explosion at the Massey-run Upper Big Branch mine in 2010 that killed 29 men, is pursuing a new career: senator.One thing Mr. Blankenship won\u2019t have a problem with is name recognition: He\u2019s one of the best-known figures in West Virginia, both for his decade-long tenure as the C.E.O. of Massey and then for his downfall after the mine explosion.Mr. Blankenship\u2019s quasi-dictatorial management style as chief executive produced spectacular results for Massey, transforming it from a relatively modest business dominated by a single family into a corporation that operated more than 150 mines and brought in more than $2.6 billion in revenue.Mr. Blankenship was eventually convicted of having deliberately skirted federal mining safety requirements. It\u2019s a charge he has consistently denied, and he has called himself an \u201cAmerican political prisoner.\u201dThere has certainly been a lot of talk about media mergers in recent weeks.But all this news may have obscured the fact that media deal making has slowed markedly this year. So far in 2017, the value of announced media deals in 2017 is down 69 percent in the United States from a year ago and 57 percent globally, according to Thomson Reuters.The total volume of these deals is at its lowest level since 2013 in the United States and 2012 worldwide.Few, for example, believe that Comcast \u2014 which is in discussions to buy significant portions of 21st Century Fox \u2014 would be allowed to complete that potential deal unless the Justice Department was defeated in its AT&T lawsuit.So until there is a conclusion to the AT&T-Time Warner deal, big media acquisitions are likely on hold.Their shared goals: Expand Kind from being a snack maker into a health-food empire, and expand its international sales.\u201cJob No. 1 is taking it global. Job No. 2 is, what other categories either are we already in, or we can easily get into, that meet the Kind promise?\u201d Grant F.

{"Headline": "Weinstein Work Pulls Lawyer Back Into an Ethical Debate", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDavid Boies may be best known for taking on nationally prominent political cases before the Supreme Court, including Bush v. Gore and the fight to legalize gay marriage.But it\u2019s his role as a hard-nosed litigator representing corporations and executives that has earned him lavish payouts but created potential ethical issues \u2014 so much so, it has forced his firm to step away from several cases.The article reported that Mr. Boies had helped execute a contract with a private investigation firm that Mr. Weinstein hired to help block a negative article about him in The New York Times. Mr. Boies\u2019s firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, has provided outside legal counsel for The Times three times in the last 10 years, including one libel case.The article said the investigative firm had been instructed to dig up information on Rose McGowan, an actress who had accused Mr. Weinstein of rape, and to find out what various reporters knew about the allegations against Mr. Weinstein.But late in the day, the paper said it was ending its relationship with his firm.\u201cWe never contemplated that the law firm would contract with an intelligence firm to conduct a secret spying operation aimed at our reporting and our reporters,\u201d The Times said in a statement. \u201cSuch an operation is reprehensible.\u201dMr. Boies said neither he nor his firm had any role in initially hiring the private investigative firm, Black Cube. But he said he had made a mistake in helping out Mr. Weinstein, whom Mr. Boies described as a longtime client and who has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex, in forging a new contract with the firm.\u201cIt was not thought through, and that was my mistake,\u201d he said in the statement. He pointed out that he had never been disciplined for his work.\u201cIn retrospect, we should not have gotten involved in the billing dispute,\u201d Mr. Boies said. \u201cIn the case of Harvey Weinstein, there is a lot of information that I didn\u2019t have.\u201dThe episode may deepen the perception that Mr. Boies pushes the boundaries on potential conflicts, while raising questions about why he didn\u2019t seek to learn more about Mr. Weinstein\u2019s team of hired-gun investigators.\u201cFrom Boies\u2019s perspective, this is no good deed goes unpunished,\u201d said Laurie L. Levenson, the David W. Burcham chair in ethical advocacy at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. \u201cFrom what I heard, he should have had more information as to what it was about. He is leaving a thumbprint on it, and whether he wants it or not, this now belongs to him.\u201dStephen Gillers, who teaches legal ethics at New York University School of Law, said there were several ways to view Mr. Boies\u2019s decision to execute the contract.\u201cIf all he did, as he seems to claim, was help Weinstein unearth facts about his accusers that affected their credibility and might have persuaded the paper not to run the story, that would not be seen as adversely affecting his \u2018loyalty\u2019 to The Times,\u201d Mr. Gillers said. \u201cThe paper has an interest in the credibility of its sources.\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, if Boies assisted Weinstein in targeting the integrity of Times journalists as a way to prevent the story from running or, failing that, to discredit the reporting if it did run, that would certainly be disloyal to his client,\u201d he said.Lawyers usually deal with potential conflicts by giving clients the option of switching to another law firm, legal experts said. In many instances, if the matters are not related, the clients will give the lawyer permission to keep representing them.Sometimes broad waivers are included in the initial retention agreement. The agreement between Mr. Boies\u2019s firm and The Times acknowledged that the firm would from time to time do work for clients whose interest may be adverse to the newspaper\u2019s \u2014 a fact that Mr. Boies cited Tuesday.But The Times\u2019s statement on Tuesday made clear that it believed Mr. Boies\u2019s firm had gone too far by handling a contract for a company that sought to undermine a major reporting effort.Actual conflict or not, legal experts said Mr. Boies would most likely pay little penalty for his dual work for Mr. Weinstein and The Times. They said disciplinary action was unlikely because it usually required a formal complaint. Moreover, they said, some clients may find Mr. Boies\u2019s aggressiveness appealing.\u201cI don\u2019t think this will hurt from a business perspective,\u201d said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School and a former prosecutor who specializes in legal ethics. \u201cIt is not going to harm his reputation with most clients. When you hire Boies, you are hiring an aggressive lawyer.\u201dThat assertive, sometimes belligerent, style has made Mr. Boies a favorite in the business world. Steven A. Cohen, the billionaire investor, hired him to do battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission when it was deciding how long to bar him from the securities industry for failing to adequately monitor employees charged with insider trading. Maurice R. Greenberg, the former head of American International Group, tapped Mr. Boies and his team to deal with a long-running civil fraud case filed against him.So Mr. Boies started his own firm, which grew quickly. Some critics said his affinity for high-profile cases led him to take on more work than he could handle.Occasionally, he worked for little or no money. He charged a reduced fee, for instance, to represent the federal government in its failed attempt to break up Microsoft on antitrust grounds. His videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, one of the company\u2019s founders, is remembered as a classic example of the art of cross-examination.And a casual follower of his career might take Mr. Boies for a champion of progressive causes. He represented Al Gore in the 2000 recount litigation that culminated in the Supreme Court decision that handed the presidency to George W. Bush.And he may be best known to the general public for joining with Theodore B. Olson, his adversary in Bush v. Gore, to challenge California\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage.The Supreme Court heard the case in 2013 but ducked it. The court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage two years later.While all that was going on, Mr. Boies\u2019s moneymaking side of the business was generating some unflattering headlines.In 2016, the law firm stopped representing Theranos after the disagreements over legal strategy with the board. There were also allegations that lawyers at Boies Schiller were trying to learn the identity of sources The Wall Street Journal used for a series of stories on the company.Mr. Boies said Tuesday that the incidents at Theranos and Adelphia had been misconstrued by his critics. He said that his firm had not been disciplined with regard to Theranos, and that there had been no attempt to impede the Wall Street Journal reporting.He conceded that aggressive litigation was going to leave some people unhappy.Megan Twohey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trans-Pacific Trade Partners Are Moving On, Without the U.S.", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 President Trump shook up the world economic order this year by pulling the United States out of a major international trade pact and raising fundamental questions about its global role.Today, the world is moving on without it.A group of 11 countries announced on Saturday that they had committed to resurrecting a sweeping multinational trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, without the United States. A new deal, which would have to be signed and ratified by each country, would include major United States allies like Japan, Canada and Mexico. Collectively, they account for about a sixth of global trade.The agreement will \u201cserve as a foundation for building a broader free-trade area\u201d across Asia, Taro Kono, Japan\u2019s foreign minister, said in a statement.Some details of a new deal, including when rules would be phased in, still need to be determined, and prospective member states like Canada raised last-minute concerns. But a new deal could be announced as soon as early next year.Other countries are slowly but surely making progress on their own sweeping trade deals, without any participation from the United States. China is negotiating a potential deal with 16 Asia-Pacific countries, including Japan, India and South Korea. The European Union and Japan hope to strike separate trade pacts with a group of South American countries, Brazil and Argentina among them.From tough talk on China (\u201cthey took our jobs\u201d) to casting doubt on the decades-old North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cthe worst trade deal ever made\u201d), Mr. Trump has threatened to lob a grenade at an increasingly integrated global economic system.His administration has questioned years of efforts to lower global trade barriers, arguing that they hurt American workers and led to big trade deficits. It also means dealing with nations one-on-one, rejecting the regional and global pacts his predecessors pursued.\u201cAt some point, the administration may begin to see that this was a strategic mistake and that dropping out of trade is not in the interest of American workers,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a lobbying group that represents companies like Walmart, Ford and Microsoft.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to compete and be a winner in global markets \u2014 and the danger is, the strategy is divisive,\u201d he added.More worrying for some is the possibility that the Trump administration is ceding its position as global leader to China, a rising economic and political influence in the region.\u201cThe U.S. has lost its leadership role,\u201d said Jayant Menon, an economist at the Asian Development Bank. \u201cAnd China is quickly replacing it.\u201dUnder the new Trans-Pacific trade deal, members would enjoy tariff-free trade with one another. That would allow companies in the member countries to have faster and better access to other markets than their American rivals.But there are still challenges ahead of the group, and not all the prospective member states meeting in Danang, Vietnam, were in complete accord over the finer details of a new deal.\u201cWe are pleased that progress is being made towards a possible agreement, but there is still some work to be done,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, Canada\u2019s minister of international trade, said in a statement. He added that Canada would sign a deal only once its interests had been addressed.The 11 countries working toward the new agreement are Japan, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Chile, Peru, New Zealand and Brunei.Mr. Trump has expressed support for the nation\u2019s regional allies even as he rejects or criticizes trade deals with them. He reiterated American support for cooperation on security during his stops in Japan and South Korea.\u201cI don\u2019t blame China,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a tweet on Friday morning shortly before leaving for Vietnam.\u201cThe U.S. has been the driving force, not just behind the global economic order, but also pursuing higher standards on free trade and securing provisions that go way above the World Trade Organization obligations,\u201d said Stephen Olson, a former United States trade negotiator who worked on Nafta. \u201cIf the U.S. abdicates that role, it puts us in uncharted territory,\u201d he added.In the absence of American leadership, Japan has driven the new round of talks. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has spoken of the countries working on an agreement as Ocean\u2019s Eleven, after the movie.Japan\u2019s long-term hope is that the United States will eventually return to the fold.\u201cWe will just go ahead and make it and we will welcome the United States back if they decide to do so,\u201d said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to Washington. Completing a deal now, he said, \u201cmakes the possibility of the U.S. coming back more likely.\u201dThe new agreement has been crafted with the hope that the United States will one day participate. Some of the provisions \u2014 among them ones that the United States lobbied for \u2014 could ultimately be suspended, including some on copyright protection.Given the intensity with which Mr. Trump excoriated the original deal, it seems unlikely that this administration will come back to the table.\u201cIt will be difficult for the administration to backtrack,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, a former United States trade negotiator who worked on the Trans-Pacific deal and is now managing director of the Washington office of the Asia Society Policy Institute.But other countries like Korea, the Philippines and Thailand are expected to join once the deal is ratified, said Ms. Cutler.For members, the pact could offer a sense of security in a time when a number of politicians around the world are questioning the impact of trade and globalization.Speaking last week, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said the deal promised \u201cgreater transparency and a stronger rule of law, in a world which is dangerously short of both,\u201d referring to the \u201csiren songs of populists, advocating protectionism.\u201d\u201cThe T.P.P. creates rules of the road to match the new economic world we are living in,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said.Notably, the Trans-Pacific pact includes Mexico and Canada, which are at loggerheads with the Trump administration over Nafta. Mr. Trump has raised the prospect of the demise of that agreement, citing the movement of industrial jobs from the United States to those countries.\u201cThere is a genuine risk that the U.S. is going to further disengage from regional economic interaction,\u201d said Christopher Nelson, editor of the Nelson Report, a foreign policy and trade newsletter. \u201cAnd from the corporate standpoint, American companies are disadvantaged competitively if we\u2019re not out there with both feet playing the game.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong, and Motoko Rich reported from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tax Bills Would Reward Companies That Moved Money Offshore", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past few decades, some of the largest companies in the United States made a big bet: By stashing hundreds of billions of dollars of profits offshore, they could slash their taxes and bolster their profits.It would take a generation to see if the strategy would fully pay off, because the law allowed companies only to defer the taxes on overseas earnings, not to permanently avoid them. Would they ever be able to bring the profits back to the United States without incurring huge tax bills?Some 20 years after the tax-avoiding technique became widespread, it is poised to pay off in a big way. The Republican tax bills making their way through the House and Senate would allow companies to bring nearly $3 trillion in profits home, at greatly reduced tax rates.In a tax-overhaul package that would provide the greatest benefits to wealthy individuals and corporations, the so-called repatriation provision stands out. It would give companies a permanent tax break of about half a trillion dollars, rewarding the likes of Google, Apple, Pfizer and General Electric. Corporate America claims that about $3 trillion in profits were generated in places like Bermuda, Grand Cayman and Luxembourg.The tax breaks for bringing home such offshore profits \u201cconfirm the central tenet of tax planning that a tax deferred is a tax avoided,\u201d said David Miller, a tax lawyer at Proskauer Rose. \u201cFor decades, U.S. multinationals have shifted profits abroad and deferred their taxes on them. If either of the tax bills pass, they will be rewarded for doing so.\u201dTo be sure, the legislation erects some potential guardrails against future efforts to shift profits offshore. It would establish a minimum tax abroad on certain types of income \u2014 at least 10 percent for the first several years in the Senate version \u2014 thus raising the tax bills for many companies on their foreign profits. And regulators in Europe and elsewhere abroad have accelerated their efforts to crack down on such profit shifting out of their countries.President Trump and congressional Republicans argue that it\u2019s important to get companies to bring the money home because it would be used to create jobs \u2014 although that didn\u2019t happen the last time lawmakers enacted a similar tax break. Mr. Trump predicted on Tuesday that trillions of dollars would be repatriated \u2014 money, he said, that companies currently are \u201cjust not able to bring back.\u201dUnder current law, American companies pay taxes on their worldwide profits at a rate of 35 percent, the highest statutory rate in the world. But the law has a big caveat: Companies can indefinitely defer the taxes on profits earned abroad \u2014 as long as those profits stay overseas.That gives companies a powerful incentive to push as much profit as possible into subsidiaries abroad. Microsoft, Merck, Facebook and other companies attribute large chunks of their profits to entities in low- or zero-tax offshore jurisdictions and therefore enjoy effective tax rates that are nowhere near 35 percent.But companies can defer the American taxes only as long as their profits remain offshore. If they want to repatriate the cash back to the United States, they must pay taxes at the rate of 35 percent, minus whatever they already paid abroad.A large loophole was opened in 1996 when the Clinton administration\u2019s Treasury Department introduced a rule that allowed different subsidiaries of the same company to move money back and forth without incurring American taxes.That removed one of the main deterrents to companies pushing profits into overseas tax havens \u2014 and opened the floodgates. Since then, the share of American companies\u2019 foreign profits attributed to a handful of tax havens has more than doubled. Now, nearly two-thirds of all profits that American companies claim to earn overseas are generated in tax-friendly jurisdictions including Bermuda, Ireland and the Netherlands, according to data compiled by Gabriel Zucman, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.The problem for corporate America, though, is that it can\u2019t easily use that overseas money for things like paying dividends or buying their own shares, techniques that publicly traded companies use to please their investors. Doing so would trigger hefty tax bills.After intense lobbying by big companies, Congress in 2004 passed the American Jobs Creation Act, which provided a one-time tax break for companies that wanted to repatriate their offshore profits. Companies brought home $312 billion at a rate of just 5.25 percent. Although the break was intended to spur investment and hiring, a plethora of studies showed that companies responded by spending billions buying back their shares, lifting their stock prices, and didn\u2019t expand their American work forces.Pfizer, for example, brought home $37 billion at the reduced rates \u2014 and shed 10,000 workers. Hewlett-Packard repatriated more than $14 billion, while eliminating more than 14,000 jobs.After that tax break, companies resumed pushing profits offshore \u2014 at an even brisker pace. Early in the Obama administration, Cisco Systems led a lobbying effort for yet another tax holiday, which went nowhere.Now, companies have accumulated approximately $2.8 trillion in profits offshore, beyond the reach of American tax authorities and barely touched by other countries, according to the Zion Research Group, a research boutique focused on accounting and tax issues.The proposals in the Republican tax package are different from the 2004 holiday. Under the current versions, all foreign earnings sitting offshore would be considered to be automatically repatriated, and taxes at a reduced rate would be paid over several years. The rates would vary, with earnings held in cash taxed at 10 percent in the Senate version. Other earnings would be taxed at half that rate. Companies would receive credit for some foreign taxes already paid.Zion Research estimated that under the Senate proposal, companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 would pay about $570 billion less than what they would if they brought the profits home under current law.American companies would no longer owe full taxes on overseas profits. Instead, they would pay taxes at a minimum rate of at least 10 percent on some types of foreign profits \u2014 compared with a new, lower rate on domestic earnings of 20 percent.Kristin J. Forbes, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s management school who served in the George W. Bush administration, said the repeated changes to the tax treatment of overseas earning were problematic.\u201cThey do cause companies to change behavior and then game the system the way they have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBig picture: This isn\u2019t how you\u2019d like to do tax policy.\u201dJim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Building A.I. That Can Build A.I.", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "Google and others, fighting for a small pool of researchers, are looking for automated ways to deal with a shortage of artificial intelligence experts.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 They are a dream of researchers but perhaps a nightmare for highly skilled computer programmers: artificially intelligent machines that can build other artificially intelligent machines.With it, Google may soon find a way to create A.I. technology that can partly take the humans out of building the A.I. systems that many believe are the future of the technology industry.The project is part of a much larger effort to bring the latest and greatest A.I. techniques to a wider collection of companies and software developers.The world\u2019s largest tech businesses, including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, sometimes pay millions of dollars a year to A.I. experts, effectively cornering the market for this hard-to-find talent. The shortage isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, just because mastering these skills takes years of work.This is not altruism. Researchers like Mr. Dean believe that if more people and companies are working on artificial intelligence, it will propel their own research. At the same time, companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft see serious money in the trend that Mr. Sirosh described. All of them are selling cloud-computing services that can help other businesses and developers build A.I.\u201cThere is real demand for this,\u201d said Matt Scott, a co-founder and the chief technical officer of Malong, a start-up in China that offers similar services. \u201cAnd the tools are not yet satisfying all the demand.\u201dEventually, the Google project will help companies build systems with artificial intelligence even if they don\u2019t have extensive expertise, Mr. Dean said. Today, he estimated, no more than a few thousand companies have the right talent for building A.I., but many more have the necessary data.\u201cWe want to go from thousands of organizations solving machine learning problems to millions,\u201d he said.Google is investing heavily in cloud-computing services \u2014 services that help other businesses build and run software \u2014 which it expects to be one of its primary economic engines in the years to come. And after snapping up such a large portion of the world\u2019s top A.I researchers, it has a means of jump-starting this engine.By analyzing the sounds in a vast collection of old technical support calls, for instance, a machine-learning algorithm can learn to recognize spoken words.But building a neural network is not like building a website or some run-of-the-mill smartphone app. It requires significant math skills, extreme trial and error, and a fair amount of intuition. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagn\u00e9, the chief executive of an independent machine-learning lab called Element AI, refers to the process as \u201ca new kind of computer programming.\u201dIn building a neural network, researchers run dozens or even hundreds of experiments across a vast network of machines, testing how well an algorithm can learn a task like recognizing an image or translating from one language to another. Then they adjust particular parts of the algorithm over and over again, until they settle on something that works. Some call it a \u201cdark art,\u201d just because researchers find it difficult to explain why they make particular adjustments.But with AutoML, Google is trying to automate this process. It is building algorithms that analyze the development of other algorithms, learning which methods are successful and which are not. Eventually, they learn to build more effective machine learning. Google said AutoML could now build algorithms that, in some cases, identified objects in photos more accurately than services built solely by human experts.Barret Zoph, one of the Google researchers behind the project, believes that the same method will eventually work well for other tasks, like speech recognition or machine translation.Many believe such methods will significantly accelerate the progress of A.I. in both the online and physical worlds. At the University of California, Berkeley, researchers are building techniques that could allow robots to learn new tasks based on what they have learned in the past.\u201cComputers are going to invent the algorithms for us, essentially,\u201d said a Berkeley professor, Pieter Abbeel. \u201cAlgorithms invented by computers can solve many, many problems very quickly \u2014 at least that is the hope.\u201dThis is also a way of expanding the number of people and businesses that can build artificial intelligence. These methods will not replace A.I. researchers entirely. Experts, like those at Google, must still do much of the important design work. But the belief is that the work of a few experts can help many others build their own software.Renato Negrinho, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who is exploring technology similar to AutoML, said this was not a reality today but should be in the years to come. \u201cIt is just a matter of when,\u201d he said.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a researcher for Google. He is Sergey Levine, not Levin. The caption also included an outdated credential for him. He is an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, not a post-doctoral researcher there.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Two Contrasting Views of Silicon Valley\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryThe pervasive influence of Silicon Valley on our economy, culture and politics is a subject worthy of close study. Two important new books released this week offer startlingly different approaches and conclusions on these complex issues. The contrasting epigraphs that begin the works perfectly reflect their respective perspectives.To be fair, the conflict in visions is less stark than it seems because the two authors are focused on different time periods. \u201cTroublemakers\u201d covers \u201cthe generational handoff\u201d that happened between the late 1960s and the early \u201980s \u201cas pioneers of the semiconductor industry passed the baton to younger up-and-comers.\u201d Mr. Cohen\u2019s ire primarily targets those \u201cwho helped nurture the World Wide Web to prosperity in the 1990s before turning to investing.\u201dOne does not have to be sympathetic to a more benign view of the technology industry to appreciate Ms. Berlin\u2019s deeply researched and dramatic narrative of Silicon Valley\u2019s early years in \u201cTroublemakers.\u201d To tell this story, she selects seven lesser-known but influential figures to follow closely throughout that period. These include the first woman to take a technology company public, the first chairman of Apple, and a man who played critical roles in government to create the internet and in industry to commercialize it through the personal computer. Their names will most likely be unfamiliar, but their meticulously told stories permit the reader to gain a nuanced understanding of the emergence of the broader technology ecosystem that has enabled Silicon Valley to thrive.Nuance is not a word that comes to mind in reading Mr. Cohen\u2019s attack on Silicon Valley\u2019s powers that be. The first two chapters are devoted to key figures in the history of Stanford\u2019s administration and computer science department, emphasizing both the university\u2019s willingness to trade off academic rigor for financial gain and its institutional sympathy for eugenics in the early 1900s and, more recently, extreme libertarianism. These underlying themes, in Mr. Cohen\u2019s view, underpin \u201cthe Stanford model of integrating the hacker and the entrepreneur.\u201d This model is reflected in staking William Hewlett and David Packard in the 1930s, establishing the Stanford Industrial Park in the 1950s and obtaining a $336 million payout from Google stock in return for granting the exclusive PageRank license.It is this unholy alliance between hacker and entrepreneur values that Mr. Cohen rails against for the balance of the book. Although he pauses for a handful of pages to speak about Microsoft \u2014 \u201cIf the Know-It-Alls\u2019 values represent a merger of a hacker\u2019s radical individualism and an entrepreneur\u2019s greed, then only one man can be considered their forefather: Bill Gates\u201d \u2014 he believes that the negative ramifications \u201conly fully flourished with the widespread adoption of the World Wide Web starting in the late 1990s.\u201d And so beginning with Marc Andreessen, who developed the first commercialized web browser, Netscape Navigator, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d proceeds to attack the character of just about every boldfaced name among tech billionaires. All are found guilty of either always promoting the insidious tech dogma that places no constraints on their ability to disrupt the status quo for their own financial gain or \u2014 as in the case of the once idealistic founders of Google and Facebook \u2014 having along the way been \u201cseduced by the power and money offered by venture capitalists.\u201dThe history that underpins that overarching thesis feels both selective and less than rigorous. Niels Reimers, the founder of Stanford\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing and one of the seven key industry figures profiled in detail in \u201cTroublemakers,\u201d is not even mentioned in \u201cThe-Know-It-Alls.\u201d Given the complex negotiations required to secure university approval, this seems like a significant oversight for a book whose thesis hinges in part on Stanford\u2019s supposed unthinking commercialism. And statements like computer science was \u201cstill something of an obscure discipline in the late 1980s\u201d just don\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. By 1990, there were almost 800 computer science degree programs offered at colleges and universities, enrolling tens of thousands of students.Although Mr. Cohen has identified legitimately disturbing aspects of the tech culture, he becomes repetitive, and his tone is unnecessarily conspiratorial. He also ignores when the facts contradict his assertions. Mr. Cohen complains about the \u201cPayPal mafia,\u201d former employees who \u201cprovided each other with cash, counsel and contacts.\u201d Mr. Cohen finds \u201csomething jarring about a group of self-styled survival of the fittest free marketeers committing to a strategy of collective risk and mutual support.\u201dWhen the Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is profiled as a contrast to the libertarian fanaticism and raw commercialism of the Know-It-Alls, his inability to raise funding is used to reinforce this point: \u201cWales and his partners had no rich friends to lean on in tough times.\u201d The narrative makes clear, however, that his problem was a flawed business model, not his lack of access to the PayPal mafia or other venture investors. Similarly, Mr. Cohen does not directly confront the irony that the story of Wikipedia\u2019s ultimate success was made possible only by its free-riding on Google\u2019s powerful \u2014 but in his view morally suspect \u2014 search engine.The tech industry has earned a takedown book that documents its self-interested justifications for any number of policies that are clearly not in the public interest. Its track record on matters including cybersecurity, gender equality and privacy is shameful. The brief profiles of \u201cThe Know-It Alls,\u201d sprinkled with gratuitous ad hominem observations (for example, Mr. Cohen writes that PayPal is responsible for \u201creleasing into the wild a self-satisfied Peter Thiel, a one-man wrecking crew who has been sowing chaos through American society up to this very day\u201d), do not get the job done.Given the profound impact on our lives of the technology industry and the apparent flaws in its current culture, both books leave the reader wondering where to go from here. \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d suggests that \u201cEurope provides a model\u201d relying on extensive regulation but, given the absence of any European tech giants of note, this seems like throwing the baby out with the bath water. Although the compelling history in \u201cTroublemakers\u201d provides a number of tantalizing clues as to where things got off track, this is not the focus of the book. Ms. Berlin does not whitewash the aspects of even the valley\u2019s early years that foreshadow the more profound cultural issues to emerge in the industry\u2019s middle age, writing, \u201cIt takes a certain kind of audacity to think you can launch a company, much less invent an industry \u2014 and audacity often veers into arrogance.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t go out of her way to explore their implications, either.When the founding of Fairchild Semiconductor is discussed, William Shockley is mentioned in passing, but Ms. Berlin notes that he \u201chad not yet fully descended into the paranoia and eugenic fervor that would later mar his reputation.\u201d In fact, his paranoia and abusiveness at least were already well known and, given that these qualities have been recurring contemporary industry themes, would have been worth examining.Similarly, when it\u2019s noted that a key to the venture capitalist Don Valentine\u2019s success was his willingness to overlook \u201cdeviant\u201d behavior, some discussion of the downside of letting the hacker culture run wild might have made sense.Silicon Valley\u2019s history is still being written. Both of these books are important reminders that whether or not it is ultimately a story with a happy ending will be a function of our collective willingness to closely examine the sector\u2019s origins to better understand not only the sources of innovation but how the most destructive aspects of the culture were allowed to fester for so long.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Get High Marks for Covering Infertility Treatments", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserA relatively small number of companies offer generous benefits for infertility treatment to employees, while most have minimal or no coverage, a new report found.It\u2019s a case of \u201chaves and have-nots,\u201d said Jake Anderson, a founder of FertilityIQ, the start-up that wrote the report.It found that technology companies as well as employers in consulting and banking tended to offer generous coverage for costly assisted-reproduction techniques like in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F.FertilityIQ was founded by Mr. Anderson and Deborah Bialis, a married couple who saw a need for more detailed information after undergoing treatment for infertility themselves. FertilityIQ gathers information from more than 10,000 verified I.V.F. patients who contribute to its database. Employers examined in the report included companies where FertilityIQ\u2019s participants work, as well as additional employers identified by fertility clinics or researched by Fertility IQ itself, Mr. Anderson said.FertilityIQ\u2019s goal is to provide as much detail as possible, he said, to help people navigate their way through a stressful process. Mr. Anderson\u2019s advice to those seeking infertility treatment was simply, \u201cBuckle in, financially and emotionally.\u201dEmployer benefits are important, the couple said, because I.V.F. is costly and demand for it is increasing.Treatment isn\u2019t cheap. The cost of a single cycle of I.V.F. is often about $12,000, but that number is just a start. Drugs and related procedures, like genetic screening, push the average price in most major metropolitan areas to well above $20,000 per cycle, FertilityIQ found. And most couples undergo at least two cycles on average, Mr. Anderson said.The report ranks individual employers and broad sectors, based on criteria that include the value of the benefits and the ease with which employees can use them. Some companies rank higher because they avoid preauthorization rules, like trying unsuccessfully to conceive for a period of time or receiving a specific infertility diagnosis, that can be particularly restrictive for same-sex couples or single women, Mr. Anderson said.The technology industry, in particular, shines at making infertility benefits widely accessible, the report found, and some employers are in a sort of benefits arms race, offering more generous coverage to remain competitive in recruiting and retaining workers. Facebook ranks high on the list of tech companies, as it did in FertilityIQ\u2019s report last year. The company covers up to four I.V.F. cycles, including genetic testing, with no preapproval required. (FertilityIQ values the cycles at $25,000 each, for a total benefit value of $100,000.)Other tech companies are beefing up coverage, according to the new analysis.Microsoft is expanding its benefit in January, replacing a fixed amount of $15,000 with a more flexible offering. \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re providing industry-leading benefits,\u201d said Sonja Kellen, director of global health and wellness benefits at Microsoft.Microsoft will work with Progyny, a fertility benefits manager, to offer up to three treatment cycles. The benefit includes genetic testing as well as the freezing of eggs or embryos and storage for up to four years. The new policy makes treatment available to employees without demonstrated infertility issues, so gay couples pursuing parenthood through surrogacy or a single woman who wants to freeze eggs for use in the future can use the benefit.The new approach aims to make benefits more broadly available and helps reduce pressure on employees undergoing I.V.F. to maximize their benefit, Ms. Kellen said.For instance, a couple undergoing I.V.F. with a dollar cap on their employer benefit may decide to have multiple embryos transferred at one time, perhaps resulting in twins or triplets. Those pregnancies are more likely to have complications.Medications for the treatment are covered separately, through the company\u2019s prescription drug benefit, she said.Pinterest, the online social network, covered up to $20,000 for treatment costs this year, but will change its benefit in January to cover up to four rounds of I.V.F., said a company spokeswoman, Malorie Lucich. The expansion, she said, was based on feedback the company received from its 1,200 employees.\u201cIt\u2019s a very family friendly culture here,\u201d she said.Among other big tech companies, Google covers three cycles including genetic testing, a benefit that FertilityIQ values at $75,000, and Apple offers a $20,000 benefit. Neither company requires preapproval. Amazon\u2019s benefit of $15,000 with a required preauthorization placed it relatively low on FertilityIQ\u2019s list of tech companies.Some companies in consulting, like Bain, and finance, like Bank of America, offer unlimited I.V.F. benefits as long as employees meet preauthorization rules, the report found.Other financial companies offer more limited coverage, yet are moving to expand it. American Express, for instance, increased its cap for treatment this year to $35,000, up from $20,000, for full-time and part-time employees.Retail companies generally rank low on FertilityIQ\u2019s list, Mr. Anderson said, but Starbucks is notable for making a $15,000 I.V.F. benefit available, including to part-time store workers.Here are some questions and answers about infertility coverage:What should I do if my employer doesn\u2019t offer I.V.F. benefits?Employees can lobby their human resources departments to offer coverage, particularly if their employers are \u201cself insured\u201d \u2014 meaning the companies pay claims themselves, rather than paying a premium to an insurer, said Barbara Collura, president and chief executive of Resolve, an infertility support and advocacy group.Self-insured employers \u2014 typically companies with more than 250 workers \u2014 have more leeway to expand coverage, Ms. Collura said. Employers that don\u2019t self-insure have less flexibility because the benefits are determined by the insurer, she said.Eights states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island) require employers to offer some level of I.V.F. benefit, Ms. Collura said. But coverage isn\u2019t necessarily generous, and self-insured employers and small employers are typically exempt from the laws.Is financial help available for the cost of infertility treatment?What proportion of employers over all offer I.V.F. benefits?About a quarter of employers with 500 or more workers cover the procedure, while 37 percent of employers with 20,000 or more workers cover it, according to a 2017 report from the benefits consultant Mercer \u2014 about the same level found the previous year.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

A third, larger spacecraft in 2020 is to gather samples and then bring them back to Earth, the first haul of moon rocks since a Soviet robotic probe\u2019s return in 1976.But these plans almost came to a halt a couple of years ago \u2014 not because of technological challenges or financial shortfalls, but because of an international agreement known as the Outer Space Treaty, which is marking its 50th anniversary this year.The treaty spells out what countries are and are not allowed to do in space. Its crowning achievement was stopping the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union from expanding into space.But the agreement may now be getting in the way of entrepreneurs with plans to push farther and faster into space than national agencies like NASA.\u201cBefore it was something really, really hypothetical,\u201d said Fabio Tronchetti, a law professor at Harbin Institute of Technology in China. \u201cBut now there are groups that are really serious.

Richards, Moon Express\u2019s chief executive \u2014 whose business plan is \u201cto expand Earth\u2019s economic sphere to the moon and beyond\u201d \u2014 is far from the only entrepreneur looking for business opportunities beyond our planet.As these companies go where no businesses have gone before, they raise questions only fuzzily addressed by the Outer Space Treaty: What are private companies allowed to do in space? Can a company mine the moon or an asteroid and then sell what it has pulled out? How are countries to regulate these businesses?Internationally, countries have been discussing how to answer these questions. In the United States, Congress has begun tackling regulatory issues. Some warn that if the United States does not set up business-friendly policies, then the start-ups could move elsewhere \u2014 including such seemingly unlikely places as Luxembourg.The treaty also prohibited nations from making any claim of sovereignty over any part of the rest of the solar system.Moon Express ran into a bureaucratic wall because the treaty declares that activities of nongovernmental entities \u2014 a classification that includes commercial companies \u2014 \u201crequire authorization and continuing supervision\u201d of the government. (The United States had insisted on the clause, rejecting the Soviet view that space exploration should be limited to governments.)The Federal Aviation Administration licenses rocket launches and re-entry of commercial spacecraft from orbit in order to ensure the safety of people on the ground. The Federal Communications Commission regulates communications satellites, and the Department of Commerce regulates commercial remote sensing satellites.But the United States does not as yet have a process for authorizing or supervising novel endeavors like a private company landing on the moon.In announcing the decision, however, the F.A.A. said the approval applied only to this one Moon Express launch, and that not even Moon Express could count on a favorable outcome in the future.Moon Express has begun discussions with the F.A.A. for the second trip to the lunar south pole, and Dr. Richards is confident that the company could successfully pull off its first three flights via the current regulatory patchwork.But if Congress and the president do not come up with a better solution, Moon Express, SpaceX, Blue Origin and the rest of the emerging industry could run into more bureaucratic walls, and companies might start looking for other places to set up shop.Dr. Richards said he remained optimistic.\u201cEach company is moving forward with some assumption of risk but a presumption of the U.S. government coming through with frameworks that allow that to happen,\u201d Dr. Richards said in October during a visit at his company\u2019s Florida headquarters.Planetary Resources\u2019s goal is to mine the solar system\u2019s asteroids. Luxembourg, a nation smaller than Rhode Island with a long history in mining, has bet 200 million euros \u2014 more than $225 million \u2014 on this industry that does not exist.

In return, Luxembourg owns a 10 percent share of the company, said Etienne Schneider, the country\u2019s deputy prime minister.Back in April, Luxembourg\u2019s crown prince, his wife and government officials paid a visit to Planetary Resources, putting on white gowns, gloves, wispy caps and baby blue bootees \u2014 a distinctly unroyal outfit sometimes called a \u201cbunny suit\u201d \u2014 to take a close look at where the company is assembling small satellites.In June, Mr. Schneider returned to the United States to host a symposium with a roomful of bankers and venture capitalists, a vivid demonstration that private space investment has reached a tipping point of credibility.A Goldman Sachs report about innovative space businesses that came out in the spring seemed to agree. \u201cSpace mining could be more realistic than perceived,\u201d the report said. \u201cWhile the psychological barrier to mining asteroids is high, the actual financial and technological barriers are far lower.\u201dAt the Manhattan presentation, Mr. Schneider readily acknowledged that the notion of asteroid mining sounds like science fiction and that he often gets quizzical questions about why Luxembourg is spending money chasing this.Mr. Schneider recalled that during a visit to Silicon Valley in 2012, he met S. Pete Worden, then the director of the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., who suggested that Luxembourg look into asteroid mining.\u201cAt the time, I listened to him and wondered what this guy might have smoked,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.But more discussions and research convinced Mr. Schneider this was a promising possibility.For Planetary Resources, the first wave of development is to culminate in a doughnut-shape spacecraft heading on a prospecting mission to a near-Earth asteroid in 2020.Sometime after that, the company hopes to mine in earnest \u2014 for seemingly mundane water ice. But water, in addition to potentially providing something to drink for astronauts, can be split into hydrogen and oxygen. Both can be used as rocket propellent; the oxygen, of course, also can provide air to breathe.As a business, Planetary Resources is betting that by the time it extracts water from an asteroid, there will be a customer like NASA interested in buying water, hydrogen and oxygen.Eventually, the company aims to extract platinum, currently worth more than $900 an ounce, and other precious metals.To make these pursuits easier, Luxembourg passed a space law that took effect this summer. Planetary Resources has set up its European office there. Moves like this one are in part motivating policymakers in the United States to devote more attention to American laws that currently govern commercial space activities.Ambiguities in the Outer Space Treaty currently create uncertainty over whether anyone can profit from such business ventures. Article II in particular states, \u201cOuter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.\u201dThis year, Congress is revisiting the Outer Space Treaty again, hoping to boost nascent space companies looking to push outward into the solar system.It would put the regulatory power in an Office of Space Commerce, which would have 60 days to decide whether to approve or deny a company\u2019s application. The full House has not yet taken up the bill, and the Senate is still working on its version.Officials at Moon Express and Planetary Resources say they do not want unfettered freedom in space, nor do they seek withdrawal from the Outer Space Treaty.\u201cOur goal is to have a space environment that is populated by people acting responsibly,\u201d said Peter Marquez, vice president for global engagement at Planetary Resources. \u201cIf there aren\u2019t any adults in the room, it concerns me. If it turns into the wild, wild West of just do whatever you want, then that kind of runs against concepts and precepts of Outer Space Treaty.\u201dThese companies do want the regulations to be \u201clight-touch\u201d and hope that the default inclination of the U.S. government will be to say yes.Once the price of transportation comes down, more business opportunities will open up, Dr. Richards said.The moon, peppered with the impacts of asteroids over the eons, should also possess dollops of platinum and other precious metals. Helium-3, embedded in the lunar crust by the solar wind, could be fuel for future fusion power plants.Moon Express\u2019s family of spacecraft could be a boon to scientists, sending low-cost probes not just to the moon but to other planets.Patches of eternal sunshine on the moon could be limited, valuable resources that nations and companies will someday squabble over.Dr. Richards compared this moment he sees coming to the 19th century California Gold Rush, when gold diggers jousted over the most lucrative places to sift ore. But he was confident that the new competitors would reach compromises.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be bad players per se, but there could be arguments over areas of operation overlap,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those are problems for the future, and that\u2019ll be a great problem to have.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the last time a spacecraft brought moon rocks back to Earth. It was a Soviet probe in 1976, not the last of NASA\u2019s Apollo missions. Additionally a picture used in an earlier version of this article misidentified the location of a visit by the Hereditary Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg. It was from their visit of SSL in California, not an earlier stop at Planetary Resources in Washington State.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Citigroup, Twitter, Lyft: Prince\u2019s Arrest Touches Many", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmong Prince Alwaleed\u2019s crown jewels: sizable stakes in Twitter, Lyft and Citigroup. He has gone into business with some of the corporate world\u2019s biggest titans, including Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and Michael R. Bloomberg.His investments span the globe, including the Four Seasons Hotel George V in Paris, the Savoy in London and the Plaza in New York. He has also invested in the AccorHotels chain and Canary Wharf, the London business development.So vast are his investments that he has been referred to as the Warren Buffett of the Middle East.Prince Alwaleed\u2019s arrest is likely to reverberate across dozens of companies around the world that count the investment company that he founded, Kingdom Holding, as a major investor or shareholder.The arrests appeared to be the crown prince\u2019s latest step to make good on his ambitious modernization plans and to further consolidate the remarkable degree of power he has amassed at age 32 over military, foreign, economic and social policies. His ascent and brash approach have angered some members of the royal family.Prince Alwaleed, a 62-year-old with an Omar Sharif mustache, ubiquitous sunshades and penchant for publicity, is a relatively flamboyant figure for the royal family and is one of the most prominent Saudis internationally. His arrest seems aimed at demonstrating that no one is beyond the reach of the committee and the crown prince.The confinement of the princes, said to be in the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh, could be a particularly strange experience for Prince Alwaleed, who owns stakes in a number of Four Seasons hotels.Set to action-movie music, much of the video unfolds against the backdrop of his 280-foot yacht, the Kingdom 5KR.During the trip, the prince, who already owns several dozen hotels in Egypt, announced a further $800 million investment in the country\u2019s tourism industry. He drew criticism from some conservative Egyptians for a video that showed him meeting with Egypt\u2019s female minister of investment and international cooperation, Sahar Nasr, aboard his yacht while he was again wearing shorts. It was unusual protocol in a public meeting for a member of the family that rules a hyperconservative Islamic kingdom.The arrests also come as Crown Prince Mohammed has forged a close relationship with President Trump, who shares his aggressive approach to Saudi\u2019s regional rival, Iran, and his penchant for bold decisions.But despite his wealth, Prince Alwaleed was not seen as particularly powerful within the Saudi royal family or as a threat to the crown prince\u2019s consolidation of power. His father, Prince Talal, known as the \u201cRed Prince,\u201d spent years in exile after leading a kind of leftist revolt among royals in 1962, and had grumbled in the past about being passed over in the royal succession. Prince Alwaleed himself initially objected to the naming of Mohammed as crown prince, though he quickly stopped complaining in public.A more likely reason for his inclusion in the arrests, experts said, is that he might have gone bankrupt during the 2008 financial crisis. He had been highly leveraged and somehow got elements of the government to bail him out, through his connections to then-King Abdullah and the finance minister, who is also said to have been arrested. Prince Alwaleed\u2019s son Prince Khaled is married to the minister\u2019s daughter.\u201cThey must have uncovered evidence of irregular activity and wanted to make an example of him,\u201d Ali Shihabi, founder of the independent Arabia Foundation in Washington, said on Sunday from Abu Dhabi in a telephone interview.Others said there was bad blood between Prince Alwaleed and the crown prince. A former United States ambassador, Chas W. Freeman Jr., said it could be that Prince Alwaleed \u201chas been strongly identified in Saudi with civil society, which is by its very nature a counter to concentration of power.\u201d\u201cHe has a reputation,\u201d Mr. Freeman said, \u201cfor being quite outspoken and blunt and being critical of other parts of the royal family \u2014 and he\u2019s not well liked.\u201dOthers said they were surprised at the takedown of someone who has been an ambassador to international business.\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything about Alwaleed being politically active in a way that would threaten M.B.S.,\u201d said F. Gregory Gause III, an expert on Saudi Arabia and a professor at Texas A&M University, referring to the crown prince by his initials.Saudi Arabia is also trying to diversify its economy, a top priority of the crown prince. The kingdom is planning to list the state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco next year in what is expected to be the biggest initial public offering in history.He comes across in person as relaxed, not formal or rigid, and focused on business. A New York Times reporter who visited his office years ago found towering pictures of his daughter, without a head scarf. The prince\u2019s welcome was typical of his grand gestures: He presented the reporter, visiting in the days before the internet, with a full-length printout of The Times.More recently, Prince Alwaleed made early bets on some of the technology world\u2019s biggest stars, earning him handsome returns. He bought a strategic stake in JD.com, a Chinese online retailer, anticipating China\u2019s emergence as a vast e-commerce market.In moments of corporate crises, Prince Alwaleed has stepped in to tip the balance.When the phone hacking scandal rocked a London tabloid owned by the Murdochs, the prince went on the BBC to say that Rebekah Brooks, then the chief executive of the British unit of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation, should resign. \u201cYou bet she has to go,\u201d he said in July 2011. She resigned the next day.At the time, Prince Alwaleed was the second-biggest shareholder in News Corporation, with a more than 6 percent stake. He later sold most of his stake in the company.In the darkest hours of the 2008 financial crisis, Prince Alwaleed said he would increase his stake in Citigroup \u2014 a move of solidarity with the then-embattled bank\u2019s chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit.Prince Alwaleed has worked closely with some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest and best known banks and investors.Just a month ago, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, sat across from Prince Alwaleed at a meeting in Riyadh. The two talked about investments and economic developments in the Middle East. A longtime banker for Kingdom Holding, Goldman Sachs recently helped Prince Alwaleed\u2019s company acquire a 16 percent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi, the Saudi bank.Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and former government official who fled into exile during the summer, said Prince Alwaleed had lately become a vocal supporter of the crown prince\u2019s economic reforms and tried to persuade him to return to the country. Mr. Khashoggi said the prince sent him a text message saying, \u201cAn enlightened mind like you should be with us now building the fourth Saudi state under Mohammed bin Salman.\u201dBut Prince Mohammad appeared to have been keeping his distance, delaying four months before granting a requested meeting, Mr. Khashoggi said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m sure that hurt him. But Alwaleed is royalist. He believes in the solidarity of the royal family.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong, Anne Barnard from Beirut, Lebanon, and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow.

{"Headline": "Soothsayer in the Hills Sees Silicon Valley\u2019s Sinister Side", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith ... Jaron LanierBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 Jaron Lanier is the most unusual person I\u2019ve ever met.And I\u2019ve met a lot of unusual people.\u201cI\u2019m a professional illusionist,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways, I might know more about making illusions than anybody.\u201dMr. Lanier is one of the few prophets who admits that the spawn of Silicon Valley could become evil, but he tries to stay on the sunny side. It helps that he avoids all social media.\u201cThe popular ones are designed for behavior modification,\u201d he says, wearing his usual black T-shirt and black pants. \u201cIt\u2019s like, why would you go sign up for an evil hypnotist who\u2019s explicitly saying that his whole purpose is to get you to do things that people have paid him to get you to do, but he won\u2019t tell you who they are?\u201dAt this moment when dark clouds loom over Silicon Valley, Mr. Lanier is able to talk about the Lords of the Cloud with affection yet candor, as he worries that these tech gods creating new worlds may be getting \u201chigh on their own supply.\u201d\u201cThis is such a scary time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says, in his sweet, breathy voice. \u201cI mean, it is for me. I had always feared we would create this social-manipulation technology out of computers.\u201dIn his forthcoming memoir, \u201cDawn of the New Everything: Encounters With Reality and Virtual Reality,\u201d the Microsoft wizard enthuses that VR \u201cweds the nerdy thing with the hippie mystic thing,\u201d high-tech but like a dream and \u201can elixir of unbounded experience.\u201dBut he\u2019s well aware of the \u201cMatrix\u201d dangers. He realized early on, he writes, that \u201cit could turn out to be the evilest invention of all time.\u201dIt\u2019s a pretty simple proposition, he tells me: \u201cIf you control the person\u2019s reality, you control the person.\u201d Or as he writes in the book, \u201cNever has a medium been so potent for beauty and so vulnerable to creepiness.\u201dRecently, the creepiness has been on display.Mark Zuckerberg stumbled into more trouble for tone-deafness when he used his cartoon avatar to take a disaster adventure trip, a \u201cmagical\u201d 360-degree virtual reality tour of hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico to promote his new Facebook Spaces app.\u201cOh, God,\u201d Mr. Lanier said when he saw it. \u201cIt is scary and awful how out of touch Silicon Valley people have become.\u201dThe story also noted that, given how lifelike the technology is, \u201ccertainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual reality sex constitutes cheating.\u201dMr. Lanier, who discourses eloquently on subjects like limerence and lust in his book, says: \u201cThe future I\u2019d prefer to see is one where people use VR together to make really crazy imaginative experiences that might be sexual or might not. Where you turn into fantastical creatures and that sort of thing. Or when your bodies merge in some ways. That to me is so much more interesting than the porn. Porn is a product of the cinema era. It\u2019s an old-fashioned way of thinking, locked in the 19th century.\u201dMore and more, we are wondering why, when we know the top Silicon Valley companies are not benevolent, we invite them into the most intimate areas of our lives, as Scott Galloway asks in \u201cThe Four,\u201d a book about how Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are refashioning the world. \u201cAre these entities the Four Horsemen of god, love, sex, and consumption?\u201d Mr. Galloway wonders. \u201cOr are they the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse?\u201dEven though he\u2019s prone to whimsical, esoteric tangents, I know I can get a straight answer on that from Mr. Lanier.We sit down at his dining room table amid a wild cornucopia of stuff, including a lamp with a hot pink feathered shade and black cats lounging on chairs and hanging, Cirque du Soleil-style, from carpeted staircases. There are also musical instruments \u2014 a golden Wurlitzer pedal harp; a rare pre-Depression Mason & Hamlin piano that Mr. Lanier says has \u201ca uniquely American sound,\u201d a 19th-century Chinese opium bed filled with saxophones, flutes, clarinets, lutes and ouds; mandolins covering the walls, and over a thousand more instruments, from a medieval cornetto to a shakuhachi, a Japanese flute \u2014 all of which Mr. Lanier can play.Like his house, his new book is crammed full of strange and mesmerizing stuff.Right after he was born, his mother, a Marlene Dietrich look-alike and Viennese pianist and stock trader who had talked her way out of a concentration camp by passing as Aryan, and his father, whose family had been mostly wiped out in Ukrainian pogroms, took Jaron someplace they thought would be safe: the westernmost corner of Texas. There, he had to confront more than his share of bullies growing up, once by swinging a baritone horn at them.His mother died when he was about 9, when her car flipped over on the freeway as she was coming back from getting her driver\u2019s license. His father, who worked for a time as the science editor of \u201cAmazing,\u201d \u201cFantastic\u201d and \u201cAstounding\u201d pulp science-fiction magazines, then let his 11-year-old son design their new house in New Mexico: a geodesic dome.The design, Mr. Lanier writes, looked \u201ca little like a woman\u2019s body. You could see the big dome as a pregnant belly and the two icosahedrons as breasts.\u201dHe tosses out that his father may have been the one to start the rumor about alligators in the sewers of New York.After a takeout chicken and macaroni dinner, Mr. Lanier bids a loving good night to his wife, Lena, a child psychologist, and their 11-year old daughter, Lilibell. Then he brings out his Microsoft HoloLens headsets and a big mug of chocolate milk. \u201cI\u2019m more like the child than the parent, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he says.I spend some time wearing the headset painting graffiti in the air with my hand, and Mr. Lanier explains why the brain can see more than the eyes.\u201cExpect some smelly feet,\u201d Mr. Lanier says.Unlike many here, he does not think of humans as ants in his experiments.\u201cHopefully, in this period, when we\u2019re dealing with this really crude and early stuff like Facebook feeds, Instagram, Snapchat,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019ll be able to get the politics straight and find a path for people to have dignity and autonomy before the hard-core stuff comes. Unless we all kill ourselves through this other stuff, which is a possibility, too. One of the great joys of the Trump era is having your 11-year-old say, \u2018The former head of NATO said there\u2019s a one in 10 chance of nuclear war. Is that right?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, great. Thank you, Trump. That\u2019s very nice.\u2019\u201dMr. Lanier believes that Facebook and Google, with their \u201ctop-down control schemes,\u201d should be called \u201cBehavior Modification Empires.\u201d\u201cThe whole internet thing was supposed to create the world\u2019s best information resource in all of history,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything would be made visible. And instead we\u2019re living in this time of total opacity where you don\u2019t know why you see the news you see. You don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same news that someone else sees. You don\u2019t know who made it be that way. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s paid to change what you see. Everything is totally obscure in a profound way that it never was before.\u201cAnd the belief system of Silicon Valley is so thick that my friends at Facebook simply still really believe that the answer to any problem is to do more of what they already did, that they\u2019re optimizing the world.\u201cThe Facebook business model is mass behavior modification for pay. And for those who are not giving Facebook money, the only \u2014 and I want to emphasize, the only, underlined and in bold and italics \u2014 reward they can get or positive feedback is just getting attention. And if you have a system where the only possible prize is getting more attention, then you call that system Christmas for Asses, right? It\u2019s a creep-amplification device.\u201cOnce Facebook becomes ubiquitous, it\u2019s a sort of giant protection racket, where, if you don\u2019t pay them money, then someone else will pay to modify the behavior to your disadvantage, so everyone has to pay money just to stay at equilibrium where they would have been otherwise,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s only one way out for Facebook, which is to change its business model. Unless Facebook changes, we\u2019ll just have to trust Facebook for any future election result. Because they do apparently have the ability to change them. Or at least change the close ones.\u201dWhy would Facebook change its business model when it\u2019s raking in billions?\u201cI would appeal to the decency of the people in it,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd if not to them, then the toughness of the regulators. It\u2019s going to be one of the struggles of the century.\u201dI point out that after the stunning Trump win, President Obama took Mr. Zuckerberg aside and warned him to take the threat of political disinformation seriously, but the young billionaire dismissed the idea that it was widespread.\u201cWell, no one in Silicon Valley believes that anybody knows more than us,\u201d Mr. Lanier says dryly. \u201cSurely not the government.\u201dHe continues: \u201cI think there are a lot of good people at Facebook, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re evil as individuals. Or at least not the ones that I\u2019ve met. And I know Google a lot better, and I feel pretty certain that they\u2019re not evil. But both of these companies have this behavior-manipulation business plan, which is just not something the world can sustain at that scale. It just makes everything crazy.\u201dI remark that Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg expressed surprise that their fiendish little invention could do something so nefarious.\u201cPeople in the community knew,\u201d Mr. Lanier says, adding that he wrote essays and participated in debates in the early 1990s about how easy it would be the create unreality and manipulate society, how you could put out a feed of information that would put people in illusory worlds where they thought they had sought out the information but actually they had been guided \u201cthe way a magician forces a card.\u201d\u201cSo for somebody to say they didn\u2019t know the algorithms could do that,\u201d Mr. Lanier says in a disbelieving tone. \u201cIf somebody didn\u2019t know, they should\u2019ve known.\u201dSo what happens when fake news marries virtual reality?\u201cIt could be much more significant,\u201d Mr. Lanier says. \u201cWhen you look at all the ways of manipulating people that you can do with just a crude thing like a Facebook feed \u2014 when people are just looking at images and text on their phones and they\u2019re not really inside synthetic worlds yet \u2014 when you can do it with virtual reality, it\u2019s like total control of the person. So what I\u2019m hoping is that we\u2019re going to figure this stuff out so we don\u2019t make ourselves insane before virtual reality becomes mature.\u201dHe says that Silicon Valley has turned out both better and worse than he expected: \u201cAs far as the worse part, creating a global behavior-modification empire is worse than I thought. And creating a world that\u2019s more opaque instead of less opaque is worse than I thought we should do. It\u2019s also a physically uglier place than I thought it would be. It\u2019s really a shame. If we\u2019re the new Renaissance, why don\u2019t we make this amazing Tuscany here? We have these gorgeous orchards. Why don\u2019t we do something beautiful here instead of just filling it up with parking lots and horrible buildings?\u201dHe says sometimes his peers in the Valley seem perfectly nice but then they will say something \u201cI just can\u2019t believe.\u201d He cites Eric Schmidt\u2019s comment on privacy on CNBC\u2019s \u201cInside the Mind of Google\u201d special in 2009, that \u201cIf you have something that you don\u2019t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Mr. Lanier asks. \u201cIt does give me this feeling sometimes that something\u2019s going wrong with our culture in Silicon Valley and maybe it\u2019s just that thing of power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely, just losing perspective. Like Zuckerberg might think, \u2018Well, I went around to a bunch of states and I ate barbecue and wrestled cattle so I\u2019ve been around all kinds of people.\u2019 But to have people who you respect and listen to have fundamentally different worldviews and question your core logic and think that you may be way off track, that\u2019s a much harder thing to do. And there are people who can be very powerful and comfortable with that. I\u2019ll mention one, whose name is Barack Obama.\u201dI ask Mr. Lanier about the sexual harassment and gender inequity problems roiling the Valley.\u201cWell, sometimes, I think there\u2019s a kind of emerging new male jerk persona of the digital age, which would be some kind of a cross between the Uber guy and the pharma bro and maybe Milo Yiannopoulos and maybe Palmer Luckey and maybe Steve Bannon,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause, there\u2019s this sort of smug, superior, \u2018I\u2019ve got the levers of power, and I know better than you.\u2019 It\u2019s sort of this weird combination of a lot of power and a lot of insecurity at the same time.\u201d He believes that Gamergate led to the alt right. \u201cIt was one of the feeders,\u201d he says.He talks about another personality that is emerging from the digital age.\u201cIf you\u2019re a mark of social media, if you\u2019re being manipulated by it, one of the ways to tell is if there\u2019s a certain kind of personality quality that overtakes you,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been called the snowflake quality. People criticize liberal college kids who have it, but it\u2019s exactly the same thing you see in Trump. It\u2019s this kind of highly reactive, thin-skinned, outraged single-mindedness. I think one way to think of Trump, even though he is a con man and he is an actor and he\u2019s a master manipulator and all that, in a sense he\u2019s also a victim. I\u2019ve met him a few times over 30 years. And what I think I see is someone who has moved from kind of a New York character who was in on his own joke to somebody who is completely freaked out and outraged and feeling like he is on the verge of a catastrophe every second. And so my theory about that is that he was ruined by social media.\u201dMr. Lanier plays me a song he composed to cheer up his wife when she was going through cancer treatments, a Cuban-style charanga flute solo played on a Japanese shakuhachi \u2014 \u201cwhich is a crazy-hard thing to do and I pulled it off.\u201dThen he confides his fear that one of his older cats, Loof, would have been a Trump supporter.\u201cLoof is the sweetest cat in the world but she\u2019s really an anti-immigrant voter,\u201d he says. \u201cShe did not like the idea of young cats coming here. She really didn\u2019t want the change. She really felt like they ruined everything. And I must point out that the new kittens who came are black kittens. They appear to be Bombay cats. Loof is not in a basket of deplorables. She\u2019s just in a basket of blankets.\u201dAs I get ready to leave, the grand illusionist offers an intriguing theory about why the internet is more obsessed with cats than dogs.\u201cI think we know that Facebook is turning us into trained dogs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know we\u2019re being trained. We can feel ourselves being turned into trained circus animals. And we long for that independence that cats show. So when you look at a cat video, what you\u2019re really seeing is this receding identity that you want to cling to and find again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Qualcomm Became Vulnerable to a Takeover Bid", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySteven Mollenkopf, the chief executive of the chip maker Qualcomm, views the company\u2019s recent patent dispute with Apple and antitrust scrutiny from regulators worldwide as elaborate price negotiations.When asked about the bitter conflict with Apple, which has battered Qualcomm\u2019s profits, Mr. Mollenkopf said his company\u2019s position was simple: There is a contract in place.\u201cThat contract has been in existence for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not really anything new going on.\u201dBut a lot about the cellphone industry has changed since that contract was signed nearly a decade ago. Those shifts, including the companies that dominate the industry, help explain the challenges Qualcomm faces from big customers like Apple and Samsung and antitrust watchdogs around the globe.Several forces are working against Qualcomm, including the rise of China as both the dominant smartphone manufacturer and a huge consumer market, and the growing clout of the Apple and Samsung brands.But perhaps as much as anything, the smartphone inventions that attract consumers today are not provided by Qualcomm.In earlier generations of products, faster wireless connections sold new phones. Today, people walk into stores looking for an Apple iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, and ask about features like the size of the screen, the camera, and its memory and storage capacity.\u201cAll these technologies have little or nothing to do with Qualcomm,\u201d said Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet. \u201cThe landscape, the environment has changed.\u201dThese technologies have enriched the smartphone experience and driven up the price, especially for top-of-the-line iPhones and Galaxy models.But what has generally not changed is Qualcomm\u2019s licensing formula \u2014 typically charging fees of about 5 percent of the wholesale price of a phone, analysts say, even though its technology accounts for less of the value of many smartphone models.That position has increasingly irritated big customers like Apple and Samsung and contract manufacturers like Foxconn, which is Apple\u2019s major supplier. (The contract manufacturers are usually the ones that directly pay fees to Qualcomm, and receive pass-through payments from Apple and others.)The other Qualcomm practice that has prompted scrutiny from various antitrust investigators is charging smartphone makers license fees whether or not they use Qualcomm chips, because of the strength of its patents.As part of the settlement, Qualcomm agreed to license some of its patents to Chinese handset makers at lower rates. Analysts estimate that Qualcomm\u2019s overall royalty rates in China were cut by as much as half, to about 2.5 percent.The settlement allowed Qualcomm to keep operating in the vast Chinese market and smoothed relations with government officials there. This week, Mr. Mollenkopf is traveling with President Trump in China.In other antitrust cases, Qualcomm paid South Korea $853 million in December and Taiwan $773 million last month.In the United States, an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission is underway. Shortly after the commission\u2019s move in January, Apple sued Qualcomm, claiming unfair patent-licensing practices.Apple declined to comment on its chip plans or how a Broadcom acquisition might affect its patent suit against Qualcomm. Analysts say Apple has already been exploring whether to work with other chip makers, or design its own chips.Already, though, Apple is not making pass-through payments to its contract manufacturers for Qualcomm royalty payments. In turn, those payments \u2014 an estimated $2.5 billion a year \u2014 are not made to Qualcomm. Qualcomm has said another major company, which it has not named, has stopped paying license fees of $1 billion a year.In the fiscal year ended in September, the company reported net income of $2.5 billion, less than half of the $5.7 billion in the previous year.\u201cThings went off the cliff pretty quickly, mainly because of Apple,\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research.Mr. Mollenkopf, 48, has worked at Qualcomm for more than two decades, starting as a bench engineer. He is the first chief executive of Qualcomm who was not part of the founding family. Irwin Jacobs co-founded Qualcomm in 1985 and headed the company until 2005, when his son Paul became chief executive. Paul Jacobs is executive chairman today.Mr. Mollenkopf was elevated to the top job in 2014, after his name surfaced as a candidate to succeed Steven Ballmer as chief executive of Microsoft. Analysts say he has been a champion of Qualcomm\u2019s efforts to build a third large business alongside patent licensing and chips.\u201cHe really understands that Qualcomm\u2019s future depends on its ability to diversify beyond its core smartphone heartland,\u201d said Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight, a technology research firm.Past efforts faltered. For example, Qualcomm invested hundreds of millions of dollars in a unit called MediaFlo, which tried to develop a content delivery service for smartphones. It folded that business, but did sell much of the unit\u2019s assets and technology to AT&T for $1.9 billion in 2010.Qualcomm\u2019s big bet for the future is 5G technology. The next generation of wireless communications technology holds the potential to connect billions of devices to the internet, from cars to sensor-filled clothes.A pending $39 billion purchase of NXP, whose specialized chips with beefed-up security are used in some cars and mobile payment systems, would be a big step toward that hoped-for third leg. The deal has been slowed by regulatory reviews.In a conference call with analysts last week, Mr. Mollenkopf pointed to the 5G future, declaring that Qualcomm was \u201cleading the industry.\u201dThe 5G story is likely to play a prominent role in Qualcomm\u2019s effort to stay independent or at least drive up the price Broadcom eventually pays.\u201cIts strongest hand is the promise of 5G and that its leadership position will lead to an explosion of demand for its technology,\u201d said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, who has written case studies on Qualcomm.Still, 5G devices are not expected to reach the market in volume until 2019 \u2014 and the patience of Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders is uncertain.Don Clark contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Start of the Season", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplayTUESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 If you\u2019re going to have an existential crisis, having one over words and their value in crossword puzzles is probably as good a reason as any to have one.This goes double if it inspires a person to make his debut in The New York Times Crossword.While this is an interesting idea, I wish there had been one or two fewer theme entries and better nontheme fill. There are a lot of three letter gluey bits in the grid, but I think that as Mr. Poulos gains more experience and fine-tunes his word lists, that will get better, especially since he seems to be aware of the issue to begin with.What a great idea for a theme! Given the word-nerdy kinship between neologism watchers and crossword lovers, I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s the first time this theme has been attempted.The American Dialect Society has been awarding Word of the Year honors since 1990, but maybe it took this long for the stars to align just right \u2014 after all, the last two WOTY winners, SINGULAR THEY (2015) and DUMPSTER FIRE (2016), are nicely symmetrical (12 letters, with the same 8-4 enumeration).34A: The start of the season, other than the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade, is TIS, as is \u201cTis the season.\u201d26D: \u201cApril Fools sign?\u201d is not looking for sign of a prank, but of the astrological sign for April 1. That would be ARIES.This puzzle came about as a result of a minor philosophical crisis.I\u2019d read a blog post where the author was complaining about a puzzle that he felt \u201clacked fresh fill.\u201d This complaint surprised me, because I\u2019d personally found the puzzle in question to be quite lively.It got me wondering: what do we mean when we talk about \u201cfresh fill\u201d? What separates perfectly O.K., workhorse words from gnarly crosswordese? Can clever cluing turn a stale word fresh? And when does a word go from \u201cfresh\u201d to faddish, twee, or just plain annoying?I soon began to doubt everything I knew about cruciverbalism and, indeed, language itself.Around the same time, I read on Language Log (a blog run by an international supergroup of academic linguists) that the American Dialect Society had recently announced \u201cDUMPSTER FIRE\u201d as their 2016 Word of the Year. It struck me that if there were one word everyone could agree on as \u201cfresh,\u201d surely it\u2019d be the A.D.S. Word of the Year.So I made a puzzle based on that idea.My initial plan was to seed the past several years\u2019 winners anywhere I could fit them into a grid. But when I looked at the WotY list, I realized the word lengths might allow for symmetric placement. Luckily, I was able to pull it off.I\u2019m super-duper thrilled for this to be my debut puzzle in The Times. Thanks to my friends and family (especially Cliff, Nick, and the Daves Madden and Sheppard) for their support and feedback. Thanks also to Mr. Shortz for actually accepting this thing, and editing the clues to be better and more consistent overall.My only regret is that UHF is no longer clued as \u201c1989 \u2018Weird Al\u2019 film set at a low-budget TV station.\u201dMaybe this will make you feel better, Mr. Poulos. If nothing else, it will bring back the 1980s for you in a big way:Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
