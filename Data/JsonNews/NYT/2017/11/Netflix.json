This ultimately results in higher prices and lower quality service for consumers.\u201dAT&T/DirecTV executives have concluded that the \u201crunway\u201d for the decline of traditional payTV \u201cmay be longer than some think given the economics of the space,\u201d and that it is \u201cupon us to utilize our assets to extend that runway.\u201dAT&T itself has previously stated that access to some of the most popular television programming is \u201ccritical to preserve and promote competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming.\u201d\u201cAfter reviewing DOJ\u2019s lawsuit against AT&T-Time Warner and watching AT&T\u2019s press conference, we still see a settlement as possible and, failing that, we believe AT&T would prevail in court.\u201d\u201cUnder my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,\u201d F.C.C. chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that\u2019s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate.\u201dThe move is a win for the giant telecoms like AT&T and Verizon as well as the big cable providers such as Comcast.\u201cThe losers could be internet sites that will have to answer telecom firms to get their content in front of consumers. And consumers may see their bills increase for the best quality of internet service.\u201dAndrew worked the phones yesterday and hears:Media executives at the other big content and distribution providers privately tell me that they hope AT&T and Time Warner do not find a way to settle. They are confident that the companies will win in court and hope that would put pressure on the Justice Department as it examines future deals.The telecommunications giant and its peers have lobbied hard against the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to prevent broadband providers from charging higher fees to access particular websites or online services like Netflix. Now the F.C.C. under Chairman Ajit Pai is poised to roll those initiatives back.Mr. Pai plans to accompany the repeal of net neutrality with several other measures that will also benefit broadband companies, said the people with knowledge of the matter. That includes suggesting that the Federal Trade Commission, which has traditionally not brought many cases, be the enforcement agency of net neutrality violations, they said.\u201cIt\u2019s not completely irrational to say the tax code is a disaster,\u201d Mr. Rattner said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here is that the importance of reforming the tax code trumps, excuse the pun, fixing the debt.\u201dBut Pete Peterson, the Blackstone co-founder and perhaps the most outspoken billionaire on the issue of the federal deficit, is having none of it. He told Andrew:\u201cMortgaging our fiscal future for trillions in temporary tax cuts will hurt our economy over time, and every C.E.O. should know that,\u201d he said. \u201cTrue business patriots need to advocate for their country as well as their company.\u201dThe European Union has already decided to move top regulatory agencies outside of London: The European Medicines Agency will leave London for Amsterdam, while the European Banking Authority will relocate to Paris.Its deal to buy as many as 24,000 self-driving Volvo vehicles reflects the ride-hailing giant\u2019s broad ambitions to make autonomous driving part of its future.\u201cThe only way we could control our own destiny was to work with this technology that had the potential to disrupt our business, and have direct involvement in the creation of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Murdoch essentially created Sky in 1989, and the news channel was started the same year. Analysts have long believed that the media mogul would seek to take full control of the company.The takeover of Sky would give 21st Century Fox control of a Pan-European satellite network, as well as rights to additional content such as broadcasts of the English Premier League and other soccer leagues in parts of Europe. It would also help the American company take on digital rivals like Netflix and Amazon, whose streaming services are increasingly being used by customers on mobile devices.Mr. Murdoch tried to buy full control of Sky years ago, but that effort was abandoned as furor grew over a hacking scandal at the company, which was known then News Corporation. Since then, Mr. Murdoch split off 21st Century Fox from the rest of News Corp.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How ABC Found a Surprise Hit in \u2018The Good Doctor\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDaniel Dae Kim was wide awake and scrolling through Twitter at 4 a.m. when he realized \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d was going to be a hit.It was a Tuesday in September, and Mr. Kim, a 49-year-old actor known for his work on \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d and \u201cLost,\u201d found himself in bed in western Bulgaria not far from the set of \u201cHellboy,\u201d a movie he was filming for release next year.He had a special interest in \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d because it represented his first outing in a new role: executive producer. And so, although he had to go to work in just a few hours, he could not keep himself from checking the effusive social-media reaction to the show\u2019s premiere episode on ABC.When Mr. Kim stumbled onto the \u201cHellboy\u201d set in the morning, he felt just fine. \u201cI\u2019ve lived with this project since 2013, so one night of lost sleep wasn\u2019t going to make a difference,\u201d he said, laughing.The tweets Mr. Kim scrolled through that night would soon give way to hard data: ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d is the most watched drama on network television. With roughly 17 million viewers for each episode, according to the Nielsen ratings, it draws a bigger audience than the CBS crime show \u201cNCIS\u201d and NBC\u2019s weepy \u201cThis is Us.\u201dThe surprise hit has been a boon to ABC, which has been stuck in last place among the big four networks. It also came as sweet relief to Mr. Kim, who had spent three years developing this adaptation of a South Korean show through his 3AD production company.The show can be soapy and even a little gory. Because the protagonist speaks haltingly at times, onscreen graphics show how his beautiful mind goes at the job of deconstructing a troubled liver or heart.\u201cThis could have been terrible in the wrong hands, or lesser hands,\u201d said David Shore, an executive producer on the series, of Mr. Highmore. \u201cHe brings a humanity to this character that isn\u2019t necessarily on the page.\u201dOn Dec. 4, the show will wrap the first half of its improbably successful debut season. For every medical-genre hit like the NBC juggernaut \u201cER\u201d or the ABC stalwart \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d there are scores that never make it past season one (Remember \u201cHeartbeat,\u201d \u201cTrauma\u201d or \u201cMercy?\u201d No one else does, either.)Mr. Kim took notice of the original version of \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d an award-winning 20-episode series in South Korea, not long after it started airing in 2013. He scooped up the rights for his new production company and got to work adapting it. Because he was a star of the CBS show \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d at the time, he developed it for his home network, which ordered up a script. After taking a look, however, CBS decided against commissioning a pilot.That is usually the stage when all parties agree to leave a project behind, but Mr. Kim, who was born in South Korea and grew up in Bethlehem, Pa., bought back the rights from CBS. He felt that strongly about it.He eventually teamed up with Sony\u2019s television arm, which brought in Mr. Shore, the creator of the successful Fox medical drama \u201cHouse.\u201d Mr. Shore\u2019s version began to attract network interest \u2014 although not from CBS.\u201cCBS actually passed on it twice,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cThat was really unfortunate to me, because they were my home studio. I really wanted to bring something home to them.\u201d\u201cThe path to equality is never easy,\u201d Mr. Kim wrote in a Facebook post at the time.In the end, CBS lost a prime time actor and ABC gained an executive producer who brought it an unexpected hit.Enter, \u201cThe Good Doctor.\u201dThe show is partly the result of a programming strategy that ABC hit upon last year, after heartland voters had a strong hand in the election of President Trump \u2014 a strategy focused on \u201cnot just appealing to both coasts,\u201d said Ben Sherwood, the president of the Disney and ABC television group.Indeed, ABC executives and producers for the show are convinced that Dr. Shaun Murphy, the main character of \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d plays to a wide audience because he is innocent and never meanspirited. While the median age of the show\u2019s viewers is 58, according to Nielsen, it is also popular among teenage girls.\u201cHe\u2019s a hero we haven\u2019t really seen lately,\u201d Mr. Shore said of Dr. Murphy. \u201cHe\u2019s overcoming things he was born with. He\u2019s not a drinker. He\u2019s not a womanizer. He\u2019s not an antihero.\u201dMr. Kim said it was perhaps a \u201cblessing in disguise\u201d that \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d did not get picked up in, say, 2014, when it may have fallen flat. \u201cThere a lot of shows that have a deeply cynical take on the world,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cThis is not one of them. Given what I was reading every day in newspapers or seeing on my TV, I felt it was very much needed counterprogramming to reality.\u201dMr. Highmore, the lead actor, came aboard after playing Norman Bates on the A&E series \u201cBates Motel.\u201d He had a break of only a few weeks between playing a psychotic killer and a good-hearted savant who wants to save lives.\u201cHe always tries to see the good in people,\u201d Mr. Highmore said. \u201cHe\u2019s not cynical, he\u2019s not judgmental. In the times we are living in now, having someone with such a positive outlook in the world is refreshing and joyful.\u201dWhether or not the main reason for its success has to do with the times or the show itself, \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d is ABC\u2019s highest-rated first-year hit since \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d in 2004 and the best broadcast performer at 10 p.m. in the past 11 years. And now the fourth-place network has something to build on.\u201cThe way to turn a schedule around is brick by brick,\u201d Ms. Dungey said. \u201cWhat\u2019s very exciting about the success of \u2018The Good Doctor\u2019 is that it feels like that\u2019s a very strong brick for us.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the date when \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d would wrap the first half of its debut season.

{"Headline": "Why Blocking the AT&T-Time Warner Merger Might Be Right", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut should we so quickly conclude that the Justice Department is doing something wrong? Maybe not.We don\u2019t have the information that the Justice Department has, but here\u2019s how the Time Warner-AT&T deal would be anticompetitive. AT&T is one of the two dominant wireless carriers in the United States (Verizon is the other). However, it faces competitive threats, particularly from T-Mobile, whose cost-cutting and ability to lure subscribers has hurt AT&T\u2019s profits (while saving consumers money). During the Obama era, AT&T\u2019s proposed solution to that annoyance was to attempt to buy T-Mobile. But the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission killed that deal. Acquiring Time Warner is an alternative: It gives AT&T a new way to hurt T-Mobile and other potential competitive threats.AT&T\u2019s 2016 deal with Taylor Swift offers a preview of the strategy. AT&T made an \u201conly on AT&T\u201d deal with Ms. Swift to release her future music videos to devoted fans, contingent on their signing up with AT&T. With ownership of Time Warner, AT&T gets a lot more content with which to play that game. It would include HBO shows like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Warner Bros. movies like the \u201cBatman\u201d franchise, as well as the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and CNN.Though restricting HBO to just AT&T customers wouldn\u2019t make financial sense, there are many things that AT&T could do with HBO and other programming to hurt rivals, like raising the prices for it, creating AT&T-exclusive programming and perhaps completely preventing rivals like Dish, DirecTV\u2019s satellite competitor, from buying its programs. This strategy would take advantage of the erosion or revocation of net-neutrality rules by the Trump administration, allowing AT&T to explicitly favor its own content over others.There are numerous political and free speech concerns that come when those who control \u201cthe pipes\u201d that distribute content also control the programming and news operations. Companies that controlled both the distribution and production of news programs could have enough power to influence elections. In theory, the F.C.C. should intervene to prevent such abuses, but the current commission has shown zero interest in what was once called \u201cthe public interest.\u201dIn short, there are good reasons for the Justice Department to be concerned about this merger. Yes, the department over the past two decades has allowed many mega-mergers or taken tepid steps to restrict them through consent decrees. But the department is capable of learning from its mistakes, and the consensus now is that consent decrees don\u2019t work. Moreover, in recent years the department has blocked several big mergers, including between Comcast and Time Warner Cable, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, and Anthem and Cigna. Tough scrutiny of an AT&T-Time Warner deal would continue that trend.The unfortunate fact is that Mr. Trump has engendered so much distrust in government that everything that any federal agency does these days seems questionable. The problem is compounded by the extreme secrecy that has surrounded merger reviews. In fact, the secrecy surrounding mergers exceeds that for almost any other public process with major economic impact. Even the Federal Reserve occasionally explains its decisions to Congress.If the Justice Department is, in fact, doing its job appropriately and not behaving as Mr. Trump\u2019s henchman, it should be willing to show us how. It ought to explain its concerns about the merger to the public and to Congress.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the companies in a merger blocked by the Justice Department. The attempted merger would have been of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, not Comcast and Time Warner.Tim Wu, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads,\u201d is a professor at Columbia Law School and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington Has Delivered a Tangled Message on AT&T\u2019s Power", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "Loosening rules on internet providers would let big companies charge more for their services. But a suit to block a merger signals a tougher stance against big business.Supported byIn a matter of hours this week, the Trump administration twice weighed in on one of the central issues shaping business and society today \u2014 just how much market power big companies should be allowed to amass.Yet in back-to-back developments, two federal agencies arrived at starkly different conclusions, and one company, AT&T, found itself on opposite sides of the debate.In each development, there are signs that the Trump administration is trying to reckon with a media and telecommunications industry that has become intensely concentrated in recent years; most Americans now get their internet and phone services from one of a few providers, and most TV shows and movies are produced by a handful of big companies.But there is so far no clear view about how Washington will navigate this constantly shifting terrain in the future.\u201cWe have one government, but two separate agencies with opposing views,\u201d said Spencer Kurn, an analyst at New Street Research. \u201cYou\u2019ve got one agency saying that marrying content and distribution results in too much market power, and another agency saying there\u2019s no problem with a distributor favoring their content over someone else\u2019s.\u201dAT&T stands to gain from the rollback of net neutrality rules. It could charge companies and consumers more for high-speed internet access, and use its market influence to hinder content providers it competes against.\u201cIt\u2019s an \u2018open the champagne bottles\u2019 moment for AT&T,\u201d said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia University who coined the term net neutrality \u2014 the concept of providing equal access to the internet. \u201cThey can just tell people to pony up.\u201dBut AT&T\u2019s long-term aspirations could be dealt a severe blow if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking its takeover of Time Warner.On Tuesday, President Trump signaled his approval of the lawsuit. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve always felt that that was a deal that\u2019s not good for the country,\u201d he said in response to a question from reporters. If the merger was approved, he suggested, \u201cI think your pricing is going to go up.\u201dFor all the good a rollback of net neutrality rules would do AT&T, the company is looking to diversify. Its core businesses of delivering phone, internet and satellite television services are maturing. A big move into the content business would expand the company\u2019s sources of revenue, and give it new opportunities for cost savings.One of AT&T\u2019s biggest competitors, Comcast, has already married content and distribution with the acquisition of NBCUniversal. If the government succeeds in preventing the Time Warner deal, it will raise sharp questions about the future of AT&T, and its competitors.\u201cThis could be a watershed event for future business combinations in media,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. \u201cDoes this mean Comcast will be broken up?\u201dThere is no evidence that the decisions by the Justice Department and the F.C.C. were coordinated.Instead, the diverging decisions reflect an effort by different agencies trying to come to grips with a radically transformed media and telecommunications landscape, one where Silicon Valley companies are suddenly powerhouses in content creation, and traditional media companies exert vast influence over how information flows across the internet.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely getting mixed messages from the administration,\u201d said Larry Downes, project director for the Center for Business and Public Policy at Georgetown University.The Justice Department\u2019s decision to intervene in the AT&T deal was the more surprising of the two developments this week. Many antitrust experts believe that the government\u2019s case against the deal is weak, because it is a so-called vertical merger, bringing together two businesses that do not compete directly with each other.But the lawsuit is a sign that the Justice Department is beginning to think about antitrust enforcement in fundamentally new ways.The decision by the F.C.C. to roll back net neutrality rules was less surprising, but has equally far-reaching implications. With less regulation, big internet providers will be able to charge more for their services, extract new fees from websites and block content.\u201cThe F.C.C. is saying that they\u2019re going to give up any legal authority over regulating high-speed internet,\u201d said Susan Crawford, a professor at Harvard Law School. \u201cThey\u2019re handing the power to choose winners and losers online to about five companies.\u201dDespite the seeming irreconcilability of the moves by the Justice Department and the F.C.C., some see a common narrative in the two decisions.\u201cThey\u2019re both defense strategies against Silicon Valley,\u201d Mr. Wu said.By rolling back net neutrality, the government is giving old-school media companies like AT&T and Comcast more leverage over companies like Netflix, Google and Facebook that are increasingly becoming their competitors. And by challenging the AT&T merger with Time Warner, the Justice Department could be laying the groundwork for a new approach to antitrust enforcement that could be used to go after big technology firms.Barry Diller, the media mogul and chairman of IAC, which owns a host of websites including Match.com and Vimeo, cited the power of tech companies in expressing exasperation at the Justice Department suit.\u201cIf you think AT&T has too much market power because of distribution, tell me what happens if you are Facebook and Google, which have unbelievable concentration in distribution,\u201d Mr. Diller said. \u201cHow would you ever be able to get a content addition to Google?\u201dAnd there is another school of thought suggesting that more vigorous antitrust enforcement might have obviated the need for net neutrality rules in the first place.If regulators had been stricter about ensuring robust competition among internet service providers over the years, the theory goes, big firms like AT&T would not be able to operate in ways that harm competition.\u201cNet neutrality was a distant-second-best remedy,\u201d Mr. Sagers said. \u201cIf we could have competition in internet service provision, that would have been way better than relying on the F.C.C.\u201dEven if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking AT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner, the opportunity to use antitrust enforcement as a means to give consumers more choice among internet providers has likely passed. And now, by unwinding net neutrality rules, Mr. Sagers said, the Trump administration will make it easier for big companies like AT&T to maintain the already enormous power it has amassed through earlier consolidation.\u201cIf you want to have a monopoly,\u201d he said, \u201cthe government can be your best friend.\u201dJohn Koblin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Barbra Streisand\u2019s Misty, Water-Colored Memories in a Netflix Concert Film", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingA few brief testimonials from her music director and her longtime manager later, the show begins. Directed by Ms. Streisand and the veteran music filmmaker Jim Gable, it is a relatively straightforward chronicle and, if you\u2019re watching closely enough, a bracing lesson in how far the concert movie has progressed since Martin Scorsese raised the bar for the genre with \u201cThe Last Waltz,\u201d his 1978 documentary about the Band, and Jonathan Demme raised it higher still with \u201cStop Making Sense,\u201d his 1984 Talking Heads film.The theme of Ms. Streisand\u2019s show, filmed last December in Miami, is summed up in its title. It\u2019s a bit of a nostalgia fest. Ms. Streisand has long struggled with stage fright, but you\u2019d never know it from the easy, relaxed way she interacts with her adoring audience before belting out her opening number, \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d (Whether she still deals with stage fright or not, Ms. Streisand appears very confident in her self-presentation backstage; in the preshow section, she sits before a mirror and tells the camera how she has always done her own makeup, reminiscing about convincing the makeup artist on her debut film, \u201cFunny Girl,\u201d that Ms. Streisand really did know best.)A mezzo-soprano of what you might call wide-screen expressiveness, Ms. Streisand has a little more grit and grain in her voice than she used to, but like the master that she is, she makes it work for her. And when she brings her songs to their big moments \u2014 she does excel at those that are meant to be acted as well as sung, like Stephen Sondheim\u2019s \u201cBeing Alive\u201d \u2014 the movie delivers a montage assembled from the views of multiple cameras, one swooping in on Ms. Streisand, another pulling back, another fixed in close-up, another taking in the band, finally settling on a shot of an understandably ecstatic audience.The show itself is both intimate and grand. Ms. Streisand sits herself at a little table with a teapot and cup atop it and tells some stories before or after a song. \u201cTo give you an idea of how long ago that was,\u201d she says after one anecdote, \u201cit was when a tweet was what a bird did, and the only people who had cell numbers were in jail.\u201d That\u2019s typical of her patter. She\u2019ll also sit near a piano. But when she\u2019s going for big effects, her tech department delivers: It simulates a lightning storm during \u201cPapa, Can You Hear Me?\u201d a song from the 1983 film \u201cYentl.\u201dA lot of the memories she addresses in the show are movie related. Ms. Streisand was a defining leading lady in \u201960s, \u201970s and even \u201980s films, stretching across various genres. At the show she speaks with genuine reverence for William Wyler, who directed \u201cFunny Girl\u201d (1968), adapted from the 1964 Broadway show that made her a star. She remembers his openness to her ideas. She also pays brief tribute to Harry Stradling Sr., the cinematographer for \u201cFunny Girl\u201d and three subsequent pictures she starred in. A video montage of stills shows Ms. Streisand consulting with the directors Peter Bogdanovich in \u201cWhat\u2019s Up, Doc?,\u201d Irvin Kershner in \u201cUp the Sandbox,\u201d and Sydney Pollack in \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201dThose collaborations were part of her road to taking up directing, which she first did with \u201cYentl.\u201d She had become a producer well before that, with the 1976 film \u201cA Star Is Born.\u201d During her chat with the audience, she brings up a 1987 movie, \u201cNuts,\u201d a drama she also produced (she plays a prostitute on trial for killing a john). \u201cInteresting picture, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she says to the audience.It\u2019s in one respect the sign of a true star that every picture he or she is in, good or bad, is always interesting. That\u2019s the case with Ms. Streisand. But one side effect of watching \u201cBarbra: The Music \u2026 the Mem\u2019ries \u2026 the Magic!\u201d was to make me want to catch up on some of her films.

{"Headline": "Tim Wu: Why the Courts Will Have to Save Net Neutrality", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBack in 2005, a small phone company based in North Carolina named Madison River began preventing its subscribers from making phone calls using the internet application Vonage. As Vonage was a competitor in the phone call market, Madison River\u2019s action was obviously anticompetitive. Consumers complained, and the Federal Communications Commission, under Michael Powell, its Republican-appointed chairman, promptly fined the company and forced it to stop blocking Vonage.That was the moment when \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules went from a mere academic proposal to a part of the United States legal order. On that foundation \u2014 an open internet, with no blocking \u2014 much of our current internet ecosystem was built.Allowing such censorship is anathema to the internet\u2019s (and America\u2019s) founding spirit. And by going this far, the F.C.C. may also have overplayed its legal hand. So drastic is the reversal of policy (if, as expected, the commission approves Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal next month), and so weak is the evidence to support the change, that it seems destined to be struck down in court.The problem for Mr. Pai is that government agencies are not free to abruptly reverse longstanding rules on which many have relied without a good reason, such as a change in factual circumstances. A mere change in F.C.C. ideology isn\u2019t enough. As the Supreme Court has said, a federal agency must \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.\u201d Given that net neutrality rules have been a huge success by most measures, the justification for killing them would have to be very strong.It isn\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s very weak. From what we know so far, Mr. Pai\u2019s rationale for eliminating the rules is that cable and phone companies, despite years of healthy profit, need to earn even more money than they already do \u2014 that is, that the current rates of return do not yield adequate investment incentives. More specifically, Mr. Pai claims that industry investments have gone down since 2015, the year the Obama administration last strengthened the net neutrality rules.But Mr. Pai faces a more serious legal problem. Because he is killing net neutrality outright, not merely weakening it, he will have to explain to a court not just the shift from 2015 but also his reasoning for destroying the basic bans on blocking and throttling, which have been in effect since 2005 and have been relied on extensively by the entire internet ecosystem.This will be a difficult task. What has changed since 2004 that now makes the blocking or throttling of competitors not a problem? The evidence points strongly in the opposite direction: There is a long history of anticompetitive throttling and blocking \u2014 often concealed \u2014 that the F.C.C. has had to stop to preserve the health of the internet economy. Examples include AT&T\u2019s efforts to keep Skype off iPhones and the blocking of Google Wallet by Verizon. Services like Skype and Netflix would have met an early death without basic net neutrality protections. Mr. Pai needs to explain why we no longer have to worry about this sort of threat \u2014 and \u201cYou can trust your cable company\u201d will not suffice.Moreover, the F.C.C. is acting contrary to public sentiment, which may embolden the judiciary to oppose Mr. Pai. Telecommunications policy does not always attract public attention, but net neutrality does, and polls indicate that 76 percent of Americans support it. The F.C.C., in short, is on the wrong side of the democratic majority.In our times, the judiciary has increasingly become a majoritarian force. It alone, it seems, can prevent narrow, self-interested factions from getting the government to serve unseemly and even shameful ends. And so it falls to the judiciary to stop this latest travesty.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

But TV Comedies Took It On.", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe second season of \u201cMaster of None\u201d hit Netflix in May, but it feels more relevant every day. In the finale, Dev Shah \u2014 the struggling actor played by the show\u2019s co-creator and star Aziz Ansari \u2014 is celebrating. He just scored a role in a food travel show, \u201cBest Food Friends,\u201d as sidekick to Chef Jeff, the swaggering Food TV star played by Bobby Cannavale. Then Dev meets up with an old colleague, Benjamin (H. Jon Benjamin), who reluctantly punctures Dev\u2019s excitement. \u201cI\u2019ve heard through the grapevine that Chef Jeff is a little bit of a creep,\u201d Benjamin tells him, relaying a story he heard thirdhand about Jeff harassing a food stylist on set.Dev is taken aback. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019ve got to work with this guy!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, man, that\u2019s a tough problem,\u201d Benjamin replies. \u201cI\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to deal with it.\u201dSexual harassment in the entertainment industry has often been described as an open secret. Before the current wave of accusations and apologies and denials and therapy commitments hit, tales of harassment were aired through celebrity gossip sites and warned about in whisper networks. They were also exorcised through television plotlines. In the past year, even as some of the industry\u2019s biggest abusers still lurked in the shadows, shows like \u201cMaster of None,\u201d \u201cGirls\u201d and \u201cOne Mississippi\u201d all grappled with the role of the bystander \u2014 the person who knows something, but isn\u2019t sure quite what to do about it.But the bystander\u2019s responsibility is more ambivalent than the headlines suggest. We\u2019ve now been inundated with images of victims bravely coming forward and abusers cowering behind legalese, but the role of the bystander still lacks a clear social script. We\u2019ve yet to hash out a consensus on when third parties have a moral obligation to speak on behalf of a victim, confront a friend, or relay rumors to higher ups. Perhaps that\u2019s why the bystander\u2019s predicament has lent itself so handily to comedy, particularly the kind of dark prestige dramedies that make moral and sexual ambiguity their playgrounds.Dev is always trying to be the good guy, then bumbling into situations where supporting women ends up unexpectedly deflating his own male privilege. In the first season, Dev is cast in a hardware store ad, and at a bar after shooting one day, he drunkenly opines to the director that the ad feels sexist because it exclusively stars men. When Dev reports to set the next day, he finds that his role has been recast with a woman, a new \u201cdirection\u201d inspired by Dev\u2019s woke observations. A miffed Dev asks: \u201cIs there another direction where I don\u2019t get fired and lose a bunch of money?\u201dIn Season 2, Dev seeks out one of Jeff\u2019s targets \u2014 a former makeup artist on his show \u2014 and suggests that she report the harassment to network higher-ups. When she declines, he respects her decision not to speak up. Then she writes a blog post that sets off a public reckoning, and \u201cChef Jeff Is a Perv\u201d starts trending on Twitter. Even then, Dev can\u2019t bring himself to confront the oblivious Jeff. Instead they step onto a live talk show set to make paella and promote \u201cBest Food Friends.\u201d When the news breaks on live TV, a chyron pops under Dev\u2019s image that reads: \u201cDEV SHAH: Sexual predator Chef Jeff\u2019s \u2018BFF.\u2019\u201d As Chef Jeff storms offset, Dev lies: \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about this!\u201d\u201cMaster of None\u201d reveals how it\u2019s often easier to support a woman in the abstract than it is to actually condemn a man, especially if that guy is your blustering celebrity boss. It\u2019s not just female underlings who are socialized to be nice and agreeable to guys like that, and when placed under their power, it\u2019s often more instinctual to freeze than fight. When you lend an ear to a victim who\u2019s not ready to go public, it\u2019s hard to know how to keep her secret without also protecting her harasser \u2014 and making your own reputation vulnerable when the truth comes out.In February, HBO\u2019s \u201cGirls\u201d aired its own harassment episode, one focused on the confusing experience of getting to know \u2014 and like \u2014 an alleged predator. In \u201cAmerican Bitch,\u201d the fictional novelist Chuck Palmer (Matthew Rhys) invites Hannah Horvath (Ms. Dunham) to his fancy uptown apartment to confront her about an article she wrote about him in a \u201cniche feminist blog.\u201d Hannah has collected a handful of online accusations from young female fans whom Chuck has lured into questionably consensual sexual encounters by leveraging his fame.That episode collapses an entire relationship into an afternoon: Though Hannah is standoffish at first, Chuck draws her into an intimate exchange in which he challenges her journalism, flatters her intelligence, scrounges for sympathy, plies her with gifts, and then \u2014 oops \u2014 pulls out his penis. The episode ends with Chuck\u2019s preteen daughter coming home, and Chuck using her presence to forestall any further discussion about what\u2019s just happened.Hannah and Chuck\u2019s encounter dances around some unspoken dynamics of harassment. The power game can be as mental as it is physical. Often men who hurt women help women in other ways, and that can be self-serving too \u2014 supporting women\u2019s work might open up new opportunities to take advantage of them, woo them with flattery that ends up entrapping them in a kind of complicity, or help shield the men\u2019s reputations against unseemly accusations. Mostly, the episode questions whether knowing a man personally can help clarify the strength of allegations against him. In fact, it seems to obscure the question: The more Chuck becomes known to Hannah, the more the women who accused him become abstracted. Hannah\u2019s not thinking about them when she\u2019s laughing and talking with him, and neither are we.But what\u2019s good for one woman isn\u2019t necessarily good for women in general. Doing good doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve never done anything bad. And as Ms. Dunham so smartly explored in \u201cGirls,\u201d knowing someone isn\u2019t the same as knowing what they\u2019ve done; abusers can conceal their crimes even from their closest friends. Ms. Dunham has since apologized for putting a \u201cthumb on the scale\u201d in the unresolved case. But her example shows that even the most carefully aligned politics can be overwhelmed by the pull of personal and professional relationships \u2014 especially in Hollywood, where every connection is fortified with influence and wealth.\u201cOne Mississippi\u201d stars Ms. Notaro as a radio personality with a complicated relationship to her Mississippi hometown. When a producer at her network masturbates in front of a co-worker and friend, Kate (played by her real-life spouse, Stephanie Allynne) Tig goes on a rampage on her behalf. She storms into the masturbator\u2019s office (he denies it), then brings Kate to tell their boss. He finds the account hard to believe, he says, because the masturbator is \u201cso progressive!\u201d Finally, Tig is on the verge of outing the masturbator live on her radio show when Kate reminds her that she doesn\u2019t have the license to publicly air Kate\u2019s experience. So Tig takes to the airwaves to tell her own story, of being molested by her step-grandfather as a child.There\u2019s something inviting about taking on sexual harassment in a 30-minute comedic sprint, either as a bottle episode (like the one in \u201cGirls\u201d) or a finale plot twist (as in \u201cMaster of None\u201d). If the victim and accuser are minor enough characters, and the behavior less horrendous than rape it allows the creator to nod to the problem without having to deal with its ramifications all season long.Also this year, harassment showed up as a role-reversal gag in an episode of NBC\u2019s \u201cGreat News,\u201d in which a female TV exec (played by Tina Fey) starts performatively harassing her employees in a bid to land a big payout like the ones afforded Roger Ailes and Bill O\u2019Reilly. The only problem is that her co-workers are too cowardly and confused to actually report her. The exasperated executive confesses to her foiled plan and rebukes them for not taking a stand (and getting her a payday). Another Tina Fey show, \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d dispenses of its own harassment plotline in a scene: Titus (Tituss Burgess) auditions for his dream job on \u201cSesame Street\u201d only to get an uncomfortable quid-pro-quo request from Mr. Frumpus, the (fictional) old man neighbor puppet. Titus scampers out of the audition. Bit over.It seems unlikely that these more fleeting television moments would be scripted exactly this way today. When the details about big-name industry abusers were still in the shadows of the popular consciousness, it allowed for some comedic freedom. Sexual harassment could safely be raised as a serious-but-not-too-serious offense, one that might allow for some nuance in the telling. But now that the grave details of abuse lodged against people like Harvey Weinstein have been made clear, they feel too weighty to play around with, at least for now. \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d the rare show to commit to its harassment story line, feels like the series best equipped to respond to this moment. In fact, the show has already doubled down, using the masturbation incident to explore the wider scope of sexual violence against women and girls. It\u2019s earned the license to keep telling the story.Advertisement"}

IFC did not comment on that.The effort could lead to criticism that Mr. Avrich is trying to capitalize on Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior. \u201cAnybody who says that doesn\u2019t know me or my work,\u201d Mr. Avrich said.Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Weinstein has repeatedly denied \u201cany allegations of nonconsensual sex.\u201d\u201cI set out to make a film that looked at Harvey as a businessman and cultural force, someone who was a creative genius but also an incredible bully,\u201d Mr. Avrich said on Wednesday. \u201cI briefly looked into his reputation with women, but nobody would touch it.\u201dHe added: \u201cI was never told about him as a sexual predator. Would I have gone there if I had known? Absolutely. I obviously wish I had pushed harder. It would have made for a far better film.\u201dMr. Avrich said he had tried to get Gwyneth Paltrow, Quentin Tarantino and others associated with Mr. Weinstein to participate in the film but had been rebuffed.An earlier version of this article misstated the Weinstein Company\u2019s connection to a film that Barry Avrich is making about the Nuremberg prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz. It previously controlled the rights to the film. It does not control them now.Advertisement"}

Here are a few pointers from Iliza Shlesinger, the author of the new book \u201cGirl Logic.\u201d\u201cA very long time ago I accepted that travel is just a necessary evil, and unlike many things in my life, I decided going with the flow would make it less painful,\u201d Ms. Shlesinger said. The problem, she added, is that not every traveler is as sensible. \u201cThere should be an F.A.A. fine for those who bring hot food that emits odor onto the plane,\u201d Ms. Shlesinger said. \u201cYou\u2019re deemed selfish and you have to take some sort of social awareness class.\u201d Always be nice to the front desk staff because they can choose to make your life a living hell, and they\u2019ll remember you. You\u2019re going to run into all types, but the best idea is to always give them a second chance and be nice, because I found that those are typically the people who will say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to charge you for the internet. Thanks for coming.\u201d I bought some at O\u2019Hare during a layover. They\u2019re great because if there\u2019s a weird squeaking noise outside your hotel room, or there\u2019s a dripping sound and there\u2019s nobody at the hotel who can fix it right away, sometimes you need the ability to just tune it out. And get the noise-canceling earbuds, not headphones, because you can\u2019t sleep on a headphone. There should be a special place, not only in hell, but in an off-site waiting area where if you get to security and you ask a question like, \u201cCan I bring this bottle of water\u201d or \u201cDo I have to take off my shoes,\u201d you automatically get sent to this special waiting room. And, you know what? You don\u2019t get to take the flight. We can\u2019t have you on a flight, because if you\u2019re someone that asks those kinds of questions, who knows what you\u2019re going to do on a plane? You\u2019re probably going to do something like bring a hot hamburger and stink up the entire aircraft. You never feel great after drinking. They try to make it like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re on Virgin Airlines. It\u2019s a big sex party.\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cNo, I need to brush my teeth and eat this Jidori Chicken dinner before we cross some sort of prime meridian so I get some normal sleep.\u201d But if you take a Virgin Airlines flight first class, it\u2019s almost like flying private. They really shoulder the responsibilities of your mental anxiety. Otherwise, they start with, \u201cThis is a full flight, so we\u2019re going to need you to remove your arm. We hate you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Sense of the U.S. Case Against AT&T-Time Warner", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAT&T and Time Warner are trying to merge into a nationwide internet, satellite television and media powerhouse.Here is what you need to know to make sense of the government\u2019s case:Why was the government\u2019s decision such a surprise?AT&T and Time Warner do not directly compete against each other. So their combination, known in the business world as a vertical merger, would not reduce the number of companies in the telecommunications or media markets. That is a key test of competition for antitrust officials.For about four decades mergers like this one passed regulatory muster, notably Comcast\u2019s union with NBC in 2011 and Time Warner\u2019s merger with AOL in 2000. The Justice Department has been more critical of mergers between companies that directly compete, what antitrust officials call horizontal mergers. In 2015, the agency blocked another Comcast deal, that time to buy Time Warner Cable, a cable company that is a separate company from Time Warner. The agency said that combining the two cable and broadband providers would reduce options for consumers and have too much power.Then why are antitrust officials doing this? Makan Delrahim, less than two months into his job as the head of the antitrust division at the Justice Department, has arrived with a very different approach to merger reviews.He has said that he is not opposed to vertical mergers in general. But he said he disagreed with how anticompetitive concerns for these deals have been handled in the past.Traditionally, antitrust officials have addressed concerns by making companies agree to abstain from anticompetitive practices. In the case of the Comcast-NBC Universal deal, Comcast promised to share NBC programming with streaming companies like Netflix, for example. These sort of arrangements are called behavioral remedies.But Mr. Delrahim believes that those agreements are difficult to police and often do not work. If there are anticompetitive harms, he says, the companies should be willing to sell off assets to allay those concerns.Why does Mr. Delrahim criticize behavioral remedies?Mr. Delrahim, a Republican who served at the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration, believes the government should not expend a lot of resources on merger enforcement. He thinks consent decrees with behavioral conditions turn the Justice Department into a regulatory agency that has to police those settlements for years.In a speech at the American Bar Association this month, Mr. Delrahim said, \u201cLike any regulatory scheme, behavioral remedies require centralized decisions instead of a free market process.\u201d He added that if a deal is anticompetitive, \u201cwe should only accept a clean and complete solution.\u201dAre regulators rethinking antitrust more broadly?Corporate consolidation, particularly in the tech and media sectors, has become a bipartisan concern. Lawmakers say they are worried about the power of Facebook over public opinion and Amazon\u2019s great reach across retail, media, and business services like cloud storage.There is a call for regulators to think more creatively about antitrust. A common test for antitrust officials is whether customers will be harmed. Many tech companies easily pass that test because they offer handy, free or inexpensive products. But critics of existing laws say that the big companies may be hurting competition in other ways, by preventing start-ups from succeeding or innovating, that are more difficult to measure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rev-Up: Imagining a 20% Self-Driving World", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "Call it 20 percent: the day, if it ever arrives, that one out of five vehicles you encounter will be driving itself. In some ways, the 20 percent era is harder to imagine than the fully automated era, because this supposedly unstoppable and frictionless technology will still be embroiled in a total mess. The best, safest models will most likely come with the highest price tags, out of reach for those with average incomes. Coexistence between human and robot drivers will be uneasy at best; road rage against the machine will boil over. One catastrophic accident could still imperil the whole experiment, no matter what the overall statistics show.But that inevitable mess is precisely what makes the one-in-five future so interesting to ponder. It\u2019s the first point, give or take, when it will be clear that a true self-driving future is even possible. When car companies will actually be able to rip out the steering wheels from some models, designing them in entirely different ways. When big trucking firms and car services like Uber will have begun to remove drivers from their vehicles. When hypercommuters will trust their cars to drive them three hours to the office while they sleep. When you might risk putting your child in one, alone.The autonomous vehicle went from test-track prototype to showroom reality far faster than I envisioned, propelled as much by advances in sensors and A.I. as by a collective hype cycle that seemed intent on willing these devices into existence, whether society was ready for them or not. Sitting with that \u201cbeginner\u201d driver in 2008, as engineers closely observed its movements, took me back to that life-defining moment of getting a driver\u2019s license. In my wallet, sparse with a library card and a school-lunch ticket, the license had real heft. It represented a primordial entry point to adulthood, a vast expansion of social possibility.As a rite, the driver\u2019s exam \u2014 I have failed it in two countries \u2014 is a ritual by turns (three-point, of course!) tedious and terrifying. If you can summon nothing else of the 1988 teen comedy \u201cLicense to Drive,\u201d you can still see James Avery\u2019s gleefully malevolent D.M.V. examiner, wielding his famous coffee cup. Once autonomous technology begins to really take off, will the driver\u2019s license, and the pedagogy behind it, go the way of the stick shift? Will the ability to drive begin to seem some exotic, rarely necessary skill \u2014 like starting a fire with a flint?After all, in a vehicle that meets the Level 5 automation criteria of SAE International \u2014 \u201cfull-time performance by an Automated Driving System for all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions\u201d \u2014 there would seem to be little point in possessing this vestigial skill. We don\u2019t require people entering elevators, riding in airport trams or letting Roombas loose upon their living rooms to be able to take over operation in case of machine failure; it\u2019s hard to see why our interaction with this automated technology should be any different. Our learning process could be as quick and dirty as it is with other high-tech products: Toss out the instruction manual and watch someone do it on YouTube.But this possibility, driver made passenger, broaches new territory in jurisprudence. With no licenses, what is the legal basis for restricting anyone \u2014 tweens, the elderly \u2014 from being ferried about? Young farm kids\u2019 driving the family truck seems as obsolete as tail fins, but what\u2019s stopping kids from being driven? Could children, often more adept at handling the smartphones of their parents than their owners are, have an advantage on older drivers less accustomed to technology? Yet the same fears that keep parents from letting their children walk to school may prevail over the allure of their autonomous vehicle handling the school run. It seems hard to say whether autonomous vehicles would hasten or delay the passage to adulthood.And as drivers interact with semiautonomous vehicles in the long run-up to Level 5, driver education and licensing, far from becoming obsolete, may become more important, argues John D. Lee, a professor of engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cAutomation has a strong tendency to surprise people with unexpected behavior,\u201d he says. Knowing what your car is doing \u2014 and when to take over \u2014 could be more vital than merely knowing how to drive. That water on the road \u2014 is it a surface puddle, or a veritable lake filling a gigantic pothole? That truck ahead with the dangerously swaying load \u2014 do you speed up to pass it? Is the pedestrian by the marked crosswalk waiting for you to yield or simply checking his iPhone? \u201cDriving and managing the automation that is helping you drive,\u201d Lee says, \u201care two quite different skill sets. Automation-management skills need to be learned as much as driving skills.\u201dTom Vanderbilt is the author of \u201cYou May Also Like\u201d and \u201cTraffic.\u201dDriverless cars will sometimes need to move around the city with no humans in them at all \u2014 en route to pickups or drop-offs. As empty moving vehicles become a common sight, they\u2019re sure to enable an annoying off-label use: a flowering youth subculture of external joy riding, similar to subway surfing.All over the country, bored teenagers will lurk on the roadside, waiting to leap onto the roofs of empty cars, hanging on for as long as they can. The surfers will take advantage of advances in cloaking technology to help them confuse the cars\u2019 sensors. Some will develop a clever assortment of grips and attachments to help them stay on, although the best among them will sneer at those who need to use tools. Fatalities will be inevitable, and often gruesome.To keep the kids off, car owners will try to coat their cars in slick repellents; these will be effective but too messy to be practical. Soon, dealers of autonomous cars will offer optional rows of spikes similar to those we already use to keep homeless people off benches. Once again, design will become more hostile in the name of safety.Rollo Romig is a journalist based in New York.Liberated from having to watch the road, commuters\u2019 eyes will be free to \u2014 what else? \u2014 consume video content. Sound\u2019s hold on drive time \u2014 first with terrestrial radio, then satellite radio, then podcasts \u2014 will gave way to sight. But what kind of videos will we watch? If Marchetti\u2019s constant holds (this is the idea that as transportation technology and urban planning change, people contort their lives to keep their commutes to an average of one hour per day), they will be not feature films but TV shows and short videos of the kind being increasingly produced for Facebook and YouTube. Podcasts will be displaced by vodcasts. Media companies are already negotiating with carmakers about how to price their offerings. Should in-car entertainment work more like cable or like the on-demand system in a hotel? Like Netflix or like Roku?Most riders who play games will use their phones. But by the time one in five cars is autonomous, console makers will develop specific products for it. The nearly two hours a day of console gaming played by some 60 million Americans will tick up accordingly. Swarms of commuters hitting the morning and evening roads in waves will become swarms of druids or mercenaries in massively multiplayer online games, some of which might come to incorporate the driving experience itself, a Pok\u00e9mon Go for the highway.It seems less likely that we\u2019ll use this opportunity to steal time back from screens. But if there\u2019s enough space for a table, maybe commuters will sit around it playing poker or telling stories. Cars are, indeed, the most private places we have, sealed shut, out of earshot. (The writer Nicholson Baker has said that he likes to write while in a car parked in a shady spot.)Chris Anderson \u2014 formerly the editor of Wired, now the head of a drone-data company and, in his spare time, of a racing league for autonomous cars \u2014 says the question of what we\u2019ll do inside self-driving cars always comes up at cocktail parties. It always confounds him. \u201cWe have this world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s called the back seat of an Uber.\u201d We already know what passengers do in back seats, be they in a limo or an R.V. or a tour bus: They pull out their phones or their iPads, or they talk to one another, or they take a nap. Why should we think that not having a driver will change anything?In an essay for Real Life magazine titled \u201cPerpetual Motion Machines,\u201d Chenoe Hart argues that we miss something when we think of autonomous cars this way, as a difference in degree, not in kind. Because we won\u2019t have to worry about driving, vehicle interiors can expand to a point where we\u2019 stop thinking of them as vehicles: They might have fully functional kitchens, or gyms, or beds. Instead of going to the coffee shop, the coffee shop might come to you; instead of going into the garage to pull out your car, the garage will be the car. The ability to summon spaces like this, Hart writes, will turn the built environment into a kind of random-access memory \u2014 with every destination equally accessible from anywhere. Whether it drove to you or you to it will be irrelevant; motion will be so smooth and constant as to be imperceptible. Hart argues that when travel becomes fully autonomous, we will always be traveling: families or co-workers in quiet concert on giant roads, moving in a cluster of moving buildings, chasing good weather, hardly aware that we\u2019re going anywhere at all.James Somers is a writer and programmer based in New York.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.It\u2019s not as straightforward as it sounds. For one thing, the vehicles would not be freed from the laws of physics. Should your car abruptly brake while you were, for example, running on a treadmill, the treadmill would cease moving forward \u2014 but you wouldn\u2019t, at least until you hit a windshield or door.It might be easier to remain seated. \u201cThe car could have special pockets all over the place that hold resistance bands of different strengths,\u201d says Bryant Johnson, a personal trainer and the author of \u201cThe Ruth Bader Ginsburg Workout.\u201d \u201cYou could use those to get a full-body strength-training workout.\u201dThroughout your commute, your future car could scrutinize your efforts, says Steve McCauley, the head of health services for the Wynn Las Vegas resort, with fingertip monitors or other sensors tracking your heart rate and the composition of your sweat.But realistically, many of us will use our salvaged commuting time otherwise. In tomorrow\u2019s cars, the area beneath the hood may not be needed for a combustion engine, Vujicic says \u2014 but it will remain, for reasons of mechanical stability and safety. Fitted with some padding and a safety belt, it becomes a napping cave.If self-driving cars start to make up a significant portion of urban traffic, they\u2019re likely to push cities to become more populous and compact, with fewer owned vehicles and more car sharing. The future, that is, would look more like Singapore, one of the world\u2019s densest cities, whose government in recent years has tried to curb car ownership and ease congestion problems. We reached out to Limin Hee, the director of research at Singapore\u2019s Center for Livable Cities, to ask her about how she thinks autonomous cars will begin to change urban life.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.These exploits, though dramatic, took advantage of the same vulnerabilities in cellular networks that might plague any tablet or smart vacuum cleaner. But a future in which one in five vehicles is autonomous will not only increase the attack \u201csurface\u201d (in the metaphor favored by researchers) of the car; it will also force manufacturers to confront more insidious security risks that are only now coming into view. It will become possible to compromise vehicles by hacking the environment.A car that drives itself uses sensors to construct high-resolution images of its surroundings, then runs them through a \u201cclassifier\u201d to identify all the objects in the image. The classifier can do this because it has trained on labeled images; after seeing a hundred thousand trucks, it learns to recognize certain features as indicating truck-ness. Today\u2019s most popular and effective classifiers for object recognition, used widely in self-driving car software, are called deep neural networks.But a deep neural network offers researchers very little understanding of why objects become classified as they do. Think of its output as a map, with each classification corresponding, like a ZIP code, to some demarcated region. Instead of existing in just two dimensions, though, the map has more like a thousand dimensions \u2014 and the slightest move in any one of these dimensions can push us into a different ZIP code and produce a false classification. This makes it possible for a hacker to construct slightly perturbed images, called \u201cadversarial examples,\u201d that look innocuous to the human eye but fool the car\u2019s brain into making the wrong call, with potentially fatal consequences.Adversarial examples are extremely difficult to defend against. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand these attacks,\u201d says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut the deeper question is that we don\u2019t understand deep neural networks.\u201d In a recent paper, Song and her co-authors introduced a method of constructing robust adversarial examples that can even be printed on paper and pasted to road signs. A stop sign defaced with specially calibrated graffiti, for instance, is recognized as a 45 m.p.h. speed-limit sign.Song\u2019s warning extends beyond road infrastructure. While researchers for decades have been working on \u2014 and developing countermeasures for \u2014 software vulnerabilities, the study of security issues related to deep learning is still in its infancy. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a precise mathematical definition of a pedestrian,\u201d Song says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for us to write down a formula describing exactly what a pedestrian is. So we can\u2019t even really define our security goals.\u201d Even with a recent surge of interest in adversarial examples, researchers are still struggling to understand the scope of the problem. Given the physical-world ramifications, Song says, \u201cwe should have started even sooner.\u201dYiren Lu is a writer and software engineer in New York.The trickiest part of the transition to a self-driving future may be figuring out liability when accidents do happen. Instead of quarreling only about which driver was at fault, we will also be able to argue about whether the self-driving features in either car may have played a role. A preview of these complications was evident in the aftermath of the crash that killed Joshua Brown, the Ohio man whose autopiloted Tesla ran into a tractor-trailer. Federal investigators determined that the accident was not caused by a defect in the autopilot software, and Tesla has said repeatedly that drivers should always have their hands on the wheel even when they are using the technology. But officials noted that Tesla\u2019s technology was unable to detect cross-traffic like that presented by the tractor-trailer. Tesla subsequently updated its software to make similar accidents less likely in the future.So who was responsible for covering the damages? The insurance policy that covered Brown, who may not have fully understood the capabilities of his car, or Tesla? Neither Tesla nor Brown\u2019s family has commented on who paid. And both car insurers and insurance regulators have been relatively slow to contend with the difficulty in assigning liability when a person is driving a car only part of the time. \u201cInsurance policies have not necessarily caught up with the global advancement of A.I. technology in cars,\u201d Brown\u2019s lawyer told me.Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley, which is racing to raise the curtain on the era of autonomous vehicles, is also thinking about insurance. A start-up called Driav intends to bring down insurance rates by monitoring the reams of data coming out of self-driving cars in order to figure out, on a second-to-second basis, who or what caused the errors that led to a crash. \u201cIt\u2019s silly that claims are a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 argument,\u201d Dan Peate, Driav\u2019s chief executive, told me. \u201cThe data can just tell us what happened.\u201d The company hopes to begin offering insurance policies next year, with the expectation that they will be cheaper in part because the cars will be in fewer accidents and in part because it plans to be able to shift some liability onto the carmakers.In the long run, when all vehicles are driving themselves, the manufacturers themselves are very likely to assume all of the blame for accidents. Most such companies have said that they plan to pay for anything that happens while their cars and software are in charge. When that\u2019s the case, insurance begins to look a lot more like a product warranty, covered by the carmaker, than a stand-alone product that a customer has to worry about. But in the transition years until then, there are likely to be a lot more messy arguments.Nathaniel Popper is a technology reporter for The Times.When I think about the future these days, I inevitably return to a tweet from the writer Elizabeth Hamilton-Argyropoulos (a.k.a. @bourgeoisalien): \u201cThe saddest part about self-driving cars will be all the times people die mid-trip and then ur dinner guests or pizza guy will arrive dead.\u201d To read this joke is to become immediately certain that this will absolutely happen \u2014 of course it will! \u2014 and that it will furthermore become as much a part of the texture of everyday future life as, say, traffic delays caused by collisions are now. Admittedly, the dead-pizza-guy notion doesn\u2019t seem very likely: A large part of the impetus behind the development of self-driving technology in the first place is the desire to do away with the need for flesh-and-blood people who demand wages for their work. But the image feels symbolically resonant precisely because of the ghostly future of all those moribund jobs. Self-driving cars bearing the earthly remains of the recently deceased \u2014 automated Ubers, say, with heart-attack victims sprawled incredulously across the rear seat \u2014 are, in this sense, an extreme metaphor for the near future of capitalism. The technology will be miraculous, yes; but if it functions as intended, it will serve as an uncanny vector of human obsolescence.Mark O\u2019Connell is a writer based in Dublin.\u201cRide-sharing\u201d was always a misnomer for companies like Uber and Lyft. As with the rest of the \u201csharing economy,\u201d nothing was ever being shared; labor and services were being bought and sold. But as ride-share companies have grown, their ambitions have multiplied and compounded. Currently, their horizons are limited by widespread car ownership, alternative transit options and, primarily, their own cost. But autonomous cars make their grander plans \u2014 dreams of vast fleets of perfectly allocated and used vehicles \u2014 more plausible. They zero out a single variable, the cost of labor, that these companies believe is holding them back from utterly reshaping the world. Ride-share businesses are uniquely poised to manifest and demonstrate the big ideas of self-driving cars. They aren\u2019t waiting for this change; they\u2019re doing everything in their power to hasten it. Autonomous cars aren\u2019t just part of the plan; they are the plan.Conservative estimates put the world\u2019s Ubers and Lyfts in an enviable position as self-driving cars roll out. Bullish projections put them in an unassailable one. A 2017 report by Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest, told the story in four numbers. A rider\u2019s \u201call-in cost per mile\u201d for average United States taxi services was about $3.50. For a human-driven Uber in San Francisco, that number was about $2.86. Assuming the same fuel price, the figure for personal cars is much lower, at around 70 cents. The estimate for self-driving taxi services, circa 2020, would cut that cost in half.At 35 cents per mile, tasks that were previously too expensive or that would have felt ridiculous become reasonable and routine. A world in which moving yourself or moving things to you costs almost nothing in terms of money or attention would remake places and transform lives. It would also bring with it new and complicated absurdities \u2014 the sort Americans adapt to quickly and then forget. (Like bottles of water shipped around the world and sold for $2, or electronics products assembled in one country from parts from six others, to be shipped to a seventh.)Riders will thrill to this new infrastructure as it incorporates the roads around them, providing novel experiences and conveniences. But this excitement will prevent us from seeing that our aspiring fleet managers hope to create something like the profound consolidation of the internet\u2019s recent past. Just as Amazon the online store laid the groundwork for Amazon the comprehensive and omnipresent service, apps for human-driven taxis may have laid the groundwork for a thrumming on-demand grid, on which people and things can be placed and retrieved.Like Google and Facebook before them, which remapped, rerouted and dominated the old and diverse web infrastructure on which they were built, Uber and Lyft could say, credibly, that they work better with size and full participation. That market domination is merely the flip side of completeness. They will aspire to monopoly and could achieve, with startling speed, real and unprecedented claims over the roads we share \u2014 they will say they\u2019ve found a better use for them, and if all goes to plan, riders will agree.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The Times.Unless you\u2019re a millionaire or a truck driver, your first encounter with a self-driving vehicle will probably be a car you ordered through a ride-hailing app like Lyft or Uber. These companies, which spent the first stage of their lives trying to get drivers into their cars, are spending the next one trying to get them out. There will be some initial awkwardness around self-driving vehicles, just as there was around ride-hailing in the first place. (Remember when it was weird to get into a stranger\u2019s unmarked car?)But Lyft, for one, is betting that it can put a trustable face on the tech. In July, it announced Level 5, a lab where it will work on its own driverless software, in addition to developing an open self-driving network that companies like Ford and Jaguar Land Rover will be able to plug their vehicles into. The idea of the network is to combine multiple kinds of autonomous vehicles under one routing-and-request system, so that when you order a Lyft, the app will assess your route, check the weather and other factors and send you the best ride, whether that\u2019s an autonomous Waymo or a human-driven S.U.V. John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s co-founder and president, explained its thinking.Kevin Roose is a business columnist for The Times and a writer at large for the magazine.For reasons that have gone unstudied, humans become horny in transit. With the proliferation of subway systems came the proliferation of subway gropers. With commercial air travel came the \u201cMile High Club.\u201d Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee filmed their famous sex tape on a boat (I\u2019m told). There\u2019s something about transportation that gets people in the mood. What is it?My theory is simple. In our capacity as humans, we have three speeds at which we operate: crawl, walk and run. In other words: extremely slow, slow and slightly less slow. When we engage with equipment that increases our velocity, we become excited. This excitement applies in all cases, whether we\u2019re talking about an escalator, a moving walkway, a bicycle, a roller coaster, a golf cart or a Chrysler LeBaron. It is fundamentally thrilling to travel at an unexpected speed. When the enabling mode of transportation is one that permits our excitement to be processed as erotic energy \u2014 even if that processing is specifically legislated against \u2014 some of us will do that. The distance between \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cstimulated\u201d is, after all, incredibly short. If there were a way to have sex on a bicycle, people would be bike-sexing all the time. It would have its own verb.Having sex in a car is not currently impossible, but it is difficult. Hand-eye coordination, a mechanism critical for sex-having, is compromised for the driver, whose hands must remain on the wheel and eyes on the road. In road couplings, the driver is not an equal contributor. Unless, of course, the driver doesn\u2019t need to drive at all. Which brings us to the self-driving car: basically a motel room on wheels. The one hindrance to this development is existing public-lewdness laws, which are fairly expansive. You can\u2019t intentionally get naked and perform a \u201clewd act\u201d in a public place without risk of penalty. Obviously. But you also run a risk if you perform your lewd act in a private place with the intention of being watched \u2014 say, in a self-driven automobile slowly cruising past a school bus where my future grandchildren are watching in horror as a frenzied orgy unfolds within smelling distance. I am confident, however, that the law will be updated to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable car-based encounters.And if not, industrial designers can come up with clever \u201csolves,\u201d the word that start-ups use for some reason instead of \u201csolutions.\u201d If car windows no longer need to function as navigating aids, why not tint them to inky obscurity? Or replace them with mirrors facing outward? Or mirrors facing inward? Or remove them entirely? Future riders may not even need a human partner in order to have an intimate appointment. Nissan is working with Microsoft to develop an \u201cin-vehicle virtual personal assistant\u201d which, if deviously hacked, could provide the 21st-century equivalent of phone sex.More interesting than the aesthetics of car sex will be the cultural consequences. New slang terms will arise. New positions. New trophies. (How many times can you have sex in the time it takes to drive from Las Vegas to Los Angeles?) Virginities will be lost, children conceived, marriage vows consummated and violated. Car-based kinks will be minted and postcoital rituals established. New professional opportunities will emerge: interior decorators who specialize in \u201cself-driving bedrooms\u201d; entrepreneurs who launch apps to enable no-strings-attached in-car assignations. Preferences will be identified and explored. The world will expand in narrow but pulse-quickening ways \u2014 not a sexual revolution, but a plot twist.Molly Young is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

But the Justice Department may not let a big media marriage happen. That is one of the many debated questions. Proponents of the Republicans\u2019 plans argue that companies will invest the money. Opponents counter that firms will return the cash to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends.\u201cWhen all variables are measured properly, it seems major companies are paying out to shareholders about 22 percent of their net income. It\u2019s therefore unlikely that new profit, as might follow from lower corporate tax rates, will simply be drained out of the corporation.\u201cMore generally, sending money back to investors doesn\u2019t have to mean no new investment. What if those investors take the money and put it in a venture capital fund or invest it in some other manner? The whole point of capital markets is to recycle resources into the most profitable new opportunities, and that may or may not involve the companies that initially earned those profits.\u201dWith 95 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported third-quarter results, earnings are on pace to grow 6.2 percent from a year earlier, according to FactSet. That\u2019s up from the 3.1 percent growth rate expected at the end of period.Technology companies drove much of the growth. The sector reported a 19.7 percent increase in earnings and was the biggest contributor to earnings growth rate. If the tech sector was excluded, the overall growth rate would fall to 2.8 percent from 6.2 percent.Here are some more takeaways from earnings season:\u2022 Profits at companies that generate more that 50 percent of their sales outside the United States, grew more than 13 percent in the third quarter. Earnings at firms that get a majority of their revenue from within the U.S., rose only 2.3 percent.That is a reversal of what many analysts expected at the beginning of 2017. A stronger American dollar, a pickup in the United State\u2019s economy, and the Trump administration\u2019s policies were expected to benefit companies with the greatest exposure to United States were expected to benefit more from the Trump administration\u2019s policies, and a stronger dollar. But the United States dollar remained weaker.\u2022 The energy sector reported the largest increase in earnings of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors at 135 percent. The increase is a reflection of how hard the roughly two year slide in oil prices had hit the industry.\u2022 74 percent of companies have reported profits above analysts expectations, above the five-year average of 69 percent.\u2022 Financial firms reported the biggest decline in profits, down 8.3 percent. That decline can largely be blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Insurance companies in the sector reported 63 percent decrease in profits.\u2022 90 percent of the companies in the S&P 500\u2019s technology sector exceeded analyst estimates.\u2014 Stephen GrocerA traditional diesel truck can be operated for $1.51 a mile; the Tesla Semi, he said, beats that with $1.26.But it gets better.

The company kept its valuation relatively low, and it has generated a profit two years in a row.In fact, only 4.2 percent of all I.P.O.s in the United States were led by woman from 2000 to 2015. That compares to 6.4 percent of Fortune 500 companies run by a woman.The reasons are well known: The internet and newer players like Netflix have upended the media and telecom landscapes. Size and scale seem more important than ever. It\u2019s the premise of the AT&T and Time Warner deal, which itself echoes Comcast buying NBCUniversal.More in media consolidationAcross the industry, digital-media companies are finding that lines of business that caught fire for them early on \u2014 like creating custom content for brands \u2014 are becoming harder to scale up. Meanwhile, with each passing year, Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. are tightening their grip on the online-ad market.Extra creditThe leak of 210,000 gallons in South Dakota came days before the Public Services Commission of Nebraska is to vote on a permit for the pipeline\u2019s bigger sibling, Keystone XL.After his election, President Trump issued an executive order to clear obstacles for the Keystone XL, but TransCanada still needed a permit from the independent, five-person Nebraska PSC.

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Is Said to Plan Repeal of Net Neutrality Rules", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA rollback of net neutrality regulations would represent a significant victory for broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast and would amount to a strike against consumers. When the rules were passed in 2015, they underlined the importance of high-speed internet to the lives of Americans and the need to more strongly regulate the communications service like a utility, as essential as electricity and the telephone.But under a repeal, companies like AT&T and Comcast may be able to charge people higher fees to access certain websites and online services. The companies may also be able to prioritize their own services while disadvantaging websites run by rivals.In addition, Mr. Pai plans to reverse a decision from the Obama administration that declared broadband be treated like a utility, the people said. That classification had opened the door to many more regulations for broadband providers.The F.C.C. did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the repeal plans.Consumer groups and Democrats denounced the proposed changes.\u201cIt ain\u2019t broke, so why fix it?\u201d Julius Genachowski, a former Democratic chairman of the F.C.C., said in an interview. \u201cThe core rules of no blocking, no discrimination, and transparency have worked to create an ecosystem of innovation and investment that\u2019s the envy of the rest of the world.\u201dNet neutrality has long been a thorny topic that has ignited lobbying battles and heated debate between internet and telecom companies. On one side, broadband companies have argued that the regulations encumbered their business plans. On the other side, tech giants like Google and Amazon said that without such rules, the broadband providers could become gatekeepers of what internet content reached consumers.While some of the largest companies can afford to pay for faster delivery of their online content, start-ups like Etsy and Reddit, which have been fierce defenders of net neutrality, have said smaller companies would be squashed by what they view as tolls just to make sure their sites reach consumers.During the Obama administration, the head of the F.C.C., Tom Wheeler, said net neutrality regulations were necessary to prevent a company like Verizon from slowing down the delivery of a service like Netflix or Sling TV, which competes with Verizon\u2019s video service, Fios.Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal to scrap net neutrality rules is the latest in a deregulation blitz that includes the rollback of media ownership and broadband privacy rules. Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump, opposed the rules when they were created in 2015, saying they would stifle investment by broadband providers.More recently, Mr. Pai has clearly signaled his opposition to net neutrality. He has called the rules an example of government overreach in the fast-growing broadband industry. In April, a few months after he was named F.C.C. chairman, he announced his intention to overhaul the rules, saying the threat of harm to consumers was only theoretical.\u201cThe truth of the matter is that we decided to abandon successful policies solely because of hypothetical harms and hysterical prophecies of doom,\u201d Mr. Pai said in an April speech about the creation of the net neutrality rules.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Plans Net Neutrality Repeal in a Victory for Telecoms", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Communications Commission released a plan on Tuesday to dismantle landmark regulations that ensure equal access to the internet, clearing the way for internet service companies to charge users more to see certain content and to curb access to some websites.The proposal, made by the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, is a sweeping repeal of rules put in place by the Obama administration. The rules prohibit high-speed internet service providers, or I.S.P.s, from stopping or slowing down the delivery of websites. They also prevent the companies from charging customers extra fees for high-quality streaming and other services.The announcement set off a fight over free speech and the control of the internet, pitting telecom titans like AT&T and Verizon against internet giants like Google and Amazon. The internet companies warned that rolling back the rules could make the telecom companies powerful gatekeepers to information and entertainment. The telecom companies say that the existing rules prevent them from offering customers a wider selection of services at higher and lower price points.\u201cUnder my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,\u201d Mr. Pai said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that\u2019s best for them.\u201dMr. Pai, a Republican who has pursued an aggressive deregulation agenda, was widely expected to have his plan approved during a meeting on Dec. 14. The two other Republicans on the commission generally vote with Mr. Pai, giving them a majority over the two Democrats.Telecom and internet companies are expected to lobby hard in Washington \u2014 and directly to the public \u2014 as they did when the current rules were adopted.Some internet companies were expected to put up a fight to prevent the proposal from taking hold. The Internet Association, an industry group, joined a legal effort in 2015 to protect the existing rules. The agency has already received 20 million public comments, many of them in opposition of changing the rules, since Mr. Pai announced the broad outlines of his thinking early this year.The big companies that provide internet access to phones and computers have fought for years against broadband regulations. Under the new plan, broadband providers will be able to block access, slow down or speed up service for its business partners in some cases \u2014 as long as they notify customers.\u201cThis action will return broadband in the U.S. to a regulatory regime that emphasizes private investment and innovation over lumbering government intervention,\u201d said Joan Marsh, a vice president at AT&T.\u201cWe are disappointed that the proposal announced today by the F.C.C. fails to maintain the strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Erin Egan, a vice president at Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cWe will work with all stakeholders committed to this principle.\u201dSmall online companies believe the proposal would hurt innovation, because telecom companies could force them to pay more for the faster connections. Only the largest companies, they say, would be able to afford the expense of making sure their sites received preferred treatment. Companies like Etsy and Pinterest, for example, credit their start to the promise of free and open access on the internet.And consumers, the online companies say, may see their costs go up if, for example, they want high-quality access to popular websites like Netflix, a company that depends on fast connections for its streaming videos. Netflix said on Tuesday that it opposed Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal.The action \u201crepresents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Google, Facebook, Amazon and other tech companies.Mr. Pai said the current rules had been adopted to stop only theoretical harm. He said the rules limit consumer choice because telecom companies cannot offer different tiers of service, for example. As a result, he said, internet service companies cannot experiment with new business models that could help them compete with online businesses like Netflix, Google and Facebook.\u201cIt\u2019s depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation,\u201d Mr. Pai said Tuesday.Comcast, one of the country\u2019s biggest broadband companies, said it would not slow websites that contain legally permitted material.\u201cWe do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content \u2014 and we will be transparent with our customers about these policies,\u201d the company said.In a call with reporters, F.C.C. officials said the blocking and slowing of some content could be seen as anticompetitive. Those practices, they said, would be policed by the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department.Mr. Pai, who was appointed chairman by President Trump in January, has eliminated numerous regulations during his first year.The agency has stripped down rules governing television broadcasters, newspapers and telecom companies that were meant to protect the public interest. On Tuesday, in addition to the net neutrality rollback, Mr. Pai announced a plan to eliminate a rule limiting any corporation from controlling broadcasts that can reach more than 39 percent of American homes.The fight over net neutrality could end up being one of his biggest and most fraught decisions. For more than a decade, the agency has struggled with how to regulate internet service, leading to extended legal battles. The rules adopted under Mr. Wheeler were upheld in 2016 by a federal appeals court in Washington.The proposal released on Tuesday will probably make its way to court as well. And companies like Google and Facebook are expected to push the public to speak out against the plan. They coordinated a huge online protest against the possible changes in July.Some of the lobbying could take place in Congress, even though it may change little because Republicans control both houses. Nevertheless, Democrats have vowed to try to reconstruct the strict rules adopted by the F.C.C. in 2015.The next three weeks promise to hold intense lobbying from both sides, but that might not be the end of it. The regulation of internet providers has already swung once on a change in the Oval Office.\u201cAs good as the F.C.C.\u2019s action is for I.S.P.s, it only assures nonregulation of broadband through 2020,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the research firm Cowen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Can the Oscars Celebrate in Weinstein\u2019s Long Shadow?", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe CarpetbaggerOy vey, it\u2019s awards season again. Could there be a worse time for Hollywood to celebrate itself?It was around this time last year \u2014 i.e., a more innocent time \u2014 that the fair people of Tinseltown began using acceptance speeches to shake their manicured fists at Donald J. Trump.Even if more players from the entertainment world hadn\u2019t been accused of sexual misconduct or harassment, the gravity of the accusations leveled at Mr. Weinstein \u2014 who has denied allegations of nonconsensual sex \u2014 would still have injected a stink into the awards season this year.Mr. Weinstein may have been expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but he has left lasting marks on the Oscars race. He elevated and made a blood sport out of campaigning. Guild and ancillary awards matter more now in part because of him: He fought bareknuckled for every prize.Though his power had sharply waned from his heyday, which lasted from the \u201990s through the aughts, Mr. Weinstein\u2019s outsized presence and shameless politicking were awards-season staples. His reputation for being a bully endured, but he was also beheld as a grandstanding lion in winter, one who prompted eye rolls and the perennial question, \u201cWhat will Harvey pull this year?\u201dNow that Mr. Weinstein faces a mountain of damning corroborated evidence, his tactics seem tinged with malevolence, fronts for a man who abused women and used the promise of Oscar gold as bait.He might be gone, but his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s remain. Former Weinstein Company employees have gone on to jobs at Netflix, Lionsgate, Warner Bros., Focus Features, Sony Pictures Entertainment and A&E Networks. The most prominent awards strategists \u2014 Tony Angelotti, Cynthia Swartz, Lisa Taback \u2014 worked closely with him for years. Several former employees said they did not know the terrible extent of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior, though some were on the receiving end of his infamous wrath, which now seems like another front of sorts, too.Still, questions about who else knew what, when, hang heavy. And crassly or not, insiders began speculating about how the sexual harassment revelations would affect this year\u2019s Oscars race as soon as the Weinstein news broke. That\u2019s a shame, because this year\u2019s race boasts a bumper crop of movies that aren\u2019t exclusively about or made by straight white men.Even the filmmakers who hastened to rid themselves of any association with accused abusers ended up making the scandals indelibly part of their films\u2019 narratives.Questions will invariably swirl around the Oscars ceremony itself, like what might or might not be said if Casey Affleck, who has settled two sexual harassment suits and was last season\u2019s best actor winner, will show. It\u2019s Oscar tradition for the previous year\u2019s best actor winner to hand out a statuette. Close attention will be paid to the host, Jimmy Kimmel, who handled last season\u2019s best picture snafu with heartfelt grace.He was hardly serious, but regardless, fat chance, and not just because Hollywood isn\u2019t known to atone.Mr. Weinstein may be dead to Hollywood, but his victims and survivors are not. Let\u2019s bring them all together, onstage, en mighty masse.An earlier version of this article misstated the awards strategist Tony Angelotti\u2019s relationship with Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Angelotti did not work at Mr. Weinstein\u2019s companies, though the two men did work closely together over the years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Originals That Don\u2019t Get to the Theater", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingNetflix\u2019s disinclination to release its original films in theaters has earned the company disapprobation from cinephiles, and caused a brouhaha at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival. There\u2019s a logic to this: The company is a video streaming service, after all. Hardly anybody complains that HBO doesn\u2019t release its films theatrically. The difference has to do with conventional wisdom. Because Netflix is producing significant films by celebrated directors like Bong Joon-ho (this year\u2019s \u201cOkja\u201d) and Martin Scorsese (whose \u201cThe Irishman\u201d will make its Netflix premiere in early 2019), there\u2019s a perceived imperative that they need to be seen on large screens and in the company of a lot of other people.And yet, nobody demanded that \u201cPublic Speaking,\u201d a 2010 documentary about the writer Fran Lebowitz that was 100 percent directed by Martin Scorsese for HBO, get a theatrical run. What can I tell you? There\u2019s a tendency for some to see a film made for television as somehow not a proper film. It takes years to change that perception (see Rainer Werner Fassbinder\u2019s early \u201970s TV movie \u201cWorld on a Wire\u201d or his monumental limited TV series \u201cBerlin Alexanderplatz\u201d).\u201cCreep 2,\u201d produced in part by Netflix, is streaming now on Amazon, Fandango, Google Play and iTunes and is coming to Netflix later this year. Spoiler alert: Since the sequel takes up where the 2014 original, \u201cCreep,\u201d ended, it begins with Mark Duplass playing the same serial killer as before. The hook in both pictures, very appropriate for postmodern microbudget filmmaking, is that this killer attracts his victims by soliciting for videographers on Craigslist. The twist here, if it can be called that, is that Mr. Duplass\u2019s serial killer admits right off to the failed webcaster Sara (Desiree Akhavan) that he\u2019s a murderer. He wants the video he\u2019s commissioned to be his testament. Pairing male serial killer with female videographer might generate some tensions beyond the usual, and indeed, Mr. Duplass\u2019s character gets buck naked in front of Sara\u2019s camera in the first step of what he deems a trust-building exercise. But this movie generates most of its shocks the same way the first one did: via use of a deliberately clunky subjective camera, in front of which Mr. Duplass will periodically jump from behind a door or a corner and scream \u201cBoo!\u201d or some variant thereof. As Orson Welles once said, \u201cunrewarding.\u201dI had higher hopes for \u201c1922,\u201d adapted from a novella by Stephen King that\u2019s unrelentingly grim, even by his standards. It tells the story of a farm-life-fixated dolt who kills his wife rather than sit still for her plan to sell off her land and move to Omaha. Manipulating his teenage son\u2019s resentments, he enlists the boy in the homicide. Things get worse from there, with hallucinations (or are they?) of the walking dead and lots of rats.The film, directed by Zak Hilditch from his own screenplay, is a handsome-looking production that\u2019s sunk almost immediately by its practically reflexive devotion to cornpone clich\u00e9. On the page, the reader can hear the killer Wilfred James\u2019s words of confession \u2014 \u201cI believe there is another man inside of every man, a stranger, a Conniving Man\u201d \u2014 in any way he or she likes. In the movie, the actor Thomas Jane, as Wilfred, uses a cracker-barrel intonation that leads us to believe that at any moment he may punctuate his narration with the old faux-homey TV ad for baked goods: \u201cPepperidge Farm remembers.\u201dMr. Jane\u2019s performance is that of an actor portraying a type rather than a character, and it contrasts starkly with Molly Parker\u2019s work. Alas, Ms. Parker plays the wife, so she\u2019s not around all that long. (She comes back, but is not required to do much more than look rat-bitten, which the makeup department handles well.) Throughout the picture I kept thinking, this will surely get better as the scary scenes come around. Not only did it not get better, the scary scenes did not come around.I\u2019m hoping things look up in 2018. Eighty movies is a lot, and if too many are like these, I may lose my faith in cinema on any screen.An earlier version of this column misstated where viewers can stream the film \u201cCreep 2.\u201d It is currently available on Amazon, Fandango, Google Play and iTunes, not on Netflix.Advertisement"}

Among the finale\u2019s revelations: Chantal was alive in Montreal, oblivious to the chaos her absence had caused. And Keith (Ron Livingston), the private detective Dory hooked up with in the belief that he was working for Chantal\u2019s family, had met his bloody demise. Or had he?Now that she has located Chantal, where should we expect to find Dory?The most interesting shows are when you watch an evolution of the character. Dory started off very lost. Her kindness was misinterpreted for weakness. Then she discovered something that she was good at, that she cared about because she thought it was helping other people. She\u2019s been so blindly self-obsessed that she didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d alienated those closest to her. So, in the second season, she\u2019s unveiling that she\u2019s not what she thought she was.\u201cSearch Party\u201d has been called one of the most realistic portrayals of millennials on TV. Millennials definitely think that they\u2019re doing something for somebody else, when it\u2019s actually just a selfish act. The show\u2019s main characters are kind of despicable people, and at the end, Dory realizes that she\u2019s actually the worst off. And I think they\u2019re relatable because the creators Charles Rogers and Sarah-Violet Bliss write as if they\u2019re people they\u2019ve known for a long time, where you know their worst qualities but still really care about them.Honestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get any better physically. I\u2019m at my peak. But yeah, if it\u2019s right for the story, then it completely makes sense to me.

I\u2019ve looked back at times I thought I had under control, where I now go, \u201cI should have said something instead of laughing it off.\u201d Now I don\u2019t feel nervous to call somebody out and say, \u201cThat\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d Especially in the comedy world, a lot of inappropriate things fly.

AT&T says that it is battling tech giants with plenty of negotiating leverage.Google\u2019s YouTube, for instance, began life without any Time Warner networks, suggesting \u2014 to AT&T, at least \u2014 that channels like TNT, CNN and TBS were inessential.\u201cTime Warner accounts for a valuable, but exceptionally thin, slice of all the video content available to consumers, and AT&T\u2019s legacy video distribution platforms are being squeezed by cable incumbents and tech giants alike.\u201dTo prove that it would not abuse any increase in power that buying Time Warner would afford, AT&T said that it had offered rival distributors the same sort of deal that the government allowed in the last big vertical media merger: Comcast\u2019s purchase of NBCUniversal.That means:\u2022 Letting rival video providers make use of so-called baseball-style arbitration in any dispute involving Turner\u2019s channels.

The announcement followed a rancorous proxy fight by activist investor Mick McGuire, which resulted in his firm Marcato Capital Management placing three directors \u2014 including Mr. McGuire \u2014 onto Buffalo Wild Wings\u2019 board.Marcato, which owns 6.4 percent of Buffalo Wild Wings, said it will vote in favor of the Arby\u2019s deal.

The reason why? Primarily that Emerson couldn\u2019t meet its fellow industrial parts maker\u2019s price expectations \u2014 and had no other negotiating levers to pull.Rockwell had repeatedly said that it viewed the takeover bids as too low. By going public, Emerson was hoping to get shareholders in the target company to apply pressure on management. That didn\u2019t work, however: Shares in Rockwell never meaningfully approached the level of any of its suitor\u2019s proposals, suggesting that investors weren\u2019t particularly hoping for a deal.And Rockwell had some defenses that Emerson couldn\u2019t breach, including a staggered board and no provision for shareholders to call special meetings. That meant Emerson couldn\u2019t wage a proper proxy fight to replace directors at the target company\u2019s board.\u201cInstead of engaging in constructive dialogue, the Rockwell board decided to let this unique and value-generative opportunity go unexplored,\u201d David Farr, Emerson\u2019s chairman and C.E.O., said in a statement.Looks like deal junkies will have to wait for Broadcom to go hostile against Qualcomm for their merger fight fix.It has now been more than three weeks since Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the face of the kingdom\u2019s business elite for decades, was detained without explanation as part of a purported anticorruption drive.

Absolutely.\u201dWhere we stand on the Senate Budget Committee vote:Tax flyaround: Moreover, secondary offerings like what SoftBank is pursuing tend to be at a lower valuation than primary ones in which a company sells new shares. (Uber is also selling new stock to the Japanese conglomerate at its current valuation of $78.5 billion.)But some investors will be disappointed in the lower valuation in any case, and will see in it an appraisal of Uber\u2019s challenges: its chronically fractious board; its grappling with regulatory challenges around the world; and its latest headache, a hacking scandal that had been kept under wraps until recently.The Uber flyaround:At least, it has on some Korean exchanges.

{"Headline": "On London Stages, Britain Considers Its Divided Soul", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrantley in BritainLONDON \u2014 \u201cAre you guys anything anymore?\u201d the American comedian Kathy Griffin asked from the stage of the Palladium Theater here on Friday night. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to call you. Blokes?\u201dBut she had a point that extended beyond her uncharacteristic reluctance to offend. As Britain hovers on the brink of separation from the European Union, its sense of itself \u2014 as a place, as a people, as a culture \u2014 has seldom seemed less certain.Signifiers and symbols that have long shouted \u201cForever England\u201d are the subject of bewildered and fractious debate this cold and sunless November.So it felt fitting that I should devote the first Saturday of my visit here to watching the English contemplating the end of England in a distinctly English way. That meant six (yes, six) hours of sceptered-isle navel gazing courtesy of two fecund and inventive young British playwrights, James Graham and Mike Bartlett.This may sound like a joyless prospect. But it\u2019s amazing how quickly the traffic of the stage passes when you\u2019re in the hands of expert craftsmen.There is warming solace, after all, in people gathering to hear their collective identity crisis discussed in such well-spoken terms. (This is true even for uneasy Americans like me, whose own viciously conflicted nation has been keeping them awake at nights.)Theatergoers here will recognize such plays as part of a long tradition of literary introspection. It is one that stretches back to at least the days of that other Queen Elizabeth, when Shakespeare\u2019s characters tear out their hair over their imperiled country\u2019s divisions, and has been sustained by 20th- and 21st-century writers including John Osborne, David Hare and Caryl Churchill.What\u2019s more, though their subjects may be absolutely of the moment, \u201cLabour of Love,\u201d an anxious comedy, and \u201cAlbion,\u201d a state-of-the-nation drama, are both old-fashioned in form. This is not necessarily to be expected of either of their creators.In this case, though, the salt-of-the-earth Tracy character is a woman, Jean Whittaker, a longtime stalwart of the local party in a working-class mining town. The patrician Hepburn type is a rising politician, with a public school accent and impeccably tailored suits.That\u2019s the first act, anyway. The second act reverts to conventional chronology, beginning in 1994 and picking up where each scene in the previous act ended. The structure embodies the play\u2019s central and cleverly executed motif of mirror images.I\u2019m making the plot sound more complicated than it feels. Interspersed with time-capsule video montages that show the changing faces of British government, the production moves with the barbed breeziness of an Alan Ayckbourn comedy.It is a battle to which Mr. Freeman and Ms. Greig lend a deliciously combustible chemistry. And though the divided Britain of 2017 inspires lamentations about a party \u2014 and a nation \u2014 at war within itself, \u201cLabour\u201d dares to end on a note of guarded but cheering optimism.Albion once belonged to the uncle of Audrey Walters (Ms. Hamilton), the self-made head of a home furnishings empire and a bereaved mother whose soldier son was killed in Iraq. She is determined to restore it to its former glory. She is also, of course, hoping to resurrect an England of long ago, of material solidity and a clear-cut social structure.It isn\u2019t a spoiler to say that this project is inevitably doomed. An end-of-days tone of Chekhovian melancholy pervades the show from its opening moments.And Mr. Bartlett borrows unapologetically from both Chekhov\u2019s \u201cThe Cherry Orchard\u201d and \u201cThe Seagull\u201d for his portrayal of the characters here. They include Audrey\u2019s benignly parasitic husband (an excellent Nicholas Rowe); her best friend, a swaggering and emotionally destructive novelist (Helen Schlesinger); and Audrey\u2019s dangerously impressionable daughter (Charlotte Hope), who has artistic leanings of her own.The fact that there is no place in contemporary Britain for the Albion of yore is explored in clashes among classes and generations. These are enacted in dialogue that, by Mr. Bartlett\u2019s standards, often feels surprisingly banal, as if recycled from a century\u2019s worth of country house dramas.But Mr. Goold\u2019s production, featuring a deceptively simple design by Miriam Buether, has been most engagingly staged. (The ways in which the garden comes to life is a marvel.) And the acting, especially from Ms. Hamilton, is passionate and persuasive.For all its depiction of a world spinning off its axis, \u201cAlbion\u201d affords the pleasures of a vintage, soul-searching British novel. In asking the question of who will inherit what remains of the British Empire, it brings to mind one literary classic in particular. And when I turned on the television the next night, there on the screen was a new adaptation of that very work.Advertisement"}

Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, disclosed those tidbits on a conference call with analysts.But there was no way around the quarterly results: Disney suffered declines in revenue and profitability at three of its four major divisions. Only theme parks had growth \u2014 albeit tamped down by Hurricane Irma, which closed Walt Disney World in Florida for two days and forced the cancellation of Disney Cruise Line itineraries.ABC and its sister production arm, ABC Studios, have suffered a dry spell. In the quarter, operating income at the division anchored by ABC fell 15 percent, to $229 million, because of a lack of hits and lower political advertising at Disney\u2019s chain of local television stations.\u201cWe\u2019ve had some disappointments on the ABC side, but we\u2019ve been focused on turning that around,\u201d Mr. Iger said. \u201cSome improvement from a quality aspect would be helpful.\u201d He added that he was encouraged by viewership for a new drama, \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d which is produced by Sony Pictures Television.For its fourth fiscal quarter, Disney had net income of $1.75 billion, or $1.13 a share, compared with $1.77 billion, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier. Revenue totaled $12.78 billion, a 3 percent decline.Excluding one-time items, Disney had per-share income of $1.07. Analysts had been expecting slightly more.Disney\u2019s usual bugbear, ESPN, was also a factor. Disney said its cable networks group, which includes ESPN and has historically served as a growth engine, had operating income of $1.24 billion, a 1 percent decline. At ESPN, advertising revenue fell because of lower ratings. The cable sports giant also suffered continued subscriber erosion because of cord cutting. Higher carriage fees from pay-TV providers helped offset declines.\u201cThe losses were not as deep as they had been in prior quarters,\u201d Mr. Iger said of ESPN subscriber declines. \u201cWe\u2019re heartened by that.\u201dDisney Consumer Products and Interactive Media had operating income of $373 million, a 12 percent decline, because of lower merchandise sales. Christine M. McCarthy, Disney\u2019s chief financial officer, said sales of \u201cCars 3\u201d toys had been \u201ca little bit lighter than we would have liked.\u201dThat left Walt Disney Parks and Resorts to pick up the slack. Operating income in that division totaled $746 million, a 7 percent increase. Growth at parks in Paris and Shanghai offset the impact of Hurricane Irma on Disney World in Florida and Disney Cruise Line.Advertisement"}

Well, 15 million people watched the premiere episode of the most recent season of \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d the biggest hit on cable; the first episode of NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us\u201d was watched by 17.8 million people; and the premiere episode of the latest season of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d was watched by 22 million people. The season finale of HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d had 14.8 million viewers within three days of its broadcast; the premium cable network said that more than 30 million people watched each episode this past season once streaming numbers were factored in.In a statement on Thursday, a spokeswoman said, \u201cTheir math might be from the upside down,\u201d referring to the alternate dimension in \u201cStranger Things.\u201dNielsen\u2019s data is drawn from television sets using audio recognition software, so it cannot measure viewers who watch a Netflix show on a tablet, laptop or phone. That suggests the number of viewers for \u201cStranger Things\u201d is actually even larger.Further, Nielsen\u2019s numbers track only domestic users, and Netflix now has more paying international subscribers (52.7 million) than it does in the United States (51.3 million).There is some skepticism within the TV industry about how accurate Nielsen\u2019s streaming numbers will be, but many acknowledge they are an important step in finding a reliable third-party measurement system. Nielsen does not yet track Amazon or Hulu but said it hopes to.According to Nielsen, the ratings decline for each episode of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d though that likely has to do with the fact that a viewer can\u2019t get to all of the episodes within three days.Nielsen did say that 4.6 million viewers finished the entire nine-episode season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d between Friday and Sunday last weekend. And 361,000 people managed to watch the whole season within a day.Advertisement"}

Nabors has one of the episode\u2019s funniest moments, when Gomer hesitates to crawl under the bandstand for fear of spiders.

{"Headline": "A New \u2018She\u2019s Gotta Have It\u2019: Spike Lee\u2019s Feminist Breakthrough", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAs a sex positive, polyamorous, pansexual,\u201d Nola Darling, the 27-year-old heroine of Spike Lee\u2019s new television series, \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d boldly declares in the fourth episode, \u201cwords like monogamy have never even seemed like a remote possibility.\u201dThe surprising result: Spike Lee has made his most feminist heroine yet.In an interview earlier this month, Mr. Lee was less defensive. \u201cI\u2019m 30 years older, and the world has changed,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cI think that Nola\u2019s character is such a strong character. She is a woman who is juggling three men, and I think there are more women like that now. But the way those women are judged hasn\u2019t necessarily changed as far as men go.\u201dThe move to television \u2014 and having 10 30-minute episodes to play with \u2014 has also contributed to the evolution, allowing Mr. Lee to flesh out Nola (played by DeWanda Wise with an alluring mix of charisma, vulnerability and confidence). \u201cWe shot \u2018She\u2019s Gotta Have It\u2019 in 12 days in summer of 1985, and it was 86 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis thing cost millions and was a 63-day shoot. We have a much bigger canvas, and a bigger canvas gave us more time and more resources to show Nola Darling, a struggling artist today in gentrified Fort Greene.\u201dAnd with television came a writer\u2019s room, one that Mr. Lee filled with African-American female artists and writers, including his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, whom Mr. Lee credited for conceiving the film as a series. (Besides several children\u2019s books, including \u201cPlease, Baby, Please,\u201d which recast Mars Blackmon\u2019s humorously desperate plea to Nola as a parental appeal to an inexhaustible toddler, this is the couple\u2019s first major project together.)\u201cNola is a female character created by a man. In the process of making a show, that became even more apparent,\u201d said Ms. Lewis Lee, who is an executive producer on the show. \u201cSo we added female voices to put the meat on the bones of this female character, and there would be moments where Spike was like, \u2018I don\u2019t understand what you guys are talking about.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s because you\u2019re a man, and there are things you can\u2019t see as a man, as open as you try to be. So listen to us, and let us help you.\u2019 And he did.\u201dOne conversation in particular stood out to her. It involved the scene in which a slightly inebriated Nola, after spending the evening hanging and drinking with her best friend, Clorinda, stumbles down the street to her home. \u201cAs a woman looking at that, it\u2019s very different, you recognize that real vulnerability that you feel,\u201d Ms. Lewis Lee said. \u201cAnd sometimes men don\u2019t see that.\u201dOf the eight writers credited, four are women \u2014 Radha Blank, Eisa Davis, Joie Lee (Mr. Lee\u2019s sister) and the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Lynn Nottage (\u201cRuined\u201d and \u201cSweat\u201d). And their involvement has altered the depiction of Opal, a lesbian character who Ms. Hooks previously described as \u201cpredatory.\u201d\u201cTimes have changed,\u201d Ms. Nottage said. \u201cAnd Opal appears in a very different way now. Opal offers Nola stability and love in a way she struggles with some of the men.\u201dMs. Nottage added that Nola is \u201ca woman who is polyamorous with fluid sexuality\u201d and is incredibly attracted to Opal as a lover as well.The show does not only expand Nola\u2019s sexual universe, it also pays attention to the ways in which her and other black female characters\u2019 bodies are constantly under surveillance (by white shopkeepers), exploited (at a local burlesque club or on reality TV), threatened (by police officers) and even assaulted (by everyday men on the street).\u201cThe original film ends with this very violent attack against Nola, which wasn\u2019t adequately addressed,\u201d Ms. Nottage said, referring to the highly criticized scene in which Jaime rapes Nola. \u201cI think now we have the tools to have that conversation, particularly in the African-American community, in a really open way.\u201dThe rape scene does not appear in the TV version of \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d Instead, in the first episode, Nola is assaulted on the street by a stranger, serving as a catalyst for her to find her voice as an artist and activist.As an oil painter of African-American portraits and a guerrilla-style artist who anonymously begins an anti-street harassment campaign, Nola represents Mr. Lee\u2019s native Brooklyn, the frequent setting and subject of most of his films, at a crossroads.While \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d seems attuned to the complexities of these women\u2019s stories, the show also grapples \u2014 in a more sustained way than in the movie \u2014 with the tensions and traumas of gentrification. In this way, Nola is a far more radical artist and, for that matter, character than her contemporary Brooklynites on \u201cGirls,\u201d \u201cSearch Party\u201d and even the racially diverse \u201cMaster of None.\u201d For her, struggle as an artist is heightened by rising rents; cultural disagreements with her new, affluent white neighbors; and the displacement of black residents who, like her, have lived in Brooklyn their entire lives.\u201cWith gentrification, no one talks about people who get moved out \u2014 that\u2019s never the conversation,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cGod bless, if we get two more seasons, we can explore these things, the good and the bad, about the Republic of Brooklyn.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Ford Turn Itself Into a Tech Company?", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "Mcity, as the facility is known, was built by the University of Michigan as a testing ground for automakers, including Ford, which has been experimenting with self-driving cars here for about two years. I parked my rental and climbed into the back of a white Ford Fusion with four spinning Lidar sensors on the roof, each roughly the size of a water glass, and a rack of high-performance computers in the trunk. Next to me sat Randy Visintainer, Ford\u2019s director of autonomous vehicle development. Jakob Hoellerbauer, a young Ford engineer, took the driver\u2019s seat. Wayne Williams, a Ford research scientist, sat beside him in the passenger seat typing on a laptop. We put on our seatbelts, and Hoellerbauer hit the ignition and pulled into the road. A beep came from the dashboard, indicating that the car was ready to engage self-driving mode. Hoellerbauer pushed a button on the steering wheel and took his hands away.\u201cWe are now autonomous,\u201d Williams announced.The car glided along Main Street to a four-way stop, waited for another car (driven by a researcher) to clear the intersection, then made a gentle right turn. Autonomous cars are programmed to drive conservatively, and any time our Fusion sensed an approaching object \u2014 like a Ford employee, role-playing an oblivious pedestrian \u2014 it slowed down until it was sure the path was clear, then proceeded cautiously. It felt like being chauffeured by an elderly ghost.Two minutes into the drive, the car pulled around a traffic circle and up to a blinking red light at an empty intersection. It stopped. A few seconds passed. Perhaps, I thought, it was just being characteristically risk-averse. Then a few more seconds passed, and the engineers started to look nervous. Williams squinted at his laptop.\u201cSo right now, we\u2019re not sure if the intersection is clear, so we\u2019re being very cautious,\u201d Williams said, speaking for the car. \u201cIt\u2019s expecting ...\u201d He trailed off and turned to Hoellerbauer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just overtake it?\u201d Hoellerbauer grabbed the wheel and tapped the gas pedal, overriding the self-driving system and manually steering us through the intersection.\u201cWe didn\u2019t see that happen this morning,\u201d Williams explained, by way of an apology. We took another lap around Mcity, and when we reached the intersection again, the car did the exact same thing.Self-driving cars raise the specter of horrific malfunctions \u2014 a code glitch that sends a car careering off a cliff, a remote hack that disables the brakes \u2014 but perfectly innocuous problems like the one we experienced will be far more common, and no less an impediment to road-readiness. There are dozens of autonomous vehicles being tested all over the world \u2014 43 companies are testing 295 different self-driving vehicles in California alone \u2014 and not one of them has a clean record. A self-driving Uber vehicle zoomed through a red light in San Francisco last year. The sensors on cars used by Waymo, the self-driving-car division of Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent, have struggled in heavy rain and snow. I\u2019ve had half a dozen self-driving-car experiences in my life, including a white-knuckle trip down Manhattan\u2019s West Side Highway in a Tesla Model X whose owner had set it to \u201cautopilot\u201d mode, and I wouldn\u2019t describe any of them as relaxing.How quickly these rides will improve depends on whom you ask. Silicon Valley futurists, in typically sanguine fashion, predict that we are months, not years, away from a Cambrian explosion of autonomous cars. Waymo has a pilot program for its self-driving vehicles already underway in Arizona and says it\u2019s \u201creally close\u201d to being fully operational. Lyft, which has partnered with a start-up called Drive.ai, is aiming to have a fleet of self-driving cars operating in the Bay Area by the end of the year. And Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, which has offered semiautonomous features since 2015, has suggested that its cars could be fully autonomous as soon as 2019.But that\u2019s California, where optimism is the coin of the realm. In Detroit, the timeline looks slower and more incremental. Ford, in particular, believes that the first generation of driverless cars will be limited, capable of traveling only in commercial fleets inside carefully plotted urban areas. Other cars will simply get smarter without being autonomous, with features like collision prevention and self-parking becoming more common. Self-driving technology will eventually be more sophisticated and will one day be capable of full door-to-door autonomy in every possible area and condition, but as Ford sees it, that\u2019s not going to happen overnight, or even very soon.Despite its pragmatic restraint, Ford has invested hundreds of millions in self-driving cars and is making surprising progress. In a report earlier this year, Navigant Research placed Ford at the top of its leader board, ahead of tech companies like Waymo and Uber as well as auto rivals like GM and Toyota, based on Ford\u2019s advanced manufacturing capabilities coupled with its strides in software development. The report generated headlines like, \u201cDetroit Is Kicking Silicon Valley\u2019s Ass in the Race to Build Self-Driving Cars,\u201d and delivered a morale boost to Ford, which showed up late but finally felt as if it had a chance.Ford\u2019s big, blinking target is 2021 \u2014 the year it hopes to release a vehicle that meets the Society of Automotive Engineers International\u2019s definition of Level 4 autonomy (no human operator required in the area and conditions it\u2019s programmed for). It\u2019s a tough deadline for a company whose culture might be the exact opposite of Silicon Valley\u2019s, where companies release half-finished \u201cminimum viable products\u201d and abide by maxims like \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d Before Ford \u2014 or any conventional automaker \u2014 produces anything, each part has to pass a grueling battery of tests and certifications. There is a reason \u201cautomotive grade\u201d has become a synonym for \u201creliable.\u201d \u201cOur vehicles have to be a trusted product,\u201d Chris Brewer, Ford\u2019s chief engineer for autonomous vehicles, told me. \u201cThat is a little more important than \u2018Did my phone freeze or not?\u2019\u2009\u201dAmericans are wary of driverless cars \u2014 56 percent, according to the Pew Research Center, would prefer not to ride in one \u2014 and when I talked to Brewer, it occurred to me that some part of that hesitation might stem from who we assume will be producing them: Silicon Valley tech giants, the same stateless behemoths that have spent the last few decades barging into old-line industries like the Kool-Aid Man, destroying working-class jobs and leaving behind cold, modern efficiency. But maybe these skeptics could be persuaded to trust Detroit. After all, Brewer is right \u2014 self-driving cars aren\u2019t smartphones. They\u2019re two-ton projectiles that take your parents to the grocery store and your kids to soccer practice, that will need to make billions of computational decisions per second while moving at 65 miles per hour, that contain within them the power to extinguish human life. You kind of want them to take a while.Leading Ford into this weird new era is Jim Hackett, who was named chief executive in May. Hackett, 62, is an oddity by Detroit standards. A design-minded aesthete in an industry dominated by gearheads and number crunchers, he spent two decades running Steelcase, a Michigan-based office-furniture company whose designers are often credited with \u2014 or blamed for \u2014 popularizing the open-plan office trend.At a conference several years ago, Hackett struck up a conversation with Ford\u2019s executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., who goes by Bill. He is the great-grandson of Henry Ford, and another auto-world misfit \u2014 an outspoken environmentalist who once ruffled feathers at Ford by speaking at a Greenpeace event. The two bonded over their shared vision of \u201csmart mobility,\u201d a fuzzy term, more common among urbanists than businesspeople, for creating a sort of harmony among land use, technology and transportation of all forms. Hackett joined Ford\u2019s board of directors in 2013. In 2016, Bill Ford persuaded Hackett to lead Ford\u2019s newly created smart-mobility unit, and about a year later, he tapped him to run the entire company.Hackett\u2019s jockish C.V. \u2014 he played football at Michigan and briefly ran the school\u2019s athletic department \u2014 masks his high-minded streak, which can make talking to him feel like taking a college philosophy seminar after a few bong rips. In the early 2000s, he began traveling to the Santa Fe Institute, a research group started by prominent scientists who wanted to study \u201ccomplex adaptive systems\u201d \u2014 a branch of theoretical physics that imagines the world as a series of complicated networks that are governed by universal laws and patterns, the same way biology is guided by Darwinian evolution. The rules that explained how anthills formed, they believed, might also explain urbanization trends in Southeast Asia or predict economic cycles. It was a formative experience for Hackett, who began to believe that businesses were governed by universal laws, too.Hackett also became obsessed with \u201cdesign thinking,\u201d a new-agey management philosophy that has become trendy in recent years. Adherents believe that instead of optimizing for profit, organizations should put human emotion at the center of every strategy decision and begin by empathizing with their customers. \u201cNo technology ever evolves without the human interpreting and altering it,\u201d Hackett says. \u201cEvery new technology, the science and the engineering of it, has to give way to human understanding and use.\u201dHackett is only six months into the chief-executive job, but his mannerisms have already entered Ford\u2019s bloodstream. I arrived in Dearborn expecting to talk about drivetrains and crankshafts, but in a series of interviews with nearly a dozen executives, barely anyone mentioned cars or trucks at all. Instead, I heard the Ford Motor Company described as a \u201cmobility solutions provider\u201d that engages in \u201cmultimodal journey planning.\u201d People spoke about \u201cwhiteboarding\u201d and \u201cblue-skying\u201d big ideas. I watched a video that described Ford\u2019s efforts to build a \u201cholistic, organic, interconnected system powered by a transportation operating system.\u201dIt is bizarre to watch an all-American manufacturing company get brain-snatched like this. Even the company\u2019s new internal mission statement bears Hackett\u2019s woolly imprint: \u201cTo become the world\u2019s most trusted mobility company by designing smart vehicles for a smart world.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly \u201cBuilt Ford Tough.\u201d But it\u2019s very much in keeping with Hackett\u2019s worldview, in which everything exists in connection with everything else, and changing one piece of a system necessarily changes the whole. A car learns to drive itself, and a city\u2019s transportation grid shifts around it.This kind of big-picture futurism is necessary in Detroit today, where automakers are frantically reinventing themselves to stay ahead of what they fear might be coming. The average personal vehicle is driven less than an hour per day. But self-driving cars can, in theory, pick up and drop off passengers all day, which significantly reduces the number of cars a community needs. (Researchers at the University of Michigan estimate that autonomous vehicles could cause car ownership to drop by as much as 43 percent. Lyft, which has a horse in the race, cites research estimating that as many as 80 percent of cars could eventually be eliminated.) And because much of the value of self-driving cars lies in the software that runs them, companies that make only hardware \u2014 known in the business as \u201coriginal equipment manufacturers,\u201d or O.E.M.s \u2014 are likely to be squeezed, or worse.Faced with visions of a bleak future as low-margin widget-builders for Silicon Valley, automakers have spent the past several years trying to catch up. General Motors spent $581 million to buy Cruise Automation, a self-driving-technology start-up. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles struck a deal with Waymo, in addition to partnering with BMW and Intel. Daimler and Volvo each joined with Uber, and Toyota set up a whole research institute in Silicon Valley to build its own self-driving vehicles.Ford\u2019s plans might be the most ambitious. It wants to have a hand in every part of the self-driving-car industry, including the software that replaces the human driver, the platform that connects and controls the cars and the services that spring up around them. To that end, Ford has spent the past several years quietly snapping up tech talent. It struck a partnership with Lyft and acquired Chariot, a San Francisco-based start-up that runs group shuttles for commuters. It set up an office in Palo Alto that now has 205 employees and created Greenfield Labs, a business incubator. It invested in Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based artificial-intelligence start-up, and several other companies, including Velodyne, which makes Lidar sensors, and a connected-car software outfit called Autonomic.Most industry observers believe these are the right moves for Ford to be making. But it\u2019s still tough to reconcile today\u2019s Ford \u2014 which makes money by selling millions of combustion-engine trucks and S.U.V.s every year, along with a handful of sedans and hybrids \u2014 with the eco-tech-mobility conglomerate Hackett envisions it becoming. One lesson Hackett learned from his studies is that in order to stay competitive, businesses often have to give up the things that made them great in the first place. (He calls this the \u201cperversity law.\u201d) I asked him if this meant that Ford would need to stop manufacturing conventional, gas-powered vehicles to survive.\u201cWell, part of that statement might be right,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He clarified, sort of: \u201cI\u2019m really just trying to say the better form of problem solving is to abstract the problems.\u201dSo let\u2019s try abstracting Ford\u2019s problems, to see how they might be solved. First: Ford was born at the beginning of a now-outmoded era of industrial production, one that it arguably ushered in. Back then, companies like Ford simply manufactured goods, and customers bought them. Those transactions represented a change of ownership \u2014 a customer who bought a car from Ford was free to install 15-inch subwoofers in it, or paint it bright yellow, or use it in a demolition derby \u2014 and they were typically one-time sales. Ford\u2019s responsibility for the car, and its opportunity to make a profit, ended the minute the warranty ran out.The internet changed that, by allowing companies to wrap physical goods in digital services that can be sold again and again, at much higher margins. Instead of selling servers to corporate I.T. departments, Amazon sells them time shares on a centralized server farm; instead of buying pricey home solar panels, customers can lease them from a solar service, paying for only the power they use. Makers of thermostats, baby monitors and other household gadgets \u201cextend the value chain\u201d by charging customers a monthly fee for information about their home energy use or their babies\u2019 sleep patterns. Even the language these new enterprises use is different. Goods-based businesses spoke in terms of revenues and profits. Service-based businesses count metrics like \u201cchurn,\u201d \u201caverage revenue per user\u201d and \u201clifetime value\u201d \u2014 the total amount of money they can wring from a customer.This phenomenon \u2014 which is sometimes referred to as \u201ceverything as a service,\u201d abbreviated as XaaS and pronounced \u201czass,\u201d among the kinds of people who say these things out loud \u2014 has quietly reshaped the entire economy. Trucking companies that once bought Michelin tires now rent them through a pay-per-mile service. Airlines that buy $15 million jet engines from General Electric can subscribe to OnPoint, a \u201cpower by the hour\u201d program that includes maintenance costs and data-analysis tools. G.E. Aviation now makes the better part of its revenue from services like these.The auto industry was slow to come to grips with this new model \u2014 in part because it long ago gave away the entire service piece of its business to gas stations, body shops, Jiffy Lubes and a hundred other barnacle industries. Thanks to old and byzantine state laws, most carmakers aren\u2019t even allowed to sell or lease directly to their customers \u2014 every transaction has to go through an independent dealer. When it comes to data, automakers are flying blind. As Reilly P. Brennan, a venture capitalist who invests in self-driving technology, put it to me: \u201cThe urinal in the men\u2019s bathroom knows more about its users than most carmakers in 2017.\u201dWith self-driving cars, automakers see a chance to fix that. Ford\u2019s executives talk hopefully about one day offering their own suite of software inside their autonomous vehicles, and building interfaces that companies like Netflix and Skype could plug into. They don\u2019t see themselves usurping Silicon Valley, exactly, but they do see themselves playing in the same league. \u201cTwo to three years ago, the tech community was holding the auto industry at arm\u2019s length,\u201d said Ken Washington, Ford\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cThey thought we were sort of this curious industry that they could come into and disrupt.\u201d He went on: \u201cNow, when I go to Silicon Valley and I interact with tech companies, it\u2019s a dynamic of much more intense interest in collaborating with us.\u201dCollaboration takes many forms, of course, and not all tech companies seem interested in an equal partnership. John Krafcik, the chief executive of Waymo, told me that while traditional auto companies \u201cbring a lot to the party\u201d in terms of hardware expertise, they\u2019re not well equipped to solve the software-based problem of replacing a human driver, which requires huge teams of highly skilled engineers and tremendous amounts of technological infrastructure \u2014 the kinds of tools available to only a Google sibling company. \u201cThe self-driving aspect is really supercomplicated,\u201d Krafcik said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last nine years trying to solve that puzzle. It requires a lot of skills.\u201d It also requires focus, which is a problem for companies that still sell millions of conventional cars and trucks a year, that have thousands of employees to pay and quarterly results to deliver, that can\u2019t exactly drop everything and become software companies.In Detroit, cautious optimism prevails. But outside Detroit, there are real doubts that any auto company can transform itself quickly enough. \u201cAutonomous vehicles are not an incremental shift,\u201d said Carol Reiley, a founder of Drive.ai. \u201cIt\u2019s a very transformative shift, almost like moving from the horse and carriage to the car.\u201d Like many tech executives, Reiley saw Detroit\u2019s quest to control the self-driving-car industry as tactically sound but ultimately a long shot. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they can make it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of baggage.\u201dA week after my Detroit trip, I visited the Pittsburgh offices of Argo AI, the artificial-intelligence start-up that is creating the software brains for Ford\u2019s self-driving vehicles. Ford is investing $1 billion for a majority stake and controls two of Argo\u2019s five board seats. Which means that Argo is an independent company, but only barely \u2014 40 of its 230 employees are transfers from Ford, and Ford is its only corporate partner.Argo\u2019s headquarters is in Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District, a formerly industrial area just outside downtown that has become a center of driverless-car activity. (Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Group is down the street.) Its office is a high-ceilinged space in a modern office building with conference rooms named for famous scientists: Planck, Descartes, Hopper. When I arrived, engineers were eating catered lunch at their standing desks. Squint and ignore the smokestacks outside, and you could be in San Francisco \u2014 which is sort of the point. Ford wants Argo to look and feel like a nimble tech start-up, not a subsidiary of a century-old auto company.I was greeted by Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander, Argo AI\u2019s founders, both well-known figures in the small self-driving-car world. They had been special-faculty members at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s prestigious robotics-engineering program, and Salesky competed in the 2007 Darpa Urban Challenge, a storied self-driving-vehicle race whose alumni now populate the top ranks of the autonomous-vehicle industry. Salesky went to Google to build self-driving cars; Rander went to Uber. They quit their jobs and started Argo AI in November of last year, and in February, with no real product to speak of, and hardly any employees, they announced that they had raised huge sums of money from Ford.The day before my visit, Salesky made waves with a bombastic post on the company\u2019s blog, in which he accused the autonomous-vehicle industry of overselling its progress. \u201cThose who think fully self-driving vehicles will be ubiquitous on city streets months from now or even in a few years,\u201d he wrote, \u201care not well connected to the state of the art or committed to the safe deployment of the technology.\u201d It was a rare role reversal \u2014 the software engineer throwing up caution flags \u2014 and, perhaps, evidence that Ford is trying to stall for time. Officially, Argo is still aiming for Ford\u2019s 2021 target, but Salesky waffled on the firmness of that deadline, saying there\u2019s a chance a true Level 4 autonomous vehicle could be finished later, or possibly sooner. \u201cIt\u2019s ready when it\u2019s ready,\u201d he told me.Salesky freely admitted that he is playing catch-up. Ford won\u2019t share statistics about its self-driving test cars, but public records from California give some sense of what it\u2019s up against. Last year, Ford, which does most of its testing in Michigan and Arizona, logged just 590 autonomous miles in the state, while Waymo\u2019s vehicles logged 635,867 miles. Argo is also building its code from scratch and doesn\u2019t have access to the digital infrastructure that competitors like Waymo and Uber do. \u201cWe\u2019re not out there trying to tell everyone we\u2019re going to be first or beat X, Y or Z company,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cThe goal is to get to market with something that can scale up.\u201dIn order to work properly, a self-driving car also has to understand how humans behave. It needs to know the difference between a car that is idling in the right-hand lane (in which case the autonomous vehicle should steer around it) and one that is about to parallel park (in which case the vehicle should stay in its lane, giving the other car some room). It needs to predict that the jogger running toward the corner will stop for traffic, but that the kid running to chase a basketball might not. It needs to be able to navigate a four-way stop, which in polite parts of the country involves lots of eye contact and you-first hand gestures. \u201cThis goes beyond just seeing and understanding the world,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cIt means understanding what each of the actors in the world is going to do.\u201dIn other words, driving isn\u2019t just a mechanical task \u2014 it\u2019s a social act, and in order to coexist with human drivers, self-driving cars will need to develop a level of social awareness that approaches that of a full-fledged A.I. This is why some computer scientists think Waymo is going to be unbeatable. As an Alphabet company, Waymo has access to some of the best engineering talent in A.I., along with Google\u2019s enormous data troves and the machine-learning systems that have been trained using that data. In other words, the vast data-harvesting powers that make Google\u2019s consumer products so creepy could also make Waymo\u2019s vehicles better at navigating the physical world.But all this obsessive focus on tech elides a much more foundational question about our relationship to cars. Tech companies tend to view driving as a functional problem \u2014 get safely from Point A to Point B as quickly as possible \u2014 in which the vehicle itself is largely an extraneous variable. A car might begin its life as a Toyota or a Hyundai, but once it\u2019s autonomous and on a ride-sharing network, it\u2019s just an Uber. Silicon Valley believes that software, not hardware, is what matters to riders, and this will be especially true of self-driving cars \u2014 which, at least in early days, will most likely be shared among strangers.But Detroit has spent decades and billions of advertising dollars persuading us that its mass-produced cars are anything but homogeneous metal boxes \u2014 that they carry profound talismanic qualities that transfer to their owners. You can be an F-150 woman or a Mustang man, and those choices signal tribal affiliations that extend far past the act of driving. Ford\u2019s challenge, then, is keeping these storied brands alive for the consumers who still obsess over them, while Argo builds the software that will satisfy the car-agnostic city dwellers. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act, made even more complicated by the politics of a 114-year-old Detroit manufacturing company lashing its fate to a one-year-old Pittsburgh tech start-up, and vice versa. \u201cThey\u2019ve put a lot of trust in us,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also put a lot of trust in them.\u201dBill Ford has been working in the family business for 38 years and spent most of that time as an iconoclast. His interest in \u201csmart mobility\u201d \u2014 which amounts to an interest in reducing the number of cars on the road \u2014 was until recently considered heretical. But the past few years have vindicated his predictions. He thinks that the coming convergence of tech and transportation could turn Detroit and Silicon Valley into permanent collaborators. He started Fontinalis Partners, a venture-capital fund outside Ford, to invest in mobility start-ups, and flies regularly to San Francisco to meet with entrepreneurs working on transportation-related projects.\u201cThe narrative, probably even two years ago, would have been \u2018tech companies win, autos lose,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened, though, is there\u2019s been a realization that we have a lot more intellectual property than the world realized,\u201d by which he means celebrated lines like the F-150, along with some proprietary under-the-hood technology that I won\u2019t pretend to understand. \u201cSecond, we really know how to integrate a lot of what the tech companies have into our vehicles, and we know how to make vehicles as well.\u201dI was struck by how frequently this simple point is deployed at Ford: We know how to make stuff, and making stuff isn\u2019t easy. At first, I dismissed it as a na\u00efve attempt to steer a conversation about Detroit\u2019s shortcomings back toward its strengths. Apple taught suppliers halfway across the world how to make iPhones with micron-level precision \u2014 how hard could it be to slap some metal together and put it on wheels?But making cars isn\u2019t like making other things. It\u2019s a dizzying logistical ballet that involves heavy machinery, grueling labor and countless opportunities for error. It\u2019s wrangling union contracts while keeping the line moving. It\u2019s paying people enough to ensure that they won\u2019t miss a loose bolt and kill someone. It\u2019s designing objects that not only work well but also fill a psychological need for buyers. In the end, maybe the self-driving-car race will be decided not purely on technological achievement, but also on these much more prosaic questions \u2014 who can make good things and persuade people to use them? After all, the Model T wasn\u2019t the first car invented, or the best at the time. But it was accessible and functional and spoke to people\u2019s needs in a simple way during a time of confusing technological change. That conversation is about to begin again.Kevin Roose is a business-and-technology columnist for The Times and a writer at large for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Generation of Character Actors", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "Once strictly supporting names, these performers have now emerged as key players in a changing Hollywood.Supported by\u201cA lot,\u201d Gerry replies.\u201cTo who?\u201d Curtis asks.Gerry looks around, gestures weakly at the bar and whispers, \u201cEveryone.\u201d Mendelsohn draws out this line, cracking a proud little smile, which transforms into a nervous grimace \u2014 as if he\u2019s sharing a secret better left unsaid. It\u2019s one of the most impressive eight seconds of film acting in recent years; with a single word, an actor pulls us into his character\u2019s anguished world.All actors play characters, of course, but only some are called \u201ccharacter actors.\u201d The term is contentious \u2014 performers rarely use it to describe their peers \u2014 yet it has persisted for more than a century. It first became common in 19th-century theater criticism to discuss actors who immersed themselves fully in their roles, often using realistic makeup to become unrecognizable. By the 1930s, the term had changed in Hollywood to refer to entertainers who played specific types: Walter Brennan as the leathery old codger, Ward Bond as the avuncular authority figure. \u201cMany character actors had created their archetypes in vaudeville or theater,\u201d says Bruce Goldstein, director of repertory programming at New York\u2019s Film Forum. \u201cHollywood was turning out so many movies that character actors allowed for a kind of shorthand \u2014 you didn\u2019t need a lot of exposition. It\u2019s why films of that era are so breezy.\u201dThese men also injected a note of humanity into what would otherwise have been broad, even stock, roles. \u201cYou recognize something concrete in them,\u201d wrote the critic Gilbert Seldes in a 1934 Esquire essay, \u201cThe Itsy-Bitsy Actors.\u201d Unlike a movie\u2019s charismatic leads, character actors could be \u201crude, violent, ironic, mean, brutal and mocking. They say what the audience often feels.\u201d For this, they didn\u2019t go unnoticed \u2014 Brennan won three Best Supporting Actor Oscars from 1936 to 1940, a feat no actor has since matched. By the 1980s, the definition of a character actor again had shifted, this time to include supporting players who were familiar without being famous: people like Jon Polito, Vincent Schiavelli, Xander Berkeley. (Don\u2019t recognize their names? Google their faces.) Occasionally, if he stuck around long enough, a character actor became an institution unto himself; look no further than the tributes to Harry Dean Stanton \u2014 known for playing grizzled oddballs \u2014 when he died in September.While there are many forces behind the rise of such performers, chief among them is the implosion of Hollywood\u2019s star system over the past two decades. The unchecked increase in movie-star salaries in the 1980s and 1990s led to a reckoning throughout the 2000s, as expensive talents like Harrison Ford, Tom Cruise and Eddie Murphy released films that vastly underperformed. Even Will Smith \u2014 once considered infallible \u2014 has struggled to achieve anything approaching the box-office triumphs of his mid-\u201990s heyday. Studios didn\u2019t respond to these deficits by cutting budgets, though; instead, they pursued increasingly extravagant franchises, many of which were engineered solely to manufacture new celebrities to replace the outdated models. These films varied in quality \u2014 some were admittedly entertaining \u2014 but they were formulaic when it came to plotting and casting.There\u2019s one other reason character actors are ascendant right now: When Hollywood stopped producing scripts of real merit, veteran filmmakers and screenwriters began making \u201cprestige\u201d television, which inadvertently became a training ground for these actors, much as theater once was. \u201cI like to say that television is about character and movies are about story,\u201d says Keith Gordon, an \u201980s-era character actor who now directs television, including \u201cHomeland\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d \u201cWith a film, you ask, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen?\u2019 With a TV show, you ask, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen to this character I like?\u2019\u2009\u201d Only great actors \u2014 those like Mendelsohn, who won a Lead Actor Emmy last year for his role in Netflix\u2019s \u201cBloodline\u201d \u2014 can bring the required depth to roles that are meant to encourage binge-watching: hours, if not days, spent with a character (and a person) who must be compelling enough to sustain the audience\u2019s interest and emotional engagement.Perhaps this isn\u2019t so different from The Itsy-Bitsy Actors that Seldes eulogized almost a century ago. They, too, had the ability to break through the confines of the screen to present feelings that were recognizably human. Yet those original character actors offered a brief respite from the uniformity of Hollywood\u2019s dream machine \u2014 they supported the stars, helped them tell their stories. Today, it\u2019s the character actors who viewers remember long after the rest has faded to black. And the only thing these supporting players are supporting is the weight of the industry itself.Advertisement"}

Emerson\u2019s shares have rebounded Thursday, after initially dropping on news of the offer and now flat.Now that Emerson has raised its offer for a third time, there\u2019s a question about which other levers are available to bring Rockwell to the negotiating table.

But Charles and David Koch have been interested in media investments before, having explored a deal for the business now known as Tronc (including the L.A.

For instance, the app still opens to the phone camera, allowing users to make and share photos and videos.But the redesign otherwise moves Snapchat even further away from a traditional social media model.Material shown on the app\u2019s right side \u2014 what is now the media part \u2014 must meet content and community standards, Snap has decided, whether that material is produced by a newspaper, a television studio, the company\u2019s in-house news and stories teams or so-called influencers. All must be vetted and approved.\u201cSeparating social from media has allowed us to build the best way to communicate with friends and the best way to watch great content \u2014 while addressing many of the problems that plague the internet today,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.Philip Napoli, a professor of public policy at Duke who studies media and democracy, said that Snapchat\u2019s redesign would test people\u2019s willingness to embrace a social media app that relied more on human curators than algorithms.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there\u2019s enough of a consumer backlash to make this potentially viable, especially in light of the last year,\u201d Professor Napoli said.Snap said it was using a kind of artificial intelligence known as machine learning to understand what people like to see, based on their activity, and planned to offer them new content in line with those preferences.There are limits to the amount of personalization that Snapchat will provide. In an approach similar to how Netflix widely promotes some television shows and movies, Snap will continue to promote some material \u2014 including breaking news, a new video series or a popular sporting event \u2014 to all of its users.Human curators will also program content to make sure that users\u2019 preferences are not keeping them from seeing a wide array of opinions and ideas, the company said. In addition to winnowing out fake news, this may keep Snapchat from becoming a place that reinforces narrow sets of thinking.Advertisement"}

To avoid the sidelong glances or adulation of strangers, he and his wife, Grace Ng, a homemaker, no longer say their son\u2019s name in public, even when speaking about him with each other.Mr. Wong, who identifies as a devout Christian, said the worst kind of attention came from fellow believers. \u201cThe greatest pressure has come from Christians who out of nowhere offered to pray for my son to \u2018repent of his sin,\u2019\u201d he said, adding that such remarks came from friends dear to him.He said he supports his son\u2019s pro-democracy activism, saying Joshua Wong learned his sense of mission from his religious upbringing.In fact, Mr. Wong said, his son was once an outspoken Christian, too, but now keeps his religious views out of the public eye. And differences over the role of faith in public policy have become a source of tension between them.Even now, the feelings may be a bit raw. Asked about their dispute, Mr. Wong threatened to cut short the interview.He prefers to talk about another moment. After his son kissed him and his wife goodbye, he apologized. \u201cI am sorry that I put so much pressure on you,\u201d Mr. Wong recalled his son saying.Helen Ngai had different hopes for her son, Alex Chow. Having helped build a prospering family business, she wanted her children to enjoy a life of comfort and status. She urged Alex Chow, the older of her two sons, to become a university professor.This fall, he was supposed to go to the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue a doctorate in geography.Instead, he went to prison.\u201cI wish my son had not taken this path,\u201d Ms. Ngai, 58, said in an interview in a stylishly furnished apartment in Hong Kong, one of many properties that she and her husband own around the world, including in Queens.\u201cI\u2019m just a selfish person. All I care about is making money,\u201d she said. \u201cMany in Hong Kong are selfish people. Why do so much for them?\u201dShe said she was puzzled when her son volunteered in high school to counsel underperforming students. She could not understand the guilt that he confessed to her over living in a big apartment. She ridiculed him for considering a job at Greenpeace that would have paid $38,000 per year.\u201cIs that even enough for food and housing?\u201d she recalled challenging him.\u201cI always tell my son, we must not oppose the country or the party because, at the end of the day, we are Chinese people,\u201d Ms. Ngai said.She and her husband are the sort of success story that has helped make Hong Kong one of the world\u2019s wealthiest cities. Their garment business has factories across South Asia. The two travel so often that Ms. Ngai said her son was essentially \u201craised by maids.\u201dMs. Ngai also cashed in on Hong Kong\u2019s supercharged housing market, flipping apartments for profits. This put her at odds with her son, who accused her of driving up rents for working families.\u201cIt\u2019s selfish people like you who are holding back society,\u201d she recalled her son accusing her.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t, would you have such a big apartment?\u201d Ms. Ngai retorted.\u201cI would rather live in subsidized housing,\u201d her son replied.\u201cWe never had to worry too much about money,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why for him it\u2019s all about justice and other people\u2019s misfortunes.\u201dThe first time she visited her son in prison, she cried so hard she could hardly speak. In an attempt to cheer her up, Alex Chow said prison had given him a new cause: advocating better conditions for inmates and prison employees.\u201cI told him not to meddle in other people\u2019s affairs,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he said that what is wrong must be set right.\u201dShe thought her son, Nathan Law, then 21, was back in his college dormitory.She was stunned when someone switched on a television, and there he was rallying demonstrators.\u201cI knew he was in big trouble the moment he picked up the microphone,\u201d said Ms. Lam, who had warned her son against getting involved in politics. \u201cThey always go for the leaders.\u201dMs. Lam, 55, said she just wanted Mr. Law to focus on his studies. Born poor in China\u2019s southeastern province of Guangdong, she had moved to Hong Kong with her three sons in 1999 in hopes of providing them a better life. She raised them almost entirely as a single mother, living in public housing and working as a janitor and in other jobs to put her sons through school.She divorced her husband when Mr. Law, the youngest, was still in high school. In an interview, he described his upbringing as \u201cworking class.\u201dDespite that, she said she always tried to give her sons a lot of freedom.\u201cMy only expectations are that he studies, doesn\u2019t do heroin or gamble \u2014 the minimum requirements,\u201d she said.However, she said she objected when she first learned that Mr. Law had become a leader of a pro-democracy group at his university.\u201cI just wanted stability,\u201d she said.\u201cIf everyone is selfish, society will not change,\u201d she recalled her son responding.She said she had another reason for feeling dread. Growing up in China, she had seen the political violence of the Cultural Revolution. She feared that challenging power would only bring retribution.On the first night of the Umbrella Revolution, she said she huddled in a hotel room with relatives, worried sick.\u201cHe\u2019s young. He\u2019s inexperienced. He has not been through the kind of purge that happened on the mainland,\u201d Ms. Lam said.Now, she said, her fears have been borne out.\u201cHe said, \u2018Hong Kong wasn\u2019t like the mainland.\u2019 And I said, \u2018You\u2019ll see. I\u2019m worried for you even if you\u2019re not,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lam recalled. \u201cNow it\u2019s all happened.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disney Said to Have Held Talks to Acquire 21st Century Fox Assets", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Walt Disney Company recently held preliminary talks to buy entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the Fox movie and television studio, the FX cable network and a share of Hulu.The talks were first reported by CNBC on Monday and confirmed by two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private information. The two companies are no longer talking, although discussions could restart.Spokeswomen for both companies declined to comment.The talks, however preliminary, say a lot about the rapidly evolving media industry. Big players like Disney are seeking to get bigger as they follow Netflix into the streaming business and square off against technology giants like AT&T, which is in the final stages of acquiring Time Warner. Medium-size players like 21st Century Fox may be realizing \u2014 or accepting \u2014 that gaining the scale they need to compete may be out of reach at this point.Disney shares climbed 2 percent on Monday. Disney is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.Fox shares shot up 10 percent. Fox is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\u201cWe see the real strategy here as Fox content helping Disney build out its direct-to-consumer strategy,\u201d Steven Cahall, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note.As growth in the traditional cable business slows because of cord cutting, Disney also sees value in Hulu, which focuses on programming aimed at adults, including the Emmy-winning \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d Disney owns 30 percent of Hulu now. Fox also holds a 30 percent share, with the balance owned by Comcast and Time Warner.As part of the talks, Disney also looked at buying Fox\u2019s minority stake in Sky, the Britain-based pay-television service. Fox has been trying to buy all of Sky, but has so far been stymied by regulatory approvals.For 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, such a sale would amount to an acknowledgment that it cannot compete against media colossuses like AT&T and Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal. Companies like Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google are also expanding into entertainment.Mr. Murdoch tried to buy Time Warner in 2014 for $89 billion but dropped the effort after Time Warner spurned the offer.With some of its assets sold, Fox would remain a powerful player in television news and sports, two niches that remain highly valued by advertisers. The talks with Disney did not include the sale of Fox\u2019s broadcasting network, Fox News or Fox\u2019s sports holdings.In its last fiscal year, which ended on June 30, 21st Century Fox had $28.5 billion in revenue, a 4 percent increase from a year earlier, and $2.95 billion in profit attributable to Fox shareholders, a 7 percent increase. Much of that profit came from Fox\u2019s cable television unit, of which Fox News is the largest contributor.Advertisement"}

The thick, not entirely natural-looking hair. The custom suits that nevertheless pulled and bunched across the chest and waist, when fit is supposed to be the whole point of a custom suit. The faux idea of what a master of the universe would wear. The one that equates cost and surface with value.The association makes a certain amount of sense: After all, this particular story line (antique rugs, another purchase specified in the indictment, thrown in) could have come straight from one of Mr. Spelling\u2019s productions.

About a Patek Philippe instead of a Rolex.The fact is, however, as the founder of a private equity firm said, Mr. Manafort could not really have dressed like our highfalutin\u2019 imagination might have wanted, because the cardinal rule of being part of any hierarchy is you don\u2019t dress better than the boss.

Now What Do We Do With Their Work?", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThe responses have been breathtaking in their speed and decisiveness. Another powerful man in media or entertainment is accused of being a sexual predator. He admits it, or not. He comes under investigation, or quits, or is fired. And all at once, his work \u2014 no matter how much people liked it before \u2014 turns radioactive.But as more and more once-important figures are banished from sight, at least for the time being, what should become of their work?\u201cThese are very sensitive situations that reflect what has been building up in our industry for years,\u201d Mr. Domingo said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to take a breath, assess and not respond impulsively.\u201dWeighing the worth of an accused perpetrator\u2019s film, television show or news program is nearly impossible in the context of victims\u2019 distress. It\u2019s like comparing apples with unicorns. And so it\u2019s not surprising that emotions are running high.On Tuesday, for instance, Dylan Byers, a senior reporter for media and politics at CNN, waded into a roiling sea of outrage in the usual way people do these days, on Twitter. \u201cBeyond the pain/humiliation women have endured (which is of course the paramount issue), it\u2019s worth taking stock of the incredible drain of talent from media/entertainment taking place right now. Never has so much talent left the industry all at once,\u201d he tweeted.The reaction was immediate and angry. \u201cWhat Dylan Byers meant to say\u201d is that he was disappointed \u201cthat sexual predators are finally getting punished for their actions because he really enjoys binge-watching \u2018House of Cards\u2019 and \u2018Charlie Rose\u2019 reruns,\u201d one woman wrote on Twitter.Those were generally seen as rare cases that (perhaps) could be overlooked because of the men\u2019s particular genius, or because times were different then. What has changed now is the unveiling of evidence that sexually predatory behavior is pervasive and that it has flourished in hierarchical, male-dominated industries that have at best ignored, and at worst enabled, such behavior by powerful and once-untouchable men.In the current period of reckoning, some are arguing that a wholesale expunging or erasure of work by sexual harassers is a small price to pay if it results in a thorough rethinking in creative industries, where the use of sex and power are particularly ill-defined and open to abuse.\u201cWe all have an instinct to instantly try to figure out how to redeem all these people and still be able to enjoy all this work, and it\u2019s a very selfish instinct,\u201d the producer and director Judd Apatow said. In his view, what happens to their work is \u201cthe least important question\u201d on the table.\u201cAll our energy should be with the victims,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened to them? How did people handle this? What could we do going forward to support them in a productive way?\u201dThe moves to yank television shows, to cancel future projects or \u2014 in the case of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cTransparent\u201d \u2014 to consider envisioning popular series without actors who are central to the works\u2019 success, are hardly just a matter of simple morality. In the case of those two programs, there\u2019s also the question of whether audiences would even want to watch them without Mr. Spacey and Jeffrey Tambor, their stars.And it\u2019s difficult to discern to what extent these decisions are being based on matters of principle or economics or publicity or audience interests. Many companies contacted for this article, including Sony and Netflix, refused to comment. And though Netflix continues to show old episodes of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d as well as stand-up specials by Louis C.K., another network, HBO, not only eliminated Louis C.K. from its \u201cNight of Too Many Stars\u201d comedy benefit on Nov. 18 but also removed his past work from its website.In a statement, the network explained that his comedic material too closely resembled his non-comedic actions. \u201cIn looking at previous HBO shows, we also made the decision to no longer make them available as material in them skirted uncomfortably close to his own admittedly repugnant behavior,\u201d the statement said.Some people, like the feminist scholar Camille Paglia, argue that art \u2014 no matter who created it \u2014 should be beyond the scope of punishment.\u201cThe artist as a person should certainly be subject to rebuke, censure, or penalty for unacceptable actions in the social realm,\u201d Ms. Paglia said via email. \u201cBut art, even when it addresses political issues, occupies an abstract realm beyond society.\u201d\u201cIn situations where you get these serial cases with Weinstein or Wieseltier, we\u2019re on safe ground to say, yes, we feel comfortable making the guilty charge and acting accordingly,\u201d said Ms. Kipnis, speaking of the producer Harvey Weinstein and the literary critic Leon Wieseltier, who both face multiple accusations from young women they worked with. She compared their cases to the smaller number of allegations against Mr. Tambor, the \u201cTransparent\u201d star who has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.\u201cIn cases where standards have changed because we\u2019re sensitive to things at the moment where we weren\u2019t 20 years ago, or you just have one or two accusations, you want to act carefully,\u201d Ms. Kipnis said.\u201cWhere I would draw the line might be someplace different from where someone else draws the line,\u201d she added. \u201cIf someone\u2019s an adulterer, do we pull their work? Are you going to take all of Hitchcock\u2019s films out of circulation, and those of every other person who\u2019s been accused of being a sleaze?\u201dIt\u2019s been less than two months since the cascade of harassment scandals began, and when (and if) some of the men caught up in them will ever work again is anybody\u2019s guess.But, Mr. Travers added, that might not even be the most pertinent question. \u201cA lot of people are hoping this is more of a turning point, that the work that\u2019s being lost won\u2019t be missed because the work that\u2019s being gained will be better,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who were silenced and thrown out and kept from working by these predators will be able to go forward and thrive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Relying on multiple narrators to tell a tale (as Ms. Jordan does) is a common enough novelistic technique, but movies sometimes sag under the weight of even a single voice-over. The half-dozen voices who reflect on the meaning of the onscreen action might have been distracting or confusing, but instead, remarkably enough, they provide an almost musical structure and a feeling of moral gravity. What happens is a communal tragedy, but one that is experienced differently by everyone involved.The Jacksons are African-American tenant farmers who have managed, through years of toil, to arrive at a measure of stability and the guarded hope that something better might be possible in the future. The land they work is purchased by Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke), whose agriculture and business skills fall short of his ambitions. He and his wife, Laura (Carey Mulligan), come to rely on Hap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Mary J. Blige). Henry\u2019s feckless younger brother, Jamie (Garrett Hedlund), befriends the Jacksons\u2019 oldest son, Ronsel (Jason Mitchell). Both Ronsel and Jamie are combat veterans, and their natural camaraderie breaks the rules of racial separation, particularly infuriating Jamie and Henry\u2019s father, a hateful old cur they call Pappy (Jonathan Banks).The more sympathetic members of the McAllan clan \u2014 Laura, a bookish, musical, cultivated woman dragged into the mud by the blunt force of her husband\u2019s will, and Jamie, a dissolute, poetic soul of the kind Tennessee Williams would have recognized \u2014 are in some ways more dangerous to the Jacksons. Ronsel has seen enough of the world and tasted enough freedom to find the strictures of home intolerable. His insistence on behaving like a citizen already puts him at risk: After both world wars, black veterans were frequent targets of white violence. But Jamie, in his blithe disregard for local norms, is protected in a way Ronsel is not, and his refusal to grasp that asymmetry has terrible consequences.I won\u2019t spell those out. \u201cMudbound\u201d begins with the digging of a grave and then jumps backward in time to move slowly toward the shadow of at least one death. Along the way, quite a lot happens \u2014 a bit too much, perhaps. There are subplots that might have been excised and twists that are a little too contorted. But Ms. Rees also knows that plot is not everything, and she uses Ms. Jordan\u2019s busy narrative as a trellis rather than an engine.

{"Headline": "Review: Netflix\u2019s \u2018The Punisher\u2019 Is Less Punishing Than Expected", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis iteration of Frank Castle, one of Marvel\u2019s most brutal heroes, certainly has its moments of graphic, over-the-top violence. But in the early going, at least, they\u2019re more widely spaced than you might expect for a comic-book story about a revenge-obsessed, gun-happy vigilante.New movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month. Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December.The slow boil and downcast vibe fit the skill set of its star, Jon Bernthal, who originated this version of the character in \u201cDaredevil.\u201d (Also crossing over is Deborah Ann Woll as the reporter Karen Page.) Mr. Bernthal does dour well, and he\u2019s good at befuddled reactions and cloudy, churning anger. His expressive range doesn\u2019t extend too far beyond that, but Castle doesn\u2019t require much more.In the post-rampage narrative of \u201cThe Punisher,\u201d Castle is trying to recover from double traumas: the destruction of his family, and the lingering guilt from his mission in Afghanistan. A support group for veterans figures prominently, and when Castle isn\u2019t talking about \u201cthe things we did over there,\u201d he\u2019s having recurring nightmares about his wife\u2019s death and sledgehammering walls at a construction site deep into the night, like a really depressed John Henry.The tropes of post-traumatic stress and recovery mesh with the topical elements of Mr. Lightfoot\u2019s story, which are presented with more polish than nuance. Castle\u2019s continuing struggle to decode his past \u2014 punctuated by those occasional eruptions of bone-crunching mayhem \u2014 plays out against a backdrop of enhanced interrogation, surveillance and the disaffection of embittered veterans, some of whom are eager to stage an insurrection to make America great again.The action picks up as the season progresses, but \u201cThe Punisher\u201d never quite gets in touch with the visceral roots of its material, something that all of the other Netflix-Marvel series do, no matter how much they distance themselves from their comic-book sources. It\u2019s handsomely shot (on New York City locations) and smoothly assembled, and its naturalistic, psychological, more moody than pulpy approach may work for non-comics fans who don\u2019t mind some gore with their procedural thrillers.But if you want your Frank Castle to be a single-minded avenger, heed the words of one of his fellow construction workers: \u201cHe ain\u2019t all there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "High-Profile Firings for Sexual Misdeeds", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetterTo the Editor:I would like to respond to the heartfelt question of Matt Lauer\u2019s co-host, Savannah Guthrie: \u201cHow do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly?\u201dThe fact is, we are all fallible and capable of some pretty bad behavior. If the bad behavior is big enough or public enough, it can easily come to define the totality of the wrongdoer. But we\u2019re all more than our worst moments. The tendency to continue caring for someone in spite of wrongdoing is part of the experience of being fully human. That said, the part of our humanity that seeks justice requires that the wrongdoer be held fully accountable.As we move through this wrenching period, sorting through the contradictory feelings that arise is both very difficult and very necessary.ANITA MORAN, SAN FRANCISCOTo the Editor:NBC must do some real soul-searching about how it has dealt with reports of sexual harassment by some of its male stars, not only Matt Lauer, host of \u201cToday,\u201d but before that, Donald Trump as host of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d if some reports are to be believed.It\u2019s not a stretch to suggest that if Mr. Trump were still in that job following Mr. Lauer\u2019s ouster, he, too, would have been fired.None of this is to suggest that NBC is the only media giant to put financial considerations before moral ones \u2014 see Charlie Rose at CBS and PBS, and Kevin Spacey at Netflix. But it is a sobering reminder that even the so-called keepers of the flame are far from perfect and need some serious minding themselves, perhaps now more than ever.GREG JOSEPH, SUN CITY, ARIZ.The writer is a retired TV critic.To the Editor:Sexual abuse or harassment of any kind are vile and should not be tolerated in our society. Having said that, there is a need to discuss punishments versus the severity of the accusations. If I created a scale, I would put Harvey Weinstein on one end and Garrison Keillor on the other end.However the punishments being dealt, especially because of knee-jerk reactions by organizations like HBO and Netflix, are often the same: terminations of jobs and often the person\u2019s movies or TV shows.Many other people are also being unfairly punished. Innocent people (especially lower-level employees) are being thrown out of work when shows are canceled.Here\u2019s another example. When the journalist Mark Halperin was exposed for sexual misconduct years earlier, the reaction was swift and final. NBC fired him, the publisher of his successful books on the presidential campaigns immediately canceled the upcoming book, and HBO canceled a movie to be based on the book.But what about his writing partner, John Heilemann, who did absolutely nothing wrong? He is also being punished. Why? Collateral damage. We need to bring common sense into this discussion.To the Editor:I am female and politically conservative. Charlie Rose may have been sexually obnoxious to women, but his program was one of the most culturally valuable and informative programs on television. I say put him back on the air.EDVIGA KRIEGER, LAS VEGASTo the Editor:As a society we have gone too far. While it is high time that women spoke out about the fundamental unfairness of male domination in our society, and about the totally unacceptable experiences of unwanted advances made by men \u2014 especially men in a position of power over them \u2014 we as a society are exhibiting mass hysteria. It smacks of a collective overreaction as a society, prompted by guilt for not speaking out long ago and tacitly accepting the unacceptable.The knee-jerk reaction of corporations firing their highly valued and highly respected employees for fear of public disapproval for not doing so is a clear sign of mass hysteria. The political correctness demanded by current public opinion throws out the baby with the bathwater. We don\u2019t want to go so far as to discourage any hug or embrace to show caring and warmth.PETER PAPESCH, BOSTONTo the Editor:At the risk of being seen as politically and socially incorrect, can I say that I\u2019m terrified that a lack of perspective and balance is going to leave us with a world run by the likes of Roy Moore and Donald Trump and without the poetry of Garrison Keillor and the humor of Al Franken?To the Editor:Yes, the exposure of powerful men guilty of sexual harassment is long overdue. Yes, there should be serious consequences. Yes, we must recognize the hurt of the women reporting these abuses.But so far, almost all of the men who have seen their careers go up in smoke are media heavyweights. Politicians not only keep their jobs but \u2014 like President Trump, Justice Clarence Thomas and probably Roy Moore \u2014 are elevated after exposure. Surely media men are no more deviants or sexually abusive than, say, male corporate bigwigs, yet we are not hearing much about the latter being publicly accused. Could it be that their payoffs are more secretive or their abused female employees have greater fear of their careers being ruined?It sure would be nice if abusers in all fields got equally exposed and penalized.STEVE GLAUBER, ARDSLEY-ON-HUDSON, N.Y.The writer is a former CBS News producer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Film That Pays Homage to the Bygone Era of London Couture", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCONTEMPORARY HAUTE COUTURE is often considered extravagant, sometimes superfluous and even irrelevant. It is one-of-a-kind, made-to-measure fashion pushed to its very limit; ball gowns so hefty they barely fit through doorways; unwritten price tags soaring into the six figures. Susan Sontag once defined the word \u201ccamp\u201d as \u201ca woman walking around in a dress made of three million feathers.\u201d That\u2019s bound to be haute couture.Yet in its heyday, haute couture wasn\u2019t an exorbitant luxury \u2014 it was simply the way clothes were made. The 1950s were the last decade before the arrival of designer ready-to-wear fashion, when wealthy women had their clothes custom-crafted as a matter of course. The dominant couturiers were, of course, in Paris, but every major city had its own couture industry, each with its own distinct style. Notables could rise even from the provinces: In 1917, Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga established his first haute couture house in the resort town of San Sebasti\u00e1n in Spain, close to his birthplace of Getaria (the house was named Eisa, after his mother); in the 1950s, a teenage Azzedine Ala\u00efa began his career working for couture houses in his native Tunis. And New York and London\u2019s houses evolved to (almost) rival the primacy of the French \u2014 the very idea of couture as a business was, in fact, arguably invented by the Englishmen Charles Frederick Worth in 1858.The postwar world of haute couture in London had its advantages and disadvantages. The royal court\u2019s social calendar demanded clothes possessing 19th-century levels of grandeur: Vast crinoline gowns were prerequisites for debutante and ambassadorial balls. Yet wartime restrictions on textile yardage, buttons and embroidery, along with clothing rationing \u2014 the last of which only ceased in the United Kingdom in the spring of 1949 \u2014 often stymied creative efforts. The differences between the British and French couture scenes reflected their respective origins\u2019 disparate philosophies: If Parisian couture, led by Christian Dior and his revolutionary 1947 \u201cNew Look\u201d silhouette, was on the cutting edge, London\u2019s society and its clothing was more conservative, respectable rather than radical.ALTHOUGH THEIR CREATIONS were more sedate, the idiosyncrasies of the British designers themselves were more than equal to those of their continental counterparts. Take Charles James: Arguably the most famous of the London set, he was an English-American couturier regarded as one of history\u2019s greatest (not only by journalists at the time, but by Balenciaga and Dior as well). While he was primarily based in New York, James never gave up his British citizenship and maintained salons in London\u2019s fashionable Bruton and Ryder streets in Mayfair. He was the quintessential English eccentric and a mercurial genius. In New York, he had walls of his salon painted puce to show dark clothes, and in navy to display his lighter-colored designs. He once threatened to release a jar of moths into a furrier\u2019s atelier over a business dispute. In 1939, presumably because the model employed to wear his clothes was inadequate, he wore his own ball gowns for Andrew Goodman of Bergdorf Goodman who, nevertheless, placed an order.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want this character to be \u2018The World\u2019s Greatest Designer.\u2019 If we wanted to do that we would have made the Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga story,\u201d Anderson says. Instead, the character is a work of fiction, an apparent amalgamation of numerous traits of various couturiers: Woodcock\u2019s imperious sister Cyril (played by Lesley Manville) helms the business \u2014 a nod to real-life couture counterparts in 1950s London, such as Victor Stiebel and Norman Hartnell, whose sisters managed their lines. He embroiders names and secret messages into his clothes, such as \u201cnever cursed\u201d in the hem of a wedding dress for a German princess, echoing the late Lee Alexander McQueen, who was rumored to have scrawled profanities inside the lining of a bespoke jacket for Prince Charles.But above all others, the House of Woodcock resembles that of Charles James. Even the love story, between Woodcock and Alma, a waitress he discovers and turns into his star muse, hints at James\u2019s own marriage in 1954 to Nancy Lee Gregory. She was a wealthy divorc\u00e9e from Kansas 20 years his junior transformed by James\u2019s gowns into a princess of New York high society. (The fact James was gay seemed to be a hindrance to neither.) The dresses created by Day-Lewis\u2019s character and those James was known for possess statuesque, sculpturelike qualities wherein the manipulation of fabric is paramount. James once created a dress ruched to resemble a Dal\u00ed-esque lobster at the height of 1930s Surrealism, and his later trussed abstractions of taffeta and wool recalled Constantin Brancusi\u2019s metal and stone objects. Other garments took on sharp, geometric shapes approximating trees, roses or swans. In the 1950s, a gown from James was considered as important as one by Worth a century before. It defined the wearer as an arbiter of style, wealthy (by midcentury he was the most expensive dressmaker in the world) and, most of all, patient. Like Day-Lewis\u2019s Woodcock, James, who viewed his work more as sculpture than articles of clothing, only parted with his confections when they were perfect, and he was perfectly satisfied \u2014 a reason why his clients frequently commissioned items years in advance.But the film is also, in its way, an argument for the enduring power of fantasy in fashion. \u201cI find these superstitions and traditions to be very exciting,\u201d Anderson says of the different couturiers (and their quirks) he researched for the film. \u201cThey can make for great stories, great fairy tales.\u201d And indeed, fairy tales are one of the primary reasons haute couture still exists today \u2014 wedding dresses are the most frequently ordered items in the industry, fit for a make-believe princess (or a real-life one). Now, these gowns are sewn in almost the same way they were in the 1950s, the 1850s, and even the 1750s \u2014 which makes wearing couture a bit like carrying a beautiful piece of history on one\u2019s back. And that\u2019s the reason couture and Hollywood meld so well together \u2014 both are dream factories, spinning yarns, selling fantasies. It is also why, in the age of Netflix and fast fashion, long after either\u2019s golden age, both couture and cinema continue to endure.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Culture Caught Up With Spike Lee \u2014 Now What?", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "FeatureAfter more than three decades as a provocateur, the filmmaker has returned to the movie that made him famous.Supported byAs I was preparing to visit him there this summer, Lee warned me that the second week of August is when \u201ceverybody\u201d descends on the Vineyard. He did not lie. The annual African-American Film Festival was happening, and the sheer saturation of black achievement on display \u2014 on an 87-square-mile strip of land that is home to some of the first integrated beaches in the country and also synonymous with the liliest-lily-white establishment \u2014 was something to behold. In the previous 24 hours, both Barack Obama and the two-time N.B.A. champion Ray Allen had teed off behind Lee\u2019s house; as my Uber turned down Lee\u2019s dirt driveway, Henry Louis Gates Jr. pedaled past on a tricycle. Lee has long been a fixture at the festival, and this year he would be previewing his latest project, a 10-episode Netflix reboot of the very film that made him a star: \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d A late-career foray into prestige television, the series, released this week, marks a homecoming of sorts, as well as a risky departure.My driver, an amiable 6-foot-8 Jamaican man who grew up in Canarsie, became star-struck when Lee came to meet our car and did not want to pull away. \u201cWhat high school you go to?\u201d Lee asked him by way of greeting. Schools and sports teams are the kinds of affiliations that genuinely mean a lot to him. The driver\u2019s answer seemed satisfactory, but then Lee noticed his backward baseball cap and asked to see the front of it. The driver sheepishly swiveled it around. \u201cIt\u2019s a B for Brooklyn,\u201d he tried.Lee was dressed more or less as himself, with a white Yankees cap, blue plastic frames and a diamond stud gleaming in his left earlobe. He had draped bright blue-and-orange plastic necklaces and two long gold chains suspending a chunky crucifix over a dark blue Yankees jersey. He also had on Knicks-colored Nikes, a Knicks-colored G-Shock watch, numerous matching blue-and-orange plastic bracelets and a beautiful one made out of solid gold. The sheer quantity of flair on his person was Pharaonic.He led me to the wraparound porch off the main house, to a white table with his papers spread on it. When he had checked and silenced his BlackBerry \u2014 he still uses one \u2014 I brought up Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s latest movie, \u201cDetroit,\u201d which opened the African-American Film Festival two days earlier. The film, about the violence inflicted by white police officers on black residents of Detroit during the 1967 riots, had upset audiences. Many black critics, and some white ones, had been making the case that it wasn\u2019t Bigelow\u2019s right as a white person to tell such a story in the first place \u2014 that her lingering and detailed depiction of the violence took on the qualities of pornography. I asked Lee if he agreed with that assessment.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d Lee said. \u201cShe\u2019s a very good director. She knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d He thought for a moment, then added: \u201cBut I do understand the flip side. Black folks get kind of funny now with other people telling our stories.\u201d Lee himself has long been one of the most outspoken critics of such work. He has famously feuded with Quentin Tarantino over what he views as Tarantino\u2019s appropriation and exploitation of blackness, particularly in \u201cDjango Unchained.\u201d \u201cAmerican Slavery Was Not a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western,\u201d Lee wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt Was a Holocaust.\u201d And he wrested \u201cMalcolm X\u201d away from the director Norman Jewison on the grounds, according to Jewison, that he lacked \u201cthe deep understanding of the black psyche\u201d required to handle the subject. Sitting on his porch, Lee lifted his cap and ran a hand across his freshly buzzed scalp. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a clich\u00e9,\u201d he said, laughing, \u201cbut people are kind of woke.\u201dIn such a context, Lee\u2019s decision to remake \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d can seem like an advertisement for himself, a savvy, scripted campaign to remind a viewing public with a very short attention span just who was here first. But for someone who has cut against the grain for so long and from so many angles, this return to the beginning can also look like a tacit concession that one of America\u2019s sharpest, most provocative personalities may have finally run out of grain to cut against.But those victories didn\u2019t amount to much, in Lee\u2019s estimation. The journalist, Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, grew increasingly despondent. \u201cWhy should I have expected more than any other white interviewer has elicited from this 35-year-old producer, writer, director and world-class hustler who courts the media and simultaneously repels inquiry with set speeches, set postures, attitude? Why should I have entertained the hope that we could leap over the dividing wall of color?\u201dOne of the most striking aspects of reading the article in 2017 is Harrison\u2019s reaction, not Lee\u2019s statements. What he says, from our current vantage, seems unexceptional \u2014 talking like that about race has practically become an orthodoxy. And this is one of the more intriguing challenges Lee, who recently turned 60, will be facing with \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d In terms of the racial politics of the day, he is more in tune than ever with mainstream liberal thought. In terms of sexual politics, however, to borrow Lee\u2019s own phrasing, women are also getting kind of funny about other people telling their stories. And younger female auteurs like Issa Rae and Lena Dunham have seized the means of narrative production, portraying female sexuality and desire in ever more urgent and original ways.What Harrison missed about her subject is that Lee has never been anything other than a first-rate color-line traverser. Born Shelton Lee in 1957 in Atlanta, the eldest of six, he moved with his family to Brooklyn when he was small. The Lees became the first black family to integrate Cobble Hill, a heavily Italian-American neighborhood near the waterfront. \u201cWe got called nigger this and nigger that,\u201d he said with a shrug, when I asked what that was like. Once his new neighbors discerned that there were no more black families following his, they seemed to relax. From that point on, Lee \u2014 whose mother, Jacquelyn, had taken to calling Spike because he was \u201ca tough baby\u201d \u2014 made friends mostly with white kids. \u201cBut my mother was a visionary,\u201d he said, so his parents saved and bought a brownstone facing the park in Fort Greene, which was then all black, \u201cfor like $45,000.\u201d (Houses on that street now routinely top $3 million.) Jacquelyn died from cancer in 1976 and never saw her son\u2019s success. His father, Bill, remarried a Lithuanian-American Jew with dreadlocks who referred to herself as \u201cspiritually black.\u201d Bill still lives in that same brownstone.Lee descends, as he puts it, \u201cfrom a long line of educated Negroes.\u201d After graduating from John Dewey High School in 1975, he went to Morehouse College, just as his father and grandfather did. His mother went to Spelman, and so did her mother, Zimmie Shelton, the granddaughter of a slave, who went on to teach art, and, Lee says, \u201csaved the Social Security checks\u201d so that she was able to put him through both college and N.Y.U. film school, where his contemporaries included Jim Jarmusch and Ang Lee. Today he is the artistic director of N.Y.U.\u2019s graduate film program.Claude Grunitzky, an entrepreneur and the founder of the pioneering urban-culture magazine Trace, has known Lee and collaborated on commercial and editorial projects with him since the \u201990s. He explained to me that Lee was always aware of his own value, and that as a result, he made significantly more money from his films than a typical independent director. Because he owns 40 Acres, Grunitzky said, \u201che can find a way to pay himself as opposed to being victim to a Hollywood studio.\u201d I asked Grunitzky why everybody doesn\u2019t do that, and his response was simple: \u201cVery few people can get away with it.\u201d Lee\u2019s near-solitary status as a black auteur for much of his career allowed him to find financing in unconventional places. When, for example, Warner Brothers balked at putting up the money to produce the version of \u201cMalcolm X\u201d Lee wanted to make, he was able to circumvent the studio and petition the most prominent members of the black 1 percent, including Magic Johnson, Oprah Winfrey and Bill Cosby, to open their pocketbooks.Lee also brought in lucrative advertising deals through his company Spike DDB. The eight black-and-white Air Jordan commercials he directed for Nike in the early \u201990s \u2014 and in which he co-starred as his character Mars Blackmon \u2014 were nearly as pivotal in embedding the product within the culture as the young M.V.P.\u2019s offense. (To this day, Nike continues to make a highly coveted riff on the sneaker called the Spizike.) In \u201cThe Spike Lee Reader,\u201d the film scholar Paula J. Massood noted that \u201cLee\u2019s production and advertising companies (the latter in particular) provide the financial foundations\u201d for him to pursue deeply original work without caving to market imperatives. Selling out, in other words, to avoid selling out.Yet despite having cracked the code of how to be a well-compensated artist \u2014 one whose beak, in real terms, is practically soaking \u2014 Lee is resistant to being thought of as wealthy. Whenever the conversation turns to money, he tends to compare himself not with everyday Americans \u2014 let alone black people \u2014 or even with other artists, but with billionaire moguls. \u201cI didn\u2019t make as much as Spielberg or Lucas, you know,\u201d he told me. In 2008, he told The New Yorker that he was \u201cnot rich rich.\u201d He went on: \u201cRich is Spielberg. Lucas. Gates. Steve Jobs. Jay-Z! Bruce Springsteen. I\u2019m not complaining. But that\u2019s money. Will Smith. Tyler Perry. Oprah Winfrey \u2014 that\u2019s a ton of money. Compared to them, I\u2019m on welfare!\u201dIt\u2019s an almost ludicrously self-indulgent way of interpreting gradations of hyperaffluence, but I could also see Lee\u2019s point. It was Lee who discovered and first cast Halle Berry. It is Lee whose homes are filled with signed photos saying \u201cthank you\u201d from Michael Jordan. It was Lee who was the first in the hip-hop era to aestheticize both the black college milieu that Kanye West used as a launchpad as well as the brownstone Brooklyn landscape that anticipated the borough\u2019s 21st-century renaissance. All of which is why it may be incongruous, yet on some level not outlandish, to think of Spike Lee as still not having gotten his full due.\u201cHe basically cashed in all the good will he had from \u2018Inside Man\u2019 to raise funds for \u2018Miracle at St. Anna,\u2019\u2009\u201d said James McBride, the National Book Award-winning author of the novel from which the script, about a real-life all-black regiment in Italy during World War II, was adapted in 2008. It, too, was a commercial failure. \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma of a talented black artist in any field,\u201d McBride told me. \u201cYou have to recreate the genre, otherwise you don\u2019t survive. Stevie Wonder is not a pop musician; Stevie Wonder is a genre. Michael Jackson is a genre to himself. Spike Lee has moved into that territory. Spike Lee is not short on talent. What Spike Lee is short on is friends in the industry, and the kind of space to fail. He has no room to fail.\u201d Rosie Perez, a longtime collaborator of Lee\u2019s, echoed McBride\u2019s sentiments over the phone. \u201cFor someone of Spike\u2019s stature to have to extend himself the way he has to to get something done is just insulting,\u201d she told me, growing emotional as she spoke.These observations about the specific plight of the black genius \u2014 that lack of margin for error \u2014 called to mind something the comedian Chris Rock has said: True equality would look less like a black president than like a black Sarah Palin. In culture as in politics, while many profess to value diversity, there remains scant space for a thriving black \u201cmiddle class\u201d within the industry, a healthy ecosystem of artists and others working at varying levels of talent and acclaim. (In a 2016 Annenberg survey of Hollywood directors, 87 percent of respondents were white.) This winner-takes-all system has led to some magnificent black art in recent years, from Barry Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMoonlight\u201d to Donald Glover\u2019s \u201cAtlanta\u201d to Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out.\u201d But such breakthroughs can be counted on five fingers at best.As Lee sees it, the solution to the problem will not come from the artists themselves. \u201cEven now with \u2018She\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u2019\u2009\u201d Lee said to me on his porch, \u201cmany people had passed on it. The reason it got made was because Netflix has three black women executives \u2014 Pauline Fischer, Tara Duncan and Layne Eskridge \u2014 who knew the cultural significance of Nola Darling and Mars Blackmon. Other people didn\u2019t get it.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think all the others passed?\u201d I asked.\u201cEvery time someone says no, they never tell you why, they\u2019re very polite. They\u2019re not going to say, \u2018This sucks,\u2019 because they don\u2019t want to burn a bridge, and they want you to come with the next thing.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut all the people who said no \u2014 there was no black person in the room with them!\u201dThree decades into his career, Lee\u2019s singular achievement seems to have led him to the realization that he cannot, in fact, do it alone. Making a Hollywood with more diverse gatekeepers is an issue of such importance to him that he says it would be worth giving back his Oscar \u2014 a point he made to me emphatically and repeatedly. But it\u2019s not just a matter of fairness. He sees it as an issue of practical importance, and in the service of this point, he brought up the excruciating Pepsi ad from this spring. In it, Kendall Jenner wanders off a fashion shoot into something like a Black Lives Matter protest and hands a can of soda to a cop, bringing joy to all, police officers and demonstrators alike. \u201cIf there were just somebody advising the room with any common sense,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cLike, \u2018Yo! My man \u2014 that [expletive] is [expletive] up!\u2019\u2009\u201d He grew serious again. \u201cGetting those gatekeeping positions. That\u2019s the last \u2014 that\u2019s where the battle is.\u201d\u201cTwenty-seven world championships! Thank you!\u201d Lee shot back without missing a beat or betraying the least bit of surprise to be addressed so familiarly by a perfect stranger.Lee pushed ahead in his customary, slightly pigeon-toed gait, torso tipped forward, necklaces swinging from his neck. I told him that I recently rewatched \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d and was astounded by the degree to which it felt au courant and even prescient. The scene late in the film when an N.Y.P.D. officer places Radio Raheem in an illegal chokehold, killing him, was shattering to watch, melding in my mind with phone-camera footage of Eric Garner, who was killed in 2014 on Staten Island in similar fashion. And the question at the heart of the drama \u2014 just whose vision of black life can (or should) prevail, anyway, Malcolm\u2019s or Martin\u2019s \u2014 was trenchant. Lee\u2019s own views on that question remain satisfyingly ambiguous. While the film seems to imply that it is Malcolm who personifies genuine integrity, Lee has also observed that Radio Raheem could have behaved differently and avoided his violent fate.Yet the film amounts to much more than mere social commentary: Like \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d and \u201cSchool Daze\u201d before it, it was itself an engine of culture. And in addition to Samuel L. Jackson, it gave us our first glimpses of Rosie Perez, Giancarlo Esposito (\u201cBefore he was Gus in \u2018Breaking Bad,\u2019 the culture knew him as Buggin\u2019 Out,\u201d Lee reminded me) and a fresh-faced Martin Lawrence. It caused a sensation at Cannes, but back home, critics including Stanley Crouch and Joe Klein worried that it would start riots. It is mind-blowing to pause and think that a film as forward-facing and potent as \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d was released the same year as \u201cDriving Ms. Daisy.\u201d \u201cDriving Ms. [expletive] Daisy.\u201d Lee shook his head. \u201cThe best film of the year 1989, brought to you by your Academy members.\u201dAs we walked on, Lee seemed to grow weary of talking. The afternoon heat was fatiguing, and we got turned around and lost in a dirt-road labyrinth along the golf course, doubling back on ourselves until we came to a cafe in a clearing, where two beautiful black women, who looked as if the universe itself belonged to them, were facing the course, sipping ros\u00e9 of the hue the French call gray.\u201cOh, [expletive], there\u2019s my wife,\u201d Lee exclaimed, leading me over to Tonya Lewis Lee, a statuesque, green-eyed blonde whose hair was sheared shorter on the sides than on top. She glanced questioningly at her husband and then extended her hand.\u201cI did not tell Spike I was going to be here.\u201d\u201cHe just slipped a LoJack in your bag,\u201d her friend Crystal said, laughing.Tonya is an attorney and an entertainment-industry force in her own right. She is the executive producer of the new \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d the impetus for which she describes as twofold: a chance for the two of them to work together and to present as fresh a vision of contemporary Brooklyn as Lee first did in the \u201980s. \u201cIt was her idea,\u201d Lee acknowledged. \u201cI did not see it.\u201dI asked her what it\u2019s like to work with her husband.\u201cBeing married to Spike is crazy every day,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cWorking with him, it\u2019s like: \u2018We\u2019re going to do it the way I do it, because, by the way, have you seen my r\u00e9sum\u00e9? Do you need my bio? Here\u2019s my bio \u2014 I\u2019ve done 30 films in 30 years.\u2019 You know, and that\u2019s how it goes.\u201dLee stood off to the side staring into the distance, a slightly amused expression playing on his face, and did not contradict her.The film tells the story of one Nola Darling, a 20-something with a spacious loft in Brooklyn and lots of scented candles, who is basking in her youth and in the world\u2019s reaction. Played by Tracy Camilla Johns, she is pursued by men and women alike, unashamedly enjoys sex and has it regularly with a persistent square named Jaime Overstreet, a ludicrous B-boy named Mars Blackmon \u2014 played by Lee \u2014 and an equally preposterous, self-obsessed male model called Greer Childs. All of the men are in possession of more resonant personalities than Nola, who is something of a cipher. In the film\u2019s denouement, an act of consensual sex turns so ugly so fast it can be described only as a rape, and it is difficult to stomach, though Nola herself seems to take the brutality in stride and even suggests that she deserved it. More shocking, the scene functions as a moment of epiphany through which her character is able to develop into a better, more stable person. By the end of the story, she has decided to commit herself to the very man who violated her.In a scathing essay titled \u201cWhose Pussy Is This: A Feminist Comment,\u201d the scholar Bell Hooks described Lee\u2019s protagonist as \u201c\u2009\u2018pure pussy,\u2019 that is to say that her ability to perform sexually is the central, defining aspect of her identity.\u201d The film, in Hooks\u2019s view, was contaminated by \u201cthe pervasive sense that we have witnessed a woman being disempowered and not a woman coming to power.\u201d Lee seems as close to chastened as possible by the criticism, and emphasized to me that five writers on the Netflix reboot are women. That is either an overdue development or an earnest act of penance or both. Yet as I compared Lee\u2019s original creation with the Netflix series, the effort to atone for that rape scene \u2014 and all the other ambiguous attitudes it rendered explicit \u2014 felt forced, even conformist. And such lack of edge is compounded by society\u2019s shifting sexual mores: \u201cEverybody\u2019s got three lovers now,\u201d Samuel L. Jackson, another longtime collaborator of his, told me skeptically. \u201cThat\u2019s not controversial, that\u2019s kind of normal.\u201dFor these and other reasons, the series can seem a lot less interested in eros than ideology, functioning as a platform to disseminate right-thinking messages about black culture and beauty standards, misogyny, homophobia, mental illness and policing. Toward the end of the first episode, a millennial Nola Darling, played by DeWanda Wise, turns straight into the camera and declares out of nowhere that \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d It\u2019s a move so timely and didactically on the nose that it permanently ripped me out of the fictive dream. And ever since then, I have thought of that scene more than any other, and of its meaning for the project as an artistic endeavor.I could not shake the suspicion, watching \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d that Lee made better, more bracing work in the era in which he was more conscious and more irreverent than the culture at large \u2014 a time when he found himself freer to enlighten as well as offend. The shift seemed to come somewhere around 2015\u2019s \u201cChi-Raq,\u201d a surreal spin on Aristophanes\u2019 play about the Peloponnesian War, updated to take on the fraught subject of homicide in Chicago. In the movie, as in the play that inspired it, women impose a sex strike to pressure their men into a cease-fire. Critics liked it. Yet before it was even released, the film was consumed by controversy over the title and by concerns over whether the city\u2019s miseries should even be appropriated for cinematic purposes \u2014 let alone for ones with a self-critical bent.Skeptics took issue with Lee\u2019s intentionally fantastical plot, calling it glib and insensitive. \u201c\u2009\u2018Chi-Raq\u2019 leans heavily on the not-at-all-modern but seductive power of enduring sexual stereotypes ... to sell a sexual strike as a viable solution to Chicago\u2019s staggering murder rate,\u201d Janell Ross wrote in The Washington Post. \u201cIt puts us in the zone of facile, no-cost, no-government-or-public-\u200bengagement-needed solutions to a big and complicated problem.\u201d Representatives of the local hip-hop scene bristled at the notion of an outsider telling their story, from Chief Keef\u2019s manager to the Grammy winner Chance the Rapper, who released a blistering fusillade of tweets deeming the film both \u201csexist\u201d and \u201cracist.\u201d Lee responded by calling the rapper a \u201cfraud.\u201d\u201cBlack Twitter is a [expletive], I\u2019m telling you,\u201d Lee said, shaking his head over the outcry that met his film on social media. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a force to be reckoned with.\u201d Perhaps that is why, at the time of the movie\u2019s release, he, too, began to justify himself not in strictly artistic terms but in primarily social ones: He told reporters that he wanted to save lives. As we spoke on his porch, he circled back several times to the Windy City\u2019s mortality crisis, each pass growing more and more agitated. Finally, he began to sketch in his notebook a series of circles representing homicide rates in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles for 2016, the first one dwarfing the others.At that moment, Lee\u2019s balancing act \u2014 as both representative and critic of black America \u2014 seemed simultaneously inescapable and overwhelming to me. I began to suspect it might seem that way to him as well.The following night, I accompanied Lee to his screening of a Netflix one-off called \u201cRodney King,\u201d a film he made of an ingenious one-man show about Los Angeles in the \u201990s \u2014 but really about America today \u2014 written and performed by Roger Guenveur Smith, another of his longtime collaborators. Lee wore a denim jacket that had Esposito\u2019s face as Buggin\u2019 Out airbrushed on the back of it. He does not even try to blend into crowds, and before we could get inside the building, he posed for a dozen pictures. A retired black physician pitched him a movie project about a retired black physician on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Lee politely declined.Inside, the auditorium of the local high school was bustling. Branford Marsalis and Junot D\u00edaz were milling about, as was Guenveur Smith. For an hour onscreen, his sweaty, wide-eyed face held the room rapt. The performance was so sui generis and captivating, Lee didn\u2019t have to do anything but set up cameras at a variety of angles and record it. Yet it is precisely the kind of offbeat, hallucinatory and essential project that also requires a deeply attuned but independent force to bring about.Two nights later, Lee closed the festival with a screening of a teaser for \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d \u2014 again at the high school in front of another packed house. It was Saturday, Aug. 12, the afternoon when white nationalists brought death to the streets of Charlottesville, Va. In the taxi, Lee had mentioned that he spoke to Obama earlier in the day, when he reached the 18th hole, behind Lee\u2019s house. Obama hadn\u2019t yet heard about what was happening because he\u2019d been out on the course all day. Somehow that image struck me as unbearably sad. Perhaps it struck Lee that way, too, and we quickly changed the subject.One of the things you hear over and over again about Lee is how loyal and generous he is in a business that is so often the opposite. He employs countless graduates of historically black colleges and universities in front of and especially behind the cameras, and many of them were at the screening, as well as hundreds of black Vineyard locals who had no particular connection but simply seemed grateful to be among the first to support one of their own, that rare voice who tells stories specifically for and about them. Lee calls black audiences like this his \u201cbase,\u201d and he told me that he always tests out his work in front of them first because they\u2019ll let you know \u201cif this some [expletive].\u201d He has cut scenes in the past after such encounters, including one from \u201cJungle Fever\u201d that Wesley Snipes advised him never to show. The base, that night, erupted in applause. I wondered if my initial misgivings had been too harsh.The poet Amiri Baraka once derisively wrote that Lee was \u201cthe quintessential buppie,\u201d his work frivolous and bourgeois, but that is vicious. The Rev. Michael L. Pfleger, the real-life Chicago preacher behind John Cusack\u2019s character in \u201cChi-Raq,\u201d described him as \u201cthe conscience of Hollywood,\u201d but that may be too generous. Roger Ebert, who recalled having been \u201ctoo shaken to speak\u201d after seeing \u201cDo the Right Thing,\u201d got the closest to the truth when he wrote about the fundamental \u201cevenhandedness that is at the center of Spike Lee\u2019s work,\u201d a quality that is sadly \u201cinvisible to many of his viewers and critics.\u201d It is this evenhandedness that causes some whites to recoil from him as angry, while at the very same time it makes some blacks cool to him as out of touch. It may be the most important, but by no means only, part of what makes him a genuine and lasting artist.The day after the festival ended, I met Lee at the 40 Acres and a Mule headquarters on South Elliott Place in Fort Greene, around the corner and down the block from where he grew up. It is a museum-like world unto itself that stretches over four floors all bursting with memorabilia, art, antique racial propaganda and movie posters with fond inscriptions from peers like Spielberg and Fellini. The outside of the building has always functioned as a way for Lee to communicate with the neighborhood directly. On that day, it was adorned with large, bright purple posters for the new \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d As he was locking up, three young black women approached him, took photos and thanked him for his work. He was still wearing the denim jacket with Esposito\u2019s face on it (and for good measure, carrying an orange backpack adorned with his own likeness as Mars Blackmon). As he walked me across Lafayette Avenue and down Fulton, cars honked and strangers waved. Lee acknowledged all of them.We had come to South Portland Avenue, where the local rap legend Notorious B.I.G. has for years now been reduced to a child-friendly caricature emblazoned on the side of an open-air Mexican-Cuban eco-cafe. \u201cBrooklyn is gentrified!\u201d Lee laughed, gesturing at all the new construction rising up around us. It is, and it has been for a long time now. Lee has solidified his own sort of landmarked status as a local and national treasure. But on that hot summer day, as we said goodbye and I watched him turn and walk away into that sanitized, rainbow-colored bobo wonderland, for the first time since I\u2019d met him he seemed almost out of place.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the 1963 church bombing that was the subject of Spike Lee\u2019s movie \u201c4 Little Girls.\u201d The bombing occurred at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., not in Little Rock, Ark.Thomas Chatterton Williams is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Magic and Moral of Joan Didion", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI blame my flickering attention, but I have always gone as gaga for isolated sentences as for whole books. One favorite begins an essay that I\u2019ve read 20-odd times over 30-plus years, and it\u2019s this: \u201cOnce, in a dry season, I wrote in large letters across two pages of a notebook that innocence ends when one is stripped of the delusion that one likes oneself.\u201dIt plants a provocative idea \u2014 that abasement is the gateway to adulthood. But what really gets me is the order of the words, the clustering of all those prepositional phrases near the start. I was in college when I first read it, and I thought to myself that a dour composition instructor would take out a red pen and flag the meandering path from \u201cwrote\u201d to \u201cthat.\u201dI also thought that the sentence was perfect. Its detour was its music. And that music had a deliberately overwrought quality, signaling the author\u2019s self-consciousness. \u201cLarge letters.\u201d \u201cTwo pages.\u201d This was someone taking herself very seriously \u2014 and wholly, endearingly aware of that.Syntax and sensibility: Nobody wed them quite like Joan Didion, the author of that essay, \u201cOn Self-Respect,\u201d and many others. She\u2019s the subject of a new documentary, \u201cJoan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold,\u201d which reveals that in the 1960s, when she worked at Vogue, the magazine\u2019s editors committed to a reflection on self-respect before bothering to figure out who would fashion it. Only later did they settle on Didion, then in her 20s. She cooked it to order, and nonetheless came up with what is rightly considered one of her masterpieces.\u201cThe Center Will Not Hold\u201d is no masterpiece. But it\u2019s fascinating, in part because of scattered tidbits like that. Directed by Griffin Dunne, her nephew, who includes footage from his recent interviews with her, it shows that despite her cultivated image as a nervous waif at the mercy of moods and the Santa Ana wind, she could be ruthlessly practical and utterly unsentimental.Dunne asks her how she felt when, in the course of reporting an article about the San Francisco counterculture, she came across a 5-year-old on L.S.D. \u201cIt was gold,\u201d she tells him. \u201cYou live for moments like that.\u201dShe was married for nearly 40 years to an uncle of his, the writer John Gregory Dunne, whose death in 2003 prompted her exquisite memoir \u201cThe Year of Magical Thinking.\u201d Griffin asks if he was put off decades earlier by her frank essay about trouble in their marriage.\u201cHe edited that,\u201d she answers, explaining that, as writers, they both understood that \u201cyou used your material.\u201d\u201cYou wrote what you had,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that was what I happened to have at the moment.\u201dThe couple collaborated on screenplays. Warren Beatty dropped by their Malibu beach house and flirted with her. In public, she hid behind big sunglasses and a little voice. In photographs, the angle of her hips and dangle of her cigarette were just so.But the wisdom of the documentary, which is available on Netflix, is that it emphasizes prose over pose and keeps returning to her words.They\u2019re read aloud. They appear onscreen in their original typefaces. They\u2019re why anyone cared about the rest of it and why her essay collections \u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem\u201d and \u201cThe White Album\u201d could be found on the bookshelves of just about every aspiring journalist I knew when I was young.Those volumes include this sentence, about an awakening: \u201cThat was the year, my twenty-eighth, when I was discovering that not all of the promises would be kept, that some things are in fact irrevocable and that it had counted after all, every evasion and every procrastination, every mistake, every word, all of it.\u201dAnd this sentence, about college in the 1950s: \u201cI suppose I am talking about just that: the ambiguity of belonging to a generation distrustful of political highs, the historical irrelevancy of growing up convinced that the heart of darkness lay not in some error of social organization but in man\u2019s own blood.\u201dAlso this, about the late \u201960s: \u201cI was meant to know the plot, but all I knew was what I saw: flash pictures in variable sequence, images with no \u2018meaning\u2019 beyond their temporary arrangement, not a movie but a cutting-room experience.\u201dNow even more than when Didion\u2019s career took off, we turn successful writers and other artists into emblems of their eras, props in public dramas, curiosities divorced from any particular accomplishment. Frequently they conspire in that.But they usually get to that point only if there was something of substance to begin with, and they endure only if that something is precious. If it\u2019s gold. At 82 Didion still glitters, on the page and in her nephew\u2019s documentary, not because she had a flair for celebrity but because she had a genius for sentences.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Jim & Andy,\u2019 When Carrey Became Kaufman", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe laughs in the new documentary about Jim Carrey and Andy Kaufman don\u2019t just pop, they also gush. The giggles start with the playful title: \u201cJim & Andy: The Great Beyond \u2014 Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton.\u201d It\u2019s an amusing pileup that in its excess hints at the rich weirdness that emerged when Mr. Carrey nearly went off the rails playing Kaufman in the biopic \u201cMan on the Moon.\u201d One of those tidy, fumbled stories of genius, it will be forever supplanted by this movie\u2019s dizzily, fantastically entertaining account of its two strange, twinned and messy geniuses.Directed by Chris Smith, \u201cJim & Andy\u201d reveals that those earlier reports \u2014 which read as if yet another performer had taken the whole Method acting thing a touch too far \u2014 hardly get at the strangeness that materialized (and lingers). \u201cSo, Jim, how would you start this movie?,\u201d an offscreen Mr. Smith asks Mr. Carrey at the start. Seated in what looks like an anonymous hotel room and wearing a luxurious beard and a leather jacket, Mr. Carrey grunts softly and glances away. And then, looking directly into the camera, he says: \u201cWell, if I had my choice, it wouldn\u2019t start at all. It would already have been.\u201d Mr. Carrey breaks into a small, ambiguous smile. \u201cAnd it wouldn\u2019t end, either.\u201dIs Mr. Carrey smiling at his words or his memories (or at us)? It can be hard to know, an uncertainty that fits the movie\u2019s exploration of reality and its simulations. By contrast, the documentary\u2019s genesis, which is partly spelled out in title cards, is rather clearer and can be traced to some 100 hours of behind-the-scenes video shot during the making of \u201cMan on the Moon.\u201d This material had been stashed in Mr. Carrey\u2019s offices for almost 20 years until the director Spike Jonze (\u201cHer\u201d), a producer on \u201cJim & Andy,\u201d persuaded Mr. Carrey to do something with it. Mr. Smith, whose earlier titles include \u201cAmerican Movie\u201d and \u201cThe Yes Men,\u201d was hired and smartly set his focus on Mr. Carrey.The result isn\u2019t another ho-hum documentary likeness in which all the elements neatly and often flatteringly stack up. \u201cJim & Andy\u201d is instead a complexly layered and textured Cubist portrait, one that\u2019s been constructed from fragments of its two title subjects and their work. In one corner of the portrait there\u2019s something from Mr. Carrey\u2019s life (a story about his father, a glimpse of an early routine); in another, something from Kaufman\u2019s personal history (his family, his work, his illness). Sometimes these fragments rest side by side, at other times they overlap. And, every so often, Kaufman\u2019s notorious alter ego Tony Clifton, an obnoxious lounge lizard, muscles in to upend the entire thing.\u201cJim & Andy\u201d folds a lot into its 95 minutes.

{"Headline": "After Decades of Silence, Small-Town Newspaper Revives Missing Woman\u2019s Case", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCUTCHOGUE, N.Y. \u2014 Sandy Blampied\u2019s life has been shaped by a question left unanswered for decades.In 1966, she was 11 when she kissed her mother goodbye before heading out for school. When she came home that afternoon, her mother, Louise Pietrewicz, was gone.As the years passed and the mystery of what happened went unsolved, Ms. Blampied felt stymied at every turn: When she was younger, she would mention her mother to relatives who quickly hushed her, urging her to move on \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s done already,\u201d she said they told her. She reached out to police detectives, some deeply invested and others seemingly less so, but the investigation moved at a snail\u2019s pace before stalling altogether. She even sought the counsel of psychics. She cried when one told her that her mother\u2019s spirit could not be summoned because she had endured too much pain on earth.Then, one day this summer, there was a message on her answering machine: Steve Wick, a reporter from a newspaper covering the North Fork of Long Island, asked her to call him. He did not say anything more. But Ms. Blampied said she knew in her gut that he had to be inquiring about her mother.\u201cI thought I\u2019d have to wait till I\u2019m dead myself to see her, and then I got the phone call,\u201d Ms. Blampied, who is 63, said. \u201cIt was like a miracle.\u201dThe disappearance of Ms. Pietrewicz is hardly the first case to draw renewed attention years, even decades, later, dusted off by journalists or amateur investigators looking to apply the scrutiny enabled by hindsight and technology to re-examine an old crime. Such productions fill Netflix queues and lists of popular podcasts. But investigations like these are not often undertaken by a community newspaper chain, with reporters juggling months of interviews and poring over typewritten records with the demands of putting out newspapers every week.For her daughter, the new spotlight has offered a thread of fresh hope. For the newspaper\u2019s readers, the reporting \u2014 unspooling the life of a housewife mired in abusive relationships and how law enforcement agencies handled her disappearance \u2014 has caused a stir as it also told a larger story about a community and its evolution over five decades.\u201cThe truth has landed here,\u201d said Mr. Wick, a journalist who has covered Long Island for decades. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncomfortable truth, an unsettling truth.\u201dHer disappearance, as Mr. Wick and his colleague Grant Parpan wrote, \u201cwas hidden away behind a wall of indifference, her plight reduced to small-town gossip and whispered rumors.\u201d Ms. Pietrewicz had never been added to the national missing persons database, and her disappearance went uncovered by local media. \u201cA smashed mailbox makes the blotter,\u201d Mr. Parpan said in an interview, \u201cbut not a missing woman.\u201dBut after the article was published and the documentary released online and broadcast on local television, the case sparked discussions. Martin Flatley, the chief of the local Police Department, said the newspaper was widely read. \u201cAs soon as they read it,\u201d he said of the article, \u201cit\u2019s a topic.\u201dThe article assigns blame for Ms. Pietrewicz\u2019s disappearance to a married police officer she had a relationship with after she became estranged from her husband. It includes notes from an investigator, now dead, who suspected that the officer killed Ms. Pietrewicz and dumped her body. The reporters found that the officer left the area and his own family soon after; he died in New York City and was buried on Hart Island, the city\u2019s potter\u2019s field.But Mr. Wick also saw the article as an indictment of the Southold Police Department of that era, asserting that the department, whose jurisdiction includes Cutchogue, neglected the case. And when the investigation was taken up by the State Police, the reporters contend, the local police helped shield the officer.Chief Flatley said he could find no records that show Ms. Pietrewicz\u2019s disappearance was even reported to the Southold police. But he acknowledged that the agency had shortcomings then, when jobs were often filled by patronage. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to compare,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent time, different era.\u201dMs. Blampied worked in the fields and remembered that her mother did so, too, picking strawberries and selling them at a stand. Her wit and impish sense of humor, Ms. Blampied said, could be traced directly back to her mother.But, she said, her childhood was anything but happy: Her parents fought, her father was verbally and physically abusive, and they ultimately split. Ms. Pietrewicz worked at a soda fountain, where, her daughter believes, she met the officer she had a relationship with. He was also domineering and abusive, like her father. \u201cShe went from the fire pit to the fire,\u201d Ms. Blampied said.After her mother\u2019s disappearance, Ms. Blampied bounced between relatives before returning to her father\u2019s house. She left as soon as she finished high school, moving to Middletown, north of New York City in Orange County, to train in nursing. She has lived there since, with her husband and stepchildren. Still, her mother never vanished from her mind.\u201cIt was always open,\u201d Ms. Blampied said of her mother\u2019s case. \u201cIt was a cross to bear that never ended.\u201dHe had known about Ms. Pietrewicz\u2019s case after years of living in and reporting on the area, even writing a book about farmers on the North Fork. He remembered how a crowd assembled over a decade ago to watch the demolition of a barn on the Pietrewicz farm where she was rumored to have been buried under a Prohibition-era booze cellar. He knew that he wanted to dive into the case.Ms. Blampied was hesitant at first, questioning the journalists\u2019 motives. But soon, she came to trust Mr. Wick and Mr. Parpan, spending countless hours sharing photographs and opening up about some of the most painful parts of her life. \u201cThey know your entire life,\u201d she said of the journalists. \u201cThey\u2019re very special to do what they did.\u201dThe case has received new attention from the authorities. The police took a DNA swab from Ms. Blampied as well as from Ms. Pietrewicz\u2019s last surviving sibling, who is in his 90s. Investigators want to see if there were any matches to unidentified remains. The odds of a resolution remain slim. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely challenging,\u201d Chief Flatley said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s not enough to say she was murdered \u2014 no body, no witnesses, no confession.\u201dOn a recent evening, a ballroom in a retirement community was filled with a sold-out crowd for the documentary\u2019s premiere. Ms. Blampied sat in the front row.In her view, the mystery has not been solved. She can guess, but she does not know for certain what happened to her mother. Still, she believes she has moved closer toward an answer.\u201cBefore, it was like she never existed,\u201d Ms. Blampied said. \u201cI feel more at ease now, because she was recognized. People know: There was a woman by the name of Louise Pietrewicz.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the daughter of Louise Pietrewicz. She is Sandy Blampied, not Blempied.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "NBC Didn\u2019t Fire Matt Lauer. We Did.", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSocial media takes a lot of punches for enabling sexual harassment. But the past two months have shown that it has also provided consumers with an unprecedented power to make their market preferences heard loud and clear. And right now, the market is demanding that companies do something about sexual predators and pests in their midsts. The firing of Matt Lauer \u2014 the \u201cToday\u201d show star who reportedly commanded a salary of $25 million per year \u2014 by NBC News is just the latest example of a company moving swiftly to protect its brand in the face of sexual misconduct allegations.The obvious take here is that the chairman of NBC News, Andrew Lack, made a cold economic calculation: Mr. Lauer might have been a rainmaker for the network, but keeping him on was no longer worth it in the face of potential lawsuits, damage to the brand and lower ratings.But there\u2019s another, more positive, takeaway from Mr. Lauer\u2019s firing, which is that corporations are susceptible to the moral suasion of the public. This might not look like what millennials imagine when they talk about \u201ccorporate social responsibility\u201d and \u201cethical capitalism,\u201d but it\u2019s hard not to see it that way.\u201cEverybody knew\u201d is the stomach-churning line we have heard about so many men revealed as serial sexual offenders in the workplace. And yet they held on to their cushy jobs for years. What changed? Companies like NBC, HBO, Netflix, CBS and the Weinstein Company are more vulnerable to our outrage than ever before.At this point, the list of executives, entertainment legends and media darlings dumped by their companies includes dozens of men, including the longtime news host Charlie Rose, the comedians Andy Dick and Louis C. K., the actors Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Piven, the Amazon Studios executive Roy Price, and the journalists Mark Halperin and Leon Wieseltier. The director Bret Ratner even saw his Hillhaven Lodge whiskey line canceled by the company Diageo after sexual-harassment accusations were made against him.We\u2019re rightfully concerned about how the internet gives corporations more opportunities to exert power over consumers, but we talk far less about the flip side: We have more power over companies now, too. For better or worse, we\u2019ve all become remarkably effective at mobilizing it to our own causes.In contrast, look at Washington. If either Representative John Conyers Jr. or Senator Al Franken were in today\u2019s corporate world, they\u2019d be long gone. And just imagine if Roy Moore was a candidate for a C-suite job this month. He\u2019d have no shot.Instead, at least so far, these politicians have been protected, and whatever happens to them, it\u2019s clear that the political system is structured to insulate men like them from the consequences of their actions and keep their accusers quiet.The same people who often wax poetic about women\u2019s rights, gender discrimination and consent have moved quickly to protect their own. Just check out Nancy Pelosi\u2019s comments concerning Mr. Conyers, whom she praised as an \u201cicon\u201d who had \u201cdone a great deal to protect women\u201d while flip-flopping on whether she believed those accusing him \u2014 something she has seldom had trouble making a quick judgment about when Republicans are involved.Character may no longer count in politics and public service \u2014 if it ever did \u2014 but it matters more than ever in the private sector, where consumer preferences prevail.The modern American capitalist system is far from perfect. But for all its flaws, our system \u2014 and the digital communication channels it enabled \u2014 has delivered social justice more swiftly and effectively than supposedly more enlightened public bodies tend to.As we observe and adjust to the sociosexual storm we\u2019re all in, let\u2019s appreciate the powers and paradigms making it possible: feminism, but also free markets.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Comedy Is Booming. I Can\u2019t Wait for the Bust.", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyWe\u2019ve been in another boom for nearly a decade. This time around, there\u2019s an even greater proliferation of outlets, with an explosion of arena shows; free or cheap stand-up nights; and cable, YouTube and streaming channels devoted to comedy. Perhaps most important has been the expensive push this year by Netflix to become the home of the special.But it\u2019s easy to see telltale signs of oversaturation. \u201cNetflix is releasing a new comedy special every week,\u201d the stand-up Andy Kindler joked in his annual State of the Industry speech this year. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting because now you can binge-watch America getting tired of stand-up comedy again.\u201dBut a crash may be just what comedy needs.To understand why, consider the origin of the current comedy boom. It began around 2009 when the comic Marc Maron started a podcast in his garage and Louis C.K. filmed \u201cHilarious,\u201d his first independently produced special, and signed a deal with FX to make a sitcom with unprecedented artistic control. In the same year, Rob Delaney found an entirely new route to stand-up success via 140-character jokes on Twitter. What has fueled and arguably defined this period is its emphasis on experimentation, which has helped turn comedy into a prestige art form.Much of comedy right now feels stagnant, dominated by the same handful of stars with a flood of talented young performers struggling to break out. When\u2019s the last time a new stand-up superstar came along and changed the game? Will Ali Wong\u2019s special next year make a difference?After two booms, comedy has become such a staple of so many people\u2019s pop culture diets that it\u2019s not going to suddenly dry up. But it could benefit from the disruptive spirit that sparked the second boom.What\u2019s overlooked in the well-worn narrative of the first comedy boom is that it began after an era of remarkable innovation from artists like Steve Martin, Richard Pryor and Andy Kaufman, and its subsequent collapse led to more adventurous work. The bust gave birth to a fertile alternative scene on both coasts that loosened the aesthetic of stand-up. \u201cMr. Show With Bob and David,\u201d \u201cTim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job!\u201d and \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d reinvented sketch comedy. Jon Stewart and Mr. Rock reinvigorated political humor. And the golden age of improvisation flourished in Chicago, with Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Stephen Colbert and others developing their skills, before the Upright Citizens Brigade established an expanding empire on the coasts. The bust hurt the business, but it may have been better for the art of comedy than the boom.Louis C.K.\u2019s downfall may feel like a symbolic bookend of the current boom, but that might be the wrong way to look at it. Comedy is being disrupted right now; the transition will be difficult but also provide opportunities for those willing to adjust. The audience is bigger and more diverse than ever, and so is the pool of performers. Some producers have started looking at a new population of YouTube stars who come with their own followings. Mr. Godbout said he had booked a few of these artists, which has alienated some traditional comedy fans but filled seats. There\u2019s widespread dismissiveness in the scene toward these entertainers, understandably, since many are terribly unfunny. But if comedy is to grow, it needs to be inclusive and open to change.Mr. Godbout compares the state of flux in comedy to that of the movie industry. \u201cPeople say Netflix is killing movies, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only true if you think the business is movie theaters.\u201d For club owners, he added, it might seem like a bubble popped, but for fans, there are more options than ever. \u201cIt\u2019s not about boom and bust,\u201d he said, clarifying that he\u2019s optimistic about the future. \u201cThis is a permanent, seismic shift.\u201dAdvertisement"}

An image of a protest poster with his children\u2019s names was posted online and spread widely. Ethnic slurs aimed at Mr. Pai, whose parents immigrated from India, littered his Twitter feed.And at least 400,000 comments about the issue since April on the F.C.C. site appear to have originated from an apartment in St. Petersburg, Russia, the agency said. It is unclear whether the emails did originate from there, or were made to look as if they did.But none of that has overshadowed the heated reaction to the agency\u2019s proposal.\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be middle ground on this issue,\u201d said John Beahn, a lawyer at Skadden Arps who specializes in regulation.But Mr. Pai, a Republican nominated for the chairmanship by President Trump, said the regulations were heavy-handed and prevented telecom companies from pursuing new business models. His proposal, by stripping away the existing rules, would allow telecom companies to charge websites to deliver their data at higher speeds.\u201cI\u2019d like to cut through hysteria and hot air and speak in plain terms about the plan,\u201d Mr. Pai said, adding that the plan would bring back the regulation-free policy that helped the internet thrive. He said big tech companies might be a bigger threat to online speech than telecom companies.The proposal is expected to be approved at a meeting of the five F.C.C. commissioners on Dec. 14. The two other Republican commissioners have already expressed their support for Mr. Pai.Big web companies like Google and Netflix played activist roles as well, supporting the stronger rules. They argued that telecom companies should not be able to split sites into fast lanes and slow lanes, because that would allow them to become a sort of gatekeeper for information and entertainment. In addition, they say, it would hurt start-ups without the money to pay for the faster lanes.Mr. Pai, who opposed the rules as a commissioner in 2015, gave broad outlines of his plans early this year. For months, comments to the F.C.C. website piled up, to more than 20 million. President Barack Obama\u2019s clean power plan, perhaps his biggest policy change at the Environmental Protection Agency, attracted 4.3 million comments over six months.But the intensity has increased even more since Mr. Pai released the details of the proposal \u2014 perhaps in part because few people expected him to try to strip all of the existing rules.\u201cWhat the tech bloggers and the left don\u2019t like is that there are options and that there is a freedom in the marketplace and that people can choose superior service if they\u2019re willing to pay for it,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said. \u201cAnd if somebody\u2019s willing to pay for superior service, the providers had better provide it.\u201dPublic interest groups like Free Press and organizations like Mozilla, the nonprofit behind the popular Firefox browser, said they were prepared to file suit against the plan as soon as the vote on Dec. 14.\u201cThe action hit a nerve because the internet is central to the vast majority of people\u2019s daily lives, and so people were very eager to understand what was happening over the weekend,\u201d said Denelle Dixon, chief legal officer for Mozilla.The reaction from the biggest tech companies, however, has been noticeably subdued. Instead of forceful pleas from their executives, like those in years past on this issue, they are largely speaking through their trade group, the Internet Association, which has expressed disappointment over Mr. Pai\u2019s plan.\u201cInternet companies are firm supporters of the 2015 Open Internet Order and will continue our push for strong, enforceable net neutrality rules going forward,\u201d said Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association. \u201cWe are reviewing the draft order and weighing our legal options.\u201dTaking their place are start-ups such as Airbnb, Twitter and Reddit, which joined dozens of smaller start-ups on Monday warning Mr. Pai that the rules would hurt innovation and the economy.Sorting out the real individual commenters from fake or automated accounts is far more tricky. The F.C.C. said it did not have the resources to investigate every comment on its site.Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said that after a six-month investigation, his office had found that the identities of tens of thousands of state residents were fraudulently used to post comments to the F.C.C.\u201cIf law enforcement can\u2019t investigate and (where appropriate) prosecute when it happens on this scale,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said, \u201cthe door is open for it to happen again and again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Tear-Stained Confessions of Sam Smith", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "The British pop singer, who has a new album, tried to come out on his own terms. But now he\u2019s listening.Supported byYes, the floodgates really opened once Mr. Smith began to talk about love \u2014 big, delicious tears that coated and magnified his sad, glorious blue eyeballs but never quite leaked out onto his cheeks. He\u2019s fine with his crying, what choice does he have? His father used to cry at a sunset, or after an argument. He encouraged his son to be emotionally expressive. It worked. The superhighway that runs between Mr. Smith\u2019s amygdala and his tear ducts is deep and well worn. He\u2019s been in love, he said, but it was unrequited. Meaning he\u2019s never been loved back. He was crying again.He had been trying. Lord knows he\u2019d been trying. He wanted to be open with the world; he wanted to share his truest self. He wanted to be known. His only goal with his music is to get closer and closer to who he really is, even though that\u2019s sometimes hard when you\u2019re in your young 20s. He\u2019s 25 now. He is trying to bare his soul. But a 25-year-old soul can be a volatile thing. He doesn\u2019t always know how to articulate what he thinks. He doesn\u2019t always realize the implications of what he says. It feels to him like every time he opens his mouth, he gets tased. The soul can be sloppy is his point. The soul can be under construction. Please pardon his soul\u2019s dust during renovations and maturing and figuring things out. This is new to him too.In 2014, Mr. Smith did something revolutionary. He came out publicly as gay just as soon as his album was released. He was not going to leave the question of his sexuality to guesswork or rumor. He thought this was very enlightened, a gay pop singer just integrated into stardom without the waves and the hand-wringing and the controversy. The handful of out gay pop stars before him \u2014 including his idol, George Michael \u2014 mostly endured lengthy \u201care they or aren\u2019t they?\u201d periods before they publicly acknowledged that they were gay. Banking on pop stardom as your whole and complete admitted self wasn\u2019t something that happened every day.The vitriol of the Oscar incident surprised him. His heart was clearly in the right place. He was a proud gay man. How could that not mean anything? \u201cI\u2019m not the most eloquent person,\u201d Mr. Smith says now. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the best grades in school. I mean, I\u2019m just good at singing.\u201dIt felt like he was getting hammered every time he opened his mouth. All he wanted was to remind people that love is love is love, particularly his brand of young adult love: heart-eye emoji love, cupid-arrow love, the love from \u201cThe Notebook\u201d and \u201cTitanic.\u201d That\u2019s how big love is. Once again, on his favorite subject, he pretend-faints on the couch in swoon and desire. He clutches his heart and makes his eyebrows almost touching a near-steeple of longing. This was the thing we all had in common. Why talk about the things that make us different?He grew up with two younger sisters in a pink house; there\u2019s a tattoo of its address around the C6 vertebra of his cervical spine. His bedroom walls were painted a shiny gold and his bed had a red silk duvet. He applied cheap, clumpy mascara each morning and on the gold wall next to his mirror, he dabbed his mascara wand to rid it of excess. One day, in detention, someone told him about dream boards, and so he spent the hour making one to put up on his bedroom wall. There was a sketch of a Grammy there. He drew the back of his head performing to an arena.He came out when he was 10. Literally someone at school said, \u201cAre you gay?\u201d and he said, \u201cI am!\u201d His mother said she\u2019d known since he was 3. He\u2019d always had very short hair, but when he was young, he used to make the gesture of pushing strands behind his ears, like it was long, or flicking imaginary hair off his shoulder. In the car, when the windows were open, he would pretend he\u2019d gotten a hair stuck to his lips and pick it away.And it was all totally fine, even when it wasn\u2019t, even when the first boy he had a crush on said nasty, homophobic things to him that still make him cry. But he had a lot of friends. There were no other (openly) gay boys. He fell in love with straight boys. He could barely picture a future when one of them would look back at him with lust or sexual curiosity, let alone love. And still he was happy. He grew comfortable in his longing. People sometimes made fun of him, but so what? He understood who he was. He thought that if you know who you are, and if you\u2019re confident in that and you don\u2019t make a big deal of it, people will accept you.The rest \u2014 the album, the tour \u2014 it all happened fast. He woke up the day after the Oscars, saw the chaos online, apologized, and slunk off. Why wasn\u2019t this working? People loved his music, but they were turning on him. He couldn\u2019t bear being thought of as a traitor to his people \u2014 he was so open about everything! Sure, he didn\u2019t like Tinder, and it\u2019s mostly true that he didn\u2019t like it because it isn\u2019t romantic, but it is maybe truer that he was afraid he would be swiped away. Believe it or not, he did use Grindr, but he didn\u2019t want random hookups so he arranged dinner dates with several very confused men.Then, one day, he went to Australia for a show, and afterward had a talk with his publicist there, a gay man who lives with his partner of 18 years. The publicist took Mr. Smith to the Stonewall, a gay bar in Sydney, for a drink one afternoon. He decided to help educate him, taking him to a gay bookshop. \u201cMy mind just went,\u201d Mr. Smith said. He read the memoir \u201cHolding the Man,\u201d which blew his mind. He watched \u201cParis Is Burning.\u201d He still has \u201cTales of the City\u201d on his night table. Next, the Australians introduced him to drag. They crammed his feet into thigh-high, high-heeled boots. They draped a red sequin dress over his 6\u20192\u201d body. They had barbecues and played Madonna and danced.\u201cI lived in a village in the middle of nowhere as an openly gay man from the age of 10 years old,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cI didn\u2019t meet another gay man until I was 19 when I moved to London. I just went gay clubbing a few times with some straight friends and with some girlfriends of mine, and then I became famous. I never got an opportunity to find my people in the gay community and find my friends.\u201dHe decided not to drink or smoke or be with a man, even just kissing, for a long time, while he was figuring all this stuff out. He was trying to understand how he fit into the gay community at large. \u201cI just really sat with myself and got to know myself and started to just like my stretch marks and not be so hard on myself and stop watching perfection everywhere.\u201dHe began seeking out the art that struck him as truest. He stopped watching \u201cTitanic\u201d and \u201cThe Notebook.\u201d O.K., he watched \u201cThe Notebook\u201d again last week but he also watched \u201cWeekend,\u201d the gay indie film, so it balanced out.Then he found George Michael. He had always been a fan of his music. He was 15 when he saw him in concert. But now, reading and watching interviews with him in his last years, after Mr. Michael came out, Mr. Smith found him to be a great mentor. \u201cI just feel like I\u2019m going to offend someone every time I open my mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like George Michael had a way of being authentic to himself and honest in a way that was warm.\u201dBack at the interview in West Hollywood, he leaned back on the couch, looked up at the ceiling and blew a stream of breath out through pursed lips. \u201cPeople forget but no one learns about gay history in school. Nothing. So I didn\u2019t know anything about my history as a gay man and then words like \u2018spokesperson\u2019 are being thrown at me when I\u2019ve just brought out my first album,\u201d he said. \u201cIt scared me because I was like, I don\u2019t know anything about being gay, really.\u201dHe realized two things. One was that he was ready to make a second album. The other thing was that coming out as gay wasn\u2019t enough. He now understood that every visible gay person still had a leadership role. He now understood that he wasn\u2019t operating on his own, but that he lived in context to a community whether he\u2019d realized it or not. No, having come out as a gay singer, he realized it was now time to come out as a gay man.Since he left the public eye for the studio, which is where he\u2019d been since the end of his last tour, in 2015, he\u2019d lost a ton of weight by doing something called \u201cintermittent fasting,\u201d meaning he waits five hours after eating to eat again (and which is also called not eating between meals). A trainer. A nutritionist. He stopped eating bread. Probably being a man in his 20s helped.His transformation was sparked by seeing a tabloid picture of himself on the beach without a shirt, and that was not the self he wanted to be. He was also concerned about his health. He gets acid reflux, and it\u2019s bad for his voice. He knows other stars \u201cmime,\u201d as he puts it, but he doesn\u2019t want to. His voice is his whole thing, his whole bag of tricks.Mr. Smith had also cut off his pompadour, which he called his \u201cquiff,\u201d his short hair now reminiscent of George Michael\u2019s on his 2011 Symphonica tour. His hair was thicker than it\u2019s been recently. After the Oscars, it had started falling out from stress, he thought. He began to use Rogaine and take Propecia, and it worked. Men need to talk about hair loss, he thinks.If \u201cIn the Lonely Hour\u201d was the myopic look into the heart of a boy helplessly in love, then the new album, \u201cThe Thrill of It All,\u201d is about a man who turns his gaze outward. \u201cMidnight Train\u201d is a sad song about ending a relationship that was inspired by friends; \u201cPalace,\u201d a sad song about whether or not love is worth it if it ends; \u201cHIM,\u201d a sad story of an imagined boy in Mississippi coming out to his father. Some of the tracks are about Mr. Smith himself, including \u201cBurning,\u201d a sad song about pining for a man who has left; and \u201cOne Last Song,\u201d a sad final ode to the man who was the subject of \u201cIn the Lonely Hour.\u201d The new album won\u2019t be a surprise to anyone familiar with the first one: The old-timey soul is still there. Mr. Smith decided long ago that his voice was the instrument: melisma, whispered baritones, surprise out-of-nowhere ultra-high falsetto, even a haunting, beautiful croak of longing sprinkled here and there. It is still prime music for \u201chaving sex with your sadness,\u201d as Mr. Smith said.But he can now recount actual relationships in his songs. He\u2019s still never been in the kind of magical \u201cNotebook\u201d love he longs for, he said, but about a year ago, he had a five-month relationship that took three breakups before the breakup took and which is the subject of \u201cToo Good at Goodbyes,\u201d the first single off the new album, which is in the Billboard Top 10 as of this writing. He\u2019s been dating the actor Brandon Flynn, from Netflix\u2019s \u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d seeing where that goes.Backstage at the Hollywood Bowl, Mr. Smith drank a cup of Throat Coat, and then took a Gaviscon for acid reflux. He sang through a cocktail straw while holding up a tissue to make it move with his breath to strengthen his throat muscles, something he learned from an opera singer. He motor-boated his lips. He was ready for the show.The next day, the news media would pick up a statement he made about feeling as much like a woman as a man, and social media would get on him for being too casual about gender fluidity when he identifies as a gay man. One day he will get it right, he said, his eyes shiny with big, sad Sam Smith tears.\u201cThe only thing I\u2019d like everyone to know is I\u2019m really sorry if I say the wrong things,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to offend anyone and my intentions are genuinely pure and good.

This could leave many small businesses without the ability to reach their customers and many customers without choices.

Some of them wore high-tech prostheses that made them look superhuman.I wanted to throw my arms around them. I wanted to bake them pizzas. Instead, I told myself my silence was a form of respect. But it was really that I just didn\u2019t have the words.These vets would tell you they\u2019re not superhuman. \u201cI don\u2019t think the challenges in my life are any greater than anyone else\u2019s,\u201d Travis Mills says. \u201cI\u2019m just thankful I was able to serve my country.\u201dBut Mr. Mills, who served with the 82nd Airborne Division, was the reason the wounded veterans were here in my hometown, Belgrade, Me., in the first place.On April 10, 2012, during his third tour of duty in Afghanistan, Mr. Mills placed his backpack on the ground. A mine lay just below the surface. \u201cThe backpack touching the dirt was all it took,\u201d he says. \u201cSuch a simple act of war. My world erupted. I saw a flash of flame and heard a huge ka-boom.\u201dOnly five soldiers in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have survived the loss of both arms and legs. Mr. Mills is one of them.His journey back from that day tells the story not only of one man returning to life. It\u2019s also a story of how a small town has been transformed, and with it, given new hope to wounded soldiers and their families.Maybe Mr. Mills is already on your radar. His autobiography, \u201cAs Tough as They Come,\u201d was a best seller. A movie is in the works, with Adam Driver as Mr. Mills and Sylvester Stallone as his unsinkable father-in-law. A documentary, \u201cTravis: A Soldier\u2019s Story,\u201d is available on Netflix.I first met Mr. Mills at, of all places, a writers\u2019 conference in California. Even though we come from the same small town, and we\u2019re both authors, we\u2019d never met before.He told me about his project to transform an old estate into a place where wounded veterans and their families can gather, free of charge, for a week of community and conversation on the shores of a lake in Maine. Once, he said with a luminous grin, it had been owned by Elizabeth Arden.Everyone in town knows about the old Arden estate. From the 1930s to the 1970s it was called the Maine Chance resort, not only the glamorous home of the cosmetics magnate but a kind of Betty Ford Center of its day, a place where society ladies and Hollywood celebrities, among others, could escape to for the summer to dry out. Judy Garland stayed there. So did Mamie Eisenhower. The elegant mansion on the hill over the lake was once an essential part of the town\u2019s economy, not to mention an essential part of its mythology.But the Maine Chance fell into disrepair. Its tattered shell overlooked Arden Cove on Long Pond. A dirt path leading into the woods was still marked \u201cElizabeth Arden Road\u201d on a few old maps, but it was virtually impassable except by mountain bike or A.T.V.On a sunny Saturday in October, the new Travis Mills Foundation center for wounded veterans held an open house, and the elegant old grounds were full of vets and their families.\u201cLook, the V.A. does the best it can,\u201d a Vietnam-era mess sergeant told me, as we waited in line to have our photographs taken with Mr. Mills. \u201cBut it stays with you forever, once you\u2019ve served. You\u2019re never the same. People need places like this, places where vets can feel like they\u2019re not alone.\u201dNow, in rooms once graced by celebrities of yesteryear like Lilian Gish and Ava Gardner and Edna Ferber, wounded veterans and their families have that place. It has been made possible because of the support from donors, including the Barbara Bush Foundation, Wayfair and New Balance \u2014 but most of all because of the charisma of Mr. Mills.I left the open house wearing a bracelet imprinted with Mr. Mills\u2019s mantra: \u201cNever Give Up, Never Quit.\u201d Later, I took a bike ride through the woods along the old Elizabeth Arden Road. As I headed deeper and deeper into the woods, the road deteriorated until it wasn\u2019t much more than a gnarled footpath over the shoulders of McGaffey Mountain.At one particularly difficult hill, I got off of my bike and began walking it. Until I met Mr. Mills, I hadn\u2019t given much thought to the fact that I have two arms and two legs, that no one has ever tried to kill me, that there are millions of Americans who have given their lives to make my life possible. But I was thinking about it now.And then, just off to one side of the path, I saw a single grave, surrounded by a beaten split-rail fence. I put my bike down and walked into the woods to look at it.\u201cJohn Rogers,\u201d it said. Sgt. Continental Line. Revolutionary War. 1756-1849. A small American flag fluttered by the stone.I had been so certain that I was all alone on the old Elizabeth Arden Road. But there, in the heart of the deep Maine forest, was this well-tended grave.

More expansive than interior, more defiant than dreamy, it\u2019s a vibrant if uneven work in heated conversation with itself.This year\u2019s Nola is still seeing a trio of men. Jamie Overstreet (Lyriq Bent), an investment banker semi-separated from his wife, is mature but paternalistic; Greer Childs (Cleo Anthony), a model and photographer, is gorgeous but vain; Mars Blackmon (Anthony Ramos, \u201cHamilton\u201d), an update of Mr. Lee\u2019s basketball-obsessed B-boy of Nike commercial fame, is childlike but childish.(About Mars: though Mr. Lee has revised the character \u2014 making him part Puerto Rican, for instance \u2014 it\u2019s still jarring to see anyone else don his mega-spectacles and step, in 2017, into an icon so throughly associated with mid-80s culture. It\u2019s a little like unretiring Michael Jordan\u2019s jersey.)Mr. Lee directs every episode, as evidenced by the direct-to-camera monologues and dolly shots. But he shares writing duties with a staff that includes several women, among them the playwright Lynn Nottage and Joie Lee, Mr. Lee\u2019s sister (who also plays Nola\u2019s mother), and the scripts are attuned to the nuances of sexism.Hollywood\u2019s diversity problem has been getting some needed attention in recent years, but black American filmmakers have been making great movies since the dawn of cinema. See all the titles in this collection on Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site.The season\u2019s five-hour run allows time to build out the supporting characters. Opal (Ilfenesh Hadera), who in the film was an opportunistic lesbian siren, becomes a more rounded character with a romantic past, and perhaps future, with Nola.Not every expansion works. A subplot about butt augmentation is a bad misfire, both scolding and flippant; a digression into Jamie\u2019s marriage is dull. As often on Netflix, less story would have been more, and the tone swings from stagy to naturalistic to over-the-top satirical.But Ms. Wise is a unifying presence: Her forward, fiery portrayal couldn\u2019t be better timed for a cultural moment of women clapping back at harassment.Brooklyn too is changed: white hipster waiters with fulsome beards serving artisanal cocktails, black old-timers getting \u201cWe Buy Homes for Cash!\u201d fliers jammed under their doors. Yet Mr. Lee can\u2019t help but shoot this Fort Greene as lovingly as the graffiti-painted Brooklyn of 1986.The camera here bursts with affection: for the moment, for the past, for black culture, for Nola, for art. Mr. Lee punctuates scenes with album covers of his soundtrack choices, like a vinyl enthusiast showing off his collection. There\u2019s also grief, when the season \u2014 set in 2016 \u2014 mourns the election of Donald J. Trump and throws a bittersweet wake for Prince.It also shows how Mr. Lee\u2019s toolbox has filled over three decades. His reprise of the climactic Thanksgiving dinner with Nola and her lovers is more playful and ambitious, as if he\u2019s nudging his younger self across the decades: Can you do this, kid?But the scene that sticks with me comes the episode before. Nola stands in front of one of her works, a self-portrait in multiple images, captioned with an Audre Lorde quote. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t define myself for myself,\u201d it says, \u201cI would be crunched into other people\u2019s fantasies for me and eaten alive.\u201dMusic starts playing \u2014 Meshell Ndegeocello\u2019s \u201cFaithful\u201d \u2014 and Nola begins \u2026 revolving. The camera focuses on her, then her portrait, then her again. Finally, she throws her head back and wails, and words spill onto the screen \u2014 \u201cFlesh,\u201d and \u201cTrust,\u201d and the names of her lovers, and \u201cMyself.\u201dIt\u2019s transfixing. It\u2019s daring. It is, maybe, a bit much. But Mr. Lee keeps taking in his subject, turning and turning, waiting a little longer to catch her from every angle.Advertisement"}

The political writer Mark Halperin faces allegations of past sexual misconduct with women under his authority at work. Similar accusations have been made against the actor Dustin Hoffman, who has apologized for bad behavior.As a result, the following has happened: Netflix shut down the Spacey star vehicle \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and shelved a film called \u201cGore,\u201d which was in postproduction and in which Mr. Spacey plays the writer Gore Vidal. HBO scrapped a planned mini-series and Penguin Press a book on the 2016 presidential election, which Mr. Halperin had written with his collaborator of recent years, John Heilemann. And suggestions have been made in print and pixels that Mr. Hoffman\u2019s films, past and present, should be boycotted.No doubt, the corporate suits at Netflix, HBO and Penguin decided it was simply bad business to proceed with those projects, given how toxic the men are right now. That\u2019s understandable. But isn\u2019t it also reasonable to ask what ultimately should be the fate of these works (and not just because deep-sixing them hurts many others who also had a hand in creating them)?Mr. Spacey is widely recognized as one of our most accomplished actors. Whatever his sins, many audiences would want to see how he portrays Vidal, one of our most controversial writers. The Halperin-Heilemann team, while not an art master, has produced important records of recent presidential elections. Its insight into the 2016 race would probably have qualified as a must-read. As for Mr. Hoffman, do the allegations against him negate his talent, including his starring role in \u201cTootsie,\u201d ranked No. 2 on the American Film Institute\u2019s list of the funniest American movies ever made?It will come as no surprise if, in time, there\u2019s a reassessment of some of the men now justifiably shamed in the dock of public opinion. We have seen the phenomenon plenty of times. Many figures in the arts were people who committed terrible deeds or held reprehensible views, and yet came to be admired, even revered.Caravaggio was a murderous thug. Ezra Pound was a pro-fascist and pro-Nazi anti-Semite. Virginia Woolf had an anti-Semitic streak of her own. T. S. Eliot out-and-out hated Jews. Picasso treated the women in his life abysmally; two killed themselves. Norman Mailer stabbed his wife. Walt Whitman likened the \u201cintellect and caliber\u201d of blacks to that of \u201cso many baboons.\u201d William Golding tried to rape a 15-year-old girl. The list could go on.Of course, all those people are dead. Disreputable living artists present a more complex situation: Can we avoid having their behavior shape how we evaluate their work? How much should we be bothered that they stand to profit further by having their movies and books in circulation?So which counts more: rotten behavior or admirable art? Even as we wade through the current scandals, we might keep this question in mind, for it has endured through the ages and may yet surface again.Advertisement"}

It opens in 1859, in Victorian Canada, where Grace Marks (Sarah Gadon), a household servant, has been imprisoned for the 1843 murder of a farmer (Paul Gross) and his housekeeper (Anna Paquin).Grace is a sensation, a celebrity even, in large part because she\u2019s a young, mild-mannered woman. That circumstance affects every aspect of her case.The actual killer, a stable hand (Kerr Logan) accuses her of using her wiles to manipulate him and mastermind the crime. She attracts the paternalistic interest of benefactors who want to see her pardoned. They hire a progressive young doctor, Simon Jordan (Edward Holcroft), to question and hopefully save her \u2014 though his curiosity is laced with condescension.Grace is simultaneously vulnerable and strong. She\u2019s a prisoner, a poor Irish immigrant, in an era where servant women are subject to the whims, and sometimes lusts, of their employers. Yet there\u2019s a power in the fascination that her case inspires. Dr. Jordan hangs on her every word, and those words are all she has.This adds tension and calculation to the flashback narrative. As Grace traces her route from a childhood of abuse to her last fateful posting, she\u2019s gauging what Dr. Jordan might want to hear, feeling his reaction, titrating her response.Is she innocent, guilty, crazy? \u201cAlias Grace\u201d is less about finding the definitive truth than watching Grace feel her way to the answer that could save her.Great works of literature don\u2019t always translate well to the screen, but these standout titles do justice to their source materials. See the full collection on Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site.\u201cAlias Grace\u201d is a story about storytelling \u2014 one character compares Grace with Scheherazade \u2014 which makes Ms. Gadon essential to its success. She is mesmerizing. She plays Grace convincingly as a timid child and a toughened inmate, and she brings both of them to Grace\u2019s wary testimony.The novel by Ms. Atwood (who has a bit part as \u201cDisapproving Woman\u201d) is a challenge to adapt visually. It\u2019s as internal and retrospective as \u201cHandmaid\u2019s\u201d is propulsive, though both protagonists are slyly defiant. The screenwriter, Sarah Polley (who adapted a story from the Canadian author Alice Munro into the film \u201cAway from Her\u201d), turns it into a sinuous, layered script that is constantly aware of what is being said, to whom and why.Mary Harron (\u201cI Shot Andy Warhol\u201d) directs the series dynamically. In an early sequence, Grace\u2019s meditates on the curious phrase \u201ccelebrated murderess\u201d over quick cuts of the crime \u2014 a body tumbling to the floor, a strip of cloth tightening around a throat.For all that, \u201cAlias Grace\u201d isn\u2019t overly brutal. It\u2019s an exquisitely woven fabric with blood staining the corners. The violence is often in the language, as when a servant woman describes a death scene \u2014 the result of an illegal abortion \u2014 as smelling like a butcher shop.The series is conscious of class \u2014 there\u2019s a little primer on colonial Canadian populism \u2014 and of how patriarchy pits women against women, like Nancy Montgomery (Ms. Paquin), the housekeeper and jealous lover of Grace\u2019s employer, who terrorizes the staff below her.Above all, \u201cAlias Grace\u201d is about how men abuse power over women, and how that power is always present, even when the men aren\u2019t. It\u2019s present in something as innocuous as a wedding quilt, which Grace likens to a battle flag. A bed may seem like a place of rest, she tells Dr. Jordan, but \u201cthere are many dangerous things that need take place on a bed.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t seem to be the message of the Year of Atwood, with \u201cGrace\u201d and \u201cHandmaid\u201d standing like beacons centuries apart. Look back on the calendar, they say, and look forward. The year changes. The time does not.Advertisement"}

They have turned a network whose very promise was endless innovation into one stuck in mud, where every start-up is at the tender mercy of some of the largest corporations on the planet.The internet\u2019s singular power, in its early gold-rush days, was its flexibility. People could imagine a dazzling array of new uses for the network, and as quick as that, they could build and deploy them \u2014 a site that sold you books, a site that cataloged the world\u2019s information, an application that let you \u201cborrow\u201d other people\u2019s music, a social network that could connect you to anyone.You didn\u2019t need permission for any of this stuff; some of these innovations ruined traditional industries, some fundamentally altered society, and many were legally dubious. But the internet meant you could just put it up, and if it worked, the rest of the world would quickly adopt it.But if flexibility was the early internet\u2019s promise, it was soon imperiled. In 2003, Tim Wu, a law professor now at Columbia Law School (he\u2019s also a contributor to The New York Times), saw signs of impending corporate control over the growing internet. Broadband companies that were investing great sums to roll out faster and faster internet service to Americans were becoming wary of running an anything-goes network.Though it has been through a barrage of legal challenges and resurrections, some form of net neutrality has been the governing regime on the internet since 2005. The new F.C.C. order would undo the idea completely; companies would be allowed to block or demand payment for certain traffic as they liked, as long as they disclosed the arrangements.At the moment, broadband companies are promising not to act unfairly, and they argue that undoing the rules would give them further incentive to invest in their broadband capacity, ultimately improving the internet.Brian Hart, an F.C.C. spokesman, said broadband companies would still be covered by antitrust laws and other rules meant to prevent anticompetitive behavior. He noted that Mr. Pai\u2019s proposals would simply return the network to an earlier, pre-network-neutrality regulatory era.\u201cThe internet flourished under this framework before, and it will again,\u201d he said.Broadband companies are taking a similar line. When I pointed out to a Comcast spokeswoman that the company\u2019s promises were only voluntary \u2014 that nothing will prevent Comcast from one day creating special tiers of internet service with bundled content, much like the way it now sells cable TV \u2014 she suggested I was jumping the gun.Well, O.K. But a vibrant network doesn\u2019t die all at once. It takes time and neglect; it grows weaker by the day, but imperceptibly, so that one day we are living in a digital world controlled by giants and we come to regard the whole thing as normal.It\u2019s not normal. It wasn\u2019t always this way. The internet doesn\u2019t have to be a corporate playground. That\u2019s just the path we\u2019ve chosen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sex, Drugs and Crime in the Gritty Drama \u2018Babylon Berlin\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 It\u2019s the spring of 1929, and this city is a fast-moving modern metropolis where artistic and sexual experimentation flourishes against a backdrop of organized crime, political street battles and a fragile democratic order.This ambitious 16-part, two-season show has already been sold to 60 TV markets. It had its British premiere on Sunday night on Sky Atlantic and will begin streaming on Netflix in the United States on Jan. 30.The troubled young detective is assisted by Charlotte Ritter, a police typist played by Liv Lisa Fries, who strives to make the most of Weimar Berlin\u2019s new freedoms to escape the poverty of her bleak, overcrowded tenement. By day she picks up sporadic work at police headquarters, and by night turns tricks at Moka Efti, a nightclub and temple to hedonism.The complicated plot encompasses a Russian freight train carrying poison gas and gold; secret military maneuvers; and a brutal May Day confrontation between police and Communists. There are Soviet agents and Trotskyist agitators, a cross-dressing jazz singer, an Armenian mafia boss and a rich industrialist in cahoots with a group of army officers.The star of the show, however, is Berlin. The lavish production lovingly recreates the city\u2019s 1920s streets, cafes and nightclubs. Around 70 percent of the series was shot on location, with the rest filmed on a massive set at the historic Babelsberg studios.Costing 38 million euros (about $44 million) to produce, the 180-day shoot involved three crews and three writer/directors: Tom Tykwer (of \u201cPerfume\u201d and \u201cRun Lola Run\u201d fame), Achim von Borries and Henk Handloegten, who had all long sought to work together on a project based on this period.\u201cThe three of us had the idea to do a big panoramic view of the society at the end of the 1920s, the Weimar Republic, before we actually knew the novels,\u201d Mr. Handloegten said.The makers of \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d however, were interested in exploring the prelude to the Third Reich. \u201cAll these people didn\u2019t fall from the sky as Nazis,\u201d Mr. Handloegten said. \u201cThey had to become Nazis.\u201dIn writing the screenplay, the creators made some key changes to the books. As well as expanding the political elements, they turned Gereon Rath into a more sympathetic character, traumatized by his experiences in World War I, prone to fits of shaking and addicted to morphine.Charlotte Ritter is no longer a bourgeois law student but a street-smart working-class woman. \u201cWe felt very strongly that we should have a main character from this proletarian background, because Berlin was always a poor city,\u201d Mr. Handloegten explained.Work has already begun on Season 3, and there\u2019s plenty more source material to draw on. Mr. Kutscher has already written six Gereon Rath novels and plans another three, culminating with Kristallnacht in 1938.The TV adaptation is already a commercial and critical hit at home. Within a week of its German premiere on Oct. 13, the first episode had been watched by 1.2 million people \u2014 a German viewing figure bested only by \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\u201cThe show is epic, the story is complex,\u201d the Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel wrote. \u201cThe TV version gives the material what it requires while never taking away the striking images, ambiguous characters and exciting story: everything needed to suck you in.\u201dThe weekly magazine Der Spiegel described the show as a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d and a \u201cgreat, dizzying panorama,\u201d and predicted that it could be \u201cthe first big German TV production since \u2018Das Boot\u2019 to have really relevant success abroad.\u201dThe praise, however, has not been universal. The Munich-based daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung said: \u201cThe period it depicts may have been sensuous, but the show is not. The world of \u2018Babylon Berlin\u2019 remains behind glass.\u201dIn Britain, the reception has been positive so far. \u201cIt\u2019s all wonderfully gripping, and Bruch has the most pained, expressive eyes you\u2019ll see all year,\u201d the critic for The Financial Times wrote. \u201cWith the arrival of Charlotte \u2026 drab secretary by day, jazz baby by night, we enter the youthful Berlin of dance crazes and desperate excess.\u201dSome critics have also drawn parallels to current political events, like the American election of Donald J. Trump, the Brexit vote, and the arrival of the far-right Alternative for Germany in the Bundestag.\u201cThe echoes of the \u2018populism\u2019 of the 1930s with what is going on right now is certainly a link that is being made,\u201d Professor Cooke said. \u201cHow far this is played out in the show itself remains to be seen. But it is fair to say that these kinds of historical dramas always tend to use the past as a cipher for the present.\u201dBut Hajo Funke, professor of political science at the Free University Berlin, cautions against making too many comparisons. \u201cEconomically, socially and politically, it was a totally different situation,\u201d he said.\u201cIn 1929, there was a brief phase of stability after the terrible shock at the end of World War I, the inflation crisis, the economic restrictions,\u201d Professor Funke added. \u201cIt was not at all clear if it would be possible to overcome the next crisis.\u201dAt the same time, he agrees that the show taps into the current mood. \u201cIt could serve to point to the dangers, to the destructive forces in society and politics,\u201d he said.For the makers of \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d it was crucial that the audience experience the past through the eyes of the protagonists.\u201cIn 1929, there were no Nazis in Berlin,\u201d said the producer Stefan Arndt. \u201cYou cannot see or even smell that there\u2019s danger coming.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Did You Hear the One About the Housewife Who Walks Into a Comedy Club?", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a summer day in Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Park, the sun savaged a swarm of actors in sturdy wool coats and pert hats. The men were sweating. The women were sweating. Even the carousel horses looked hot.Not that she could do much of anything until Matteo Pascale, the child actor playing Ethan, said his line, \u201cGo away!\u201d The boy, perched on a carousel pony, didn\u2019t want to say it.Ms. Brosnahan tried sympathy: \u201cI know you would never say that to your mom, but I\u2019m only pretend.\u201dShe tried sense: \u201cThe sooner you\u2019ll say it, the sooner you\u2019ll be done.\u201dFinally, she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear me talk any more.\u201dThat\u2019s a controversial statement. As the latest show from Ms. Sherman-Palladino, who created \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d and \u201cBunheads,\u201d \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d is predicated on the great pleasure of hearing brainy, mouthy women talk until their lips ache.Her Bronx-born dad had made his start in the early \u201960s in Greenwich Village basket houses (so-called because performers worked for tips tossed into passed baskets), a time and a scene Ms. Sherman-Palladino long envied. In a pitch meeting with Amazon, she said she started to riff on how it would feel for a woman to enter that comedy man\u2019s world. \u201cI have a big mouth, and it sort of just happened,\u201d she said.Well-behaved women seldom make for good television. See all the titles in this collection on Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site.On a weekday morning in early fall, Ms. Sherman-Palladino, mouth and all, sat next to her husband, Daniel Palladino, a director, writer and executive producer on the show. They had crammed together onto a couch in a corner of the Chelsea sound studio where they had met to edit the first-season finale. On the street below, a woman walked by wearing a tank top that read, \u201cOy with the poodles already,\u201d a beloved \u201cGilmore\u201d catchphrase. \u201cIt\u2019s funny what people pick up on,\u201d Mr. Palladino said.As in Ms. Sherman-Palladino\u2019s previous shows, \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d pals around with a woman after a domestic cataclysm sort of just happens. Lorelai Gilmore, a Harvard-bound debutante, has a kid at 16 and flees her upper-class family for an unglamorous job at an inn. Michelle Simms, the protagonist of \u201cBunheads,\u201d goes from Vegas showgirl to beach town widow. Midge Maisel puts down the Pyrex and picks up a mic.Like Lorelai, like Michelle, Midge finds herself \u201cin a whole other life that she hadn\u2019t really thought about or considered,\u201d Ms. Sherman-Palladino said.As compared with those other shows, that life is a lot more artfully rendered. Midge has a knockout period wardrobe in sea green and paradise pink. Midcentury New York cleans up well, too. The characters are Upper West Side Jews, a seeming contrast to the Connecticut WASPs of \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d although as Ms. Sherman-Palladino said, \u201cLorelai and Rory were the most Jewish WASPs I\u2019ve ever written for.\u201d (Remember \u201cOy with the poodles\u201d?)While Amazon declined to comment on how a lively, lippy, New York-centric comedy like \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d meshed with these other projects, the streaming service signed Ms. Sherman-Palladino and her husband to an overall deal in September.Marc Resteghini, Amazon\u2019s head of current series, wrote in an email that the service had been attracted to \u201can exciting and colorful portrait of a character, who was beautifully inhabited by Rachel Brosnahan. We knew immediately that we wanted to see more than just one season.\u201dAfter years of having networks and studios interfere with their past shows, Ms. Sherman-Palladino described the relief of landing at Amazon.\u201cThey trust us,\u201d she said, adding a profane intensifier. (Ms. Sherman-Palladino adds a lot of profane intensifiers.)It\u2019s a pleasure they haven\u2019t been indulging. For the first season of \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d they wrote and directed seven of the eight episodes. They chose the chirpy music (heavy on the Peggy Lee), they oversaw the jewel-tone design, they masterminded the editing and the sound mixing.\u201cWhich is a racy joke and one of the best jokes ever,\u201d Ms. Sherman-Palladino said.Mr. Palladino added, \u201cThat\u2019s what all stand-up comics do.\u201dMs. Brosnahan said she doesn\u2019t think of herself as a comedian. She has never tried stand-up, except while filming, and she doesn\u2019t plan to. \u201cThe idea of doing an open mic makes me throw up,\u201d she said, sitting in a West Village cafe near the clubs where Midge would have performed. (Rain had curtailed a walk past those clubs.)Shooting the pilot, she felt \u201chorrified just petrified\u201d about the stand-up sequence. Having shot seven more episodes, she added, \u201cI remain completely petrified in a really satisfying way, you know?\u201dWhat else might satisfy?Midge herself, who Ms. Sherman-Palladino describes as \u201cpure energy and pure light and such strength,\u201d which makes her sound like a lot of Ms. Sherman-Palladino\u2019s talky, resilient women.But there\u2019s a key difference. Midge, Ms. Sherman-Palladino said proudly, has found \u201ca much bigger audience to mouth off at.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With AT&T and Time Warner, Battle Lines Form for an Epic Antitrust Case", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIf the government goes to court to block the merger of AT&T and Time Warner, as seems increasingly likely, it may well be the antitrust case of the decade, even without the claims of presidential meddling that have already engulfed the deal in partisan controversy.A lawsuit by the Justice Department, along with its earlier, widely reported demands that AT&T sell either DirecTV or Turner Broadcasting to gain approval for the deal, would mark a radical departure from decades of antitrust enforcement policy, both in defining what is an unlawful anticompetitive merger and in fashioning a remedy to cure the problems.That\u2019s because the combination of AT&T and Time Warner is what\u2019s known as a \u201cvertical\u201d merger, meaning that the two companies don\u2019t compete to any significant degree in their primary lines of business, which are telecommunications (AT&T) and entertainment (Time Warner). There would be the same number of competitors in both fields after the merger as there were before it.This week, two Barclays analysts, Kannan Venkateshwar and Amir Rozwadowski, called the government\u2019s threat to block the deal \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said they were \u201cperplexed\u201d given the Justice Department\u2019s longstanding leniency toward vertical mergers.Referring to Louis D. Brandeis, the former Supreme Court justice, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a populist, Brandeisian movement that\u2019s rising.\u201dPresident Trump tapped into that sentiment during the campaign when he described the proposed AT&T-Time Warner combination as \u201ca deal we will not approve in my administration because it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201dThat\u2019s a view shared by many progressive media critics, including an influential group of young antitrust professors who have been calling for stricter review of vertical mergers, especially in media and entertainment. Prominent Democrats also criticized the proposed deal.But since the election, Mr. Trump has continued to insert himself into what is supposed to be an independent review. On Wednesday, even as the Justice Department was said to be putting the finishing touches on its complaint, he renewed his attacks on CNN, the Time Warner-owned cable news network and his No. 1 media nemesis.The Justice Department hasn\u2019t explicitly demanded that AT&T divest CNN, but it\u2019s a key part of Turner Broadcasting. Should CNN be sold, it could easily fall into the hands of far more Trump-friendly owners than AT&T or Time Warner, such as conservative-leaning Sinclair Broadcasting, which has been on the acquisitions trail, or Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox. Fox bid for all of Time Warner\u2019s assets in 2014 but said at the time that it would divest CNN to avoid antitrust concerns. (Fox might find Trump-appointed antitrust regulators to be friendlier this time.)Even when the government challenges vertical mergers, they are usually resolved by consent decree or other arrangements, in which the merged companies agree not to engage in anticompetitive behavior and to abide by conditions imposed by the government.That was the approach when Comcast acquired NBC Universal in 2011, a deal that raised many of these same issues. Comcast agreed to more than 150 conditions, many aimed at preventing Comcast from favoring NBC Universal content at the expense of competitors.While there continue to be critics of the Comcast-NBC merger, it\u2019s hard to argue that competition in news and entertainment has diminished as a result, given the rise of Netflix and Amazon and the explosion in entertainment options that followed the merger.But there\u2019s also a growing sense that such agreements are easily circumvented and that the government doesn\u2019t have the resources to oversee hundreds of such limitations. The alternative is to demand divestitures, as the government has done during negotiations with AT&T. Such \u201cstructural\u201d remedies, as they\u2019re known, \u201care much easier than behavioral remedies to craft and enforce,\u201d Professor Stucke said.\u201cOur goal in remedying unlawful transactions should be to let the competitive process play out,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, behavioral remedies often fail to do that. Instead of protecting the competition that might be lost in an unlawful merger, a behavioral remedy supplants competition with regulation.\u201dDivestitures have long been the preferred remedy for horizontal mergers, where there\u2019s an overlap between the two companies. Airlines, for example, may have to sell routes or airport gates where the two airlines compete; cable operators may have to sell operations in cities where both companies operate.A study by the Federal Trade Commission found that concerns about every vertical merger examined by the commission from 2006 to 2012 were resolved through \u201cconduct remedies\u201d rather than divestitures, and that all these remedies had been successful at protecting competition.That hasn\u2019t mollified a new generation of antitrust activists. Tim Wu, an antitrust professor at Columbia University and one of the leading proponents of a more intense scrutiny of media mergers, told me that the deal should be blocked on grounds that a combined megacompany could exert \u201cbroad anticompetitive effects.\u201dSay, for example, that a combined AT&T-Time Warner aggressively raised prices for popular offerings like HBO and CNN. Rival distributors, such as cable companies, would have to pay much higher prices, passing the increases on to consumers, or drop the channels, forcing consumers who want them to turn to other distributors, such as AT&T, reinforcing its already commanding position in satellite, wireless and broadband distribution.This threat of higher prices and restricted consumer choice appears to be the theory the Justice Department is pursuing, according to people briefed on the negotiations.Further clouding any action is Mr. Trump\u2019s outspoken animosity toward CNN. Antitrust enforcement decisions are supposed to be based solely on the facts and law, not on politics, and no one I spoke to could recall a president who so publicly inserted himself into an antitrust enforcement investigation. (While Richard Nixon notoriously meddled in antitrust enforcement in the 1970s, he kept his machinations secret, at least until they were exposed by Oval Office tape recordings.)Mr. Delrahim has pledged an independent review uninfluenced by politics. Professor Stucke noted that the investigation began during the Obama administration, and that \u201cit\u2019s unlikely senior leadership would go out on a limb to challenge the merger unless the staff had recommended it.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re career professionals,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d start with the presumption the staff was diligent and followed the evidence.\u201dAn AT&T spokesman declined to comment, as did the Department of Justice.Asked this week whether there had been communications about the case with the White House, Attorney General Jeff Sessions declined to answer, fueling speculation that there may have been some.Should the case be filed and go to trial, that\u2019s one mystery that will soon be resolved: Some of AT&T\u2019s first subpoenas will no doubt go to the White House.An earlier version of this column erroneously included Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont among the Democrats who have criticized the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner. Mr. Sanders is an independent, not a Democrat.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Muslim Women, Caught Between Islamophobes and \u2018Our Men\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 The unending tide of accounts of sexual harassment and assault by powerful men that women are suddenly allowing themselves to share is a reminder of the ubiquity of sexual violence that women worldwide have long known too well \u2014 and that men in a few places are finally, albeit reluctantly, acknowledging.It is a watershed moment finally to recognize the global reach and power of patriarchy, be it in entertainment, media, business or politics, whether in Hollywood, Washington, Paris or elsewhere.In this month alone, terminations, resignations and accusations have starkly highlighted the prevalence of patriarchy\u2019s crimes, for too long enabled by institutions that knew but failed to act.The actor Kevin Spacey was fired by Netflix. Britain\u2019s secretary of state for defense, Michael Fallon, was forced to resign. One current and three former female legislators told The Associated Press that they, too, were harassed or subjected to hostile sexual comments by fellow members of Congress. After Val\u00e9rie Plante defeated the incumbent mayor of Montreal in an election on Nov. 5, and women won seven of the city\u2019s 19 borough mayorships, a prominent Quebec feminist, Francine Pelletier, attributed the gains to a \u201cfeminine wave of disgust at the way politics and powerful people conduct themselves.\u201dIn Egypt and Lebanon, social media users shared stories chronicling their experiences, and in India, a woman opened an online campaign to name and shame university teachers alleged to have sexually harassed or assaulted students.Given the global reach of such claims, you would think that when the Swiss-born Muslim scholar Tariq Ramadan, now on leave from teaching at Oxford in England, faced (and denied) accusations of rape and sexual assault from at least three women, that report alone would have reminded everyone that sexual harassment and worse can exist in any community.For Muslims, however, the reports have instead served as a reminder that we Muslim women are caught between a rock and a hard place \u2014 a trap presenting near-impossible obstacles for exposing sexual violence.The rock is an Islamophobic right wing in other cultures that is all too eager to demonize Muslim men. Exhibit A is President Trump, who has himself been accused of sexually harassing women and was caught on tape bragging about it. Nevertheless, he has used so-called honor crimes and misogyny (which he ascribes to Muslim men) to justify his efforts to ban travel to the United States from several Muslim-majority countries.An ascendant right wing in European politics meanwhile jumps to connect any reports of misconduct by Muslim men to their Muslimness and to Islam as a faith rather than to their maleness and the power with which patriarchy rewards it around the globe. Witness the aftermath of a sexual assault against women in Cologne, Germany, on New Year\u2019s Eve two years ago, in which the men\u2019s faith and ethnic backgrounds were highlighted as explanations of the assaults.\u201cMany Muslim women have been reluctant to discuss this Tariq Ramadan case because in part they don\u2019t want to feed into elements of the media\u2019s Islamophobic and racist framing of these allegations,\u201d Shaista Aziz, an Oxford-based freelance journalist, told me. \u201cThis does nothing to encourage women to report sexual violence.\u201dThe hard place is a community within our own faith that is all too eager to defend Muslim men against all accusations. Mr. Ramadan\u2019s defenders have dismissed the complaints against him as a \u201cZionist conspiracy\u201d and an Islamophobic attempt to destroy a Muslim scholar. Too often, when Muslim women speak out, some in our \u201ccommunity\u201d accuse us of \u201cmaking our men look bad\u201d and of giving ammunition to right-wing Islamophobes.But they get it wrong. It is the harassers and assaulters who make us \u201clook bad,\u201d not the women who have every right to expose crimes against them. Mr. Ramadan\u2019s case is also a reminder of the veneration of Muslim male scholars that gives them incredible and often unchecked power.Indeed, Mr. Ramadan himself accused me in 2011 of \u201cbetraying the community\u201d (code for disagreeing with him) when we argued about the French ban on the face veil on a BBC television program. Mr. Ramadan, while insisting that any conversation about veiling must be among Muslims only, incessantly interrupted me as I tried to contribute my views as a Muslim woman who had worn hijab for nine years. He accused me of being a neoconservative. I told him that his attempt to silence me was a reminder that for some Muslim men, a conversation among the \u201ccommunity\u201d was another way of saying that it was a conversation led and conducted by \u2014 and for \u2014 men only.As a feminist of Egyptian and Muslim descent, my life\u2019s work has been informed by the belief that religion and culture must never be used to justify the subjugation of women. I can write about my culture and religion because I am a product of both. Even when I\u2019m accused of giving ammunition to the Islamophobic right, in the struggle between \u201ccommunity\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d I always choose the women. It is exhausting that Muslim women\u2019s voices and our bodies are reduced to proxy battlefields by the demonizers and defenders of Muslim men. Neither side cares about women. They are concerned only with one another.Earlier this year, a Muslim man \u2014 a stranger \u2014 emailed to chastise me for my views on sex, which he labeled un-Islamic. He hid behind the phrase, \u201cDear Sister, I say these things with greatest certitude of your Islam.\u201d So I asked fellow Muslim women on Twitter to use the hashtag #DearSister to share their experience of being lectured to and reprimanded by Muslim men.It is incredible what happens when Muslim women are asked to speak for themselves. Within 24 hours, #DearSister was used more than 18,000 times by women from Australia to Pakistan, Nigeria to Malaysia and South Africa to Canada.Predictably, both the rock and the hard place tried to hijack the voices of those Muslim women. The Islamophobic right said the women would be better off if they left Islam. The Muslim men warned the women that Islamophobes would use their complaints against Muslim men.But the women weren\u2019t deterred. They continued to insist that they could speak for themselves, with power and humor.\u201cWhen conservative values prevent us from talking about sex openly, how can we speak about sexual violence?\u201c the Nigerian journalist Kadaria Ahmed told me.Islamophobia and racism are real. Attempts to silence Muslim women \u201cfor the sake of the community\u201d are real. But justice is far more important. We must not further shame Muslim women by expecting them to constantly defend our men.The answer to her question is this: While Tariq Ramadan\u2019s accusers deserve justice and the scholar must be allowed to defend himself, we must not lose this watershed moment to a squabbling match between the demonizers and defenders of Muslim men.Muslim women \u2014 like all women \u2014 have every right to a commanding voice in this moment of opportunity to expose patriarchy\u2019s crimes.Mona Eltahawy (@monaeltahawy) is the author of \u201cHeadscarves and Hymens: Why the Middle East Needs a Sexual Revolution\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Emily Steel, a media reporter for The Times in New York, discussed the tech she is using.This sounds completely old-fashioned, but the most important tech tool for all of my reporting really has been the telephone. I\u2019ve spoken with dozens upon dozens of sources, many of whom are hesitant to talk about their experiences or may even be barred from sharing information with me. I\u2019ve found that talking over the phone \u2014 and even better meeting in person \u2014 helps to build trust and establish a relationship.What do you like about Signal, and what could be better?I love how easy the app is to use. It is very similar to chatting via iMessage. You basically download and go.That being said, a couple of areas could use some improvement. The calling function is sometimes spotty. And it also would be nice to know whether someone has taken a screenshot of a message if it is set to disappear after viewing.Right now, we\u2019re seeing a very competitive race among the streaming services as they all attempt to distinguish themselves to consumers. One way to do that is through opening up their checkbooks and ramping up the investment in original programming. The money is flowing!Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?I\u2019m getting married next year, so during breaks in reporting I am deep in the world of wedding planning. I\u2019ve found that a lot of the wedding websites and apps are completely overwhelming. I\u2019m signed into one that put more than 100 items on my to-do list!But my fianc\u00e9, Dan, and I also have managed to find some cool sites and apps that have streamlined the process and allowed us to add some of our own personal touches.One was a site called Postable, which allowed us to quickly collect our guests\u2019 addresses and update our address book before sending out our save-the-dates. It was much easier than a series of emails and texts requesting people\u2019s details.After a bit of research, we also used the site Minted to turn a photo of Dan\u2019s artwork into a save-the-date postcard. It turned out great! (We also built a wedding website with Minted.)Like many brides, I\u2019ve also spent an extraordinary amount of time on Pinterest, collecting and curating ideas. Our amazing florist has created a special board to help us brainstorm flowers for the big day.And my other favorite technology of the moment is the app called 1 Second Everyday, which creates a video diary out of one-second video clips. Dan and I thought it would be a special way to track the year before our wedding.Before I worked at The Times, I wrote pretty extensively about the pervasiveness of online tracking technologies. As a result, I\u2019m fairly cautious about what technologies, apps and services I use. Even though Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google Home have taken off in the past year, I don\u2019t want a device that can listen to me all the time in my home. But I did want to be able to turn the lights on and off on command, so I bought an old-fashioned Clapper. It\u2019s a little temperamental, but I still love it!As a media reporter, what is your media setup at home? Are you a cord cutter?Because I\u2019m in front of a screen all day, I try to unplug a bit when I\u2019m at home.

However, officials there had already been considering writing Mr. Tambor off the show \u2014 in which he plays the lead character, Maura Pfefferman, a transgender woman \u2014 in response to the allegations.Van Barnes, a former assistant to Mr. Tambor, wrote in a private Facebook post this month that he had sexually harassed and groped her. Amazon officials opened an investigation, and Jill Soloway, the creator of \u201cTransparent,\u201d said she and others on the show were cooperating with it.Soon after, the actress Trace Lysette came forward publicly, saying that Mr. Tambor had \u201cmade many sexual advances and comments\u201d and, on one occasion, physically assaulted her between takes for a scene in which both actors were wearing pajamas.At the time, Ms. Lysette said, she laughed and brushed off the episode \u2014 because Mr. Tambor was the star of the show and she had to work with him, and because she was accustomed to such mistreatment. \u201cGiven the journey and circumstances of my life, I was used to being treated as a sexual object by men,\u201d wrote Ms. Lysette, who is a transgender woman. \u201cThis one just happened to be famous.\u201d\u201cI know I haven\u2019t always been the easiest person to work with,\u201d he said. \u201cI can be volatile and ill-tempered, and too often I express my opinions harshly and without tact.

But then he did: \u201cI made the Cecil iconic!\u201d he declared.On a Monday night a week after his residency began, Mr. Johnson was laughing and cooking before cameras and a boom microphone as Phil Rosenthal, the creator of \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond,\u201d interviewed the chef for his new Netflix food and travel show, \u201cSomebody Feed Phil.\u201d\u201cThey could have picked any chef in the world, and they picked me,\u201d Mr. Johnson crowed.On his Chefs Club menu, rice makes more than one appearance, and rises to a star attraction in the form of \u201ccon\u2019con,\u201d a dish of jollof sticky rice about the size of a moon pie, sweetened with coconut and topped with an eggplant curry and basil. It exudes comfort and grandeur at once.Mr. Parsons said diners from outside Harlem were reluctant to trek during the week to the restaurant, at the corner of St. Nicholas Avenue and West 118th Street. And the menu was \u201ctoo exotic,\u201d he added, for the Cecil to become a weeknight habit for neighborhood residents.\u201cYou\u2019re not actually looking for a cinnamon-dusted guinea fried hen with piri-piri rice on the side,\u201d he said.Mr. Smalls, who remains an owner but had no hand in the new steakhouse menu, disagreed, blaming poor management and a business plan that he said failed to adequately adjust when a planned lunchtime seating never materialized.As the owners tinkered to find the right formula, the restaurants closed, then reopened. Caught in the middle was Mr. Johnson, who started out as chef de cuisine of the Cecil and ended up as executive chef of both restaurants. The job, though, came with little autonomy.Mr. Johnson, 33, said he needed to lay a foundation for himself; his wife, Samiyyah Chapman; and their 3-month-old twins. He told his bosses he wanted a bigger role and more restaurants.\u201cWhen they said to me they really didn\u2019t want to do anything else, I had to go look in the mirror and say, \u2018Would I be content here working for the next 10 years?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, I don\u2019t mean to sound cocky, but I\u2019m just better than that.\u201d He resigned in June.Mr. Johnson has forged ahead alone in other ventures. He was trying to persuade Stephane De Baets, a founder and the president of Chefs Club, to invest in Ingrained Hospitality when another idea came to Mr. De Baets. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come do a pop-up to show me first your cuisine?\u201d Mr. De Baets recalled asking him.That success led to the longer stay at Chefs Club, a cavernous space with an open kitchen where diners can watch the chefs in action.Mr. Johnson has filled the menu with brightly colored dishes and flavors, seen most obviously in a shared plate of cornmeal-crusted sea bass, seasoned with turmeric, that takes up an entire bowl and leaves just enough room for purple sweet potatoes, roasted carrots, papaya and long beans.A few dishes, like udon noodles with braised goat, and piri-piri prawns, have followed Mr. Johnson to Chefs Club from the Cecil. His favorite dessert is a rice milk pop of raspberry and hibiscus with crispy puffed rice drizzled on top.At Chefs Club, Mr. Johnson also did something he could never do at the Cecil: He put his name on it, placing the neon letters \u201cJJ\u201d in the window. He also required the restaurant to play his days-long soundtrack, which he commissioned a D.J. to compile. On a recent night, several diners bobbed their heads and swayed in their seats.Music plays as much of a role in dining as food, Mr. Johnson said, recalling how his Puerto Rican grandmother played salsa while she prepared sofrito and plantain dumplings, and how his black American grandmother, raised in the Rocky Mountains, played Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Earth Wind & Fire as she made cherry pies and traditional Southern food.His taste runs to \u201890s neo-soul and hip-hop. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the diaspora,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I feel like black artists were having the best times in their careers. They were able to really put their music out. Like Biggie, Tupac, Wu-Tang, Mariah, Erykah Badu, they were talking about real stuff that was happening in our lives.\u201dFor $360, a diner can have everything on the menu in a tasting that Mr. Johnson calls \u201cIt Was All a Dream,\u201d a nod to The Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s \u201cJuicy.\u201d\u201cThis is a dream for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI get to the cook the food of who I am and listen to the music that I want to listen to.\u201dMr. Johnson said he also wants to create jobs and hire people who look like him. His give-back attitude appears to come from his parents, Marcela Johnson, a retired teacher, and Joe Johnson, a bookkeeper who still runs a youth basketball program in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, where they raised their son and his younger sister. The family traveled on vacation to Barbados, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and North Carolina \u2014 trips that, in reflection, helped him see the African diaspora firsthand.Though Mr. Johnson excelled in a variety of sports, including skiing, basketball and soccer, he wanted to be a chef. His mother insisted that, despite the expense, he study at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. After graduating, he worked in New York at Tribeca Grill and the Smith, then as a personal chef and later in an executive dining room at Morgan Stanley.In 2011, as a contestant on \u201cRocco\u2019s Dinner Party,\u201d a Bravo reality TV show hosted by the chef Rocco DiSpirito, Mr. Johnson wooed the judges with a dish of smothered shrimp and grits.The meal caught the eye of Mr. Smalls, a South Carolina native, who said Mr. Johnson reminded him of his father, who would prepare the same Lowcountry dish for special occasions. Mr. Smalls reached out to Mr. Johnson, and they developed a teacher-apprentice relationship. Mr. Johnson accompanied Mr. Smalls on educational trip to Ghana, and that led to the job at the Cecil.Saying the food was amazing, Mr. Ozersky told Mr. Smalls, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame you won\u2019t get credit for it.\u201dMr. Smalls remembered pushing back. \u201cIt\u2019s not important that I\u2019m the person that\u2019s cooking the food and most remembered for it. It\u2019s important that it\u2019s remembered,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I did something right in selecting a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who is going to make that a platform, then I ain\u2019t mad.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Reich, a Multiplatform Gadfly, Comes to Netflix", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAsked to pick a spot for lunch to discuss the new Netflix documentary, \u201cSaving Capitalism,\u201d a representative for Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, proposed Bobby Van\u2019s Steakhouse, across the street from the New York Stock Exchange.It was an odd choice. Mr. Reich, the pugnacious economist and ardent critic of income inequality, has spent his career railing against Wall Street and what he sees as its corrosive influence on American society. Bobby Van\u2019s is a watering hole for investment bankers and stock traders.Nonetheless, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 lit up as soon as Mr. Reich walked in the door. \u201cI love your posts on Facebook,\u201d said the host, a barrel-chested man wearing a power suit and pink tie. \u201cI watch you on MSNBC all the time. Keep up the good work, Dr. Reich.\u201dTwo decades removed from his position in the Clinton cabinet, Mr. Reich, 71, is a multi-platform attack dog of the far left, a verbose gadfly who can be counted on to deliver withering critiques of Republicans, Democrats, lobbyists, lawyers and even former colleagues.His newfound social media acumen seems only to have made him more quarrelsome. He has more than a half million followers on Twitter, where he posts a daily fusillade of indignant tweets aimed at President Trump.But where the French economist Thomas Piketty brings an academic distance to his writing on inequality and Senator Bernie Sanders channels a righteous indignation in the political realm, Mr. Reich comes across as exactly what he is \u2014 a frumpy, sometimes pedantic professor from the University of California at Berkeley, eager to lecture anyone who will listen about our broken financial world.\u201cThe central thesis of the book and the movie is that the game really is rigged,\u201d he said over a small garden salad, which he ordered as an entree.That thesis, presented with a look of grave concern, makes for an easy sound bite, but it can be hard to prove. Yet Mr. Reich gives it a try in \u201cSaving Capitalism,\u201d which was directed by Jacob Kornbluth, who also directed Mr. Reich\u2019s previous film, \u201cInequality for All.\u201d\u201dSaving Capitalism\u201d follows Mr. Reich on a journey around the country as he talks to rural voters, politicians and small business owners. Along the way, using historical footage and animations, he explains what he says has been the systematic takeover of the legislative process by corporations and the wealthy.Though the Powell Memo surely wasn\u2019t the only reason, lobbyists began flooding Washington, and over the last 50 years, he said, many laws have been enacted that favor corporations and the wealthy.For Mr. Reich, these episodes and countless others he can cite are proof that lawmakers are more often than not looking out for the interests of corporations, not voters. \u201cWith great wealth has also come great political power,\u201d he said. \u201cWealth buys everything from tax breaks, to bailouts, to subsidies, to laws that on their face look to be neutral, but actually help particular companies or industries or wealthy people.\u201dThis is a sorry state of affairs, he suggests, and one that wasn\u2019t inevitable. Democratic presidents could have embraced labor law reform and made it easier to form unions, he said. Politicians, workers and investors could have pushed back against the corporate raiders in the 1980s, who glorified short-term profits and made enormous personal fortunes. And the government could have resisted the push to deregulate Wall Street.Putting the genie back in the bottle won\u2019t be easy, though. As convincing as he is in making his case against the flaws in our current version of capitalism, Mr. Reich is less so when it comes to prescribing a remedy. He comes prepared with a laundry list of progressive pipe dreams. Get big money out of elections. Stop the revolving door between government and industry groups. End gerrymandering of voting districts. Raise the minimum wage.Yet for any of these to happen, Democrats would have to start winning more elections. And at the end of the Netflix film, he implores viewers to organize and vote. He knows it won\u2019t be easy, but he says the alternative is bleak. \u201cIf we\u2019re not vigilant, we will lose our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public is waking up to that fact.\u201dIf it all sounds familiar, it is because Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders and even Donald J. Trump have appealed to disaffected workers in recent presidential campaigns.\u201cThe country is catching up with him,\u201d Darrell West, vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said of Mr. Reich. \u201cFor a long time he was preaching in the wilderness. Now there\u2019s a closer fit between his critique and how ordinary people view the world.\u201d\u201cWe are on the way to becoming a two-tiered society, composed of a few winners, and a larger group of Americans left behind, whose anger and whose disillusionment is easily manipulated,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce unbottled, mass resentment can poison the very fabric of society, the moral integrity of a society, replacing ambition with envy, replacing tolerance with hate.\u201dCaptured in \u201cSaving Capitalism,\u201d Mr. Reich\u2019s remarks, made 23 years ago, could have just as easily been spoken today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Pass-Throughs vs. Corporations \u2014 Who\u2019s the Bigger Winner?", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here are some of the stories we are watching. \u2022 One of the biggest German IPOs in years could arrive next year.Pass-throughs have a lower total tax burden than corporations do. That advantage exists now and remains in both the House and Senate versions of the tax bill.The key point here is that corporations and their investors are taxed twice:First, a corporate rate on profits is paid directly by the company. Under current law, the top rate is 35 percent. Then, when the business pays returns to its investors, they pay tax on the money they\u2019ve earned when they file in April. That income \u2014 dividends and capital gains \u2014 is taxed at a top rate of 23.8 percent.Pass-through businesses, meanwhile, are taxed just once:These are small and mammoth partnerships, proprietorships and companies with fewer than 100 shareholders known as S corporations... They aren\u2019t subjected to any separate business tax, but pay on their individual income tax when the money thrown off by the business is passed through to its owners. The rate depends on what bracket someone is in, but the highest is 39.6 percent.So while the corporate rate by itself may be lower than the top pass-through rate, the total tax burden on corporations is higher.But even in Republican rewrite of the tax code \u2014 in which the corporate rate is lowered to 20 percent \u2014 pass-throughs still come out on top. That again is because corporation are taxed twice.Six months ago, Don Blankenship \u2014 the former C.E.O. of Massey Energy and once one of the most-feared men in the coal industry \u2014 shed his label as federal inmate 12393-088.Now Mr. Blankenship, who was convicted of crimes related to the explosion at the Massey-run Upper Big Branch mine in 2010 that killed 29 men, is pursuing a new career: senator.One thing Mr. Blankenship won\u2019t have a problem with is name recognition: He\u2019s one of the best-known figures in West Virginia, both for his decade-long tenure as the C.E.O. of Massey and then for his downfall after the mine explosion.Mr. Blankenship\u2019s quasi-dictatorial management style as chief executive produced spectacular results for Massey, transforming it from a relatively modest business dominated by a single family into a corporation that operated more than 150 mines and brought in more than $2.6 billion in revenue.Mr. Blankenship was eventually convicted of having deliberately skirted federal mining safety requirements. It\u2019s a charge he has consistently denied, and he has called himself an \u201cAmerican political prisoner.\u201dThere has certainly been a lot of talk about media mergers in recent weeks.But all this news may have obscured the fact that media deal making has slowed markedly this year. So far in 2017, the value of announced media deals in 2017 is down 69 percent in the United States from a year ago and 57 percent globally, according to Thomson Reuters.The total volume of these deals is at its lowest level since 2013 in the United States and 2012 worldwide.Few, for example, believe that Comcast \u2014 which is in discussions to buy significant portions of 21st Century Fox \u2014 would be allowed to complete that potential deal unless the Justice Department was defeated in its AT&T lawsuit.So until there is a conclusion to the AT&T-Time Warner deal, big media acquisitions are likely on hold.Their shared goals: Expand Kind from being a snack maker into a health-food empire, and expand its international sales.\u201cJob No. 1 is taking it global.

{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Repeal: What Could Happen and How It Could Affect You", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s our guide for internet users looking for answers.The net neutrality rules were passed in 2015 during the Obama administration when Democrats controlled the F.C.C.The major broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast have argued that utility-style regulation represents unnecessary government meddling that will reduce their incentives to invest and improve service. The result, they say, will be worse service for everyone in the long run.The biggest concern is that the internet will become pay-to-play technology with two tiers: one that has speedy service and one that doesn\u2019t. The high-speed lane would be occupied by big internet and media companies, and affluent households. For everyone else there would be the slow lane.The brand-name internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, analysts say, will comfortably be able to pay the higher rent. It will not affect their business, though it may crimp their profits. Avoiding higher prices is one reason the major internet companies have been champions of net neutrality.That will no longer be true, Mr. Bell wrote, without net neutrality rules that \u201censure that anyone who puts something on the internet has a fair shot at finding a life-changing audience.\u201dThe government-backed guarantee of equal access is why public interest groups, nongovernmental organizations, charities and millions of private citizens wrote to the F.C.C. in support of the net neutrality rules.But the broadband and telecom companies \u2014 and some economists \u2014 say that the freedom to charge different prices for different products and services is vital to healthy markets. That kind of \u201cprice discrimination,\u201d they say, is the fuel of innovation and efficiency.In a public comment earlier this year to the F.C.C., AT&T called the Obama-era rules \u201can unprecedented regulatory overreach for which there is no economic or marketplace justification.\u201dThe F.C.C. rules mandated net neutrality principles under a utility-style telecommunications law, called Title 2, that dates to 1934. The carriers fear that it all but ensures price regulation.\u201cWhat they really object to is Title 2, not the net neutrality principles,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an independent analyst.Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who is credited with coining the phrase \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d said the repeal plan not only rolls back the Obama-era rules, it goes further. It specifically permits broadband carriers to block media content, Mr. Wu said, an added power which was not the case during the administration of George W. Bush.\u201cAn allowance of blocking is really pretty shocking.\u201d Mr. Wu said in an email.Yet if government is in retreat, then consumers are left to trust the behavior of the internet-access companies like Charter and AT&T. In their filings with the F.C.C., the companies have claimed that faith would be well founded. Market incentives, Charter told the F.C.C., push the companies to provide the best service to its customers, catering to consumer demand.Charter said it voluntarily adheres to net neutrality principles, and will continue to do so. \u201cWe do not block, throttle, or otherwise interfere with the online activity of our customers,\u201d the company said.But a weakness in the free-market argument, industry analysts say, is that in some regional and rural markets, households have only one internet provider available to them. That undermines the theory that competition will protect consumers.Roger L. Kay, an independent technology analyst, predicted that larger bills \u2014 not content blocking \u2014 would be the most likely result. If the big internet and media companies will have to pay their carriers more for high-speed services, the expenses will trickle down to households.Consumers, Mr. Kay said, \u201cwill end up paying higher prices for essentially the same service.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No one escapes unscathed: Among the tales of teenage terror are the night that Andrew (John Mulaney) ejaculates while slow-dancing with a girl and the day Jessi (Jessi Klein) gets her period during a class trip to the Statue of Liberty \u2014 in white shorts, no less.In a call from Buenos Aires, where he is shooting Chris Weitz\u2019s \u201cOperation Finale,\u201d about the hunt for Adolf Eichmann, Mr. Kroll discussed some of his own coming-of-age embarrassments. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.What\u2019s your most humiliating puberty story?I got \u201cpantsed\u201d in seventh grade. But my underwear came down as well, and my penis was exposed to the girl that I had my crush on. I hadn\u2019t hit puberty, so it was a bald little cashew. That definitely had a lasting effect.You\u2019ve called this the most autobiographical of all your shows. So many of the feelings and emotions that I was going through at 12 and 13 have become the DNA of the rest of my life. I\u2019ve been in therapy for a long time and found that things I was talking about I would then use in building the character of Nick, and vice versa.When did you start puberty?I got my first pubic hair when I was going into high school, so about 14-ish. I was very small and gregarious and, I think, a likable kid. Then when I hit puberty, I became much more temperamental and explosive, and my parents were taken aback. I also grew probably 10 inches in high school, to a strapping 140 pounds.How did your parents cope?I was the youngest of four, and my mom\u2019s way to handle it was very straightforward, like, \u201cA boy\u2019s nipples will become engorged, and those are all secondary sex characteristics.\u201d Her way of demystifying it weirdly had the effect of me staring at my friends\u2019 nipples and being like, \u201cI guess he\u2019s probably going through puberty.\u201d And it left me more aware of what wasn\u2019t happening to me.A lot of these lessons are quite sensitive. How about the episode in which Andrew wonders if he\u2019s gay because he gets an erection when he looks at the Rock?The impetus was kids figuring out their sexuality. You get sexually excited by different things, and you don\u2019t exactly know what that means or why something is titillating. At that age, people have friends that they\u2019re incredibly close with and they\u2019re trying to parse what that means. And I think we can all agree that, however you want to identify sexually, the Rock is inherently an attractive person.Are you working with a sex-ed expert? Peggy Orenstein wrote \u201cGirls & Sex\u201d; that was a major influence on [our desire] to give equal weight to the experience that girls have. In the fifth episode, Jessi has a conversation with her vagina, voiced by Kristen Wiig. It\u2019s been amazing that Peggy has since reached out to us on Twitter, and we\u2019ve got a little dialogue going.John Mulaney also co-starred in your Broadway hit, \u201cOh, Hello.\u201d Have we seen the last of Gil and George?If Gil and George have their druthers, we\u2019ll be in Branson, Mo., at Yacov Smirnoff\u2019s theater doing \u201cOh, Hello 2\u201d soon. [Silence on both ends] I\u2019m joking, of course.[We shot the episode around] my birthday, and spending the day playing with her was the best birthday present I could ask for. I got there, and they were like, \u201cHow would you feel about having pepperoni nipples?\u201d I was ready to say yes to anything.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blood, Sweat, Toil and Tears: Playing Churchill on Screen", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWinston Churchill was a complex and contradictory leader unlike any in recent history. And he also presents one of the most sought-after and challenging roles for any actor worth his salt.\u201cHe could pitch. He could bat. He could run,\u201d Gary Oldman said in a recent interview. \u201cHe\u2019s the ultimate all-rounder.\u201dCountless movies have been made about Churchill, but Mr. Wright was drawn to this particular period because of what that uncertainty revealed about the man. \u201cI was fascinated by the portrayal of Churchill as a human being,\u201d Mr. Wright said. \u201cHe\u2019s become such an icon that he\u2019s either untouchable or he\u2019s a demon. To take him down from his perch and not throw him in the gutter but look at him eye to eye\u201d was the appeal for him.The movie also tries to understand Churchill through his use of language, with the sound of typewriters constantly clacking in the background. \u201cThey are the most iconic speeches in the history of the English language and they were all written in 28 days, so how these speeches came to be and how he came to express the will and the sentiment of the nation is really the subject,\u201d Mr. Wright added.In one of the most stirring scenes, Churchill famously addresses the House of Commons, arguing that the British need to face the Nazi threat at all costs: \u201cIf we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, \u2018This was their finest hour.\u2019\u201dSpeaking those words is a dream for actors, but the role also represents an enormous risk, Mr. Oldman said, where you could easily slip into caricature. \u201cHe\u2019s quite often portrayed as old, grumpy, a curmudgeon. Lugubrious and grunting and shouting,\u201d Mr. Oldman said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019ve seen him played and I think that contaminated my own thinking about him.\u201dTo get at the man beneath those cigar-puffing, jowly stereotypes, enhanced by makeup, Mr. Oldman spent four months researching and preparing for the role \u2014 watching footage, reading his many works and those of biographers like Martin Gilbert and even the politician Boris Johnson. He visited Churchill\u2019s family homes, Chartwell and Blenheim Palace, and talked to people who knew him. \u201cI discovered a man who was not as fat as we all thought he was in 1940 and who had really an athletic tread. He skipped around and he had this sort of stoop and it was forward moving,\u201d Mr. Oldman said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s a real twinkle in the eye, and he has humor. The Churchill I saw and I discovered had charm.\u201dMr. Oldman also spent time in the war rooms in Westminster where those fateful decisions were made, and sat in the great man\u2019s chair. \u201cOn the left-hand arm of the chair were these marks where he had made scratches with his nails,\u201d the actor recalled. \u201cAnd on the right-hand side were scratches from his ring that he used to wear. He was in this chair throughout the war, so you can imagine the stress and strain that he was under.\u201dWhat many people now fail to realize, he added, is \u201chow precariously close he came to disaster\u201d and that he was himself resistant to war. \u201cHis most powerful and beautiful words were about the horror of war.\u201dWith \u201cDarkest Hour,\u201d Mr. Oldman now joins a long line of actors who have played Churchill, including Albert Finney, Richard Burton and even a satire featuring Christian Slater.

More rewardingly, she goes into the future, where Maria finds herself making a streaming series much like the one we\u2019re watching.Mostly, though, she\u2019s in the show\u2019s present, where Maria\u2019s relationship with Scott (Olafur Darri Olafsson) has reached the point of cohabitation. The lessons of Season 1 may have been that fear and mental illness never go away, but now they play out in milder, cuter and more legible ways, with more clearly defined messages but less wild inventiveness in the telling.Maria has to accept Scott\u2019s poor money-management skills and trust that he\u2019s not robbing her; he has to accept her wild-animal household habits and trust that she\u2019s taking her meds. Maria reassures him with one of the straight-up public-service-style pronouncements she frequently makes: \u201cI was getting irritable. And defensive. But those aren\u2019t always signs of hypomania. They\u2019re normal human emotions.\u201dWith a few exceptions \u2014 a sudden shift into wide-screen proportions for a few moments of horror-movie sendup, a laugh track that turns three talking raccoons into retro sitcom characters \u2014 this material is handled relatively straightforwardly, at least compared to the constant, riotous formal experimentation of the first season.But the show goes even more meta than before in the \u201cfuture\u201d sequences \u2014 the time frame is loosely established by a reference to the yet-to-exist \u201cWestworld\u201d Season 3 \u2014 in which Maria gets the chance to \u201cdestigmatize mental illness forever\u201d with a series called \u201cMaria Bamford Is Nuts!\u201d Invited to a meeting at Muskvision, a streaming service allegedly owned by the car-and-space mogul Elon Musk, Maria is scanned by a white cube that approves a 13-episode season without hearing her pitch. \u201cThis content will fulfill many quadrants of our algorithm,\u201d the cube tells her, a determination presumably already made by Netflix in the real world.There are always hurdles in the world of \u201cLady Dynamite,\u201d however, and Maria is soon told that she should \u201ctone down\u201d the mental-health issues. This offers the most promising possibilities going forward, as well as the primary venue for Ana Gasteyer\u2019s essential performance as Maria\u2019s divinely foul-mouthed agent.It\u2019s not clear from these early episodes that Ms. Bamford has a whole lot more to say about the compounding difficulties of mental illness and the vicissitudes of life as a woman trying to succeed in the entertainment business and navigate romance in Los Angeles. \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d is still a well-made and distinctive comedy, but there are a lot of those these days.Advertisement"}

Her son had told Mr. Spacey that he was 21, she said, though he was only 18.\u201cBut,\u201d said Ms. Unruh, regardless of her son\u2019s age, \u201cKevin Spacey had no right to sexually assault him. There was no consent.\u201d She said she hoped the actor would go to jail.Mr. Spacey and his spokesman did not immediately reply to email messages seeking comment on Wednesday.Ms. Unruh said that she discussed the incident informally with the sheriff of Nantucket, Mass., last summer shortly after hearing her son\u2019s account, but only last week did her son officially report the matter to the Nantucket police, who are conducting an investigation. She said her son also \u201chanded over evidence,\u201d which she declined to describe.Her son, now a sophomore in college, did not attend the news conference. Ms. Unruh said they decided to go public now because the climate had changed after accusations of sexual assault and harassment against Harvey Weinstein and because victims of sexual misconduct were no longer being blamed.Mitchell Garabedian, who is representing Ms. Unruh\u2019s son and who joined her at the news conference, said that the allegation against Mr. Spacey was \u201cwell within the statute of limitations\u201d for a civil claim and \u201calso within the criminal statute of limitations.\u201d They are now considering their legal options.Describing the incident, which she said took place at the Club Car restaurant and bar on Nantucket in July 2016, Ms. Unruh said: \u201cKevin Spacey brought him drink after drink after drink and when my son was drunk, Spacey made his move and sexually assaulted him.\u201dShe said the room was crowded and dimly lit. After Mr. Spacey grabbed him, her son shifted his body to try to remove the hand, then he froze, Ms. Unruh said.\u201cKevin Spacey insisted he come with him to a private after-hours party to drink even more,\u201d Ms. Unruh said. When Mr. Spacey left to go to the bathroom, a woman who had seen that the son was shaken came to his side and \u201ctold him to run and he did.\u201d\u201cHe ran as fast as he could all the way to his grandmother\u2019s house,\u201d his mother said, where he told his sister what had happened.

Comcast shares increased 1 percent.Until last week, most analysts believed that the Murdochs had no interest in selling any component of 21st Century Fox. In fact, attention recently has focused on their efforts to make it larger: James Murdoch, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, has been trying to gain regulatory approval to buy control of Sky, the European satellite behemoth.Disney and Fox are no longer talking, for now.Verizon had expressed preliminary interest, according to people briefed on the matter, though one of them added that the company is not currently interested in pursuing a deal.This is all happening as the traditional media industry scrambles to contend with a struggling film business and sputtering cable networks, which have been buffeted by viewership declines and subscriber erosion. At the same time, streaming services like Netflix are surging and tech giants like Apple have arrived in Hollywood.To compete, big players like the Walt Disney Company and Comcast have been looking to get even bigger. (Disney recently paid $2.5 billion for BamTech, a video streaming company, and said it would introduce a pair of Netflix-style streaming services.) Small conglomerates like Discovery and Scripps Media have sought refuge in each other\u2019s arms.Comcast spent about $17 billion in 2013 for control of NBCUniversal. In 2016, Comcast spent $3.8 billion for DreamWorks.The overseas operations of 21st Century Fox would be most interesting to Comcast, analysts said, but other assets would also complement NBCUniversal\u2019s holdings, including a nature channel, National Geographic, and movie properties that could fuel its theme parks.Advertisement"}

But not everybody.\u201dIt also suggests why an actress of Ms. Thurman\u2019s starry rank, with only one previous professional theater credit, will be onstage for every second of every scene as Chloe, a chic pleasure-seeker with a workaholic husband and a carousel of lovers.With a career spent trying \u201cto be decent and work hard\u201d amid what she described as Hollywood\u2019s \u201ccontempt and dismissiveness toward women of all kinds,\u201d it comes as a relief to find a role like this one.Yet even this opportunity has been shadowed by outside forces: the allegations of sexual assault and harassment against the Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein, who produced several of Ms. Thurman\u2019s movies, and the accusations of sexual misconduct against Kevin Spacey, the star of Mr. Willimon\u2019s Netflix show.After a full day of rehearsal in heels, Ms. Thurman had arrived at the Japanese restaurant late, winded from a steeplechase through tourist-crammed Midtown. She looked like an Olympian goddess in her off hours, a goddess with a rumpled scarf, tousled hair and an immediate need to phone her teenage son and check in on his soccer game. (She has two older children, including that soccer-playing son, with her ex-husband, Ethan Hawke, and a younger daughter with her former fianc\u00e9 Arpad Busson.)\u201cI\u2019ve definitely reached that point of such complete maximum preoccupation that I\u2019m just trying to keep up,\u201d she said.She wanted to know what Broadway had to offer. And not just Broadway, Ms. Thurman said. \u201cAny theater.\u201dMs. MacKinnon sent the script, and Ms. Thurman felt instantly drawn to Chloe, the Parisian woman of the title. (Chloe is actually American. Long story.) She admired Chloe\u2019s \u201cemancipation and her sense of entitlement, of sexual freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sheer confidence of the character.\u201dChloe is a flirt and a schemer, a dilettante and a high-heeled brawler, a woman of appetite.Another coffee date was arranged, this time with Mr. Willimon, who described the meeting as a \u201chey, let\u2019s get to know each other to make sure that we don\u2019t hate each other\u2019s guts.\u201d Ms. Thurman brought the script, already studded with questions and notes.As Ms. MacKinnon said, \u201cChloe has movie star charisma.\u201d So it\u2019s pretty helpful that Ms. Thurman is already a movie star.Plays, however, were Ms. Thurman\u2019s first taste of acting. As a sophomore at her Massachusetts boarding school, she played the female lead in \u201cThe Crucible.\u201d More than 30 years later, there was swagger in her throaty voice when she said, \u201cIt was an achievement for a sophomore to get the role that usually a senior gets.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t very difficult to cast her,\u201d said Stephen Frears, the director of \u201cDangerous Liaisons,\u201d speaking by telephone. \u201cShe was so striking, so beautiful and so fresh.\u201dShe was also, as Mr. Frears said, \u201cvery formidable.\u201d That\u2019s a hallmark of her career and also maybe a clue to why that career has been so eclectic. Ms. Thurman isn\u2019t a delicate actress or a melting one or the kind who comes right to the front of a movie screen and invites you in. There\u2019s a remove in a lot of her best work (\u201cHenry & June,\u201d \u201cKill Bill\u201d), a sense that she has emotions and ideas that are hers alone.She has refused to be typecast as a siren or a femme fatale and has struggled to find roles that attract her. It isn\u2019t that she won\u2019t play wives and girlfriends \u2014 she will, she has. But these are women as likely to steal a scene as to yield to it.Quentin Tarantino, who directed her as a gangster\u2019s wife in \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and wrote the \u201cKill Bill\u201d movies for her, compared Ms. Thurman to golden-age luminaries like Greta Garbo and Bette Davis. \u201cThere\u2019s this year\u2019s blonde and there\u2019s last year\u2019s blonde. Interchangeable. But to me, Uma has a quality that could rank with a Marlene Dietrich,\u201d he said in a phone interview. He also called her, with affection, \u201ca big, tall willow.\u201dDid the tone of the responses surprise her? \u201cI don\u2019t expect anyone to pat me on the back,\u201d she said. That script, a series of rhymed couplets barnacled with topical quips, \u201cwas so impenetrably difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was madness.\u201dIn late October, the allegations against Mr. Spacey also surfaced and production on \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d was halted. (Mr. Willimon left the series in 2016.)Though \u201cThe Parisian Woman\u201d traffics in questions of sex and power, any discussion of these real-world events \u201cnever made its way into the rehearsal room,\u201d Ms. MacKinnon said firmly.Inside that room, a few days before the actors were to move into the theater for technical rehearsals, Ms. Thurman clacked onto the temporary set in teal heels, prop phone in her hand, gemstone glint in her eye. With mischief and languor, she subdued her lover (Marton Csokas) and teased her husband (Josh Lucas). (Mischief extended to her downtime, too. When this reporter slunk into the room, Ms. Thurman called brightly, \u201cWrite some fake news for us today!\u201d)The blocking for the scene wasn\u2019t set yet; the pacing juddered. But when Ms. Thurman lobbed a line like, \u201cI can\u2019t control who falls in love with me,\u201d it landed.Ms. MacKinnon occasionally stopped the action to offer a suggestion. Sometimes the suggestions were Ms. Thurman\u2019s. Maybe she could speak an early line more lightly. Maybe she should cross the stage later. She asked Ms. MacKinnon if she could sit during an argument with Mr. Csokas\u2019s character, the better to soothe him. \u201cIt\u2019s physical de-escalation on an oppositional line,\u201d Ms. Thurman explained with typical hyperarticulacy.Rehearsing a play has required some adjustments in the ways she attacks a role. Her method is still what Mr. Tarantino described as motivated by emotional connection to a character and \u201cfrom the inside out,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not surface, right?\u201dBut after decades of telling herself, \u201cEverything better be perfect right now,\u201d she has had to adapt to scenes being built gradually, over days and weeks, rather than knocked together in a couple of hours. She has translated a habit of multiple takes into rehearsal room exploration, playing with different tones and stances.As Ms. MacKinnon said, \u201cShe\u2019ll complete one version and then look at me and say, \u2018Or \u2026\u2019 Then she\u2019ll go back and do it in a completely different way.\u201dAn upside: playing those versions opposite live actors rather than place-holding pieces of tape. \u201cI\u2019ve made whole films with tape,\u201d she said.Eight shows a week can wear an actor down. Yet Ms. Thurman wasn\u2019t too worried about keeping Chloe fresh. In the \u201cKill Bill\u201d movies she\u2019d lived with her character, the Bride, for a year, and still managed to find variation. \u201cActing has never felt routine to me,\u201d she said.Playing Chloe, she said, was taxing her more than any part in a decade. It was forcing her to use all of her actorly muscles \u201cin a more total and protracted way.\u201dIs Chloe a siren? Maybe. A femme fatale? Depends who you ask. Happily, she is more than that, too.As dinner wound down, with plates of vegetables and tiny bowls of tofu littering the table, Ms. Thurman considered the question of what a woman like Chloe really wants. \u201cI think I\u2019m still exploring that,\u201d she said. Finally, she gave what she called \u201ca most banal and bad answer.\u201d\u201cI think she\u2019s wanting and demanding to be fully alive,\u201d Ms. Thurman said.It didn\u2019t sound so terrible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s Comic Timing", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "FeatureHer star turn in \u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019 \u2014 the first major comedic role in her career \u2014 comes at a moment when it\u2019s crucial to reclaim women\u2019s place in stand-up history.Supported byThere is no punch line here: This really happened. When Rachel Brosnahan, who is 27 and not a comic but now plays one on Amazon Prime, walked into her audition for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d she could barely see straight. She was, as she told me, \u201cprobably deathly ill,\u201d but she had no intention of canceling the meeting. For one thing, she had already pushed back her flight once, hoping her illness would abate. Instead, her temperature spiked. The morning of her rescheduled trip, she woke up clammy and disoriented and completely terrified that if she didn\u2019t hurl her body out to Hollywood that day, then Amy Sherman-Palladino and her co-creator (and husband), Daniel Palladino, were going to give the part of Midge Maisel away to the next woman. And she couldn\u2019t let that happen. So, she said, \u201cI flew my ass out to Los Angeles when I probably should not have even been on a plane.\u201dThe thing was, she had a feeling in her bones that Midge was her part. In a world of hamburger roles for television ing\u00e9nues, Midge was a porterhouse. Amy Sherman-Palladino writes her leading ladies \u2014 Lorelai of \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d Michelle Simms on \u201cBunheads\u201d \u2014 as walking winks, verbose descendants of Dorothy Parker, quipping for their lives. And Brosnahan felt that she could truly inhabit Miriam (Midge) Maisel, a young Jewish housewife in 1958 who has finagled the full megillah straight out of Bryn Mawr \u2014 the gleaming Upper West Side apartment, the doting husband who pitches ad copy by day and wears transgressive turtlenecks by night, a toddler and a bouncing baby and a waist that cinches to a Coke-bottle shape in a Perma-lift girdle. (Never mind that Brosnahan is a gentile.)By the end of the first episode, of course, Midge\u2019s idyll crumbles. It has to \u2014 no one wants to watch a show about a merry midcentury homemaker with zero problems. First, she finds out that her husband, Joel, who spends his nights workshopping comedy sets at the Greenwich Village club the Gaslight Caf\u00e9, has been stealing his material from Bob Newhart records. Emasculated, Joel continues to dig: He reveals to Midge that he\u2019s sleeping with his svelte secretary, Penny Pann, and worse, that they\u2019re in love, and he\u2019s packing his bags. After he slinks away, Midge downs a bottle of red wine on the subway, marches through the rain to the famed Gaslight club and winds up onstage, soaking and soused in a pink swing coat. What follows is not so much a comedy set as an act of absurdist outsider art; Midge mocks men coming out of the bathroom, skulks around the stage like a Valkyrie and veers between pathos and one-liners so wildly that the crowd isn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or flee. For a grand finale, her top comes off, the cops are called and she\u2019s hauled off to jail screaming about how \u201cthere\u2019s no [expletive] way that Penny Pann can compete with these tits!\u201dThis meltdown is one of the scenes that Brosnahan had to play during that audition, while she was dizzy and barely lucid. Her illness, it turns out, worked in her favor. She looked slightly damp and deranged the entire time. \u201cI had to take off my shoes at one point because I was sweating so much,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt was a mess. And Amy kept stopping me to tell me to powder my face. I think I may have had a small stroke? I literally don\u2019t remember a single moment of it.\u201dBrosnahan has been an actress on the cusp for a decade \u2014 always just about to break out, about to be the chosen one. It\u2019s not that she hasn\u2019t been noticed. When she was 21 and about to graduate from N.Y.U., she was cast on Netflix\u2019s first series, \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d as Rachel Posner, a high-end escort in Washington who sleeps with a congressman and then is paid off to stay quiet. The role was originally intended for someone older, and Brosnahan was supposed to act in only two episodes. \u201cThey told me I was too young and that I should wear a tighter dress because they had to believe I was a lot older than I was,\u201d she told me. \u201cI thought, Oh, God, I definitely didn\u2019t get this, and they are going to figure out I\u2019m a fraud.\u201dNot only did she get it, but her chemistry with Michael Kelly, who played the presidential chief of staff assigned to handle Posner and who falls for her in the process, was so undeniable that the creators wrote her character from a five-line role into eight episodes in the second season, and then one more episode, in the third, that earned her an Emmy nomination. \u201cMichael used to call my agent after we had scenes together and tell him how much he enjoyed working with me,\u201d she told me.We were walking underneath a giant aqueduct. Brosnahan is petite and put together; that afternoon, she was wearing a striped T-shirt with a fitted motorcycle jacket and a demure pair of black penny loafers. She looked like a preppy mime. For our first meeting, she wanted to see the medieval art at the Cloisters, a short trip north of her apartment in Manhattan, but we both agreed that the day was too warm to spend among dusty tapestries. Instead, she wanted to stroll along the Hudson through the wildflowers. \u201cI really credit Michael as being a huge reason I continued on that show,\u201d she said. There was a fierceness to Brosnahan in the role; even though she was young, she played a political Fantine who was already weathered and wry, as disgusted by the grubby hands of lobbyists as their detractors on the Hill.Her character met a brutal end \u2014 buried somewhere in the wilderness for knowing too much \u2014 but by then Brosnahan already had another TV job. She played Abby Isaacs, the young wife of a physicist in the underrated period drama \u201cManhattan,\u201d about the creation of the atomic bomb. All red lipstick and pin curls and wifely duties, Abby was a hint at what Brosnahan could do with a part like Midge: another woman who loses her innocence, in this case a newcomer to Los Alamos who must slowly come to understand that her husband might help blow up the world. Lila Byock, one of the show\u2019s writers, told me: \u201cI don\u2019t think Rachel ever gave a bad take. And I\u2019m not being hyperbolic. We would watch takes, and it was like, holy [expletive], who is this person? She was about a year older than the actress who was playing a teenager on our show, but it was almost like she walked in fully formed.\u201dUntil Midge, Brosnahan played almost solely dramatic roles. That\u2019s where she feels most comfortable, most in control; as she has discovered, telling jokes involves a level of vulnerability far beyond crying on camera. Luckily, the women whom Sherman-Palladino and Palladino write are all about taut sentences and tight timing; there is nothing elastic about them. Their loose, swingy tempo is entirely preplanned, down to the word (\u201ca monstrous amount of material, and you have to have it down cold,\u201d Brosnahan said). While this rigor may not have worked for a seasoned comedian, someone accustomed to improvisation, Brosnahan took to the constraints right away. She found the bounce inside Midge\u2019s hardness; she snaps the end of her sentences like bubble gum.Sherman-Palladino\u2019s own father, Don Sherman, was a comic right out of the borscht-belt old school. After he died in 2012, she started to think about how she might honor his legacy by telling stories about his world \u2014 Lenny Bruce would come by the house when she was a child, and though her family lived in L.A. by then, she grew up hearing war stories about the New York stand-up scene. She began to think about setting something in the world her father rattled around in, the dank Village clubs of the \u201960s. But instead of following a grizzled comic through the haze of two-drink minimums and chance encounters with Jack Paar, she decided to showcase a much less examined life: that of a normal woman, alone under the hot lights, slinging zingers for pay.\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d has a swirling, magical-realism quality to it. It begins with a wedding \u2014 Midge and Joel\u2019s \u2014 at which, naturally, Midge insists on giving her own toast. She is a woman who has enjoyed every privilege: couture clothes, the full spread at Zabar\u2019s fish counter, a palatial apartment in her parents\u2019 building. One striking scene from the pilot follows Midge as she does her nightly beauty routine, waking up twice in the middle of the night, once to remove her makeup and again to put it back on, so that her husband always wakes up to a perfectly done face. When Joel leaves Midge, the shock is seismic. She has never had to work, or even struggle with her own self-image. This is why her revelations are so primed for comedy: She is a woman who fully believed she deserved the moon, and when her perfect facade disappears, she\u2019s apoplectic and confused and ready to rant.Whenever Midge\u2019s jokes really hit, it is joyful and electric to watch. Women have the right to claim, and reclaim, a place in stand-up comedy history. There were always women working the circuit, even on the borscht belt \u2014 like the 1960s club regular Belle Barth, who sold millions of comedy records. \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d provides a vehicle through which to engage and recover their stories all over again. Because Midge doesn\u2019t start out on a crusade, she almost smuggles progress into the world; like many women navigating midcentury lives, her success is mounted like an undercover operation.The \u201cMaisel\u201d set sits on a cavernous soundstage at Steiner Studios, in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Because Amazon ordered two seasons (the streaming service\u2019s first immediate renewal, based on the strength of the pilot alone), the production designer Bill Groom\u2019s intricate replicas of 1950s New York will stay in place until next spring, when \u201cMaisel\u201d goes back into production. Sherman-Palladino and Palladino wanted to shoot on location as much as possible, but so little of the midcentury metropolis remains intact. The crew hung a scrim the length of a city block painted with apartment buildings at night, each glowing window illuminating a different urban tableau. There is one closed corner of the set, strictly off-limits to outsiders: the box that houses the Gaslight Caf\u00e9. The creators don\u2019t want strangers to watch while Brosnahan is doing stand-up. The only people allowed in are the extras in beatnik dress and a handful of crew members. In early episodes, for sound-editing purposes, she had to deliver her act to a silent crowd.I watched Brosnahan film a domestic scene from the seventh episode, in which she and her pert platinum friend, Imogene, played by Bailey De Young, are stuffing goody bags for a children\u2019s birthday party inside her parents\u2019 posh apartment. The scene was simple enough: Sort toys into bags while gossiping about Midge and Joel\u2019s separation. But the number of props was overwhelming. There were dozens of period-appropriate trinkets \u2014 Tiny Tina baby carriages, Silly Putty, Bazooka Joe \u2014 and the women had to place them into each bag in a precise order, all while firing off rapid, breathless dialogue. It was the final shot of the night, and Brosnahan had already been cinched into a corset for six hours. Her brain was mush, she told me, \u201cbecause we\u2019d already shot 40 pages of dialogue that week,\u201d but she attacked the scene with laser intensity as the two began shuffling knickknacks around.\u201cWait, there\u2019s already gum in here,\u201d Brosnahan, as Midge, said, her forehead crinkling.\u201cI put it in there,\u201d De Young said, playing Imogene slightly ditsy.\u201cI\u2019m doing gum.\u201d\u201cI thought you were doing candy cigarettes.\u201d\u201cStarting over,\u201d Brosnahan sighs, dumping out the gift bags with a loud clatter onto the table.With each take, the two sped up the lines, hands flying. Speak, sigh, pour, speak, sigh, pour, faster and faster. Brosnahan pounced on her lines like a whizzing metronome. Midge is the kind of woman who sets a blistering tempo and waits for the rest of the world to catch up.Rachel Syme is a writer and cultural critic based in New York City.

{"Headline": "Krysten Ritter Spins Her Own Mystery in Her Debut Novel, \u2018Bonfire\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProfileWhen Krysten Ritter was writing her first novel, \u201cBonfire,\u201d about a shady cover-up in small-town America, a plastics company with suspicious motives and a decade-old scandal given new relevance, she understood the genre she was working in.Still, she surprised herself when she finished a first draft of the manuscript and was able to take it all in.\u201cThe book is dark, I am aware,\u201d she said in her natural, deadpan mode. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I was aware how dark until I read the whole thing in one sitting.\u201dBut Ms. Ritter said she also considered the novel \u201can act of pure defiance\u201d: a narrative she wants to see more of, featuring a female protagonist she relates to, made at a time when she was disappointed with other acting opportunities that were offered to her.\u201cI\u2019m not conventional,\u201d Ms. Ritter said over a recent lunch in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. \u201cI try to be raw and vulnerable and gross.\u201d The novel, she said, \u201cwas a way for me to create something for myself \u2014 to take the story back and do what I want to do.\u201dThe protagonist of \u201cBonfire\u201d is Abby Williams, an environmental lawyer in Chicago who returns to her modest hometown of fictional Barrens, Ind., to investigate a case against Optimal Plastics, a conglomerate intertwined in seemingly every aspect of the community.There, while Abby is reacquainted with all that she loved and (mostly) hated about living there, she is drawn back into an unsolved mystery from her high-school days, 10 years earlier, when a group of her teenage tormentors were beset by an unexplained sickness and one of her mean-girl rivals went missing.Ms. Ritter, 35, who came of age in the small borough of Shickshinny, Pa., said her ambition was to bring to life a \u201ctwisted backwoods\u201d setting where \u201cthe party that you go to on Friday night is a bonfire,\u201d and \u201cthe district magistrate is putting people in juvie when he\u2019s out smoking weed with kids on the weekends.\u201dSome of the most evocative passages in \u201cBonfire\u201d are about Abby\u2019s awkward return to Barrens, a town she thought she outran. There, Ms. Ritter writes, beauty works \u201cby sidling up to you when you least expect it\u201d and an unappealing childhood home \u201cseems to rush toward me and not the other way around. Like it\u2019s eager to get me inside. Like it\u2019s been waiting.\u201dMs. Ritter did not have a high-school experience as brutal as Abby\u2019s but, she said, \u201cI understand the feelings of being the outcast and the loner.\u201dIn her early teens, she came to Shickshinny as an only child raised by a divorced mother, traits that she said made her a prominent target for whispers and rumors. \u201cAt that time, where I\u2019m from, nobody got divorced yet,\u201d she said, \u201cso everybody was like: \u2018Psst, psst, psst.\u2019\u201dBy the time she graduated high school, she was modeling extensively in New York, Tokyo and Milan, but craving work as an actor, producer and musician.Gren Wells, a screenwriter, director and friend of Ms. Ritter\u2019s, described her as \u201cpsychotically driven, in the best way.\u201d\u201cIn this industry, you have to be a self-starter and make your own career,\u201d Ms. Wells said. \u201cShe\u2019s not the type of actor who sits around and waits for a phone call. She will create her own product.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after the show came out,\u201d she said, \u201c that real women on the street would tell me how \u2018Jessica Jones\u2019 changed their lives \u2014 how it helped them deal with their own past sexual trauma.\u201dAfter several of those interactions, Ms. Ritter said, \u201cI started to think in different terms. It made me want to be even better.

{"Headline": "Justice Department Says Not So Fast to AT&T\u2019s Time Warner Bid", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt seemed like a match made in media heaven. AT&T is a telecommunications giant whose reach stretches to millions of people all over the country, and Time Warner, the owner of CNN, HBO and Warner Bros., has content galore. Together, the two companies would create a colossus straddling the worlds of internet access, news and entertainment.Until last week, AT&T\u2019s pending $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner seemed destined to close by the end of the year. On Wednesday, however, tensions between the Justice Department and executives at the two companies spilled out into the open.Now it seems possible that the Justice Department and AT&T will end up battling each other in court. The ongoing negotiations have also demonstrated how the Trump administration may regulate big-ticket mergers and acquisitions, representing the first major test for the government\u2019s antitrust strategy.A central component of the dispute, according to people from both companies and the Justice Department, is CNN \u2014 the network that Mr. Trump has frequently attacked as a purveyor of \u201cfake news.\u201dLate last week, AT&T called the Justice Department to request a meeting between top antitrust officials and AT&T\u2019s chief executive officer, Randall L. Stephenson. On Monday, at the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, Mr. Stephenson and AT&T\u2019s general counsel, David McAtee, met with Makan Delrahim, the new assistant attorney general for the department\u2019s antitrust division, and other Justice Department officials.In one account of the meeting, Justice Department officials called on AT&T to sell Turner Broadcasting \u2014 the group of cable channels under the Time Warner banner that includes CNN \u2014 as a potential requirement for gaining government approval, according to three people from the companies involved, who spoke on the condition that they not be named because of the delicacy of the negotiations.Or, the people said, AT&T could sell off DirecTV, the satellite television provider that it bought two years ago for nearly $49 billion. But AT&T and Time Warner executives say privately that such a concession is not realistic, given that DirecTV and its DirecTV Now streaming service would be crucial to a combined AT&T-Time Warner.A different account emerged later: It was Mr. Stephenson who had offered to sell off CNN as part of a strategy to win governmental approval, according to two Justice Department officials who declined to speak publicly about the meeting. The officials also insisted that selling the cable news channel would not be enough to address antitrust concerns.Mr. Stephenson responded with a public denial. \u201cUntil now, we\u2019ve never commented on our discussions with the D.O.J.,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \u201cBut given D.O.J.\u2019s statement this afternoon, it\u2019s important to set the record straight. Throughout this process, I have never offered to sell CNN and have no intention of doing so.\u201dThe Justice Department said it was committed to carrying out its duties in accordance with the laws and the facts. \u201cBeyond that, the department does not comment on any pending investigation,\u201d it said in a statement.AT&T and Time Warner are poised to fight to keep all their assets intact, believing that the government has no legal grounds for blocking the transaction, according to the company officials.At stake is a deal that, if completed, would join one of the nation\u2019s biggest wireless internet providers to HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. and DirecTV. Behind it is the desire to create a powerful provider and distributor of content, with AT&T able to both produce hits like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and distribute them to wireless service customers and DirecTV subscribers.The deal is designed to help AT&T counter slowing growth in its core wireless, internet and satellite businesses while fending off online video upstarts like Netflix and Hulu.Because the proposed deal involves two companies that do not compete directly with each other, executives at both AT&T and Time Warner believe there is little legal basis to block it.Mr. Trump, who has long accused CNN of being biased against him, has spoken against the proposed deal \u2014 most notably during a speech in the final month of the 2016 presidential campaign, in Gettysburg, Pa.After mentioning the \u201ccrooked\u201d media, he seemed to oppose AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner on populist grounds. \u201cAs an example of the power structure I\u2019m fighting,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cAT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration, because it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201dIn response to news articles speculating that the president had pressured the Justice Department concerning the proposed deal, White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said, \u201cThe President did not speak with the Attorney General about this matter, and no White House official was authorized to speak with the Department of Justice on this matter.\u201dMr. Delrahim, the assistant attorney general, also denied that Mr. Trump had been involved in the discussions.\u201cI have never been instructed by the White House on this or any other transaction under review by the antitrust division,\u201d he said.Critics of the merger have described it as a sign that there is too much consolidation in the media and telecommunications industries. Even lawmakers who have otherwise been critical of Mr. Trump have offered support for the Justice Department\u2019s continued review.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said on Twitter that the deal still needed a \u201cthorough\u201d and \u201cexacting\u201d review.The uncertainty has weighed on Time Warner\u2019s stock, as investors have worried that the deal may founder on antitrust grounds. Those fears began to crystallize on Wednesday, when AT&T\u2019s chief financial officer, John Stephens, said at an investor conference that the timing of the deal\u2019s closing was in doubt.\u201cWe are in active discussions with the D.O.J.,\u201d Mr. Stephens said. \u201cI cannot comment on those discussions. But with those discussions, I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain.\u201dTo win approval of the deal, AT&T early on hired lobbyists close to Vice President Mike Pence and others in the Trump administration. AT&T was among the top donors to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.Mr. Stephenson, the AT&T chief, has attended at least two meetings with Mr. Trump this year. Shortly after the first one, Mr. Trump lashed out at CNN on Twitter, saying that \u201ctheir credibility will soon be gone!\u201d After the second meeting, the president complimented Mr. Stephenson, saying he was doing \u201creally a top job.\u201dFighting the deal could prove challenging for regulators, antitrust experts said. The Justice Department would have to argue that AT&T would have an incentive to withhold Turner channels from rival broadband distributors like Verizon and Comcast. It could also try to demonstrate that AT&T would give channels like CNN or TNT preferential treatment over their competitors.A potential requirement to sell DirecTV is rooted in the idea that AT&T would otherwise have too much control over the distribution of content. The company could block competing networks like Starz or ESPN from running on DirecTV\u2019s satellite or streaming services, the argument goes.A counterargument to that line of thinking is the Obama administration\u2019s approval of Comcast\u2019s acquisition of NBC Universal in 2011. In that case, the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission attached several conditions to Comcast\u2019s business practices, including promises that Comcast would not withhold content from rival streaming services.Mr. Trump, however, was also critical of the Comcast-NBC deal in his Gettysburg speech last year.Brooks Barnes, Maggie Haberman, John Koblin and Charlie Savage contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The show, which will debut internationally on Dec. 1, centers on a small town plagued by strange goings-on at a nearby power facility.

But he said he has not, to the best of his recollection, had conversations with people inside the administration about the deal.To a question \u2014 posed by a CNN reporter in the crowd \u2014 about whether the pall over the deal can be attributed in part to a \u201cTrump factor,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said no.If completed, the acquisition of Time Warner \u2014 the owner of HBO, Warner Bros. and CNN \u2014 would transform AT&T into a colossus capable of both producing content and distributing it to millions of people via its wireless and satellite services.But on Wednesday, negotiations between the companies and the Justice Department appeared to be mired in politics.Accounts of AT&T\u2019s meeting with antitrust officials on Monday \u2014 which Mr. Stephenson said was \u201cvery productive\u201d \u2014 have differed.

{"Headline": "Why the AT&T-Time Warner Merger Makes Sense", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCombining AT&T, which distributes digital content over its wireless networks, with a news and entertainment provider like Time Warner is what economists and antitrust experts consider a classic vertical merger. Because the companies don\u2019t compete, their combining would not alter the competitive landscape in either the telecommunications or entertainment industries.For more than 40 years, through Republican and Democratic administrations, the courts have not blocked a vertical integration like this one.Typically more problematic for the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division are horizontal mergers, where two competitors in the same industry seek to combine. But this past summer the Trump administration waved through the horizontal merger of the giant retailer Amazon, already active in food sales, with a leading upscale grocer, Whole Foods. To now block a vertical integration of AT&T and Time Warner would indicate an inexcusably scattershot approach to antitrust decisions that would create enormous uncertainties for the broader business community and shake public confidence in the rule of law that underpins our democracy.Businesses seek to integrate vertically because such mergers tend to create efficiencies and synergies \u2014 benefiting both companies without posing major risks to their competitors or, more crucially, to consumers. With all the options available to consumers for receiving video programming these days \u2014 including cable, satellite, internet broadband and smartphones \u2014 the market is vibrantly, almost chaotically, competitive and innovative. When viewed in light of this creative turmoil, the AT&T-Time Warner transaction does not pose a competitive threat. If anything, it would create an attractive set of new options for the viewing public.To appreciate the dynamism of the video and television space, consider that Apple, a relatively new entrant, recently ordered two full seasons of Reese Witherspoon\u2019s latest television show without so much as seeing a pilot. It underscored the competitive new dynamics of the marketplace: Companies are throwing around cash like never before to attract viewers already happily distracted by an array of programming and viewing alternatives in this new golden age of television.Rather than Time Warner holding anything resembling a dominant position in the entertainment industry, it finds itself competing with emerging video powerhouses like Netflix and Amazon. And consumers are increasingly cutting the cable because they have numerous, often cheaper streaming options for getting content they want.How do we know? One need only look at perhaps the closest comparison to the AT&T-Time Warner merger \u2014 the marriage of the nation\u2019s largest cable and internet broadband provider, Comcast, to NBC Universal, which the Justice Department blessed in 2011. Despite the arguments of opponents at the time, there has been no negative impact to consumers or competitors. Quite the opposite \u2014 the competitive and creative forces that continue to change the industry have only accelerated since the Comcast-NBC merger.If the Justice Department cannot cite persuasive antitrust grounds for blocking the AT&T-Time Warner merger, the public will be left wondering whether political motives were involved or that the department\u2019s thinking was muddied by vague opposition to media consolidation. Neither of those reasons would likely stand up in federal court.By any objective analysis, the real power in the information industry these days is not in the wireless or entertainment industries. It is in companies like Google and Facebook, which possess the power to influence our national elections and redefine basic human interactions. In this brave new digital world, blocking the merger of AT&T and Time Warner would only undermine public confidence in the ability of antitrust enforcers to recognize reality.Instead, the Justice Department should approve the merger and get to work policing the real threats to competition and consumer welfare.Michael J. Santorelli is the director of the Advanced Communications Law and Policy Institute at New York Law School.Advertisement"}

This is what the sales factor apportionment system, already in use by most US states, does. Corporations earn income from sales. Therefore income should be allocated based upon the destination of those sales. MNC income should no longer be allocated based upon the location of a subsidiary that allegedly earned it. The location of sales is much more difficult to manipulate than the \u201corigin of income\u201d under the current system.\u201cThe US tax base for corporations would be calculated on the basis of a fraction of companies\u2019 worldwide income. This fraction would be the share of each company\u2019s worldwide sales that are destined for customers in the United States. The taxpayer, under SFA, is the whole unitary business, including all evasion-motivated subsidiaries over which the parent corporations exercise legal and economic control.\u201d\u201cIn effect, firms should be taxed on their access to a specific consumer market - from which they generate revenue - rather than on their cleverness at artificially allocating expenses and revenue in tax havens in which their subsidiaries \u2018incorporate.\u2019\u201d\u201cI think Aspen\u2019s work is needed more than ever.

The bank held as much as \u00a32.2 trillion in assets.Closing the Capital Resolution unit is an important moment, but the bank\u2019s turnaround is far from finished.R.B.S. has not reported an annual profit in nine years. It is not expected to report an annual profit until 2018 despite reporting a profit in the first half of this year.The bank passed a stress test by the Bank of England this year that measured the ability of lenders to weather another financial crisis, but remained among the weakest of the biggest British banks. (It was forced to bolster its capital last year after failing the regulatory test.)R.B.S. also remains 72 percent owned by the British government following a bailout during the financial crisis. The government said this month that it plans to resume sales of its holdings by 2019 and hopes to sell some \u00a315 billion of its stake by 2022.That process will be helped if R.B.S. can continue to improve its profitability and its capital position.
