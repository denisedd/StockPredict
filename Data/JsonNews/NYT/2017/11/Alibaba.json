McAtee II said in a statement:\u201cToday\u2019s DOJ lawsuit is a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrustprecedent. Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefitconsumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimatereason for our merger to be treated differently.\u201cFortunately, the Department of Justice doesn\u2019t havethe final say in this matter. Rather, it bears the burden of proving to the U.S. DistrictCourt that the transaction violates the law. We are confident that the Court will rejectthe Government\u2019s claims and permit this merger under longstanding legal precedent.\u201dAs the New York Times pointed out in August:\u201cThe Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, Chinese companies that dominate their home market, have rocketed this year to become global investor darlings...While American technology giants dominate people\u2019s online lives in Western countries, Tencent and Alibaba have soared by essentially carving up China, the world\u2019s single-largest internet market with more than 700 million online users.\u201d\u201cTheir rise is emblematic of a rebalancing of global technological influence. In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.\u201dThe world\u2019s largest banks have become better capitalized since financial crisis. They have raised more than $1.5 trillion in capital, according to the Financial Stability Board. That provides the banks with \u201cbuffers as much as 10x higher than a decade,\u201d writes S&P Global.But these financial instutions have also gotten much larger since the financial crisis.In the United States, for example, JPMorgan Chase has nearly doubled in size since the end of 2006. Bank of America has increased its asset by more than 50 percent, and Wells Fargo\u2019s assets are up more than 300 percent from their pre-crisis levels, according to S&P Global.Much of those increases are a result of deals struck during the heights of the crisis. JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual; Bank of America acquired CountryWide and Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo purchased Wachovia.Still the size of these banks is noteworthy. The \u2018too big to fail\u2019 distinction has drawn scrutiny from the Trump administration this year. A report from the Treasury Department last month \u201cdiscussed the need to eliminate regulation \u2018that fosters the creation or cements the market position of too-big-to-fail institutions\u2019 in order to prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts.\u201dA surprising percentage of respondents to DataTrek Research\u2019s bitcoin/cryptocurrency survey don\u2019t think so.\u2022 Just 39.4 percent of respondents said they believe bitcoin was in a bubble. \u201cWe were ready to see +70% responses indicating bitcoin\u2019s price is unsustainable. Less than 40% is, well, remarkable,\u201d writes DataTrek\u2019s co-founder Nicholas Colas.\u2022 Slightly more than 27 percent expect bitcoin to rise but at much slower pace. Just 16% think the value of bitcoin will double in the next six months.\u2022 \u201cA sizeable minority of respondents (39 \u2013 40 percent) see bitcoin as a potential analog to physical gold, both as a safe haven and a hedge against mistakes in central bank monetary policy,\u201d Mr. Colas writrs. Nearly 41 percent consider bitcoin a safe haven similar to gold, and 39 percent view bitcoin as a hedge against monetary policy.Would the Republican from Maine end up working to defeat the Senate\u2019s tax overhaul, as she did with attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act? Or would she simply lobby for changes to make it more acceptable?\u2022 \u201cIt is a simple but true concept, customers drive business growth, not tax rates, not mythical \u2018job creators.\u2019 Tax rates impact profitability, but are only very indirectly tied to hiring.\u201d\u2022 \u201cLabor markets determine salaries, not tax rates.\u201d\u2022 \u201cAs a C.E.O. and member of the board of directors at a public company, I can tell you that if we had an increase in profitability we would have been delighted but it would not lead in and of itself to more hiring or an increase in wages.\u201dThe euro has recovered from its initial decline after the news that Germans might have to go to the polls. But that hasn\u2019t eased the anxiousness of some market commentators.\u201cAngela Merkel\u2019s position seems to be significantly weakened. This could leave Europe\u2019s largest economy politically paralyzed for the time being, reducing the chances for any breakthrough in the E.U. reform agenda or the Brexit negotiations.\u201d\u201cEven if there are re-elections, that is very unlikely to be populist. That\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be a limited down reaction.\u201dAfter the financial crisis, the federal government was expected to aggressively pursue criminal cases against top financiers. Prosecutions were rare, except with obscure, or relatively junior, industry players against whom it was easy to build cases, because prosecutors were under pressure to move quickly and win cases.Philip Baker became one of those targets.He was not a big fish. But the desire to resolve the case swiftly led a powerful United States attorney to insert a transfer-to-Canada clause into an otherwise airtight plea agreement.In 2011, the government allowed Comcast to absorb NBCUniversal in another \u201charmless\u201d vertical merger (a deal that I opposed). Afterwards, Comcast was caught discriminating against rival cable channels and slowing down rival online video services. All the while, America tumbled down global broadband rankings.

{"Headline": "Statement From DST Global", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCertain contextual information is highly relevant to the Times\u2019 readers\u2019 understanding of Mr. Milner\u2019s work and, in particular, DST Global\u2019s investments in Facebook and Twitter.To begin with, there is nothing unusual about an international investment firm \u2014 DST Global is headquartered in Hong Kong \u2014 accepting investments from international investors, including sovereigns. Also, it is worth remembering that Russia-U.S. relations were much better in 2009 and 2011 when these investments were made following Secretary of State Clinton pressing the \u201cReset Button\u201d in Moscow in 2009.DST Global\u2019s investments in Facebook and Twitter were just two of the more than 30 internet companies around the world that DST Global\u2019s funds have invested in \u2014 including Airbnb, Spotify, JD.com, Zalando and Alibaba. Since 2009, DST Global has invested $7 billion in the consumer internet sector, with a majority being invested in non-U.S. companies \u2014 and with less than 5% coming from VTB Bank. VTB Bank was the only Russian government institution that invested in any DST Global funds.In addition, all investors in DST Global \u2014 including Mr. Usmanov, VTB Bank, and a number of sovereign wealth funds from all over the world \u2014 are passive investors. That means they are simply committing funds to be invested by DST Global in companies of DST Global\u2019s choosing, and they have no influence over what companies DST Global chooses to invest in or any other decision-making.DST Global, for its part, was also a passive investor in Facebook and Twitter, meaning that it did not seek any board seats or have any influence on these companies\u2019 operations and management. Moreover, there were dozens of DST Global investors making up the funds that invested in Facebook and Twitter \u2014 Mr. Usmanov was just one of 50 passive investors in DST Global\u2019s fund that invested in Facebook, and VTB Bank was one of 40 passive investors in the DST Global fund that invested in Twitter.Finally, DST Global divested its position in Facebook in 2013 and in Twitter in 2014, shortly after each of those companies\u2019 initial public offerings and well before the 2016 U.S. elections.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Trump Helped Liberate U.C.L.A. \u2018Knuckleheads\u2019 From China", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey learned that three American college basketball players \u2014 representing a storied sports program visiting China for an early-season game sponsored by one of China\u2019s largest companies \u2014 had been arrested on Nov. 8, accused of stealing designer sunglasses at a high-end shopping mall.The alleged offense was hardly life or death. But what had begun as a simple accusation of celebrity shoplifting threatened to escalate into a full-blown international incident just as Mr. Trump arrived in China on a 12-day mission through Asia, his first foreign trip to the region.\u201cThese are law and order guys; they have pretty swift justice,\u201d John Kelly, the president\u2019s chief of staff, said of the Chinese authorities in a telephone interview later. \u201cAn awful lot of American kids don\u2019t realize that the kinds of things that in United States society we tolerate with a slap on the wrist, a lot of countries they take very seriously.\u201dIn addition to Mr. Trump, the weeklong diplomatic drama involved the players themselves, who remained detained at their hotel in the provincial city of Hangzhou for most of the week; U.C.L.A., an elite American university with an international reputation; and the Chinese retail giant Alibaba, which sponsored the team\u2019s visit.In other cases, detained Americans have become geopolitical pawns, often trapped in a kind of legal limbo for months or years.And in a few instances, the outcome has been horrific, as in the case of Otto Warmbier, an American student in North Korea who was tortured and later died after being detained on charges that he tried to steal a poster from his hotel.But just as concern deepened about the fate of the three young athletes in China, their detention abruptly ended, aided, it seems, by Mr. Trump\u2019s direct intervention with the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. On Tuesday, the three players, including the star freshman LiAngelo Ball, the brother of the N.B.A. rookie Lonzo Ball, were allowed to leave their hotel and board a flight back to California.\u201cThe three U.C.L.A. men\u2019s basketball student-athletes involved in the incident with authorities in Hangzhou, China, are on a flight back home to Los Angeles,\u201d the Pacific-12, the athletics conference to which the university belongs, said in a statement, adding that \u201cthe matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of the Chinese authorities.\u201d\u201cWe want to thank the president, the White House and the U.S. State Department for their efforts towards resolution,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Kelly, who arrived back in the United States with Mr. Trump Tuesday night aboard Air Force One, provided details about the president\u2019s diplomatic outreach on behalf of the U.C.L.A. players.\u201cOur president said to Xi, \u2018Do you know anything about these knuckleheads that got caught allegedly stealing?\u2019\u201d Mr. Kelly said. Unaware of the episode, the Chinese president dispatched an aide to get more information. \u201cThe president was saying, \u2018It\u2019s not too serious. We\u2019d love to see this taken care of in an expeditious way,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kelly added.The three players had been accused of shoplifting from a Louis Vuitton store next to their hotel in Hangzhou, in eastern China, where they were preparing to play in a tournament. (Playing without the three freshmen, U.C.L.A. defeated Georgia Tech, 63-60, in Shanghai on Friday.)Mr. Kelly said Mr. Trump\u2019s intervention, as well as diplomatic efforts by State Department diplomats, led to the reduction of the charges to the equivalent of misdemeanors as well as the release of the three players to their hotel, where they were placed under temporary house arrest. It was there that Mr. Kelly talked to Chris Carlson, an associate athletic director at U.C.L.A., and to the players on the phone the next day.\u201cTo say the least, they were very apologetic,\u201d said Mr. Kelly, who pointedly did not ask the student-athletes whether they had, in fact, attempted to steal the merchandise they were accused of taking. \u201cThey were just profuse in their apologies for embarrassing the country and embarrassing the team.\u201dMr. Kelly told the players that Mr. Trump had intervened on their behalf and that he was \u201cvery optimistic that this would be taken care of in short order.\u201dIn China, where the justice system has a very high conviction rate, theft can bring punishment ranging from a few days to years in prison. Mr. Kelly said that had the players been charged with the equivalent of felonies \u2014 because of the high cost of the merchandise \u2014 they could have received prison sentences of five to 10 years.\u201cI bet they learned a lesson in their lives,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump was uncharacteristically quiet about the players and their situation until his overseas trip was winding down. He did not tweet about the case as the players sat trapped in their rooms. American officials did not put out any statements about the situation.But once he was headed home, Mr. Trump provided the first indications that the actions of the three young men had prompted a conversation at the highest of levels.\u201cI will tell you, when I heard about it two days ago, I had a great conversation with President Xi,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters during a brief conversation Tuesday before the students were formally allowed to leave their hotel. \u201cHe was terrific, and they\u2019re working on it right now. And hopefully everything is going to work out.\u201dMr. Trump called the alleged actions of the basketball players \u201cunfortunate,\u201d and grimly noted the toughness of the Chinese judicial system. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re talking about very long prison sentences,\u201d the president told reporters. \u201cThey do not play games.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been terrific,\u201d the president said. \u201cPresident Xi has been terrific on that subject.\u201dThe warm presidential relationship appeared to pay off with the release of Ball, a freshman guard; and Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, both freshman forwards. Mr. Trump emphasized that it was a \u201cvery, very rough situation, with what happened to them.\u201dThe arrests of the three young men could have derailed efforts to bridge the cultural divide. Hours before their release, Mr. Trump told reporters that the incident \u201cwas not something that should have happened.\u201dBut even then the president seemed to know something positive might be in the works. Asked if he expected to see the basketball players coming home soon, he answered: \u201cI hope so. I hope so.\u201dJust hours later, they were on a plane, too.Mark Landler reported from Manila, and Michael D. Shear from Washington. Victor Mather contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India\u2019s Top Payments App Adds Chatting, Challenging WhatsApp", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 India\u2019s smartphone users love Paytm for sending money and WhatsApp for sending messages. Now each company is getting into the other\u2019s business.Paytm unveiled an updated version of its service on Friday that integrates chat features, including photo and video sharing, into its market-leading digital wallet.The move is a pre-emptive strike against WhatsApp, the global messaging app used by about two-thirds of India\u2019s 300 million smartphone users. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, has been developing a person-to-person payment service for India that it plans to introduce in the next few months.Deepak Abbot, Paytm\u2019s senior vice president of product, said his company had decided to add the communications feature, called Inbox, because its executives saw millions of people using its service to send money to other individuals without any way of discussing those payments inside the app.\u201cIf I sent money to you, I\u2019d wonder, \u2018Hey, have you received the money?\u2019\u201d Mr. Abbot said in an interview. \u201cEither I\u2019d call you, or find another messaging app.\u201d From that simple problem, a full-fledged chat service was born.With nearly $2 billion in financing from Alibaba, China\u2019s leading e-commerce company, and SoftBank, the Japanese investment giant, Paytm jumped in. It marketed itself to small merchants and consumers as an easy way to make all sorts of payments with a few taps on a smartphone. The company now offers a wide range of products, from gold by the gram to airline and movie tickets, and it said 100 million Indians visited its service at least once a month.WhatsApp, which claims more than 200 million monthly active users in India and 1.3 billion worldwide, has eyed business services and person-to-person payments as a potential way to generate revenue from what has been a free service. Facebook paid $22 billion in cash and stock for WhatsApp in 2014.The messaging service has already begun experimenting with verified business accounts in India, which companies use to communicate with customers. The payments feature will let Indian users send immediate payments to one another via a chat message.Neeraj Arora, head of business at WhatsApp, said in an October interview that his team was studying opportunities created by India\u2019s demonetization and the government\u2019s broader campaign to push more business and services online.\u201cThey are trying to digitize every part of society,\u201d said Mr. Arora, who also sits on the board of Paytm. \u201cWe play right in the middle of it. It\u2019s natural for us to think about improving the experience.\u201dWhatsApp\u2019s overall popularity could give its new payments service a leg up, but Mr. Abbot said it would also raise awareness for all digital payment services, including Paytm.WhatsApp, like another new service from Google, Tez, will probably be limited to transferring funds from one person\u2019s bank account to another\u2019s because of complex Indian banking regulations. Paytm has cast itself as a broader financial player, handling payments made by credit and debit cards, the government\u2019s electronic transfer system, and digital wallets.A Paytm banking affiliate is exploring how to offer loans too small to interest a normal bank, with creditworthiness assessed by examining a borrower\u2019s transactions on the service. And a Paytm digital mall is selling physical products.Messaging is just Paytm\u2019s latest brand extension. Mr. Abbot said other plans for the chat service included a personalized news feed of special offers based on each user\u2019s history in the app.\u201cEventually it might become the main screen for Paytm,\u201d he said. \u201cPaytm is at heart a payments company.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Friday night, Alibaba hosted a lavish gala in Shanghai, directed by one of the producers behind the 2016 Academy Awards. Celebrities such as Nicole Kidman, Pharrell Williams and Maria Sharapova helped count down the moments before the 60,000 participating global brands released their Singles Day deals to shoppers.One offer, from the Chongqing-based online alcohol brand Jiang Xiao Bai, allowed 33 fast-moving customers to make a single payment of 11,111 yuan, or $1,673, for a lifetime supply of a grain liquor known as baijiu.Singles Day, which is largely powered through Alibaba\u2019s Tmall marketplace, was a test of the company\u2019s logistics network.

{"Headline": "Targeting China\u2019s Purchases, Congress Proposes Tougher Reviews of Foreign Investments", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 China has been a tricky economic partner for the United States, offering both lucrative opportunities for collaboration and a minefield of security risks.The dual approach highlights the challenge facing the Trump administration as it tries to articulate a clear strategy for dealing with China. Mr. Trump campaigned on a get-tough approach to China \u2014 a view that is shared by many Republican and Democratic lawmakers who see the country as a growing threat \u2014 but he must now balance that position with preserving the business ties that much of the United States economy depends on.On Wednesday, Senator John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, introduced legislation that could add thousands of companies with foreign ties to the list of those reviewed each year by Cfius and provide more funding to deal with that increase. A similar House bill was also introduced on Wednesday by Representative Robert Pittenger, a Republican from North Carolina.Chinese investment in the United States and elsewhere has surged in recent years as the Chinese government encouraged companies to acquire technology and know-how abroad, and as Chinese companies and wealthy individuals sought safer refuges for their money.In the United States, Chinese investment tripled from the previous year to reach $46 billion in 2016, according to the Rhodium Group, a research firm. This year, tighter Chinese controls on outbound capital appear to have cut that figure sharply.\u201cThey are looking at a lot more deals than they have traditionally, and a lot more politically sensitive deals,\u201d said Thad McBride, the chairman of the international trade group at the law firm Bass, Berry and Sims.That would only increase under the legislation introduced on Wednesday, which would expand reviews from focusing strictly on mergers and acquisitions to include joint ventures. Lawmakers said some Chinese companies had been bypassing the Cfius review by forming joint ventures with American companies or licensing their technology. The legislation would seek to close that loophole by requiring an automatic review of joint ventures that exceeded a certain threshold of foreign ownership and expand scrutiny of certain emerging technologies that could give countries like China an edge over the United States.\u201cThis bill takes a measured approach by providing long overdue reforms to better protect our country, while also working to ensure that beneficial foreign investment is not chilled,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said.China has already objected to reviews of its acquisitions, describing them as protectionism in disguise. Chinese companies have tried to highlight how their investments create jobs and support economic growth in the United States, and thus dovetail with the president\u2019s goals \u2014 including the administration\u2019s primary rationale for tax reform.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the chairman of the multiagency Cfius panel, said last month that the Trump administration was \u201cworking very proactively with the House and the Senate on areas where we think there could be legislative improvements.\u201d\u201cI would expect there will be a lot of bipartisan support for that,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin added.He said there was a clear need for reform that would prevent companies from doing \u201cthings indirectly that they\u2019re not allowed to do directly.\u201dIn the United States, companies are freely allowed to sell their assets to the highest bidder, unless the acquisition could pose a security threat. But some proposals to reform the Cfius process have called for expanding that criterion as well.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, proposed a plan in August that would have created an additional review mechanism to consider whether investments, mergers and acquisitions were economically harmful to the United States, either by costing jobs or the loss of technology to competitors.Lawyers and investment bankers say that the shadow of Cfius is looming larger than ever over corporate transactions. In Singapore, for example, officials with the government\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Temasek, say they perceive Cfius as increasingly looking at deals through the lens of what their long-term effect could be on the American economy and companies, rather than through a strictly national security prism.But the review process is especially daunting for Chinese companies. Ya-Qin Zhang, the president of Baidu, the giant Chinese internet company, said at a Silicon Valley deal-making conference in October that his company was looking to do more deals in the United States but \u201chas to be careful\u201d because of Cfius and the political climate.\u201cThe scrutiny that Cfius and Congress is now having on Chinese deals\u201d is probably at its highest level ever, Jerry Yang, the Yahoo co-founder, said at the Silicon Valley conference in October.Mr. Yang described the process of government authorities in the United States and China reviewing deals as \u201cthe invisible hand of the government \u2014 or maybe it isn\u2019t so invisible,\u201d he said.David Enrich and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade Policy Is Lifting Exports. Of Canadian Lobster.", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCENTREVILLE, Nova Scotia \u2014 This lobster factory on a windswept bay in eastern Canada is so remote that its workers have to drive for miles just to get cellphone service. But Gidney Fisheries is truly global, with its lobsters landing on plates in Paris and Shanghai through trade agreements hammered out in far-off capitals.Of late, these trade pacts have been shifting in the factory\u2019s favor, giving it an advantage over its American competitors.A new trade agreement between Canada and the European Union has slashed tariffs on imports of Canadian lobsters. That means more 747s filled with Christmas-red crustaceans will depart from Nova Scotia for European markets this winter \u2014 and more revenue will flow to Gidney Fisheries. The factory, which in the 1800s sent its lobsters to Boston by steamship, is flush with potential as it gains access to new markets and plans to increase its work force by roughly 50 percent, adding dozens of positions to its current payroll of around 85 workers.\u201cFor us, free trade is a good thing,\u201d said Robert MacDonald, the president of Gidney Fisheries, which processes 10,000 to 15,000 lobsters a day.The Trump administration has adopted a skeptical view of trade deals, promising to scrap or renegotiate global agreements that it believes put American companies and workers at a disadvantage. Among them is the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the United States is trying to renegotiate. It will join its partners in the agreement, Canada and Mexico, for a fifth round of talks in Mexico City that officially begin on Friday.Some trade experts, though, say America\u2019s get-tough approach is dissuading foreign partners from jumping into talks. Other countries, like Canada, are forging ahead with their own trade deals as they balk at the tough terms the United States is demanding in its trade negotiations. Over the weekend, a group of 11 countries including Canada announced that they were committed to moving ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sweeping multinational trade deal negotiated by the Obama administration.As these deals progress, American companies, particularly exporters, are finding themselves on the losing end of global trade as their competitors abroad gain easier access to foreign markets.\u201cWe live in such a low-margin world, where industry after industry is engaged in fierce global competition,\u201d said John G. Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThere is a sense in which the United States is standing still, while countries around us are moving forward.\u201dIt\u2019s a historic shift for the United States, which has long led the charge for free trade and open markets. The United States has traditionally been the global leader in forging trade pacts, including during the Obama administration, which negotiated an earlier version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and began talks with Europe on an agreement known as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.Skeptics in the current administration criticize these pacts as a global race to the bottom that has cost American jobs and depressed wages. President Trump condemned the Trans-Pacific Partnership as one of the worst deals ever negotiated and officially withdrew the United States from the pact on his fourth day in office. Talks with Europe over the trans-Atlantic trade pact have stalled.When Americans think about lobster, Maine often comes to mind. But Nova Scotia has emerged as a fierce competitor in exporting lobsters, particularly to Europe. Last year, American lobstermen sold only slightly more to Europe than their Canadian counterparts.That balance could soon shift given the Canadian-European trade pact, which eliminated an 8 percent European tariff on live lobster when it went into effect in September. Tariffs on frozen and processed Canadian lobster will be phased out in the next three to five years as part of the agreement.The elimination of European tariffs is \u201cthe single most challenging issue\u201d for the American lobster industry, said Annie Tselikis, the executive director of the Maine Lobster Dealers\u2019 Association, which represents companies that buy lobster from Maine fishermen. \u201cThis trade agreement does give Canada a huge leg up in the European marketplace,\u201d she said.Ms. Tselikis said the pact was encouraging American companies to invest in new facilities in Canada to qualify for the lower European tariff.\u201cIf the argument is you\u2019re not going to develop this trade policy because you\u2019re worried about outsourcing jobs \u2014 well, here we are, potentially outsourcing jobs due to an absence of trade policy,\u201d she said.Gidney Fisheries, which exports live and frozen lobster, is poised to take advantage of the changing terms of trade. Last year, in anticipation of increased demand, the factory invested in state-of-the-art technology to set itself apart.The company imported a German machine, sometimes used to make cold-pressed juice, that creates pressure of up to 87,000 pounds per square inch. The machine compresses the lobster in its shell, breaking the connective tissue, killing the lobster in seconds and allowing the meat to be extracted entirely raw \u2014 a selling point for chefs and consumers, as the process is considered relatively humane.On the factory floor in September, a worker in a gray smock covered by a shiny rubber apron loaded lobsters into a plastic tube to feed into the machine. A dozen workers smashed claws, used tiny air hoses to remove entrails and sorted peachy-pink lobster meat into various packages to be flash frozen.\u201cA decade or two ago, there would be very few players who would have been shipping internationally,\u201d Mr. MacDonald said. \u201cWe now ship live lobsters all over the world.\u201dOnce mostly confined to the plates of the rich, lobster has gone mass market. A glut in the global catch roughly five years ago \u2014 the product of overfishing cod, a natural lobster predator \u2014 caused the price to plummet. Lobster rolls and lobster mac and cheese suddenly appeared on menus of fast food chains like Pret a Manger, Au Bon Pain, Quiznos and even McDonald\u2019s locations in New England.Better packaging and faster freight services allowed American and Canadian exporters to expand into Europe and Asia. Exporters found a promising new market in China, where newly affluent diners were eagerly adopting Western luxury products like wine, caviar and lobster as a marker of taste and distinction.Gidney Fisheries sought to tap into that market, with the help of Duan Zeng, Mr. MacDonald\u2019s colleague. Ms. Zeng, who has a master\u2019s degree in fish biology, does much of her work on WeChat, a Chinese mobile app, where she sells its wares. Last December, the company teamed up with Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, to sell premium lobsters online.Gidney Fisheries\u2019 largest market by far is still the United States, where the company supplies restaurants and hotel chains with Nova Scotia lobsters. But given the changing dynamics of trade pacts, Europe could soon be its fastest-growing market, much to the chagrin of American lobstermen, who were hopeful the United States would sign its own agreement with the European Union.The Trump administration has not said whether it will continue trade talks with Europe. But other trade pacts under discussion, including Nafta, have shown little progress. In mid-October, Jyrki Katainen, a high-ranking European Union official, said Europe was \u201cnegotiating with all Nafta countries, and with all TPP countries, except one\u201d \u2014 a not-so-veiled reference to America.John Weekes, Canada\u2019s Nafta negotiator in the 1990s, said he initially believed Canadian companies might have just a narrow window of advantage over their American competitors. Now, that window looks quite a bit larger.\u201cIt does open up a number of opportunities for Canadians that clearly aren\u2019t going to be available to Americans in the foreseeable future,\u201d Mr. Weekes said.Advertisement"}

Fanatics quickly posted a rendering of his No. 78 jersey on its website and on the N.F.L.\u2019s online shop, which it also operates.Sales skyrocketed. Manufacturing facilities in Kentucky and Florida went to work pressing Mr. Villanueva\u2019s name and number onto thousands of blank Pittsburgh jerseys for next-day shipping. Overnight, a player who had never caught a pass or scored a touchdown had the N.F.L.\u2019s best-selling jersey.\u201cThat moment happened, people wanted to immediately buy that jersey,\u201d Michael Rubin, the company\u2019s chairman and principal owner said. \u201cA week later, that moment is mostly over.\u201dThese micro-moments, as Mr. Rubin calls them, happen all the time in sports: A player reaches a milestone, has a breakout performance or is traded to a new team. Apparel companies have traditionally been poorly positioned to meet the accompanying fan demand as it surges. Fanatics is changing that and, in the process, carving out a lucrative niche in a fiercely competitive online-retail industry largely dominated by Amazon.Fanatics has licensing rights with the North America\u2019s four major sports leagues, more than 500 colleges, Nascar, Major League Soccer and the Professional Golf Association. The company is similar to fast-fashion retailers like H&M, Uniqlo and Zara, integrating design and manufacturing with distribution to fulfill orders within hours. After the Chicago Cubs won the World Series last year, Fanatics used Uber to deliver championship gear to some fans within minutes.As a result, Fanatics has more than doubled its revenue in just a few years. It expects to take in $2 billion in 2017, and to ship more than 10 million items from Nov. 27, Cyber Monday, to Christmas, at a rate of 40,000 packages an hour, its busiest holiday retail season to date.The strategy has attracted a $1 billion investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. The Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has also taken a stake.\u201cIf you\u2019re selling the same merchandise that\u2019s commonly available, and you\u2019ve got no point of differentiation, you\u2019re dead,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of when you die.\u201dMr. Rubin said that his company\u2019s licensing deals, which run from 13 to 17 years long with each of the four major professional sports leagues, are exclusive enough that \u201csomebody can\u2019t be a significant player without the rights that we possess.\u201dAmazon sells and ships team-branded products from some licensed vendors and through its third-party marketplace. For now at least, Mr. Rubin sounds like he does not see that as much of a threat.\u201cAmazon is an incredible company,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have 5,000 full-time employees that go to bed and wake up thinking about the licensed sports business.\u201dMr. Rubin, 45, got into the industry as a 12-year-old selling ski equipment out of his parents\u2019 basement in nearby Lafayette Hill.He attended Villanova University for one semester before dropping out to start a business that handled online sales and fulfillment for big-box retailers just as the e-commerce wave was beginning. He sold the company, G.S.I. Commerce, to eBay for $2.4 billion in 2011, not long after he became a part-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers. (He also owns a stake in the New Jersey Devils.)Among G.S.I.\u2019s properties was Fanatics, which had started in 1995 as a single brick-and-mortar store in a mall in Jacksonville, Fla. Mr. Rubin liked the business so much that he bought it and two other consumer-oriented properties back from eBay, combining them into a company called Kynetic.\u201cWe sold the company on a Friday and we were at work again on Monday morning,\u201d Saj Cherian, Mr. Rubin\u2019s chief of staff, said during an interview at the company\u2019s offices in this Philadelphia suburb on a recent afternoon.\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Rubin interjected, \u201cI was at work Saturday morning.\u201dThe industry that fuels Mr. Rubin\u2019s enthusiasm is substantial. According to the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers Association, global retail sales of licensed sports merchandise reached $25 billion in 2016. The largest portion of that, 28.1 percent, was apparel.But after a jersey and T-shirt craze in the 1990s, demand flattened. Leagues parceled out their most precious licenses to brands like Nike and Adidas, which mostly seemed concerned with using on-field uniforms as marketing tools, rather than with producing gear for fans.At that point, Mr. Rubin said, the licensed sports merchandise market was \u201ca very sleepy business\u201d without a robust online presence. The leagues were doing more to reach fans directly in areas like ticketing and social media, he said, but lagging when it came to selling goods.Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, agreed.\u201cThe industry needed to be disrupted,\u201d Mr. Kraft said. Referring to Mr. Rubin, he said: \u201cHe\u2019s brought tech, innovation and a vertical on-demand model that\u2019s brought agility to an industry that hadn\u2019t changed much in decades.\u201dAmong the micro-moments that highlighted the new need for speed was Jeremy Lin\u2019s emergence as a sudden star for the New York Knicks in 2012 amid the so-called Linsanity phenomenon.\u201cWhen Linsanity happened, within 12 hours to 24 hours, there were no jerseys to get,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cSo you had this huge demand, and there\u2019s no jerseys available. Then you order them like crazy, and by the time they get in, the moment\u2019s over.\u201dSal LaRocca, the N.B.A.\u2019s president of global partnerships, said the episode \u201cwas a large catalyst in moving to where we ultimately moved to with Fanatics.\u201d The N.B.A. entered an initial partnership with the company in 2015 to run the N.B.A. store; Fanatics acquired the rights to sell replica jerseys beginning this season.In 2013, Mr. Rubin moved most of Fanatics\u2019 executive team to Silicon Valley from Florida and started a team dedicated to mobile platforms. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get the type of talent we needed in the speed we needed in Jacksonville,\u201d he said.This year, the company will spend $120 million to improve the customer experience, its data acquisition efforts, its communications with manufacturers and the Fanatics app.The investment is critical, Mr. Rubin said, given that 90 percent of the company\u2019s business is online, and more than 50 percent comes through mobile devices. Fanatics declined to disclose sales figures, but said that about a quarter of its sales have traditionally come in December. This year, it expects 70 million unique visitors to its websites, including more than 300 online team stores, for the month.Major League Baseball said sales of Fanatics products on MLBShop.com were up 67 percent this year, thanks in part to the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on hot-market items.\u201cIt\u2019s an untapped market that we\u2019ve all been missing,\u201d said Noah Garden, M.L.B.\u2019s executive vice president of business.Fanatics\u2019 only ties to brick-and-mortar retailing are the roughly 30 team or league outlets operates in arenas and stadiums. Mr. Rubin envisions the arena stores complementing the online operation, with fans at games using their phones to order goods, and then having the items delivered directly to their seats.Sports is particularly well suited to online retail, with many fans living far from their favorite teams\u2019 hometowns. But Fanatics\u2019 success depends in part on its deals with the leagues, which could create competition by entering agreements with rivals.\u201cWhile I have a lot of admiration for what Fanatics has done, what they\u2019re doing is replicable,\u201d said Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at the market research firm NPD Group.The company is not waiting for that to happen. Doug Mack, the Fanatics\u2019 chief executive, said it wanted to expand globally, and had already acquired rights to sell merchandise from nearly a dozen English Premier League teams, including Manchester United and Everton.Mr. Rubin said he thought Fanatics could be a $10 billion company in 10 years, with half of its business coming from beyond North America.At that size, it would surpass Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and Under Armour, even if sports fans might not realize who was responsible for that must-have Tom Brady jersey.\u201cThey probably don\u2019t know it now,\u201d Mr. Kraft, the Patriots owner, said. \u201cBut they will.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified one of the English Premier League teams that has a licensing deal with Fanatics, the sports merchandise company. It is Everton, not Chelsea.An earlier version of this article misidentified the operator of the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 website. It is the team itself, not the sports apparel maker Fanatics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Feminist Collective, Not Just a Store in NoLIta", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis was not a typical store party.Twenty-something shoppers in beanie caps sat cross-legged on a bubble-gum-pink floor, filling out postcards on behalf of reproductive rights. Others browsed tote bags that read, \u201cThe Future is Female,\u201d and sniffed car air fresheners labeled \u201cNasty Woman.\u201dRather than merchandise its own goods, Bulletin Broads functions more like a mini-flea market, renting its shelf space to emerging brands seeking a brick-and-mortar presence. And it does so with a political bent.\u201cWe think of Broads as both a store and feminist brand collective,\u201d said Ali Kriegsman, 26, one of its founders. \u201cIt\u2019s where like-minded women can meet and create a small hub of resistance.\u201dThe NoLIta store, as well as its predecessor in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, is stocked exclusively with feminist-minded merchandise created by small brands run by women. Ten percent of all proceeds go to Planned Parenthood of New York City. The stores have raised more than $43,000.But Bulletin Broads did not start out as a store. Its first iteration was a \u201cshop-able\u201d magazine that featured designer profiles alongside merchandise. \u201cWe wanted to take what was happening at the Brooklyn Flea with all these cool, underground brands, pluck the best ones and give them a digital home,\u201d Ms. Kriegsman said.The result was a highly curated version of Etsy. Indeed, Ms. Kriegsman and her business partner Alana Branston would comb Etsy and Instagram to pick their vendors.They sent out their first newsletter (or bulletin) in 2015. It featured an architectural rocking chair, a cheeky ashtray and locally made soaps.Sales had stalled. \u201cWe interviewed all the brands and figured out they didn\u2019t really want another online sales channel,\u201d Ms. Kriegsman said. \u201cThey wanted a physical presence.\u201dSo Bulletin began hosting a weekend flea market, renting an 18,000-square-foot parking lot in Williamsburg and offering stalls for a fee. The women began to bring in a healthy income but realized the weekly schlep wasn\u2019t sustainable. \u201cEvery weekend we would wake up at 7 a.m. to set up,\u201d Ms. Branston, 30, said. Last year, they set up a 450-square-foot shop at 145 Wythe Avenue in Brooklyn.Borrowing a page from the sharing economy, they rented out shelf space to emerging brands that can\u2019t afford their own stores. Brands are either invited to sell in their stores or can apply online. Brands get 70 percent of sales, Bulletin keeps 20, and 10 goes to charity.\u201cWe help digital brands sell in physical stores,\u201d as the website puts it.The formula seems to be working. A third store, Bulletin Mini Mall, devoted to 1990s nostalgia, recently opened at 927 Broadway in the Flatiron district.\u201cSustainable activism is key to Broads,\u201d Ms. Kriegsman said. \u201cWe all have jobs, emails to answer. We want to make it easy for women to support women in a way that doesn\u2019t disrupt their daily lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Revealing Spin on the \u2018Sharing Economy\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyFor decades after its Communist revolution in 1949, China was known as \u201cthe kingdom of bicycles.\u201d The one-speed Flying Pigeons that swarmed the streets were not simply a cheap mode of transportation. They were symbols of a shared aspiration. Along with a radio, a watch and a sewing machine, a bicycle was one of four possessions \u2014 known as sanzhuan yixiang, or \u201cthree rounds and sound\u201d \u2014 that urban Chinese families felt they needed to be part of the modern world. By the time I joined the masses in 2001, cycling across Beijing for daily Mandarin classes, cars had begun to displace bicycles. Pedaling alongside my fellow commuters \u2014 students, workers, pensioners \u2014 I felt part of a communal experience that might soon be gone forever.I was wrong, of course. China\u2019s cities are suddenly teeming with bicycles, and the humble one-speed, that remnant of China\u2019s collective memory, again serves as more than just a means of conveyance. It is now a digital device too, helping shape one of China\u2019s most dynamic growth engines \u2014 the so-called sharing economy. Three years ago, bike-sharing didn\u2019t exist in China. Today more than 40 companies offer the service. And the top two alone, Mobike and Ofo, handle more than 50 million rides every day, solving the \u201clast mile\u201d problem of getting people from public transportation to their homes.China\u2019s bike-sharing explosion is driven by digital innovations that make renting \u201cdockless\u201d bikes easy, cheap and completely cool. All it takes is a smartphone: to find the nearest bike via GPS, to scan its QR code and open its smartlocks and to pay a minuscule fee (usually 15 cents or less per ride) through a mobile-payment app. At the end, the bikes can be left almost anywhere. (In the United States, bicycles often need to be picked up and returned to a fixed dock, as with New York\u2019s Citi Bike.) For a generation of consumers conditioned to adapt to new things, the draw is no longer the pride of ownership but has become convenience and cachet. For the companies and, more pointedly, the Chinese government, the potential windfall comes not so much from profits, which remain elusive, but from the consumer data produced by every transaction.The state-run press agency, Xinhua, has trumpeted bike-sharing as one of China\u2019s \u201cfour great new inventions.\u201d (The other three are mobile payments, e-commerce and high-speed rail.) It may sound absurd to compare a dockless bike to the world-changing inventions of China\u2019s past: paper, gunpowder, the compass and movable type. But the boast conveys the importance that Beijing assigns the \u201csharing economy\u201d in helping China make the leap from a manufacturing-based to a service-oriented economy. Last year, according to government figures, China\u2019s sharing economy accounted for more than $500 billion in transactions involving roughly 600 million people. (An estimated 55 million Americans will use a sharing service this year, according to a CBS report.) And with Beijing planning on an annual 40 percent growth rate, officials are commanding this new economic engine to account for 10 percent of the national gross domestic product by 2020 and 20 percent by 2025.In this frenzy, investors have thrown millions of dollars at almost any venture with a \u201csharing\u201d label, from basketballs and refrigerators to luxury handbags and phone chargers. Not all the ideas fare well. The Shared Girlfriend sex-doll service, for example, was shut down in September in response to a public outcry. The police also forced a Beijing company to stop renting out \u201cnapping capsules,\u201d condemning them as fire hazards. Other ideas, on closer inspection, hardly look innovative. The \u201cshared bookstore\u201d is really just a lending library. And the \u201cshared washing-machine service\u201d \u2014 isn\u2019t that a laundromat?China\u2019s sharing economy has veered sharply away from how the term was originally defined: as a peer-to-peer exchange of underutilized goods and services. In China, \u201csharing\u201d now means almost any short-term rental of a product or service activated by a smartphone. Moreover, the things on offer, like Ofo\u2019s 6.5 million bikes, are not spread out among individuals but are owned by the tech companies themselves. The same is true for the spoils, from revenue to data. As a result, the ideals that still animate the concept in many other places \u2014 the reallocation of unused resources and the community that forms around it \u2014 are essentially absent in China. \u201cI was thrilled when I first heard China was so committed to the sharing economy,\u201d says April Rinne, an adviser who is a member of China\u2019s National Sharing Economy Commission. \u201cBut it\u2019s all so transactional, and the definition of sharing has gotten so broad that it\u2019s almost meaningless. As China defines it, even Amazon would be part of the sharing economy.\u201dWho can blame China for hanging on to the term \u201csharing economy\u201d? It fits with the image that Beijing wants to project: warm, generous, egalitarian. Robin Li, the chief executive of the internet giant Baidu, said last year that \u201cthe idea of a sharing economy is quite similar to that of a communist society,\u201d because both focus on \u201cdistribution according to need.\u201d A strategic planner at the advertising firm Havas Worldwide waxed so rhapsodic in a commentary about \u201cthe close-knit comradeship\u201d of Chinese consumers that it seemed the idea of sharing was itself a Chinese invention. \u201cThere is almost a sense of nobility garnered by having the means to own something yet deciding to share instead,\u201d the author wrote. The prize for puffery, however, goes to The People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, which in August celebrated umbrella-sharing enterprises as \u201ca show of human care, releasing the warmth of the city.\u201d A few weeks after that, nearly all 300,000 umbrellas distributed by a new company called Sharing E Umbrella had been either lost or stolen.None of China\u2019s bike-sharing companies are turning a profit yet. But even as they fight for market share, the data is the destination. \u201cCollecting data is the first goal of the sharing economy,\u201d says William Chou, the head of Deloitte\u2019s telecoms, media and technology practice in China. Every time consumers scan the QR code on a bicycle \u2014 or basketball, handbag, umbrella \u2014 they provide information about habits, locations, behaviors and payment histories. That\u2019s invaluable not just to Tencent and Alibaba but also to city planners seeking precise information about where to build roads, bridges and subways. \u201cThe fight is no longer over who has the biggest fleet,\u201d Towson says, \u201cbut who has the smartest fleet.\u201dThose are the benign side-effects of the sharing economy. But what happens as this data filters into China\u2019s new social-credit system, which promises to rate every individual by her financial, social and political worth? In fact, Beijing has authorized Tencent and Alibaba to conduct social-credit pilot testing, and their bikes serve as the perfect vehicles. There are no walls of privacy. The government has the ability to access company data, good or bad, faster than you can scan a QR code.One morning recently in Shanghai, I caught a glimpse of some suspicious behavior. I was walking down a tranquil, tree-lined street when a muscular man lumbered past carrying two orange-and-silver Mobikes. As he swept by, a wheel touched the ground and set off an alarm, causing him to heave the bikes even higher in the air. The man was not a bike enthusiast, but he wasn\u2019t a thief, either. As I watched him slip down a side alley and emerge moments later empty-handed, I realized that he was a foot soldier in the bike-sharing wars, dumping competitors\u2019 bikes in hard-to-find places. Rounding the corner, I saw the result of his handiwork: a sea of bikes in almost every hue. Yet not a single orange-and-silver Mobike was in sight.An earlier version of this article transliterated incorrectly a Chinese term that means \u201cthree rounds and sound.\u201d That term is sanzhuan yixiang, not sanshengyixiang.Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Available for purchase there is a wide variety of knockoff Nets merchandise, from jerseys to caps to T-shirts.The company said on Thursday that profit for its most recent quarter more than doubled compared with the same period a year ago, thanks in part to a 61 percent rise in revenue. By comparison, Amazon reported a 34 percent revenue increase for the same quarter.Still, the results released Thursday show that Alibaba still has ground to cover as it seeks to grow beyond e-commerce into more of a data and technology company. Apart from online shopping, its other businesses lost money.Alibaba\u2019s core business continues to be a money-spinner. That business generated nearly $3.6 billion in income during the quarter, about 50 percent more than a year ago. The company says nearly half a billion people now shop on its platforms annually.Alibaba has ranged far afield of e-commerce in recent years. It owns a movie studio, a soccer club and a Hong Kong newspaper, plus stakes in a variety of tech start-ups. The company is also spending $15 billion over the next several years on research in artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge fields.In the near term, though, investors are more interested in Alibaba\u2019s recently announced investment of the same amount in logistics. Alibaba has long depended on outside companies to deliver packages. But Jack Ma, the company\u2019s founder and executive chairman, has said his goal is to ship anywhere in China within 24 hours, and anywhere in the world within 72. That will require a lot of spending.Alibaba has found ways to make more money from its shopping platforms. For instance, better targeting of ads at customers has helped generate more interest \u2014 and sales \u2014 from advertisers.It has even opened its own grocery stores where purchases are made via smartphone app. These locations serve as hubs for delivering food to nearby homes, while also catering to shoppers who like to pick out fresh items, such as seafood, in person.Alibaba says it is not interested in building a large grocery chain, however. The company says it wants to showcase the ways traditional retailers can incorporate online tools into their business \u2014 with the hope that those retailers will then do so using tools and services provided by Alibaba.But those efforts are not close to eclipsing Alibaba\u2019s main businesses in China. In the latest quarter, Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce business earned about 90 percent of its revenue at home.Advertisement"}
