This ultimately results in higher prices and lower quality service for consumers.\u201dAT&T/DirecTV executives have concluded that the \u201crunway\u201d for the decline of traditional payTV \u201cmay be longer than some think given the economics of the space,\u201d and that it is \u201cupon us to utilize our assets to extend that runway.\u201dAT&T itself has previously stated that access to some of the most popular television programming is \u201ccritical to preserve and promote competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming.\u201d\u201cAfter reviewing DOJ\u2019s lawsuit against AT&T-Time Warner and watching AT&T\u2019s press conference, we still see a settlement as possible and, failing that, we believe AT&T would prevail in court.\u201d\u201cUnder my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,\u201d F.C.C. chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that\u2019s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate.\u201dThe move is a win for the giant telecoms like AT&T and Verizon as well as the big cable providers such as Comcast.\u201cThe losers could be internet sites that will have to answer telecom firms to get their content in front of consumers. And consumers may see their bills increase for the best quality of internet service.\u201dAndrew worked the phones yesterday and hears:Media executives at the other big content and distribution providers privately tell me that they hope AT&T and Time Warner do not find a way to settle. They are confident that the companies will win in court and hope that would put pressure on the Justice Department as it examines future deals.The telecommunications giant and its peers have lobbied hard against the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to prevent broadband providers from charging higher fees to access particular websites or online services like Netflix. Now the F.C.C. under Chairman Ajit Pai is poised to roll those initiatives back.Mr. Pai plans to accompany the repeal of net neutrality with several other measures that will also benefit broadband companies, said the people with knowledge of the matter. That includes suggesting that the Federal Trade Commission, which has traditionally not brought many cases, be the enforcement agency of net neutrality violations, they said.\u201cIt\u2019s not completely irrational to say the tax code is a disaster,\u201d Mr. Rattner said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here is that the importance of reforming the tax code trumps, excuse the pun, fixing the debt.\u201dBut Pete Peterson, the Blackstone co-founder and perhaps the most outspoken billionaire on the issue of the federal deficit, is having none of it. He told Andrew:\u201cMortgaging our fiscal future for trillions in temporary tax cuts will hurt our economy over time, and every C.E.O. should know that,\u201d he said. \u201cTrue business patriots need to advocate for their country as well as their company.\u201dThe European Union has already decided to move top regulatory agencies outside of London: The European Medicines Agency will leave London for Amsterdam, while the European Banking Authority will relocate to Paris.Its deal to buy as many as 24,000 self-driving Volvo vehicles reflects the ride-hailing giant\u2019s broad ambitions to make autonomous driving part of its future.\u201cThe only way we could control our own destiny was to work with this technology that had the potential to disrupt our business, and have direct involvement in the creation of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

McAtee II said in a statement:\u201cToday\u2019s DOJ lawsuit is a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrustprecedent. Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefitconsumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimatereason for our merger to be treated differently.\u201cFortunately, the Department of Justice doesn\u2019t havethe final say in this matter. Rather, it bears the burden of proving to the U.S. DistrictCourt that the transaction violates the law. We are confident that the Court will rejectthe Government\u2019s claims and permit this merger under longstanding legal precedent.\u201dAs the New York Times pointed out in August:\u201cThe Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, Chinese companies that dominate their home market, have rocketed this year to become global investor darlings...While American technology giants dominate people\u2019s online lives in Western countries, Tencent and Alibaba have soared by essentially carving up China, the world\u2019s single-largest internet market with more than 700 million online users.\u201d\u201cTheir rise is emblematic of a rebalancing of global technological influence. In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.\u201dThe world\u2019s largest banks have become better capitalized since financial crisis. They have raised more than $1.5 trillion in capital, according to the Financial Stability Board. That provides the banks with \u201cbuffers as much as 10x higher than a decade,\u201d writes S&P Global.But these financial instutions have also gotten much larger since the financial crisis.In the United States, for example, JPMorgan Chase has nearly doubled in size since the end of 2006. Bank of America has increased its asset by more than 50 percent, and Wells Fargo\u2019s assets are up more than 300 percent from their pre-crisis levels, according to S&P Global.Much of those increases are a result of deals struck during the heights of the crisis. JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual; Bank of America acquired CountryWide and Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo purchased Wachovia.Still the size of these banks is noteworthy. The \u2018too big to fail\u2019 distinction has drawn scrutiny from the Trump administration this year. A report from the Treasury Department last month \u201cdiscussed the need to eliminate regulation \u2018that fosters the creation or cements the market position of too-big-to-fail institutions\u2019 in order to prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts.\u201dA surprising percentage of respondents to DataTrek Research\u2019s bitcoin/cryptocurrency survey don\u2019t think so.\u2022 Just 39.4 percent of respondents said they believe bitcoin was in a bubble. \u201cWe were ready to see +70% responses indicating bitcoin\u2019s price is unsustainable. Less than 40% is, well, remarkable,\u201d writes DataTrek\u2019s co-founder Nicholas Colas.\u2022 Slightly more than 27 percent expect bitcoin to rise but at much slower pace. Just 16% think the value of bitcoin will double in the next six months.\u2022 \u201cA sizeable minority of respondents (39 \u2013 40 percent) see bitcoin as a potential analog to physical gold, both as a safe haven and a hedge against mistakes in central bank monetary policy,\u201d Mr. Colas writrs. Nearly 41 percent consider bitcoin a safe haven similar to gold, and 39 percent view bitcoin as a hedge against monetary policy.Would the Republican from Maine end up working to defeat the Senate\u2019s tax overhaul, as she did with attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act? Or would she simply lobby for changes to make it more acceptable?\u2022 \u201cIt is a simple but true concept, customers drive business growth, not tax rates, not mythical \u2018job creators.\u2019 Tax rates impact profitability, but are only very indirectly tied to hiring.\u201d\u2022 \u201cLabor markets determine salaries, not tax rates.\u201d\u2022 \u201cAs a C.E.O. and member of the board of directors at a public company, I can tell you that if we had an increase in profitability we would have been delighted but it would not lead in and of itself to more hiring or an increase in wages.\u201dThe euro has recovered from its initial decline after the news that Germans might have to go to the polls. But that hasn\u2019t eased the anxiousness of some market commentators.\u201cAngela Merkel\u2019s position seems to be significantly weakened. This could leave Europe\u2019s largest economy politically paralyzed for the time being, reducing the chances for any breakthrough in the E.U. reform agenda or the Brexit negotiations.\u201d\u201cEven if there are re-elections, that is very unlikely to be populist. That\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be a limited down reaction.\u201dAfter the financial crisis, the federal government was expected to aggressively pursue criminal cases against top financiers. Prosecutions were rare, except with obscure, or relatively junior, industry players against whom it was easy to build cases, because prosecutors were under pressure to move quickly and win cases.Philip Baker became one of those targets.He was not a big fish. But the desire to resolve the case swiftly led a powerful United States attorney to insert a transfer-to-Canada clause into an otherwise airtight plea agreement.In 2011, the government allowed Comcast to absorb NBCUniversal in another \u201charmless\u201d vertical merger (a deal that I opposed). Afterwards, Comcast was caught discriminating against rival cable channels and slowing down rival online video services. All the while, America tumbled down global broadband rankings. So much for \u201csynergies.\u201dUnlike Mr. Geithner, however, Mr. Lew already had a background in finance, having worked at Citigroup. The current Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was a partner at Goldman Sachs and a hedge fund founder before joining the Trump administration.The iPhone maker\u2019s vice president of diversity and inclusion, Denise Young Smith, is leaving after only six months in the role \u2014 and after she made controversial remarks about how she thinks of diversity extending beyond race and gender.\u201cI should take that as a compliment that I look like a villain in a great, successful James Bond movie.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T\u2019s C.E.O. Meets Trump\u2019s Justice", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI have no evidence that there\u2019s been inappropriate behavior. What I have is a really peculiar timeline.\u201dI\u2019m on the line with Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive. I\u2019ve heard other C.E.O.s offer up brutal judgments of this and previous administrations \u2014 invariably in off-the-record interviews. This one\u2019s on the record.Stephenson is battling the Justice Department, which this week sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner. The suit marks the first time in nearly 40 years that Justice has tried to quash such a deal, known as a vertical merger. The Obama administration approved a similar merger \u2014 one that brings together companies that don\u2019t compete and that offer different products and services \u2014 between Comcast and NBC Universal in 2011.That was before he got his current job. Once he did, Stephenson says, \u201cTemperatures change rather quickly, and Delrahim\u2019s own attitude changes rather quickly.\u201dIn other words, either Delrahim has miraculously seen the liberal light when it comes to vertical mergers, or he\u2019s channeling the wishes, implied or explicit, of the \u201cvery frustrated\u201d man who has made his feelings about the merger well known and could yet make him Sessions\u2019s successor.The government claims that the merged company could jack up prices on other distributors for must-watch content like H.B.O.\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d and that it would also \u201cslow the industry\u2019s transition to new and exciting video distribution models.\u201d But the arguments, Stephenson notes, are \u201cbizarre at best.\u201d\u201cOne has to assume two things,\u201d he says of the idea that the merger will lead to higher prices for consumers. \u201cThat [Time Warner subsidiary] Turner has market power, and that [AT&T subsidiary] DirecTV has market power.\u201d But with roughly 10 percent and 20 percent of their respective markets, they don\u2019t. As for the industry\u2019s \u201ctransition,\u201d has the government not heard of Amazon Prime?In the meantime, companies like Google and Facebook are gobbling up digital advertising dollars. \u201cHow do we compete with these guys?\u201d Stephenson wonders. \u201cIf we can\u2019t take someone with less than 10 percent of viewership and pair it with distribution, what can we do?\u201dThat\u2019s the economic question. Then there\u2019s the political one. Donald Trump makes no secret of his feelings about CNN, a Turner subsidiary. On Tuesday he reiterated his view that the merger was \u201cnot a good deal for the country.\u201dBut the circumstantial case that the Justice Department\u2019s decision is politically motivated is compelling. For conservatives, it\u2019s a fresh reminder that the administration\u2019s pro-business convictions go only as far as the president\u2019s convenience. A Sanders presidency would also have opposed the merger, though at least it would have done so honestly. What we have instead is economic policy conducted as an extension of presidential pique.As for liberals, those inclined to agree with Justice\u2019s decision should note how similar it is to the administration\u2019s curious outreach to Russia. The curiosity isn\u2019t that there is no rational argument for improving relations with Moscow or opposing the merger. It\u2019s that the argument is being made by an administration whose ideological instincts otherwise lean in the opposite direction.I ask Stephenson if the government\u2019s suit smacks of the kind of political risk multinational companies often face in autocratic countries such as Russia or Turkey, where the whims of the ruler have a way of translating into the judgment of regulators and courts.\u201cI don\u2019t know if there has been political interference, but it\u2019s logical to ask questions,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be na\u00efve not to.\u201dGail Collins is off today.Advertisement"}

Mr. Murdoch essentially created Sky in 1989, and the news channel was started the same year. Analysts have long believed that the media mogul would seek to take full control of the company.The takeover of Sky would give 21st Century Fox control of a Pan-European satellite network, as well as rights to additional content such as broadcasts of the English Premier League and other soccer leagues in parts of Europe. It would also help the American company take on digital rivals like Netflix and Amazon, whose streaming services are increasingly being used by customers on mobile devices.Mr. Murdoch tried to buy full control of Sky years ago, but that effort was abandoned as furor grew over a hacking scandal at the company, which was known then News Corporation. Since then, Mr. Murdoch split off 21st Century Fox from the rest of News Corp.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Modest Dressing, as a Virtue", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "What\u2019s really behind fashion\u2019s \u2014 and women\u2019s \u2014 love of concealing clothes?Supported byTo judge from Shafrir\u2019s tweet \u2014 and those that came after it \u2014 many women would appear to be skeptical of the current vogue for conservative, covered-up fashions. Only those blessed with the privileges money and slim good looks bring, these women seemed to suggest, could get away with wearing a dress that evokes virginal drabness at best and cult-style patriarchal oppression at worst; a dress which, with its sacklike silhouette, looks like a cross between a 1880s homesteading smock and the so-called bankruptcy barrel archetypically worn by old-timey hobos.There is something dispiriting (though perhaps not surprising, considering, for one, who America elected for president) about the ongoing need to consider such questions \u2014 after at least three waves of feminism have asserted a woman\u2019s right to self-determination over her own body, and, by extension, her clothing choices. Haven\u2019t we realized by now that women not only shouldn\u2019t be held responsible for men\u2019s misreading of their cues, but that, moreover, they might come to see their bodies and sexuality as a source of power to be reveled in rather than guarded? (Certainly, another recent leaning in fashion \u2014 that toward body positivity and acceptance \u2014 has been championing exposing rather than obscuring bodies of all sizes.)Still, Hoffman\u2019s perspective is familiar and understandable: Being a woman, one needs to frequently assess others\u2019 expectations over and against one\u2019s own. As the 21-year-old actress, writer and editor Tavi Gevinson told me, the relative modesty \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of her clothing choices reflects more than her own individual preferences. If she\u2019s going on an audition, she won\u2019t dress in what she called \u201ca frumpy art teacher look\u201d (a look, as she joked during our conversation, that could also be called \u201cBrooklyn mom\u201d or \u201cEuropean baby\u201d). Rather, \u201cI would dress in something that makes my figure look nice, because people are stupid, and most of the time when they say, \u2018We want her to come in again,\u2019 what they really mean is \u2018Wear something more conventionally attractive.\u2019\u2009\u201d In the publishing world, however, when Gevinson wants to be taken more seriously, as a thinker rather than a body, a dowdier look is helpful, so she can seem, she said, \u201cas if I\u2019ve somehow matured past a quote unquote juvenile desire to be perceived as a woman.\u201d The formula, then, is flipped, but not in a way that\u2019s necessarily more freeing.THE STATE OF wanting to be looked at is often mingled with self-consciousness about that very desire. I\u2019ve always thought that one of the reasons the \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d books continue to be popular with tween girls, many decades after they were first published, is that their presentation of the difficulties inherent to a girl\u2019s maturation into womanhood are mediated through the cushioning presence of yards of calico, wool and muslin. As a 10-year-old, excited but terrified at the prospect of my own encroaching puberty, reading the passages in \u201cLittle Town on the Prairie\u201d (1941) detailing, say, Mary Ingalls\u2019s going-away-to-college outfit, with its \u201cgored skirt of brown cashmere,\u201d and \u201coverskirt ... of brown-and-blue plaid\u201d not to mention its confusingly named \u201cflounced train\u201d and \u201cpleated flounce\u201d (were those one and the same?) acted as a balm, a calming litany; covered-up fashion, it seemed, could protect you from the grenade that your body was slowly but surely becoming.Navigating the world in a woman\u2019s body remains a fraught proposition in the most quotidian and granular of ways. And a woman with her body de-emphasized, with her conventional calling card scrapped \u2014 what a puzzle she is! I recall a couple of years ago walking in downtown Manhattan and spotting the writer Sheila Heti across the street. It was late fall, and as far as I can recall, Heti, whom I\u2019ve never met, was wearing a knee-length nubby coat over a long skirt and some practical lace-up shoes, all in varying shades of gray and brown. In all the more typical ways, she was looking maybe a little drab, maybe a little dowdy. And yet, there was something about her air that was enviable. There she was, walking along, her hair in a ponytail, carrying a book and swinging it at her side, as if without a care in the world. She seemed completely at home \u2014 and completely herself \u2014 in her essentially concealed body.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women\u2019s Whisper Network Raises Its Voice", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey called themselves the Glass Ceiling Club.A group of young and ambitious women in the 1990s from the investment bank Bear Stearns would gather at local restaurants every couple of months to discuss how to make the workplace more female friendly. The conversations would inevitably turn to their male colleagues, including the ones who behaved badly, said Maureen Sherry, a former managing director, who met regularly with the other women.\u201cOf course, our conversations would revert to sharing facts we knew about the men we worked with,\u201d recalled Ms. Sherry, who spent nine years at Bear Stearns before leaving in 2000, adding, \u201cyes, it was mostly the same men who preyed on young women.\u201dFor women who had to interact with some of the most notorious sexual harassers, Ms. Sherry said she recommended they stay on the trading floor \u2014 a very public space.\u201cSurvival hints like that were shared pretty freely,\u201d Ms. Sherry wrote in an email.That was the whisper network at work.For as long as women have been in the labor force, this kind of behind-the-scenes support system has served as a vital source of shared information and a safe space for communal commiseration. Advice on salary negotiations, office politics and the work-life balance would be disseminated through informal conversations at cubicles, in cafeterias and over drinks at happy hour.But the network also allowed employees to clue each other into a spectrum of behavior that was often unseen or ignored by their employers \u2014 the boss who scoffs at maternity leave, the manager known for ribald jokes, the colleague rumored to be a groper, or worse.Now, with the internet offering a clearinghouse for complaints \u2014 intensified by the outpouring of allegations against prominent figures like the producer Harvey Weinstein \u2014 whisper networks have been amplified. Through public forums, invitation-only Facebook groups, private Google surveys, locked websites and shielded threads on anonymous apps, women \u2014 and some men \u2014 are seeking catharsis and validation by sharing their stories.\u201cWe\u2019re in this interesting period right now, kind of a hopeful period, where having prominent people name and talk about harassment has put a heightened awareness of it on the table,\u2019\u2019 said Fatima Goss Graves, chief executive of the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\u201cWhen you have one person come forward, they become a huge target,\u201d she added, \u201cbut when more people come out, it\u2019s hard to go after all of them.\u201dIn many cases, the network is driven by firsthand knowledge. Other times, it can be pure speculation. Allegations are often made anonymously and can quickly spread in online forums, damaging reputations before the accused can defend themselves. Men targeted by whisper networks complain of being subject to vigilantism and public shaming; some have threatened legal action.At Bear Stearns \u2014 which was sold to JPMorgan Chase in 2008, during the financial crisis \u2014 the Glass Ceiling Club would warn others about the senior manager who had a history of affairs and a tendency to relocate his previous liaisons to remote offices, recalled Ms. Sherry, who last year published a semi-autobiographical novel, \u201cOpening Belle,\u2019\u2019 about her experiences.The women in the whisper network \u201cweren\u2019t best girlfriends,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Sherry said.\u201cWhat we did have in common was that we were ambitious professionals with the common goal of a more equal place of employment and so yes, that included our perplexity over outrageous behavior that went unchecked.\u201cBut when the whisper network moves onto social media platforms, accusations can gather momentum and quickly yield results.In early October, a number of women came forward on Twitter to accuse Andy Signore, the creator of the popular YouTube series \u201cHonest Trailers\u201d and \u201cScreen Junkies,\u201d of sexual harassment.In a statement through his lawyer, Yana Henriks, Mr. Signore denied any allegations of sexual assault, harassment or retaliation. He said that Defy Media used the allegations made against him as an opportunity to deprive him of his ownership stake in the company.Social media helps retain and spread what Ms. Graves, of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, calls \u201cinstitutional memory.\u201d A written story is easier to pass along than a spoken one, even if the original teller is anonymous, based in another office or leaves the company, she said.The invitation-only Facebook group Tech Ladies provides information on job openings and invitations to networking events. But it also has a discussion called #HelpASisterOut where members can solicit advice about how to come forward with a harassment complaint or to ask about a company\u2019s reputation or culture.\u201cWhat we\u2019ll see is someone post that they are applying for a job at a company and ask if anyone has any good or bad stories about it,\u201d said Allison Esposito, the founder of Tech Ladies. \u201cIf it was great, you\u2019ll see that in the comments. But if it wasn\u2019t, people will say \u2018DM me\u2019 or \u2018let\u2019s take it to the phone,\u2019 to share the information.\u201dAn app called Blind allows all employees from more than 100 companies, including Google, Facebook, Amazon and Airbnb, to sign up through their work email but then chat anonymously about office and industry issues.But in the past year, Blind has also become a hotbed for frank talk about sexual harassment.Outlets now abound for women \u2014 especially younger, newer employees \u2014 who might be left out of tightly guarded cliques of trust at work.In private Facebook groups, women in the comedy profession share a list of men who have been banned from various venues across the country for inappropriate sexual behavior.The anonymity attached to some allegations has spurred debate. A Google spreadsheet that named dozens of men in the media world, identifying individuals with descriptions ranging from leering to sexual harassment to assault, drew a mixed reaction when it was publicized in October.Some applauded the public outing of the men who were accused. But others were outraged that the document had been widely disseminated, that the allegations had been made anonymously and the accused given no opportunity to defend or remove themselves from the list.For Amanda Aiken, the whisper network worked. Sort of.Ms. Aiken was a new paralegal at a small Canadian real estate investment firm when, during a company event in 2011, a top executive repeatedly tried to cajole her into going back to his home.\u201cHis entire body was touching mine \u2014 I would try to get away from him, physically move away, and he would try to follow me,\u201d she recalled in an interview.In the following days, she learned that several other female colleagues had similar stories, including her friend, Erin Carson. After word filtered up to management, the women were soon summoned to a meeting with one of the company\u2019s owners to discuss their allegations.\u201cThere was some anger, there were some tears,\u201d Ms. Carson, a receptionist at the firm in Victoria, B.C., said in an interview. \u201cBut it was kind of reassuring to know we weren\u2019t alone.\u201dThe executive left the company soon afterward. Ms. Aiken quit her job, citing a lingering feeling of awkwardness.\u201cToo many women have commented about how they just gave up because men didn\u2019t listen when we said no and we felt powerless,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to get my power back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Blocking the AT&T-Time Warner Merger Might Be Right", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut should we so quickly conclude that the Justice Department is doing something wrong? Maybe not.We don\u2019t have the information that the Justice Department has, but here\u2019s how the Time Warner-AT&T deal would be anticompetitive. AT&T is one of the two dominant wireless carriers in the United States (Verizon is the other). However, it faces competitive threats, particularly from T-Mobile, whose cost-cutting and ability to lure subscribers has hurt AT&T\u2019s profits (while saving consumers money). During the Obama era, AT&T\u2019s proposed solution to that annoyance was to attempt to buy T-Mobile. But the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission killed that deal. Acquiring Time Warner is an alternative: It gives AT&T a new way to hurt T-Mobile and other potential competitive threats.AT&T\u2019s 2016 deal with Taylor Swift offers a preview of the strategy. AT&T made an \u201conly on AT&T\u201d deal with Ms. Swift to release her future music videos to devoted fans, contingent on their signing up with AT&T. With ownership of Time Warner, AT&T gets a lot more content with which to play that game. It would include HBO shows like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Warner Bros. movies like the \u201cBatman\u201d franchise, as well as the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and CNN.Though restricting HBO to just AT&T customers wouldn\u2019t make financial sense, there are many things that AT&T could do with HBO and other programming to hurt rivals, like raising the prices for it, creating AT&T-exclusive programming and perhaps completely preventing rivals like Dish, DirecTV\u2019s satellite competitor, from buying its programs. This strategy would take advantage of the erosion or revocation of net-neutrality rules by the Trump administration, allowing AT&T to explicitly favor its own content over others.There are numerous political and free speech concerns that come when those who control \u201cthe pipes\u201d that distribute content also control the programming and news operations. Companies that controlled both the distribution and production of news programs could have enough power to influence elections. In theory, the F.C.C. should intervene to prevent such abuses, but the current commission has shown zero interest in what was once called \u201cthe public interest.\u201dIn short, there are good reasons for the Justice Department to be concerned about this merger. Yes, the department over the past two decades has allowed many mega-mergers or taken tepid steps to restrict them through consent decrees. But the department is capable of learning from its mistakes, and the consensus now is that consent decrees don\u2019t work. Moreover, in recent years the department has blocked several big mergers, including between Comcast and Time Warner Cable, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, and Anthem and Cigna. Tough scrutiny of an AT&T-Time Warner deal would continue that trend.The unfortunate fact is that Mr. Trump has engendered so much distrust in government that everything that any federal agency does these days seems questionable. The problem is compounded by the extreme secrecy that has surrounded merger reviews. In fact, the secrecy surrounding mergers exceeds that for almost any other public process with major economic impact. Even the Federal Reserve occasionally explains its decisions to Congress.If the Justice Department is, in fact, doing its job appropriately and not behaving as Mr. Trump\u2019s henchman, it should be willing to show us how. It ought to explain its concerns about the merger to the public and to Congress.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the companies in a merger blocked by the Justice Department. The attempted merger would have been of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, not Comcast and Time Warner.Tim Wu, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads,\u201d is a professor at Columbia Law School and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Barbra Streisand\u2019s Misty, Water-Colored Memories in a Netflix Concert Film", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingA few brief testimonials from her music director and her longtime manager later, the show begins. Directed by Ms. Streisand and the veteran music filmmaker Jim Gable, it is a relatively straightforward chronicle and, if you\u2019re watching closely enough, a bracing lesson in how far the concert movie has progressed since Martin Scorsese raised the bar for the genre with \u201cThe Last Waltz,\u201d his 1978 documentary about the Band, and Jonathan Demme raised it higher still with \u201cStop Making Sense,\u201d his 1984 Talking Heads film.The theme of Ms. Streisand\u2019s show, filmed last December in Miami, is summed up in its title. It\u2019s a bit of a nostalgia fest. Ms. Streisand has long struggled with stage fright, but you\u2019d never know it from the easy, relaxed way she interacts with her adoring audience before belting out her opening number, \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d (Whether she still deals with stage fright or not, Ms. Streisand appears very confident in her self-presentation backstage; in the preshow section, she sits before a mirror and tells the camera how she has always done her own makeup, reminiscing about convincing the makeup artist on her debut film, \u201cFunny Girl,\u201d that Ms. Streisand really did know best.)A mezzo-soprano of what you might call wide-screen expressiveness, Ms. Streisand has a little more grit and grain in her voice than she used to, but like the master that she is, she makes it work for her. And when she brings her songs to their big moments \u2014 she does excel at those that are meant to be acted as well as sung, like Stephen Sondheim\u2019s \u201cBeing Alive\u201d \u2014 the movie delivers a montage assembled from the views of multiple cameras, one swooping in on Ms. Streisand, another pulling back, another fixed in close-up, another taking in the band, finally settling on a shot of an understandably ecstatic audience.The show itself is both intimate and grand. Ms. Streisand sits herself at a little table with a teapot and cup atop it and tells some stories before or after a song. \u201cTo give you an idea of how long ago that was,\u201d she says after one anecdote, \u201cit was when a tweet was what a bird did, and the only people who had cell numbers were in jail.\u201d That\u2019s typical of her patter. She\u2019ll also sit near a piano. But when she\u2019s going for big effects, her tech department delivers: It simulates a lightning storm during \u201cPapa, Can You Hear Me?\u201d a song from the 1983 film \u201cYentl.\u201dA lot of the memories she addresses in the show are movie related. Ms. Streisand was a defining leading lady in \u201960s, \u201970s and even \u201980s films, stretching across various genres. At the show she speaks with genuine reverence for William Wyler, who directed \u201cFunny Girl\u201d (1968), adapted from the 1964 Broadway show that made her a star. She remembers his openness to her ideas. She also pays brief tribute to Harry Stradling Sr., the cinematographer for \u201cFunny Girl\u201d and three subsequent pictures she starred in. A video montage of stills shows Ms. Streisand consulting with the directors Peter Bogdanovich in \u201cWhat\u2019s Up, Doc?,\u201d Irvin Kershner in \u201cUp the Sandbox,\u201d and Sydney Pollack in \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201dThose collaborations were part of her road to taking up directing, which she first did with \u201cYentl.\u201d She had become a producer well before that, with the 1976 film \u201cA Star Is Born.\u201d During her chat with the audience, she brings up a 1987 movie, \u201cNuts,\u201d a drama she also produced (she plays a prostitute on trial for killing a john). \u201cInteresting picture, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she says to the audience.It\u2019s in one respect the sign of a true star that every picture he or she is in, good or bad, is always interesting. That\u2019s the case with Ms. Streisand. But one side effect of watching \u201cBarbra: The Music \u2026 the Mem\u2019ries \u2026 the Magic!\u201d was to make me want to catch up on some of her films. And there aren\u2019t any on Netflix. (The company has made some progress in programming synergy: Upon releasing \u201cOur Souls at Night,\u201d starring Robert Redford and Jane Fonda, the streaming service also ran \u201cBarefoot in the Park\u201d and \u201cThe Electric Horseman,\u201d older films featuring both actors. But more can be done, obviously.)Amazon Video has a fair number of Streisand films, none free with Amazon Prime but all at reasonable prices ($2.99 to 3.99 for rental, $8.99 to $9.99 to own). \u201cYentl\u201d and Ms. Streisand\u2019s other directorial features, \u201cThe Prince of Tides\u201d (1991) and \u201cThe Mirror Has Two Faces\u201d (1996), are there, as is \u201cFunny Girl,\u201d still a very exuberant feature-length set piece. \u201cNuts,\u201d \u201cThe Way We Were\u201d and \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d a movie that\u2019s both a look at 1970s excess and, in its over-the-top messiness, a kind of symptom of it, are also available.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Taylor Swift Stream? Music Industry Is Left to Guess", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWill she or won\u2019t she?As the music world awaits the release of Taylor Swift\u2019s new album, \u201cReputation,\u201d on Friday, the industry has been preoccupied with a guessing game: Will it be immediately available on streaming services?With streaming now contributing nearly two-thirds of the revenue of the recording industry in the United States, few artists would even consider withholding their music from outlets like Spotify and Apple Music.Yet as the release date for \u201cReputation\u201d approached, four executives at major streaming services said they did not expect the album to be made available for streaming, at least at first. But those executives, who spoke anonymously to protect private negotiations, said that plans could change at any time.But those battles have long since been settled; Ms. Swift starred in Apple commercials and returned her catalog to Spotify. So will her fans be able to find \u201cReputation\u201d there \u2014 and on streaming outlets like Amazon and Tidal \u2014 on Friday? Or will they have to wait?Ms. Swift and her label, Big Machine, have not announced their plans, and a spokeswoman for the star declined to comment.The fact that Ms. Swift can keep the industry on edge shows her extraordinary power. Her apparent lack of commitment to streaming also shows that although streaming has taken over listening habits, it is still not fully embraced by artists as a satisfactory source of income.\u201cTaylor Swift is one of the few artists who has the combination of star power and fan cultivation to truly drive how her music is consumed,\u201d said Vickie Nauman, an industry consultant and former digital music executive.By most analyses, these have been financial calculations: It would take 150 streams of every song on a 10-track album to equal the revenue of a single CD sale, according to standard industry estimates.Beyonc\u00e9, perhaps the only other comparable artist, has kept her latest record, \u201cLemonade,\u201d from streaming on Apple and Spotify, but her reasons may be competitive \u2014 she is a partner in Tidal, the streaming service controlled by Jay-Z.Through a partnership with Ticketmaster, Ms. Swift has told fans that they can \u201cboost your place in line\u201d for tickets to her concert tour by purchasing CDs and merchandise.\u201cI anticipate she will hold it from streaming until she hits some sales mark,\u201d said Stephanie Kellar, an associate professor at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, \u201cand then she will revisit that decision.\u201dBy contrast, many hip-hop albums, which now dominate streaming, do not release a CD version at first, potentially leaving money on the table.For those who have been watching Spotify closely, there have been signs of a lack of promotion of Ms. Swift\u2019s music. When she released a new track, \u201cCall It What You Want,\u201d last week, the song did not appear on Spotify\u2019s popular \u201cNew Music Friday\u201d playlist.Graham James, a spokesman for Spotify, declined to comment on whether the service would have Ms. Swift\u2019s album. When asked about the song\u2019s absence from its playlist, he said, \u201cOur policy is to work with artists and managers who want to work with us to connect with their millions of fans on Spotify.\u201dRepresentatives for Apple, Amazon and Tidal declined to comment.For Ms. Swift, absence from streaming \u2014 where the bulk of listening now occurs, especially for young people \u2014 carries an additional risk of shunning the market. The album\u2019s first single, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d went to No. 1 and logged hundreds of millions of streams, but successive songs have missed the mark. \u201c \u2026 Ready for It?,\u201d for example, released shortly thereafter, stalled at No. 4 and has been streamed a moderate 93 million times on Spotify.If Ms. Swift decides to withhold her music from streaming services, her lead may be followed by other artists, Professor Kellar said, but likely not with the same success.\u201cShe will not be the last one to do it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut she is one of the few that can.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He created a nonprofit group, the Progressive Agenda Committee, to support his cause but that group went defunct after his efforts to play a significant role in the 2016 presidential campaign flopped.By framing the Trump presidency as a clear and present danger to New York, Mr. de Blasio gave himself a road he could take to eventually break the bonds of his own local political career. Mayors have repeatedly tried to run for office outside of the five boroughs, only to be thwarted. Mayor Edward I. Koch tried unsuccessfully to run for governor. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani tried for president, to no avail. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg explored a presidential run, too, before ultimately decided against it.\u201cHe can gaze to Washington \u2014 as long as he\u2019s focused here,\u201d said Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller who also stood for re-election on Tuesday.9 PhotosMichael Morey, another Democratic strategist in New York, added: \u201cThe second term, without the necessity of worrying about re-election as New York City mayor, is going to free him to try to do what he tried to do in the first term, which was become a national progressive voice. He will be much more unencumbered.\u201d\u201cWe offer Amazon the greatest city in the world,\u201d he said.Likewise, on Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio remained unaffected by would-be critics. Protesters who want to close the jails on Rikers Island far sooner than the mayor\u2019s timeline surrounded Mr. de Blasio\u2019s polling site in Park Slope, Brooklyn, but the mayor arrived through the back door.Later, after voting, the mayor and his wife, Chirlane McCray, decamped to their favorite neighborhood patisserie. For a half-hour, they enjoyed espresso and pastries at their corner table, interrupted intermittently by selfies.\u201cDid you vote yet?\u201d the mayor would ask patrons. \u201cWe need your vote today.\u201dOn his way out, the mayor said not to expect him to break from routines in a second term, even those for which he has sustained some criticism.\u201cNo changing who we are,\u201d he beamed widely.J.

Before the current wave of accusations and apologies and denials and therapy commitments hit, tales of harassment were aired through celebrity gossip sites and warned about in whisper networks. They were also exorcised through television plotlines. In the past year, even as some of the industry\u2019s biggest abusers still lurked in the shadows, shows like \u201cMaster of None,\u201d \u201cGirls\u201d and \u201cOne Mississippi\u201d all grappled with the role of the bystander \u2014 the person who knows something, but isn\u2019t sure quite what to do about it.But the bystander\u2019s responsibility is more ambivalent than the headlines suggest. We\u2019ve now been inundated with images of victims bravely coming forward and abusers cowering behind legalese, but the role of the bystander still lacks a clear social script. We\u2019ve yet to hash out a consensus on when third parties have a moral obligation to speak on behalf of a victim, confront a friend, or relay rumors to higher ups. Perhaps that\u2019s why the bystander\u2019s predicament has lent itself so handily to comedy, particularly the kind of dark prestige dramedies that make moral and sexual ambiguity their playgrounds.Dev is always trying to be the good guy, then bumbling into situations where supporting women ends up unexpectedly deflating his own male privilege. In the first season, Dev is cast in a hardware store ad, and at a bar after shooting one day, he drunkenly opines to the director that the ad feels sexist because it exclusively stars men. When Dev reports to set the next day, he finds that his role has been recast with a woman, a new \u201cdirection\u201d inspired by Dev\u2019s woke observations. A miffed Dev asks: \u201cIs there another direction where I don\u2019t get fired and lose a bunch of money?\u201dIn Season 2, Dev seeks out one of Jeff\u2019s targets \u2014 a former makeup artist on his show \u2014 and suggests that she report the harassment to network higher-ups. When she declines, he respects her decision not to speak up. Then she writes a blog post that sets off a public reckoning, and \u201cChef Jeff Is a Perv\u201d starts trending on Twitter. Even then, Dev can\u2019t bring himself to confront the oblivious Jeff. Instead they step onto a live talk show set to make paella and promote \u201cBest Food Friends.\u201d When the news breaks on live TV, a chyron pops under Dev\u2019s image that reads: \u201cDEV SHAH: Sexual predator Chef Jeff\u2019s \u2018BFF.\u2019\u201d As Chef Jeff storms offset, Dev lies: \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about this!\u201d\u201cMaster of None\u201d reveals how it\u2019s often easier to support a woman in the abstract than it is to actually condemn a man, especially if that guy is your blustering celebrity boss. It\u2019s not just female underlings who are socialized to be nice and agreeable to guys like that, and when placed under their power, it\u2019s often more instinctual to freeze than fight. When you lend an ear to a victim who\u2019s not ready to go public, it\u2019s hard to know how to keep her secret without also protecting her harasser \u2014 and making your own reputation vulnerable when the truth comes out.In February, HBO\u2019s \u201cGirls\u201d aired its own harassment episode, one focused on the confusing experience of getting to know \u2014 and like \u2014 an alleged predator. In \u201cAmerican Bitch,\u201d the fictional novelist Chuck Palmer (Matthew Rhys) invites Hannah Horvath (Ms. Dunham) to his fancy uptown apartment to confront her about an article she wrote about him in a \u201cniche feminist blog.\u201d Hannah has collected a handful of online accusations from young female fans whom Chuck has lured into questionably consensual sexual encounters by leveraging his fame.That episode collapses an entire relationship into an afternoon: Though Hannah is standoffish at first, Chuck draws her into an intimate exchange in which he challenges her journalism, flatters her intelligence, scrounges for sympathy, plies her with gifts, and then \u2014 oops \u2014 pulls out his penis. The episode ends with Chuck\u2019s preteen daughter coming home, and Chuck using her presence to forestall any further discussion about what\u2019s just happened.Hannah and Chuck\u2019s encounter dances around some unspoken dynamics of harassment. The power game can be as mental as it is physical. Often men who hurt women help women in other ways, and that can be self-serving too \u2014 supporting women\u2019s work might open up new opportunities to take advantage of them, woo them with flattery that ends up entrapping them in a kind of complicity, or help shield the men\u2019s reputations against unseemly accusations. Mostly, the episode questions whether knowing a man personally can help clarify the strength of allegations against him. In fact, it seems to obscure the question: The more Chuck becomes known to Hannah, the more the women who accused him become abstracted. Hannah\u2019s not thinking about them when she\u2019s laughing and talking with him, and neither are we.But what\u2019s good for one woman isn\u2019t necessarily good for women in general. Doing good doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve never done anything bad. And as Ms. Dunham so smartly explored in \u201cGirls,\u201d knowing someone isn\u2019t the same as knowing what they\u2019ve done; abusers can conceal their crimes even from their closest friends. Ms. Dunham has since apologized for putting a \u201cthumb on the scale\u201d in the unresolved case. But her example shows that even the most carefully aligned politics can be overwhelmed by the pull of personal and professional relationships \u2014 especially in Hollywood, where every connection is fortified with influence and wealth.\u201cOne Mississippi\u201d stars Ms. Notaro as a radio personality with a complicated relationship to her Mississippi hometown. When a producer at her network masturbates in front of a co-worker and friend, Kate (played by her real-life spouse, Stephanie Allynne) Tig goes on a rampage on her behalf. She storms into the masturbator\u2019s office (he denies it), then brings Kate to tell their boss. He finds the account hard to believe, he says, because the masturbator is \u201cso progressive!\u201d Finally, Tig is on the verge of outing the masturbator live on her radio show when Kate reminds her that she doesn\u2019t have the license to publicly air Kate\u2019s experience. So Tig takes to the airwaves to tell her own story, of being molested by her step-grandfather as a child.There\u2019s something inviting about taking on sexual harassment in a 30-minute comedic sprint, either as a bottle episode (like the one in \u201cGirls\u201d) or a finale plot twist (as in \u201cMaster of None\u201d). If the victim and accuser are minor enough characters, and the behavior less horrendous than rape it allows the creator to nod to the problem without having to deal with its ramifications all season long.Also this year, harassment showed up as a role-reversal gag in an episode of NBC\u2019s \u201cGreat News,\u201d in which a female TV exec (played by Tina Fey) starts performatively harassing her employees in a bid to land a big payout like the ones afforded Roger Ailes and Bill O\u2019Reilly. The only problem is that her co-workers are too cowardly and confused to actually report her. The exasperated executive confesses to her foiled plan and rebukes them for not taking a stand (and getting her a payday). Another Tina Fey show, \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d dispenses of its own harassment plotline in a scene: Titus (Tituss Burgess) auditions for his dream job on \u201cSesame Street\u201d only to get an uncomfortable quid-pro-quo request from Mr. Frumpus, the (fictional) old man neighbor puppet. Titus scampers out of the audition. Bit over.It seems unlikely that these more fleeting television moments would be scripted exactly this way today. When the details about big-name industry abusers were still in the shadows of the popular consciousness, it allowed for some comedic freedom. Sexual harassment could safely be raised as a serious-but-not-too-serious offense, one that might allow for some nuance in the telling. But now that the grave details of abuse lodged against people like Harvey Weinstein have been made clear, they feel too weighty to play around with, at least for now. \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d the rare show to commit to its harassment story line, feels like the series best equipped to respond to this moment. In fact, the show has already doubled down, using the masturbation incident to explore the wider scope of sexual violence against women and girls. It\u2019s earned the license to keep telling the story.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Tech Start-Ups Mature, So Do Their Headquarters", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare Feet\u201cThe sarcastic joke is that our headquarters has one of the farthest walks to a Starbucks in Seattle \u2014 a quarter of a mile away,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cBut it was a fast-paced real estate search to find space and not lose out on the opportunity.\u201dSimilar space races are happening in tech-oriented markets around the country, and like the decision of F5 Networks to move into a top tier, or \u201ctrophy,\u201d building, more maturing tech companies are a main driver of occupancy in newer high-end offices. That\u2019s a departure from the days when tech start-ups preferred old warehouses and office buildings converted into wide-open loft offices. Full of exposed brick, wooden beams, high ceilings and concrete floors, the funky work spaces gave birth to tech enclaves in places like San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood and Manhattan\u2019s Flatiron district.Tenants in the technology, creative and media industries leased more than 8.5 million square feet in trophy buildings in the United States over the 12 months that ended in the first quarter of 2017, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, the Chicago-based commercial real estate brokerage firm. That amounted to 22 percent of all trophy space leased over the period, a year-over-year increase of seven percentage points. It was also second only to the banking and finance sector in total square feet leased.Recent notable tech deals include Facebook\u2019s lease of 436,000 square feet in a new office and residential tower in downtown San Francisco, Spotify\u2019s lease of 378,000 square feet in 4 World Trade Center in Manhattan and HomeAway\u2019s lease of an entire 315,000-square-foot office building under construction in the Domain mixed-use neighborhood in Austin, Tex.But companies in all sectors today \u2014 not just tech \u2014 are demanding the design elements typically found in the warehouse conversions, such as open floor plans, natural light and exposed ceilings. Along with proximity to transit and amenities, layout is considered an important tool to recruit and retain workers, and developers are obliging tenants in new buildings and those in retrofitted older buildings, particularly modern offices built in the 1980s and later.\u201cIt turns out that we look really smart,\u201d said Mr. Daniels, whose early efforts to develop the Mark were halted by the Great Recession. \u201cBut it was kind of nerve-racking at the time.\u201dReal estate professionals say older buildings generally lack modern energy efficiencies, elevators, bathrooms and data capabilities. The inability to expand in the converted buildings and their scarcity are also restrictive.\u201cWe\u2019re creating an atmosphere of fun, fitness and food, because that\u2019s what tenants are looking for,\u201d Mr. Meghji said. \u201cThe role of landlords has evolved \u2014 today it\u2019s about providing an experience.\u201dMr. Daniels added a hotel and event space to the Mark when he resumed development after the recession. The additions appealed to F5 Networks, which ended up leasing 516,000 square feet of space. The changes helped round out the building\u2019s amenity package, which includes lounges, restaurants and a fitness facility.\u201cIt all brings a lot more life after 5,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \u201cThe younger set really likes to be entertained \u2014 at all times \u2014 whether it\u2019s by food, drink or games. They\u2019ve got to have it.\u201d\u201cSan Francisco certainly has morphed into more of a \u2018big tech\u2019 market, and the companies are all looking at new buildings,\u201d Mr. Sammons said. \u201cI think landlords are feeling much more confident in the market\u2019s long term than they were a couple of years ago, when many tech tenants were start-ups.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Technologies That Will Rock Your World", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is reason for concern, but also for optimism. The new wave of artificial intelligence will reduce jobs, but will also improve your health and products like your smartphone. Here are five areas where tech companies, large and small, will change the way we live.Such technology will improve health care in places where doctors are scarce. But eventually, it will streamline care in the developed world as well. Google is already running tests inside two hospitals in India, and the start-up Infervision has deployed similar technology in hospitals across China.In the longer term, similar methods promise to rapidly accelerate drug discovery and so many other aspects of health care. \u201cEverything from the nature of the food that we grow and eat to the drugs that we give ourselves to how we monitor the impact of these things is all being transformed by A.I. in deeply profound ways,\u201d said Matt Ocko, a managing partner at DCVC, a San Francisco venture capital firm that has invested heavily in this area.Neural networks are not limited to image recognition. Far from it. These same techniques are rapidly improving coffee-table gadgets like the Amazon Echo, which can recognize spoken commands from across the room, and online services like Skype, which can instantly translate phone calls from one language to another. They may even eventually produce machines that can carry on a conversation.Recently, said Luke Zettlemoyer, a University of Washington professor, there has been a \u201chuge phase shift\u201d in the area of natural language understanding \u2014 technology that understands the natural way people talk and write. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are at the forefront of this movement, which promises to fundamentally change how we interact with phones, cars, and potentially any machine. Many companies are moving down the same path, including Replika, a San Francisco start-up.With help from machine learning, Replika offers a smartphone \u201cchatbot\u201d that acts as a kind of personal confidante, chatting with you in moments when no one else is around. But the hope is that these techniques will improve to where they serve you in so many other ways. What if Alexa was truly conversational, if you could have a back and forth dialogue? Right now, it is about basic questions and commands. Today, it \u201crecognizes\u201d words very very well. But truly \u201cunderstanding\u201d complex English sentences is beyond machines at this point. What if machines could carry on a dialogue like Hal in 2001?Using electroencephalography, or EEG \u2014 a longstanding means of measuring electrical brain activity from sensors placed on the head \u2014 the start-up Neurable is building a virtual reality game that can be played with the mind. EEG is limited for this kind of use, but other researchers, including at Facebook, aim to build a far more powerful systems using optical sensors. Facebook hopes that, in a few years, this technology will let people type with their minds five times faster than they can with a smartphone keyboard.These techniques will also face physical limits, and that may bar the way to Facebook\u2019s goal. But various start-ups, including Neuralink, founded by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, are going several steps further, hoping to read brain activity from chips implanted inside the skull. At first, they will limit this technology to people with disabilities. But ultimately, Mr. Musk and others hope to also implant chips in healthy people.\u201cIt is implausible that this technology would go straight into healthy people,\u201d said Ed Boyden, an M.I.T. neuroscientist who is also an adviser to Neuralink. \u201cBut there is a natural trajectory where, if a medical technology proves effective, it can move into normal individuals as well.\u201dWant more science fiction in your everyday reality? As entrepreneurs like Mr. Musk work to put a chip in your head, others are working to put cars in the skies.At first, Kitty Hawk will sell its vehicles to hobbyists. But the company hopes it can eventually convince the general public, and regulators, that flying cars make sense. That is no easy task. After all, these cars will require a new kind of air traffic control.Even more outlandish? It\u2019s the prospect of a quantum computer. Drawing on the seemingly magical properties of quantum physics, such a machine would be exponentially more powerful than computers of today. Think of it this way: A quantum computer could instantly crack the encryption that protects the world\u2019s most private data.The problem is that these machines are enormously difficult to build. but progress has accelerated. Google, IBM and Intel are investing heavily in this push, as are start-ups like Rigetti Computing.Researchers say they believe that quantum machines eventually could accelerate drug discovery, streamline financial markets, solve traffic problems and more.\u201cIt is a completely different paradigm for processing information,\u201d said Robert Schoelkopf, who helped invent the techniques that are driving so much of quantum computing research. \u201cSo we think that known applications are just the tip of the iceberg.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No Apologies Needed.", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThis will be anathema to stage purists, but here goes: I like watching theater on television.Of course, it is not the real thing. There is no smell of the greasepaint, no roar of the crowd. There is no sense of the actors\u2019 physical presence, their breathing and sweat, the way they physically interact with one another. There is no communal joy.But there is theater, and that is something.For many of us growing up in the analog era without access to the stage, television was the only resource. New Yorkers of a certain age would have been familiar with the series \u201cPlay of the Week,\u201d which was broadcast in 1959-61, and with PBS\u2019s \u201cAmerican Playhouse,\u201d from 1982-1994. I grew up in rural France with just three channels, but at least they regularly showed classics and middlebrow comedies; I learned to enjoy both.Now I see a lot of live theater, and yet I still love it on the small screen. Partly so I can see productions that don\u2019t make it to New York, and partly because, although theater is distinguished by the uniqueness of the moment, sometimes you just want to rewind that moment as soon as it\u2019s over.As the Thanksgiving weekend rolls around, with its abundant downtime, here are some online destinations for theater on-demand. Feel free to use your cellphone whenever you want and to crinkle candy wrappers \u2014 nobody will mind.And then there are BroadwayHD\u2019s non-American offerings. I admit turning the volume way up for the fantastically gaudy 2012 British arena tour of \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d starring Tim Minchin, while the West End\u2019s \u201cGypsy\u201d with Imelda Staunton allows us to add a contender to the evergreen argument over who is the best Mama Rose.I barely scratched the surface of subtitled productions, but did enjoy \u201cLa Casa de Bernarda Alba,\u201d a classic from Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca that is rarely produced on English-language stages. This also gave me the opportunity to discover the Argentine stage veteran Mar\u00eda Rosa Fugazot, whose raspy voice is a thing of wonder.This relatively new outfit rewards open-minded explorers, especially those with many stamps in their passports: Little of the material on offer is American.This alone would make Cennarium stand out, but in September it broke new ground with Promenade, a virtual 10-day festival that attempted to foster appointment streaming by broadcasting simultaneous shows every night at 8 p.m. Promenade even tried to create a virtual community with hosts introducing the shows and chat rooms where viewers could discuss what they had just seen.This would have been a godsend to 14-year-old me, alone in the boondocks \u2014 and it might just be a lifeline to isolated arts lovers around the world. We can only hope there will be more Promenades in the future.Catalog items right now include the David Esbjornson production of \u201cDriving Miss Daisy,\u201d featuring the original stars James Earl Jones and Boyd Gaines, but with Angela Lansbury replacing Vanessa Redgrave \u2014 a rather drastic, yet fascinating, switcheroo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Make Sense of the U.S. Case Against AT&T-Time Warner", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAT&T and Time Warner are trying to merge into a nationwide internet, satellite television and media powerhouse.Here is what you need to know to make sense of the government\u2019s case:Why was the government\u2019s decision such a surprise?AT&T and Time Warner do not directly compete against each other. So their combination, known in the business world as a vertical merger, would not reduce the number of companies in the telecommunications or media markets. That is a key test of competition for antitrust officials.For about four decades mergers like this one passed regulatory muster, notably Comcast\u2019s union with NBC in 2011 and Time Warner\u2019s merger with AOL in 2000. The Justice Department has been more critical of mergers between companies that directly compete, what antitrust officials call horizontal mergers. In 2015, the agency blocked another Comcast deal, that time to buy Time Warner Cable, a cable company that is a separate company from Time Warner. The agency said that combining the two cable and broadband providers would reduce options for consumers and have too much power.Then why are antitrust officials doing this? Makan Delrahim, less than two months into his job as the head of the antitrust division at the Justice Department, has arrived with a very different approach to merger reviews.He has said that he is not opposed to vertical mergers in general. But he said he disagreed with how anticompetitive concerns for these deals have been handled in the past.Traditionally, antitrust officials have addressed concerns by making companies agree to abstain from anticompetitive practices. In the case of the Comcast-NBC Universal deal, Comcast promised to share NBC programming with streaming companies like Netflix, for example. These sort of arrangements are called behavioral remedies.But Mr. Delrahim believes that those agreements are difficult to police and often do not work. If there are anticompetitive harms, he says, the companies should be willing to sell off assets to allay those concerns.Why does Mr. Delrahim criticize behavioral remedies?Mr. Delrahim, a Republican who served at the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration, believes the government should not expend a lot of resources on merger enforcement. He thinks consent decrees with behavioral conditions turn the Justice Department into a regulatory agency that has to police those settlements for years.In a speech at the American Bar Association this month, Mr. Delrahim said, \u201cLike any regulatory scheme, behavioral remedies require centralized decisions instead of a free market process.\u201d He added that if a deal is anticompetitive, \u201cwe should only accept a clean and complete solution.\u201dAre regulators rethinking antitrust more broadly?Corporate consolidation, particularly in the tech and media sectors, has become a bipartisan concern. Lawmakers say they are worried about the power of Facebook over public opinion and Amazon\u2019s great reach across retail, media, and business services like cloud storage.There is a call for regulators to think more creatively about antitrust. A common test for antitrust officials is whether customers will be harmed. Many tech companies easily pass that test because they offer handy, free or inexpensive products. But critics of existing laws say that the big companies may be hurting competition in other ways, by preventing start-ups from succeeding or innovating, that are more difficult to measure.Advertisement"}

In some ways, the 20 percent era is harder to imagine than the fully automated era, because this supposedly unstoppable and frictionless technology will still be embroiled in a total mess. The best, safest models will most likely come with the highest price tags, out of reach for those with average incomes. Coexistence between human and robot drivers will be uneasy at best; road rage against the machine will boil over. One catastrophic accident could still imperil the whole experiment, no matter what the overall statistics show.But that inevitable mess is precisely what makes the one-in-five future so interesting to ponder. It\u2019s the first point, give or take, when it will be clear that a true self-driving future is even possible. When car companies will actually be able to rip out the steering wheels from some models, designing them in entirely different ways. When big trucking firms and car services like Uber will have begun to remove drivers from their vehicles. When hypercommuters will trust their cars to drive them three hours to the office while they sleep. When you might risk putting your child in one, alone.The autonomous vehicle went from test-track prototype to showroom reality far faster than I envisioned, propelled as much by advances in sensors and A.I. as by a collective hype cycle that seemed intent on willing these devices into existence, whether society was ready for them or not.

It represented a primordial entry point to adulthood, a vast expansion of social possibility.As a rite, the driver\u2019s exam \u2014 I have failed it in two countries \u2014 is a ritual by turns (three-point, of course!) tedious and terrifying. If you can summon nothing else of the 1988 teen comedy \u201cLicense to Drive,\u201d you can still see James Avery\u2019s gleefully malevolent D.M.V. examiner, wielding his famous coffee cup. Once autonomous technology begins to really take off, will the driver\u2019s license, and the pedagogy behind it, go the way of the stick shift? Will the ability to drive begin to seem some exotic, rarely necessary skill \u2014 like starting a fire with a flint?After all, in a vehicle that meets the Level 5 automation criteria of SAE International \u2014 \u201cfull-time performance by an Automated Driving System for all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions\u201d \u2014 there would seem to be little point in possessing this vestigial skill. We don\u2019t require people entering elevators, riding in airport trams or letting Roombas loose upon their living rooms to be able to take over operation in case of machine failure; it\u2019s hard to see why our interaction with this automated technology should be any different. Our learning process could be as quick and dirty as it is with other high-tech products: Toss out the instruction manual and watch someone do it on YouTube.But this possibility, driver made passenger, broaches new territory in jurisprudence. With no licenses, what is the legal basis for restricting anyone \u2014 tweens, the elderly \u2014 from being ferried about? Young farm kids\u2019 driving the family truck seems as obsolete as tail fins, but what\u2019s stopping kids from being driven? Could children, often more adept at handling the smartphones of their parents than their owners are, have an advantage on older drivers less accustomed to technology? Yet the same fears that keep parents from letting their children walk to school may prevail over the allure of their autonomous vehicle handling the school run. It seems hard to say whether autonomous vehicles would hasten or delay the passage to adulthood.And as drivers interact with semiautonomous vehicles in the long run-up to Level 5, driver education and licensing, far from becoming obsolete, may become more important, argues John D. Lee, a professor of engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cAutomation has a strong tendency to surprise people with unexpected behavior,\u201d he says. Knowing what your car is doing \u2014 and when to take over \u2014 could be more vital than merely knowing how to drive. That water on the road \u2014 is it a surface puddle, or a veritable lake filling a gigantic pothole? That truck ahead with the dangerously swaying load \u2014 do you speed up to pass it? Is the pedestrian by the marked crosswalk waiting for you to yield or simply checking his iPhone? \u201cDriving and managing the automation that is helping you drive,\u201d Lee says, \u201care two quite different skill sets. Automation-management skills need to be learned as much as driving skills.\u201dTom Vanderbilt is the author of \u201cYou May Also Like\u201d and \u201cTraffic.\u201dDriverless cars will sometimes need to move around the city with no humans in them at all \u2014 en route to pickups or drop-offs. As empty moving vehicles become a common sight, they\u2019re sure to enable an annoying off-label use: a flowering youth subculture of external joy riding, similar to subway surfing.All over the country, bored teenagers will lurk on the roadside, waiting to leap onto the roofs of empty cars, hanging on for as long as they can. The surfers will take advantage of advances in cloaking technology to help them confuse the cars\u2019 sensors. Some will develop a clever assortment of grips and attachments to help them stay on, although the best among them will sneer at those who need to use tools. Fatalities will be inevitable, and often gruesome.To keep the kids off, car owners will try to coat their cars in slick repellents; these will be effective but too messy to be practical. Soon, dealers of autonomous cars will offer optional rows of spikes similar to those we already use to keep homeless people off benches. Once again, design will become more hostile in the name of safety.Rollo Romig is a journalist based in New York.Liberated from having to watch the road, commuters\u2019 eyes will be free to \u2014 what else? \u2014 consume video content. Sound\u2019s hold on drive time \u2014 first with terrestrial radio, then satellite radio, then podcasts \u2014 will gave way to sight. But what kind of videos will we watch? If Marchetti\u2019s constant holds (this is the idea that as transportation technology and urban planning change, people contort their lives to keep their commutes to an average of one hour per day), they will be not feature films but TV shows and short videos of the kind being increasingly produced for Facebook and YouTube. Podcasts will be displaced by vodcasts. Media companies are already negotiating with carmakers about how to price their offerings. Should in-car entertainment work more like cable or like the on-demand system in a hotel? Like Netflix or like Roku?Most riders who play games will use their phones. But by the time one in five cars is autonomous, console makers will develop specific products for it. The nearly two hours a day of console gaming played by some 60 million Americans will tick up accordingly. Swarms of commuters hitting the morning and evening roads in waves will become swarms of druids or mercenaries in massively multiplayer online games, some of which might come to incorporate the driving experience itself, a Pok\u00e9mon Go for the highway.It seems less likely that we\u2019ll use this opportunity to steal time back from screens. But if there\u2019s enough space for a table, maybe commuters will sit around it playing poker or telling stories. Cars are, indeed, the most private places we have, sealed shut, out of earshot. (The writer Nicholson Baker has said that he likes to write while in a car parked in a shady spot.)Chris Anderson \u2014 formerly the editor of Wired, now the head of a drone-data company and, in his spare time, of a racing league for autonomous cars \u2014 says the question of what we\u2019ll do inside self-driving cars always comes up at cocktail parties. It always confounds him. \u201cWe have this world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s called the back seat of an Uber.\u201d We already know what passengers do in back seats, be they in a limo or an R.V. or a tour bus: They pull out their phones or their iPads, or they talk to one another, or they take a nap. Why should we think that not having a driver will change anything?In an essay for Real Life magazine titled \u201cPerpetual Motion Machines,\u201d Chenoe Hart argues that we miss something when we think of autonomous cars this way, as a difference in degree, not in kind. Because we won\u2019t have to worry about driving, vehicle interiors can expand to a point where we\u2019 stop thinking of them as vehicles: They might have fully functional kitchens, or gyms, or beds. Instead of going to the coffee shop, the coffee shop might come to you; instead of going into the garage to pull out your car, the garage will be the car. The ability to summon spaces like this, Hart writes, will turn the built environment into a kind of random-access memory \u2014 with every destination equally accessible from anywhere. Whether it drove to you or you to it will be irrelevant; motion will be so smooth and constant as to be imperceptible. Hart argues that when travel becomes fully autonomous, we will always be traveling: families or co-workers in quiet concert on giant roads, moving in a cluster of moving buildings, chasing good weather, hardly aware that we\u2019re going anywhere at all.James Somers is a writer and programmer based in New York.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise.A harness could allow squats on a balance ball.Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips.This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors.It\u2019s not as straightforward as it sounds. For one thing, the vehicles would not be freed from the laws of physics. Should your car abruptly brake while you were, for example, running on a treadmill, the treadmill would cease moving forward \u2014 but you wouldn\u2019t, at least until you hit a windshield or door.It might be easier to remain seated. \u201cThe car could have special pockets all over the place that hold resistance bands of different strengths,\u201d says Bryant Johnson, a personal trainer and the author of \u201cThe Ruth Bader Ginsburg Workout.\u201d \u201cYou could use those to get a full-body strength-training workout.\u201dThroughout your commute, your future car could scrutinize your efforts, says Steve McCauley, the head of health services for the Wynn Las Vegas resort, with fingertip monitors or other sensors tracking your heart rate and the composition of your sweat.But realistically, many of us will use our salvaged commuting time otherwise. In tomorrow\u2019s cars, the area beneath the hood may not be needed for a combustion engine, Vujicic says \u2014 but it will remain, for reasons of mechanical stability and safety. Fitted with some padding and a safety belt, it becomes a napping cave.If self-driving cars start to make up a significant portion of urban traffic, they\u2019re likely to push cities to become more populous and compact, with fewer owned vehicles and more car sharing. The future, that is, would look more like Singapore, one of the world\u2019s densest cities, whose government in recent years has tried to curb car ownership and ease congestion problems. We reached out to Limin Hee, the director of research at Singapore\u2019s Center for Livable Cities, to ask her about how she thinks autonomous cars will begin to change urban life.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.These exploits, though dramatic, took advantage of the same vulnerabilities in cellular networks that might plague any tablet or smart vacuum cleaner. But a future in which one in five vehicles is autonomous will not only increase the attack \u201csurface\u201d (in the metaphor favored by researchers) of the car; it will also force manufacturers to confront more insidious security risks that are only now coming into view. It will become possible to compromise vehicles by hacking the environment.A car that drives itself uses sensors to construct high-resolution images of its surroundings, then runs them through a \u201cclassifier\u201d to identify all the objects in the image. The classifier can do this because it has trained on labeled images; after seeing a hundred thousand trucks, it learns to recognize certain features as indicating truck-ness. Today\u2019s most popular and effective classifiers for object recognition, used widely in self-driving car software, are called deep neural networks.But a deep neural network offers researchers very little understanding of why objects become classified as they do. Think of its output as a map, with each classification corresponding, like a ZIP code, to some demarcated region. Instead of existing in just two dimensions, though, the map has more like a thousand dimensions \u2014 and the slightest move in any one of these dimensions can push us into a different ZIP code and produce a false classification. This makes it possible for a hacker to construct slightly perturbed images, called \u201cadversarial examples,\u201d that look innocuous to the human eye but fool the car\u2019s brain into making the wrong call, with potentially fatal consequences.Adversarial examples are extremely difficult to defend against. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand these attacks,\u201d says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut the deeper question is that we don\u2019t understand deep neural networks.\u201d In a recent paper, Song and her co-authors introduced a method of constructing robust adversarial examples that can even be printed on paper and pasted to road signs. A stop sign defaced with specially calibrated graffiti, for instance, is recognized as a 45 m.p.h. speed-limit sign.Song\u2019s warning extends beyond road infrastructure. While researchers for decades have been working on \u2014 and developing countermeasures for \u2014 software vulnerabilities, the study of security issues related to deep learning is still in its infancy. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a precise mathematical definition of a pedestrian,\u201d Song says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for us to write down a formula describing exactly what a pedestrian is. So we can\u2019t even really define our security goals.\u201d Even with a recent surge of interest in adversarial examples, researchers are still struggling to understand the scope of the problem. Given the physical-world ramifications, Song says, \u201cwe should have started even sooner.\u201dYiren Lu is a writer and software engineer in New York.The trickiest part of the transition to a self-driving future may be figuring out liability when accidents do happen. Instead of quarreling only about which driver was at fault, we will also be able to argue about whether the self-driving features in either car may have played a role. A preview of these complications was evident in the aftermath of the crash that killed Joshua Brown, the Ohio man whose autopiloted Tesla ran into a tractor-trailer. Federal investigators determined that the accident was not caused by a defect in the autopilot software, and Tesla has said repeatedly that drivers should always have their hands on the wheel even when they are using the technology. But officials noted that Tesla\u2019s technology was unable to detect cross-traffic like that presented by the tractor-trailer. Tesla subsequently updated its software to make similar accidents less likely in the future.So who was responsible for covering the damages? The insurance policy that covered Brown, who may not have fully understood the capabilities of his car, or Tesla? Neither Tesla nor Brown\u2019s family has commented on who paid. And both car insurers and insurance regulators have been relatively slow to contend with the difficulty in assigning liability when a person is driving a car only part of the time. \u201cInsurance policies have not necessarily caught up with the global advancement of A.I. technology in cars,\u201d Brown\u2019s lawyer told me.Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley, which is racing to raise the curtain on the era of autonomous vehicles, is also thinking about insurance. A start-up called Driav intends to bring down insurance rates by monitoring the reams of data coming out of self-driving cars in order to figure out, on a second-to-second basis, who or what caused the errors that led to a crash. \u201cIt\u2019s silly that claims are a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 argument,\u201d Dan Peate, Driav\u2019s chief executive, told me. \u201cThe data can just tell us what happened.\u201d The company hopes to begin offering insurance policies next year, with the expectation that they will be cheaper in part because the cars will be in fewer accidents and in part because it plans to be able to shift some liability onto the carmakers.In the long run, when all vehicles are driving themselves, the manufacturers themselves are very likely to assume all of the blame for accidents. Most such companies have said that they plan to pay for anything that happens while their cars and software are in charge. When that\u2019s the case, insurance begins to look a lot more like a product warranty, covered by the carmaker, than a stand-alone product that a customer has to worry about. But in the transition years until then, there are likely to be a lot more messy arguments.Nathaniel Popper is a technology reporter for The Times.When I think about the future these days, I inevitably return to a tweet from the writer Elizabeth Hamilton-Argyropoulos (a.k.a. @bourgeoisalien): \u201cThe saddest part about self-driving cars will be all the times people die mid-trip and then ur dinner guests or pizza guy will arrive dead.\u201d To read this joke is to become immediately certain that this will absolutely happen \u2014 of course it will! \u2014 and that it will furthermore become as much a part of the texture of everyday future life as, say, traffic delays caused by collisions are now. Admittedly, the dead-pizza-guy notion doesn\u2019t seem very likely: A large part of the impetus behind the development of self-driving technology in the first place is the desire to do away with the need for flesh-and-blood people who demand wages for their work. But the image feels symbolically resonant precisely because of the ghostly future of all those moribund jobs. Self-driving cars bearing the earthly remains of the recently deceased \u2014 automated Ubers, say, with heart-attack victims sprawled incredulously across the rear seat \u2014 are, in this sense, an extreme metaphor for the near future of capitalism. The technology will be miraculous, yes; but if it functions as intended, it will serve as an uncanny vector of human obsolescence.Mark O\u2019Connell is a writer based in Dublin.\u201cRide-sharing\u201d was always a misnomer for companies like Uber and Lyft. As with the rest of the \u201csharing economy,\u201d nothing was ever being shared; labor and services were being bought and sold. But as ride-share companies have grown, their ambitions have multiplied and compounded. Currently, their horizons are limited by widespread car ownership, alternative transit options and, primarily, their own cost. But autonomous cars make their grander plans \u2014 dreams of vast fleets of perfectly allocated and used vehicles \u2014 more plausible. They zero out a single variable, the cost of labor, that these companies believe is holding them back from utterly reshaping the world. Ride-share businesses are uniquely poised to manifest and demonstrate the big ideas of self-driving cars. They aren\u2019t waiting for this change; they\u2019re doing everything in their power to hasten it. Autonomous cars aren\u2019t just part of the plan; they are the plan.Conservative estimates put the world\u2019s Ubers and Lyfts in an enviable position as self-driving cars roll out. Bullish projections put them in an unassailable one. A 2017 report by Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest, told the story in four numbers. A rider\u2019s \u201call-in cost per mile\u201d for average United States taxi services was about $3.50. For a human-driven Uber in San Francisco, that number was about $2.86. Assuming the same fuel price, the figure for personal cars is much lower, at around 70 cents. The estimate for self-driving taxi services, circa 2020, would cut that cost in half.At 35 cents per mile, tasks that were previously too expensive or that would have felt ridiculous become reasonable and routine. A world in which moving yourself or moving things to you costs almost nothing in terms of money or attention would remake places and transform lives. It would also bring with it new and complicated absurdities \u2014 the sort Americans adapt to quickly and then forget. (Like bottles of water shipped around the world and sold for $2, or electronics products assembled in one country from parts from six others, to be shipped to a seventh.)Riders will thrill to this new infrastructure as it incorporates the roads around them, providing novel experiences and conveniences. But this excitement will prevent us from seeing that our aspiring fleet managers hope to create something like the profound consolidation of the internet\u2019s recent past. Just as Amazon the online store laid the groundwork for Amazon the comprehensive and omnipresent service, apps for human-driven taxis may have laid the groundwork for a thrumming on-demand grid, on which people and things can be placed and retrieved.Like Google and Facebook before them, which remapped, rerouted and dominated the old and diverse web infrastructure on which they were built, Uber and Lyft could say, credibly, that they work better with size and full participation. That market domination is merely the flip side of completeness. They will aspire to monopoly and could achieve, with startling speed, real and unprecedented claims over the roads we share \u2014 they will say they\u2019ve found a better use for them, and if all goes to plan, riders will agree.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The Times.Unless you\u2019re a millionaire or a truck driver, your first encounter with a self-driving vehicle will probably be a car you ordered through a ride-hailing app like Lyft or Uber. These companies, which spent the first stage of their lives trying to get drivers into their cars, are spending the next one trying to get them out. There will be some initial awkwardness around self-driving vehicles, just as there was around ride-hailing in the first place. (Remember when it was weird to get into a stranger\u2019s unmarked car?)But Lyft, for one, is betting that it can put a trustable face on the tech. In July, it announced Level 5, a lab where it will work on its own driverless software, in addition to developing an open self-driving network that companies like Ford and Jaguar Land Rover will be able to plug their vehicles into. The idea of the network is to combine multiple kinds of autonomous vehicles under one routing-and-request system, so that when you order a Lyft, the app will assess your route, check the weather and other factors and send you the best ride, whether that\u2019s an autonomous Waymo or a human-driven S.U.V. John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s co-founder and president, explained its thinking.Kevin Roose is a business columnist for The Times and a writer at large for the magazine.For reasons that have gone unstudied, humans become horny in transit. With the proliferation of subway systems came the proliferation of subway gropers. With commercial air travel came the \u201cMile High Club.\u201d Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee filmed their famous sex tape on a boat (I\u2019m told). There\u2019s something about transportation that gets people in the mood. What is it?My theory is simple. In our capacity as humans, we have three speeds at which we operate: crawl, walk and run. In other words: extremely slow, slow and slightly less slow. When we engage with equipment that increases our velocity, we become excited. This excitement applies in all cases, whether we\u2019re talking about an escalator, a moving walkway, a bicycle, a roller coaster, a golf cart or a Chrysler LeBaron. It is fundamentally thrilling to travel at an unexpected speed. When the enabling mode of transportation is one that permits our excitement to be processed as erotic energy \u2014 even if that processing is specifically legislated against \u2014 some of us will do that. The distance between \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cstimulated\u201d is, after all, incredibly short. If there were a way to have sex on a bicycle, people would be bike-sexing all the time. It would have its own verb.Having sex in a car is not currently impossible, but it is difficult. Hand-eye coordination, a mechanism critical for sex-having, is compromised for the driver, whose hands must remain on the wheel and eyes on the road. In road couplings, the driver is not an equal contributor. Unless, of course, the driver doesn\u2019t need to drive at all. Which brings us to the self-driving car: basically a motel room on wheels. The one hindrance to this development is existing public-lewdness laws, which are fairly expansive. You can\u2019t intentionally get naked and perform a \u201clewd act\u201d in a public place without risk of penalty. Obviously. But you also run a risk if you perform your lewd act in a private place with the intention of being watched \u2014 say, in a self-driven automobile slowly cruising past a school bus where my future grandchildren are watching in horror as a frenzied orgy unfolds within smelling distance. I am confident, however, that the law will be updated to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable car-based encounters.And if not, industrial designers can come up with clever \u201csolves,\u201d the word that start-ups use for some reason instead of \u201csolutions.\u201d If car windows no longer need to function as navigating aids, why not tint them to inky obscurity? Or replace them with mirrors facing outward? Or mirrors facing inward? Or remove them entirely? Future riders may not even need a human partner in order to have an intimate appointment. Nissan is working with Microsoft to develop an \u201cin-vehicle virtual personal assistant\u201d which, if deviously hacked, could provide the 21st-century equivalent of phone sex.More interesting than the aesthetics of car sex will be the cultural consequences. New slang terms will arise. New positions. New trophies. (How many times can you have sex in the time it takes to drive from Las Vegas to Los Angeles?) Virginities will be lost, children conceived, marriage vows consummated and violated. Car-based kinks will be minted and postcoital rituals established. New professional opportunities will emerge: interior decorators who specialize in \u201cself-driving bedrooms\u201d; entrepreneurs who launch apps to enable no-strings-attached in-car assignations. Preferences will be identified and explored. The world will expand in narrow but pulse-quickening ways \u2014 not a sexual revolution, but a plot twist.Molly Young is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

The episodes, they said, occurred in the late 1990s.Mr. Oreskes could not immediately be reached for comment.In a statement, a spokeswoman for The Times, Eileen Murphy, said: \u201cThe Times takes all allegations of sexual harassment seriously and we are looking into it.\u201dMr. Oreskes is the latest powerful media leader to face accusations of sexual harassment.

Before starting at NPR, Mr. Oreskes had worked at The Associated Press and The Times. At The Times, which he joined in 1981, he was a top editor and a chief political correspondent. He also served as the executive editor at The International Herald Tribune.In a statement, a spokeswoman for The A.P., Lauren Easton, said the organization \u201ctakes any kind of harassment allegation very seriously.\u201d\u201cIf a report is made,\u201d she continued, \u201cit is promptly investigated and appropriate action is taken.\u201dThe women who spoke to The Washington Post said separately that Mr. Oreskes had offered them career advice and then made unwelcome sexual advances toward them.

But the Justice Department may not let a big media marriage happen. That is one of the many debated questions. Proponents of the Republicans\u2019 plans argue that companies will invest the money. Opponents counter that firms will return the cash to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends.\u201cWhen all variables are measured properly, it seems major companies are paying out to shareholders about 22 percent of their net income. It\u2019s therefore unlikely that new profit, as might follow from lower corporate tax rates, will simply be drained out of the corporation.\u201cMore generally, sending money back to investors doesn\u2019t have to mean no new investment. What if those investors take the money and put it in a venture capital fund or invest it in some other manner? The whole point of capital markets is to recycle resources into the most profitable new opportunities, and that may or may not involve the companies that initially earned those profits.\u201dWith 95 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported third-quarter results, earnings are on pace to grow 6.2 percent from a year earlier, according to FactSet. That\u2019s up from the 3.1 percent growth rate expected at the end of period.Technology companies drove much of the growth. The sector reported a 19.7 percent increase in earnings and was the biggest contributor to earnings growth rate. If the tech sector was excluded, the overall growth rate would fall to 2.8 percent from 6.2 percent.Here are some more takeaways from earnings season:\u2022 Profits at companies that generate more that 50 percent of their sales outside the United States, grew more than 13 percent in the third quarter. Earnings at firms that get a majority of their revenue from within the U.S., rose only 2.3 percent.That is a reversal of what many analysts expected at the beginning of 2017. A stronger American dollar, a pickup in the United State\u2019s economy, and the Trump administration\u2019s policies were expected to benefit companies with the greatest exposure to United States were expected to benefit more from the Trump administration\u2019s policies, and a stronger dollar. But the United States dollar remained weaker.\u2022 The energy sector reported the largest increase in earnings of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors at 135 percent. The increase is a reflection of how hard the roughly two year slide in oil prices had hit the industry.\u2022 74 percent of companies have reported profits above analysts expectations, above the five-year average of 69 percent.\u2022 Financial firms reported the biggest decline in profits, down 8.3 percent. That decline can largely be blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

{"Headline": "Full Tilt: When 100% of Cars Are Autonomous", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "Urban-transportation experts have been busily creating computer simulations to show how this might work. In one model, each crossroads would have an \u201cintersection manager,\u201d a computer that senses the approaching traffic and uses wireless communication to talk to the oncoming cars. When each self-driving car is perhaps 300 yards away, it sends a request to the intersection manager \u2014 to turn right, say, or to move on through. The intersection manager then does an on-the-fly calculation to route that vehicle most efficiently, like an omnipotent and tireless traffic cop.The result? A ballet of cars whizzing and weaving past one another in the intersection. Some slow down as they approach; others pass straight through. But crucially, compared with today\u2019s intersections, many fewer cars come to a complete halt.This could significantly speed up traffic throughout an entire city. Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who works with one model, has found that the \u201cdelay\u201d time at intersections shrinks remarkably. \u201cRight now, it takes me an average of 20 minutes to get to work, but with autonomous-car intersections, it might be half that time,\u201d he says. Safety would be enhanced, too: Forty-three percent of car crashes in the United States occur at intersections, and Stone predicts that robot vehicles would crash only if there was a mechanical error. Better yet, autonomous intersections could produce an estimated 20 to 50 percent less carbon dioxide, because there would be fewer idling cars and jack-rabbit starts. \u201cThat\u2019s the most expensive and most polluting part of driving,\u201d says Remi Tachet des Combes, a mathematician who created robot-intersection models while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.For the human passenger, though, a robotized intersection could be mildly terrifying \u2014 like flying through a crowded asteroid belt, trusting the A.I. to find the right path. \u201cAt first I think it will be freaky,\u201d Stone admits. \u201cSome people will need the window darkened so they don\u2019t freak out.\u201d But in the long run, we\u2019ll probably shrug, get used to it and barely look up from our games of Candy Crush as we zip through. And pedestrians? They would probably push a button at the intersection to request their turn \u2014 or even use a smartphone app.More subtly unsettling, however, might be the spectacle of a city devoid of stoplights. Indeed, devoid of all major street signs: no huge billboards across highways naming the exits, no complex merge instructions. Those signs are expensive to build and maintain. They\u2019re designed for humans, and GPS-brained robots don\u2019t need them to know where they\u2019re going. Certainly, human pedestrians and cyclists will still need guideposts, but as Stone suspects, far fewer, and smaller, ones.A world with almost no street signs would feel strange. It could make a city less cluttered and more attractive. But it might also leave us feeling unmoored. Social critics worry that GPS has already eroded our knowledge of the city; some studies have found that the more we rely on devices, the less we deeply intuit where we are and how to navigate on our own. \u201cWe become more helpless,\u201d as Greg Milner, the author of \u201cPinpoint,\u201d a history of GPS, told me. If robots rule the roads, we might get where we\u2019re going a lot more quickly \u2014 but end up not knowing precisely where we are.Clive Thompson is the author of \u201cSmarter Than You Think: How Technology Is Changing Our Minds for the Better.\u201dDeveloped by Marshall Brown, Lili Du, Laura Forlano, Jack Guthman, and Ron Henderson. Visual Design by Maryam HeidaripourBrown is a creator of the Driverless City Project, an interdisciplinary research initiative at I.I.T. that takes a playful, rigorous approach to envisioning the fully autonomous future. The project helps participants generate various situations for a city in order to determine how autonomous cars will fit into the picture. Central to the project is a \u201cmind map\u201d representing the group\u2019s research, organized into four areas of impact: street space, parking space, commuter space and delivery space. The map, as well as other tools \u2014 including a set of large tokens for scenario building, like a tarot deck for urbanists \u2014 is meant to encourage others to be ambitious and creative about the world in which they want to live. \u201cWe should write the future,\u201d Brown says, \u201crather than trying to predict it.\u201dBrown has found two prevalent attitudes when it comes to self-driving vehicles: either an active but unimaginative approach, rushing to build robots to accommodate the world as it is now, or a totally passive approach, a sort of \u201cwait and see.\u201d The first, he says, is characteristic of the tech industry; the second, of the public sector. \u201cI hear too much surrendering in the question about our future right now,\u201d he adds. \u201cJust surrendering to Google or Amazon, or surrendering to your phone, or surrendering to a driverless car. We should not surrender.\u201dOne way to stave off surrender, Brown believes, is to invite more diverse thinkers, like architects and urban planners, into the process of imagining and designing the autonomous future. (He also listed sociologists, fiction writers, Buddhist monks, poets and rabbis as useful stakeholders.) The current discourse around the future of autonomous vehicles is centered on \u201ctechnologically deterministic fantasies,\u201d Brown says. He\u2019s concerned that technological values \u2014 like logic, predictability and efficiency \u2014 will be erroneously imposed upon the built environment, leading to urban spaces that fail to take into account delight, pleasure or human connection. \u201cA society is cultural, and political, and aesthetic, and about desires \u2014 it\u2019s not just how you solve problems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to need more than just software engineers working on it.\u201dAs an architect, Brown is especially attuned to the unlocked aesthetic potential of urban environments. Today\u2019s visual clutter, necessary for keeping human-driven cars as nonlethal as possible, could be eradicated. It is critical, in his view, to consider the beauty and quality of the world that self-driving cars could bring.It\u2019s worth considering, then, where cars will go when people don\u2019t need them. \u201cWhat happens when a car can park itself anywhere?\u201d Brown asks. He hypothesizes that parking, if performed robotically, could become \u201ca negative externality, not unlike that of a trash dump,\u201d should developers repurpose garages and parking lots for more lucrative uses. (Why look for parking in Greenwich Village if the car can park itself on the edge of New Jersey?) In the Midwest, he speculates, deindustrialized cities with waning property values could even be bought wholesale and transformed into vast, flat parking lots \u2014 a future that he deemed plausible, if \u201ctoo dystopian,\u201d in no small part because of the likelihood that it would be pushed upon lower-income communities. On the other hand, those same communities could benefit from increased mobility and access to employment.Brown is also considering the changes to storage: If robotic trucks constantly roam our landscape, will warehouses be abandoned? He\u2019s focused on the changing needs and desires of a human driver. To accommodate an autonomous, cross-country route, truck cabs, he speculates, may need to expand according to a driver\u2019s needs, perhaps going so far as to resemble a microapartment.An emphasis (or lack thereof) on efficiency also addresses the temporal dimension of cities: It favors \u2014 or facilitates \u2014 a working lifestyle in which there is never enough time. In a future of increased automation and accessibility, work culture may begin to shift; labor, and its attendant time constraints, may no longer be central to the urban experience. Brown envisions the possibility of a hands-free commute that opens up space for socializing \u2014 \u201can interior social world.\u201d Riders could chat with people in adjacent cars or simply take the opportunity to watch the world go by. (A more cynical take on this, he says, is that the hands-free commute will simply increase the demands on workers, as the car becomes an extension of the home office \u2014 a WeWork on wheels.)Second-order effects of autonomous vehicles tend to get lost in the techno-utopian chatter, but there seems to be an increasing awareness that self-driving cars won\u2019t just arrive in cities; they\u2019ll change them too. Some tech companies are beginning to get into data-driven city-building, a movement largely galvanized by the seeming inevitability of autonomous vehicles. Last year, Y Combinator announced a research initiative, New Cities, that aimed to study how to build a metropolis entirely from scratch. In mid-October, Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet subsidiary, announced that it will redevelop a 12-acre strip along Toronto\u2019s waterfront, called Quayside, which will integrate technology across the human experience. The vehicles it is planning to accommodate will be shared, electric and self-driving.Power and control over autonomous-vehicle technology is already concentrated in the hands of a small few: If a company like Uber or Alphabet controls the dominant transportation infrastructure, you need not live in an intentional community like Quayside to feel as though your city is becoming a company town. Brown is wary of the smart-cities initiative, and he resents the efforts of technology companies to fully saturate the human \u2014 and urban \u2014 experience. \u201cA city is not a problem to be solved,\u201d he says. \u201cA city is a cultural construct, even though it involves the deployment of technologies. A city is not science alone.\u201dAnna Wiener is a writer based in San Francisco.Tomorrow\u2019s could. Unlike Google Glass \u2014 which awkwardly placed screens where they didn\u2019t need to be \u2014 a car already requires a membrane between passengers and their environment. Why not turn that typically passive barrier into a dynamic canvas? Ordinary windows could be replaced with holographic glass or an advanced semitranslucent liquid-crystal display. They could anticipate our needs and instantaneously display weather forecasts, reviews of nearby restaurants and hotels, details about popular tourist attractions \u2014 and warnings about miserable tourist traps.As the technology improves and people become more comfortable obscuring their surroundings, your windows could begin to overlay a vast digital diorama onto passing scenery. Passengers would no longer have to wonder about the identity of a landmark and scramble to look it up on their phones. Instead, the car itself, wired with artificial intelligence, plugged into sophisticated mapping technology and equipped with magic eyes, would instantaneously recognize, annotate and augment its surroundings. A mountain, desert or coastline could become an interactive infographic, peeling away the physical surface of the earth to reveal hidden layers of geology. A self-directed double-decker bus ambling through London could rearrange the city like a Lego set, refashioning streets and buildings to illuminate the capital\u2019s rich history. Early television sets made the distant accessible; the self-driving car could reveal the invisible in the immediate.As exciting as such possibilities are, recent history suggests plenty of reasons to temper our optimism. When windows double as screens, we will have the opportunity to gaze at the world anew through richly animated portals. Alternatively \u2014 and perhaps more realistically \u2014 we could end up staring into larger versions of our phones, distracting ourselves with email, mindless games and the infinite bazaar of the internet. The potential of the autonomous vehicle is to help us interact with our environment in ways never before possible. The temptation is to turn ever more inward, exchanging the physical world for yet another simulation.Either way, self-driving cars with ubiquitous screens will inevitably bring all the familiar drawbacks of digital media onto the open road. Taxi TV in New York City is just a preview of the potential nightmare. What if the price for enchanted windows of the future is a nauseating kaleidoscope of advertisements, vapid movie reviews and contextless late-night jokes? Rather than learning about the hidden history of your surroundings, you may very well learn only about two-for-one cricket tacos in the food truck a lane over, homeowner\u2019s insurance for the Anthropocene or the sale on microdrones at a nearby mall. Don\u2019t want ads? No problem. You can upgrade to a premium account.Ferris Jabr is a writer based in Portland, Ore.One big question about the driverless car will be who gets to own our new wealth of free time. Will it remain with commuters \u2014 or will corporations expect them to tap into the office as their vehicles ferry them there? While the potential for hours of unplugged leisure exists, the way we currently fill our downtime leads me to believe that some form of digital immersion will take precedence, as bosses expect employees to work on their way to and from work. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the remaining minimum-wage positions in the rapidly automating food industry go to those who have access to driverless cars; use their cars for deliveries while they work, and you get two employees for the price of one.It\u2019s tricky. On their surface, driverless cars will take some of the mess out of living, but they can also take the living where they don\u2019t want to go, both psychologically and physically. Some car interiors might more closely resemble cubicles. Or cells. Will private employers surveil workers in order to control off-duty behavior? It\u2019s also easy to conceive of a future where newly created infrastructure, explicitly dedicated to automated vehicles, will enable people with the means to own the cars to avoid the people without.We should be wary of any technology that allows those with power to distance themselves even further from society.Rahawa Haile is an Eritrean-American writer of short stories and essays.Autonomous cars will once again transform teenage life. Anab Jain, a founder of the design studio Superflux, says the ritual requirements of teenage socializing will inspire \u201ca new range of acts and services that help you obfuscate your car\u2019s identity or your own data.\u201d Instead of trying to roll back the odometer on the family car \u00e0 la Ferris Bueller, teenagers hoping to roam the city, free from parental view, might trick it into recording destinations they didn\u2019t really visit. \u201cThe whole notion of freedom will change,\u201d Jain says, even as some of the destinations remain familiar. Dark streets or quiet state parks where GPS doesn\u2019t reach would be the coolest sites of all.The question of when, exactly, the party has started will also become an intriguing one: After all, each car is a room unto itself. The Situationist International, a loose group of artists, political agitators and heavy drinkers who roamed the streets of Paris and other cities in the 1960s, treating them as arenas for detours and debauchery, offers some clues about how such rooms could be transformed. \u201cI only ever hear self-driving cars talked about as a functional solution to the problem of getting from A to B,\u201d says McKenzie Wark, the author of a history of the Situationists called \u201cThe Beach Beneath the Street.\u201d (The title is a reference to the sand that was revealed when protesters picked up cobblestones from the Paris streets to throw at the police.) Wark imagines these machines rolling out of the factory with more radical settings hard-wired into their operating systems. \u201cA hybrid of the self-driving car and, say, Grindr could bring a whole new meaning to the concept of cruising,\u201d Wark suggests. \u201cThere should be a \u2018scenic route\u2019 setting, a \u2018random\u2019 setting, a \u2018surprise me\u2019 setting. Or maybe \u2018mystery destination,\u2019 which whisks you \u2014 and algorithmically chosen others \u2014 to an undisclosed location. Algorithmic chicken for teenage drivers, where you drive head-on toward another car \u2014 then magically swerve off at the last minute.\u201dUnlike today\u2019s cars, autonomous cars can also be made to swarm together, creating somewhat of a paradox: a moving traffic jam. Once the swarm is formed, proximity algorithms could mine social-media profiles to arrange like-minded clusters, while enabling \u201cshuffle mode\u201d might one day be the equivalent of texting a friend to rescue you from the boring guy in the corner. Aspiring D.J.s will rely on software to assemble self-driving cars into the ideal configuration for louder bass. Couples armed with GPS jammers \u2014 the future\u2019s perfect Valentine\u2019s Day gift \u2014 will quietly steer strangers away, creating a halo of romantic privacy around their makeout sessions. If all else fails, hit \u201cskip\u201d to be transported to an entirely new party.Hidden beneath the hormone haze of future block parties, new opportunities for cultural pranks and political protest will emerge. Rather than throw cobblestones, protesters could quickly jam the streets to show political solidarity or organize a strike. With the right programming skills, they might be able to shut down a whole city just by blocking a few crucial nodes. They could even open the streets back up to foot traffic, remaking them as a space for celebration. Then, of course, when it\u2019s time to go home, all those dull factory presets, optimized for safety and efficiency, will finally come into their own \u2014 no designated driver necessary.Geoff Manaugh is the author of \u201cA Burglar\u2019s Guide to the City.\u201dIn the self-driving future, a weed transaction will begin the same as always \u2014 by texting your dealer in search of \u201ctree,\u201d or by casually asking if he wants to \u201chang out.\u201d En route to another customer\u2019s house, he will text back immediately, freed from the imposition of two hands on the wheel. Memories of waiting impatiently on a flaky dealer will recede as his car appears on your app, predicting arrival time down to the minute. Watch as his vehicle weaves around school zones, or is maybe flagged and pulled over by the police. The new possibilities for surveillance are endless.In any case, if he makes it to your house, it is likely that he will emerge from his self-driving pod in a sweatshirt for a company with a name like T\u014dkTaxi or Gangl.ly or Lyft\u2019d. As weed begins to trend toward legality, we\u2019ve already seen such standing-desk branding start to creep into the stoner vernacular. A scan down PC Magazine\u2019s \u201c15 Blazing Hot Weed Tech Companies to Watch\u201d reveals Tokken (a blockchain system for dealers), MassRoots (a stoner social network) and Eaze (the obligatory \u201cUber for weed\u201d). In this new age of cannabis, the only thing that moves faster than the tech is the rate at which smoking itself becomes corny.But cringe-worthy orthography is not the only thing that this self-driven industry will inherit from Silicon Valley. In the age of semiautonomous cars, dealers will be forced to file 1099s, sharing their profits as lowly subcontractors. As in the time when dealers drove themselves, this fleet of buddies-for-hire will offer five to 10 minutes of humanity-affirming chitchat. Unlike preautonomous dealers, they will plead that you tweet their referral codes in order to receive a complimentary edible.This, of course, is one good reason to strive for fully autonomous drugmobiles. The driverless vehicle eliminates small talk, supplying your fix directly from the glove box with a personalized passcode, \u00e0 la Amazon Locker. With no human body attached to the cargo, suppliers will seek to move harder drugs, in bigger quantities, potentially unleashing a new set of problems. The narc, a liability throughout all of human history, isn\u2019t likely to go anywhere soon. Self-driving cars will scan for hazards in the street but will also pickup telltale signs of an informant: nervous twitches, too-enthusiastic slang. A customer might even be asked to answer a question like, \u201cAre you a cop?\u201d (Because, as all drug dealers know, a real cop has to say yes, even to an A.I.) It is likely that a database of narcs will be compiled, and inevitably, this database of narcs will be hacked. Millions of Americans will be exposed as poseurs \u2014 a social problem tragically immune to disruption.Jamie Lauren Keiles is a writer in New York.In the coming world of ubiquitous self-driving, it will just be you, the open road and the vast apparatus of the nanny state. Cars won\u2019t readily violate traffic laws and may well be legally required to report on their owners. Ignore that burned-out headlight for too long, and the overnight software update may include a virtual boot.Traffic tickets bring in billions of dollars annually, so all those well-behaved cars will have an economic impact. Governments that have historically viewed traffic citations as an extractive industry (Ferguson, Mo., say, or the State of California) will have no choice but to find alternatives. Far more consequential, for both the police and their communities, will be the death of the routine traffic stop. The Supreme Court has ruled that law enforcement may stop any car, whatever its true motive, as long as an infraction is observed. Human drivers can\u2019t get far without breaking the letter of the traffic law, so the pretexts come easy. If officers then spot a dozen laptops stacked on the back seat, they can ask questions. Yet this broad, virtually unchecked power to stop has led to charges of racial profiling. (A recent linguistic analysis of bodycam footage from Oakland, Calif., for example, concluded that officers spoke \u201cwith consistently less respect toward black versus white community members.\u201d) With pretexts largely automated away, these kinds of interactions will be rare. \u201cThe self-driving car,\u201d says Elizabeth Joh, a professor at the U.C. Davis School of Law, \u201cwill come to be seen as a civil rights issue.\u201dThe police will have lost an important investigative tool, but the government will have gained new surveillance possibilities. Cars will sweep up vast amounts of data about their surroundings and their occupants, including 24/7 GPS trails. (An important Fourth Amendment case being heard this fall, Carpenter v. United States, will decide whether the government needs a warrant to gain access to cellphone locational data, setting a precedent that could apply to cars.)Another potential target is the pedestrian. In the first part of the 20th century, manufacturers lobbied to make \u201cjaywalking\u201d a crime, so the new horseless carriages could cruise along urban streets relatively unimpeded. The pedestrians of the future, emboldened by the fact that self-driving cars are sure to stop, could cause havoc. No worries, though: Facial-recognition technology is coming along nicely, and the automotive industry will be, if anything, even more powerful. Look for today\u2019s complaints about speeding tickets to be replaced by stories of \u201cjaywalking traps\u201d and pitiless fines for a second offense.Looking back at the decades when the autonomous car was developed, you may find it hard to believe that its engineers imagined that it would stay landbound. All along, sea levels continued to rise, gradually overwhelming the sea walls that many coastal cities built as protection and flooding the (now absurdly named) ground floor of apartment and office buildings.Rather than simply abandon these buildings, though, many residents chose to stay \u2014 fueling a demand for autonomous aquacars and, as that technology improved, for mobile aquahomes. This became especially true after the successful completion of the SeaOrbiter, a floating laboratory originally designed for oceanography research. Elegant and semisubmersible, the SeaOrbiter acted as a kind of prototype for local offshore living \u2014 and the rise of aerial drone delivery, originally pioneered by Amazon, made the challenge of resupplying straightforward.Unfortunately, hackers quickly figured out how to hijack the aquahomes\u2019 navigation system \u2014 first by disabling it and then with programs that directed vessels to floating \u201cchop shops\u201d run by roving gangs of ship-breakers. Piracy rates dropped only after huge kelp growth, driven by a mix of ocean warming and overfishing, rendered the submerged communities as unnavigable by aquacars as they had been by roadbound ones.The animals most imperiled by cars are top predators like the Florida panther. Vehicles are responsible for 59 percent of all known panther deaths recorded in the state since 1981; just last year, a record-breaking 34 panthers \u2014 about one-fourth of the estimated population \u2014 were killed on the state\u2019s roads. Most panthers are struck at night, when human vision is particularly poor, but long-distance infrared cameras can pick up a warmblooded feline body in the dark, far beyond the range of headlights. Panthers able to cross roads safely could spread out of the cramped confines of Florida\u2019s southern tip, move north into the Okefenokee Swamp and then farther into Georgia on their way to eventually repopulating the Southeast.There is a concept in ecology called the trophic cascade, essentially the ripple effect on other animals when a top species vanishes. Over hundreds of years, humans methodically killed off predators like wolves, pumas and grizzly bears. Now, in many places, human drivers have become, albeit unintentionally, the top predator. Every year in the United States, there are an estimated 1.5 million deer-vehicle crashes. If self-driving cars manage to give deer safe passage, the fast-reproducing species would quickly grow beyond the ability of the vegetation to sustain them. \u201cYou\u2019d get a lot of starvation and mass die-offs,\u201d says Daniel J. Smith, a conservation biologist at the University of Central Florida who has been studying road ecology for nearly three decades. Species like raccoons and Virginia opossums will most likely see population explosions. \u201cThere will be deer in people\u2019s yards, and there will be snipers in towns killing them,\u201d Cramer says.This rewilding will be largely accidental, of course. Engineers will program cars to prioritize human life and property, making it far more likely they will stop for a moose than for a sparrow. Just how deferential they are toward wildlife will depend on human choices and ingenuity. For now, the heterogeneity and unpredictability of nature tends to confound the algorithms. In Australia, hopping kangaroos jumbled a self-driving Volvo\u2019s ability to measure distance. In Boston, autonomous-vehicle sensors identified a flock of sea gulls as a single form rather than a collection of individual birds. Still, even the tiniest creatures could benefit. \u201cThe car could know: \u2018O.K., this is a hot spot for frogs. It\u2019s spring. It\u2019s been raining. All the frogs will be moving across the road to find a mate,\u2019\u2009\u201d Smith says. The vehicles could reroute to avoid flattening amphibians on that critical day.But for that to happen, the people making and buying the cars would need to regard them and the roads not just as a mode of transport but also as part of a vast and intricate ecological web. So far, most humans don\u2019t seem particularly inclined to this kind of systems thinking. It is more likely that a surge in animal populations will be just another unintended consequence of a technological shift \u2014 much like social-media sites becoming platforms for publishing fake news or, for that matter, the internal-combustion engine contributing to the suffocation of the planet that might eventually wipe out humans and animals alike. We tend to get caught, ill prepared, in storms of our own making. If one thing seems certain about the autonomous car, it\u2019s that we will go full speed ahead with it, even if we haven\u2019t entirely thought through the consequences.Malia Wollan is the Tip columnist for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Is Said to Plan Repeal of Net Neutrality Rules", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA rollback of net neutrality regulations would represent a significant victory for broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast and would amount to a strike against consumers. When the rules were passed in 2015, they underlined the importance of high-speed internet to the lives of Americans and the need to more strongly regulate the communications service like a utility, as essential as electricity and the telephone.But under a repeal, companies like AT&T and Comcast may be able to charge people higher fees to access certain websites and online services. The companies may also be able to prioritize their own services while disadvantaging websites run by rivals.In addition, Mr. Pai plans to reverse a decision from the Obama administration that declared broadband be treated like a utility, the people said. That classification had opened the door to many more regulations for broadband providers.The F.C.C. did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the repeal plans.Consumer groups and Democrats denounced the proposed changes.\u201cIt ain\u2019t broke, so why fix it?\u201d Julius Genachowski, a former Democratic chairman of the F.C.C., said in an interview. \u201cThe core rules of no blocking, no discrimination, and transparency have worked to create an ecosystem of innovation and investment that\u2019s the envy of the rest of the world.\u201dNet neutrality has long been a thorny topic that has ignited lobbying battles and heated debate between internet and telecom companies. On one side, broadband companies have argued that the regulations encumbered their business plans. On the other side, tech giants like Google and Amazon said that without such rules, the broadband providers could become gatekeepers of what internet content reached consumers.While some of the largest companies can afford to pay for faster delivery of their online content, start-ups like Etsy and Reddit, which have been fierce defenders of net neutrality, have said smaller companies would be squashed by what they view as tolls just to make sure their sites reach consumers.During the Obama administration, the head of the F.C.C., Tom Wheeler, said net neutrality regulations were necessary to prevent a company like Verizon from slowing down the delivery of a service like Netflix or Sling TV, which competes with Verizon\u2019s video service, Fios.Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal to scrap net neutrality rules is the latest in a deregulation blitz that includes the rollback of media ownership and broadband privacy rules. Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump, opposed the rules when they were created in 2015, saying they would stifle investment by broadband providers.More recently, Mr. Pai has clearly signaled his opposition to net neutrality. He has called the rules an example of government overreach in the fast-growing broadband industry. In April, a few months after he was named F.C.C. chairman, he announced his intention to overhaul the rules, saying the threat of harm to consumers was only theoretical.\u201cThe truth of the matter is that we decided to abandon successful policies solely because of hypothetical harms and hysterical prophecies of doom,\u201d Mr. Pai said in an April speech about the creation of the net neutrality rules.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The iPhone X Is Cool. That Doesn\u2019t Mean You Are Ready for It.", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixThe iPhone X is the best iPhone ever made. Many of you probably aren\u2019t ready for it.Here\u2019s why: Apple\u2019s newest iPhone takes a big leap from past models. It lacks a home button, which makes it less intuitive to use than previous iPhones. The device is also the first iPhone to feature a face scanner for unlocking it. And for many people who have developed 10 years of muscle memory from using iPhones a certain way, these may seem like abrupt changes.So is the iPhone X right for you? I tested the device for two days this week after Apple made it available to The New York Times. This was not an ideal length of time to discover all the pros and cons of the smartphone; in years past, we tested new iPhones for a week or more.Otherwise, there are plenty of cheaper smartphones with excellent features. And the iPhone X isn\u2019t perfect. Losing the home button will make it awkward to use for a while.And although the face scanner for unlocking the device is impressive and creepily accurate, in many situations, it didn\u2019t work as quickly as a fingerprint scanner. It also failed to unlock the phone when I wore a pair of Persol sunglasses.The iPhone X feels ahead of its time, perfect for a target audience of technology enthusiasts and obsessive photographers. Everyone else may want to wait awhile to buy.First, the basics: The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that is larger than the 5.5-inch display on the iPhone 8 Plus and the 4.7-inch screen on the iPhone 8. Yet the iPhone X\u2019s overall body is smaller than that of the iPhone 8 Plus (though a little bit larger than that of the iPhone 8).Apple managed to squeeze a larger screen onto a smaller body by eliminating the iPhone\u2019s bezel, which is the border surrounding the display. The screen takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing the infrared face scanner.In the process of removing the bezel, Apple also eliminated the home button. As a result, controlling the iPhone X mostly involves using touch gestures. When inside an app or unlocking the phone, swiping up from the bottom brings you to the home screen. That\u2019s simple, but other functions are trickier. To open the app switcher, a popular feature, you swipe up from the bottom and hold your finger for a second. Many times, I lifted my thumb too soon before opening this shortcut. (On past iPhones, you would just press the home button twice to open the app switcher.)Apple has included a shortcut on the phone called Reachability, which lowers the top of the screen to make it easier for one-handed users to reach for buttons or apps on the top row with their thumb. To engage it, swipe downward from the bottom of the screen. Yet it often took me multiple attempts to swipe the sweet spot before successfully opening it. It is much easier to use Reachability with other iPhones: you just tap the home button twice.I struggled with the new iPhone controls when I ran into a bug. One morning, the Amazon app was loaded on the screen \u2014 then it froze.I tried swiping up to leave the app, then holding two physical side buttons down to shut down the phone, but to no avail.I fumbled around for at least 10 minutes before I read a guide that revealed that pressing three physical buttons in a sequence would force a restart.These are troubling signs for how less technologically inclined people may respond to the iPhone X. For the last decade, the iPhone has been a computer that anyone can use without reading an instruction manual. With the iPhone X, that is no longer the case.Face ID continues to update this map of your face with more information every time you unlock your smartphone \u2014 whether you are wearing a scarf or a hat or growing facial hair. In addition, Face ID can authorize mobile payments, log in to apps and create animated emojis that mimic your face movements.I put Face ID through dozens of tests and it recognized my face in most situations, including when I wore a beanie, Ray-Ban sunglasses or goggles for my Halloween costume or draped a dog toy over my head. It worked in pitch dark at night and outside on a sunny day.But Face ID worked inconsistently \u2014 or not at all \u2014 when I lay the iPhone X flat on a table or my night stand, wore a gas mask for my Halloween costume, walked around in bright sunlight at a park or wore Persol sunglasses. (According to Apple, these particular sunglasses probably blocked the part of the infrared spectrum used by Face ID.) It also didn\u2019t work when I tried using the face scanner while slurping a bowl of noodles.To be fair, Touch ID sometimes failed to scan my fingerprint on previous iPhones, like when my hands were sweaty, damp or dirty. Over the long term, Face ID is likely to save more time than using Touch ID because Face ID only failed in rare circumstances.Before reviewing the iPhone X, I used an iPhone 8 Plus for two weeks for comparison. Both devices have a similar rear camera system with two lenses. The two cameras work together to show the picture\u2019s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background. Apple calls this Portrait mode, also known as the bokeh effect.The dual-lens camera is extremely compelling, with Portrait mode making photos of even the most mundane things \u2014 like a bowl of ramen \u2014 look artistic and stunning. But the drawback was that the iPhone 8 Plus was so bulky that it was miserable to carry around and using the device with one hand felt impossible.That means the iPhone X\u2019s dual-lens camera and phone size may be a major draw for people. The iPhone X\u2019s camera is slightly better than the camera on the iPhone 8 Plus because one lens has a higher aperture to let in more light. As a result, Portrait mode photos looked better (subjects were even clearer in the foreground), and so did photos taken in low light.In terms of features, the iPhone X is the most impressive smartphone ever made. It\u2019s worth the $999 \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean you should buy it. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend the iPhone X to my tech-crazed friends in Silicon Valley, but the iPhone 8 is just as fast while being simpler and more familiar to use.Then again, if you are willing to get up early to line up for a $999 phone, you are probably the target demographic for the iPhone X anyway. Make sure you wear something comfortable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Navigating the Financial Side of a Relationship", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCouples can fight about anything, it\u2019s just a fact of relationships. But arguments about money have a tendency to be particularly toxic, since they\u2019re layered with deep emotional and personal history.Despite this, or maybe because of it, people tend to avoid financial talks with their partner. While standard marital advice has us studiously marking out \u201cdate nights\u201d on the calendar to keep passion alive, there\u2019s no phrase for scheduling nights to preserve fiscal harmony.I wanted to skirt that pitfall. Once a month, I have a calendar reminder pop up. It reads: \u201cHOTTALK DOLLARDOLLAR BILLS Y\u2019ALL.\u201d (Yes, in all caps.)This is a little over-the-top and ridiculous. But injecting some levity into what can be a heated and emotional discussion \u2014 one where we lay our bank accounts bare \u2014 has allowed my husband and me to laugh a bit while tackling one of the most important conversations couples can have.These chats do have their challenges, but they can also be deeply bonding. And more important, they can keep serious money problems at bay and help us save and invest more smartly. Here\u2019s how to start up your own financial date night with your partner.Your attitude about money begins in childhood, starting with your parents\u2019 behavior around spending and saving, experts said.In other words, just as you exchanged your romantic history with your partner, share your back story when it comes to money.Revealing your finances also means losing some autonomy. Many of us see our bank balance as the ultimate achievement of independence. Mr. Seaman acknowledges this and sums up those feelings as: \u201cFinally! I get to do what I want. I don\u2019t have my parents telling me what to do anymore.\u201d It\u2019s the freedom of impulse purchases and ice cream for dinner when no one else is watching.But while sharing this information may make you vulnerable and accountable, you\u2019ll also gain a new openness in your relationship.\u201cYou have to stand in the truth with your financial partner,\u201d Ms. Orman said. \u201cYou have to have the overarching goal of honesty and integrity.\u201dConsider financial date nights the moment to unburden yourself. In these discussions, \u201cfear, shame and anger are the three internal obstacles,\u201d Ms. Orman said.Mr. Seaman added that these feelings can multiply, leading to \u201ccycles of shame and spending.\u201d (Picture a closet full of unused Amazon purchases or an online poker habit.) But voicing that burden, and being met with acceptance and love from your partner, can put you on the path to healing.If you\u2019re on the receiving end of a confession from your partner, remember that having a common enemy is incredibly bonding. Teaming up to face something like student loan debt together can unite you, and these financial date nights give you the opportunity to be in the trenches together.If you\u2019ve found a system that works for you \u2014 like using only cash for purchases, money-tracking apps or a swear jar \u2014 don\u2019t assume it will work for your spouse.In her latest book, \u201cThe Four Tendencies,\u201d Ms. Rubin has identified several character traits that shape people\u2019s habits and perspectives.One of the trickiest is the \u201crebels\u201d who want to buck the rules. While rebels won\u2019t respond well to Excel spreadsheets and budgeting mandates, they can get on board with other approaches.\u201cRebels like a challenge,\u201d Ms. Rubin said. \u201cThey like to do things in unconventional ways. You could say to them: \u2018Let\u2019s do something crazy! Let\u2019s try to spend $10 a day for the next three months!\u2019\u201d and they will eagerly get on board.Another personality group, \u201cquestioners,\u201d needs to do its own research before committing. Before signing up for a 401(k), for instance, a questioner might want to see a chart showing the compound interest the account would earn.\u201cObligers\u201d seek outer accountability, so framing a financial step as a way to set a positive example for their children could motivate them. Give your partner room to zero in on his or her own approach to your shared goals.A budget can seem like drudgery: a forced diet on your spending buffet. But budgets aren\u2019t just about reining in your wallet; they\u2019re also about deciding where your money will go, road maps to shared destinations.For this reason, financial date nights should include a discussion about the dreams you\u2019d like to realize with your income.\u201cYou should talk about your financial future,\u201d Ms. Orman said. A European getaway? A three-bedroom house? A pair of matching hoverboards? These are all dreams you can save toward.Regular check-ins with your partner will keep you both excited and focused on those goals, and, if you want to get creative, you can even bring a little arts and crafts into it.\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of vision boards and making things real any way you can,\u201d Mr. Seaman said. \u201cWhen you put a little time into creating a goal chart or vision board, you\u2019re telling yourself, \u2018I believe in this.\u2019\u201d And you\u2019re giving that message to your partner, too.There\u2019s a reason my calendar reminder doesn\u2019t say, \u201cReoccurring Money Talk With Husband,\u201d which sounds so crushingly serious. A little sprinkling of silly can keep your spirits up, even if your numbers are down.\u201cYou want to have that levity. It helps people think more clearly and it helps them connect,\u201d Ms. Rubin said.Invite in humor anywhere you can, including account nicknames with personal jokes or spreadsheets with silly line items. (Our Hawaii honeymoon budget had an entry for \u201cshark repellent.\u201d) The goal isn\u2019t to avoid hard subjects, but to dodge the hostility that could surround them. And if you\u2019re laughing, you\u2019re already defusing any potential anger.But apart from humor, Ms. Rubin said, it also helps to \u201cbe mindful about shaping the experience to make it as pleasant as possible.\u201dShe suggested pairing your financial date nights with a special coffee drink or time outside on a nice day. Ms. Orman has her own approach, scheduling her financial check-ins with her wife on a relaxing Saturday night over a glass of wine. Make the setting and the associations positive, so when that calendar reminder pops up again, you\u2019re thinking, \u201cGreat!\u201d not \u201cUnsubscribe.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Plans Net Neutrality Repeal in a Victory for Telecoms", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Communications Commission released a plan on Tuesday to dismantle landmark regulations that ensure equal access to the internet, clearing the way for internet service companies to charge users more to see certain content and to curb access to some websites.The proposal, made by the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, is a sweeping repeal of rules put in place by the Obama administration. The rules prohibit high-speed internet service providers, or I.S.P.s, from stopping or slowing down the delivery of websites. They also prevent the companies from charging customers extra fees for high-quality streaming and other services.The announcement set off a fight over free speech and the control of the internet, pitting telecom titans like AT&T and Verizon against internet giants like Google and Amazon. The internet companies warned that rolling back the rules could make the telecom companies powerful gatekeepers to information and entertainment. The telecom companies say that the existing rules prevent them from offering customers a wider selection of services at higher and lower price points.\u201cUnder my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,\u201d Mr. Pai said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that\u2019s best for them.\u201dMr. Pai, a Republican who has pursued an aggressive deregulation agenda, was widely expected to have his plan approved during a meeting on Dec. 14. The two other Republicans on the commission generally vote with Mr. Pai, giving them a majority over the two Democrats.Telecom and internet companies are expected to lobby hard in Washington \u2014 and directly to the public \u2014 as they did when the current rules were adopted.Some internet companies were expected to put up a fight to prevent the proposal from taking hold. The Internet Association, an industry group, joined a legal effort in 2015 to protect the existing rules. The agency has already received 20 million public comments, many of them in opposition of changing the rules, since Mr. Pai announced the broad outlines of his thinking early this year.The big companies that provide internet access to phones and computers have fought for years against broadband regulations. Under the new plan, broadband providers will be able to block access, slow down or speed up service for its business partners in some cases \u2014 as long as they notify customers.\u201cThis action will return broadband in the U.S. to a regulatory regime that emphasizes private investment and innovation over lumbering government intervention,\u201d said Joan Marsh, a vice president at AT&T.\u201cWe are disappointed that the proposal announced today by the F.C.C. fails to maintain the strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Erin Egan, a vice president at Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cWe will work with all stakeholders committed to this principle.\u201dSmall online companies believe the proposal would hurt innovation, because telecom companies could force them to pay more for the faster connections. Only the largest companies, they say, would be able to afford the expense of making sure their sites received preferred treatment. Companies like Etsy and Pinterest, for example, credit their start to the promise of free and open access on the internet.And consumers, the online companies say, may see their costs go up if, for example, they want high-quality access to popular websites like Netflix, a company that depends on fast connections for its streaming videos. Netflix said on Tuesday that it opposed Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal.The action \u201crepresents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Google, Facebook, Amazon and other tech companies.Mr. Pai said the current rules had been adopted to stop only theoretical harm. He said the rules limit consumer choice because telecom companies cannot offer different tiers of service, for example. As a result, he said, internet service companies cannot experiment with new business models that could help them compete with online businesses like Netflix, Google and Facebook.\u201cIt\u2019s depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation,\u201d Mr. Pai said Tuesday.Comcast, one of the country\u2019s biggest broadband companies, said it would not slow websites that contain legally permitted material.\u201cWe do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content \u2014 and we will be transparent with our customers about these policies,\u201d the company said.In a call with reporters, F.C.C. officials said the blocking and slowing of some content could be seen as anticompetitive. Those practices, they said, would be policed by the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department.Mr. Pai, who was appointed chairman by President Trump in January, has eliminated numerous regulations during his first year.The agency has stripped down rules governing television broadcasters, newspapers and telecom companies that were meant to protect the public interest. On Tuesday, in addition to the net neutrality rollback, Mr. Pai announced a plan to eliminate a rule limiting any corporation from controlling broadcasts that can reach more than 39 percent of American homes.The fight over net neutrality could end up being one of his biggest and most fraught decisions. For more than a decade, the agency has struggled with how to regulate internet service, leading to extended legal battles. The rules adopted under Mr. Wheeler were upheld in 2016 by a federal appeals court in Washington.The proposal released on Tuesday will probably make its way to court as well. And companies like Google and Facebook are expected to push the public to speak out against the plan. They coordinated a huge online protest against the possible changes in July.Some of the lobbying could take place in Congress, even though it may change little because Republicans control both houses. Nevertheless, Democrats have vowed to try to reconstruct the strict rules adopted by the F.C.C. in 2015.The next three weeks promise to hold intense lobbying from both sides, but that might not be the end of it. The regulation of internet providers has already swung once on a change in the Oval Office.\u201cAs good as the F.C.C.\u2019s action is for I.S.P.s, it only assures nonregulation of broadband through 2020,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the research firm Cowen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Friday 2017: Your Best Bargain Bet Might Be a TV", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the holiday shopping seasons begins in earnest over the Thanksgiving weekend, we\u2019re spread out over the United States, capturing what the deal-seeking rush looks like this year.\u2022 If you\u2019re suiting up to hit the stores, your best bet for a bargain might be a TV. Our tech columnist Brian Chen tells you what to look for.\u2022 A humming economy does not necessarily mean consumers are planning to open their wallets any wider than they did last year.\u2022 But that might be the best argument for bargain hunting. When will your favorite stores be open? There\u2019s a list below you can check. Twice.This weekend\u2019s Black Friday deals could make it possible to buy a high-quality TV at a big discount \u2014 15 percent to 30 percent, in some cases.That could be a huge bargain considering that most TVs in the $500 range are just O.K. while high-end models cost upward of $2,000.The key points: Know the lighting in the room where you\u2019ll put it, look for a couple important features, and don\u2019t get duped.At Walmart in Commack, N.Y., on Thursday, the route to the registers was winding.Jessica Polizzi, 18, a physical therapy student at New York Institute of Technology, pushed a cart through a maze of yellow tape and black barriers. As if trapped in a corn maze, Ms. Polizzi and her mother, Jane, and brother, Martin, 17, hit a dead end before a War-Mart employee redirected them.\u201cIt\u2019s like a haunted house,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think the point of that is to disorient you and scare you, so maybe this is the same tactic.\u201dThe Polizzis have been shopping on Thanksgiving night for the last few years.\u201cThanksgiving\u2019s so low-key for us, so this is what we look forward to,\u201d Jessica Polizzi said. \u201cWe have turkey, and then this is our evening activity.\u201dAlso in line was Mohit Mundra, 37, of Hauppauge; but for Mr. Mundra, the shopping trip was nothing special.But two questions loom over the holiday shopping season: How free will Americans be with their spending when wage growth remains anemic? And how much of that money will they spend in stores, given the continuing shift toward online shopping?\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that\u2019s bouncing around a lot,\u201d said Jon Cohen, vice president of survey research for SurveyMonkey. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t rushing to save money they way they were during the downturn.\u201dBut that confidence may not translate into booming holiday sales. Most Americans plan to spend the same on their holiday shopping as last year, or less, according to the survey; only 12 percent plan to spend more.Still, two-thirds of Americans plan to shop over the long Thanksgiving weekend, according to SurveyMonkey, and nearly a quarter plan to do all or most of their holiday shopping in that period.But the shift toward online retailers means that Black Friday is not the economic indicator that it once was. Retailers \u2014 both online and brick-and-mortar \u2014 are increasingly offering deals days or even weeks ahead of Thanksgiving, and consumers have learned that the best prices on some items come later in the holiday season.Your local Walmart is open now (it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, this is pretty much a given). Kmart and two big outdoors emporiums, Cabela\u2019s and Bass Pro Shops, were open this morning before you got the turkey in the oven.Other major retailers including Target, Best Buy and Kohl\u2019s have opted to wait until the late afternoon.One retailer that chose to stay closed on Thanksgiving? T-Mobile, which had opened last year. John Legere, the mobile carrier\u2019s chief executive, said he wanted everyone to \u201cgive thanks with family, friends and loved ones.\u201dThe best part is you don\u2019t have to get out of your chair to chase them down.There are suggestions at every price point, so it\u2019s a good resource if you\u2019re buying for a gift exchange at work or a loved one. After all, somebody in your life must need a kayak.Frustrations with online shopping with an slow internet connection drove some Iowa shoppers out of their homes on Thursday to find the best deals in person.In Eastern Iowa, broadband service is not yet ubiquitous. A 2016 report from the Federal Communications Commission found that 37 percent of rural Iowans lacked broadband access.Keshia Bolsinger, 31, a store manager for U.S. Cellular, is among them. In Garber, her tiny town in Clayton County, there is only one option for internet: DSL. When she turned to her iPhone to peruse Black Friday deals on Walmart.com, she ran into trouble.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really cooperating,\u201d Ms. Bolsinger said. \u201cIt started freezing and kicked me out.\u201dShe enlisted her mother to babysit her four children and adjusted the time of her Thanksgiving meal to allow her to drive to a Walmart in nearby Manchester.For Scott Miller, 44, a pet store operator in Manchester, shopping from the comfort of his couch is not an option: He does not have internet. He arranged to have his Thanksgiving meal at noon so he could leave his family and nab a 43\u201d Vizio HDTV for $197. He waited for three hours for the sale to begin.\u201cIt was boring,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cI just stood there, twiddling my fingers.\u201dAs broadband access here increases, that wait could vanish.Richard Larson, a professor at M.I.T. who has spent years studying line behavior \u2014 he\u2019s known as Dr. Queue in academic circles \u2014 said that the enthusiasm for Black Friday lines \u201cmakes sense, in some weird way.\u201dThe once-a-year lines are \u201cexhilarating,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re the kind you might tell your grandchildren about.\u201dThe scarcity of bargains means shoppers can enjoy a sense of accomplishment after braving the lines.\u201cPeople\u2019s willingness to wait is, in some sense, proportional to the perceived value of whatever they\u2019re waiting to acquire,\u201d Professor Larson said. \u201cEven if they don\u2019t know what the line is for, they reason that whatever\u2019s at the end of it must be fantastically valuable.\u201dThe Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade has been a holiday tradition for nearly a century, an annual reminder that one of the most recognizable names in retail is just the place to get the shopping season started.Macy\u2019s real estate holdings, from mall storefronts to grand buildings \u2014 most notably the Herald Square location that serves as the backdrop for the parade on TV \u2014 are worth more than the company\u2019s market value.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Originals That Don\u2019t Get to the Theater", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingNetflix\u2019s disinclination to release its original films in theaters has earned the company disapprobation from cinephiles, and caused a brouhaha at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival. There\u2019s a logic to this: The company is a video streaming service, after all. Hardly anybody complains that HBO doesn\u2019t release its films theatrically. The difference has to do with conventional wisdom. Because Netflix is producing significant films by celebrated directors like Bong Joon-ho (this year\u2019s \u201cOkja\u201d) and Martin Scorsese (whose \u201cThe Irishman\u201d will make its Netflix premiere in early 2019), there\u2019s a perceived imperative that they need to be seen on large screens and in the company of a lot of other people.And yet, nobody demanded that \u201cPublic Speaking,\u201d a 2010 documentary about the writer Fran Lebowitz that was 100 percent directed by Martin Scorsese for HBO, get a theatrical run. What can I tell you? There\u2019s a tendency for some to see a film made for television as somehow not a proper film. It takes years to change that perception (see Rainer Werner Fassbinder\u2019s early \u201970s TV movie \u201cWorld on a Wire\u201d or his monumental limited TV series \u201cBerlin Alexanderplatz\u201d).\u201cCreep 2,\u201d produced in part by Netflix, is streaming now on Amazon, Fandango, Google Play and iTunes and is coming to Netflix later this year. Spoiler alert: Since the sequel takes up where the 2014 original, \u201cCreep,\u201d ended, it begins with Mark Duplass playing the same serial killer as before. The hook in both pictures, very appropriate for postmodern microbudget filmmaking, is that this killer attracts his victims by soliciting for videographers on Craigslist. The twist here, if it can be called that, is that Mr. Duplass\u2019s serial killer admits right off to the failed webcaster Sara (Desiree Akhavan) that he\u2019s a murderer. He wants the video he\u2019s commissioned to be his testament. Pairing male serial killer with female videographer might generate some tensions beyond the usual, and indeed, Mr. Duplass\u2019s character gets buck naked in front of Sara\u2019s camera in the first step of what he deems a trust-building exercise. But this movie generates most of its shocks the same way the first one did: via use of a deliberately clunky subjective camera, in front of which Mr. Duplass will periodically jump from behind a door or a corner and scream \u201cBoo!\u201d or some variant thereof. As Orson Welles once said, \u201cunrewarding.\u201dI had higher hopes for \u201c1922,\u201d adapted from a novella by Stephen King that\u2019s unrelentingly grim, even by his standards. It tells the story of a farm-life-fixated dolt who kills his wife rather than sit still for her plan to sell off her land and move to Omaha. Manipulating his teenage son\u2019s resentments, he enlists the boy in the homicide. Things get worse from there, with hallucinations (or are they?) of the walking dead and lots of rats.The film, directed by Zak Hilditch from his own screenplay, is a handsome-looking production that\u2019s sunk almost immediately by its practically reflexive devotion to cornpone clich\u00e9. On the page, the reader can hear the killer Wilfred James\u2019s words of confession \u2014 \u201cI believe there is another man inside of every man, a stranger, a Conniving Man\u201d \u2014 in any way he or she likes. In the movie, the actor Thomas Jane, as Wilfred, uses a cracker-barrel intonation that leads us to believe that at any moment he may punctuate his narration with the old faux-homey TV ad for baked goods: \u201cPepperidge Farm remembers.\u201dMr. Jane\u2019s performance is that of an actor portraying a type rather than a character, and it contrasts starkly with Molly Parker\u2019s work. Alas, Ms. Parker plays the wife, so she\u2019s not around all that long. (She comes back, but is not required to do much more than look rat-bitten, which the makeup department handles well.) Throughout the picture I kept thinking, this will surely get better as the scary scenes come around. Not only did it not get better, the scary scenes did not come around.I\u2019m hoping things look up in 2018. Eighty movies is a lot, and if too many are like these, I may lose my faith in cinema on any screen.An earlier version of this column misstated where viewers can stream the film \u201cCreep 2.\u201d It is currently available on Amazon, Fandango, Google Play and iTunes, not on Netflix.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Pass Another Milestone, as Investors Remain Fearless", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the longest stock-market booms in history continued its gravity-defying ascent Thursday, with investors cheering the prospect of deep corporate tax cuts and the rollback of government regulations under President Trump.The Dow Jones industrial average eclipsed yet another milestone, closing Thursday above 24,000 for the first time. And the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index logged its 13th straight month of gains, the longest such streak in history.Stock markets have been going up, more or less without interruption, since March 2009, the end of the acute phase of the global financial crisis. This eight-and-a-half-year bull market is now the second-longest in history, behind only the rally that lasted from 1987 until 2000.Investors are embracing Mr. Trump\u2019s pro-corporate presidency, marked by the promise of lower taxes, the installation of former industry executives in key government agencies, and the repeal or relaxation of rules and regulations that have made it hard for some big businesses to expand without fear of interference from Washington.Indeed, the view is taking hold that Mr. Trump, in so aggressively promoting policies aimed to stoke the economy and financial markets, has unleashed animal spirits \u2014 largely absent under President Barack Obama \u2014 that are now reflected in ever rising consumer confidence indicators and a willingness to embrace risk in the stock market.\u201cIt comes down to psychology, and the psychology today is that everything is awesome,\u201d said Charlie Bilello, a stock market historian at Pension Partners. \u201cJobs have grown for 85 straight months, you have growth in corporate earnings, and you have tax cuts.\u201dMore than anything, enthusiasm about life being more pleasant for corporate America is propelling stocks. This week, investors were thrilled by the signs that a normally dysfunctional Washington is coalescing around a tax-cut package that would go straight to the bottom line of businesses and their owners.Of course, there is no guarantee the tax-cut package will become law. That is a potential tripwire for markets.\u201cIf the tax reform doesn\u2019t get done, I think there will be a pretty sharp correction,\u201d said Bruce Van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, one of the largest banking companies in the northeastern United States.Mr. Van Saun said stock markets could plunge as much as 15 percent if the tax cut was derailed in Congress. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite pivotal right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe businessperson has an expectation that this will get done.\u201dThese milestones, of course, are arbitrary. Passing a round number in a particular index isn\u2019t itself significant.But the ease with which the barrier was cleared highlights the extent to which investors are willing to look past geopolitical uncertainty and pricey stock valuations and bet that the market will keep going up.\u201cPeople are assuming this is normal \u2014 but it is not,\u201d Mr. Bilello said. \u201cThe relationship between risk and reward has broken down.\u201dIs this a bubble that\u2019s about to pop? Investment experts are divided.Skeptics point to the fact that many stocks, especially in the technology sector, are at historically high levels. Investors, they note, are relying on debt to amplify their returns. And a tulip-style mania has sent the price of the digital currency Bitcoin soaring.But even more investors are bullish. Sure, valuations are high, but in contrast to 2000, when Silicon Valley was littered with companies without business models, today\u2019s tech behemoths \u2014 including Facebook and Amazon \u2014 are fundamentally sound. And a round of tax cuts could further fatten corporate profits. As for Bitcoin, if it crashes there is no direct reason it should necessarily drag down stocks.Ed Yardeni, an independent stock market strategist, has identified 58 of these small market panics since 2009. This year, he has not seen a single one.\u201cThis is starting to feel like a melt-up,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said, describing a feverish state of a bull market when investors discard all fears. \u201cThe market has climbed a wall of worry, but now it seems as if there is nothing to worry about.\u201dThat, Mr. Yardeni said, is itself something to worry about, because investors are throwing caution to the wind.According to Mr. Bilello, the stock analyst, a typical year will include three or four stock market corrections. In 2017, there have been none. The worst swoon this year was a 3.3 percent fall between March 2 and April 19.Such a relentless \u2014 and smooth \u2014 rise in stocks is very unusual.Several unprecedented factors might be helping the rally, analysts say. For the first time ever, an American president is actively promoting a stock market surge. Mr. Trump has tweeted often about the stock market, including eight times this week alone.A president\u2019s boasting about the market doesn\u2019t mean it should keep going up. But at these high levels, psychology becomes a critical factor that can move stocks higher.That could mean your brother-in-law praising his portfolio at a cocktail party \u2014 or the president of the United States speaking more broadly to his 43 million followers on Twitter.It doesn\u2019t hurt that there has never been a time when the global economy has been growing so strongly while central banks kept interest rates so low.Traditionally, bull markets come to an end when, after a sustained period of growth, inflation forces central banks to raise rates.Now, with inflation stagnant and the lingering anxieties of the 2008 financial crisis fading, investors are not ready to contemplate the end of the party.For example, the latest missile scare from North Korea, after so many previous flare-ups, barely caused investors to bat an eyelid.\u201cI used to call my clients fully invested bears,\u201d said Mr. Yardeni, the investment strategist. \u201cNow they are giddy bulls \u2014 how could they not be?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trump Administration\u2019s Incoherent Stance on Competition", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPeter Thiel, Facebook\u2019s first outside investor, once wrote: \u201cCompetition is for losers. If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly.\u201d Executives at Facebook, Google and Amazon seem to have taken his blunt advice.If only the Trump administration could be so clear when it comes to its stance on competition. Instead, it has sent a schizophrenic message, which means the few remaining companies with a chance to rival big tech have no way of knowing where the administration stands or what values it will enforce.The incoherence of these conflicting positions on competition is staggering, but this kind of cognitive dissonance is not unique. Don\u2019t forget that the Obama administration \u2014 at the behest of Amazon, which controlled almost 80 percent of the online book market \u2014 brought an antitrust suit alleging Apple and five publishers colluded on pricing for digital books. That administration did not have a consistent view of media monopoly power that is enforced equally on all parties, and neither does the current one.For instance, internet service providers operate under a totally different set of privacy regulations than the online service providers (like Google and Facebook) that dominate the online advertising market. According to Morgan Stanley, Google and Facebook took an astonishing 85 percent of all new online ad revenue last year. And yet Google spends millions lobbying Congress to prevent any rivals from entering its unique surveillance capitalism business. Essentially, the government is giving a pass to the largest media advertising firms that have no restrictions on consumer privacy, while suing to block potential rival services that operate under strict privacy restrictions.Of course, being buried deep in Google\u2019s search results or being forced to pay Google for prominent placement hurts smaller firms. This is arguably no less harmful to a business than being forced to pay Verizon for good video quality for its streaming site \u2014 the fate that many content producers will meet if net neutrality rules are rolled back under the plan the F.C.C. has hinted at. It is what economists call \u201crent seeking,\u201d and it is a cancer on any open media system in any context, but the Trump administration doesn\u2019t treat it the same in all contexts.Mr. Trump is nothing if not sensitive to a populist uprising, and the net neutrality decision will probably be opposed on both the left and right. It could be that during the F.C.C.\u2019s comment period, the resistance to overturning net neutrality may be too strong and the ruling will be withdrawn.But that leaves the larger questions unanswered. What exactly would a consistent antitrust policy for the media sector look like? Is it possible to reconcile the conflicting signals from the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice?The answer is that regulators must realize where the real market power lies and use this as the basis for their decisions about competition. Time Warner\u2019s market capitalization is $70 billion. Google is worth 10 times as much, at $723 billion. Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner\u2019s largest advertising subsidiary, brought in $1.2 billion in ad revenue in the last quarter, while Google reported $22.5 billion in ad revenue in the same period. It should be noted that AT&T has almost no appreciable ad revenue. So, if there is to be a coherent approach to competition, the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates Google and Facebook, and the F.C.C., which regulates AT&T, must find common ground on the regulation of ad-supported content networks.For the Trump administration to try to block the merger of two relatively small media players while letting Google operate freely with no privacy restrictions is to be fighting the last war. The notion that television is the major media power in America ignores reality. It may be that the assistant attorney general for antitrust, Makan Delrahim, has a decent case that internet service providers and content providers need some sort of separation. But if that is true, then the same rules on neutrality and consumer privacy need to apply to companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 and the F.C.C. should keep net neutrality rules in place.The administration can\u2019t have it both ways.Jonathan Taplin is the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.I. Researchers Leave Elon Musk Lab to Begin Robotics Start-Up", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEMERYVILLE, Calif. \u2014 During a recent speech at the University of California, Berkeley, Pieter Abbeel played a video clip of a robot doing housework.The trick was that an engineer was operating the robot from afar, dictating its every move. But as Mr. Abbeel explained, the video showed that robotic hardware was nimble enough to mimic complex human behavior. It just needed software that could guide the hardware \u2014 without the help of that engineer.\u201cThis is largely a computer science problem \u2014 an artificial intelligence problem,\u201d Mr. Abbeel said. \u201cWe have the hardware that can do the job.\u201dTheir start-up, Embodied Intelligence, is backed by $7 million in funding from the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Amplify Partners and other investors. The company will specialize in complex algorithms that allow machines to learn tasks on their own. Using these methods, existing robots could learn to, for example, install car parts that aren\u2019t quite like the parts they have installed in the past, sort through a bucket of random holiday gifts as they arrive at a warehouse, or perform other tasks that machines traditionally could not.\u201cWe now have teachable robots,\u201d Mr. Abbeel said during a recent interview at the new company\u2019s offices in Emeryville, Calif., just across the bay from San Francisco.Robots already automate some work inside factories and warehouses, such as moving boxes from place to place at Amazon\u2019s massive distribution centers. But companies must program these machines for each particular task, limiting their possible applications. The hope is that robots can master a much wider array of tasks by learning on their own.\u201cToday, every motion that an industrial robot makes is specified down to the millimeter,\u201d said Sunil Dhaliwal, the Amplify founder who led the firm\u2019s investment in Embodied Intelligence. \u201cBut most real problems can\u2019t be solved that way. You have to be able not just to tell the robot what to do, but to tell it how to learn.\u201dMuch like Google and labs at Brown and Northeastern University, Embodied Intelligence is also augmenting these methods with a wide range of other machine learning techniques. Most notably, the start-up is exploring what is called imitation learning, a way for machines to learn discrete tasks from human demonstrations.The company is using this method to teach a two-armed robot to pick up plastic pipes from a table. Donning virtual reality headsets and holding motion trackers in their hands, Mr. Abbeel and his colleagues will repeatedly demonstrate the task in a digital world that recreates what is in front of a robot. Then the machine can then learn from this digital data.\u201cWe collect data on what the human is doing,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cThen we can train the machine to imitate the human.\u201dThese and similar machine learning methods have only begun to bear fruit over the past few years, but many believe they will overhaul the field of robotics. It is telling that OpenAI, a pure research lab that opened its doors less than two years ago, has now lost two big names to more commercial pursuits.Poached away from OpenAI by Mr. Musk himself, the machine learning expert Andrej Karpathy is now the director of A.I. at Tesla, working to help autonomous cars get smarter faster. And Mr. Abbeel is launching Embodied Intelligence. \u201cAndrej is stepping out of the research mode and saying: \u2018I want to do this in practice,\u2019\u201d Mr. Abbeel explained. \u201cThat same thing goes for us.\u201dHe said he believed his new start-up can rapidly push its methods into manufacturing operations like the auto industry. Although robotics already handle many tasks inside such factories, there are many others they can\u2019t yet master. That is what Embodied Intelligence hopes to change.Some researchers question how much these machine learning techniques will ultimately improve robotics, believing they are overhyped among both researchers and the news media. \u201cMachine learning is being thrown at so many problems in robotics,\u201d said Robert Howe, a professor of robotics at Harvard University. \u201cAnd it produces just enough results that people can trumpet it.\u201dBut Mr. Abbeel is among the world\u2019s top researchers in his field, and his decision to start a own company is an indication that machine learning will continue to push robotics forward.\u201cIt is obvious that this is what you need to build flexible, agile robotics,\u201d said Geoff Hinton, a pioneer of machine learning.Follow Cade Metz on Twiiter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "The Paradise PapersThe tech giant has found a tax haven in the island of Jersey, leaving billions of dollars untouched by the United States, leaked documents reveal.Supported byTim Cook was angry.\u201cWe pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar,\u201d Mr. Cook declared at the hearing. \u201cWe don\u2019t depend on tax gimmicks,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe don\u2019t stash money on some Caribbean island.\u201dTrue enough. The island Apple would soon rely on was in the English Channel.Five months after Mr. Cook\u2019s testimony, Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the small island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income.Apple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.The previously undisclosed story of Apple\u2019s search for a new tax haven and its use of Jersey is among the findings emerging from a cache of secret corporate records from Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm that caters to businesses and the wealthy elite.The documents reveal how big law firms help clients weave their way through the gaps between different countries\u2019 tax rules. Appleby clients have transferred trademarks, patent rights and other valuable assets into offshore shell companies, avoiding billions of dollars in taxes. The rights to Nike\u2019s Swoosh trademark, Uber\u2019s taxi-hailing app, Allergan\u2019s Botox patents and Facebook\u2019s social media technology have all resided in shell companies that listed as their headquarters Appleby offices in Bermuda and Grand Cayman, the records show.\u201cU.S. multinational firms are the global grandmasters of tax avoidance schemes that deplete not just U.S. tax collection but the tax collection of most every large economy in the world,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a former corporate tax adviser to such companies who is now a law professor at the University of Southern California.Indeed, tax strategies like the ones used by Apple \u2014 as well as Amazon, Google, Starbucks and others \u2014 cost governments around the world as much as $240 billion a year in lost revenue, according to a 2015 estimate by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The disclosures come on the heels of last week\u2019s proposals by Republican lawmakers to provide several new tax benefits for multinational companies, including cutting the federal corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. President Trump has said that American businesses are getting a bad deal under current rules.But the documents show how major American companies find creative ways to avoid paying anything close to 35 percent.Apple, for example, pays taxes at a small fraction of that rate on its offshore profits, according to calculations by The Times based on the company\u2019s securities filings. Apple reports that nearly 70 percent of its worldwide profits are earned offshore.An Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, declined to answer most questions about the company\u2019s tax strategy. He did say that Apple had told regulators \u2014 in the United States and Ireland and at the European Commission \u2014 about the reorganization of its Irish subsidiaries. \u201cThe changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cAt Apple we follow the laws, and if the system changes we will comply. We strongly support efforts from the global community toward comprehensive international tax reform and a far simpler system.\u201dIn prepared statements, Allergan, Facebook, Nike and Uber said they complied with tax regulations around the world.Congressional Republicans are also seeking to impose a 10 percent tax on some of the profits that American businesses say are earned offshore \u2014 half the rate they are proposing for profits in the United States. The lawmakers have also proposed another break, permitting multinationals to bring home more than $2.6 trillion stowed offshore at sharply reduced tax rates. Both proposals, critics say, would only create additional incentives for businesses like Apple to shift more profits into island hideaways.Appleby is a member of the global network of lawyers, accountants and bankers who set up or manage offshore companies and accounts for clients who want to avoid taxes or keep their finances a secret from authorities, business partners or even spouses. The firm did not respond to questions from The Times about its work for Apple or other companies.Tax authorities have challenged several of the offshore structures maintained by Appleby and Estera, a spinoff of the law firm\u2019s corporate services business. Nike won a fight over back taxes with the Internal Revenue Service a year ago; a similar dispute between the I.R.S. and Facebook is continuing.European regulators are trying to force countries including Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to collect back taxes from big companies that relied on offshore arrangements. Apple is being pursued for $14.5 billion in back taxes after European regulators ruled that its old tax structure amounted to illegal state aid from the Irish government.Since the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens. Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions \u2014 mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2014 now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the world\u2019s population.Criticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.In May 2013, the Senate\u2019s investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apple\u2019s tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared \u201ctax residency\u201d nowhere in the world.Under Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is \u201cmanaged and controlled\u201d abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax. By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.At the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there. The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.\u201cApple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,\u201d then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.Ireland\u2019s finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, at first defended his country\u2019s policies: \u201cI do not want to be the whipping boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.\u201d Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies. Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.But by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.At that time, Apple had accumulated $111 billion in offshore cash, mostly in its Irish subsidiaries. Billions of dollars in new profits poured into them each year. Yet they paid almost no corporate income tax.Company officials wanted to keep it that way. So Apple sought alternatives to the tax arrangement Ireland would soon shut down. And the officials wanted to be quiet about it.\u201cFor those of you who are not aware Apple are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,\u201d wrote Cameron Adderley, global head of Appleby\u2019s corporate department, in a March 20, 2014 email to other senior partners. \u201cThey also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.\u201dIn building Apple\u2019s new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor. A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago. The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax regulators. It has also fought international proposals for tax avoidance crackdowns.Baker McKenzie wanted to use a local Appleby office to maintain an offshore arrangement for Apple. For Appleby, Mr. Adderley said, this assignment was \u201ca tremendous opportunity for us to shine on a global basis with Baker McKenzie.\u201dBaker McKenzie\u2019s San Francisco office emailed a 14-item questionnaire in March 2014 to Appleby\u2019s offices in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey.\u201cConfirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities (such as board meetings, signing of important contracts) without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction,\u201d the document requested. Baker McKenzie also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: \u201cAre there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?\u201d(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, \u201cAs a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.\u201d)Apple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Appleby\u2019s office in Jersey, which is one of the Channel Islands and has strong links to the British banking system. Jersey makes its own laws and is not subject to most European Union legislation, making it a popular tax haven.But the plan to use Jersey faced a potential snag: In mid-2014, again under pressure from other governments, Irish ministers explored ending a tax shelter known as the \u201cdouble Irish,\u201d used by scores of companies, including the Appleby clients Allergan and Facebook, as well as Google, LinkedIn and other businesses.The double Irish allows companies to collect profits through one subsidiary that employs people in Ireland, then route those profits to an Irish mailbox subsidiary that is a tax resident of an offshore haven like Bermuda, Grand Cayman or the Isle of Man.Irish officials explored a ban on Irish companies claiming tax residency in tax havens. Executives at Allergan \u2014 which had used a double Irish for at least a decade, records show \u2014 tried to derail the rule change. Terilea Wielenga, then Allergan\u2019s head of tax, was also international president of the Tax Executives Institute, a trade group. She argued to the Irish finance ministry in July 2014 that any such changes should occur slowly.The campaign seemed to work. \u201cFor existing companies, there will be provision for a transition period until the end of 2020,\u201d Mr. Noonan declared in October 2014. The gradual phase-in would apply not just to existing companies but to any new ones created by December of that year.This gave Apple just enough time. By the end of the year, Jersey had become the new tax home of the Irish companies Apple Sales International and Apple Operations International.But a third Apple subsidiary, Apple Operations Europe, became resident in Ireland.Apple would not say why. But tax experts offer one possible reason. While media attention focused on Ireland\u2019s crackdown on the double Irish, officials announced a new measure: The country expanded its tax deductions for companies that move rights to intellectual property \u2014 like patents and trademarks \u2014 into Ireland. If an Irish company spent $15 billion buying such rights, even from a fellow subsidiary, it could claim a $1 billion tax deduction each year for 15 years.Apple declined to say whether it has availed itself of the new benefit.But J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova law professor and former I.R.S. official who reviewed the Appleby documents, concluded that there was a strong possibility the company moved intellectual property into Ireland to take advantage of the generous tax rules. Based on Apple\u2019s American securities filings, he estimated that the transfer was worth about $200 billion.That would mean that any income that Apple now generates in Ireland could be partially offset by more than $13 billion in tax deductions each year for 15 years.Apple\u2019s hunt for a tax haven is a familiar tale, said Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, who also reviewed the Appleby documents.\u201cThis is how it usually works: You close one tax shelter, and something else opens up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just goes on endlessly.\u201dSimon Bowers is a reporter for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who\u2019s a Hero? Who\u2019s a Villain? It\u2019s Anyone\u2019s Guess in This Fall\u2019s Best Y.A. Fantasy", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChildren\u2019s BooksEmika Chen is a rainbow-haired, electric skateboarding teenage bounty hunter in a futuristic New York City who, on the verge of getting evicted from her ratty apartment, glitches her way into a massively popular virtual reality game to steal a valuable power-up. The book opens with a mock news story about the game\u2019s 21-year-old creator, the mysterious Hideo Tanaka; an appended correction notes: \u201cAn earlier version of this story mistakenly described Hideo Tanaka as a millionaire. He is a billionaire.\u201d Whoops. Hideo, impressed that Emika has managed to breach his system (this is also a metaphor), flies her to Tokyo in his private jet to compete as a wild card in the international Warcross championships and figure out the identity of a certain nefarious cybercriminal.The book is as visual, kinetic and furiously paced as any video game; Lu, a former art director for video games as well as the author of the best-selling Legend series, has quite the way with otherworldly action scenes. Each round of the game is played in a different immersive environment; special NeuroLink glasses allow the real and virtual worlds to mesh. One particularly vivid round takes place in an icy wilderness filled with glaciers, \u201cshifting and cracking under their own weight,\u201d with monstrous animals frozen inside them \u2014 a white wolf with a missing eye, a snakelike dragon, a woolly mammoth. There\u2019s romance, a lost sibling, spying, a diverse cast of gamers and nifty tattoos. It\u2019s \u201cGleaming the Cube\u201d meets \u201cStrange Days\u201d meets \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d and it\u2019s a lot of fun. If the cliffhanger ending seems irksome, never fear, this one\u2019s a series opener.So much cool stuff but, alas, so little editing. Set in the Gothamesque Gatlon City, this first in a series introduces powerful superheroes and their down-but-not-out nemeses. Years ago, the Renegades (the good guys \u2014 or are they?) defeated the Anarchists, who have retreated to crumbling subway tunnels. Teenage Anarchist Nova (villain name: Nightmare), who blames the Renegades and their governing Council for her parents\u2019 murder, goes undercover to infiltrate them. But she doesn\u2019t count on an attraction to the enigmatic and hot Adrian, whose two dads are Renegade royalty, Captain Chromium and the Dread Warden. He and Nova debate the idea of vigilante justice and question whether Renegades allow regular people to shrug off responsibility for creating an ethical society.There are dozens of characters and secret identities, and awkward phrases like \u201chis pallor was ghastly pale\u201d and \u201chis face took on a look of exultation.\u201d It can feel like a too-long X-Men movie. But some of the characters\u2019 powers are superfun (creating tattoos and drawings that become real, controlling an army of bees) and when everyone learns everyone else\u2019s identities and secret pasts \u2014 presumably in the next book \u2014 well, Holy Surprise Party, Batman.Feminism is the invisible jet powering this literary revamp of the Amazon princess. Bardugo\u2019s version offers a new explanation for Princess Diana\u2019s departure from Themyscira. A young woman named Alia Mayeux Keralis is shipwrecked off the coast, and Diana rescues her. But Alia is a Warbringer, a descendant of Helen of Troy whose very presence causes conflict and chaos. If Diana can help Alia get to Helen\u2019s final resting place before time runs out, she can change Alia\u2019s destiny \u2026 and the world\u2019s.After a slow start (the somber Themysciran scene-setting and stilted, formal way the Amazons speak aren\u2019t much fun), the plot takes off, with a lot of action and humor. Alia, who is half Greek-American and half black, brings Diana to her country. (When the duo magically land in New York Harbor, Diana looks up to see \u201ca vibrant yellow torch held aloft by the statue of an Amazon, her stern face framed by a crown like a sunburst.\u201d) They team up with Alia\u2019s older brother Jason, crush object Theo and best friend Nim, racing to change the course of history. Meanwhile, terrifying gods of war and chaos, as well as human soldiers, keep attacking. Nim is a delicious character \u2014 an asymmetrical-haircut-sporting Indian-American girl with multiple piercings and a wicked sense of humor. Bardugo makes her both fat and hot, describing her as a \u201csparkly, round-cheeked sparrow.\u201dAs always, Diana\u2019s interactions with the Western world are a good time (\u201cIs Google one of your gods?\u201d she asks). And it\u2019s lovely that this is a hero\u2019s journey times two. Alia taps into her own bravery and Diana learns about sexism, racism and something the Amazons have always dismissed: the courage, resilience and ingenuity of mere mortals.Every sentence in this gorgeous little novel feels perfect and necessary. Ness, a Carnegie Medal winner, has said that \u201cRelease\u201d is influenced by two classics: Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cMrs Dalloway\u201d and Judy Blume\u2019s \u201cForever.\u201d (I know, right?) The book has the structure of the former \u2014 a vast amount of emotional action packed into a single day \u2014 and the hyperintensity, sexual heat and empathy for teenagers of the latter. Adam Thorn is 17 and gay, a conservative preacher\u2019s son trapped in rural Washington State. He wants to love and be loved, and he wants to feel understood. He picks up a rose at a flower shop (who will he give it to? His best friend, Angela? His ex, Enzo? His current boyfriend, Linus?) and pricks his thumb \u2026 and as the drop of blood falls we\u2019re suddenly in a different world. There\u2019s a Queen, a faun, a vengeful spirit, a murder and a sense of encroaching doom.The action switches back and forth between the two worlds, both filled with grief and loss and mistakes. Gradually, it becomes clear that both narratives are about the power of a single moment to change everything. It sounds heavy, but it isn\u2019t \u2014 Adam and his friends are very funny, and seeing flawed characters trying their hardest to forgive and to grow is truly touching. Also, the sex scenes are so hot they practically set the pages on fire. Ness\u2019s writing is lush without seeming to strain: A bad boyfriend is \u201call neck and rage,\u201d Mount Rainier at sunset turns \u201can unseemly, intimate pink.\u201d In an era when young adult books often feel bloated and meandering, this focused, humane book is a joy.\u201cIn Other Lands\u201d is at once a classic school story, a coming-of-age tale and a parody of Harry Potter. It\u2019s hilarious and sneakily moving. Elliot Schafer is Harry Potter if Harry had been abandoned instead of merely orphaned. Convinced of his unlovability, he wields sarcasm and braininess as weapons.As the book opens, Elliot is 13. On a field trip to Devon, England, he sees a wall few other kids can see. On the other side: the otherlands. Elliot, a huge reader of fantasy novels, is thrilled. Alas, the humans and harpies and trolls and elves and mermaids and vicious red-eyed, virginity-obsessed unicorns populating the otherlands turn out to be perpetually at war, and Elliot is a pacifist. \u201cOh no,\u201d he moans, as a dagger flies by his head. \u201cThis is magic Sparta.\u201d But he has no reason to go home, so he enters the Border camp\u2019s councilor-in-training program. And he makes two non-nerd friends: A gorgeous elf named Serene-Heart-in-the-Chaos-of-Battle and a perfect-seeming blond human jock.Brennan subverts the familiar Y.A. love triangle in uproarious, touching, unexpected ways, and her commentaries on gender roles, sexual identity and toxic masculinity are very witty. Elven culture, for instance, views men as the weaker sex. \u201cA true gentleman\u2019s heart is as sacred as a temple, and as easily crushed as a flower,\u201d Serene informs Elliot. When another elf tells him, \u201cI was saddened to hear Serene had launched a successful attack on the citadel of your virtue,\u201d Elliot assures her, \u201cThe citadel was totally into surrendering.\u201d Best of all, over four years in the otherlands, Elliot grows from a defensive, furious, grieving child into a diplomatic, kind, menschy hero.Marjorie Ingall is a columnist for Tablet and the author of \u201cMamaleh Knows Best: What Jewish Mothers Do to Raise Successful, Creative, Empathetic, Independent Children.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Well, 15 million people watched the premiere episode of the most recent season of \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d the biggest hit on cable; the first episode of NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us\u201d was watched by 17.8 million people; and the premiere episode of the latest season of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d was watched by 22 million people. The season finale of HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d had 14.8 million viewers within three days of its broadcast; the premium cable network said that more than 30 million people watched each episode this past season once streaming numbers were factored in.In a statement on Thursday, a spokeswoman said, \u201cTheir math might be from the upside down,\u201d referring to the alternate dimension in \u201cStranger Things.\u201dNielsen\u2019s data is drawn from television sets using audio recognition software, so it cannot measure viewers who watch a Netflix show on a tablet, laptop or phone.

Nielsen does not yet track Amazon or Hulu but said it hopes to.According to Nielsen, the ratings decline for each episode of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d though that likely has to do with the fact that a viewer can\u2019t get to all of the episodes within three days.Nielsen did say that 4.6 million viewers finished the entire nine-episode season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d between Friday and Sunday last weekend.

{"Headline": "Review: Amazon\u2019s New Pilots, the End of an Era?", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo the three new Amazon comedy pilots may be the last of their breed \u2014 mildly eccentric, indie-style half-hours with no tent-pole names attached. It\u2019s also notable that each, in its different way, is centered on a woman who deserves more from life. If Amazon is abandoning the art house (online-streaming division) for the multiplex, we won\u2019t see shows like these any time soon.This alt-zombie story comes with plenty of highbrow cred: It\u2019s written by George Saunders, the recent winner of the Man Booker Prize, and directed by Hiro Murai, Donald Glover\u2019s collaborator on \u201cAtlanta.\u201dMr. Murai gives \u201cSea Oak\u201d (the name of the housing complex where Bernie lives with a gaggle of adult nieces and nephews) the slightly anesthetized, Jim Jarmusch vibe he and Mr. Glover bring to \u201cAtlanta,\u201d but Mr. Saunders\u2019s Rust Belt magic realism doesn\u2019t carry the same force onscreen, at least in this initial half-hour.The most jumbled but also most distinctive of the three pilots is this piece about an office drone who dreams of being a social-media star. Set and filmed in Detroit, \u201cThe Climb\u201d is like a more profane but also more buttoned-up, and no less cerebral, companion to Issa Rae\u2019s HBO comedy \u201cInsecure.\u201dThe bulk of the half-hour, in which Ms. Everett\u2019s character, Karen, works with the young residents of a home for people with Down syndrome, is standard sitcom stuff (even with an A plot that involves a teenager with a propensity for touching Karen\u2019s breasts). It\u2019s the biggest showcase so far for Ms. Everett\u2019s knowing, tough but vulnerable persona, and it gives her occasions to sing, including a production number about buying a bra (which is, once again, focused on her body).Stealing attention from Ms. Everett is a tall order, but Loni Anderson manages it in a supporting role as Karen\u2019s guileless older roommate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Upside of Being Ruled by the Five Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. But what if that\u2019s not so bad?For a year and a half \u2014 and more urgently for much of the last month \u2014 I have warned of the growing economic, social and political power held by the five largest American tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.That\u2019s not ridiculous. Over the last few weeks, several scholars said there are good reasons to be sanguine about our new tech overlords. Below, I compiled their best arguments about the bright side of the Five.Tech is inherently messy. The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them. This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow. The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo \u2014 and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides.One benefit of having five giant companies in charge of today\u2019s tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems.Consider Russian propaganda. People have worried about the internet\u2019s capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades \u2014 from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism \u2014 the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation. But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies \u2014 one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs \u2014 it was never conceivable to limit that era\u2019s equivalent of fake news.Today, it suddenly is. Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control.This does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates \u2014 and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression. But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms.\u201cThis is new stuff everybody is dealing with \u2014 it\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of \u201cBig Is Beautiful,\u201d a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies. (The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.) \u201cSo when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier. You\u2019ve got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor.\u201dOver the last few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome \u2014 so why was I including their company in that group?This dynamic \u2014 where each company competes mightily against the others \u2014 suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d with Mr. Atkinson. \u201cAs long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then what\u2019s to complain about?\u201dYou can see this in their product road maps. None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control \u2014 for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop.At the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies. And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways \u2014 with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics.\u201cSo, why pre-emptively say that maybe we\u2019ll be harmed in the future \u2014 that in 2030 they\u2019ll jack up their prices or something?\u201d Mr. Lind asked. \u201cWell, deal with that as it comes.\u201dThe Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale. Thanks to economic dynamics like network effects \u2014 where a product, like Facebook, gets more useful as more people use it \u2014 it was perhaps inevitable that we would see the rise of a handful of large companies take control of much of the modern tech business.I don\u2019t mean this list to get the Five off the hook. How we deal with their efforts to capture more power over the economy and our society is perhaps the next great question facing America. But this is a complex problem precisely because there are both advantages and disadvantages to their size.As I said, tech is messy.Advertisement"}

At the graduate level, the number is reversed: About 80 percent hail from India, China, Korea, Turkey and other foreign countries.For graduate students far from home, the swirl of cultures is both reassuring and invigorating. \u201cYou\u2019re comfortable everyone is going through the same struggles and journeys as you are,\u201d said Vibhati Joshi of Mumbai, India, who\u2019s in her final semester for a master\u2019s degree in financial engineering. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201dIn arts and humanities, the figure was about 16 percent; in business, a little more than 18 percent.Many factors contribute to the gap, but a major one is the booming job market in technology. For the most part, Americans don\u2019t see the need for an advanced degree when there are so many professional opportunities waiting for them. For some, the price is just too high when they have so much student debt already.\u201cYou can believe that U.S. bachelor\u2019s students, if they\u2019re good, can go get a job at Microsoft or Google with a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d said Edward D. Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington.Universities and employers are eager to tap the pool of international talent that helps them stay competitive globally, and graduate programs have a financial incentive in attracting them: Demand from abroad is so high, administrators don\u2019t see a need to offer as much tuition assistance.The Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, for example, saw a 30 percent decrease in international applications to its professional master\u2019s program for this semester, according to the dean, Joseph J. Helble. Dr. Helble surveyed more than two dozen engineering deans earlier this year, and three quarters of them said they, too, had seen significant drops in international graduate applications. But enrollment, he said, was not off.Still, trends are not clear.\u201cIf there are one or two more years of comparable 20 to 30 percent decreases in international applications, we\u2019re very concerned about our ability to conduct research and spin off and start companies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned from a competitive perspective.\u201dDan Spaulding, who oversees human resources at Zillow Group, the online real estate company, said that in specialized areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence, his company favors graduate degrees, but for the vast majority of its technical jobs, a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science is adequate. He said he has heard concerns from students and managers about an international chill, but for now the supply of students with computer science skills hasn\u2019t been affected.\u201cA great many of them are coming in with programming skills first and looking to radiate out into other business disciplines, product management, product design,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think going deep academically is not a priority for as many computer science students today.\u201dIn 1994, only about 40 percent of students who were enrolled in computer science Ph.D. programs were from outside the country, according to the Computing Research Association survey.As the economy improved, the percentage of Americans in graduate programs dropped. \u201cGoing to grad school became less of a priority for so many students,\u201d said Stuart Zweben, co-author of the survey and professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University. \u201cYou had to really be interested in research or something special.\u201dThe balance of computer science graduate programs began to tilt toward so-called nonresident aliens in the late 1990s, when well-capitalized dot-coms began scouring for programmers, sometimes encouraging summer interns to drop out of school, Dr. Zweben said.Students from other countries have long seen graduate school as their best path to employment and residency in the United States, and for the industry connections they are not likely to find in their home countries.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to get access from here,\u201d said Ms. Joshi, who is president of the N.Y.U. finance club. She wanted to attend N.Y.U. so she could merge her background in information technology with her interest in the financial industry. She has regular exposure to industry speakers and recruiters.And he would like to see more of them enrolled in the graduate programs. \u201cI feel that\u2019s an imbalance,\u201d he said, \u201cthat absolutely needs to be corrected.\u201dNick Wingfield is a technology correspondent at The Times based in Seattle.Advertisement"}

By the end of the day, sales had hit a new record of $25.3 billion, more than 40 percent higher than sales on Singles Day 2016.Singles Day is now inextricably linked with Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce leviathan that in recent years has turned the holiday into an online \u2014 and occasionally brick-and-mortar \u2014 mercantile extravaganza. It routinely eclipses Amazon\u2019s yearly Prime Day promotional event.In July, Prime Day generated an estimated $1 billion in revenue during its 30-hour sale window, resulting in what Amazon called its \u201cbiggest day ever.\u201dThe event has evolved into a cultural phenomenon.

{"Headline": "Why Companies Like Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Love to Go Bust in Richmond, Va.", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Toys \u201cR\u201d Us world headquarters are on a sprawling wooded campus next to a reservoir in Wayne, N.J., on a street that bears the name of the company\u2019s iconic mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe.Instead, the toy company followed an increasing number of corporations \u2014 from Gymboree to a major coal company to a Pennsylvania fracking company \u2014 that are choosing to file for bankruptcy in Richmond, Va.In recent years, Richmond has become the destination wedding spot for failed companies. The United States Bankruptcy Court there offers several features attractive to the executives, bankers and lawyers trying to get an edge in the proceedings.First, Richmond\u2019s bankruptcy court offers a so-called rocket docket that moves cases along swiftly. Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings can be laborious proceedings that drag on for years. Gymboree\u2019s bankruptcy was completed in less than four months.Second, the legal record in that court district includes precedents favorable to companies, like making it easier to walk away from union contracts.But perhaps one of the biggest draws, according to bankruptcy lawyers and academics, is the hefty rates lawyers are able to charge there. The firm representing Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Kirkland & Ellis, told the judge that its lawyers were charging as much as $1,745 an hour. That is 25 percent more than the average highest rate in 10 of the largest bankruptcies this year, according to an analysis by The New York Times.\u201cThe numbers are stratospheric,\u201d said Kevin Barrett, a lawyer at the firm Bailey Glasser, who represented the State of West Virginia in two coal bankruptcy cases filed in Richmond.Companies can file for bankruptcy in a court district where they have an affiliate \u2014 a loophole that allows them to shop for the court they think will provide the best outcome.For an affiliate to be incorporated in Virginia, it can use a \u201cregistered agent\u201d with a local address, according to the state. For its bankruptcy filing, state records show, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us used a Richmond affiliate whose registered agent has an office in downtown Richmond.Representatives for Kirkland & Ellis and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us declined to comment for this article. So did a spokesman for the federal bankruptcy court in Richmond.It\u2019s not just the lawyers who stand to gain from the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy. The bankers and other professionals who helped arrange $3.1 billion in new debt to keep the company operating in bankruptcy will collect $96 million in fees, according to a court document filed by Toys \u201cR\u201d Us.Executives at bankrupt companies typically agree to the high fees, bankruptcy experts say, because they think the cost will have been worth it if the lawyers and bankers can save their business. Kirkland & Ellis, which has its headquarters in Chicago, has a long track record of getting companies back on their feet in bankruptcy.The two judges in Richmond are also known for their expertise. \u201cThe judges understand the complexities of large corporate bankruptcies and can handle cases expeditiously,\u201d said Dion Hayes, a local bankruptcy lawyer.Still, the huge fees can eat into the money that is left over for small creditors \u2014 typically vendors, suppliers and pensioners.In the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us case, dozens of suppliers of scooters, rubber duckies and teething rings could lose millions in the bankruptcy.Linda Parry Murphy, chief executive of Product Launchers, a distributor for several small toy suppliers, said her clients were owed about $1.2 million from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. She worries that they may recover as little as $120,000.\u201cFor some of these clients it was very devastating,\u201d she said.Nationally, professional fees for bankruptcies have been increasing about 9.5 percent a year, about four times the rate of inflation, according to Lynn LoPucki, a bankruptcy professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.Mr. LoPucki said the higher fees were fueled, in part, by court shopping. Lawyers advising troubled companies tend to gravitate to courts that approve their fees, he said. Judges who balk at high fees see far fewer cases.\u201cThey become pariah courts,\u201d Mr. LoPucki said.Down the road, creditors in the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy can challenge how many hours the lawyers bill at the high rates. Another check on the costs is the United States Trustee Program, which helps oversee the process and can object if the legal bill seems unreasonable.The vast majority of companies \u2014 more than 76 percent \u2014 now file for bankruptcy in a different state from where they are based, Mr. LoPucki said.Delaware and New York \u2014 which have long been popular bankruptcy destinations \u2014 still see the lion\u2019s share of the filings.Then in September, the court landed the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us started out in 1948 as a company that sold cribs and strollers out of the ground floor of a house in Washington, D.C.It expanded into the world\u2019s leading toy retailer with about 2,000 stores and an advertising jingle \u2014 \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Grow Up, I\u2019m a Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Kid\u201d \u2014 that could stick in its customers\u2019 heads like glue.Seeing opportunity in a consolidated toy industry, the private equity investors Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust bought the company in 2005 and loaded it up with debt that today stands at $5.3 billion. It was a burden that proved too much to overcome.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us has dozens of affiliates around the globe employing 64,000 people. But when it came time to file for bankruptcy, the company opted for Richmond, where its law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, had success in the past.The law firm had represented Patriot Coal, a coal miner based in West Virginia that filed for bankruptcy twice in four years, most recently in Richmond in 2015.In that case, the most profitable mines went to another coal company backed by Patriot\u2019s lenders, while the others were closed.Mr. Barrett, the lawyer who represented the State of West Virginia in that case, was stunned by the fees.\u201cI remember five lawyers in one meeting, and I joked that meeting cost $10,000,\u201d he said.This year, Kirkland worked on another bankruptcy case in Richmond \u2014 Gymboree, the children\u2019s clothing retailer, based in San Francisco.Like Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Gymboree was owned by private equity and was weighed down by debt.After emerging from bankruptcy in September, the company closed 350 of its stores across the country, but the retailer is still in business.The Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy case kicked off in September at a packed hearing. Kirkland & Ellis set the stage by playing the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us theme song for the judge.The toy company, the lawyer explained, had tried to turn around its business. But it couldn\u2019t afford to sufficiently spruce up its stores and compete with retailers like Walmart and Amazon because it had billions of dollars in debt. He emphasized how Toys \u201cR\u201d Us had brought joy to many children and how the bankruptcy process would help the company survive.\u201cWe are all Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us kids,\u201d he said.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the status of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us stores after the company filed for bankruptcy. The stores remain open. The company did not close 350 stores.An earlier version of this article misidentified the city where the law firm Kirkland & Ellis is based. It is Chicago, not New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Louis C.K. Is Accused by 5 Women of Sexual Misconduct", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs soon as they sat down in his room, still wrapped in their winter jackets and hats, Louis C.K. asked if he could take out his penis, the women said.They thought it was a joke and laughed it off. \u201cAnd then he really did it,\u201d Ms. Goodman said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cHe proceeded to take all of his clothes off, and get completely naked, and started masturbating.\u201dIn 2003, Abby Schachner called Louis C.K. to invite him to one of her shows, and during the phone conversation, she said, she could hear him masturbating as they spoke. Another comedian, Rebecca Corry, said that while she was appearing with Louis C.K. on a television pilot in 2005, he asked if he could masturbate in front of her. She declined.Now, after years of unsubstantiated rumors about Louis C.K. masturbating in front of associates, women are coming forward to describe what they experienced. Even amid the current burst of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men, the stories about Louis C.K. stand out because he has so few equals in comedy. In the years since the incidents the women describe, he has sold out Madison Square Garden eight times, created an Emmy-winning TV series, and accumulated the clout of a tastemaker and auteur, with the help of a manager who represents some of the biggest names in comedy. And Louis C.K. built a reputation as the unlikely conscience of the comedy scene, by making audiences laugh about hypocrisy \u2014 especially male hypocrisy.After being contacted for an interview this week about the on-the-record accusations of sexual misconduct \u2014 encounters that took place over a decade ago \u2014 Louis C.K.\u2019s publicist, Lewis Kay, said the comedian would not respond. \u201cLouis is not going to answer any questions,\u201d Mr. Kay wrote in an email Tuesday night.For comedians, the professional environment is informal: profanity and raunch that would be far out of line in most workplaces are common, and personal foibles \u2014 the weirder the better \u2014 are routinely mined for material. But Louis C.K.\u2019s behavior was abusive, the women said.\u201cI think the line gets crossed when you take all your clothes off and start masturbating,\u201d Ms. Wolov said.Ms. Corry, a comedian, writer and actress, has long felt haunted by her run-in with Louis C.K. In 2005, she was working as a performer and producer on a television pilot \u2014 a big step in her career \u2014 when Louis C.K., a guest star, approached her as she was walking to the set. \u201cHe leaned close to my face and said, \u2018Can I ask you something?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d Ms. Corry said in a written statement to The New York Times. \u201cHe asked if we could go to my dressing room so he could masturbate in front of me.\u201d Stunned and angry, Ms. Corry said she declined, and pointed out that he had a daughter and a pregnant wife. \u201cHis face got red,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand he told me he had issues.\u201dWord quickly reached the show\u2019s executive producers, Courteney Cox and David Arquette, who both confirmed the incident. \u201cWhat happened to Rebecca on that set was awful,\u201d Ms. Cox said in an email, adding that she felt \u201coutrage and shock.\u201d\u201cMy concern was to create an environment where Rebecca felt safe, protected and heard,\u201d she said. They discussed curtailing the production. Ms. Corry decided to continue with the show.\u201cThings were going well for me,\u201d Ms. Corry said in the statement, \u201cand I had no interest in being the person who shut down a production.\u201dA fifth woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect her family\u2019s privacy because she has not been publicly linked to the incident with Louis C.K., also has disturbing memories about an incident with the comedian. In the late \u201990s, she was working in production at \u201cThe Chris Rock Show\u201d when Louis C.K., a writer and producer there, repeatedly asked her to watch him masturbate, she said. She was in her early 20s and went along with his request, but later questioned his behavior.\u201cIt was something that I knew was wrong,\u201d said the woman, who described sitting in Louis C.K.\u2019s office while he masturbated in his desk chair during a workday, other colleagues just outside the door. \u201cI think the big piece of why I said yes was because of the culture,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe abused his power.\u201d A co-worker at \u201cThe Chris Rock Show,\u201d who also wished to remain anonymous, confirmed that the woman told him about the experience soon after it happened.Ms. Schachner, a writer, illustrator and performer, admired Louis C.K.\u2019s work. They had met in the comedy scene; Ms. Schachner\u2019s former boyfriend was a comedy writer who had worked with Louis C.K. In 2003, when she called Louis C.K. with an invitation to her show, he said he was at work in an office as a writer on the series \u201cCedric the Entertainer Presents,\u201d she recalled.Their conversation quickly moved from the personal \u2014 Louis C.K. had seen photos of her on her boyfriend\u2019s desk, he said, and told her he thought she was cute \u2014 to \u201cunprofessional and inappropriate,\u201d Ms. Schachner said.She said she heard the blinds coming down. Then he slowly started telling her his sexual fantasies, breathing heavily and talking softly. She realized he was masturbating, and was dumbfounded. The call went on for several minutes, even though, Ms. Schachner said, \u201cI definitely wasn\u2019t encouraging it.\u201d But she didn\u2019t know how to end it, either. \u201cYou want to believe it\u2019s not happening,\u201d she said. A friend, Stuart Harris, confirmed that Ms. Schachner had described the call to him in 2003.For years afterward, Ms. Schachner said, she felt angry and betrayed by an artist she looked up to. And she wondered what she could have done differently. \u201cI felt very ashamed,\u201d she said.During Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov\u2019s surreal visit to Louis C.K.\u2019s Aspen hotel room, they said they were holding onto each other, screaming and laughing in shock, as Louis C.K. masturbated in a chair. \u201cWe were paralyzed,\u201d Ms. Goodman said. After he ejaculated on his stomach, they said, they fled. He called after them: \u201cHe was like, \u2018Which one is Dana and which one is Julia?\u2019\u201d Ms. Goodman recalled.Hoping that outrage would build against Louis C.K., and also to shame him, they began telling others about the incident the next day. But many people seemed to recoil, they said. \u201cGuys were backing away from us,\u201d Ms. Wolov said. Barely 24 hours after they left Louis C.K.\u2019s hotel, \u201cwe could already feel the backlash.\u201dSoon after, they said they understood from their managers that Mr. Becky, Louis C.K\u2019s manager, wanted them to stop telling people about their encounter with Louis C.K. Lee Kernis, one of the women\u2019s managers at the time, confirmed on Thursday that he had a conversation in which he told Mr. Becky that Louis C.K.\u2019s behavior toward the women had been offensive. Mr. Kernis also said that Mr. Becky was upset that the women were talking openly about the incident.Mr. Becky denied making any threats toward the women. \u201cI don\u2019t recall the exact specifics of the conversation, but know I never threatened anyone,\u201d he wrote by email on Thursday. Ms. Halpern and Robert Schroeder \u2014 Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov\u2019s agent at the time \u2014 said that the pair told them that they felt they had been warned to stop talking.Mr. Becky arguably wields even more power in comedy than Louis C.K. He represents Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Amy Poehler and other top performers, and his company, 3 Arts, puts together programming deals for nearly every platform.Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov moved to Los Angeles shortly after the Aspen festival, but \u201cwe were coming here with a bunch of enemies,\u201d Ms. Goodman said. Gren Wells, a filmmaker who befriended the comedy duo in 2002, said the incident and the warning, which they told her about soon after Aspen, hung heavily over them both. \u201cThis is something that they were freaked out about,\u201d Ms. Wells said.In the years since, Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov have found some success, but they remained concerned about Mr. Becky and took themselves out of the running for the many projects he was involved in. Though their humor is in line with what he produces, \u201cwe know immediately that we can never even submit our material,\u201d Ms. Wolov said.\u201cSadly, I\u2019ve come to learn that Louis C.K.\u2019s victims are not only real,\u201d she said by email, \u201cbut many are actual friends of mine within the comedy community,\u201d like Ms. Corry, who confided in her, she said.Yet in an interview with The Times in September at the Toronto film festival, where \u201cI Love You, Daddy,\u201d was shown, Louis C.K. dismissed stories of his alleged sexual misconduct as \u201crumors,\u201d and said the notion that the masturbation scenes referred to them never occurred to him. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, I didn\u2019t think of that, \u201d he said.In private, though, he appears to have acknowledged his behavior.In 2009, six years after their phone call, Ms. Schachner received a Facebook message from Louis C.K., apologizing. \u201cLast time I talked to you ended in a sordid fashion,\u201d he wrote in the message, which was reviewed by The Times. \u201cThat was a bad time in my life and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He added that he had seen some of Ms. Schachner\u2019s comedy and thought she was funny. \u201cI remember thinking what a repulsive person I was being by responding the way that I did,\u201d he wrote.Ms. Schachner accepted his apology and told him she forgave him. But the original interaction left her deeply dispirited, she said, and was one of the things that discouraged her from pursuing comedy.The call confounded her, Ms. Corry said: not only had he misremembered the incident, which made her think there were other moments of misconduct, he also implied she had done something to invite his behavior. \u201cIt is unfair he\u2019s put me or anyone else in this position,\u201d Ms. Corry said.Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that with other allegations swirling around the entertainment world, they could no longer stay silent. \u201cBecause of this moment, as gross as it is, we feel compelled to speak,\u201d Ms. Goodman said.Ms. Notaro said she was standing in support of those with the courage \u201cto speak up against such a powerful figure,\u201d she said, \u201cas well as the multitude of women still out there, not quite ready to share their nightmares.\u201dWilliam K.

{"Headline": "\u2018Exposure\u2019 Is About Truth, Sure, but Mostly About Power", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsFor a town so in love with doomsday scenarios, Hollywood has never been big on revelations about itself. That\u2019s what apocalypse is, literally: disclosure of knowledge. In biblical Greek, \u201capokalypsis\u201d means \u201cuncovering\u201d or \u201cunveiling.\u201d It refers to the moment when a long-buried truth is finally exposed. The secret could be anything \u2014 a plague of worms; corruption; a culture of flagrant harassment, exploitation and abuse. What actually ends the world as we know it is the revelation itself, being shown the thing we had agreed not to see. Once we see that civilization had it coming, we can consign everything to the purifying flames.Lately, each day has been a carnival of exposure, as we\u2019ve watched the stones overturned to reveal more and more supposedly great men as criminals, perverts or frauds. Some people are surprised by this, but many are not. In several cases, the big revelation was already old news, the kind of thing we used to call an \u201copen secret\u201d \u2014 something that wasn\u2019t O.K. to acknowledge on the record, lest it come back to bite you. Open secrets are par for the course for women in the workplace; they are the pact we make in order to be able to participate. Why do we do it? Have we all been coerced or threatened? Have we all signed nondisclosure agreements and waivers? Have we all tacitly agreed to participate in this weird hierarchical system, without ever being asked how we like it, to preserve the status quo and the narrative that everything is fine, because familiar narratives are comforting, and exposure is destabilizing, and we\u2019ve been given no choice? Are we brainwashed? Sure. Of course. Some, maybe all, of the above.If the wrong people weren\u2019t so often protected, there would be no need to expose them \u2014 no need to expose what hadn\u2019t been concealed in the first place. In the 2007 documentary \u201cGirl 27,\u201d the writer David Stenn tells the story of an underage dancer named Patricia Douglas who was raped at an MGM stag party by a studio salesman in 1937. When she went public, filing a criminal complaint and suing the studio, she was smeared by the press. She spent the rest of her life in hiding, while the infamous MGM executive, producer and fixer Eddie Mannix is said to have boasted that \u201cwe had her killed.\u201d Women like Douglas were taught that their attempts at exposing the truth would fail and that their lives would be ruined. They were taught to take it or leave it, but mostly they were taught to shut up about it. They were still being taught that more than 70 years later.Exposure is about truth, sure, but it\u2019s mostly about power \u2014 about the relationship of truth to power. When a powerful man exposes himself by forcing his nakedness on others, he\u2019s commanding their attention in a violent way, making them see what they don\u2019t want to see. In the moment of exposure, he\u2019s not the one who feels vulnerable; they are. Conversely, when that man is exposed as a monster, he is shown in a different light. The perspective is forced, and he is revealed to be something else.In the case of the producer Harvey Weinstein, now accused of assault or harassment by more than 80 women, it may be that his victims became more powerful over time. (When you harass seemingly every young actress who crosses your path, it\u2019s inevitable that at least some of them will rise to a position of power.) When it seemed that women might come forward to expose him to the authorities, Weinstein paid informants to gather intelligence on his accusers\u2019 psychological and sexual histories \u2014 the usual scramble to accuse the accuser herself of being a fraud, a gold digger, a disgruntled loser, \u201cdisturbed.\u201d Exposing others is scary because we fear our own exposure; when we say, \u201cSomeone did this to me,\u201d we are asking to be looked at in a new, unpleasant, disempowered way. Who will get the last word? Who will get to delegitimize whom?In Hollywood, as in politics, exposure is something you want coming in but never going out. The fresh face \u2014 say, Mariel Hemingway at the start of her career, hoping for a huge role in Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cManhattan\u201d \u2014 needs exposure. The predatory potentate \u2014 say, Allen himself, when he started dating Mia Farrow\u2019s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn \u2014 does not. What he needs is cover, leverage and all the good will he has banked over the years. He may not even need to withdraw very large amounts. He could get himself elected president, if he wanted. He could do anything. When you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. The comedian Louis C.K., who has copped to masturbating in front of freaked-out colleagues, not only exposed himself but also toyed with artistic self-exposure: He pulled a Raskolnikov, giving himself away in his comedy and in a dangerously self-referential movie. How much could he reveal in public before being exposed? Until recently? Almost everything.The sheer volume of recent exposures \u2014 from what happens between two people in a hotel room to what happens in a huge political campaign \u2014 certainly makes it feel as though we\u2019re living through an apocalyptic moment. It\u2019s elating, or overwhelming, depending on your experience. Allegations ranging from gross harassment to assault have been leveled against Weinstein, against the writer and director James Toback, against the former New Republic editor Leon Wieseltier, against the former NPR and New York Times editor Michael Oreskes, against the former Amazon Studios chief Roy Price, against the journalist and author Mark Halperin, against actors and talent agents, against a senator and a Senate candidate, against \u201cmedia men\u201d listed in a crowdsourced spreadsheet.Countless streams of revelations are coursing everywhere around us \u2014 from the Paradise Papers, which expose the flow of wealthy people\u2019s capital through secret banking channels, to the steady drip of emails and direct messages and surprising meetings uncovered in the Trump-Russia probe. It is, in many ways, exhilarating. It\u2019s as if all the rugs are being lifted, all the demons released.It\u2019s a reminder, once again, that language is power, that storytelling is power, that mythmaking is control. The postwar French critic Roland Barthes was big on exposure, too \u2014 only he was interested in revealing the lies in our most innocuous pop-culture images and \u201ccommon sense\u201d beliefs. \u201cI wanted to expose in the decorative display of what-goes-without-saying the ideological abuse I believed was hidden there,\u201d he wrote. It takes power to expose abuse, and courage. It takes a culture that believes the powerless aren\u2019t exposing for the exposure.In ancient Greece, Pandora\u2019s box was not actually a box but a jar, or a clay pot with a lid, that was kept in the kitchen, where the women were also kept. Maybe it contained evil \u2014 or maybe it just concealed it. Maybe Pandora let the evil out, or maybe she blew the lid off what was really going on back there, where nobody else could see it. Anyway, the truth got out, and all hell broke loose, leaving behind only hope.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft to Expand Campus, as Amazon Looks Elsewhere", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetThe project, which Microsoft plans to announce at its annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday, amounts to a major overhaul of the company\u2019s 500-acre campus in Redmond, Wash., the leafy Seattle suburb that it has called home since 1986.Amazon said it received 238 bids from across North America and is whittling down the list to a group of finalists, with a winner to be announced next year.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said the company did not intend for its hometown expansion \u2014 which he described as a multibillion-dollar investment \u2014 as a comment on Amazon. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re out to make a statement about what anyone else is doing or not doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is the right decision for us.\u201dStill, Mr. Smith could not resist a slight dig. \u201cWhen it comes to headquarters, one is enough, we feel,\u201d he said.Today Microsoft\u2019s Redmond campus has most of the trappings found at the sprawling headquarters of tech giants in Silicon Valley \u2014 the soccer fields, manicured lawns and oceans of parking lots. That will not change on its renovated campus, but Microsoft is taking a different approach in other respects.The new buildings will be clustered closer together. They will also be taller \u2014 four stories instead of the two or three that are common now. There will be a new underground parking facility, a 2-acre open plaza that will serve as a central gathering place and new walking and cycling trails.\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to build a somewhat denser campus and create a somewhat more urban feel,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The company\u2019s decision to stay put at its Redmond campus flies in the face of a trend among technology companies to gravitate closer to cities. The abundance of amenities, night life and public transportation in urban areas has led to thriving tech scenes in San Francisco, New York and other cities.\u201cMy gut reaction is, \u2018Wow, they seem kind of out of touch,\u2019\u201d said Dan Bertolet, a researcher at Sightline Institute, a nonprofit in Seattle focused on sustainability. \u201cAll the young people I know who work in the tech industry out there want to be in Seattle. They pooh-pooh places like Redmond.\u201dTech companies are also finding that the talent they are after increasingly wants to live in cities, not suburbs. That has led suburban giants like Google, Facebook and Apple to operate large private bus services to ferry workers to their headquarters. Microsoft\u2019s own bus service has more than 94 buses and over 4,000 daily riders.But those buses also frequently sit in soul-crushing traffic. Possible relief for Microsoft\u2019s commuters will come in the form of light-rail that will connect it to Seattle. A light-rail station on Microsoft\u2019s campus is scheduled to open by 2023.Had Microsoft decided to move to Seattle rather than remain in the suburbs, the company would likely have faced severe criticism from affordability advocates, who are worried about lower income residents getting pushed out of the city.Mr. Bertolet said suburban areas outside Seattle tend to restrict the density of housing so they\u2019re not likely to develop an urban atmosphere without significant change. \u201cMaybe in the long term,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s better to have a regional network of bigger cities, but getting there will be rough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not the Bots We Were Looking For", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyBut despite the tech industry\u2019s efforts and hopes, the bots that have most effectively lodged themselves in the public\u2019s consciousness over the last year were not here to help \u2014 at least, not us. A different sort of bot \u2014 undercover but public-facing, highly political but comparatively primitive \u2014 was implicated in toxic and disorienting online conversations throughout the 2016 election cycle. Before the election, researchers at Oxford University suggested that between the first and second presidential debates, more than a third of pro-Trump tweets and almost a fifth of pro-Clinton tweets came from bot accounts. Political social bots have been stealing headlines ever since, described variously as \u201cfake Americans,\u201d as \u201cweaponized\u201d and as \u201cfake-news-disseminating\u201d agents of Russia.Such motive-centric descriptions tend to give too much credit to the influence bots. Mostly they are crude imitations of regular, if single-minded, people that, by virtue of existing and posting \u2014 a lot \u2014 are able to manipulate platforms\u2019 shared spaces: They increase visible follower counts and sharing metrics; they create Twitter trends and hijack or pollute hashtags into uselessness; they flood searches around breaking news. They probably don\u2019t follow you, and you probably don\u2019t follow them, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. They find their strength in numbers. They thrive just out of sight but fully within earshot.This type of bot bears little resemblance to the ones demonstrated on the stages of tech campus auditoriums. But each sort of bot is made, in its own way, to exploit untapped opportunity in large-scale automation. Where commercial bot-makers see an almost-too-good-to-be-true chance to simultaneously personify their brands and automate their businesses, political bot-makers see an opportunity to exploit anonymity with a humanlike touch at an inhuman scale. While tech companies stand proudly behind their bots, the people who create prolific and ideological social bots hide behind them. (Their provenance remains murky even today.)But the proximity is toxic, and custody of the word is slipping. Bots, it turns out, make an excellent foil. Angela Merkel, in the run-up to this year\u2019s German federal election, talked about bots, generally, as if they were an invading army. In May, Hillary Clinton pointed to Russia-backed online efforts \u2014 including \u201cthe bots\u201d \u2014 as \u201cjust out of control.\u201d The phrase \u201cnot a bot\u201d now litters the profiles of politically engaged Twitter users (and, presumably, some bots). At the same time, President Trump, or a staff member, has indulged a habit of wandering into Twitter\u2019s uncanny valley to retweet supportive accounts whose humanity is hard to discern, or which eventually and mysteriously just disappear.Social automation is both disruptive and revealing. Twitter in particular dehumanizes users in the process of giving them access to one another, so of course bots could thrive there \u2014 and of course they\u2019d closely resemble our worst-tweeting selves. Voice-and-text-activated assistants help monopolistic companies further consolidate power, and they complicate the stories we tell ourselves about privacy, as we invite the eyes and ears of the world\u2019s most ambitious tech businesses into our most personal spaces. Alexa reminds us what Amazon wants; Twitter bots show us how online mass communication breaks down. What was truly great about Hubot, the cobbled-together, inscrutable, mostly useless chat automaton, was the suggestion it made, through each absurd routine: that online, it\u2019s necessary that we build spaces for ourselves.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poised for West Coast Dominance, Democrats Eye Grand Agenda", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAMMAMISH, Wash. \u2014 It is the stuff of liberal fantasies: a vast, defiant territory, sweeping along the country\u2019s Pacific coastline, governed by Democrats and resisting President Trump at every turn.Sharon Nelson, the Democratic leader in the Washington State Senate, conveyed the party\u2019s grand aspirations in an almost Trump-like phrase: \u201cA blue wall,\u201d Ms. Nelson enthused, \u201cfrom the Canadian border to the Mexican border.\u201dLeading in the polls and anticipating victory, Democrats have sketched an aggressive agenda on issues where strong consensus appears to exist in the party, including new laws on gun control, contraception and environmental regulation. Ms. Nelson said she had met with the speaker of the Oregon Statehouse about enacting policy across state lines. The three states\u2019 Democratic governors have spoken regularly about policy collaboration, and over the summer began coordinated talks on climate change with foreign heads of state.\u201cWe intend to make a full-scale effort in the next session of the Legislature if we win,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a bell in the night, showing hope for the country, rejecting the Trump agenda of denying climate science.\u201d\u201cThe more we can have uniformity in a carbon pricing system or regulatory system, the better,\u201d he said.Both parties see Democrats as favored to win the district, which voted heavily for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Republicans held the area\u2019s State Senate seat largely because of the personal popularity of an incumbent lawmaker, Andy Hill, who died of lung cancer last fall.Despite their dominance at the federal level and in most state capitals, West Coast Republicans have been driven to the point of extinction as the party\u2019s standing has plummeted in prosperous cities and suburbs, from San Diego to Seattle. Their candidate in the State Senate race, Jinyoung Lee Englund, a polished former political operative, has strained to set herself apart from the national party, declaring that she did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 and pleading with voters to embrace divided government in Olympia.Ms. Englund, 33, has campaigned explicitly against the \u201cblue wall\u201d scenario, warning that voters should not let Washington \u201cgo the way of California\u201d and other one-party states. She expressed deep skepticism of Mr. Inslee\u2019s climate proposals and suggested Democrats were mainly focused on trying to raise general revenue by another name. Republican groups have aired commercials saying that \u201cSeattle liberals\u201d could wreak havoc on the state\u2019s finances if Democrats are allowed to govern unchecked.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go the way of Oregon,\u201d Ms. Englund said in an interview. \u201cWashingtonians are more independent.\u201dMs. Englund rebuked Democrats for what she characterized as using the state government as a partisan bludgeon. \u201cI think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThe role of a state senator is not to go and lambaste what\u2019s happening nationally.\u201dMs. Dhingra, 43, a gregarious career prosecutor, has pledged support for an array of Democratic wish-list policies \u2014 though in a nod to the district\u2019s moderate history, her campaign literature promises \u201cindependent leadership.\u201d She has endorsed a carbon tax and applauded the state\u2019s insistent litigation against the White House. Ms. Dhingra said in an interview that state government should take comprehensive action to check \u201cwhat\u2019s coming out of Washington, D.C.\u201d\u201cFrankly, I think all states are going to have to do that,\u201d Ms. Dhingra said. \u201cWe have to make sure immigrants feel safe. We have to make sure women\u2019s health care is protected.\u201dRepublican leaders in the state concede the national backdrop has made a tough race even harder. Rob McKenna, a former state attorney general who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Inslee in 2012, said an upset is possible but called the \u201cTrump factor\u201d a drag on Ms. Englund.Mr. McKenna cautioned that even a Democratic victory should not be overinterpreted as a political turning point. A setback for Republicans, he said, would not change the fundamental character of the state, which he described as more politically competitive and fiscally conservative than its coastal neighbors.\u201cThis is a state that is still, more or less, 50-50,\u201d Mr. McKenna said, predicting of Democrats: \u201cThey\u2019ll have difficulties, because they\u2019ll be reluctant to risk their majorities in the House and the Senate.\u201dOther local leaders are less sure, holding up the Seattle area as an illustrative example of an upwardly mobile metropolitan area shifting to the left. If Republicans have staked their message, in large part, on suburban distrust of the big city, the region is increasingly knitted together by a thriving tech economy at companies like Amazon and Microsoft, and an expanding rapid transit rail network that is tying people closer to Seattle.\u201cThe comical attempts to demonize Seattle in the 45th District race, I think, will be shown to have been a poor strategy,\u201d Mr. Constantine said.The area\u2019s shifting identity has been on vivid display in this election: As Ms. Dhingra went door to door on Wednesday in Duvall, a growing outer suburb built across rolling farmlands, some voters sounded eager to repudiate Republicans. Patty Andrus, a retired paraprofessional in the field of special education, described Ms. Dhingra\u2019s campaign as a corrective to Mr. Trump\u2019s election.With a Democratic takeover in Washington State, she said, \u201cI would stand up taller.\u201dEven some Republican-leaning voters who back Ms. Englund say they are uneasy about Mr. Trump. \u201cShe seems sensible and levelheaded,\u201d Ed Whitehead, the retired owner of a printing company, said of Ms. Englund after she stopped at his door in Sammamish.Mr. Whitehead, who said he voted for Mr. Trump, said these days he is \u201cnot so sure\u201d about the president.Ms. Dhingra suggested that the session might become mainly a chance for Democrats to prove themselves responsible, rather than as a lunge toward California-like status. The Democratic caucus, she noted, is not homogeneous: \u201cYou have rural-area Democrats who have different priorities.\u201dMr. Inslee, too, said Democrats should temper their expectations, even as he made plain his excitement about governing with a freer hand.\u201cThere\u2019s diversity of views in all caucuses, and so nothing\u2019s guaranteed in life,\u201d Mr. Inslee said. \u201cBut what this does is, it takes the shackles off the doors.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the name of a city in Washington where Manka Dhingra canvassed. It is Duvall, not Duval.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Ford Turn Itself Into a Tech Company?", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "Mcity, as the facility is known, was built by the University of Michigan as a testing ground for automakers, including Ford, which has been experimenting with self-driving cars here for about two years. I parked my rental and climbed into the back of a white Ford Fusion with four spinning Lidar sensors on the roof, each roughly the size of a water glass, and a rack of high-performance computers in the trunk. Next to me sat Randy Visintainer, Ford\u2019s director of autonomous vehicle development. Jakob Hoellerbauer, a young Ford engineer, took the driver\u2019s seat. Wayne Williams, a Ford research scientist, sat beside him in the passenger seat typing on a laptop. We put on our seatbelts, and Hoellerbauer hit the ignition and pulled into the road. A beep came from the dashboard, indicating that the car was ready to engage self-driving mode. Hoellerbauer pushed a button on the steering wheel and took his hands away.\u201cWe are now autonomous,\u201d Williams announced.The car glided along Main Street to a four-way stop, waited for another car (driven by a researcher) to clear the intersection, then made a gentle right turn. Autonomous cars are programmed to drive conservatively, and any time our Fusion sensed an approaching object \u2014 like a Ford employee, role-playing an oblivious pedestrian \u2014 it slowed down until it was sure the path was clear, then proceeded cautiously. It felt like being chauffeured by an elderly ghost.Two minutes into the drive, the car pulled around a traffic circle and up to a blinking red light at an empty intersection. It stopped. A few seconds passed. Perhaps, I thought, it was just being characteristically risk-averse. Then a few more seconds passed, and the engineers started to look nervous. Williams squinted at his laptop.\u201cSo right now, we\u2019re not sure if the intersection is clear, so we\u2019re being very cautious,\u201d Williams said, speaking for the car. \u201cIt\u2019s expecting ...\u201d He trailed off and turned to Hoellerbauer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just overtake it?\u201d Hoellerbauer grabbed the wheel and tapped the gas pedal, overriding the self-driving system and manually steering us through the intersection.\u201cWe didn\u2019t see that happen this morning,\u201d Williams explained, by way of an apology. We took another lap around Mcity, and when we reached the intersection again, the car did the exact same thing.Self-driving cars raise the specter of horrific malfunctions \u2014 a code glitch that sends a car careering off a cliff, a remote hack that disables the brakes \u2014 but perfectly innocuous problems like the one we experienced will be far more common, and no less an impediment to road-readiness. There are dozens of autonomous vehicles being tested all over the world \u2014 43 companies are testing 295 different self-driving vehicles in California alone \u2014 and not one of them has a clean record. A self-driving Uber vehicle zoomed through a red light in San Francisco last year. The sensors on cars used by Waymo, the self-driving-car division of Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent, have struggled in heavy rain and snow. I\u2019ve had half a dozen self-driving-car experiences in my life, including a white-knuckle trip down Manhattan\u2019s West Side Highway in a Tesla Model X whose owner had set it to \u201cautopilot\u201d mode, and I wouldn\u2019t describe any of them as relaxing.How quickly these rides will improve depends on whom you ask. Silicon Valley futurists, in typically sanguine fashion, predict that we are months, not years, away from a Cambrian explosion of autonomous cars. Waymo has a pilot program for its self-driving vehicles already underway in Arizona and says it\u2019s \u201creally close\u201d to being fully operational. Lyft, which has partnered with a start-up called Drive.ai, is aiming to have a fleet of self-driving cars operating in the Bay Area by the end of the year. And Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, which has offered semiautonomous features since 2015, has suggested that its cars could be fully autonomous as soon as 2019.But that\u2019s California, where optimism is the coin of the realm. In Detroit, the timeline looks slower and more incremental. Ford, in particular, believes that the first generation of driverless cars will be limited, capable of traveling only in commercial fleets inside carefully plotted urban areas. Other cars will simply get smarter without being autonomous, with features like collision prevention and self-parking becoming more common. Self-driving technology will eventually be more sophisticated and will one day be capable of full door-to-door autonomy in every possible area and condition, but as Ford sees it, that\u2019s not going to happen overnight, or even very soon.Despite its pragmatic restraint, Ford has invested hundreds of millions in self-driving cars and is making surprising progress. In a report earlier this year, Navigant Research placed Ford at the top of its leader board, ahead of tech companies like Waymo and Uber as well as auto rivals like GM and Toyota, based on Ford\u2019s advanced manufacturing capabilities coupled with its strides in software development. The report generated headlines like, \u201cDetroit Is Kicking Silicon Valley\u2019s Ass in the Race to Build Self-Driving Cars,\u201d and delivered a morale boost to Ford, which showed up late but finally felt as if it had a chance.Ford\u2019s big, blinking target is 2021 \u2014 the year it hopes to release a vehicle that meets the Society of Automotive Engineers International\u2019s definition of Level 4 autonomy (no human operator required in the area and conditions it\u2019s programmed for). It\u2019s a tough deadline for a company whose culture might be the exact opposite of Silicon Valley\u2019s, where companies release half-finished \u201cminimum viable products\u201d and abide by maxims like \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d Before Ford \u2014 or any conventional automaker \u2014 produces anything, each part has to pass a grueling battery of tests and certifications. There is a reason \u201cautomotive grade\u201d has become a synonym for \u201creliable.\u201d \u201cOur vehicles have to be a trusted product,\u201d Chris Brewer, Ford\u2019s chief engineer for autonomous vehicles, told me. \u201cThat is a little more important than \u2018Did my phone freeze or not?\u2019\u2009\u201dAmericans are wary of driverless cars \u2014 56 percent, according to the Pew Research Center, would prefer not to ride in one \u2014 and when I talked to Brewer, it occurred to me that some part of that hesitation might stem from who we assume will be producing them: Silicon Valley tech giants, the same stateless behemoths that have spent the last few decades barging into old-line industries like the Kool-Aid Man, destroying working-class jobs and leaving behind cold, modern efficiency. But maybe these skeptics could be persuaded to trust Detroit. After all, Brewer is right \u2014 self-driving cars aren\u2019t smartphones. They\u2019re two-ton projectiles that take your parents to the grocery store and your kids to soccer practice, that will need to make billions of computational decisions per second while moving at 65 miles per hour, that contain within them the power to extinguish human life. You kind of want them to take a while.Leading Ford into this weird new era is Jim Hackett, who was named chief executive in May. Hackett, 62, is an oddity by Detroit standards. A design-minded aesthete in an industry dominated by gearheads and number crunchers, he spent two decades running Steelcase, a Michigan-based office-furniture company whose designers are often credited with \u2014 or blamed for \u2014 popularizing the open-plan office trend.At a conference several years ago, Hackett struck up a conversation with Ford\u2019s executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., who goes by Bill. He is the great-grandson of Henry Ford, and another auto-world misfit \u2014 an outspoken environmentalist who once ruffled feathers at Ford by speaking at a Greenpeace event. The two bonded over their shared vision of \u201csmart mobility,\u201d a fuzzy term, more common among urbanists than businesspeople, for creating a sort of harmony among land use, technology and transportation of all forms. Hackett joined Ford\u2019s board of directors in 2013. In 2016, Bill Ford persuaded Hackett to lead Ford\u2019s newly created smart-mobility unit, and about a year later, he tapped him to run the entire company.Hackett\u2019s jockish C.V. \u2014 he played football at Michigan and briefly ran the school\u2019s athletic department \u2014 masks his high-minded streak, which can make talking to him feel like taking a college philosophy seminar after a few bong rips. In the early 2000s, he began traveling to the Santa Fe Institute, a research group started by prominent scientists who wanted to study \u201ccomplex adaptive systems\u201d \u2014 a branch of theoretical physics that imagines the world as a series of complicated networks that are governed by universal laws and patterns, the same way biology is guided by Darwinian evolution. The rules that explained how anthills formed, they believed, might also explain urbanization trends in Southeast Asia or predict economic cycles. It was a formative experience for Hackett, who began to believe that businesses were governed by universal laws, too.Hackett also became obsessed with \u201cdesign thinking,\u201d a new-agey management philosophy that has become trendy in recent years. Adherents believe that instead of optimizing for profit, organizations should put human emotion at the center of every strategy decision and begin by empathizing with their customers. \u201cNo technology ever evolves without the human interpreting and altering it,\u201d Hackett says. \u201cEvery new technology, the science and the engineering of it, has to give way to human understanding and use.\u201dHackett is only six months into the chief-executive job, but his mannerisms have already entered Ford\u2019s bloodstream. I arrived in Dearborn expecting to talk about drivetrains and crankshafts, but in a series of interviews with nearly a dozen executives, barely anyone mentioned cars or trucks at all. Instead, I heard the Ford Motor Company described as a \u201cmobility solutions provider\u201d that engages in \u201cmultimodal journey planning.\u201d People spoke about \u201cwhiteboarding\u201d and \u201cblue-skying\u201d big ideas. I watched a video that described Ford\u2019s efforts to build a \u201cholistic, organic, interconnected system powered by a transportation operating system.\u201dIt is bizarre to watch an all-American manufacturing company get brain-snatched like this. Even the company\u2019s new internal mission statement bears Hackett\u2019s woolly imprint: \u201cTo become the world\u2019s most trusted mobility company by designing smart vehicles for a smart world.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly \u201cBuilt Ford Tough.\u201d But it\u2019s very much in keeping with Hackett\u2019s worldview, in which everything exists in connection with everything else, and changing one piece of a system necessarily changes the whole. A car learns to drive itself, and a city\u2019s transportation grid shifts around it.This kind of big-picture futurism is necessary in Detroit today, where automakers are frantically reinventing themselves to stay ahead of what they fear might be coming. The average personal vehicle is driven less than an hour per day. But self-driving cars can, in theory, pick up and drop off passengers all day, which significantly reduces the number of cars a community needs. (Researchers at the University of Michigan estimate that autonomous vehicles could cause car ownership to drop by as much as 43 percent. Lyft, which has a horse in the race, cites research estimating that as many as 80 percent of cars could eventually be eliminated.) And because much of the value of self-driving cars lies in the software that runs them, companies that make only hardware \u2014 known in the business as \u201coriginal equipment manufacturers,\u201d or O.E.M.s \u2014 are likely to be squeezed, or worse.Faced with visions of a bleak future as low-margin widget-builders for Silicon Valley, automakers have spent the past several years trying to catch up. General Motors spent $581 million to buy Cruise Automation, a self-driving-technology start-up. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles struck a deal with Waymo, in addition to partnering with BMW and Intel. Daimler and Volvo each joined with Uber, and Toyota set up a whole research institute in Silicon Valley to build its own self-driving vehicles.Ford\u2019s plans might be the most ambitious. It wants to have a hand in every part of the self-driving-car industry, including the software that replaces the human driver, the platform that connects and controls the cars and the services that spring up around them. To that end, Ford has spent the past several years quietly snapping up tech talent. It struck a partnership with Lyft and acquired Chariot, a San Francisco-based start-up that runs group shuttles for commuters. It set up an office in Palo Alto that now has 205 employees and created Greenfield Labs, a business incubator. It invested in Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based artificial-intelligence start-up, and several other companies, including Velodyne, which makes Lidar sensors, and a connected-car software outfit called Autonomic.Most industry observers believe these are the right moves for Ford to be making. But it\u2019s still tough to reconcile today\u2019s Ford \u2014 which makes money by selling millions of combustion-engine trucks and S.U.V.s every year, along with a handful of sedans and hybrids \u2014 with the eco-tech-mobility conglomerate Hackett envisions it becoming. One lesson Hackett learned from his studies is that in order to stay competitive, businesses often have to give up the things that made them great in the first place. (He calls this the \u201cperversity law.\u201d) I asked him if this meant that Ford would need to stop manufacturing conventional, gas-powered vehicles to survive.\u201cWell, part of that statement might be right,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He clarified, sort of: \u201cI\u2019m really just trying to say the better form of problem solving is to abstract the problems.\u201dSo let\u2019s try abstracting Ford\u2019s problems, to see how they might be solved. First: Ford was born at the beginning of a now-outmoded era of industrial production, one that it arguably ushered in. Back then, companies like Ford simply manufactured goods, and customers bought them. Those transactions represented a change of ownership \u2014 a customer who bought a car from Ford was free to install 15-inch subwoofers in it, or paint it bright yellow, or use it in a demolition derby \u2014 and they were typically one-time sales. Ford\u2019s responsibility for the car, and its opportunity to make a profit, ended the minute the warranty ran out.The internet changed that, by allowing companies to wrap physical goods in digital services that can be sold again and again, at much higher margins. Instead of selling servers to corporate I.T. departments, Amazon sells them time shares on a centralized server farm; instead of buying pricey home solar panels, customers can lease them from a solar service, paying for only the power they use. Makers of thermostats, baby monitors and other household gadgets \u201cextend the value chain\u201d by charging customers a monthly fee for information about their home energy use or their babies\u2019 sleep patterns. Even the language these new enterprises use is different. Goods-based businesses spoke in terms of revenues and profits. Service-based businesses count metrics like \u201cchurn,\u201d \u201caverage revenue per user\u201d and \u201clifetime value\u201d \u2014 the total amount of money they can wring from a customer.This phenomenon \u2014 which is sometimes referred to as \u201ceverything as a service,\u201d abbreviated as XaaS and pronounced \u201czass,\u201d among the kinds of people who say these things out loud \u2014 has quietly reshaped the entire economy. Trucking companies that once bought Michelin tires now rent them through a pay-per-mile service. Airlines that buy $15 million jet engines from General Electric can subscribe to OnPoint, a \u201cpower by the hour\u201d program that includes maintenance costs and data-analysis tools. G.E. Aviation now makes the better part of its revenue from services like these.The auto industry was slow to come to grips with this new model \u2014 in part because it long ago gave away the entire service piece of its business to gas stations, body shops, Jiffy Lubes and a hundred other barnacle industries. Thanks to old and byzantine state laws, most carmakers aren\u2019t even allowed to sell or lease directly to their customers \u2014 every transaction has to go through an independent dealer. When it comes to data, automakers are flying blind. As Reilly P. Brennan, a venture capitalist who invests in self-driving technology, put it to me: \u201cThe urinal in the men\u2019s bathroom knows more about its users than most carmakers in 2017.\u201dWith self-driving cars, automakers see a chance to fix that. Ford\u2019s executives talk hopefully about one day offering their own suite of software inside their autonomous vehicles, and building interfaces that companies like Netflix and Skype could plug into. They don\u2019t see themselves usurping Silicon Valley, exactly, but they do see themselves playing in the same league. \u201cTwo to three years ago, the tech community was holding the auto industry at arm\u2019s length,\u201d said Ken Washington, Ford\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cThey thought we were sort of this curious industry that they could come into and disrupt.\u201d He went on: \u201cNow, when I go to Silicon Valley and I interact with tech companies, it\u2019s a dynamic of much more intense interest in collaborating with us.\u201dCollaboration takes many forms, of course, and not all tech companies seem interested in an equal partnership. John Krafcik, the chief executive of Waymo, told me that while traditional auto companies \u201cbring a lot to the party\u201d in terms of hardware expertise, they\u2019re not well equipped to solve the software-based problem of replacing a human driver, which requires huge teams of highly skilled engineers and tremendous amounts of technological infrastructure \u2014 the kinds of tools available to only a Google sibling company. \u201cThe self-driving aspect is really supercomplicated,\u201d Krafcik said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last nine years trying to solve that puzzle. It requires a lot of skills.\u201d It also requires focus, which is a problem for companies that still sell millions of conventional cars and trucks a year, that have thousands of employees to pay and quarterly results to deliver, that can\u2019t exactly drop everything and become software companies.In Detroit, cautious optimism prevails. But outside Detroit, there are real doubts that any auto company can transform itself quickly enough. \u201cAutonomous vehicles are not an incremental shift,\u201d said Carol Reiley, a founder of Drive.ai. \u201cIt\u2019s a very transformative shift, almost like moving from the horse and carriage to the car.\u201d Like many tech executives, Reiley saw Detroit\u2019s quest to control the self-driving-car industry as tactically sound but ultimately a long shot. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they can make it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of baggage.\u201dA week after my Detroit trip, I visited the Pittsburgh offices of Argo AI, the artificial-intelligence start-up that is creating the software brains for Ford\u2019s self-driving vehicles. Ford is investing $1 billion for a majority stake and controls two of Argo\u2019s five board seats. Which means that Argo is an independent company, but only barely \u2014 40 of its 230 employees are transfers from Ford, and Ford is its only corporate partner.Argo\u2019s headquarters is in Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District, a formerly industrial area just outside downtown that has become a center of driverless-car activity. (Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Group is down the street.) Its office is a high-ceilinged space in a modern office building with conference rooms named for famous scientists: Planck, Descartes, Hopper. When I arrived, engineers were eating catered lunch at their standing desks. Squint and ignore the smokestacks outside, and you could be in San Francisco \u2014 which is sort of the point. Ford wants Argo to look and feel like a nimble tech start-up, not a subsidiary of a century-old auto company.I was greeted by Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander, Argo AI\u2019s founders, both well-known figures in the small self-driving-car world. They had been special-faculty members at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s prestigious robotics-engineering program, and Salesky competed in the 2007 Darpa Urban Challenge, a storied self-driving-vehicle race whose alumni now populate the top ranks of the autonomous-vehicle industry. Salesky went to Google to build self-driving cars; Rander went to Uber. They quit their jobs and started Argo AI in November of last year, and in February, with no real product to speak of, and hardly any employees, they announced that they had raised huge sums of money from Ford.The day before my visit, Salesky made waves with a bombastic post on the company\u2019s blog, in which he accused the autonomous-vehicle industry of overselling its progress. \u201cThose who think fully self-driving vehicles will be ubiquitous on city streets months from now or even in a few years,\u201d he wrote, \u201care not well connected to the state of the art or committed to the safe deployment of the technology.\u201d It was a rare role reversal \u2014 the software engineer throwing up caution flags \u2014 and, perhaps, evidence that Ford is trying to stall for time. Officially, Argo is still aiming for Ford\u2019s 2021 target, but Salesky waffled on the firmness of that deadline, saying there\u2019s a chance a true Level 4 autonomous vehicle could be finished later, or possibly sooner. \u201cIt\u2019s ready when it\u2019s ready,\u201d he told me.Salesky freely admitted that he is playing catch-up. Ford won\u2019t share statistics about its self-driving test cars, but public records from California give some sense of what it\u2019s up against. Last year, Ford, which does most of its testing in Michigan and Arizona, logged just 590 autonomous miles in the state, while Waymo\u2019s vehicles logged 635,867 miles. Argo is also building its code from scratch and doesn\u2019t have access to the digital infrastructure that competitors like Waymo and Uber do. \u201cWe\u2019re not out there trying to tell everyone we\u2019re going to be first or beat X, Y or Z company,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cThe goal is to get to market with something that can scale up.\u201dIn order to work properly, a self-driving car also has to understand how humans behave. It needs to know the difference between a car that is idling in the right-hand lane (in which case the autonomous vehicle should steer around it) and one that is about to parallel park (in which case the vehicle should stay in its lane, giving the other car some room). It needs to predict that the jogger running toward the corner will stop for traffic, but that the kid running to chase a basketball might not. It needs to be able to navigate a four-way stop, which in polite parts of the country involves lots of eye contact and you-first hand gestures. \u201cThis goes beyond just seeing and understanding the world,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cIt means understanding what each of the actors in the world is going to do.\u201dIn other words, driving isn\u2019t just a mechanical task \u2014 it\u2019s a social act, and in order to coexist with human drivers, self-driving cars will need to develop a level of social awareness that approaches that of a full-fledged A.I. This is why some computer scientists think Waymo is going to be unbeatable. As an Alphabet company, Waymo has access to some of the best engineering talent in A.I., along with Google\u2019s enormous data troves and the machine-learning systems that have been trained using that data. In other words, the vast data-harvesting powers that make Google\u2019s consumer products so creepy could also make Waymo\u2019s vehicles better at navigating the physical world.But all this obsessive focus on tech elides a much more foundational question about our relationship to cars. Tech companies tend to view driving as a functional problem \u2014 get safely from Point A to Point B as quickly as possible \u2014 in which the vehicle itself is largely an extraneous variable. A car might begin its life as a Toyota or a Hyundai, but once it\u2019s autonomous and on a ride-sharing network, it\u2019s just an Uber. Silicon Valley believes that software, not hardware, is what matters to riders, and this will be especially true of self-driving cars \u2014 which, at least in early days, will most likely be shared among strangers.But Detroit has spent decades and billions of advertising dollars persuading us that its mass-produced cars are anything but homogeneous metal boxes \u2014 that they carry profound talismanic qualities that transfer to their owners. You can be an F-150 woman or a Mustang man, and those choices signal tribal affiliations that extend far past the act of driving. Ford\u2019s challenge, then, is keeping these storied brands alive for the consumers who still obsess over them, while Argo builds the software that will satisfy the car-agnostic city dwellers. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act, made even more complicated by the politics of a 114-year-old Detroit manufacturing company lashing its fate to a one-year-old Pittsburgh tech start-up, and vice versa. \u201cThey\u2019ve put a lot of trust in us,\u201d Salesky said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also put a lot of trust in them.\u201dBill Ford has been working in the family business for 38 years and spent most of that time as an iconoclast. His interest in \u201csmart mobility\u201d \u2014 which amounts to an interest in reducing the number of cars on the road \u2014 was until recently considered heretical. But the past few years have vindicated his predictions. He thinks that the coming convergence of tech and transportation could turn Detroit and Silicon Valley into permanent collaborators. He started Fontinalis Partners, a venture-capital fund outside Ford, to invest in mobility start-ups, and flies regularly to San Francisco to meet with entrepreneurs working on transportation-related projects.\u201cThe narrative, probably even two years ago, would have been \u2018tech companies win, autos lose,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened, though, is there\u2019s been a realization that we have a lot more intellectual property than the world realized,\u201d by which he means celebrated lines like the F-150, along with some proprietary under-the-hood technology that I won\u2019t pretend to understand. \u201cSecond, we really know how to integrate a lot of what the tech companies have into our vehicles, and we know how to make vehicles as well.\u201dI was struck by how frequently this simple point is deployed at Ford: We know how to make stuff, and making stuff isn\u2019t easy. At first, I dismissed it as a na\u00efve attempt to steer a conversation about Detroit\u2019s shortcomings back toward its strengths. Apple taught suppliers halfway across the world how to make iPhones with micron-level precision \u2014 how hard could it be to slap some metal together and put it on wheels?But making cars isn\u2019t like making other things. It\u2019s a dizzying logistical ballet that involves heavy machinery, grueling labor and countless opportunities for error. It\u2019s wrangling union contracts while keeping the line moving. It\u2019s paying people enough to ensure that they won\u2019t miss a loose bolt and kill someone. It\u2019s designing objects that not only work well but also fill a psychological need for buyers. In the end, maybe the self-driving-car race will be decided not purely on technological achievement, but also on these much more prosaic questions \u2014 who can make good things and persuade people to use them? After all, the Model T wasn\u2019t the first car invented, or the best at the time. But it was accessible and functional and spoke to people\u2019s needs in a simple way during a time of confusing technological change. That conversation is about to begin again.Kevin Roose is a business-and-technology columnist for The Times and a writer at large for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Who Is \u2018Harry Clarke,\u2019 and Why Is He So Appealing?", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Harry Clarke humblebrags that the singer Sade is \u201cabout the most real person I know,\u201d you believe him. If anyone\u2019s an expert on real people, he is.That\u2019s because he\u2019s a fake.No, he\u2019s just Philip Brugglestein, Illinois born and Indiana bred and very good at Google. Never been to London, works as a barista. But what a story he has to tell.Among those gifts is the ability to build a performance from various angles at once, as if in a trifold dressing-room mirror. Mr. Crudup plays not only Philip \u2014 and Philip as his alter ego, Harry \u2014 but also dozens of people who pass through their lives. He doesn\u2019t impersonate those people, exactly, but sketches them for us as they might be seen through Harry\u2019s or Philip\u2019s eyes. In other words, he uses the secondary characters to characterize the main ones.In the first part of the play, those supporting characters include sad young Philip\u2019s alcoholic father and overwhelmed mother, both of them bewildered by the emergence of their \u201cpansy\u201d son\u2019s new persona at age 8. (Not many American third graders say \u201cDon\u2019t get your knickers in a twist, darlin\u2019.\u201d) Mr. Crudup gives the father, who is verbally and physically abusive, a flat Midwestern accent that seems all the more brutal in contrast to Philip\u2019s jaunty Brit speak \u2014 and hints at why he adopted it.At other times, especially after Philip moves to New York City and lets the insouciant Harry off the leash, the characters we meet through him are rendered more satirically. (If you don\u2019t know what a Hanukkah Brazilian is, go and learn.) It\u2019s an especially neat trick that in portraying several members of one family \u2014 the wealthy Schmidts, whom Harry infiltrates \u2014 they in turn are portraying him. Their infatuation, based though it is on credulousness, shows us how confident and attractive he\u2019s become.Because we\u2019ve seen where he started, we cannot disapprove too much of Harry as he attains comforts and companionship that Philip never could. One of the best things about the play is that for a long time it leaves us bamboozled into believing, despite the evidence of our senses, that they are different people.The realization that the \u201ctwo\u201d men are actually one \u2014 a realization that they must face as well \u2014 eventually forces us to confront some rather large issues about the construction of identity. If Philip can become Harry just by acting like him, does that not mean Harry was always inside him? Is personality really so multiple and mutable? What about sexuality and morality?These questions keep the play leaping forward, as Harry tests the edges of his fabulous new life. But in the last quarter, when he goes too far, so does Mr. Cale. The minute you feel the action straining toward an existential climax, you start to resist any further manipulation.He needn\u2019t have. Mr. Crudup has a natural sense of drama that needs no underlining. His vulpine charm \u2014 look out for those bright teeth! \u2014 makes it impossible not to like him, even as he grows alarming.Of course, the whole play is set in a theater. One of the meta-delights of \u201cHarry Clarke\u201d is the way it applies the idea of performance to regular life. As Harry proves, we\u2019re all actors, working with whatever rickety materials we\u2019ve got. If only we were all as good at impersonation as he and Mr. Crudup are, we might even be happy.Tickets powered by TicketmastervideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "WeWork Buys Meetup, the Service for Bringing Hobbyists Together", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWeWork has made its name \u2014 and collected billions of dollars from investors \u2014 by providing places for people to work. Now, it is buying a social network meant to bring people together in their off time.WeWork announced on Tuesday that it had bought Meetup, whose 35 million members use the service to find fellow aficionados of some common interest: drone racing, say, or learning Dutch.Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\u201cIt\u2019s like a magical puzzle that fits together,\u201d said Scott Heiferman, the chief executive and a co-founder of Meetup.Meetup members organize on average about 15,000 gatherings a day, according to the company.The event-organizing service has at least broken even over the last few years and has not taken in outside money in years, Mr. Heiferman said. But the company believed that to grow \u2014 and especially to do so abroad \u2014 it needed to bring in investors again.The process of raising money eventually led to conversations about selling Meetup altogether. The company\u2019s general counsel, David Pashman, had a relationship with a senior WeWork executive and suggested the two businesses talk.In August, Mr. Heiferman met with WeWork\u2019s chief executive, Adam Neumann, and the two quickly came to believe that uniting the two companies made sense. WeWork\u2019s roughly 10 million square feet of leased office space, spread out over more than 170 locations in 16 countries, is used primarily during the day. By contrast, meetups happen primarily outside of working hours.WeWork could especially help in promoting Meetup abroad, given its growing overseas presence.Already, roughly 100,000 people have attended a Meetup gathering at a WeWork location, according to the companies.\u201cYou need a proper community space for that,\u201d Mr. Heiferman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a musty church basement or whatever space people used in the old days.\u201dBut Shiva Rajaraman, WeWork\u2019s chief product officer, said that the deal had been done for a bigger reason: to help instill a sense of broader community in the company\u2019s spaces.\u201cIt\u2019s less about utilization and much more about that fundamental mission of connecting people to their purpose,\u201d Mr. Rajaraman said. \u201cThis is a great tool to introduce people to their passions.\u201dMeetup will continue to operate as it has, Mr. Heiferman said. He added that the ideal operating model would be something like how Instagram functions within Facebook, or Zappos within Amazon. (Zappos\u2019s chief executive, Tony Hsieh, is on Meetup\u2019s board.)\u201cWe\u2019re going to be a core part of WeWork,\u201d Mr. Heiferman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really great culture that we\u2019re proud to be a part of.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon, in Hunt for Lower Prices, Recruits Indian Merchants", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "Thousands of Indian sellers have shipped bedding, jewelry, kitchenware and clothing to Amazon warehouses to serve bargain-hunting Americans.Supported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 Americans shopping on Amazon.com this holiday season may find that the best deals for popular gifts like leather shoes and luxury bedding are coming from an unexpected source: Indian merchants.The result is lower prices for consumers because selling foreign goods through the e-commerce giant cuts out some of the usual costs of a traditional importer. But it is also beneficial to Amazon, which gets to add to its enormous product lineup and charge sellers hefty fees.For Indian merchants like Abhishek Middha, founder of The Boho Street, Amazon provides almost turnkey access to the American market.\u201cAmazon handles everything in the U.S., from shipping to customer handling, so we can focus on making the best quality products and adding more products to our catalog,\u201d he said.Although Mr. Middha used to sell on other marketplaces like Etsy, he switched almost entirely to Amazon two years ago because of its vast scale and suite of services. Last year, his sales on Cyber Monday spiked to four times the usual level, helping to propel his annual revenue to $1.9 million. On Black Friday this year, his sales tripled compared with the previous day.\u201cAmazon taught us how to create a brand,\u201d he said.Abhijit Kamra, who heads Amazon\u2019s global selling program in India, said that Americans already buy many products that are made in India, such as cotton towels.\u201cWhat we are trying to do is compress the global supply chain and bring sellers and customers closer,\u201d he said in a phone interview. Some of the 75 million Indian products on the main Amazon.com site, such as saris, tend to attract customers of Indian heritage. But other categories, like jewelry and health products, have wider appeal, Mr. Kamra said.The India program is quite lucrative for Amazon\u2019s bottom line. A merchant who chooses the full array of Amazon services, including buying advertising and contracting with the company to store and deliver the products from Amazon\u2019s American warehouses, typically hands over about one-third of the item\u2019s sale price in fees and commissions.These third-party sellers are crucial to Amazon\u2019s business, said Aaron Cheris, head of the Americas retail practice at Bain, a global management consulting firm. \u201cThey make more money on their third-party stuff than on the stuff they sell themselves,\u201d he said in a phone interview. Amazon says that more than half of the units sold on its shopping sites come from such outside sellers.\u201cI have never seen an R.V.,\u201d said Mr. Murari, a former electronics engineer. But he learned about the specialty sheets from an American company that sells custom mattresses, and then studied images of camper mattresses. Now his factory in Indore, in central India, sells more than 10,000 R.V. bed sets per year in the United States, many of them custom sewn.Mr. Murari said buyers have little interest in camper sheets until June or July, so for the holidays, he is focusing on high thread-count percale sheets for regular beds. Mr. Murari often imitates designs sold by big American retailers, but tried to undercut them on price, selling his versions for about $30 a set, slightly below Target\u2019s prices and less than half of Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s prices for similar items.At the start of the holiday shopping season, Rajlinen had about 42,000 sheet sets sitting in Amazon warehouses across the United States, waiting for orders to come in. Mr. Murari said his profit margin was low and he did not intend to offer big discounts over the weekend or on Cyber Monday, unlike many American retailers. His primary goal was to bring in enough revenue to keep his 115 workers employed.While Amazon.com has sellers hailing from many countries, Mr. Cheris said that India and China are the two most important places for Amazon to recruit new merchants, since both nations are sources of cheap manufactured goods.Unlike China, where local companies dominate e-commerce, India is also a huge domestic market for Amazon. Although most of India\u2019s commerce is conducted offline, Indians are coming onto the internet at a rapid clip through their smartphones. Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, views India and its 1.3 billion residents as vital to his company\u2019s future, and he has vowed to spend at least $5 billion building up his India operations.The Indian merchants selling on Amazon.com find their local site, Amazon.in, to be a less appealing marketplace. With a per-capita income of $1,600 a year, most Indians are unwilling to pay anything close to the prices that sellers can command in the United States.Perhaps that was because Indians know how cheap such spoons are to produce.

But its antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has laid out the principles that would guide that lawsuit when, or if, it is filed.Our colleague Cecilia Kang was on hand for Mr. Delrahim\u2019s speech, delivered at the American Bar Association\u2019s Fall Forum. Here are the parts of the speech she found most important:\u201cLike any regulatory scheme, behavioral remedies require centralized decisions instead of a free market process. They also set static rules devoid of the dynamic realities of the market. With limited information, how can antitrust lawyers hope to write rules that distort competitive incentives just enough to undo the damage done by a merger, for years to come? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m smart enough to do that.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 \u201cIf you\u2019re in the B2C business, if you\u2019re selling anything to any consumer anywhere on the planet, you gotta believe that Amazon is gonna have a look at that opportunity to commoditize you to use scale to serve the public,\u201d Mr. Malone told CNBC\u2019s David Faber during an interview at the Liberty Media annual investor meeting.\u2022 Mr. Malone also said that \u201cit\u2019s way too late\u201d for the cable industry to compete with Netflix. \u201cThe only outfit right now that has a chance of overtaking them would be Amazon.\u201d\u2014 Stephen GrocerHere\u2019s what Emerson is offering now: $135 a share in cash and $90 worth of new Emerson shares for each Rockwell share. The new bid is about 60 percent cash, while the last offer was split evenly between cash and stock.Rockwell shares are up nearly 5 percent, though at $197.51 they remain well below the new offer price, suggesting that investors remain wary a deal will get done. (They\u2019re still at highs unseen in Rockwell\u2019s history.) Emerson\u2019s shares have rebounded Thursday, after initially dropping on news of the offer and now flat.Now that Emerson has raised its offer for a third time, there\u2019s a question about which other levers are available to bring Rockwell to the negotiating table. It can\u2019t seek to unseat Rockwell directors \u2014 the deadline to nominate board members has already passed \u2014 so will Emerson bring its offer directly to shareholders?It isn\u2019t clear what influence the Kochs would have should Meredith prevail, the NYT reports. But Charles and David Koch have been interested in media investments before, having explored a deal for the business now known as Tronc (including the L.A. Times and the Chicago Tribune) four years ago.So it\u2019s possible the Kochs are making a purely economic bet here, and they believe a version of the pitch Time Inc.\u2019s management has been making for years: We\u2019re going to use our declining print business to build a new digital business. (Time Inc.\u2019s digital ad revenues passed $500 million last year \u2014 a number that Time Inc. execs like to compare to BuzzFeed, which did about half of that in the same time frame.)The aim is to reduce the fund\u2019s exposure to a drop in oil and gas prices. These holdings make up 6 percent or about $37 billion of the fund\u2019s benchmark equity index.\u201cWhile the central bank said the view was not based on any prediction of future oil and gas commodity prices or the \u2018sustainability\u2019 of the sector, the move will be closely watched given the fund\u2019s clout in global equity markets.\u201d\u2014 Amie TsangPrevious mishaps have included Yahoo in 2008 overstating the support for its chairman.

Around the same time, a current employee of the same Toronto hedge fund was also flown to London for interviews. The company courting them was fake. Its website was fake. There were no jobs to be had, and the woman who set up the interviews was not a recruiter but an agent working for an Israeli private investigative firm.Advertisement"}

A husband, Joel (Michael Zegen), a businessman and aspiring comic with whom she spends nights out in hepcat Greenwich Village. Well-to-do parents, living in the same building, the better to watch her two adorable kids on said nights out.Midge tears through life like an efficient tornado. She sees perfection as her job, be it throwing the perfect Yom Kippur break-the-fast dinner, stage-managing Joel\u2019s comedy dreams (down to bribing the club booker with homemade brisket) or maintaining her figure \u2014 which she has measured, systematically, every day for 10 years.But the wages of perfection, it turns out, is bupkis. When Joel realizes his talent doesn\u2019t match his ambition, he blames Midge and leaves her for his secretary. (His dalliances, it turns out, are as unoriginal as his act.) She finds herself, despondent and drunk, grabbing the mike on the stage of the Gaslight Caf\u00e9 and unburdening herself with a bitter, risqu\u00e9 monologue.Many of this year\u2019s best TV shows and movies are available to stream right now. Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site, can show you where. Tell us what mood you\u2019re in or what services you subscribe to and we\u2019ll help you out.She kills. Midge, it turns out, can do what Joel did better, in heels and bearing a brisket.And Ms. Brosnahan brings her alive from the opening minutes, a vivacious set-piece in which she gives the toast at her own wedding.The delightful pilot previewed in March, but a funny thing happened on the way to the show\u2019s premiere. The recent sexual-misconduct revelations about Louis C.K. highlighted the problem of comedy as a boys\u2019 club, which Midge\u2019s real-life counterparts Joan Rivers and Phyllis Diller faced.Complicating this issue, Midge finds a kindred spirit in the young Lenny Bruce (Luke Kirby), whose act advanced the idea \u2014 and for some later comics, the excuse \u2014 that the essence of comedy is to risk saying things you\u2019re not supposed to say.\u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d agrees with that philosophy, but adds that not all of those things have to involve masturbation. One of Midge\u2019s most striking riffs tangles with a different taboo: maybe, she suggests, she wasn\u2019t meant to be a mother. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be natural,\u201d she laments, adding, \u201cThe equipment is preinstalled.\u201dMs. Sherman-Palladino spreads the character largess around. Midge finds an unlikely advocate in Susie Myerson (Alex Borstein), a rough-edged comedy manager who sees in her the next Mort Sahl. Midge\u2019s father, Abe Weissman (Tony Shalhoub), is an amusingly huffy patriarch outraged by Joel\u2019s betrayal of his daughter.Joel, meanwhile, emerges as more weak and lost than despicable; he\u2019s a heel, but an Achilles one. The light opera of bickering between Abe and Joel\u2019s father, Moishe (Kevin Pollak), is worth the cover charge alone. In word and deed, \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d is expansive and expressive. It talks with its hands.The early episodes \u2014 Amazon sent four for review \u2014 fall into something of a rut, finding ways to reprise the pilot\u2019s climax by landing Midge in front of a microphone to deliver an unplanned monologue. (In one case, she does standup at a Jane Jacobs rally in Washington Square Park.) But the dynamic suggests a longer arc: can Midge channel her unpredictable eruptions of talent into a polished act \u2014 and thus, an alternative to her not-so-perfect-after-all life \u2014 without losing the passion that drives her?Midge is like a sardonic Hulk; she gets hurt, she gets angry and her superpower bursts forth. Now, she has to learn to control it.Seen in this light, \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d is not simply a period piece. It\u2019s a superhero story. Only this time, the protagonist\u2019s object is not to save the world but to find a place in it: to stand up for herself by doing standup for herself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Walmart Buys Online Retailers, Their Health Benefits Suffer", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe steady growth of e-commerce has been a source of jobs and benefits as employment in traditional stores declines. But at online retailers taken over by Walmart, workers are finding one benefit in retreat: their company-sponsored health coverage.In little more than a year, Walmart has spent nearly $4 billion acquiring e-commerce companies with thousands of workers. Last month, many learned that their potential out-of-pocket costs for medical expenses would increase in 2018 at a rate far exceeding the overall rise in health care costs \u2014 reaching thousands of dollars in many cases.Walmart says the share of its employees eligible for company-sponsored coverage, and of those choosing it, is slightly above the industry norm. But the health benefits it offers in its online operations appear to be inferior to those of many e-commerce competitors.Some of the biggest changes appear to be occurring at another recent acquisition, ModCloth, an online retailer that made its name selling hip, vintage-inspired apparel to millennial women. To keep biweekly premiums for ModCloth\u2019s roughly 300 workers relatively close to what they pay now, their deductibles will rise from nothing to several thousand dollars per year.Some economists say that as Walmart amasses such properties, its practices could put pressure on benefits throughout the e-commerce sector, which had been a relative bright spot for low-wage workers.\u201cMy concern is they bring their model with them regardless of what was going on before they got there,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who served as chief economic adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Blake Jackson, a Walmart spokesman, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve put a lot of thought into creating a total package, including both compensation and benefits, that offers more than what we\u2019ve had in the past.\u201dMr. Jackson pointed out that as new employees of the retail giant, many of the workers had gained benefits like a 401(k) retirement plan with a company match and a stock purchase plan.Mr. Jackson said that the company would make sure its benefits largely kept up with those of competitors, and that the benefits that Walmart offered hourly e-commerce workers were essentially the same benefits it offered hourly workers in its traditional stores.The new Walmart options for hourly workers prominently feature what are known as consumer-driven plans, in which workers cover all their medical expenses out of pocket, up to a relatively high deductible. A medical-expense account to which the company contributes money helps defray these costs.One coverage option for a worker and a child, including dental and vision, has a biweekly premium of about $67 (assuming no use of tobacco products). Walmart would in turn contribute $600 to a health reimbursement account. Once that $600 is exhausted, however, the worker would have to shoulder the full amount of family medical expenses up to $5,500.At companies with 200 or more workers, only 10 percent of those enrolled in such plans face deductibles of $5,000 or higher for family coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s 2017 survey.Larry Levitt, a health insurance expert at the foundation, said that such high-deductible plans had increasingly become the cost-containment strategy of choice among many employers, but that the particulars of Walmart\u2019s plan made it especially ungenerous.At Walmart\u2019s archrival, Amazon, workers typically pay less for more coverage. A similar type of plan would cost an Amazon worker with a child about $60 in biweekly premiums, with Amazon contributing $1,000 into a reimbursement account, according to the company. (The plan includes dental and vision coverage.) After exhausting that account, the worker would pay all expenses out of pocket up to $3,000.If a ModCloth worker with a child wanted to lower the annual deductible to $3,500 \u2014 the lowest the company offers for this type of plan \u2014 and receive a $1,000 company contribution, the biweekly premium would be about $136, or just under $2,000 more per year than the Amazon plan.ModCloth workers were also given the option of sticking with a more conventional insurance plan, but those who do will face premiums that are roughly double their old premiums for family coverage, and their deductible will rise from nothing to $2,000.The average full-time hourly wage at ModCloth is $13.64. (Walmart put the average wage for its full-time store employees at $13.85 per hour.) But ModCloth employees say Susan Gregg Koger and Eric Koger, who started the company when they arrived in Pittsburgh to attend college in 2002 and later married, saw generous health insurance benefits as central to their feminist values. (Ms. Koger declined to comment.)\u201cThe health benefits were really, really good,\u201d said Alicia Faust Ogg, who worked in returns and customer service at ModCloth between 2012 and 2014.Ms. Ogg, who had a baby while at the company, said that she had paid nothing out of pocket for her prenatal visits and that her hospital bill for the delivery had been below $1,000.Under ModCloth\u2019s current insurance, workers pay biweekly premiums ranging from $6.65 for the employee alone to $144 to cover a spouse and children as well. They pay no deductible within the company\u2019s network and a modest co-payment for most doctor visits.But in a tough retail environment, online operations were under pressure even before Walmart\u2019s buying spree.In 2014, ModCloth imposed the first of several rounds of layoffs and, according to several current and former employees, gradually made its perks less generous. That included cutbacks in health coverage, they said, but it remained comprehensive and affordable before the company was sold.Reed Abelson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Said to Have Held Talks to Acquire 21st Century Fox Assets", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Walt Disney Company recently held preliminary talks to buy entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the Fox movie and television studio, the FX cable network and a share of Hulu.The talks were first reported by CNBC on Monday and confirmed by two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private information. The two companies are no longer talking, although discussions could restart.Spokeswomen for both companies declined to comment.The talks, however preliminary, say a lot about the rapidly evolving media industry. Big players like Disney are seeking to get bigger as they follow Netflix into the streaming business and square off against technology giants like AT&T, which is in the final stages of acquiring Time Warner. Medium-size players like 21st Century Fox may be realizing \u2014 or accepting \u2014 that gaining the scale they need to compete may be out of reach at this point.Disney shares climbed 2 percent on Monday. Disney is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.Fox shares shot up 10 percent. Fox is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\u201cWe see the real strategy here as Fox content helping Disney build out its direct-to-consumer strategy,\u201d Steven Cahall, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note.As growth in the traditional cable business slows because of cord cutting, Disney also sees value in Hulu, which focuses on programming aimed at adults, including the Emmy-winning \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d Disney owns 30 percent of Hulu now. Fox also holds a 30 percent share, with the balance owned by Comcast and Time Warner.As part of the talks, Disney also looked at buying Fox\u2019s minority stake in Sky, the Britain-based pay-television service. Fox has been trying to buy all of Sky, but has so far been stymied by regulatory approvals.For 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, such a sale would amount to an acknowledgment that it cannot compete against media colossuses like AT&T and Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal. Companies like Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google are also expanding into entertainment.Mr. Murdoch tried to buy Time Warner in 2014 for $89 billion but dropped the effort after Time Warner spurned the offer.With some of its assets sold, Fox would remain a powerful player in television news and sports, two niches that remain highly valued by advertisers. The talks with Disney did not include the sale of Fox\u2019s broadcasting network, Fox News or Fox\u2019s sports holdings.In its last fiscal year, which ended on June 30, 21st Century Fox had $28.5 billion in revenue, a 4 percent increase from a year earlier, and $2.95 billion in profit attributable to Fox shareholders, a 7 percent increase. Much of that profit came from Fox\u2019s cable television unit, of which Fox News is the largest contributor.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the \u2018Resistance\u2019 Helped Democrats Dominate Virginia", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "FeatureFor campaign managers like Kathryn Sorenson, much of their job was simply channeling the enormous wave of energy that came their way.Supported byEven if she hadn\u2019t broken her neck, she most likely couldn\u2019t have taken even a few hours off work to attend the march: She was the manager, and sole employee, of the two-week-old David Reid for Delegate campaign. Sorenson met Reid on New Year\u2019s Day for a mutual interview; Reid, a well-kept, goateed father of two in his mid-50s, was a latecomer to politics, and was relieved when Sorenson agreed to lead his campaign for the House of Delegates, the 100-member lower chamber of Virginia\u2019s legislature. In her six years out of college, Sorenson had worked continuously on campaigns, all but one of them in Northern Virginia, and despite her youth, she exhibited the grim, sardonic cheer of the veteran operative.Sorenson agreed to work with a novice like Reid because he seemed committed to real issues, and he made a sincere first impression. Also, she liked his odds. Virginia\u2019s 32nd house district is part of Loudoun County, one of the fastest growing counties in the country and, by median income, the wealthiest. Verdant, indistinguishable subdivisions are laid out in self-contained loops between windowed blocks of strip mall and windowless blocks of data center. There are overpasses to nowhere; there are construction sites that look like Caterpillar sales lots as well as actual Caterpillar sales lots. The county and its schools are around 30 percent nonwhite, with a large immigrant population. (Sorenson\u2019s favorite local lunch spot is an Afghan kebab joint.) The 32nd went for Hillary Clinton by 19 points. There was, Sorenson quickly got into the habit of saying, \u201cabsolutely no reason this district has a Republican delegate.\u201dThey had come, she realized, on behalf of what she began to call \u201cthe pop-up groups.\u201d She went to as many of their meetings as she could and found that many of their members were largely unacquainted with politics, especially on the local level. Some of them weren\u2019t even county residents; they were from McLean, and Arlington, and D.C., and even Maryland. Though a majority of these meetings might have been better described as meetings about meetings, she nevertheless admired all these new faces and the vitality they were prepared to bring to what were ordinarily considered marginal down-ballot races.What Sorenson needed from these inchoate volunteer armies, however, was not a collective expression of outrage; it was reliable support for campaign practicalities like door-knocking and phone-banking, tasks that lacked the glamour and solidarity of marches and protests. Even those who could readily speak about state and local issues \u2014 how the Republicans in the House of Delegates had refused the Medicaid expansion and passed a sheaf of anti-abortion bills; how Loudoun County was the only district in Northern Virginia without full-day kindergarten; how somebody needed to put a stoplight at Waxpool and Demott, where Sorenson was almost killed \u2014 were rarely acquainted with the proper channels for action. They would talk about calling their representative, and Sorenson would say, \u201cThat\u2019s not a congressional thing, that\u2019s a state thing!\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s not a state thing, that\u2019s a supervisor thing! Call your supervisor!\u201d Sorenson showed them how to find out who their supervisors were. They wanted to write letters to Terry McAuliffe, the governor, about bathroom discrimination. She said: \u201cDon\u2019t write letters to Terry! The bathroom bill is dead, don\u2019t worry. It died in subcommittee, and even if it hadn\u2019t, Terry had already promised to veto it, so pick a better battle!\u201dTo get Reid on the ballot, Sorenson explained, the campaign needed to collect 125 signatures by March. The pop-up groups were happy to help, especially because Sorenson had a pleasant, easygoing appeal, not to mention a broken neck. Within a few weeks, she was given almost 600 names. She couldn\u2019t quite account for how it was done; these groups didn\u2019t have leadership, exactly, or if they did, they had large \u201csteering committees\u201d \u2014 and they could be touchy if you used the wrong word or gave one individual too much credit \u2014 but they used Facebook and they contacted friends of friends and somehow they got the signatures they needed. And not only that. Representatives from some groups got the required signatures, and then representatives from some other groups materialized to vet those signatures and remove inadvertent out-of-district signatories, and then still other representatives from different or maybe the same groups suggested they might help Sorenson by formatting all of that petition data so they could merge the relevant information with their master voter file. As long as Sorenson was explicit about what she needed, it all seemed to just ... happen.A majority of the pop-up groups were experiments in decentralized organizing, so individual chapters were free to expend their energy where and how they pleased. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia \u2014 and in particular to its 32nd district. Reid\u2019s district had no primary, for one thing, and seemed acutely winnable. It also had Sorenson. She was not only competent; she was, at least outwardly, calm. She also reached out to each group on its own terms, even if that effort alone absorbed three or four hours of each day. And she didn\u2019t want to seem exploitative, so she refused on principle to blast the groups\u2019 lists with what she called \u201chair-on-fire send-$5-now-or-the-world-will-end emails.\u201dThough in theory these groups had diverse goals, the impression they made on Sorenson was one of a great, reverberant longing. \u201cThere\u2019s just this huge energy,\u201d Sorenson told me, \u201cwith people saying, \u2018We want to do something right now, we want to effect change in this election.\u2019\u2009\u201d They were hard to keep track of: who was with which group, what each one cared about, which groups were subgroups or affinity groups of other groups, which had national umbrella organizations and which didn\u2019t, which terms of art groups preferred to describe their particular variety of leaderlessness. There were chapters and huddles and pods, and they used Google Forms or Google Docs or Eventbrites or Meetups. She found herself scrolling through endless Facebook commentaries in search of group moderators or other sources of provisional authority.She began to build her own Google Doc as a central storehouse for all the fugitive information. This color-coded document included but was not limited to, in no particular order, the following groups: 31st Street Swing Left; Code Blue; Indivisible Del Ray; Indivisible VA Assembly 42; Network NoVA; NOVANation Coalition; Sister District DC; Sister District Maryland; Swing Left; Together We Will NoVA; Vienna Neighbors United; VOTE MOB VA; WofA (We of Action); ACT Empowered; We ARE the People Who Stand Up; Loudoun 4 Women\u2019s March on Washington; Hunter Mill Huddle; Arlington Huddle Action Network; Neighbors for a Blue Virginia; Ward 3 Democrats; the Resurgent Left; Turn It Blue DC (formerly Swing Left NE DC); Dining for Democracy; #Citizen. Sorenson got a kick out of the names the groups had given themselves. She loved one called the Huddlery.Sorenson\u2019s list included the names of the principals, to which she often felt obligated to append the qualification \u201c(co-leader?)\u201d or \u201c(steering committee member?).\u201d She documented their purpose, insofar as she could divine it; her perception of their viability (\u201call talk no plans\u201d); and their willingness to help the Reid campaign to, as her own hashtag put it, #flip32blue. Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way. Some, like Flippable, had former campaign people on staff; they just needed to hear the numbers and they\u2019d mail a check. Others, like the West L.A. Democratic Club, asked her questions for an hour before saying no. Some had clear purity tests \u2014 \u201cWill you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?\u201d \u201cWere you endorsed by Senator Sanders?\u201d \u2014 and Sorenson\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t always check all the boxes. Others were concerned that she didn\u2019t need the help badly enough.Sorenson did her best to put her candidate and their campaign up for adoption in a way that made their specific requirements clear. It was going to be expensive, for one thing. They had to raise at least $400,000, or $500,000 if she wanted her \u201cCadillac plan.\u201d The map of Loudoun County is a Mandelbrot set of nested subdivisions, and three of her precincts \u2014 the Villas, Lansdowne Woods and the Ashby Ponds retirement community \u2014 are gated and thus \u201cunknockable,\u201d which meant the campaign would have to double down on phone banking. This would require a lot of coordination. Running against a seven-year incumbent, Reid also faced a huge deficit in name recognition, which meant that early preparatory canvassing was just as important as a late turnout effort.Money and time would always be the hardest asks, but while Sorenson was still neck-braced and understaffed, there were plenty of basic start-up tasks to complete. One outfit offered to make the campaign an easily updatable website. Another sent a member to take photographs, which saved the campaign $700. Sorenson offhandedly mentioned that it would be nice to have a spreadsheet itemizing all of Tag Greason\u2019s votes in his seven years in the House of Delegates \u2014 bill number, how he voted, why it matters. She had it within hours. Yet another organization delivered print-at-home postcards that recalled classic Americana, marked with parks and schools and polling places; she wanted people to keep in mind that the 32nd district was an actual place. She loved the postcards, even if she had to send repeated reminders about which disclosures were necessary to make them compliant with campaign-finance law.It wasn\u2019t lost on her that some of the work being done was redundant, and that some of her interactions required more effort than they ultimately returned, but Sorenson understood that the new spirits were fragile. She tried to remind herself that each group brought its own perspective or talent, even as her attempt to outline their special characteristics revealed a litany of special needs. One group was part of a Jewish organization and thus couldn\u2019t canvass on Saturdays. Another one wanted to know how to get over to Loudoun without paying tolls, and many of its members were older and needed printed directions or car pools. But Sorenson\u2019s willingness to keep track of and accommodate all these preferences gave her word-of-mouth fame. No research trial \u2014 volunteer-coordination software, fund-raising by text message \u2014 was too small or bug-ridden for her to disdain, and she joked that she was first in every line to serve as a guinea pig.In June, Shaun Daniels, then an executive director of an influential PAC called Win Virginia, told me, \u201cNo one anywhere is working with more outside groups than Kathryn.\u201d Democratic politics had entered a new era of experimentation, he said, and \u201cthis here is ground zero.\u201dThe other salient election was the recent runoff between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. Sorenson herself was not disposed to draw any big lessons from Ossoff\u2019s defeat, which she was by nature unable to regard as a leading indicator on the president, or the Democratic Party, or the role of outside patrons. It seemed to her that the campaign was waged about as well as it could have been in a district that was close to impossible for a Democrat to win. For many of her volunteers, however, the loss felt like a dispiriting prelude to what was supposed to be a stirring campaign kickoff.Early in the morning, a crowd of campaign staff members, longstanding volunteers and outside irregulars milled around Reid\u2019s home in anticipation of their canvassing shifts. The family\u2019s two shiba inus were underfoot, the coffee table was decorated with back issues of astronomy and archaeology magazines and the whole place smelled faintly but persistently of maple syrup. There were cars from Massachusetts and Missouri, and Reid joked more than once about how he kept meaning to give out an award for the person who traveled the farthest to be there. The volunteers were mostly women, and mostly middle-aged, and had come outfitted for day hikes of moderate exertion. Whenever one of them was asked which group, if any, she had come with, there was a perceptible pause as she thought about the profusion of mailers in her inbox and posts in her Facebook feed.Those there for the first time were nervous about how they would be greeted. A woman from Vienna, Va., named Francesca, in capri-length cargo pants, sturdy boots and a beaded necklace, raised her hand. She had come on behalf of half a dozen groups. \u201cAm I going to look like a carpetbagger, or should I say that I care so much that I came here from elsewhere?\u201dReid looked to Sorenson before responding. \u201cNobody will ask you because you look like the district \u2014 it\u2019s pretty diverse here. We joke that we give an award for the person who came the furthest. All of this, here, it\u2019s really starting to make a difference.\u201d The volunteers were shuffled through a brief orientation, which was longer on Reid\u2019s biography \u2014 a foster child who was the first in his family to go to college; a local businessman who sent his daughters to the public schools; a retired Navy Reserve intelligence officer who gave 23 years of service to his country \u2014 than it was on his positions. But the point of the summer canvass was deliberately introductory.Francesca, the woman from Vienna, cleared a space for me in her cluttered minivan. She\u2019d worked on clean-energy policy, she told me en route, but her entire department was recently eliminated. We passed a new data center across from a data center under construction. She delivered an impassioned monologue as she tried to pay attention to the GPS; she had an air of spiky distraction, as if stopping to scowl at news alerts while watching a TV show. \u201cNow the Klan is out in Charlottesville when they take down the Confederate monuments. Just the other day I went to the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center for the first time in my life. It\u2019s intersectionality. If affluent people like me aren\u2019t caring about Black Lives Matter, well \u2014 it kind of opened my eyes. We can\u2019t ever not be engaged again. It\u2019s like the Founding Fathers\u2019 idea of the yeoman government. My progressive friends, they\u2019re on Facebook but they\u2019re not out canvassing and phone-banking. There\u2019s nothing else going on in \u201917, and there\u2019s all this pent-up energy.\u201dFrancesca said she had gone to the Women\u2019s Summit the previous morning and left exhilarated, but what she took away from the conference wasn\u2019t wholly clear. Each delegate emphasized the importance of gerrymandering, and health care, and school funding, and rural broadband, and the state of the roads. If the national Democratic Party really was in crisis, torn between cultural politics and pocketbook issues, it certainly wasn\u2019t visible at the summit. The biggest applause line of the day came from Danica Roem, a transgender former journalist and \u201cfreshman member of the Democratic Party\u201d who won a surprise victory in a four-way primary in District 13, to the south. \u201cMy opponent,\u201d she said with national-stage charisma, \u201ccares more about where I go to the bathroom than how you get to work!\u201d Francesca, however, seemed to have little interest in low-stakes issues like the office vacancies on Manassas Drive. \u201cWe\u2019re literally fighting for our democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u2019\u2009\u201dWe got out to canvass in a subdivision of modest flagpoled homes on branching cul-de-sacs. Francesca traipsed over people\u2019s lawns and rapped hard on doors. The hit rate with canvassing is always low, and over two hours on a hot and cloudless Sunday, we encountered only half a dozen families at home.In the few conversations Francesca did have, she was invariably friendly and polite, but her pitch about Reid was mostly that he was a great guy; every once in a while she remembered to say that he was in favor of full-day kindergarten districtwide or distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. In her one extended interaction, a young mother began by saying that her family cared above all about full-day kindergarten. She had only ever voted in presidential elections, she admitted, but then managed, over the course of five minutes, to convince herself that she was wrong to do so.\u201cI don\u2019t vote in the local but I guess I really need to now,\u201d she said.\u201cWell, I was never out canvassing before, either!\u201d Francesca said.Some volunteers I accompanied were more careful to stay off lawns, or more fluent in the local issues, or had greater experience with the mechanics of political campaigns; some remembered that a \u201c1\u201d on the voter-information sheet meant most likely to vote for David Reid, while others were sure that great enthusiasm was recorded with a \u201c5.\u201d On the record, they were always positive about their huddles and steering committees, even if off the record they wondered whether the welter of organizations meant duplicative or otherwise-inefficient resource allocation. No one, however, seemed frustrated by the fact that they reached only a handful of voters, or discouraged from making a return trip.By the end of the weekend, more than 40 volunteers had knocked on more than 2,500 doors. Sorenson rarely allowed herself to be thrilled by anything, but she conceded some satisfaction that these were patently terrific results. This wasn\u2019t to say that everything had gone smoothly. When canvassing was over, Sorenson checked the campaign\u2019s email account to find a restrained but irate message from a community member, upset that his home\u2019s \u201cno soliciting\u201d sign was ignored. The volunteer stood and argued about the First Amendment. The voter leaned Republican, he continued, but had always voted on both sides of the aisle, and from what he knew about David Reid, he was interested. This encounter, however, had cost them his vote.This didn\u2019t sound to Sorenson like one of her own people. She looked up the planned itineraries of one of the outside groups \u2014 an organization dedicated to voter-suppression issues \u2014 and found that it must have been someone from its camp. Sorenson wasn\u2019t sure there was much she could do. \u201cThey have a different list, and a different script, and different priorities. We tell our people in training not to get into constitutional battles, but each group does its own thing.\u201dThe major development was an unexpected shift in the dynamics at the top of the ticket. The governor and the state\u2019s two senators were Democrats; the pipe dream for November 2017 was to bring the State Legislature into line. In August, however, the Republican gubernatorial candidate \u2014 a former lobbyist, R.N.C. chairman and all-around establishment figure named Ed Gillespie \u2014 hired an erstwhile Trump campaign operative and reinvented himself in the president\u2019s image. He began to speak out against the removal of Confederate monuments and in favor of the travel ban. He spoke about the danger of \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d even though Virginia has none, and ran campaign ads about Latino gang violence that prompted a rare public rebuke from Obama.It was hard to tell how this affected Sorenson\u2019s race, though the summer poll wasn\u2019t good; Reid was down by seven. But the race, Sorenson knew, was always going to come down to turnout. The weekend after Labor Day would hopefully set the tone for the fall, when, with any luck, the name recognition they\u2019d worked to foster might begin to translate into voter commitments. When returning summer volunteers arrived, they found a more mature operation: there was a sign-in table in the entryway, three times the turnout and a campaign staff large enough for one person to do check in, one person to divide the turf and a third to guide the orientations.Reid as a candidate seemed looser and more confident. He\u2019d received recent endorsements from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, and was willing to talk about more difficult subjects. \u201cThere\u2019s some hesitation among people of color to put up yard signs\u201d for a Democrat, he told a group of volunteers, \u201cafter what we\u2019ve seen, down in Charlottesville and elsewhere, with the emboldening of white supremacists.\u201d He did not seem like the sort of person who\u2019d ever had reason to refer to white supremacy. He was, however, still making the same joke about giving an award to whoever had traveled the farthest to volunteer.For every volunteer who saw fit to challenge the campaign\u2019s authority or its expertise, however, there were half a dozen there for a political education. If everybody hated the tolls, more than one canvasser asked, why were they so high? Well, the campaign answered, the Australian firm that owned the Dulles Greenway had donated $8,000 to Delegate Greason. There was something about the modesty of that figure that got even distant volunteers incensed on behalf of the local community. The conflicts surrounding Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel and the emoluments clause were exasperating but remote in their immensity, whereas a $6 toll for a $2.29 bottle of milk was an affront you could grasp.With 11 days to go before the election, their ground strategy shifted from the voter-commitment stage to the final get-out-the-vote effort; on the campaign\u2019s final Saturday, they enlisted 205 volunteers to go door to door helping voters articulate an explicit plan for when and how they\u2019d go to the polls on Tuesday. The race, as Sorenson predicted, was going to come down to turnout on the margins: their tracking poll had them in a dead heat. Sorenson\u2019s estimate was that Reid needed 13,150 votes to win, and it was easy for her to imagine that the final tallies would be within the 1 percent margin that would trigger an automatic recount. With the race tightening, Greason sent mailers that described Reid as a radical leftist who had taken \u201ctens of thousands of dollars from New York, Washington and California.\u201d Sorenson showed it to me and shrugged. \u201cWell, that last part\u2019s true.\u201dSorenson was grateful for all the money and help from her outside volunteers, but what most moved her was when she felt someone had made the organizational leap from political fury to political identification. When one of her Sister District captains in Maryland asked for a yard sign, Sorenson furrowed her brow and asked her why she wanted one on the other side of the river. The volunteer simply said, \u201cWe need to expand what we think of as our own backyard.\u201d Sorenson didn\u2019t have a lot of time for mawkishness, but that idea, she said, \u201cis just beautiful to me.\u201d And she could appreciate whatever it was that got people newly involved in politics and kept them there. If Indivisible wanted to call Virginia \u201cthe first statewide referendum on Trump,\u201d that was fine with her, as long as they didn\u2019t set expectations so high that their support couldn\u2019t survive a disappointment.The foot traffic \u2014 not just the usual folks from D.C. or Maryland, but people who came from California, Florida and Iowa \u2014 was so steady that the campaign began to run out of clipboards. Volunteers would arrive, muddy and soaked, peel off their clear ponchos and hand over their unreadably macerated voter rolls. By midafternoon, they were almost finished with the fifth complete pass they\u2019d done, over their 11-day \u201cmobilization window,\u201d of all 10,000 doors in their universe. Most returnees declared that everyone on their lists had either voted already or was just waiting for a spouse to come watch the kids; some of them stopped Sorenson to tell her stories about how they took a moment at the end of their shifts to circle back around and check on these promissory replies, and more often than not they encountered \u201cI voted\u201d stickers. Then they\u2019d be handed a new packet and sent back out into the rain. Someone in need of reprieve asked Sorenson when she planned to wrap things up for the day. \u201cWhen do you stop? If your nearest polling place closes at 7:00 and is two minutes away, you stop at 6:58.\u201dSorenson didn\u2019t feel she could really trust the numbers that were coming in \u2014 turnout, she thought, couldn\u2019t realistically be as high as it seemed to be \u2014 but by 4 o\u2019clock she could no longer ignore the fact that most polling places had already far exceeded the totals they usually showed in off years. She dealt with her mounting anxiety by making new spreadsheets to compare precinct-level historical data and devoted her last hour of her campaign\u2019s last day to one final round of phone-banking to voters in what she worried was her one underperforming precinct.The campaign party was at a favorite strip-mall wine bar. Sorenson went home to change, thinking she might have a moment to herself before the results came in, but by the time she and the rest of her team arrived, 90 percent of Loudoun\u2019s precincts were reporting. Reid\u2019s race was one of the first calls. He won with more than 17,000 votes, by at least 17 points. Shoals of well-wishers formed around Sorenson, touching her arms and shoulders and yelling through their tears. \u201cYou are so [expletive] awesome,\u201c one said. \u201cYou brought happiness back into our lives,\u201d said another.Sorenson made her way through the crowd slowly and with only a small, hesitant, curious smile. Every few minutes the growing crowd reacted to new results. Wins at the top of the ticket brought sighs of relief, but the shouted announcement of each successive delegate victory triggered gasps and whoops of astonishment: the first Asian-American woman, the first two Latina women, the first out lesbian, the first trans woman, an African-American woman, even a woman in a Trump district; altogether at least 11 new Democratic women, seven from Northern Virginia alone, in a swell that seemed likely to result in 16 flipped districts for a tied House. Eventually Sorenson sat down with her finance and field directors \u2014 the three young women, Reid later proclaimed, who organized a legion of volunteers and brought them to victory \u2014 to eat some cheese; she particularly liked the kind of Brie they had there, which is why they chose the venue for the party. She stopped to read a congratulatory text from \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s guy.\u201dHer finance director looked over at her and asked, through a flood of tears: \u201cHow are you so calm? I feel like we\u2019ve all been in our little bubble, but look\u201d \u2014 she gestured toward the television overhead \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re on MSNBC! How are you not crying?\u201dSorenson just smiled her smile of mellow detachment, and finally spoke. \u201cI just kind of want to throw my phone into the ocean.\u201dGideon Lewis-Kraus is a writer at large for the magazine.

{"Headline": "Dinosaurs Might Not Be Extinct Had the Asteroid Struck Elsewhere", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesOther researchers questioned their findings.When the asteroid, which had a diameter about half the length of Manhattan, struck the coast of Mexico, it found a rich source of sulfur and hydrocarbons, or organic deposits like fossil fuels, according to the researchers. Scorching hot temperatures at the impact crater would have ignited the fuel. The combustion would have spewed soot and sulfur into the stratosphere in sufficient quantities to blot out the sun and change the climate, setting into motion the collapse of entire ecosystems and the extinction of three-quarters of all species on Earth.The Chicxulub impact spewed an extraordinary amount of black carbon, or soot, from the rocks, the researchers said. That in turn launched nearly 60 Hoover Dams worth of soot into the upper atmosphere, cooling the Earth\u2019s surface by as much as 18 degrees Fahrenheit, they said.Not every place on the planet has the same amount of fossil fuel reserves and sulfur trapped beneath its surface. Locations with less hydrocarbons would have jetted less soot into the sky upon impact and created a smaller cooling effect around the globe. So Dr. Kaiho set out to determine the mass extinction hot spots in the Mesozoic real estate market.He created a map of what the world looked like 66 million years ago and used present day measurements of sedimentary rocks and organic compounds to estimate the global distribution of hydrocarbons during that time.Scientists not involved with the paper criticized the underlying research.Scientists agree that the planet was blanketed by soot after the impact, but they argue over how it got there. Dr. Gulick said the asteroid impact most likely hurled fiery debris into the sky, which then rained down and ignited firestorms around the world within hours of the crash. The wildfires, he contends, not the burning fossil fuels at the impact site, were what released immense amounts of soot into the stratosphere.Dr. Kaiho responded to the criticism by saying that his previous soot analysis indicated that it had burned at a higher temperature than what is seen in soot from forest fires and that it all most likely came from the same source, which he said were the rocks at the Chicxulub asteroid impact site.Advertisement"}

Early on, it was just her and her son Kyle, now 23, waiting in line for discounts (and, sometimes, free toy penguins) at the local Mervyn\u2019s. Now, it has become a family tradition, and her three other sons and her husband, Dave Gammell, sometimes tag along.The holiday weekend is the busiest shopping period of the year, with an estimated 164 million people \u2014 69 percent of Americans \u2014 expected to hunt for deals, according to the National Retail Federation trade group.This week, the Gammells, who live in Southern California, began visiting stores on Thanksgiving as more businesses stayed open to generate more sales. Here\u2019s a chronicle of their journey through two big holiday shopping days.At home in Torrance, the family prepares for its annual Thanksgiving dinner at King\u2019s Hawaiian Bakery & Restaurant. Jennifer gathers Black Friday ads from retailers, checks the lists the family has compiled, and packs a change of clothes and a pair of sneakers for the shopping trip after dinner.The Gammells, lightly dressed for the balmy weather, arrive at the restaurant. They load up on turkey, vegetables, rice and sweets at the buffet.Their first shopping destination is Target. The store opened earlier in the afternoon, and the post-dinner crowd checks out the merchandise at a leisurely pace. Kurt Gammell, 8, bounds through the aisles looking for Nerf guns and Legos.Waiting in line, bleary-eyed and bored, can be \u201ctorturous,\u201d said Jennifer, who works as an administrative assistant. So the family no longer bides its time outside stores for three or four hours, instead arriving an hour before the doors open or half an hour after, once the crowds have cleared.Jennifer and her son Bryce, 16, compare the prices of items in Target to similar products online.Amazon is expected to account for up to 8 percent of holiday retail sales, according to Bain.As a result, Mrs. Gammell\u2019s Black Friday timeline has shifted.\u201cI\u2019ve actually already started shopping online,\u201d she said, days before Thanksgiving. \u201cThe tradition is changing.\u201dThe expedition to Target was a mild success. The Gammells scored some good deals on toys and games but missed other discounts they had been considering.They loaded their purchases into the family van and maneuvered out of the busy parking lot.Next up: Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. Kurt is on the hunt for board games and \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d play sets. The family is hoping to get some gifts for the extended family. Dave, a lifelong collector of Hot Wheels toy cars, is temporarily sidetracked, admiring a new model based on a vehicle from the film \u201cThe Godfather.\u201dThe Gammells buy the toy car. And a Lego set. And some Lego Dimensions video game packs. And some doll clothes and science fiction figurines.Best Buy is the family\u2019s last stop for the night. They enter hoping to find a new refrigerator, but decide to hold off on the purchase. At times, it feels like they have the store to themselves.The Gammells stumble home, unload their purchases and then head to bed.Dave and Jennifer haul themselves out of bed for their second go at holiday shopping. Bryce resists the early wake-up call, telling himself that he will look for deals online later. Kurt has to be coaxed out of his slumber.On the way to Kohl\u2019s, Jennifer checks the store\u2019s ad for discounts on a new refrigerator. The family has wanted an upgrade on their old, inefficient appliance for a while now. Seeing nothing appealing in the circular, the family decides instead to purchase a Samsung refrigerator online from homedepot.com, where they spend $998 instead of the full $1,774 price.Expecting packed aisles at Kohl\u2019s, the Gammells arrive to find a sparsely populated store. Kurt persuades his parents to buy him yet another Nerf gun for $19.99.The family is almost ready to call it a day. First, they stop at the Starbucks cafe inside a Barnes & Noble bookstore, which is offering free coffee as a Black Friday perk.Satisfied with their shopping, the Gammells arrive home, where their living room is lined with bags of toys, clothing and electronics. They head out to a party for one of Kurt\u2019s friends. In total, over Thanksgiving and Black Friday, the family spent $1,750.Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

{"Headline": "Dealers\u2019 Online Sales Continue to Challenge Watch Brands", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWatch brands use the term \u201cgray market\u201d to describe genuine products sold through an unauthorized source, usually an online retail site. Mr. Grant says he resents the term because it implies \u2014 incorrectly, he says \u2014 that the independent websites are somehow not professional.\u201cIt makes it sound as though there must be something wrong,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from his office in Moorpark, Calif., near Los Angeles. \u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201dSome gray merchants buy watches at a discount from authorized dealers, often through middlemen, and resell them to consumers for less than the brands\u2019 official retail prices. Others buy watches in one country, sometimes at full retail value, and sell them in another, profiting off asymmetries in currency conversions or brands\u2019 global pricing strategies.Few watch brands invest in search-engine marketing, allowing gray sites to dominate online sales, the L2 report said. Others do not list prices online, it added, allowing gray sites to \u201cintercept frustrated shoppers.\u201dMr. Randall said: \u201cCompanies that show their brands and don\u2019t put prices on them: What are you, not in business?\u201dThe L2 report said gray sites sell genuine products for average discounts of 28 percent to 49 percent off retail prices, and that savings typically are largest for watches worth $1,000 to $5,000 and $5,000 to $10,000, including models by popular brands like Rolex and Omega. It identified the four major gray sites as Chrono24, based in Germany; Jomashop and Ashford, both based in New York, and AuthenticWatches.Mr. Randall, who said his company was not among the gray market\u2019s primary sites, said that it still would earn about $8.5 million to $9 million in revenue this year, with a 7 percent profit margin.LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which owns watch brands such as Tag Heuer, Zenith and Hublot, declined to comment on the market, as did Cartier and Rolex. Breitling did not respond to emails seeking comment.\u201cOne of Omega\u2019s great strengths is the customer experience that is guaranteed through the brand\u2019s own official channels,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly here will you gain the full value of a complete range of products, a professional and knowledgeable boutique service and, above all, the absolute assurance of authenticity.\u201dMr. Grant said some prospective clients still fear buying a fake watch online but that such concerns have faded over the last decade as AuthenticWatches.com has built its reputation, in part by gaining authorization to sell through Amazon Prime and other online sales channels.\u201cThat\u2019s a key to establishing consumer comfort,\u201d he said.A common customer complaint about gray market sites is that their watches do not come with the brand warranties, the repair and support pledges that are a hallmark of many top-end Swiss makers. But Mr. Grant said his site offers a warranty that he described as sometimes better and sometimes worse than brands provide.\u201cIt all pretty much balances out,\u201d he said.Watch brands appear to perceive gray-market businesses as adversaries \u2014 even if some dealers maintain that brands quietly appreciate how their sites help to offload inventory.Also, Tag Heuer\u2019s chief executive, Jean-Claude Biver, said in an April letter to the company\u2019s authorized dealers that the watchmaker was \u201ctaking aggressive action\u201d: A planned 2 million Swiss franc buyback of watches this year from what he called \u201cunauthorized\u201d stores, websites and dealers.\u201cTAG Heuer understands the importance of protecting the exclusivity of its distribution network, and is taking positive steps to ensure that its dealers honor their contractual commitments,\u201d Mr. Biver said in the letter, which was seen by The Times.At least one luxury watch brand \u2014 Rolex \u2014 has been at the center of a yearslong legal battle with a gray market merchant.In 2011, a wholesaler that supplies watches to gray market sites, Boneta Inc. of New York, agreed to pay a $325,000 fine and forfeit $1.9 million in what the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement called gray market watches and parts, the agency said at the time.The company\u2019s chief executive, Erik Boneta, had tried to import some Rolexes that the brand had authorized for sale only outside the United States, the agency said. After those were seized at John F. Kennedy International Airport, officers investigated the company\u2019s activities and seized more than 200 Rolexes from Mr. Boneta\u2019s offices.Mr. Boneta said in a recent telephone interview that no charges were filed and that he expected the gray market to endure, even if brands reduce production or improve their online retail presences.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what country or culture or ethnicity,\u201d he said, referring to consumers who buy watches. \u201cPeople want a discount: There is no one looking to pay full retail.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Peru\u2019s Deserts, Melting Glaciers Are a Godsend (Until They\u2019re Gone)", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "Accelerating glacial melt in the Andes caused by climate change has set off a gold rush downstream, letting the desert bloom. But as the ice vanishes, the vast farms below may do the same.Supported byVIRU, Peru \u2014 The desert blooms now. Blueberries grow to the size of Ping-Pong balls in nothing but sand. Asparagus fields cross dunes, disappearing over the horizon.The desert produce is packed and shipped to places like Denmark and Delaware. Electricity and water have come to villages that long had neither. Farmers have moved here from the mountains, seeking new futures on all the irrigated land.It might sound like a perfect development plan, except for one catch: The reason so much water flows through this desert is that an icecap high up in the mountains is melting away.And the bonanza may not last much longer.\u201cIf the water disappears, we\u2019d have to go back to how it was before,\u201d said Miguel Beltr\u00e1n, a 62-year-old farmer who worries what will happen when water levels fall. \u201cThe land was empty and people went hungry.\u201dIn this part of Peru, climate change has been a blessing \u2014 but it may become a curse. In recent decades, accelerating glacial melt in the Andes has enabled a gold rush downstream, contributing to the irrigation and cultivation of more than 100,000 acres of land since the 1980s.Yet the boon is temporary. The flow of water is already declining as the glacier vanishes, and scientists estimate that by 2050 much of the icecap will be gone.Throughout the 20th century, enormous government development projects, from Australia to Africa, have diverted water to arid land. Much of Southern California was dry scrubland until canals brought water, inciting a storm of land speculation and growth \u2014 a time known as the \u201cWater Wars\u201d depicted in the 1974 film \u201cChinatown.\u201dYet climate change now threatens some of these ambitious undertakings, reducing lakes, diminishing aquifers and shrinking glaciers that feed crops. Here in Peru, the government irrigated the desert and turned it into farmland through an $825 million project that, in a few decades, could be under serious threat.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the disappearance of frozen water towers that have supported vast populations,\u201d said Jeffrey Bury, a professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz who has spent years studying the effects of glacier melt on Peruvian agriculture. \u201cThat is the big picture question related to climate change right now.\u201dA changing climate has long haunted Peru. One past civilization, the Moche people, built cities in the same deserts, only to collapse more than a millennium ago after the Pacific Ocean warmed, killing fish and causing flash floods, many archaeologists contend.Now dwindling water is the threat. While more than half of Peru sits in the wet Amazon basin, few of its people ever settled there. Most inhabit the dry northern coast, cut off from most rain by the Andes range. While the region includes the capital, Lima, and 60 percent of Peruvians, it holds only 2 percent of the country\u2019s water supply.The glaciers are the source of water for much of the coast during Peru\u2019s dry season, which extends from May to September. But the icecap of the Cordillera Blanca, long a supply of water for the Chavimochic irrigation project, has shrunk by 40 percent since 1970 and is retreating at an ever-faster rate. It is currently receding by about 30 feet a year, scientists say.Farmers along the 100-mile watershed that winds its way from the snowcapped peaks to the desert dunes say they are already feeling the effects of the change.The retreat of the icecap has exposed tracts of heavy metals, like lead and cadmium, that were locked under the glaciers for thousands of years, scientists say. They are now leaking into the ground water supply, turning entire streams red, killing livestock and crops, and making the water undrinkable.Temperatures in this area have risen sharply, leading to strange changes in crop cycles, farmers say. Over the past decade, corn \u2014 which since precolonial times was grown only once a year in the mountains \u2014 can now be harvested in two cycles, sometimes three.That would be a windfall, said farmers like Francisco Castillo, if it were not for all the pests that now thrive in the warmer air.For Mr. Castillo, who plants corn and rice near the Santa River in Chimbote, it was a worm that became the scourge for him and neighboring farmers. It suddenly started devouring their crops in the early 2000s.Then, last year, came the rats.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a place you had rats before,\u201d Mr. Castillo said.For Justiniano Daga, a 72-year-old farmer, the breaking point for his cotton crops came when red ants ate away the buds. This year, he has decided to plant sugar cane instead and move some of his production to higher altitudes where it is colder.\u201cBut the pests will arrive there, too,\u201d as temperatures keep rising, Mr. Daga said.The Chavimochic project, which lies just north of where the Santa River meets the Pacific Ocean, is a crown jewel of Peruvian agriculture and civil engineering.The government aimed to create industrial-scale agriculture in Peru\u2019s northern deserts through a sprawling system of locks and canals. The idea\u2019s supporters promised profits through exports to markets in North America, Asia and Europe, where the fruit seasons were reversed.The first phase of the project started in 1985 with a 50-mile canal that irrigated a valley and brought a large hydroelectric plant, providing electricity to residents. In the early 1990s, Peru began a second phase, which irrigated two more valleys and created a water treatment plant that served 70 percent of the surrounding population.All told, more than 100,000 acres of desert were brought into cultivation.\u201cYears ago, if I gave you a plot of land here, you\u2019d have said, \u2018What do I do with this?\u2019 \u201d said Osvaldo Talavera, a spokesman for the water district. \u201cNow you\u2019d say, \u2018Do you have another plot for me?\u2019 \u201dAmong the investors was Rafael Quevedo, a wealthy Peruvian landowner who began snapping up arid tracts after studying desert hydroponic techniques in Israel. His proposition was simple: With enough water and fertilizer, asparagus could be grown directly in the sand \u2014 and at yields per acre far higher than in the United States because Peru has no cold season and more days of sun.\u201cWe\u2019ve started a new chapter in the history of cultivation,\u201d said Mr. Quevedo, who runs a farming company called Talsa.Blueberries on a sandy hillside here grow to be five times as big as a normal-size blueberry before being sent to China, where they are prized for their size. A form of white asparagus, favored by Europeans, is grown by burying the stalks in sand. A reservoir was created out of a dune. More than 8,000 tons of produce grows here every year.Yet at the headwaters of the Santa River, in the mountain city of Huaraz, C\u00e9sar Portocarrero, a Peruvian climatologist, sees problems afoot for those downstream.The temperature at the site of the glaciers rose 0.5 to 0.8 degrees Celsius from the 1970s to the early 2000s, causing the glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca to double the pace of their retreat in that period, Mr. Portocarrero said. Several times a year, he and other scientists would make brutal hikes into the glacial valleys, where they found entire sections of the icecap gone. One part of an exposed glacier revealed fossils of dinosaur footprints.A 2012 study by scientists from the United States and Canada showed that water flow in the Santa River was falling, and that at current rates, the river could lose 30 percent of its water during Peru\u2019s dry season.\u201cEach year there is less water; each day there is less water,\u201d Mr. Portocarrero said.When Odar G\u00f3mez headed to Chavimochic to look for work in 1997, he was only the third person to do so from his impoverished mountain town, where many eked out a living with the subsistence farming of corn.It was the start of a wave of migration from the mountainside to the coast set off by the arrival of the water.One coastal town, Viru, went from a population of 9,000 in the 1990s to 80,000 today. Another, Valle de Dios, was an empty desert canyon until it was invaded by squatters in the early 2000s. The new arrivals were mainly agricultural workers and transformed it into a full-fledged town with a pharmacy, a grocery store and a mechanic\u2019s garage.Mr. G\u00f3mez began to work at Talsa, and he headed to the mountains on weekends to recruit others to join him.\u201cNow in my village you have empty homes where whole families have left,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are coming from the Amazon. Chavimochic was our salvation.\u201dThe water has also transformed life on the coast.About a decade ago, a Danish-Peruvian operation installed running water and electricity in the town of Huancaquito Alto, where the business was employing many residents in its packing plant. The town of 2,500 now has a municipal cleaning system that employs trash collectors.\u201cThis was all grassland,\u201d said Edgar Garc\u00eda, a member of the town council, pointing at a new public plaza that was opened last year.Mercedes Beltr\u00e1n grew up in San Bartolom\u00e9, which was barely a village, with only three families. Her grandfather fished from a traditional reed raft. \u201cThere was no market, we bartered between ourselves,\u201d she said.Now her family plants asparagus for the American market, benefiting from competition between buyers that keeps prices high, she said.Even the slightest reduction in the flow of the Santa River causes alarm here. The hydroelectric plant now provides power to 50,000 people; treated river water supplies 700,000 people.\u201cIn years to come, we will be fighting over water,\u201d said Mr. G\u00f3mez.The dam is now \u201ccompletely paralyzed,\u201d with few signs that it will be starting again soon, said Miguel Ch\u00e1vez Castro, the director of the project.Meanwhile, planners here continue to push for more irrigation. They are now eyeing desert tracts farther to the south for a new 80-mile canal that would, at least for now, supply another 50,000 acres of desert with water.But Mr. Garc\u00eda, the council member in Huancaquito Alto, is not taking any chances. He has refurbished an old well used by his father to hold water in the days before this area was irrigated, and he is building a new one near his asparagus fields.\u201cBecause of this water, our children have been able to go to university,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if there is no water from the Santa River, that all changes.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe have to get our wells ready. Sure, it\u2019s like going back in time, but what can we do?\u201dLuis Puell and Andrea Zarate contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

In fact, start-up employees can now defer paying those taxes until there\u2019s an opportunity for them to sell their vested stock.Some start-up employees could owe big tax bills without being able to pay, since privately held companies\u2019 shares are generally harder to sell. Bigger unicorns could draw money from outside investors to let employees cash out \u2014 Uber already has \u2014 but younger start-ups have no such recourse.Companies could pay more cash compensation, using up precious cash flow.

{"Headline": "As Health Care Changes, Insurers, Hospitals and Drugstores Team Up", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAetna also has new partnerships with large health systems that include hospitals and doctors\u2019 groups in Northern California and Virginia.\u201cThere\u2019s been a strong trend for health organizations to want to broaden their footprint, especially on the part of insurers to get more direct contact with the individual,\u201d said Dr. John W. Rowe, a former hospital and insurance executive who is a professor of health policy at Columbia University.While the companies promote these partnerships to employers and consumers as one-stop shopping, they could also put customers at a disadvantage by limiting their choices and increasing medical costs.Under these arrangements, people may not be able to see doctors outside the organization\u2019s own medical group. In addition, patients may worry that their doctor will decide not to order an expensive test to exact savings for the business partners \u2014 the insurer and the health organization. An in-house pharmacy benefit manager could direct customers to certain drugs because its manufacturer offers hefty rebates even if the medicine is more expensive or does not work as well as a competitor\u2019s.And the combined clout of the companies could push consumers\u2019 expenses higher.Employers that purchase coverage on behalf of their workers may also have difficulty determining how much they are paying for a given medicine or a particular service, said Edward A. Kaplan, a senior vice president at Segal Consulting. There\u2019s already a lack of transparency when it comes to drug prices, and employers may have even less information if the insurer and the pharmacy benefit manager are the same entity. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder for us to get behind the curtain,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said.Companies are actively looking for partners that will provide an entree into new businesses or a new supply of customers. CVS Health, which started as a drugstore chain, operates a large pharmacy benefit manager as well as walk-in clinics in its drugstores. By combining with Aetna, which covers about 22 million people, CVS would be able to direct members to its own mail-order and pharmacy business and to its walk-in clinics, located in its drugstores, for much of their care.\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the continued integration in health care,\u201d said Tom Robinson, a partner for Oliver Wyman, a consultant that estimated there have been about 200 partnerships created between insurers and large health groups in the last five years. By sharing in the profits or losses of these ventures, the parties say they work more closely to make sure a patient gets the right medicine or has access to a doctor at a nearby clinic instead of resorting to an emergency room.These partnerships can also represent a dramatic departure from the status quo. In many situations, an insurer and a hospital group would barely talk to each other outside a meeting every year or so to haggle over how much to pay for a knee replacement or an overnight hospital stay. The discussions rarely include how to better manage the care of a patient whose asthma goes untreated or has back pain that would be better treated with physical therapy.The contract negotiations between insurers and hospital systems tend to be \u201ca zero-sum game,\u201d said Brigitte Nettesheim, a senior executive with Aetna. Once the contract is signed, and a conflict arises over the cost or choice of a treatment, the patient is the one often caught in the middle.Aetna started offering joint plans with Inova, a large organization in Northern Virginia, in 2013. The partnership now covers more than 193,000 people. Patients see a doctor who belongs to a special network of primary-care physicians and specialists, most of whom are not employed by Inova but work together closely with the system to coordinate care for patients.Inova was able to finance the creation of this network through the joint venture, and it is now experimenting with new ways of paying the network\u2019s doctors so they bear more responsibility for the overall effectiveness of the care they deliver. If they save money by caring for the patient more efficiently, they share in the savings.Patients in these joint ventures are also assigned a nurse who helps them navigate the system. When a cardiologist prescribed a new cholesterol medicine that required a $200 co-payment, the nurse was able to call the doctor to find a less expensive alternative, saving the patient nearly $2,300 a year, Ms. Nettesheim said. \u201cIt\u2019s about these open lines of communication,\u201d she said.When Banner Health, a large group based in Phoenix, partnered with Aetna to offer a joint health plan, it decided to add 35 retail clinics where people could get care after-hours or closer to their homes rather than show up in the system\u2019s emergency rooms. The clinics \u201care lower-cost options for our members and more convenient,\u201d said Chuck Lehn, the president of the Banner Health Network.It\u2019s too soon to tell whether these new combinations will succeed in delivering on the promises made when they join forces. \u201cThey just tied the knot,\u201d Mr. Robinson of Oliver Wyman said. \u201cNow they have to build the relationship.\u201dFollow Reed Abelson on TwitterAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re watching how the Justice Department might be trying to negotiate some sort of concession from AT&T and Time Warner. More on that in a moment.Now that the House has released its tax overhaul bill, the plainly named \u201cTax Cut and Jobs Act,\u201d expect more and more opposition from groups that stand to lose. That includes businesses from across the spectrum.Here are some groups that would be disadvantaged by provisions of the legislation, at least in its current form:Expect no small amount of lobbying from those businesses \u2014 and from lawmakers in high-tax states, who continue to demand more favorable deductions for state and local taxes.Behind the Broadcom moveOne of the few surprises from yesterday was the announcement that Broadcom \u2014 the chip maker built from a series of acquisitions over the past decade \u2014 plans to relocate its legal headquarters to Delaware from Singapore. While the move isn\u2019t dependent on the tax bill going through, Hock Tan, Broadcom\u2019s famously reticent C.E.O., publicly told President Trump at a news conference: \u201cThanks to you, Mr. President, business conditions have steadily improved.\u201dAT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner is a vertical merger that doesn\u2019t lead to consolidation within one particular industry, leaving few legal options. Mr. Trump has publicly opposed the merger, but the Justice Department\u2019s new antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has said that he won\u2019t let politics sway his decision-making.But other than Andrew Liveris of DowDuPont, it appears that none of the corporate leaders who served on any of the now-disbanded presidential councils is going. G.E., which had a seat on the president\u2019s manufacturing council when Jeff Immelt was C.E.O., is sending a lower-level executive.Mr. Trump is bringing 29 chief executives to Beijing, where the administration hopes to announce billions of dollars of new deals for American industry. But officials are playing down expectations that China will agree to any meaningful opening of its markets.But as social media has become increasingly connected to unpleasant bickering, race-baiting and Russian propaganda, the must-have \u201csocial\u201d label has become an albatross, said Joseph Bayer, an assistant professor at Ohio State University who focuses on social networks.Part of the reason is that, by spreading untruth and outrage, corroding voters\u2019 judgment and aggravating partisanship, social media erode the conditions for the horse-trading that Crick thought fosters liberty.More on Russian meddlingElsewhere in techThe planned departure of Mr. Mercer as Renaissance Technologies\u2019 co-chief executive has come amid protests aimed at university endowments, foundations and pension funds with money invested in the hedge fund.[David] Randall of the Baltimore retirement fund compared the decision to redeem money from Renaissance to the decision of whether to invest in a tobacco company or gun manufacturer. He said Renaissance is one of the fund\u2019s best performing investments.Others are staying put with Renaissance.

{"Headline": "Stitch Fix Prepares an I.P.O. in the Shadow of Amazon", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStitch Fix is an increasingly rare kind of start-up pursuing a public listing, because it has shown it can turn a profit. The question for investors is whether a company whose business could be swamped by Amazon \u2014 in this case, selling clothes over the internet \u2014 is a safe bet.Stitch Fix priced its initial public offering at $15 a share on Thursday, below expectations for $18 to $20 a share, as it embarks upon a new life as a publicly traded company. At that price, Stitch Fix raised about $120 million and was valued at about $1.5 billion.Yet going public is perhaps the least of the challenges that now confront the mail-order clothing service. When the company, based in San Francisco, begins trading on Friday \u2014 on the Nasdaq stock market, under the ticker \u201cSFIX\u201d \u2014 its viability as a stand-alone business will be a concern.Founded six years ago out of the apartment of its founder, Katrina Lake, Stitch Fix was not an obvious candidate for business success. Customers have little choice in which clothing they receive, and it does not promote particularly huge discounts for brand-name dresses and shirts.The way Stitch Fix works, in a nutshell: New customers fill out extensive forms listing their style preferences, clothing needs and price points. Computer programs then predict which items those customers are likely to want, and an army of 3,400 stylists refine those selections. Customers then receive five items via mail, shipping back articles they do not want free of charge.Should a customer keep everything in a box \u2014 a \u201cfix,\u201d in the company\u2019s jargon \u2014 they receive a 25 percent discount.It is a business model that has been tried before, by the likes of the fellow clothing seller Trunk Club and the cosmetics retailer Birchbox. But Stitch Fix has managed to wring profits from the model two years in a row, earning $33.2 million in its 2016 fiscal year. (For the fiscal year ended July 29, it lost $594,000.)In some ways, Stitch Fix is unlike many Silicon Valley peers that promoted high valuations and higher spending rates as marks of success. Before its offering, the company raised only $42.5 million and kept its valuation relatively low, which would allow early backers to receive a bigger return on their investments should the company\u2019s total value increase once it is publicly traded.Its revenues have jumped every fiscal year since 2014. In its most recent fiscal year, which ended July 29, it collected $977.1 million in sales, surpassing last year\u2019s $730.3 million.The company disclosed that as of July 29, it had nearly 2.2 million \u201cactive clients\u201d \u2014 those who place an order and then indicate whether they are keeping any items \u2014 compared with 1.7 million in the year-ago period.Having begun with women\u2019s clothing, Stitch Fix has steadily moved into other business lines, including men\u2019s and maternity. It has also been working on luxury offerings featuring higher-end labels.Scores of traditional retailers have struggled. Macy\u2019s and other department stores have sold off some of their real estate to cope with declining sales. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us has filed for bankruptcy. And J. Crew, which has struggled to adapt to online selling, is among retailers for which a Chapter 11 filing is a distinct possibility.The initial offering will reap a windfall \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 for Stitch Fix executives like Ms. Lake and the company\u2019s few outside investors, including the venture firms Baseline Ventures, Benchmark and Lightspeed Venture Partners. (Benchmark invested in the company at a $300 million valuation three years ago.)Thanks to their owning a special class of stock, Ms. Lake and some early investors will continue to control the company even after the initial offering.But Stitch Fix\u2019s big sales growth cannot last forever. And the challenge that Stitch Fix faces is one that has burdened other start-ups like the food delivery service Blue Apron and the social networking phenomenon Snapchat: incumbent giants that have the money and the hunger to crush upstart rivals.In the case of Stitch Fix, the 800-pound gorilla in the room is Amazon, whose ambitions to stretch out into other industries have sent quakes throughout the business world.\u201cStitch Fix is not better stores, it\u2019s not better e-commerce, it\u2019s a better way,\u201d Ms. Lake asserted in her letter to potential investors.Follow Michael J. de la Merced on Twitter: @m_delamercKatie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Sharp Decline for Jimmy Fallon\u2019s \u2018Tonight Show\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTen months after Inauguration Day, the trend is holding: For late-night hosts, being sharply critical of President Trump is a winning strategy. And that is bad news for \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201dStephen Colbert, who has made Mr. Trump a nightly target, assumed the top position in the ratings race in February and has only increased his lead since then. His program, \u201cThe Late Show\u201d on CBS, has taken viewers away from Jimmy Fallon, the cheerful host of NBC\u2019s storied franchise, who has lost 21 percent of his audience year over year since the fall season began on Sept. 25. At the same time, Jimmy Kimmel has made ratings gains in the 11:35 p.m. slot on ABC.Now even that lead is shrinking.In the November sweeps period, which ended last Wednesday, Mr. Colbert cut into Mr. Fallon\u2019s lead among younger viewers, finishing 57,000 behind him, according to Nielsen data. That\u2019s the closest the CBS host has come to Mr. Fallon among 18- to 49-year-olds in the 27 months the two have competed head-to-head.A year ago, Mr. Colbert trailed Mr. Fallon in that demographic by roughly 364,000 viewers. In the November 2015 sweeps period \u2014 which coincided with Mr. Colbert\u2019s shaky start as a network host \u2014 Mr. Fallon\u2019s lead was nearly 500,000.The size of Mr. Colbert\u2019s entire audience has spiked along with his gains among younger viewers. During the sweeps period, he averaged 3.7 million total viewers a night \u2014 a 23 percent increase from a year ago.Since the fall season began, Mr. Fallon\u2019s audience in the 18-to-49 group has plunged by 26 percent, even though he is, at 43, the youngest of the late-night network hosts.Still, Mr. Fallon does maintain a lead in that demographic, outperforming Mr. Colbert, 53, by 90,000 a night, on average, for the season. He also averages nearly 200,000 more than Mr. Kimmel, the 50-year-old host of \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d on ABC.All three late-night network shows have shed viewers in the 18-to-49 demographic over the last year, but Mr. Fallon\u2019s program has lost significantly more than the other two.The recent declines leave the host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in danger of losing his position as the second-place late-night host. Mr. Kimmel\u2019s show has averaged 2.4 million viewers a night, compared with 2.6 million for Mr. Fallon.A year ago, a battle between Mr. Fallon and Mr. Kimmel was almost unimaginable, given the venerable NBC franchise\u2019s lead of one million total viewers over ABC\u2019s late-night offering.Mr. Fallon does deploy an impression of Mr. Trump, but it lacks bite. His inability to capitalize on the political moment has been an outlier for the network, which has had late-night ratings successes thanks to caustic sketches centered on the president on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d not to mention Seth Meyers\u2019s lawyerly satirical segments on \u201cLate Night\u201d at 12:35 a.m.Mindful of Mr. Fallon\u2019s sunny nature, NBC executives had hoped that Mr. Colbert\u2019s surge in the wild early days of the Trump presidency would die down once the national mood had settled. They envisioned a time when this pair of temperamentally different hosts would trade victories week to week. But in the closing days of 2017, audiences have not returned to the network for Mr. Fallon\u2019s wide-eyed style.Indeed, the November numbers show Mr. Colbert widening the gap, with a lead over Mr. Fallon of 1.1 million viewers.NBC executives remain hopeful that Mr. Fallon can find a way to hold on to the top position among younger viewers. On the upper floors at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, younger viewers are considered the coin of the television realm, and the median age for Mr. Colbert\u2019s audience is 61, compared with 56 for \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201dOne sign of hope for Mr. Fallon: NBC has the rights to \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d through mid-December (they belonged to CBS earlier in the season), and Mr. Fallon\u2019s ratings soared on Thanksgiving, when his show aired after the Giants-Redskins game.Advertisement"}

Now What Do We Do With Their Work?", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThe responses have been breathtaking in their speed and decisiveness. Another powerful man in media or entertainment is accused of being a sexual predator. He admits it, or not. He comes under investigation, or quits, or is fired. And all at once, his work \u2014 no matter how much people liked it before \u2014 turns radioactive.But as more and more once-important figures are banished from sight, at least for the time being, what should become of their work?\u201cThese are very sensitive situations that reflect what has been building up in our industry for years,\u201d Mr. Domingo said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to take a breath, assess and not respond impulsively.\u201dWeighing the worth of an accused perpetrator\u2019s film, television show or news program is nearly impossible in the context of victims\u2019 distress. It\u2019s like comparing apples with unicorns. And so it\u2019s not surprising that emotions are running high.On Tuesday, for instance, Dylan Byers, a senior reporter for media and politics at CNN, waded into a roiling sea of outrage in the usual way people do these days, on Twitter. \u201cBeyond the pain/humiliation women have endured (which is of course the paramount issue), it\u2019s worth taking stock of the incredible drain of talent from media/entertainment taking place right now. Never has so much talent left the industry all at once,\u201d he tweeted.The reaction was immediate and angry. \u201cWhat Dylan Byers meant to say\u201d is that he was disappointed \u201cthat sexual predators are finally getting punished for their actions because he really enjoys binge-watching \u2018House of Cards\u2019 and \u2018Charlie Rose\u2019 reruns,\u201d one woman wrote on Twitter.Those were generally seen as rare cases that (perhaps) could be overlooked because of the men\u2019s particular genius, or because times were different then. What has changed now is the unveiling of evidence that sexually predatory behavior is pervasive and that it has flourished in hierarchical, male-dominated industries that have at best ignored, and at worst enabled, such behavior by powerful and once-untouchable men.In the current period of reckoning, some are arguing that a wholesale expunging or erasure of work by sexual harassers is a small price to pay if it results in a thorough rethinking in creative industries, where the use of sex and power are particularly ill-defined and open to abuse.\u201cWe all have an instinct to instantly try to figure out how to redeem all these people and still be able to enjoy all this work, and it\u2019s a very selfish instinct,\u201d the producer and director Judd Apatow said. In his view, what happens to their work is \u201cthe least important question\u201d on the table.\u201cAll our energy should be with the victims,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened to them? How did people handle this? What could we do going forward to support them in a productive way?\u201dThe moves to yank television shows, to cancel future projects or \u2014 in the case of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cTransparent\u201d \u2014 to consider envisioning popular series without actors who are central to the works\u2019 success, are hardly just a matter of simple morality. In the case of those two programs, there\u2019s also the question of whether audiences would even want to watch them without Mr. Spacey and Jeffrey Tambor, their stars.And it\u2019s difficult to discern to what extent these decisions are being based on matters of principle or economics or publicity or audience interests. Many companies contacted for this article, including Sony and Netflix, refused to comment. And though Netflix continues to show old episodes of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d as well as stand-up specials by Louis C.K., another network, HBO, not only eliminated Louis C.K. from its \u201cNight of Too Many Stars\u201d comedy benefit on Nov. 18 but also removed his past work from its website.In a statement, the network explained that his comedic material too closely resembled his non-comedic actions. \u201cIn looking at previous HBO shows, we also made the decision to no longer make them available as material in them skirted uncomfortably close to his own admittedly repugnant behavior,\u201d the statement said.Some people, like the feminist scholar Camille Paglia, argue that art \u2014 no matter who created it \u2014 should be beyond the scope of punishment.\u201cThe artist as a person should certainly be subject to rebuke, censure, or penalty for unacceptable actions in the social realm,\u201d Ms. Paglia said via email. \u201cBut art, even when it addresses political issues, occupies an abstract realm beyond society.\u201d\u201cIn situations where you get these serial cases with Weinstein or Wieseltier, we\u2019re on safe ground to say, yes, we feel comfortable making the guilty charge and acting accordingly,\u201d said Ms. Kipnis, speaking of the producer Harvey Weinstein and the literary critic Leon Wieseltier, who both face multiple accusations from young women they worked with. She compared their cases to the smaller number of allegations against Mr. Tambor, the \u201cTransparent\u201d star who has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.\u201cIn cases where standards have changed because we\u2019re sensitive to things at the moment where we weren\u2019t 20 years ago, or you just have one or two accusations, you want to act carefully,\u201d Ms. Kipnis said.\u201cWhere I would draw the line might be someplace different from where someone else draws the line,\u201d she added. \u201cIf someone\u2019s an adulterer, do we pull their work? Are you going to take all of Hitchcock\u2019s films out of circulation, and those of every other person who\u2019s been accused of being a sleaze?\u201dIt\u2019s been less than two months since the cascade of harassment scandals began, and when (and if) some of the men caught up in them will ever work again is anybody\u2019s guess.But, Mr. Travers added, that might not even be the most pertinent question. \u201cA lot of people are hoping this is more of a turning point, that the work that\u2019s being lost won\u2019t be missed because the work that\u2019s being gained will be better,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who were silenced and thrown out and kept from working by these predators will be able to go forward and thrive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Trumpets Its Cloud Lead With N.F.L. and Other Deals", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 The holidays are a time when there are constant reminders of how much Amazon dominates online shopping \u2014 the boxes stacking up on front porches, for example.It\u2019s also when Amazon puffs its chest out to say how big it is becoming in a different and much more profitable market: technology used by businesses.One of the customers that Amazon revealed, the National Football League, illustrated how cloud computing is moving beyond basic capabilities like online storage. Those abilities first attracted start-ups and large corporations to the concept of renting computing services from an internet company, rather than running it all themselves.The N.F.L. said it would use Amazon\u2019s advanced machine-learning capabilities \u2014 software that helps recognize patterns and make predictions \u2014 to quickly analyze data captured during games. The data could provide new kinds of statistics for fans and insights that could help coaches.The N.F.L. and Amazon declined to discuss the financial terms of their relationship.Amazon also announced a handful of other new machine-learning efforts. Customers using A.W.S., as the cloud division within Amazon is often called, will be able to add capabilities that mimic human cognition, such as automatic transcribing of speech to text and analysis of videos. Those services are usually expensive and daunting for many companies to add to their applicationsA.W.S. started as a curious side project for the internet retailer more than a decade ago. It has since mushroomed into one of the most important technology providers. It brought in over $12 billion in revenue for Amazon during the first nine months of the year, up 42 percent from a year earlier.More important, A.W.S. generated almost $3 billion in operating income, an enormous benefit to a company which brings in little to no profit from its retail operations.Amazon has caught most of the industry by surprise with its growth into a cloud computing powerhouse. Two rivals, Microsoft and Google, have shown the most determination to narrow Amazon\u2019s lead. Both competitors are also investing heavily in giving machine-learning capabilities to customers.Urs H\u00f6lzle, Google\u2019s senior vice president of technical infrastructure, said his company saw the biggest opportunity in winning over the huge numbers of customers who have not yet shifted their computing chores to the cloud, rather than convincing those that have already adopted Amazon\u2019s services to do so.\u201cFor us to grow very quickly, we don\u2019t need to steal A.W.S. users,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Navigating a Breathtaking Level of Global Economic Change", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cConfidence\u201d is a curious word. It is derived, in part, from the Latin word \u201cfides\u201d which translates to \u201cfaith.\u201d It is a feeling, an inner voice.Just reading the headlines over the past year of what has seemed like a steady parade of crises and potential crises \u2014 North Korea, Russian interference in elections in the United States, post-Brexit Europe, hurricane damage \u2014 you\u2019d think that any sense of \u201cfaith\u201d in the global economy might be shaken, or at least, uncertain.Not so.In conversation after conversation with some of the nation\u2019s top business leaders and chief executives last week, there is a stunning amount of genuine \u201cconfidence\u201d in our economy here and, yes, even globally.\u201cI\u2019m very surprised,\u201d Laurence D. Fink, the founder of BlackRock, the largest money manager in the world overseeing some $6 trillion, said at The New York Times DealBook conference last Thursday, describing his new sense of optimism.\u201cIf you\u2019d asked me a year ago how would you feel, I would\u2019ve told you I\u2019ve got concerns in this region and that region,\u201d he said, making a list. \u201cA year-and-a-half ago we were worried about China,\u201d he added. \u201cA year ago I would\u2019ve said I\u2019m very worried about the eurozone stability,\u201d both of which are now outperforming. \u201cAnd then the other surprise is how robust the U.S. economy is \u2014 how strong corporate profits are. I would say that\u2019s my biggest surprise, how robust corporate profitability is, even with a quite dysfunctional Washington.\u201dPresident Trump, of course, has made a habit of taking credit for the growing economy and stock market returns. \u201cThe reason our stock market is so successful is because of me,\u201d the president said aboard Air Force One last week. \u201cI\u2019ve always been great with money, I\u2019ve always been great with jobs, that\u2019s what I do.\u201dWhether he deserves credit is, being charitable to him, up for debate. But what\u2019s absolutely true is that if the global economy \u2014 and stock market \u2014 is a confidence game, confidence is clearly winning.Mark Cuban, whose disdain for President Trump is so acute that he is considering running for president himself in 2020 as a Republican because it \u201cmeans you get to go head-on with Trump right in the primaries \u2014 and so there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d have more fun doing.\u201d Still, though, he said he believes the economy is in good enough shape that when it comes to investing in the stock market, \u201cI just, you know, I just let it ride.\u201dMr. Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said he keeps a small amount of cash on hand as a precaution. \u201cI keep a little bit, you know, as a hedge. I call it my \u2018Trump hedge\u2019 because you just never know. Now 280 characters can change the market in a heartbeat,\u201d he said, not-so-jokingly alluding to the new character limit on Twitter, Mr. Trump\u2019s communication tool of choice.Still, merger activity, which this column has long argued is the purest measure of confidence \u2014 since most executives only do deals when they are genuinely confident in their own business and the economic environment \u2014 has reached a record high. It bolted in the past several months after what seemed like a surprisingly lackluster beginning of the year as executives appeared to be paralyzed by a sense of uncertainty, trying to gauge the first steps of a new president.It appears that chief executives have found themselves certain that whatever \u201cuncertainty\u201d exists isn\u2019t that uncertain after all.Still, there are pockets of the economy that are causing anxiety. \u201cThe last two or three years have not been fun whatsoever,\u201d Mickey Drexler, the chairman of J. Crew, said at the conference about the traditional retail business, which has been upended by Amazon and changes in consumer behavior. \u201cIt\u2019s been miserable.\u201d Those challenges are extending to mall owners and commercial real estate, too.The question is whether all the enthusiastic talk from chief executives is reflective of a truly robust economy or whether we are missing something.\u201cThere\u2019s so many people talking about the record level of the stock market. The stock market is not a proxy for the economy of America,\u201d said Howard Schultz, executive chairman of Starbucks. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about the millions of Americans who are not participating in the economy.\u201dThat may be worth remembering. If there is a lesson in having confidence, especially when everyone else is feeling that way, it is that it can quickly reverse.\u201cIn the aftermath of corporate and public-sector disasters, it often emerges that participants fell prey to a collective form of willful blindness and overconfidence: mounting warning signals were systematically cast aside or met with denial, evidence avoided or selectively reinterpreted, dissenters shunned,\u201d Roland B\u00e9nabou a professor at Princeton University wrote in a seminal work on confidence and groupthink. \u201cMarket bubbles and manias exhibit the same pattern of investors acting \u2019colorblind in a sea of red flags,\u2019 followed by a crash.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retailers\u2019 Recipe for the Holidays: Big Sales; Fewer Seasonal Workers", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter 14 years of staying home to raise her family, Melanie Colon landed a job for the holidays at a Target store in Queens, selling toys, bedsheets and linens. She hopes it will lead to a full-time position.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about getting back into the work force,\u201d she said.Ms. Colon, 36, is part of an army of temporary retail workers who are hired every year to help with the holiday shopping crush.Holiday hiring gives the economy an annual jolt, raising the incomes of hundreds of thousands of families at Christmas time and offering people like Ms. Colon a chance to make some income, even if only for a few months.But like so much about the retail industry, holiday hiring is in flux, even as stores are poised for a big shopping season. While some large retailers like Target are making a big push, others are hiring fewer temporary workers \u2014 or almost none at all.Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer and private employer, has no plans for a hiring spree this holiday season. Instead, the company said it was giving \u201cmillions more\u201d hours to its thousands of part-time employees, many of whom rely on Walmart as their only job.Across the country, retailers are expected to hire from 500,000 to 550,000 seasonal workers this holiday, down from the roughly 575,000 who were hired last year, according to the National Retail Federation.The decline reflects the forces buffeting the retail industry and the broader economy.With more sales moving to the internet, many brick-and-mortar stores are seeing less foot traffic, which means they need fewer workers manning the aisles. Retailers are also on pace to close thousands of stores this year.\u201cThe industry is going through a transformation,\u201d said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation.The sharp decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has created a tight job market, so fewer Americans need temporary work. With profits under pressure, the last thing that retailers want to do is to get into a bidding war for workers by substantially raising wages.The shifts are evident at Macy\u2019s. The retailer is synonymous with the holiday season, but there is little to cheer about on 34th Street this year.Nearly a quarter of those temporary workers, about 18,000, will be working in fulfillment centers across the country, in places like Goodyear, Ariz., and Martinsburg, W.Va.Macy\u2019s is trying to stem the flow of sales to Amazon by pushing an \u201comni-channel\u201d strategy meant to be all things to all shoppers: a helpful and engaging shopping experience in stores, an alluring website and quick home delivery.It is a tall order that requires big investments. And, as if sensing weakness, Amazon is ratcheting up the pressure.The online-retail giant is hiring 120,000 seasonal workers, many of whom will pick, pack and ship boxes this Christmas. That is on top of the roughly 50,000 permanent workers it added at its fulfillment centers this fall.Conditions suggest that this will be a robust shopping season. Unemployment is low, consumer confidence is high and the stock market has been booming.As a result, holiday sales are projected to increase by as much as 4 percent from a year ago, to $682 billion, according to the National Retail Federation.\u201cThis is as good as it gets,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cIf they can\u2019t survive in this environment, it is hard to imagine they will be around for very long.\u201dHoliday hiring will be an important factor for retailers trying to impress, or, in some cases, win back shoppers.Bringing on too few workers could produce disheveled shelves and long lines \u2014 and sour shoppers even further on brick-and-mortar stores.Executives at Walmart said the decision to forgo adding thousands of seasonal workers was made partly because so many store employees, including those working part time, having been trained in how to navigate new technologies, like hand-held devices for pricing goods and tracking inventory. Training temporary workers on these systems, only to let them go after a few months, would be inefficient.\u201cThis is the same approach we took last year, and we heard great feedback from our customers and associates,\u201d Walmart\u2019s chief operating officer, Judith McKenna, said in a statement.In the end, it is unclear how many additional hours Walmart workers can expect. The company is known as an industry leader in managing costs.Cynthia Murray, a founder of Our Walmart, a labor group, said she had heard from workers who had had their hours reduced in recent weeks, a move she thought was designed to lower costs before the holiday crunch.Staffing in the retail industry is often elastic and tends to mirror consumers\u2019 shopping habits. Many retailers cut back workers\u2019 hours when traffic to stores dies down, including in the fall, before the holidays arrive.\u201cDuring the holiday season, we have millions more hours available than we do during any other time of the year,\u201d a Walmart spokesman said in a statement. \u201cAnd for the second year in a row, we\u2019ve made the decision to give as many of those hours as possible to current full- and part-time associates.\u2019\u2019Among large retailers, Target is making perhaps the biggest holiday hiring splash.The company plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers, up from 70,000 last year, as it makes a push to improve the shopping experience in its stores and grab market share from some of its struggling rivals.In addition to hiring so many seasonal workers, the company said it was raising its starting wage to at least $11 an hour.Ms. Colon, the seasonal worker at the Target in Queens, said she saw an ad seeking holiday help on the retailer\u2019s website. Personally, she does much of her shopping online, but she thinks the stores are important.\u201cI have people come in and say \u2018I am buying this for my sister or I am buying this for my girlfriend,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey want my opinion. You don\u2019t get that online.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Bitcoin Scrapes $10,000, an Investment Boom Like No Other", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Digital gold. The new tulip mania. A virtual currency.Whatever you want to call it, Bitcoin is on an extraordinary run, with the price of a single Bitcoin crossing $10,000 on some exchanges for the first time on Monday \u2014 less than two months after it crossed $5,000 for the first time.It is a bull market with few precedents in recent investing history. The Dow Jones industrial average, in its biggest year, 1915, went up 82 percent, or one-tenth as much as Bitcoin has gone up this year. Amazon\u2019s red-hot stock is up only one-fifteenth as much as Bitcoin this year.These mainstream investors have not just been the libertarian-minded programmers who helped Bitcoin survive its rocky first seven years, after the mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto released it in 2009.On American exchanges, the price was hovering around $9,700 on Monday.The untethered price increase has, to a degree, proved their point, suggesting that this is an investment tied to few real-world fundamentals.But each time the skeptics have come forward, investors have defied them and bought more Bitcoins at higher prices. On Sunday, more than $5 billion was traded on Bitcoin exchanges, according to the data site Coinmarketcap.com \u2014 a greater volume than what many American stock exchanges see on a normal day.Believers in the Bitcoin technology, which is backed by a new kind of computer network, have argued that what we are seeing is the formation of a new asset class that could join stocks, bonds and physical commodities in the investment portfolios of ordinary people.If this is a new digital gold, today\u2019s extraordinary prices still leave the total supply of Bitcoins in the world at a value that is only one-sixtieth of all the real gold in the world.But even aficionados have been dumbstruck by just how quickly the price has gone up in recent months.\u201cWhile there has been a slew of bullish news for Bitcoin of late, the rapidity of the ascent to $10,000 has taken many of us by surprise,\u201d said Chris Burniske, an investor and a co-author of the book \u201cCryptoassets.\u201dOr as one trending comment on the Reddit social network put it: \u201cThis is officially madness. I am going to prepare myself for a large correction.\u201dIn many places, this trading is happening on exchanges with little regulatory oversight or transparency. This has given rise to fears that a problem at one of the exchanges could trigger a panicked run on Bitcoin, something that is not unlikely given the relative inexperience of many of the new investors.A steep rise in the price of Bitcoin in late 2013 was punctured when the biggest exchange at the time, Mt. Gox, was discovered not to have the Bitcoins it claimed to have. That led to a three-year lull in the price.But current investors see that after all the previous popped bubbles \u2014 and there have been several \u2014 the price eventually returned to its old high and then vaulted past it. The price of a Bitcoin is now more than seven times the high it reached in 2013.Bitcoin has been able to flow around the world and reach investors in countries large and small, because of the singular design that was laid out by its creator.Bitcoins are stored and traded on a decentralized network of computers that is not under the control of any government or company. That has been attractive to people in countries, like China and Zimbabwe, where the government has a history of seizing bank accounts and assets.The growing number of people using it in all these countries, often against the wishes of their governments, has also underscored the degree to which the software that manages Bitcoin has remained impervious to hackers and government control for nearly a decade.The recent price increases, though, have meant that Bitcoin is not living up to its promise as a currency routinely used for small purchases. Few people want to spend their Bitcoins if they believe the price will double in the next month.Bitcoin has remained popular as a way to pay for illegal drugs online because of the ability to open a Bitcoin wallet without providing any personal information.But Bitcoin has faced competition on this front from virtual currencies that provide more privacy. And the overall black market trade has diminished this year after the authorities took down some of the largest black market websites in the summer.This has been welcome news for many Bitcoin backers who want to see it lose its shadowy associations.Many Bitcoin investors have also come to believe that the Bitcoin network is not particularly well suited to handle lots of little transactions.These investors frequently argue that what Bitcoin is designed to do well is store money securely and outside the control of any company or government that could seize it, like a more transportable version of gold.\u201cThe reason people own Bitcoin is because it\u2019s a great store of value, possibly the greatest that has ever existed,\u201d said Jimmy Song, a programmer who works on the Bitcoin software.The last few years have brought a proliferation of virtual currencies that aim to compete with Bitcoin, sometimes with the goal of handling transactions more cheaply and quickly.This year, it appeared that the most popular virtual currency network other than Bitcoin, Ethereum, might pass Bitcoin in value. At the time, Bitcoin was hobbled by an internal battle over how to update the software and expand the network.In October, though, one side gave up the fight, and since then the price of Bitcoin has shot up, sometimes rising more in a week than it rose in its first seven years.In recent weeks, Bitcoin isn\u2019t the only virtual currency that has been moving up. Ether, which lives on the Ethereum network, and Bitcoin Cash, another Bitcoin competitor, have also been rising quickly in value as investors look for anything that might have the same durability and upward mobility as the original.Advertisement"}

So in 2015, she created a list of 100 black vegans for a website. It included pioneering figures like Dick Gregory and Coretta Scott King and younger, less famous writers, filmmakers, cooks and activists.Many people who give up eating animal products do it for their health, or for animal welfare. The same is true for the new veganism among African-Americans, but there is an added layer of another kind of politics.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about I want to eat well so I can live long and be skinny,\u201d said Jenn\u00e9 Claiborne, a personal chef and cooking teacher who recently moved to Los Angeles from New York. Her first cookbook, \u201cSweet Potato Soul,\u201d is due out in February. \u201cFor a lot of black people, it\u2019s also the social justice and food access. The food we have been eating for decades and decades and has been killing us.\u201dMs. Claiborne, 30, is part of a new generation of vegan cooks who are transforming traditional soul food dishes, digging deeper into the West African roots of Southern cooking and infusing new recipes with the tastes of the Caribbean.As a result, ideas about the dull vegan stews and stir-fries that were standard-bearers among the early generations of black vegan cooks are changing \u2014 albeit slowly.\u201cSome folks are kind of stuck in the \u201970s,\u201d said Jessica B. Harris, 69, an author and a food scholar of the African diaspora. \u201cTheir food seems to come with a dashiki. And don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s like fried chicken when it\u2019s tofu.\u201dHis recipe for millet cakes is bright with the brick-red Ethiopian spice blend berbere. He likes to serve it with a sauce built from roasted green peppers, garlic and cilantro, and infused with heat from jalape\u00f1os.\u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s a quiet wink to the \u201970s-style macrobiotic veggie burgers,\u201d he said. But it pales in comparison to what a new batch of black vegan cooks are doing. \u201cI cook like someone\u2019s grandma,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really excited about are some of the younger chefs who are professionally trained and know how to put food together in a new way.\u201dOne of them is Ms. Claiborne, who grew up in suburban Atlanta and moved to New York after college to pursue an acting career. Her father was raised vegan, according to Hebrew Israelite beliefs, and still eats that way 90 percent of the time, she said. She grew up eating everything but red meat, and learned to cook soul food at her grandmother\u2019s side.She adds butternut squash to sweet potato pie to create the texture usually contributed by eggs. Oyster mushrooms stand in for shrimp in Creole \u00e9touff\u00e9e. She puts jackfruit in her jambalaya and cooks down collard greens with soy sauce and smoked paprika instead of pork.Health is often not enough of a reason for people to give up meat, she said. The challenges that come with being black in America can be. \u201cWhen it\u2019s bigger than you, and it\u2019s political and it\u2019s spiritual, that is an entrance point for people,\u201d she said.The toughest cultural touchstone to let go of is fried chicken, she said. \u201cPeople tell me: \u2018I can\u2019t do without the chicken. I\u2019d rather die a painful death than have to give up chicken,\u2019\u201d she said. To help, she created spicy chicken-fried cauliflower, in which she builds a crunchy crust by dipping large florets into heavily seasoned flour and then a wet batter of hot sauce, Dijon mustard and soy milk.The event was part of Hip Hop Is Green, a health initiative started by Keith Tucker of Seattle that produces dinners and concerts that promote plant-based eating.Tassili Ma\u2019at, 60, owns Tassili\u2019s Raw Reality in the historic West End of Atlanta. She raised her youngest two children as vegans, and now eats only raw food. She\u2019s a member of the Atlanta chapter of Hip Hop Is Green, which she says is a way to help young people identify veganism as both \u201csomething cool and something political.\u201d\u201cI acknowledge my customers for being modern-day revolutionaries without picking up a gun or having to throw a grenade or pick up a picket sign and carry it down the street,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are defying the death industry.\u201dThen again, sometimes it\u2019s just about eating something delicious and having fun. To that end, cooks in several cities have begun hosting black-focused vegan food festivals and \u201cmac downs,\u201d where hundreds of people compete in vegan mac-and-cheese competitions.Theirs is one of dozens of new black-owned vegan restaurants that have popped up recently in cities like Los Angeles, Detroit and New York.\u201cYou can\u2019t say all vegans have to support animal welfare or social justice,\u201d Ms. Wright-Brown said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to beat you in the head.

It costs too much.Ed Life, in the in-house vernacular, has tried to explain this complex world.As I leaf through back issues, flipping through the college careers of Gen X-ers to millennials to Gen Ys, I see much that provides perspective on what campuses wrestle with even today:It is 10:30 a.m., two hours before the Florida Gators will kick off to Ole Miss, and Max, a 19-year-old freshman, is laboring to explain how he feels about the drinking age. \u201cPer-son-al-ly,\u201d he says, punching out each slurred syllable, \u201cI do agree the age should be lowered.

For while robust intellectual inquiry is a self-stated goal of every university, so too is creating a diverse and tolerant nation.In 2002, in an award from the Education Writers Association, the judges wrote: \u201cThe New York Times for years has offered a rich mix of news, features, human interest, reviews and service journalism in its quarterly education section. They have sustained this high-qualify effort through the thick and thin of advertising, a real credit to the newspaper.\u201dThe eccentric aunt has grown thinner over the years. This is the last you\u2019ll see of her as you know her. But The Times promises to continue its commitment to education. A new section will appear some time next year \u2014 just as, 30 years ago, Education Life replaced a triannual called the Survey of Education. Consider it all part of a continuum. . . .Plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose.Jane Karr is the editor of Education Life.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Bull Market Should Make Investors Happy. This One Isn\u2019t.", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne day in September, investors with fading summer tans mingled with their brokers over a three-course lunch at Cipriani in Lower Manhattan. Stocks were soaring and they swapped market tips and touted apps that allowed them to buy Bitcoin on the golf course.But the full stomachs and fat portfolios couldn\u2019t mask a sense of unease that pervaded the gathering: that the good times could suddenly end, derailed by nuclear war, political upheaval, a sudden rise in inflation or simply from stratospheric stocks crashing down to earth.\u201cInvestors have never felt less secure, even though we are eight years into a bull market,\u201d Mark H. Haefele, the chief investment officer in the wealth management division at the investment bank UBS, told the crowd.Rarely has a bull market been so unloved. Since March 2009, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index has nearly quadrupled in value. This year, not only is the index up 15 percent, but it also seems to have stopped going down at all: October was the 12th straight month that the S.&P. has logged a positive return, the first time that has happened since 1935.Yet in most conversations about the ever-rising stock market, brokers and investment advisers say, are dominated by the question of when it will all come to an end.With the exception of President Trump, of course. On Saturday, in an interview on Air Force One, he once again took credit for the market\u2019s most recent record close on Friday.Generally, this far into a bull market, euphoria kicks in. In 1929, shoeshine boys were doling out stock tips. In 1999, people were quitting their jobs to trade technology stocks from their living rooms.\u201cThe VIX is too low, valuations are too high, the recovery is too old and the Fed is tightening,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, a veteran market strategist for the Leuthold Group in Minnesota. \u201cFor an old market dude like me, that is a scary list.\u201dFor several years now, Mr. Paulsen has been pleading with his clients to embrace the bull market. He has touted the breadth of the surge, in which no single sector has dramatically outrun another on the way up. And he has argued that worldwide growth with little inflation represents an unusual buying opportunity.When he meets with clients or presents his views at conferences, though, the vast majority of the questions he receives are about what will ultimately bring the market crashing down.\u201cNo one ever asks me when the S.&P. is going to blow past 3,000,\u201d he said of the benchmark stock index which ended trading on Friday at 2,587.84.In fact, many analysts say that this so-called wall of worry is a positive sign. Investors may be piling into stocks and bonds, the thinking goes, but they are doing it with a measure of hesitation, which prevents some of the excesses that preceded previous market corrections.That is not to say the market is without froth.Since early 2009, the market capitalizations of Amazon and Apple, have soared from $26 billion and $74 billion to $532 billion and $872 billion.The surge in the price of Bitcoin strikes many observers, including the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, as a classic portent of a bubble ready to pop.These are not exactly the hallmarks of a restrained market.To a large extent, the main drivers of the bull market have been sophisticated investors. Cash holdings by institutions and high-net-worth investors are at record low levels, which means they have been plowing money into the markets, according to numerous surveys.Many retail investors, though, have remained on the sidelines \u2014 a sharp contrast to the activity that preceded the bursting of previous bubbles.According to Charles Schwab, which oversees $3.1 trillion in retail investments, the cash portion of client accounts was 11.1 percent as of September. That is down from 13 percent at the end of last year, but it is still a sizable ratio, which suggests that investors are not dumping their entire savings into the stock market, at least for now.Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist for Schwab, said that until just recently, investors have been highly skeptical that the market\u2019s bull run was justified. However, in the last month or so, she has noticed a change in sentiment at client meetings and investor events.\u201cSome investors are conceding it\u2019s a bull market,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are looking for approval to jump on the bandwagon.\u201dStill, she points out, retail investors have nowhere near the commitment to stocks that characterized past stock market booms.Richard Bernstein, a former equity strategist at Merrill Lynch who now runs his own investment firm, has been bullish on stocks since 2009. He said that by this point of a strong equity run, buying stocks traditionally becomes widely accepted by all investor classes \u2014 the consequence of one outstanding stock market year following another. Nobody wants to hear their neighbors boasting about their sizzling portfolios without having their own good news to share.That is not the case this time. According to Mr. Bernstein, Wall Street experts on average advise investors to put 55 percent of their portfolios into stocks, as opposed to other assets such as bonds. That is considerably more conservative than the traditional recommendation that investors have up to 65 percent in stocks.And many pension funds, instead of investing in the stock market, are putting money into private-equity investments, even though they incur hefty fees and their money generally gets locked up for 10 years.\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cSo when people say there is euphoria in the market and people are getting carried away, I say, \u2018who are we talking about?\u2019\u201dLate last month, at an investor panel sponsored by the fund company Eaton Vance, Mr. Bernstein cited the rising South Korean stock market in arguing that fears of nuclear war were overblown and should not be used as an excuse for investors to avoid putting their money into stocks.As usual, the pushback was quick in coming.What happens if war breaks out in the Korean Peninsula, a member of the audience asked him. Wasn\u2019t he ignoring that possibility?Mr. Bernstein argued that investors should care the economic and corporate fundamentals \u2014 not the remote chance that a calamity will strike.\u201cYou cannot invest successfully,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you are crouched under your desk in a fetal position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where the STEM Jobs Are (and Where They Aren\u2019t)", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe national priority in education can be summed up in a four-letter acronym: STEM. And that\u2019s understandable. A country\u2019s proficiency in science, technology, engineering and mathematics is vital in generating economic growth, advancing scientific innovation and creating good jobs.The STEM campaign has been underway for years, championed by policymakers across the ideological spectrum, embraced in schools everywhere and by organizations ranging from the YWCA to the Boy Scouts. By now, the term \u2014 first popularized and promoted by the National Science Foundation \u2014 is used as a descriptive identifier. \u201cShe\u2019s a STEM,\u201d usually meant as a compliment, suggests someone who has a leg up in the college admissions sweepstakes.Much of the public enthusiasm for STEM education rests on the assumption that these fields are rich in job opportunity. Some are, some aren\u2019t. STEM is an expansive category, spanning many disciplines and occupations, from software engineers and data scientists to geologists, astronomers and physicists.What recent studies have made increasingly apparent is that the greatest number of high-paying STEM jobs are in the \u201cT\u201d (specifically, computing).\u201cThere is a huge divide between the computing technology roles and the traditional sciences,\u201d said Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor\u2019s chief economist.In a recent analysis, Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, focused on the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment forecasts in STEM categories. In the decade ending in 2024, 73 percent of STEM job growth will be in computer occupations, but only 3 percent will be in the physical sciences and 3 percent in the life sciences.A working grasp of the principles of science and math should be essential knowledge for all Americans, said Michael S. Teitelbaum, an expert on science education and policy. But he believes that STEM advocates, often executives and lobbyists for technology companies, do a disservice when they raise the alarm that America is facing a worrying shortfall of STEM workers, based on shortages in a relative handful of fast-growing fields like data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and computer security.\u201cWhen it gets generalized to all of STEM, it\u2019s misleading,\u201d said Mr. Teitelbaum, a senior research associate in the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School. \u201cWe\u2019re misleading a lot of young people.\u201dIf physicists and biologists want to enjoy the boom times in the digital economy, a few specialist start-ups will train them and find them jobs as data scientists and artificial intelligence programmers.Carlos Faham made that passage. He had an impressive academic career, with a string of grant awards and fellowships. His Ph.D. from Brown University was in dark-matter physics. After Brown, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.Dr. Faham loved the research, but after nearly two years he was feeling the strain of that life. By then, he had spent 12 years in college, graduate school and postgraduate research. His next step would be to compete for a handful of tenure-track teaching openings across the country. For the pricey Bay Area, he wasn\u2019t making enough. A postdoc researcher typically makes $40,000 to $60,000 a year.Dr. Faham had done serious programming for his physics research. He applied to tech companies, figuring they would be eager to hire someone with his intellectual firepower. He couldn\u2019t get an in-person interview. He was told his background was too academic. He fumbled a couple of phone screening interviews because the statistical and machine-learning problems were unfamiliar to him.\u201cIt was like hitting a wall running at full speed, really humbling,\u201d he recalled.Dr. Faham joined the seven-week Insight Data Science Fellows program in 2015. There was no formal course work. Other than a few tutorials by industry people, the time was spent creating a product \u2014 his was software for recognizing and tracking faces in video \u2014 and training for interviews. That involved solving a programming problem on a white board and explaining his thinking. \u201cInterviewing is a muscle and you have to exercise it again and again,\u201d he said. After the program, he received six job offers. He accepted the offer from LinkedIn. (Insight is free for participants; hiring companies pay an undisclosed fee.)Today, Dr. Faham, 33, is a senior data scientist, working on a team that uses machine learning and statistical models to detect illicit activity on the social network, including fake job listings, ad fraud, spam and bot attacks.The range of data-intensive detective work, he said, is \u201cextremely rich\u201d and \u201cit moves so much faster than my previous world.\u201d He makes a \u201cpretty good six-figure salary,\u201d about five times what he did as a postdoctoral researcher.About 90 percent of those who enter the Insight program have landed jobs as data analysts, the company says, with a dropout rate of about 3 percent.Anasuya Das made a similar career move, but not one as far from her academic training. After the program, Dr. Das, whose Ph.D. is in neuroscience, joined the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she is now a senior data scientist. She works on a team that creates software tools for the center\u2019s doctors, nurses and researchers. One current project is a program to recommend the most promising clinical trials for individual cancer patients, based on their medical histories, age, gender and genetics.Data science is distinctly different from neuroscience, Dr. Das said, but some of the tools she employs, like a machine-learning technique called artificial neural networks, do take their inspiration from the brain. Her experience points to the larger trend that digital technologies like data science and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in nearly every discipline. So technology and the other STEM fields merge.That is the thinking behind a new division of data sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, that started in July. The division is a response to student demand and advancing technology. Berkeley\u2019s \u201cFoundations of Data Science\u201d course attracted 1,200 students from more than 50 majors in the last academic year.The choice of the term \u201cdivision\u201d rather than \u201cinstitute,\u201d explained David Culler, the interim dean for data sciences, underlines its approach. \u201cWe want this to be something foundational across the university, innovating with other disciplines, not differentiating from them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the academic world mirroring what is happening in the larger economy.\u201dSteve Lohr is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

You Can See It Now", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the not-too-distant future, a traveler\u2019s face will replace a boarding pass, and recognition software will replace the gate agent scanning each traveler\u2019s ticket. Airline executives separated by distance will be able to use virtual reality eyewear to walk together through an airplane cabin and solve design problems.In this same future, autonomous vehicles could help passengers check in and airplanes push back.The future is now as the aviation industry embraces new technology as enthusiastically as it does jumbo jets packed with well-behaved, premium-fare paying passengers.\u201cThey\u2019ve got expectations from shopping on Amazon,\u201d said Jim Peters, chief technology officer for the airline-owned technology company SITA. \u201cThey get information when they want it. They collaborate with friends and they expect that will be a natural way for them to be interacting as they travel.\u201dOne of the newest developments in aviation evolved from consumer video games. As the visual product improved, virtual reality products using fine-tuned, realistic 3-D environments were incorporated for design, training and marketing in the air travel industry.It would take \u201ccrazy-man money\u201d to actually build a prototype and inspect it this way, said David Balfour, a visualization specialist with the company. Virtual reality allows airlines to \u201cput a virtual-reality headset on and stand up and view an entire cabin.\u201dIn the virtual-reality environment, to err is actually a good thing, said Glenn Johnson, director of the design studio at Rockwell Collins.Designs \u201cfail quicker and cheaper,\u201d he said, which means improvements can come faster.This ability to create large and complex environments also makes virtual reality promising for training airfield staff members who work in hazardous environments, servicing airliners in all kinds of weather and light conditions.\u201cYou are living the training because you are active in the training,\u201d Mr. Leger said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a game where you have a score at the end, so it goes to the emotional part of your brain.\u201dConsidering that airline pilots do recurrent training in a simulator on a regular basis, bringing a simulated setting to other areas of the industry is not a new concept. It is only recently, however, that the improved quality and lower cost of virtual reality have made its widespread use practical.With all the showy advantages of virtual reality, some airlines are trying to turn the \u201cwow\u201d into revenue. At a pop-up cafe in London earlier this month, Air Canada invited visitors to watch a Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight in virtual reality. The German airline Lufthansa prepared a 360 video of the interior of its long-haul aircraft, and its employees presented viewing goggles to ticketed passengers waiting at boarding gates in Newark and Frankfurt last year. After watching the show, Lufthansa, asked if they wanted to purchase an upgrade to a premium economy seat.\u201cHow can you communicate a travel product? This is the problem in the industry,\u201d said Torsten Wingenter, Lufthansa\u2019s senior director of digital innovations. Virtual reality gave the company the \u201cfirst chance to show the product in an emotional way.\u201dAfter the test, the emotion at the airline can be described as happy. A number of economy passengers paid $299 more to fly in premium economy after viewing the cabin in virtual reality. Mr. Wingenter would not say how many, but that it was \u201ca significant number.\u201dIn December, Lufthansa passengers flying out of Los Angeles will be able to use what JetBlue customers in Boston are already using \u2014 boarding gates that let passengers onto the airplane with no paper ticket or electronic boarding pass, just a face that matches their passport photo.On two JetBlue routes, from Boston to Aruba and the Dominican Republic, passengers stand in front of a camera that takes their picture and compares it to the traveler\u2019s image in the passport database of Customs and Border Protection.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing about three seconds for the photograph to be taken, transmitted and a positive response back,\u201d said Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue\u2019s executive vice president of customer experience.Facial recognition will be expanded. Ms. Geraghty said this was the beginning of a new era for travelers.\u201cYou can go into an airport and you won\u2019t need to show a boarding card, you won\u2019t need to pull out a passport,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be no bag tag, no lines, you almost walk right onto an aircraft. That\u2019s the world I look forward to.\u201dMs. Geraghty is like many aviation technology specialists who look at developments in other industries and think about how they could improve air travel.In a workshop in Geneva, SITA has several robots that travel to industry conferences around the world to start conversations about how autonomous vehicles might be used in aviation.Whether Kate or Leo end up at your local airport is not the point, said Mr. Peters, SITA\u2019s technology chief.\u201cThe robots are also demonstrators to get people talking about what is the future of autonomous vehicles in the airport,\u201d Mr. Peters said. But for all that technology has to offer, one of the most important tests is how well the next new gadget plays with people.\u201cSome things can be prototyped and some things can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cSome things you have to have a physical interaction with to figure out what works.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Shape of Water\u2019: Meet Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Favorite Creature", "Date": "2017-11-23", "News": "Doug Jones has had crucial roles in many of the director\u2019s projects; this is the first time he\u2019s been the star \u2014 and a romantic hero at that.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Four years ago, while filming \u201cCrimson Peak,\u201d the director Guillermo del Toro called Doug Jones into his office. The actor already had two small roles in the gothic romance \u2014 the hideous ghosts of a pair of long-dead mothers \u2014 but the director had another part in mind for him, a bigger one, in a film yet to come. Mr. del Toro spun a wondrous tale about a cleaning lady in an American research facility who falls in love with a mysterious merman fished from the murky depths of the Amazon. In this unlikeliest of monster movies, the creature was the hero and love interest, and the director wanted Mr. Jones to play him.It wasn\u2019t the first time the director had enlisted Mr. Jones, all 6-foot-3 of him, to play a fantastical creature. In a string of del Toro films stretching back to 1997, he has played a mutated insect (\u201cMimic\u201d), a worm-spewing vampire (\u201cThe Strain\u201d) and a spectral creature with blood-red eyeballs in the palms of his hands (\u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d). He\u2019s been an erudite fish-man (\u201cHellboy\u201d and \u201cHellboy II\u201d), an angel of death (\u201cHellboy II\u201d), and a whimsical hybrid of human, tree and goat (\u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d).But this was the first time Mr. del Toro had called upon the actor to play both monster and leading man. Could Mr. Jones be convincing as an amphibian lover, the creature who gets the girl, all while sporting a bulky body suit and gills?\u201cGuillermo said, \u2018I know you\u2019re a good Catholic boy, and there\u2019s some romance involved in this one that might get steamy,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Jones recalled.Mr. del Toro explained further in an interview, \u201cThere\u2019s a very rarefied strata of performer that can work with makeup and the suits, the many hours of prosthetic work and mechanisms whirring in your ears. And within that strata there\u2019s an even more rarefied one, and I think Doug stands alone, in which you can actually consider them proper actors.\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Jones stars in \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d as the captive of Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), a Cold War-era Army colonel who hopes to gut him and study his innards, for science. The actress Sally Hawkins (\u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d) plays the mute janitor who woos him with boiled eggs, Benny Goodman albums and a winsome smile.\u201cHe\u2019s a gift, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Ms. Hawkins said. \u201cIt was so easy to fall in love with Doug.\u201dNattily dressed in a white cardigan, striped blue tie and jeans, Mr. Jones was funny and animated, illustrating points with flourishes of his giant, pianist-like hands. Although he\u2019s spent a lifetime playing freaks, he\u2019s remarkably normal-looking in person, despite his protests, with high cheekbones and deep blue eyes.At Ball State University, he fell in love with mime. His first job out of college was a gig as a roving mime at an Indiana theme park. \u201cWhy is the painted man not talking?\u201d kids shrieked. \u201cI was basically scaring children all summer,\u201d he said.\u201cThe reputation I got was that I was tall and skinny and moved well and wore a lot of crap on my face and didn\u2019t complain about it,\u201d he said. The \u201cnot complaining about it\u201d part was key. \u201cApparently, for actors,\u201d he said, \u201cthat makes you exceptional.\u201dCommercial work led to roles in features, including \u201cHocus Pocus\u201d and \u201cBatman Returns,\u201d and collaborations with some of the biggest names in the creature-effects business, like Stan Winston and Rick Baker. When Mr. Jones first met Mr. del Toro, during the filming of \u201cMimic,\u201d they bonded over their love of monsters and their creators. \u201cWe were connecting on the level of grade-school boys, like, \u2018Did you see that monster? Wasn\u2019t it cool?\u2019\u201d Mr. Jones said.For his own creature, the director asked Mr. Jones to combine elements of the Silver Surfer (the Christlike superhero he played in a 2007 \u201cFantastic Four\u201d film) and a matador. He also had to be like an animal in the wild. \u201cGuillermo would shout at me, animal, animal!\u201d he said.The lead creature designer and sculptor Mike Hill was tasked with creating the fishman\u2019s suit. \u201cThe main direction I got from Guillermo was, \u2018Make him sexy,\u2019 \u201d he said. Mr. Hill got rid of the reptilian plates from an earlier design, and crafted a more kissable, less fishlike mouth. He gave the creature the broad shoulders and small waist of a swimmer, and a heroic cleft chin. And then there\u2019s the creature\u2019s hindquarters. \u201cGuillermo was adamant that we give him a sexy butt,\u201d Mr. Hill said.As lovely as the costume was, it was a bear to wear. For three hours a day, Mr. Jones sat while Mr. Hill and three other artists put the thing on: the foam latex suit and gloves, the fiberglass helmet with eyes he couldn\u2019t see out of, the sharp fangs, the remote-control gizmos in his spine. The suit itself was so form-fitting that Mr. Jones had to use K-Y Jelly to squeeze inside; when wet, which it nearly always was, it soaked up pounds of water like a sponge. \u201cHe never complained once,\u201d Mr. Hill said.The cast and crew got a sense of what Mr. Jones endured every day when a professional dancer was brought in as a body double for a particularly challenging dance sequence. \u201cHe got into the suit, did one pirouette, and then proceeded to projectile vomit,\u201d Mr. del Toro remembered.\u201cThat\u2019s how good Doug is,\u201d Ms. Hawkins said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t see, he couldn\u2019t hear properly, and yet his performance is so beautiful and so delicate. He is the film. It just wouldn\u2019t work without him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And Embark, a Silicon Valley start-up, is set to announce on Monday that it has been testing its self-driving technology as part of a three-way partnership with the truck-leasing company Ryder and the appliance giant Electrolux.\u201cWe are trying to get self-driving technology out on the road as fast as possible,\u201d said Alex Rodrigues, Embark\u2019s chief executive. \u201cTrucking needs self-driving and self-driving needs trucking.\u201dUnlike autonomous cars, which face questions about navigating chaotic urban streets, trucks spend a lot of time heading straight on desolate highways. And while the advent of the self-driving car will rest on the decisions of individual consumers, logistics companies are unemotional operators that will upgrade their fleets the moment it makes financial sense.Trucking is a $700 billion industry that touches every corner of the economy. Trucks haul natural resources from mines and forests. They transport industrial building blocks from manufacturers and deliver goods to stores and homes. Virtually every physical product from food to paper towels and furniture has touched a truck several times by the time it gets to a consumer\u2019s hands.The industry\u2019s size makes it a fat target for automation. Autonomous technology will help trucking companies reduce labor costs in the long run, first by extending the number of hours trucks are in operation, and later, by reducing the number of drivers. The industry spends billions of dollars a year on accidents that are largely caused by human error, and billions more on insurance premiums that should go down if and when self-driving technology is proven to be safer than human drivers.Even companies not explicitly chasing the goal of self-driving trucks are moving steadily toward a more automated future. The 7,000-plus trucks owned by US Xpress, one of the nation\u2019s largest trucking companies, have been updated with autonomous braking and collision-avoidance systems. Max Fuller, the company\u2019s co-founder and executive chairman, plans to upgrade them to have automated lane steering in three years.\u201cI\u2019m putting building blocks into my trucks that each year gets us closer and closer,\u201d he said.Companies have a lot to get through before they can start legally operating trucks without drivers. Beyond technical and regulatory hurdles, the industry is sure to be challenged by wild cards like how human drivers react to seeing a unmanned truck gliding down the highway and how regulators respond when the inevitable first deadly autonomous-trucking accident occurs. If such a backlash were to happen before the technology has been widely adopted, it could slow things for years.But whenever self-driving trucks arrive, there will be economic ripples, affecting insurance premiums, truck stops, vocational schools and the roads themselves. \u201cThis is the most powerful thing to hit us since the building of the superhighways in the 1950s,\u201d said No\u00ebl Perry, an economist at FTR Research, which tracks the logistics industry.One afternoon in Florida, a 59-year-old career truck driver named Jeff Runions sat alertly in the cab of an 18-wheeler watching the road while his 11-ton cargo of stone tile made its way up the Ronald Reagan Turnpike. He was watching his steering wheel, too, but his hands were at his side: A computer was in control.Mr. Runions works for Starsky Robotics, a San Francisco start-up that for the past two years has been testing its self-driving technology by running freight up and down Florida. The runs help collect data and hone the technology, in hopes of convincing regulators and the company itself that self-driving trucks are ready for business.There are still plenty of kinks. Sitting next to Mr. Runions was an Irish engineer named Rebecca Feeney Barry. As the vehicle spent hours driving past swamps and billboards for accident lawyers, Ms. Feeney Barry balanced a laptop on her knees and watched how the truck\u2019s sensors interpreted the road and nearby cars.At one point the computer\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d briefly lost sight of the freeway because an overpass shaded the road. Later, the truck didn\u2019t take a turn hard enough, prompting Mr. Runions to grab the wheel. Ms. Feeney Barry logged all of it. Later, after some computer code had been altered to tell the truck to tug the wheel a bit harder, it made a similar turn more smoothly.\u201cSometimes it kind of messes me up when I go back to driving because now I\u2019m used to the truck driving,\u201d Mr. Runions said.Starsky\u2019s ultimate plan, of course, is to eliminate Mr. Runions\u2019s job. But they do not want him to be out of one. Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Starsky\u2019s 27-year-old chief executive, foresees using self-driving technology to replace long-haul drivers on freeways, but having people like Mr. Runions navigate at either end of the trip with remote control consoles that look like an arcade racing game.Drivers would go off to work in offices and might spend their day driving trucks through the last few miles of several different routes in several different cities before heading home for dinner.\u201cOne driver can drive 10 to 30 trucks per day,\u201d Mr. Seltz-Axmacher said.Starsky\u2019s vision of a remote operation is unique. But the basic idea \u2014 having trucks drive themselves on highways and letting human drivers take over in complicated city environments \u2014 is something of an industry consensus.\u201cOne of the big misconceptions about self-driving technology is that it is going to emerge and be able to drive all the time in all circumstances,\u201d said Alden Woodrow, the product manager for Uber\u2019s self-driving truck unit.As part of their partnership, Embark, Ryder and Electrolux are conducting what amounts to elaborate dry runs to imagine what self-driving-truck routes will look like. The runs start with human drivers leaving an Electrolux warehouse in El Paso and driving to the edge of the city, where they hitch the trailer to one of Embark\u2019s autonomous trucks.From there the truck drives itself for 650 highway miles (with a safety driver in tow) to Ontario, Calif., where the Embark drivers transfer their trailer to another Ryder driver, who drives the final few miles to one of Electrolux\u2019s California warehouses.\u201cIt\u2019s a mirror of what we would do if there weren\u2019t a driver inside,\u201d said Mr. Rodrigues, the Embark chief.A few miles from Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., a company called Peloton Technology is betting that there is a business to be built in a less radical version of automation. Peloton is on the cusp of rolling out a system that will make it easier and safer for trucks to travel one after the other on the highway, in a formation called platooning, helping them save gas by reducing wind drag.Trucks with drivers already do this. But Peloton\u2019s technology aims to make platooning safer with a mix of cameras, sensors and networking equipment, allowing the trucks to talk to each other and helping to prevent the second driver from ramming into the first truck after a sudden stop.Josh Switkes, the company\u2019s chief executive, said that because Peloton\u2019s technology helps drivers get better at doing something they are familiar with, he thinks it can be quickly commercialized.\u201cOur basic approach is let\u2019s bring real value to the fleet and society now,\u201d Mr. Switkes said.Given that trucks are likely to need drivers for some time, it\u2019s no wonder that self-driving companies are almost universally pitching themselves as a friendly partner instead of a job killer. \u201cYou increase productivity, but also make the job more attractive,\u201d Mr. Rodrigues said.And it\u2019s true: Trucking is a brutal job. Drivers endure long, tedious stretches where they are inactive but have to stay focused, and they spend weeks at a time away from home. For those and other reasons, the industry\u2019s biggest problem has been the scarcity and turnover of drivers, making it hard to keep up with shipping demand.\u201cWe see this as a solution to the driver shortage and being able to redeploy them to the jobs they actually want,\u201d said Chris Nordh, senior director of advanced vehicle technologies at Ryder.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that trucking will shed about 300,000 jobs per year \u2014 starting in 25 years. Clearly, that estimate is based on so many ifs that the precise number is not worth fretting over. The bigger point is that as technology gets better, it will start replacing jobs.When Amazon went public in 1997, there wasn\u2019t much worry about huge job losses. Today, online retail companies require about one employee per $1 million of annual sales, versus 3.5 employees per $1 million at physical stores \u2014 a big reason that retail employment is falling by about 100,000 jobs per year, according to the Goldman report.As the saying goes, predictions are hard \u2014 especially about the future. But you can learn a lot by looking at today\u2019s bets. Mr. Fuller, from US Xpress, has a 38-year-old son named Craig.Last year Craig Fuller founded a company called TransRisk, which recently announced a $3.4 million venture capital investment. TransRisk logs millions of transactions and other market data to help trucking companies predict prices along with future supply and demand. Craig Fuller\u2019s bet is that as trucking becomes more automated, trucks will be in motion longer and routed by artificial-intelligence systems.As that happens, he said, the business will be reshuffled. Companies like his father\u2019s \u2014 which exist, more or less, to manage armies of drivers \u2014 will compete with data companies that specialize in managing computers.\u201cWhen you take away the driver and have a business that is completely based on analytics, very few fleets will be able to survive that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m betting on data and information services. He\u2019s betting on owning equipment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retailers Experiment With a New Philosophy: Smaller Is Better", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrick-and-mortar retail chains, known for sprawling stores that stock a bit of everything, are trying to lift sagging sales using a different strategy: cozier spaces that sell very little of anything.Showrooms \u2014 a retail model popular with bridal designers, car dealers and, recently, online apparel start-ups \u2014 are now inspiring mass-market heavyweights like Nordstrom and Urban Outfitters.In intimate salons, some the size of a cafe, shoppers can examine a limited selection of merchandise and place orders for products to be delivered or collected later. The customer service is often luxurious, but so is the time commitment for shoppers.This is the antithesis of the standard shopping mall experience, with the overwhelming assortment of products, the glazed apathy of part-time store workers, the disrobed patrons bellowing from fitting rooms for another size.\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to go to stores anymore; they have to want to go,\u201d said Lee Peterson, an executive vice president at WD Partners, a strategy, design and architecture firm. \u201cAnd that goes a long way when thinking about what retail has to become.\u201dNordstrom opened its first showroom-style store, called Nordstrom Local, on an upscale stretch of Melrose Place in Los Angeles last month.The 3,000-square-foot space \u2014 Nordstrom balks at calling it a showroom and instead refers to it as a concept store focused on service experiences \u2014 employs a handful of specialists. Ten minutes to the west of the location, hundreds of store associates roam a full-size, 122,000-square-foot Nordstrom department store.Nordstrom Local was designed as a kind of neighborhood hub, where customers can get manicures, have a shirt altered, pick up parcels purchased online or sip ros\u00e9 from the well-stocked bar. They do not come to shop \u2014 at least not in the traditional sense.The store has no inventory for sale, other than the occasional set of bejeweled boots exhibited on a shelf or the floral caftan hanging in the lounge.Customers work with personal stylists to put together ensembles, using tablets or phones. The outfits are usually requested from a nearby full-size Nordstrom store and delivered \u2014 sometimes within hours \u2014 for customers to try on amid the sleek settees in Local\u2019s dressing area.Without providing precise numbers, Nordstrom said shoppers had used the services thousands of times in Local\u2019s first four weeks.Some, like S. Y. Chen, 29, a graduate student in Los Angeles, stopped by out of curiosity.\u201cIt was like going to someone\u2019s room to hang out, not like going into a store at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI would use it if I was busier, but because I like to browse, I\u2019ll probably just keep going online or to a bigger store with more products.\u201dShowrooms are just another experiment.The rationale is simple: Instant gratification takes a back seat to visceral experience.More than half of millennials surveyed in recent years said that visiting showrooms could prompt them to make a purchase, according to the firm. The share of older shoppers who said this surged to 57 percent this year from 22 percent in 2015.By matching shoppers to the products they want and recording the preferences, showrooms can help limit the number of items that are returned, while encouraging repeat visits.They also require less storage space, which makes them more affordable to lease, especially in expensive urban areas. Inventory is centralized, dispatched only when ordered. Merchandise theft is minimal.Employee turnover, a costly problem at mall-based retailers, is lower in showroom-style stores, said Nadia Shouraboura, who founded the retail technology company Hointer.\u201cIt\u2019s just not pleasant to spend most of your time folding stuff, cleaning displays and having piles of products to maintain,\u201d said Ms. Shouraboura, a former executive at Amazon. \u201cShowrooms help the progression of a numbingly boring job into something more exciting, like being a stylist.\u201dThe showroom model could also alienate younger shoppers, who cherish the anonymity of online shopping, analysts said. Older consumers might enjoy the focused attention but want to be able to buy as well as browse.\u201cThis is just a slower, more expensive version of online,\u201d said Bob Phibbs, chief executive of The Retail Doctor, a consulting firm.Full-fledged showrooms can be a tricky endeavor for mall-based retailers, known for providing lower prices, higher volumes and impulse purchases. Many chains are exploring the model cautiously.Nordstrom has no immediate plans for another Nordstrom Local.Walmart said it was holding off on showrooms for its namesake stores. But in March it acquired Modcloth, a vintage-style e-commerce retailer with only one physical store, a showroom in Austin, Tex.Macy\u2019s tried a showroom of sorts in 2015 at its Manhattan Beach, Calif., store, where it swapped tightly packed racks of swimwear and athletics apparel for a narrower selection, displayed on mannequins. Shoppers used mobile devices to order items to try on, which would arrive in fitting rooms within seconds, delivered from storage via chutes cut into the walls, said Ms. Shouraboura, whose company, Hointer, worked on the effort.But Macy\u2019s, suffering a continuing sales slump and steadily shuttering stores, dismantled the project within a year, she said.The company envisions opening showrooms in Texas, California and elsewhere, said Michael Mai, a lawyer for the company.\u201cIt\u2019s a leaner system compared to general retail,\u201d he said.Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsuAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Embattled North Carolina Seeks to Outrun a Law\u2019s Bitter Legacy", "Date": "2017-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina wanted its reputation back.Worn down by about a year of battles and boycotts, its leaders cut a deal in March to repeal a law that had restricted restroom access for transgender people. But North Carolina is finding that it is easier to plunge into a culture war than it is to leave one behind.\u201cThis isn\u2019t like the Cold War where it came, it went, it was over and people didn\u2019t worry about it anymore,\u201d a longtime Republican strategist, Carter Wrenn, said.The day-to-day debate, Democrats and Republicans often note, has receded, and the national uproar that buffeted North Carolina beginning in March 2016 has largely abated. Still, a battered and weary state is slogging through a landscape of residual damage that some observers warn will not fade quickly.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like one of those hangovers you get in college that lasts for a few days,\u201d said Matt Hirschy, the interim executive director of Equality North Carolina, an advocacy group. \u201cUnfortunately for us, it\u2019s going to last for a few years, at least.\u201dIn a state where partisan rancor is a bipartisan pastime, people still marvel at how quickly and broadly H.B. 2, which required people in publicly owned buildings to use the restroom that corresponded with the gender listed on their birth certificate, reshaped perceptions of North Carolina.The law was championed by Republicans, who argued that it was crucial to public safety and a rebuff to an overreaching city government in Charlotte, and attracted some Democratic support.The national outrage ebbed anyway, business groups and convention planners appeared mostly satisfied, and the N.C.A.A. relented.But, in a signal of how North Carolina has so far been unable to outrun the law\u2019s legacy, political tensions flared again last month when Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, proposed a settlement in related litigation. As part of the deal, Mr. Cooper agreed to declare that \u201ctransgender people are not prevented from the use of public facilities in accordance with their gender identity.\u201dThe General Assembly\u2019s leading Republicans, who either declined to comment or did not respond to interview requests, swiftly condemned the proposal as \u201ca stunt\u201d that proved that Mr. Cooper \u201cacted in bad faith and lied about wanting to end the focus on H.B. 2.\u201d (A federal judge in Winston-Salem is considering the proposed settlement.)Indeed, Republicans contend that any lingering discussion about the law and its repercussions is driven only by transgender rights activists, their elected allies and the news media.\u201cMost of us, including me, would just as soon move on,\u201d Mr. McCrory added.Mr. Cooper, who said in March that the repeal legislation \u201ccannot be the only step,\u201d defended his decisions and said, \u201cThey set the fire, and I\u2019m working to put it out.\u201d\u201cI think most North Carolinians believe we are moving in the right direction, but many of them know we still have more work to do,\u201d said Mr. Cooper, whose actions last month were timed for the day before the deadline for proposals for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. \u201cBut I believe that North Carolina is a welcoming place and a great state to do business. We have taken enough important steps to signal to the world that we\u2019re open for business, and it\u2019s pretty clear that businesses are responding in a positive way.\u201dStrategists on both sides of the debate agree that voters have tired of talk about H.B. 2, but there is no consensus on how much the law will influence next year\u2019s elections.\u201cI find it highly unlikely that you will find the national money trying to make North Carolina a cultural battleground state at the legislative level,\u201d said Art Pope, a conservative financier who served in Mr. McCrory\u2019s administration.\u201cI think the volume has been turned down,\u201d Mr. Hirschy of Equality North Carolina said. \u201cThe fervor is still there in our community, and if you ask our opponents, their fervor is still there.\u201dPerhaps so, to the possible political benefit of both sides. An influential group of religious conservatives recently produced an advertisement complaining that a candidate for mayor of Charlotte \u201cendorsed a radical, national L.G.B.T. agenda allowing men in women\u2019s locker rooms and bathrooms.\u201d The election is Tuesday.But for many of the state\u2019s transgender residents, estimated at nearly 45,000 by a research institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, H.B. 2\u2019s repercussions do not play out on television screens. They are reflected, transgender people said, in quick decisions about whether to have a second cup of coffee and in choices about how much to share about themselves in conversation.\u201cBefore, whether or not you identified yourself as being transgender to someone was based on whether or not you perceived them as an ally or someone who would be O.K. with it,\u201d said Candis Cox, an activist who is a transgender woman. \u201cNow, what we have is a climate in which you really have a lot of trepidation about trusting people because we have now seen that people can seem to have all of the support in the world for you but have ulterior motives.\u201dAnd there is a measured sense that the fury of the H.B. 2 debate could someday be rekindled. On this matter, at least, there is some agreement.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a kind of holding of the breath,\u201d Ms. Cox said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now because we were dealt this awful blow, and it\u2019s waiting for the other shoe to drop. We don\u2019t know where we are. The people who supported H.B. 2 \u2014 the citizens, the politicians \u2014 we know that they\u2019re still there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jack Doroshow, 78, Drag Pageant Impresario, Dies", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJack Doroshow, who organized drag shows around the United States and presided over them as the drag queen Flawless Sabrina years before such performers found a measure of mainstream success, died on Nov. 18 in Manhattan. He was 78.His family said the cause was failure to thrive, a condition characterized by increasing frailty.Mr. Doroshow organized his first show in 1959 and produced many thereafter, working surreptitiously to avoid the morality police and sometimes the actual police, since some cities and states still had laws against cross-dressing.In his later decades Mr. Doroshow became an informal counselor and mentor to many of those in that culture, holding salons at his home on East 73rd Street in Manhattan. Flawless Sabrina was a mother or grandmother figure to those who visited there.\u201cShe basically said to me what I\u2019d heard many other people say over the years,\u201d he added, \u201cbut coming from her (perhaps because her tough love always felt more like an offering than a scolding, or perhaps because she was the embodiment of living an authentic artistic life) it made such clear sense, and I could see how the advice was something she herself was living. She said, \u2018You have to commit to yourself before other people will commit to you.\u2019 \u201dJack Allen Doroshow was born on Sept. 10, 1939, in Philadelphia. His father, Martin, was an antiques dealer who died when Jack was a boy. His mother was the former Eleanor Lynch.Diana Tourj\u00e9e, a staff writer at Vice who, with Ms. Drucker, had been helping Mr. Doroshow organize his archive, said that in the late 1950s, on a trip to Manhattan from Philadelphia, Mr. Doroshow and two friends were staying at the Sloane House Y.M.C.A. when two drag queens from Pittsburgh, who were also staying there, encouraged the three to come to a show they were part of \u2014 a new experience for Mr. Doroshow.Curiosity, Ms. Tourj\u00e9e said, was always one of Mr. Doroshow\u2019s defining traits, and he persuaded his two friends to give it a try, despite the steep-seeming $5 ticket price.\u201cWhat really amazed Jack,\u201d she said in a telephone interview, \u201cwas that there were so many people in this room and they all paid $5 to get into the show. So for him it started very much as a business venture.\u201dHe and his two friends staged a drag pageant in Philadelphia in 1959.So when Mr. Doroshow, now on his own, planned a second show in Pittsburgh using those Y.M.C.A. connections, he brought in Ty Bennett, a well-known drag performer at the 82 Club in New York, to host. The success of that event led Mr. Bennett to ask for a share of Mr. Doroshow\u2019s nascent business, but instead Mr. Doroshow decided that he could do his own hosting, and Flawless Sabrina was born.\u201cHe figured, \u2018I need to become some figure that can bring these pageants forward,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Tourj\u00e9e said, but not a queen who would pose a threat to the contestants. \u201cThe whole point of Flawless Sabrina was, she was supposed to be a noncompetitive mother,\u201d Ms. Tourj\u00e9e said. And so Mr. Doroshow, just 19 or 20, took on a late-middle-aged persona.He formed a company, the Nationals Academy, to produce pageants, tapping into a subculture in cities large and small and relying on word of mouth.Mr. Doroshow would sometimes be arrested on minor charges for his efforts, Ms. Tourj\u00e9e said, but he developed ways around that, striking deals with local leaders to make a charitable donation in exchange for a variance from any troublesome regulations. A certain amount of denial was involved in some locales, he said.\u201cIn the main,\u201d he said, \u201cthe city fathers thought it was a show we were bringing in from out of town. They didn\u2019t accept that it was people from the local area.\u201dIf some of his pageants were staged on the sly, the one featured in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d a film that Mr. Doroshow initiated and Frank Simon directed, was a flashy affair in Midtown Manhattan. The film documents a 1967 pageant featuring regional winners \u2014 Andy Warhol was among the judges \u2014 and is full of behind-the-scenes nuggets as the participants choose their clothes and hairstyles and talk about assorted topics, including the draft. One queen describes writing to President Lyndon B. Johnson after being rejected by his draft board, telling him that he had wanted to serve.\u201cI wanted to go not because I was a homosexual, because there were men there,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to help protect our country. It\u2019s as simple as that. So I got a letter back that stated that they understood and that they couldn\u2019t have me in the Army as of yet; maybe one day they\u2019ll see things right and I could get in.\u201dAfter being shown at the 1968 Cannes festival, which was cut short by the street protests and strikes throughout France that year, \u201cThe Queen\u201d went on to have a limited theatrical run to considerable acclaim, opening eyes. Renata Adler, writing in The Times, noted that society tended to marginalize and vilify the people the film depicted.\u201cBut the drag queens, flattening their vowels, mincing \u2014 parodying, not even women, but themselves parodying women \u2014 seem all right as they are,\u201d she wrote, \u201cpart of the American dream as defined by the narcissistic sex goddesses of old Hollywood.\u201dThe film, though, was not universally embraced by the population it depicted, Ms. Tourj\u00e9e and Ms. Drucker said. Some didn\u2019t like the exposure; others resented that Mr. Doroshow had created a successful business while they continued to struggle and hide.He is survived by his partner, Curtis Carman, whom he met in 1985; a half brother, Godfrey Diamond; and a half sister, Bambi Marksohn.Advertisement"}

His overall production deal with FX was canceled, and he lost his role as executive producer \u2013 as well as the compensation that came with that title \u2013 on the FX comedy shows \u201cBetter Things\u201d and \u201cBaskets,\u201d the Amazon series \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d and a TBS animated series, \u201cThe Cops.\u201dThe \u201cOne Mississippi\u201d star Tig Notaro, who had earlier criticized Louis C.K. for not addressing his behavior, said after learning of FX\u2019s decision, \u201cMy response is the lyrics to Johnny Nash\u2019s \u2018I Can See Clearly Now.\u2019 May the dark clouds continue to move.\u201dPamela Adlon, the star of \u201cBetter Things,\u201d which she created with Louis C.K., a frequent performer in his work (including his film \u201cI Love You, Daddy\u201d), said on Friday that she was troubled by Louis C.K.\u2019s admission. \u201cMy family and I are devastated and in shock after the admission of abhorrent behavior by my friend and partner, Louis C.K.,\u201d Ms. Adlon said in a statement. \u201cI feel deep sorrow and empathy for the women who have come forward.

{"Headline": "Grand Buildings Help Keep Macy\u2019s Afloat", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company\u2019s real estate is now worth more than its market value.The Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade is an indelible and durable holiday tradition. But the company that has sponsored the annual parade for nearly a century is being tested like the SpongeBob balloon in a strong wind. Battered by e-commerce competition, Macy\u2019s sales have fallen for 11 consecutive quarters, and its stock price has plunged about 41 percent this year alone.Shoppers and investors seem to agree that the magic of the department store has faded in this era of instant online gratification and free home delivery. It is not a fate unique to Macy\u2019s, as other bricks-and-mortar retailers scramble to adjust to the whims of American shoppers.What Macy\u2019s does have going for it is real estate \u2014 a vast network of more than 600 stores across the country. Macy\u2019s real estate, with an estimated value of $16 billion, is worth more than the company\u2019s market value of $6.4 billion, according to an analysis by Cowen, the investment management and banking firm. Many of its oldest stores are a developer\u2019s dream \u2014 soaring spaces with ornate exteriors in the heart of major American cities.\u201cBy any metric, there is a lot of value,\u201d said Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at Cowen.The Macy\u2019s flagship store on 34th Street is worth an estimated $3.3 billion alone. The company has no plans to sell its Manhattan flagship, a tourist magnet that contains more than one million square feet of retail space, and spent $400 million on renovating it between 2012 and 2016. Some analysts, though, say that what for many years was the \u201cworld\u2019s largest store\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be so large and have suggested that the company redevelop some of the upper floors. The passing of Macy\u2019s grand department stores into the hands of office and condominium developers reflects the tectonic shifts in the retail industry, where e-commerce has come to dominate a greater share of sales.Perhaps the most vivid marker of that change is the conversion of much of the Macy\u2019s store in downtown Seattle into offices.The new tenant will be Amazon \u2014 the very force that is pushing Macy\u2019s and other retailers to rethink the need for many of their stores. The e-commerce giant intends to move a variety of employees to 470,000 square feet of the Seattle building by next summer.Any redevelopment of the Marshall Field\u2019s is likely to be sensitive. The store features treasured spaces that hark back to the golden age of retail, like a Tiffany-designed vaulted ceiling and the Walnut Room restaurant.Amid discussion about downsizing the store, Macy\u2019s has been careful to note in a statement that \u201cdining in the restored Walnut Room, shopping beneath the Tiffany Dome and meeting under the Great Clocks remain treasured traditions for Chicagoans and visitors alike.\u201dWhile Macy\u2019s old urban buildings may hold much of their grandeur and value, the more difficult task may be figuring out how to pare its network of suburban stores.In January, the retailer named more than 60 stores it was closing \u2014 many of them in suburban malls, like the store in Alexandria, Va., which was sold this year. Over the long term, the Alexandria store will be part of a large commercial redevelopment. But over the next two years it will serve as a homeless shelter, with 60 beds. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "NBC Didn\u2019t Fire Matt Lauer. We Did.", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSocial media takes a lot of punches for enabling sexual harassment. But the past two months have shown that it has also provided consumers with an unprecedented power to make their market preferences heard loud and clear. And right now, the market is demanding that companies do something about sexual predators and pests in their midsts. The firing of Matt Lauer \u2014 the \u201cToday\u201d show star who reportedly commanded a salary of $25 million per year \u2014 by NBC News is just the latest example of a company moving swiftly to protect its brand in the face of sexual misconduct allegations.The obvious take here is that the chairman of NBC News, Andrew Lack, made a cold economic calculation: Mr. Lauer might have been a rainmaker for the network, but keeping him on was no longer worth it in the face of potential lawsuits, damage to the brand and lower ratings.But there\u2019s another, more positive, takeaway from Mr. Lauer\u2019s firing, which is that corporations are susceptible to the moral suasion of the public. This might not look like what millennials imagine when they talk about \u201ccorporate social responsibility\u201d and \u201cethical capitalism,\u201d but it\u2019s hard not to see it that way.\u201cEverybody knew\u201d is the stomach-churning line we have heard about so many men revealed as serial sexual offenders in the workplace. And yet they held on to their cushy jobs for years. What changed? Companies like NBC, HBO, Netflix, CBS and the Weinstein Company are more vulnerable to our outrage than ever before.At this point, the list of executives, entertainment legends and media darlings dumped by their companies includes dozens of men, including the longtime news host Charlie Rose, the comedians Andy Dick and Louis C. K., the actors Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Piven, the Amazon Studios executive Roy Price, and the journalists Mark Halperin and Leon Wieseltier. The director Bret Ratner even saw his Hillhaven Lodge whiskey line canceled by the company Diageo after sexual-harassment accusations were made against him.We\u2019re rightfully concerned about how the internet gives corporations more opportunities to exert power over consumers, but we talk far less about the flip side: We have more power over companies now, too. For better or worse, we\u2019ve all become remarkably effective at mobilizing it to our own causes.In contrast, look at Washington. If either Representative John Conyers Jr. or Senator Al Franken were in today\u2019s corporate world, they\u2019d be long gone. And just imagine if Roy Moore was a candidate for a C-suite job this month. He\u2019d have no shot.Instead, at least so far, these politicians have been protected, and whatever happens to them, it\u2019s clear that the political system is structured to insulate men like them from the consequences of their actions and keep their accusers quiet.The same people who often wax poetic about women\u2019s rights, gender discrimination and consent have moved quickly to protect their own. Just check out Nancy Pelosi\u2019s comments concerning Mr. Conyers, whom she praised as an \u201cicon\u201d who had \u201cdone a great deal to protect women\u201d while flip-flopping on whether she believed those accusing him \u2014 something she has seldom had trouble making a quick judgment about when Republicans are involved.Character may no longer count in politics and public service \u2014 if it ever did \u2014 but it matters more than ever in the private sector, where consumer preferences prevail.The modern American capitalist system is far from perfect. But for all its flaws, our system \u2014 and the digital communication channels it enabled \u2014 has delivered social justice more swiftly and effectively than supposedly more enlightened public bodies tend to.As we observe and adjust to the sociosexual storm we\u2019re all in, let\u2019s appreciate the powers and paradigms making it possible: feminism, but also free markets.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sessions Avoids AT&T Talk, G.O.P. Merges Taxes and Health Insurance: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday afternoon. An analyst at Goldman Sachs just published a research note putting the odds of Republicans changing the tax code at more than 80 percent. But Republicans in the Senate have added a wrinkle: repealing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate at the same time. More on that in a moment.Remember that a White House spokesman previously told the NYT, \u201cThe President did not speak with the Attorney General about this matter, and no White House official was authorized to speak with the Department of Justice on this matter.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London.____________________________From a note just published by Alec Phillips, a political economist at the firm:The tax reform debate is moving forward faster than we or most other observers expected. While there are a number of issues that could still slow it down, or stop it altogether, we believe the odds that tax reform will be enacted by early 2018 \u2014 already our base case \u2014 have risen to 80% (from 65% previously).He added that there\u2019s a one-in-three chance of a tax change becoming law by the end of the year, though the House and Senate may need time to reconcile their bills.While Mr. Phillips thinks that Republicans\u2019 tax efforts still face obstacles, including intense lobbying efforts and questions about whether the Senate can pass its bill, he believes that the overall campaign will succeed.Among some of Mr. Phillips\u2019 other predictions:\u2022 The corporate tax rate appears likely to go down to 20 percent, but may need to be phased in.\u2022 Limits on deductions for corporate interest payments should follow the more lenient prescription set out in the House bill.\u2022 Fewer Republicans than expected will ultimately push back against limits on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT in Congressional parlance.\u2014 MichaelSenator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, had pushed for the mandate to be eliminated as part of the tax bill. Here\u2019s what he had to say:\u201cRepealing the mandate pays for more tax cuts for working families and protects them from being fined by the I.R.S. for not being able to afford insurance that Obamacare made unaffordable in the first place.\u201dMr. El-Erian has the qualifications: former C.E.O. of Pimco, currently chief economic adviser at Allianz. But he\u2019s also what some of President Trump\u2019s backers would consider a \u201cglobalist,\u201d from his international upbringing as the son of an Egyptian diplomat to his economic views, which generally mesh well with the departing Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen.President Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve is a very wise decision that will be welcomed by markets. It brings a highly respected, well-informed and experienced professional to the helm of the world\u2019s most powerful central bank.\u2014 MichaelThe S.E.C. filed a total of 62 new enforcement actions against public companies and their subsidiaries in the fiscal year, down from 92 the previous fiscal year.Of the 62 actions, only 17 were brought in the second half of the year.Trian Partners probably wishes you didn\u2019t.At the time Trian published its analysis, G.E. was trading at $25.47. It predicted that by around this time, the conglomerate could get up to $40 to $45 a share. (To be fair, the activist had a laundry list of recommendations that G.E. follow, and the company hasn\u2019t implemented all of them. Who knows whether sticking to Trian\u2019s plan would have avoided this?)As of early this afternoon, the company\u2019s stock price was at $17.50, down 8 percent for the day.\u2014 MichaelSome start-up employees could owe big tax bills without being able to pay, since privately held companies\u2019 shares are generally harder to sell. Bigger unicorns could draw money from outside investors to let employees cash out \u2014 Uber already has \u2014 but younger start-ups have no such recourse.Companies could pay more cash compensation, using up precious cash flow. Or they could go public \u2014 if they make it that far. Tech employees might forgo working at younger companies because they couldn\u2019t pay as much. \u201cWe legitimately can\u2019t figure out how this is going to work,\u201d one start-up adviser told DealBook\u2019s Michael J. de la Merced.\u201cIt would mean that I would have to sell the company,\u201d said Shoaib Makani, founder and chief executive of long-haul trucking start-up KeepTruckin. \u201cI have zero net worth aside from the common stock I hold in the company. It would be impossible. I would be in default.\u201dTying into themes touched on in our conference last week, here are some of the ways businesses are trying to future-proof themselves:Just look at G.E.\u2019s stock performance yesterday, after the company unveiled its big turnaround plan and dividend cut:\u201cIf that is all you were going to say, why did we have to wait from July until November?\u201dCritics\u2019 corner\u201cI think that every major technology company has to be concerned right now. We\u2019ve reached a tipping point,\u201d Kelly Dermody, a lawyer who is working on the cases against Microsoft and Google, told me.In other sexual harassment newsAmazon and other U.S. companies here, including Apple Inc., have faced increased pressure in recent months in the face of the Chinese government\u2019s desire to control cyberspace. In July, Apple said it would begin storing cloud data for its Chinese customers on a server run by a government-owned company, to comply with Chinese law.Think about the implications \u2014 in health, in policy and in business \u2014 of the newly F.D.A.-approved digital pill, which has a sensor that can tell doctors whether, and when, patients take their medicine.The technology could potentially be used to monitor whether post-surgical patients took too much opioid medication or clinical trial participants correctly took drugs being tested.Insurers might eventually give patients incentives to use them, like discounts on co-payments, said Dr. Eric Topol, director of Scripps Translational Science Institute, adding that ethical issues could arise if the technology was \u201cso much incentivized that it\u2019s almost is like coercion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Silicon Valley Gets \u2018Crazy,\u2019 Midwest Beckons Tech Investors", "Date": "2017-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey are by no means the only notable investors seeking opportunity in the region.Four years ago, Mark Kvamme, a top venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, left the heart of the tech industry to become a tech investor here in the Midwest heartland.\u201cSilicon Valley is kind of crazy now,\u201d Mr. Kvamme said.The money, power and influence of tech companies on the West Coast have reached new heights. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are now the four most valuable companies in the country.But some investors, led by people like Mr. Kvamme and his firm, Drive Capital, see plenty of potential in the center of the country. Focusing on the Midwest is no longer considered a nutty idea, as it was by skeptical West Coast venture capitalists when Mr. Kvamme and Chris Olsen, another Silicon Valley transplant from Sequoia Capital and co-founder of Drive Capital, made the move in 2013.Every major Midwestern city now has clusters of start-up accelerators and incubators, typically housed in renovated red-brick industrial buildings.Deals like those are still rare. But local entrepreneurs and big investors are scouting the Midwest for start-up investments that range up to tens of millions of dollars, far more than local angel and venture investors. And they are beginning to attract venture capital from Silicon Valley for follow-on rounds of funding.The rationale for investing in the Midwest combines cost and opportunity. A top-flight software engineer who is paid $100,000 a year in the Midwest might well command $200,000 or more in the Bay Area. The Midwest, the optimists say, also has ample tech talent, with excellent engineers coming out of major state and private universities in the region.But they also point to technology shifts. As technology transforms nontech industries like health care, agriculture, transportation, finance and manufacturing, the Midwest investors argue that being close to customers will be more important than being close to the wellspring of technology.\u201cThe value will come from marrying industry knowledge with technology,\u201d said Mr. Olsen of Drive Capital. \u201cThere\u2019s an arrogance in Silicon Valley that we don\u2019t need industry expertise. That\u2019s going to be less and less true in the future.\u201d\u201cThere are two Americas,\u201d Mr. Case said. \u201cOne with an abundance of capital and opportunity \u2014 in Silicon Valley and pockets around the nation. But not in the other America, and that other America is most of the country.\u201dMr. Case served on White House advisory councils on jobs, innovation and entrepreneurship during the Obama administration, and that experience, he said, shaped his thinking about investing in the Midwest. Since 2011, his firm has raised more than $1 billion for two funds, Revolution Ventures and Revolution Growth, which generally make investments of $4 million to $50 million, including in start-ups in the Midwest.Both Mr. Case and Mr. Vance, whose career path went through the Marines, Ohio State University and Yale Law School and then to a Silicon Valley venture firm, view building businesses as a social virtue as well.Referring to the troubles chronicled in his book, Mr. Vance said that \u201cat least a partial solution is to get more investment capital into this part of the country.\u201dThe firm also sponsors road trips in a colorfully painted bus that it calls Rise of the Rest, also the name of Revolution\u2019s new $100 million investment fund. Mr. Case and members of his team leave Revolution\u2019s base in Washington, D.C., to visit and champion emerging start-up communities in cities across the country. Since 2014, there have been six such tours, and the most recent one ended last month after stops in central Pennsylvania; Ann Arbor, Mich.; Indianapolis; Columbus; and Green Bay, Wis.The days are packed with meetings with local entrepreneurs, investors, corporate executives, government officials, educators and social service workers. Each day ends with a pitch contest, where eight to 10 start-ups present their companies and business plans.The winner in each city receives a check for $100,000, a personal investment from Mr. Case. So far, he has handed out more than $4 million in the local contests.The day in Columbus was typical. There were seven stops, including three start-up hubs, with Mr. Case and Mr. Vance listening and speaking at each location.Mr. Case and Mr. Vance talk of the need to create \u201cnetwork density\u201d by bringing together more entrepreneurs, customers, partners and investment capital. The trips can and do yield investment candidates for Revolution, but start-up evangelism is the main theme.In Ohio, that $35 million is the equivalent of $70 million in the Valley in terms of being able to hire talent and sustain operating costs, said Sean Lane, CrossChx\u2019s co-founder and chief executive.\u201cI\u2019m not sure we would have made it through the zigs and zags if we were in the Valley,\u201d Mr. Lane said.CrossChx is one of more than two dozen companies in Drive Capital\u2019s portfolio. To date, none have folded, and they are generating more than $150 million in revenue. After three years \u2014 its first fund started investing in 2014 \u2014 the firm\u2019s gains look good on paper. But it is too early to declare its Midwest bet a success.That will take a few more years, and the proof will be if it delivers high returns to its limited-partner investors. \u201cAnd if two guys from Silicon Valley and Sequoia can\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Olsen said, \u201ccapital isn\u2019t going to come here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teaching Jane Austen With The New York Times: A Celebration of Her Work, 200 Years After Her Death", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBelow, a few ideas for teaching and learning with the many recent Times pieces celebrating her life and work, followed by links to many more._________What traits make Austen special, and can they be measured with data? Can literary genius be graphed?\u2026 the peculiar brilliance of Austen lies partly in what she focuses on, and what she ignores.Scarce or absent were big, dramatic things: war, elopement, murder, highwaymen, kidnapping, ghosts, gambling, shipwrecks, pirates. Instead we have families, letters, visiting, gossip, carriages, tea, dances, conversations, thoughts, emotions. We are left with daily, ordinary life, a focus on states of mind, thoughts and feelings \u2014 and efforts to understand others\u2019.And word choice can show this.To reduce words to data points is not to diminish the power of choosing the right ones and putting them in the right order; there\u2019s magic in fiction\u2019s ability to explore universal human truths. But a discipline like statistics can offer a new and amusing \u2014 even instructive \u2014 look at something as intuitive and artistic as a novel, and that\u2019s exciting, too. A new source of enjoyment, as Henry Tilney might have put it, and we must agree that it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible.How do \u201cthese distinctive words, word clusters and grammatical constructions highlight her writerly preoccupations: states of mind and feeling, her characters\u2019 unceasing efforts to understand themselves and other people\u201d? How do they show her \u201cacute emotional intelligence\u201d?_________What are the rules, written and unwritten, that govern courtship, love and marriage in Jane Austen?What are the rules, written and unwritten, that govern courtship, love and marriage today?Have students work in groups to make lists, providing evidence from the novels for each Austen entry.Then, have them compare the two. How many of the rules are exactly the same? How many today could be considered updated versions of something on their Austen list? What conclusions can they draw about how much courtship, love and marriage has changed in two centuries?Invite them to use any of these pieces to revisit their list of the rules that govern love, courtship and marriage today. What would they add? Which of the \u201cModern Love\u201d pieces provide evidence for something listed previously? Does anything they read or see in that forum remind them of something in the Austen novel they are reading? How?As a final challenge, you might invite students to write 13-word love stories from the point of view of any Austen character of their choice. Post them around the room or read them aloud and see if the class can guess which character is speaking in each._________Great novels keep on giving: No matter our age or circumstance, every time we read or reread them, they allow us to see ourselves and our world reflected anew.Even when the wily or wicked mar Austen\u2019s universe, they do not prevail. Like the grounds at Pemberley, an inherent order shapes the physical and moral landscape. Nature is tamed, and human nature too. Wickham is brought low, even though he has corrupted Lydia. Elizabeth may have been duped, but she sees clearly by the end.It is that dollop of wisdom that elevates Austen from a simple comedy of manners. It\u2019s not too heavy-handed or even, I concede, that profound. But pure beach reading wouldn\u2019t have comforted me. I wanted escape, but I needed moral resonance. For as delightful as Austen\u2019s static world may be, it is the humbling, bracing confrontation with the self that lifts her characters beyond caricature and her plots beyond Harlequin romance.This was Emma\u2019s vocation as well as mine: To fill in the blanks in our parents\u2019 abstract reasoning, to offer reassurance in the face of anxiety and confusion, and to help orient them when they felt disoriented. I began a dialogue in my mind in which I used what I learned about Alzheimer\u2019s to deepen my understanding of the novel, and Emma\u2019s behavior to instruct me on caregiving._________In addition to reflecting how women\u2019s economic autonomy creates freedom in other areas of their lives, Emma Woodhouse is a powerful example of a woman who puts herself first, placing a greater value on her needs and desires than on those of many of the men around her. Embedded within Austen\u2019s comedy of manners is the subtle but sustained assertion that women should concentrate less on whether they are worthy of a potential suitor and more on whether a potential suitor is worthy of them._________Is a Jane Austen a safe, \u201cladylike\u201d author removed from the rough and tumble of politics? Or, are her novels \u201cblueprints for a white nationalist \u2018ethno-state\u2019\u201d?In the 1993 book \u201cCulture and Imperialism,\u201d the Palestinian-American literary critic Edward W. Said argued that Austen\u2019s novel \u201cMansfield Park\u201d glorifies the grand estates of England but is silent about the West Indian slave plantations that supported many of them.But last year, in \u201cJane Austen, the Secret Radical,\u201d the British scholar Helena Kelly argued that the novel was larded with subtle references to abolition and the Church of England\u2019s complicity in slavery that no reader of Austen\u2019s time would have missed.Ms. Wells said scholars teaching Austen at schools with \u201csubstantially multicultural students\u201d still wrestled with a truth that must, perhaps, be uncomfortably acknowledged.\u201cHer characters are white, and her world is white,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you do with that?\u201dAsk students: Given some of the arguments raised in these pieces, should Austen still be taught in high schools? Invite them to debate the question, and to find evidence for their arguments in the novels themselves._______Jane Austen hasn\u2019t written a new book in 200 years, but that hasn\u2019t stopped anyone from trying to resurrect, recast and reimagine her old ones. \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d in particular, has enjoyed a full and occasionally wacko afterlife. It\u2019s been a Bollywood extravaganza (\u201cBride & Prejudice\u201d), an undead-themed novelty novel (\u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies\u201d), a frothy homage (\u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary\u201d) and, best of all, a BBC mini-series that established the universal truth that a billowy poet\u2019s blouse is one hot garment on a man, if the blouse is wet and the man is Colin Firth.The setting is Bronson Alcott High School, which is not this film\u2019s only nod to the classics. Some of \u201cClueless\u201d is actually lifted from Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cEmma,\u201d with Cher a mind-bendingly up-to-date version of the novel\u2019s matchmaking minx. Ms. Heckerling (who also wrote the film) deserves extra credit for doing that homework, but some of the modified Austen situations become a little improbable here. That\u2019s to be expected when characters who once paid endless polite visits to one another\u2019s country houses are now conducting business at the dinner table with their cellular phones.Do they agree? Are the Austen scenes \u201cimprobable\u201d? Does the essence of the novel and its characters come through anyway? How \u201cupdateable\u201d is Jane Austen in general, in their view?In fact, \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d may already be a zombie novel, contends Brad Pasanek, a specialist in 18th-century literature at the University of Virginia.\u201cThe characters other than the protagonist are so often surrounded by people who aren\u2019t fully human, like machines that keep repeating the same things over and over again,\u201d Professor Pasanek said. \u201cAll those characters shuffling in and out of scenes, always frustrating the protagonists. It\u2019s a crowded but eerie landscape. What\u2019s wrong with those people? They don\u2019t dance well but move in jerky fits. Oh, they are headed this way!\u201dAsk, How do authors and filmmakers take Austen\u2019s classic plots and characters and \u201cresurrect, recast and reimagine\u201d them? Which are most successful, in your view? How do you think Austen would react if she were to see or read them?Have students choose an Austen update to compare and contrast with the original, and write essays in which they decide how well it has recast the original\u2019s ideas, characters, themes, plot, setting, tone and language. Or, invite them to create their own adaptations._________\u2026 there were knowing murmurs when Mr. Mullan noted that the title character herself delivers one-fourth of the dialogue in \u201cEmma\u201d; that the sentences uttered by Mr. Collins, the puffed-up cousin in \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d are by far the longest of any Austen character; and that Isabella Thorpe uses the word \u201camazingly\u201d so much in \u201cNorthanger Abbey\u201d that the book\u2019s impressionable heroine, Catherine Morland, begins using it, too.I propose we get our noses out of Jane Austen. Not her books, her life. A victim of the most inane biographical rummaging at the best of times, Jane Austen is suffering unconscionable prying two centuries after her death. Where she lived, how she felt, how long her headaches lasted, whom she danced with, whom she loved, who loved her. Ask yourself which of her characters would interest themselves in tittle-tattle of this sort: Mr. Knightley or Mr. Collins, Fanny Price or Mary Crawford, Elizabeth Bennet or Lydia Bennet.\u2026 Perhaps it\u2019s in order to refuse the stern admonitions of her novels that we choose to call her \u201cJane,\u201d hoping the familiarity will rub off on the act of reading her. But there\u2019s more than a little sexism in the condescension. We don\u2019t call Charles Dickens, Charles; Joseph Conrad, Joseph; or Franz Kafka, Franz.I am exactly the obsessive \u201cJaneite\u201d Howard Jacobson criticizes in this article. When I see a headline touting Jane Austen\u2019s name, I click on it faster than an Amazon shopper on Black Friday, eager to learn about the author\u2019s life. While Jacobson calls for readers to stop personalizing Austen, I believe we can connect to the author and respect her legacy. Unlike other writers, Austen strayed from the pattern of swashbuckling knights and heroes to write about normal life. Readers dig into her past because her writing subject invites inquiry. We ask, why did she choose naturalism over fantasy? Did the pressure of gender stereotypes catapult her literary career?Ask your students who they think is right. Does an author and her life belong to admiring readers to personalize, or should Jane Austen, \u201ca novelist of unfamiliar and uncomfortable genius,\u201d be offered the respect of distance? Is it sexism that allows us to feel so close to \u201cJane\u201d?Finally, we suggest the following activities \u2014 even if they might be considered, by some, an \u201cindignity.\u201d_________Times Topics Page | Jane AustenIt\u2019s All an Allusion: Identifying Allusions, in Literature and in LifeGood Intentions: Taking a Cognitive Approach to Literature and StoriesThe Plot Thickens?

{"Headline": "Luxury in a Turbulent World: What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2017-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat\u2019s next?There are more than 20 books on Amazon with those two words in the title (and subtitles like \u201cBritain\u2019s Future in Europe,\u201d \u201cCreativity in the Age of Entertainment,\u201d \u201cDispatches on the Future of Science\u201d and \u201cThe Smart Nurse\u2019s Guide to Your Dream Job\u201d).They are, in other words, two words that act as shorthand for the bundle of anticipation, expectation and disruption that is our understanding of the future.But when it comes to luxury, once upon a time they also had a very specific meaning. They encapsulated the driving force of creativity: the constant quest for new ways of seeing, new ways of working, new ways of crafting and expressing identity, new ways of being relevant in the world. They were the causal root of trends, and they paved catwalks; they were the subtext of seasons, and the theory behind thinking six months in the future.Ask designers what they are thinking about when they begin collections, for example, and the answers come back as variations of \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d. What fabric, what color, what silhouette, what hem length? What movie or book or television series that captures the popular imagination and changes how consumers want to dress? When we talk about the \u201czeitgeist\u201d and \u201cdirectional items,\u201d that\u2019s what we mean. Luxury is an exercise in projection, and a guess about what\u2019s next. There is always risk involved, but to opt out of the game is to relinquish the urgency that hooks consumers.So what\u2019s new about that? (To change it up a bit.)The fact that over the last few years \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d has also begun to mean something more in the fashion world. It has become a stand-in for the constant need for newness driven by technology and 24-hour communication; a nod to the need to speed deliveries and communications, to systematically rethink the interface between customer and company. What and when are the next product drops? The next Instagram story or newsletter?And coloring it all is the macro meaning: the groan with which people greet every news alert on their phones, the feeling of nauseous anticipation that arises upon every new headline. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d meant in reference to the seemingly unpredictable course of global events: What new natural disaster is about to hit; what unexpected political event will unfold; what tweet will send ripples around the globe? What will fall from the sky to unsettle the consumer, disrupt exchange rates and demand new corporate strategy?Because these many layers of meaning cannot be disaggregated. People do not make purchases in a vacuum.They buy because they want to feel better, or they don\u2019t buy because they are scared; or they do buy because exchange rates have fallen and suddenly everything is cheaper, or they don\u2019t buy because it is more expensive; or they do buy because, well, time to make hay while the sun shines (or before the bombs fall), or they don\u2019t buy because what they see seems irrelevant to their lives. What happens next in the world changes what needs to come next in luxury. And the tension between those poles is what defines decision-making today.So we asked a series of decision-makers to tell us \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d Here are their answers.The luxury landscape has been changing for quite a while now and the element that has become most apparent is how it has gone from a brand-driven industry to a product-driven one. Brands can no longer rely solely on their image, positioning and status: this means that the offer and the entire productivity chain (from how the products are conceived and produced to the way they are communicated and sold), needs to adapt and be consistent with these changes.Sustainability, flexibility, responsibility, quality and engagement will be even more important than they are today. They will determine the success of a company in ways beyond what we already can foresee and, most importantly, they will give it the right language and attitude to connect to the new generation of luxury consumers.It is likely that others have more data and insight than I do about macro factors and industrywide challenges or focus. Although guided by my belief that surviving and thriving in the next few years cannot be by business-as-usual, my expertise is in leadership. And that will be the greatest challenge.So, which C.E.O.s and senior team direct reports will succeed and which will falter?1. Successful leaders will bring all their capacities to the playing field.\u2014 Those who falter will fail to challenge their own strongly held belief that is untrue or no longer true.\u2014 Those who falter will suffer a fear that drives avoidance of necessary actions or risk-taking and will let ego and emotion dwarf their own intuition.2. Successful ones will bring all the resources in their ecosystem to bear.\u2014 Those who falter will be afraid to delegate to capable subordinates, will react negatively to thoughtful pushback.\u2014 Those who falter will avoid engaging outside resources to help, claiming frugality or confidentiality.\u2014 Those who falter will have no external personal board of directors.3. Successful ones will stay focused on the end game.\u2014 Those who falter will get stuck in the details, overwhelmed, distracted by the \u201cshiny new object.\u201d\u2014 Those who falter will stay tactical and short term, preserving the status quo or past.\u2014 Those who falter will have an undisciplined involvement in nonstrategic activities, starving time from what only the C.E.O. can doWhether it is a coach, an outside mentor, a trusted H.R. chief, the only way humans become aware of these possibly temporary troubled mind-sets is to look in the mirror through someone else\u2019s lens.Building an environment that fosters excellence to its full potential across each company\u2019s department should remain the focus, while making sure we live in our era and stay relevant.Uncertain circumstances cannot affect a culture of excellence driven by talent, creativity and passion.These core values will keep fashion relevant as well as the obsession to guarantee an authentic experience.In a sense, luxury\u2019s greatest challenge is the same as it ever was: to be more and more relevant to customers and the way they lead their lives.Having said that, distinctions once critical to our engagement with customers seem less and less relevant. Lines between wholesale and direct-to-consumer trade, domestic and international business, physical and digital storefronts are increasingly blurred.In a crowded and transparent marketplace, we need to be constantly \u201ctop of mind\u201d with our customers without seeming ubiquitous. Given all this, our greatest new focus will be increased personalization and customization of everything from product to content.To engage with a brand in a uniquely personal way is the ultimate luxury.The world challenges include the climate, growing inequality, the aspiration for diversity, the rejection of a \u201cone size fits all\u201d global model, the re-emergence of identities, individualities, the aspiration for a more responsible consumption, the aspiration for a more feminine world.A more feminine world is a world which gives birth to new and beautiful ideas for sustainable growth, it is also a world which takes care of all individuals who feel disengaged.Therefore the luxury industry will continue to protect the welfare of all people participating in the creation, production and promotion of its products, will protect the environment while improving the traceability of its sourcing and will continue to pay attention to animal welfare. Finally, the role of the most accomplished brands will be to support and serve a larger community than just its clientele by encouraging the community towards a certain mission. Most brands carry missions which go beyond its products; e.g., Nike will encourage audacity, \u201cJust do it!\u201d Apple, simplicity and Chlo\u00e9, \u201c freedom to be oneself.\u201dBeyond a global rise in austerity and digital disruption, the key challenge facing luxury brands is how to keep up with the unprecedented pace of the ever-evolving new luxury consumer. Unlike the previous generation who was romanced by the store experience and stories of craftsmanship, today\u2019s consumer is turned off by the very word \u201cluxury.\u201d For them the term has connotations of elitism and exclusivity. Instead, they want a luxury that is inclusive, honest and democratic.For the new consumer, status is no longer about how much you can afford to spend on a good, but more about what you stand for and have achieved. They know how to acquire \u201cluxury-quality\u201d at a fraction of the price and seek to be entertained beyond the store and within the digital space. Their first point of contact with a brand is usually via the website or social media channel, which makes it imperative for brands to consider these channels as platforms for information and entertainment and not just commerce. They want brands to care about the values that are important to them such as sustainability.To keep ahead of this demand, luxury brands will have to focus on how best to enhance the digital experience. Will the advent of new technologies such as A.R. (augmented reality) create a new experience in personalization whereby the brand atelier can be brought into people\u2019s homes?Of great focus in the coming years will be the integration of luxury into everyday life, which will necessitate design inspired by function as well as beauty and craftsmanship. Further, with more understanding of the impact of our purchases \u2014 and in the case of luxury goods, the artisans who made them and the provenance of the materials \u2014 we\u2019ll need greater transparency and storytelling on how our products came to be. Finally, we\u2019ll see more and more personalization to reflect individual style, and a continued need to serve consumers seamlessly wherever they are.The history or the moment of luxury has always been turbulent.It has been turbulent for luxury to become an industry, and a very dynamic one, quite young still \u2014 more or less 40 years.It has been turbulent for luxury to become international.It has been turbulent for luxury to embrace many different products under the same \u201cumbrella\u201d (brands) and layers of clients (consumers).It is turbulent for luxury to cope with quantities, and now, as well, with different generations of people from different cultures.It is challenging to cope with confusion.Too many adjectives are tied to the word \u201cluxury\u201d: Accessible, ultimate, soft, hard \u2014 implying that most of luxury would be average?The simple word luxury itself is often misused (not to say mess-used) covering brands, products, or processes irrelevant to the necessary evolution of our society and our world.The challenge, though, is inspiring \u2014 and necessary in order to stay, or become, right.The answer is not to try to protect or come back to a better yesterday (which day?) nor to follow current trends where statements replace thinking and thoughts, where number of followers have more value than what you propose, or where thinking that \u201cdigital\u201d will be a new world, when in fact there is only one world.We must accept and value complexity, and take uncertainty as a teaser to do better.Luxury has all the means to be a major reference as soon as it really mixes, in a sustainable way, legacy, know how, innovation, creativity, quality, beauty, fun, the unexpected, in concrete products and offers, always with the sense of integrity (towards itself) and the sense of respect (towards others).The beauty is that it is not about size but about strength.Besides, there is not one recipe, but several paths.That is why solid brands exist with their intangible substance and a long-term view.In an increasingly fast-paced world with more transparency than ever before, the need for continuous innovation and authenticity is paramount. Brands will continually have to balance innovation with authenticity to their D.N.A., especially in a time of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. This tension has always been present but is magnified with the power and transparency afforded by technology.After many years of attempted focus on all things digital, brands are realizing that consumers demand differentiated experiences across channels and we will continue to see innovation in brick-and-mortar store experiences as well as product co-creation with consumers (personalization and customization) taken to new levels.In a turbulent world with a widening divide between the have and have-nots, sustainability in luxury will move from being a \u201cnice to have\u201d to a \u201cmust have.\u201dThe new luxury will create heirlooms of gratifying value while simultaneously sustaining long-term economic, equitable and ecological values.One of the industry\u2019s main challenges is undoubtedly the emergence of a new generation of consumers, with unique sets of behaviors and expectations. Millennials, who are accustomed to very high standards of end-to-end service in other industries, will soon become its most important cohort of luxury clients and will put pressure on the traditional models. These \u201cdigital natives\u201d consumers follow very different and fragmented decision journeys and are amassing more and more power relative to the brands. Yet, many luxury players fall short of offering them an enriched, personalized, seamless and digitally enabled experience able to conquer their hearts and minds.Through innovation and utmost personalization, brands must shape the 21st century luxury experience. They should leverage their unique assets and brand heritages but also reinvent their in-store experiences, with the help of new technology, and transpose them online. This calls for a complete shift of luxury brands\u2019 approach to emotionally engage with their customers, starting by using data to provide a tailor-made experience across all touchpoints.While intelligence in business and in the world at large has changed exponentially, let\u2019s never forget that brands are created by people for people. The game-changer will be when we look at what we can achieve collaboratively and collectively as much as we what we do individually. We are in a new Renaissance, and it\u2019s our responsibility to play a role in how business, culture, humanity and science come together as never before.The concept of luxury has been around for centuries, not only in physical products and experiences but also in people\u2019s dreams. Today, luxury is not just about price. It means different things to different people. For some, it\u2019s about having the best. For some, it\u2019s about having better. It\u2019s not enough for a brand to create a single definition of luxury \u2014 it has to be more democratic than that.Going forward, we won\u2019t be able to define the luxury consumer based simply on demographics and income. We have to understand them much more personally, so that we can engage with consumers that care about what the brand stands for.And then we need to combine our creativity and state-of-the-art technology to create highly personalized experiences and products that make people feel special. I think that\u2019s what luxury really is. A feeling that something is special.The luxury Goods industry will need to manage with the fact that more and more disposable spending is now being spent on experiences rather than goods, as the cupboards are full and the garages are full and the affluent would now rather buy unique, memorable experiences.Traditionally, sustainability and luxury were opposites. Our key purpose at Soneva since we opened our first resort back in 1995 has been to prove that they are not, and that luxury and sustainability go hand in hand. At Soneva, we manage to offer our guests luxuries whilst minimizing our impact on the planet and enhancing their health.It is very good to see that over the last 10 years, other companies have adopted a similar belief, such as Kering. It is also good to see such revolutionary concepts like Tesla, which is not just as comfortable as a Merc, a Jaguar or a BMW, but also zero carbon in its operation.As we start to feel the impact of global warming and other environmental issues, low-impact consumption will become more and more important, especially for luxury brands.Success will come to those that keep a fresh, strong vision in design. This will put more pressure on the most creative designers to constantly reinvent themselves without losing continuity from a past season. Mid-tier luxury brands could disappear. U.S. luxury in particular will struggle unless designers reinvent themselves. Houses with a portfolio of brands in various states of reinvention will have a better chance of surviving than mono-brands.Luxury brands will create unique experiences in the retail world to entice and engage customers. Authenticity will win over flash or the slick branding of the early 2000s, which is still evident in most retail stores. Values will matter in fashion and integrating those values into the product lines will be really important \u2014 think Stella McCartney\u2019s commitment to sustainable fashion or Alessandro Michele and Gucci\u2019s recent commitment to be fur-free. Fashion\u2019s influence on culture will grow stronger, not weaker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers Lured to Australia Find Low Pay and Tough Conditions", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIDCOMBE, Australia \u2014 Like many young South Koreans, Gabi Cho moved to Australia for the chance to learn English, breathe its famously clean air and make some money.Two years ago, she found a job cutting hair in the Lidcombe area of Sydney. It paid about $9 an hour. To get the job, she put down about $380, refundable if she was never late or absent from work.At the time, she said, she did not know all of that was illegal.Ms. Cho, who now contends that the salon underpaid her by up to $30,000, is one of thousands of temporary foreign workers in Australia who are chronically underpaid by their employers, according to a survey released on Tuesday. It adds to growing evidence that Australia is home to a large but silent underclass of migrant workers, many of them international students or simply adventurous backpackers, who are rarely heard from despite widespread labor abuses.\u201cThe owner exploited my lack of English, lack of knowledge of the law and work rights,\u201d Ms. Cho said through a translator. \u201cI want people to know what happened to me so it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else.\u201dThe survey comes amid a rising awareness of labor abuses among temporary workers in Australia. With its developed economy, healthy environment and tight job markets in many places, Australia looks appealing to those looking for a foothold to live there and to those who simply want to make some money while visiting.The survey released Tuesday, called Wage Theft in Australia, covers an estimated 900,000 migrants with the right to work here. It found that roughly a quarter of international students made less than 12 Australian dollars, or $9, per hour, and almost half made 15 Australian dollars or less.In Australia, the national minimum wage is 18.29 Australian dollars, or $13.84, per hour. Casual employees, who are not entitled to vacation or sick leave, typically make more.The worst paid jobs were in fruit and vegetable picking and farm work, according to the survey.Many of the workers knew they were being underpaid, the survey found. Because of their visa status, the authors said, they probably did not expect to receive the legal minimum wage.The authors, who worked with local migrant and worker groups, acknowledged flaws in the survey, which included about 4,300 workers and was translated into 12 languages other than English. It was conducted online, which could exclude some groups, and because it was anonymous it could be completed more than once. Participants were invited to apply for a drawing for a total of about $1,000 in Amazon gift cards.Still, its conclusions roughly match those of some Australian government officials. Young people and people from migrant backgrounds may be more susceptible to exploitation in the workplace, said Mark Lee, a spokesman from the Fair Work Ombudsman, an independent government agency that investigates workplace complaints and enforces labor law.He added that this was because of a variety of factors, including \u201clanguage barriers, lack of understanding of their workplace rights, limited knowledge of where to go for help and concerns over their visa status.\u201d\u201cThis is a big issue in Korea,\u201d said Ms. Cho\u2019s husband, Andy Rim, a South Korean national who works as a warehouse supervisor. \u201cThey\u2019re sending people overseas to work as slaves.\u201dMr. Rim said he and his wife came to Australia through an employment program supported by the South Korean government.Workers from Asian countries appeared particularly susceptible to tough labor conditions, the study suggested. Workers from Asian countries including China, Taiwan and Vietnam received lower wage rates than those from North America, Ireland and Britain, the survey found.Working in construction in the central business district in the city of Brisbane, Mr. Song said he was paid 15 Australian dollars per hour. More than a third of workers at his site are Chinese or Taiwanese and on working holiday or tourist visas.\u201cThe salary difference doesn\u2019t seem fair,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it makes sense, and I don\u2019t feel I have a choice.\u201dXiuzhong Xu contributed reporting from Melbourne, Australia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For the First Family of Pleasure Products, Toys Are Us", "Date": "2017-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Back in 1976, when Chad Braverman\u2019s father, Ron, invested a small grubstake in a manufacturing start-up, consumers bought his products at the back of seedy bookstores and scurried out with their purchases concealed in brown paper bags.The younger Mr. Braverman, who was not yet born, grew up ignorant of how his father actually made a living. He would be well into his teens before learning that the company his father ran with a partner was not, as he had long supposed, some sort of criminal enterprise.What Ronald A. Braverman did was make rubber penises. He also manufactured latex vaginas and hand-shaped items devised for anal insertion and a variety of other novelties associated with masturbatory pleasures. In the evolving parlance of successive eras, those items were euphemistically known first as marital aids \u2014 as though a vibrator were a couples counselor \u2014 and then sex toys and, eventually, \u201cpleasure products.\u201d\u201cSure, people used to joke about it,\u201d Chad said. \u201cDoes your dad really make rubber penises? But then by the time I was in college, it suddenly flipped, and it made me the coolest person around.\u201dOn a day of scorching heat and dry Santa Ana winds gusting over the mountains, the two of us sat in an air-conditioned office at the Doc Johnson headquarters in North Hollywood. Bearded and muscled, Mr. Braverman was clad in Acne jeans, a Buck Mason shirt and a pair of pink Common Products sneakers. Behind his desk a wall of bookshelves held the sports trophies he collects, among them signed Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Wilt Chamberlain basketballs.There is a certain accuracy in the characterization, since almost 75 percent of Doc Johnson products are manufactured in one of seven structures scattered across a sprawling 250,000-square-foot compound, and a \u201cMade in America\u201d emblem is a central element of the Doc Johnson marketing strategy.Here, in the industrial eastern part of the San Fernando Valley, hundreds of workers sculpture, mold, paint, pack and ship the 75,000 products Doc Johnson manufactures weekly. Here, employees in white coats and surgical caps blend six tons of raw material every day, pouring dildos and using air guns to pop each one out of its mold. Here, brass plaques hung in a lobby commemorate employment milestones by generations of mostly Hispanic employees who have raised families on wages earned fabricating devices like Doc Johnson\u2019s best-selling Sasha Grey Masturbator, a lifelike reproduction of the genitals of Ms. Grey, a onetime pornographic star, molded in a casting room on site.\u201cWe now look at what we\u2019re doing as being about creating an experience, like entertainment,\u201d Mr. Braverman said, adding that his company\u2019s trademarked new Kink by Doc Johnson line of products \u2014 rubber sheets, dog collars and assorted fetish gizmos \u2014 \u201cis really killing it.\u201dIf historically \u201cthere was not a lot of brand loyalty and brand awareness\u201d in the sex toy industry, as Mr. Braverman said, that is quickly being modified as manufacturers adapt to an increasingly savvy and fast-growing consumer base.\u201cThey were literally called \u2018What Do Women Want?\u2019\u2019\u2019 she said. It seemed, she said, that everyone, from chief executives to buyers for sex toy stores, was eager to discuss how to recalibrate a business that, as Ron Braverman explained, \u201chad gone from being 100 percent male dominated \u2014 male manufacturers, male bookstore owners, men going to select the product and bring it home \u2014 to being an absolutely female-oriented consumer product.\u201dAs abrupt as the shift seemed at the time, its origins were not altogether surprising. In her book, Ms. Comella argues that, absent the early feminist sex educators and entrepreneurs behind such enlightened sex toy shops as Good Vibrations in San Francisco, success would have been less probable for a mainstream manufacturer like Doc Johnson, whose products are now sold by 7,500 brick-and-mortar stores throughout the United States, on sex-oriented sites like PinkCherry and Lovehoney, and, increasingly, by mass-market retailers.Unwittingly or not, the \u201cfeminist trend of educating women about their bodies, about their clitorises, about vibrators as a tool of self-empowerment,\u201d Ms. Comella said, ultimately benefited the sex toy business by altering cultural perceptions of it and initiating its migration from XXX bookshops to Walmart, Amazon and Target.\u201cIt used to be, \u2018Gee, I\u2019m a man, why would you need any of that?\u2019\u201d Ms. Colvin said. \u201cNow it\u2019s the woman doing the consuming, and it\u2019s not so intimidating for a partner when she introduces a toy into a relationship.\u201dAs seemingly everywhere else in the culture, it is a millennial generation that is leading the charge in mainstream acceptance of a business few still associate with its back-alley beginnings.\u201cSometimes even people in the industry for decades don\u2019t realize how accepted sex toys now are,\u201d said Erica Braverman, the marketing director at Doc Johnson.Just six years separate the two Braverman siblings, and yet one grew up unaware of what the family business was, while the other went to college knowing that full, freaky disclosure was just a Google search away.\u201cWhen I went to college and told people I\u2019m in the family business, no one blinked an eye in a negative way,\u201d Ms. Braverman said. \u201cIt was more like, \u2018OMG, what about Christmas? My birthday is coming up. What am I going to get?\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Missy Elliott\u2019s song \u201cToyz\u201d was released.

{"Headline": "New York City\u2019s Ferry Fleet Is Off to a Fast Start", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a year of transit miseries, it has become an unexpected success story in New York City\u2019s commuting landscape \u2014 the city\u2019s nascent ferry fleet, whose ridership has far exceeded expectations, is rapidly becoming an alternative to the beleaguered subway system.Two of the four new ferry lines are already carrying more passengers than had been projected for 2019. The ferry service has proved so popular that the city has had to order bigger boats and there is already talk of creating express routes to zip workers to and from their jobs more quickly.Six months after Mayor Bill de Blasio started the most extensive ferry service New York has had in decades, it has carried more than 2.5 million passengers, about 700,000 more than had been expected.Though the number of people riding boats is tiny compared with the millions who squeeze onto the subway every day, the successful launch of the ferry system suggests that it could become a key part of the city\u2019s transportation network.\u201cThe mayor feels like this is one of the best things we\u2019ve done,\u201d Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen said.The city had been running a more modest subsidized ferry service on the East River before the de Blasio administration decided to lower the fare to match the subway\u2019s and expand the service to waterfront neighborhoods that the subway does not reach. The city\u2019s investment, which could exceed $325 million by 2023, is one of the most ambitious attempts to change the menu of commuting options in New York.Whether the city can afford to underwrite so much of the cost remains to be seen, but some riders, especially those who are refugees from the delay-plagued subway, have already become enamored regulars.\u201cEverybody loves it,\u201d said Kathleen Warnock, who since August has been riding sleek boats instead of packed subway trains between her home in Astoria, Queens, and her job in Lower Manhattan. \u201cThey\u2019re voting with their feet. This is the way they want to get to work.\u201dThe ferry service\u2019s robust growth has not come without problems \u2014 inspections by the Coast Guard revealed that a mechanical problem had caused pitting in the hulls of some boats. That problem, first reported by The New York Post, has taken six ferries out of service and Mr. de Blasio has ordered an investigation. Officials said the problems posed no safety risk and that the company that operates the ferry, not the city, would bear the repair costs. On Monday, a ferry ran aground as it left a pier in Manhattan though no one was hurt.Despite the setbacks, the demand for waterborne transportation is also fueling the expansion of commuter ferry service across the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey. New York Waterway, which operates several routes on the river, added service recently between Midtown Manhattan and Hoboken and Jersey City.Across the country, other cities, including Boston and New Orleans, are exploring ways of increasing passenger-ferry service as a way to improve transportation. Boston Harbor Now, a nonprofit, is studying how to add to the city\u2019s ferry network. The New Orleans Regional Transit Authority plans to expand service on the Mississippi River.Ms. Glen said New York\u2019s ferry service represented a strategic investment in improving transit options in neighborhoods across the city, especially those where a forest of high-rise towers have drawn new residents. Besides providing another option to an antiquated and unreliable subway, Ms. Glen said the ferry connections could breathe more life into some neighborhoods by spurring development.City officials promoted the ferry service as an enticement to Amazon in their bid to lure its second headquarters to the city, Ms. Glen said. She emphasized that NYC Ferry is not a typical point-to-point service but a system whose map looks more like that of a subway or railroad network, making multiple stops before reaching its final destination.The service is scheduled to expand next year, adding routes to Soundview in the Bronx and the Upper East Side of Manhattan, as well as the Lower East Side. But the operators are already considering going further, Ms. Glen said.Terry MacRae, the chief executive of Hornblower, a San Francisco-based company that operates the ferries, said the service might benefit from express boats that skip stops \u201clike an express train when you\u2019ve already got the milk run.\u201d At peak travel times, boats might run directly from one high-volume stop on a route, say Long Island City, to an endpoint like Pier 11 in Lower Manhattan.A key reason the ferry service has become so appealing is its low fare: $2.75 each way. While most ferry services are priced like luxury transportation alternatives, Mr. de Blasio insisted on pegging the cost to the fare for a single ride on the subway and city buses.As a result, however, the ferries are heavily subsidized. City officials estimate that the subsidy amounts to about $6.60 per rider, which would translate to about $16.5 million so far. (New York City already operates the far older Staten Island Ferry, which is free and connects Manhattan and Staten Island.)Starting the new service has proved more expensive than forecast, but city officials have not flinched at the rising cost. The city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation spent $30 million on the ferry service in the fiscal year that ended June 30.This summer, it had to charter additional boats, at a cost of $500,000, to handle large crowds on weekends. The surging popularity also spurred the city to order bigger boats, with a capacity of 349 passengers, instead of boats that could fit 149 riders, which the city originally had built. This month the Development Corporation\u2019s board approved the construction of three more of the bigger boats, for a total of six. It has 16 smaller boats.The city has an option to buy the boats from Hornblower and Hornblower has an option to demand that the city buy the boats. So no future mayor could easily or inexpensively eliminate the service.A future mayor could decide to raise fares to reduce the city\u2019s subsidy, but Ms. Glen said the current administration is committed to keeping the cost of the ferry in line with the base subway and bus fare.Any ferry service expansion will be less challenging than this spring\u2019s launch. Hornblower was having boats driven to New York as fast as two shipyards on the Gulf Coast could turn them out.\u201cWe\u2019ve scaled a steep mountain and we\u2019re still climbing,\u201d Mr. MacRae said.Indeed, NYC Ferry has still not moved into its permanent home at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The city is outfitting a pier there that will serve as the base of operations for the fleet and its crews. Cameron Clark, who runs the service for Hornblower, and his staff have had to operate out of a WeWork building on Wall Street, where they share work spaces with other tenants.While reviews from riders have been generally positive, there have been complaints about boats running late and being so full that they leave people behind. City officials said they hope to placate riders by next summer with a bigger fleet.Another way that ferry operators eased some of the unhappiness was by hiring people like Milton Scott. Mr. Scott, who lives in Brooklyn, was working for NYC Ferry\u2019s landlord in Lower Manhattan when Mr. Clark decided that Mr. Scott\u2019s flair for hospitality would be a good fit.Mr. Scott now works as a deckhand, spending days riding back and forth on the long run between Manhattan and the Rockaways. \u201cMy thing is to make people happy,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cWhen they get onto the vessel, they\u2019re looking to relax and decompress, which you\u2019re not able to do on the M.T.A., because of the crowds and the service disruptions.\u201dMs. Warnock, 57, was quick to abandon her daily ride on the N/W subway line for the comforts of the ferry, which lands several blocks from her home in Astoria.\u201cOh my gosh, this is a perfect commute,\u201d she said, waxing on about the sights along the water. \u201cIt\u2019s really improved my quality of life.\u201dFor Alexandra Stathis, who lives near the river in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the ferry provides a respite from the \u201ccrowded and stressful\u201d subway, in one direction at least.Ms. Stathis, 28, said she and her boyfriend ride the ferry to East 34th Street in Manhattan every morning. From there, she usually hops on a free NYC Ferry shuttle bus to get to her office. But in the evenings, she said, she usually rides the subway home.In comparison to the subway, she said, the ferry has been \u201cextremely pleasant\u201d and punctual.That sort of reaction reflects what Ms. Glen, the deputy mayor, calls the \u201chappiness factor\u201d the ferries have produced. \u201cWe have qualitatively changed people\u2019s transit experiences,\u201d she said.But she admitted that there was one review of the ferry service that was especially satisfying.

{"Headline": "5 Lessons Seattle Can Teach Other Cities About Amazon", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon, the colossus of internet commerce that was founded here, is conducting the most dramatic sweepstakes of modern capitalism in throwing open a competition for a coequal second headquarters. The company has promised to create about 50,000 new jobs at HQ2, as Amazon is calling it, paralleling the similar number the company plans to employ here over the next couple of years.Six-figure salaries, real-estate investments and economic ripple effects \u2014 from health care for all those new workers to the hash browns being served for breakfast \u2014 could inject $50 billion or more into the winning town, economists say. Proposals from 43 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, as well as Canada and Mexico, are now being considered, with a decision scheduled for sometime next year.For Seattle, Amazon has become far more than a big employer and taxpayer. It reshaped how the city sees itself and, in turn, is seen by the world. It created a vast, gleaming new campus in a once derelict corner of the city, but also raised deep concerns about housing costs, traffic congestion and potential over-dependence on one corporation.In interviews with experts and residents, from tech company offices to chambers of commerce, here are the lessons from Seattle for all those cities now seeking the Amazon prize.The second Amazon headquarters will unquestionably have a major impact on whichever city gets the nod. But Amazon did not start from scratch.A collective corporate cultural ethos had been built as well by other companies that arose from a city of working waterfronts and gloomy skies. REI, Eddie Bauer, Starbucks, Nordstrom and Costco \u2014 not to mention Microsoft and Boeing \u2014 shaped the economic rootstock that Amazon grew from, and created an assumption by many Seattle residents that corporations should be involved in the community as civic leaders.\u201cThere isn\u2019t an obvious candidate where they\u2019re going to get the same confluence of features,\u201d said Fred H. Smith, a professor of urban economic history at Davidson College in North Carolina, who has evaluated the bid by his state\u2019s leading HQ2 contender, Charlotte.Seattle hit a sweet spot with the company\u2019s rise, Professor Smith said, as Amazon tapped into an existing rich pool of talent and resources, from the University of Washington\u2019s strengths in computer science, to cheap electricity from the Pacific Northwest\u2019s connections to hydropower dams in the Columbia River basin.\u201cFinding a city that has all of those things is a tough goal,\u201d he said.A company that started out selling books became one of the inventors of cloud computing as a business, selling not just goods but the invisible machinery of internet commerce itself. It has leapt into the grocery business with the recent acquisition of Whole Foods. It made a decision that employees could bring their dogs to work, and on any given day, about 1,200 pets are roaming the 33 buildings of the urban campus in the South Lake Union area.The message to HQ2 cities is clear: What you get now will probably not be what Amazon becomes.Change and churn have become part of the Amazon brand, and thus the Seattle brand, business people said. In the past seven years, coinciding with Amazon\u2019s biggest growth spurt, the number of Fortune 500 companies with an office in Seattle quadrupled, to 31 from seven, many of them hunkering down as closely as they can to Amazon.\u201cThere\u2019s an ecosystem that has been really enhanced because of Amazon,\u201d said Josh Simms, the chief executive of H5 Data Centers, a company based in Los Angeles that provides space for cloud-computing companies. \u201cAmazon brought a lot of young, smart people into Seattle, so now all the big tech companies feel they need to be there as well,\u201d he said.Critics still complain that Amazon is not involved enough as a corporate citizen. But one of the company\u2019s new office buildings will have a shelter for 200 homeless women, children and families built into the tower itself \u2014 the first such design in the world, company officials said.\u201cI still look at Amazon as a young company, a teenager,\u201d said Maud Daudon, the president of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThey\u2019re on a path.\u201dIn Seattle, the company\u2019s growth became the catalyst for forces of anti-growth as housing prices soared and traffic worsened. The nation\u2019s first big-city $15-an-hour wage was passed here as Amazon rose. Home prices have risen faster in recent years than in any place in America.\u201cAmazon is simultaneously one of the most loved and most hated of organizations. It\u2019s this incredibly schizophrenic relationship,\u201d said David Rolf, the president of the Service Employees International Union 775, which represents 45,000 health care workers.Defenders of the company\u2019s impact said the huge and expensive expansion of mass transit that is underway now might not have happened if a sudden worsening of traffic had not underscored the need; voters rejected transit expansions multiple times here in the past.Others, like Will Martin, an architect who was walking on a recent morning near his office downtown, worry that the city could become too much of a one-company town, the way it felt in the old days when Boeing would sneeze and the city would pull up the blankets and stay in bed.Brace for a transformation of housing, demography and consumer demand. Here in Seattle, a city still defined by neighborhoods of single-family homes, about 8,000 new apartments are under construction within walking distance of the Amazon campus and are expected to be taken, the company says, mostly by employees. About 20 percent of the company\u2019s 40,000 workers already do not take any motorized transportation at all \u2014 they walk or bike. And more than one in six live and work in the same ZIP code.\u201cAll of a sudden you\u2019re going to get 50,000 requests \u2014 why is the Wi-Fi not faster around here?\u201d said Mike Metzger, the chief executive at Payscale, a wage-analytics company that was founded in Seattle by three executives from Microsoft, and now has dozens of former Amazon workers in its 450-person work force.Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said the stresses and opportunities are combined.\u201cOther cities would kill to have the problems that Seattle has,\u201d he said. The priority, in his view, should be preserving the elements that allowed and encouraged Amazon to put down seeds and grow. \u201cWhat we want to do is maintain the culture that attracted Bezos in the first place,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Sellers Brood as States Come Calling for Taxes", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon and the tax man are back at it again.For years, the company and state governments scuffled over Amazon\u2019s resistance to charging state sales tax, which helped keep prices low on its e-commerce site and angered politicians and other retailers. Eventually, Amazon began adding the tax in states across the country.But there was a loophole. Amazon added the tax only when the item came from its own inventory, not from the millions of independent merchants who sell products through Amazon\u2019s website. Amazon left it up to those sellers \u2014 who account for half of all items sold on the site \u2014 to collect sales tax on their own. But, according to sellers, tax lawyers and accountants who work with them, most do not.Now states, thirsty for the millions of dollars in unpaid sales taxes revenue, are coming for their money.Amazon recently warned its sellers that the company, as of Jan. 1, would be collecting sales tax from merchants who ship orders to its home state, Washington, as it seeks to comply with a state law signed in July. That will be the first time Amazon has collected a state sales tax for the merchants known as marketplace sellers on its site.It is a grudging concession by the online retail giant. In South Carolina, the company is fighting an effort by the state\u2019s Department of Revenue to use existing laws to force Amazon to collect tax on marketplace sales. The state is arguing that Amazon owes it $57 million in such taxes from last year. A judge\u2019s decision in the case is pending.Consumers may absorb much of the new costs. Depending on the state, sales tax can add 5 percent to nearly 10 percent to the cost of an order.Jill Kerr, a spokeswoman for Amazon, declined to comment. In a recent filing with regulators, Amazon singled out South Carolina\u2019s effort as a risk. \u201cIf South Carolina or other states were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities,\u201d Amazon said in the filing. \u201cWe intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\u201dTaxes remain a political sore spot for Amazon, even as it has become one of the most successful companies in the world. President Trump has even taken to criticizing the business on Twitter as a \u201cno-tax monopoly,\u201d attacks that often appear prompted by coverage of him in The Washington Post, which is personally owned by Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive.Amazon pays hundreds of millions of dollars annually in income taxes and charges tax on the sale of its own goods in every state that has a sales tax. But because so many marketplace sellers do not collect sales tax, there is some legitimacy to the idea that Amazon is not doing everything it can to make sure the government gets its cut.Caught in the middle are Amazon\u2019s marketplace sellers, who run the gamut from small mom-and-pop operations to more sophisticated merchants boasting teams of employees.On Amazon\u2019s marketplace, sellers list their products for sale and determine the price. Many take advantage of an additional program, called Fulfillment by Amazon, through which their inventory is stored in Amazon\u2019s warehouses and shipped by the company.The sellers pay Amazon fees for those services, but the e-commerce giant leaves it up to them to collect sales tax where they are required to do so. The fees Amazon charges its marketplace sellers are a huge business for the company, totaling nearly $8 billion during its most recent quarter, up from $5.65 billion a year earlier.Many of the merchants said they have received conflicting advice on their sales tax obligations from accountants and lawyers, according to interviews with several individual merchants and consultants who work with dozens of sellers each. Few want to charge sales tax without assurances that competing merchants on Amazon will do the same.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety,\u201d said Chris McCabe, who previously worked at Amazon and now provides consulting services to merchants. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ambiguity here.\u201dMany Amazon sellers, Mr. McCabe said, live in fear of getting a letter or phone call from a state investigator that leads to a hefty bill for uncollected back sales taxes, which could also come with penalties and interest. The sellers interviewed for this article would speak only on the condition of anonymity, saying they feared attracting the notice of such an investigator.In its early days, Amazon took advantage of that law by keeping its warehouses out of populous states like California. But as the company has grown and focused more on reducing delivery times, it reached deals with many states to set up warehouses inside their borders. As part of those agreements, Amazon typically agreed to begin charging sales taxes after a delay of a few years.Sellers who sign up for Fulfillment by Amazon are probably the most exposed to the state income tax laws. As part of the program, their merchandise gets distributed to numerous Amazon warehouses. Most states take the position that having their inventory in a warehouse, even if the facility belongs to Amazon, creates a duty to charge sales tax on marketplace sales in those states.Not all advisers agree. One electronics seller, who has millions of dollars in annual sales on Amazon, said he only collected sales taxes for orders delivered in his state, on the advice of his accountant.Accountants are not in agreement on the issue either. Michael Fleming, an accountant of Peisner Johnson in Texas, said his firm\u2019s business was booming with Amazon marketplace sellers. He advises them, he said, to charge sales tax wherever a state can argue it has a \u201cnexus\u201d \u2014 the term most used for a physical presence.He said he believed the reason Amazon has been reluctant to step in and charge sales tax on marketplace orders is that it could assume a large additional liability for any mistakes the sellers make.\u201cMaybe the seller mislabels something, and tax that should be collected isn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Fleming said. \u201cThen Amazon gets audited. Amazon is paying tax out of their pocket when it\u2019s really a mistake by an individual seller.\u201dMr. Fleming said he has heard from clients that the states of Washington and California have been particularly aggressive in going after them for back taxes on Amazon marketplace sales.But it could be that the states are simply focusing on a fast-growing part of retail.\u201cGiven the volume of businesses that make retail sales through Amazon\u2019s marketplace platform, it is likely that some of these businesses may have been contacted through the normal course of our tax discovery efforts,\u201d said Beverly Crichfield, a spokeswoman for Washington\u2019s Department of Revenue.Paul Rafelson, an adjunct professor at Pace University\u2019s law school and a lawyer who works with Amazon sellers, said he believed that some states were going after sellers for back taxes to avoid a face-off with the company.\u201cA lot of states,\u201d he said, \u201chave told me it\u2019s too political to go after Amazon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Mad Men\u2019 Creator Matthew Weiner\u2019s Foray Into Fiction", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "ProfileAfter the popular television series ended, everyone was waiting for his next TV show. Instead, he wrote a novel.Supported byAfter he finished working on the final season of his critically acclaimed drama \u201cMad Men,\u201d Matthew Weiner found himself suddenly, alarmingly, unable to write.A few months passed. Then a year. Nothing came to him. Even his children started teasing him, badgering him about what his next project would be.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was going to do next, and I was getting asked all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI was worried I was not going to be able to write again.\u201dFinally, in the summer of 2015, Mr. Weiner called his friend, the novelist A. M. Homes, for advice. She suggested he seclude himself at Yaddo, the artists\u2019 colony in upstate New York. A few months later \u2014 \u201cwith some terror,\u201d he said \u2014 he followed her advice. While there, he began writing an unsettling psychological thriller about a wealthy New York family whose lives intersect with a sociopathic construction worker.It\u2019s unusual for a debut author to be showered in such over-the-top accolades and compared to literary masters. But then again, Mr. Weiner, 52, has hardly been laboring in obscurity. In a screenwriting career that spans more than 20 years, he\u2019s been a creative force behind some of our era\u2019s most revered cable dramas, shows that were credited with reinventing the narrative possibilities of television. He received two Emmys for \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d which he worked on as a writer and producer, and was the creator, showrunner, head writer, director and executive producer for \u201cMad Men,\u201d which aired for seven seasons and won four Golden Globes and 15 Emmys.Writing fiction has long been a goal of his, but it always felt intimidating.\u201cI was always hoping I would do it,\u201d he said during an interview this fall over lunch at the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side, not far from where the novel takes place. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know if I could.\u201dMr. Weiner\u2019s foray into fiction surprised a lot of Hollywood observers. \u201cEveryone was breaking down his door to do another show, and he goes off and does something that no one was expecting,\u201d said Semi Chellas, a writer who worked on \u201cMad Men.\u201d \u201cThe contrariness of going off and writing fiction after \u2018Mad Men\u2019 was very Matt.\u2019 \u201dFor fans of \u201cMad Men,\u201d a precisely observed, sprawling drama that chronicled the hedonistic, boozy office culture of a Madison Avenue advertising agency in the 1960s, \u201cHeather\u201d might seem like a surprising and perhaps unsatisfying creative pivot for Mr. Weiner. The story has just four central characters and can be inhaled in a single sitting. It lacks the long narrative arc and subtle character development that made \u201cMad Men\u201d an addictive and gratifying show that rewarded close watching. But in other ways, \u201cHeather\u201d feels like a stylistic and thematic sibling of \u201cMad Men,\u201d particularly in Mr. Weiner\u2019s almost surgical dissection of the ways that social status, wealth, gender and class define us.\u201cAs we know from his television work, he\u2019s a great observer of people,\u201d said Ms. Messud, author of \u201cThe Burning Girl.\u201d \u201cThis is almost like a bullet train. He\u2019s distilled the narrative down to its essence.\u201d\u201cHeather\u201d unfolds in present-day Manhattan, and like so many gripping New York stories, the plot hinges on real estate. The couple at the center of the story, Mark and Karen Breakstone, lead sheltered, privileged lives, and fawn over their perfect daughter, Heather. Mark, who works in finance, frets about his annual bonus and his status, while Karen stays home to tend to Heather, then becomes resentful when Heather grows up and no longer needs her. The Breakstones\u2019s quiet, simmering dissatisfaction is interwoven with a darker, parallel story about a man named Bobby Klasky, who grew up neglected by his a heroin-addicted mother and developed a violent streak. The two narratives collide when Bobby finds work on a construction crew that is renovating the penthouse in the Breakstones\u2019s building, and becomes obsessed with Heather.Over lunch at the Carlyle, Mr. Weiner was cheerful and animated, occasionally breaking into high pitched peals of laughter. He gushed about his favorite books and authors and seemed more eager to talk about his reading than his writing, noting that he went on a binge-reading tear after finishing \u201cMad Men,\u201d and devoured books by Haruki Murakami, Donna Tartt, Delmore Schwartz, John Steinbeck and Hermann Hesse, among others. He gossiped about famous dead novelists like they were old acquaintances. While describing his writing process and sources of inspiration, he dropped in bits of literary trivia and issued pronouncements about writers he admires.Mark Twain: \u201cHe\u2019s amazing! He dictated!\u201dTolstoy\u2019s \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d: \u201cThere\u2019s like five novels in that thing.\u201dCharles Dickens: \u201cI consider him the first TV writer.\u201dPatricia Highsmith: \u201cShe was at Yaddo! I love her work. I like the fact that it isn\u2019t judgmental and it\u2019s a little perverse.\u201dThe idea for \u201cHeather\u201d came from a scene Mr. Weiner witnessed when he was walking around the Upper East Side. in the fall of 2015. He saw an attractive teenage girl walking into an apartment building where construction work was being done, and noticed one of the workers staring at her with what looked like a mixture of lust and menace. Mr. Weiner jotted down his observations in a notebook where he collects ideas and stray bits of dialogue, and wasn\u2019t sure if anything would come of it.While he was at Yaddo, he kept thinking about the girl and the construction worker, puzzling over what he had seen, and began writing a fictionalized story about the years leading up to the encounter. He wrote 5,000 words over the next 16 days, and finished a draft in nine months.He still seems surprised that he\u2019s adding novelist to his resume. He never expected to finish the book, much less publish it.\u201cIt\u2019s like someone who goes to the casino for the first time and wins,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

We\u2019ve lost our jobs, along wth our dignity along the way.We learned to be guarded, and focus within towards our own behaviors and actions, as these were the only measures we could control. Sexual impropriety among men towards working women and students was, and is still, pervasive.How Far Does This Have to Go?Now that they\u2019ve got the ball rolling, it would probably be easier to identify the few men who HAVE NOT sexually harassed a woman in the workplace or in public or private. I wonder how far this has to go before proper behavior will be expected. Should a line be drawn? Like from today on you all will be fired for your bad behavior.....because in the end 99% of all men will be guilty of some form of sexual harassment from the maintenance guy on up to the president. Feeling Uncomfortable vs. AssaultI sure hope this was not a rush to judgement on NBC\u2019s part. We are on the verge of McCarthy tactics applying to men\u2019s personal behavior. Sexual harassment or assault are terrible things, but not all cases rise to the level of actual assault. Feeling uncomfortable is not assault, and some women seem to have a low bar for what constitutes harassment. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Shop Smart on Black Friday (and Cyber Monday)", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLong before your Thanksgiving dinner has settled, retailers start to lure you in on Black Friday and Cyber Monday with doorbuster sales and in-store discounts.Online stores have already begun \u201cleaking\u201d their big \u2014 and now weeklong \u2014 Cyber Monday sales.Whether you plan to get in line or shop from home, here are some ways to beat the marketing madness and be a smart shopper.It\u2019s hard not to get caught up in the retail frenzy, even if you don\u2019t want to. The ads are everywhere, everyone is talking about deals and it seems like everyone has something on sale.On the surface, it seems appealing: You get an early start on holiday shopping and you save some money, too. If that refrain sounds familiar \u2014 like you fell for it last year \u2014 do a little homework now to save yourself both temptation and money later.If you want a specific item, check its price today at multiple stores. Add those items to a wishlist or your shopping cart (and then abandon the cart) so you can see how much the prices change between now and Cyber Monday. This helps reveal exactly how big a discount that sale price really is.Retailers often offer deep discounts on limited quantities or specific product models in order to lure in buyers. Making a list in advance avoids the old \u201cthis is close enough\u201d rationalization, and it\u2019ll keep you from buying something you didn\u2019t really want just because it was on sale.\u201cMake sure you note the correct model number, since sometimes during the holidays, retailers will feature products that look almost identical but might have completely different features than you\u2019re expecting,\u201d Mr. Burakowski said.But do retailers mark up items just to slash their prices on Black Friday?Aside from using wish lists to track prices, there are tools for your smartphone or computer that can help make sure you\u2019re actually getting a bargain.The downside to tools like these is that they require extensive information about where you\u2019re shopping and what you\u2019re buying in order to work. Similarly, many of them get a cut of your total when you place an order with an online retailer. Neither approach is insidious, but you should be aware of both before you use them.When asked if you should jump on deals as soon as you see them, Mr. Burakowski said there\u2019s no need to. \u201cLast year, we saw a tremendous growth in retailers starting their deals Thursday \u2014 as in, we posted almost as many deals Thursday as we did Friday, and a similar amount on Monday,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the Monday ones were repeats of the ones featured across Thursday and Friday, so you may get another chance to score some of those deals you missed out on.\u201dMr. McAllister agreed. \u201cSome Black Friday deals are already going live, and almost all of them will be available on or before Thanksgiving day,\u201d he said. A lot of those will remain available through the weekend, and bleed into the deals advertised as part of Cyber Monday, which will mostly go live on Sunday, because these terms are effectively meaningless at this point. Internally, we just refer to the whole thing as Deals Week.\u201dJust keep an eye on stock levels. Only jump if you\u2019re worried something will be so popular it\u2019ll sell out.Shopping online in your pajamas is certainly more comfortable than sitting in the cold waiting for a store to open. Mr. Burakowski said that if your impulse is to stay home, follow it.\u201cI\u2019ve never liked lining up overnight and don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it in 99 percent of cases, unless you\u2019ve got a very specific product in mind that has extremely limited quantities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile everything you see offline will be available online, it can be a lot more difficult to get one of the truly rare deals online than if you\u2019re first in line and guaranteed to get it.\u201d\u201cThe only place you should line up on Thanksgiving afternoon is on the line of scrimmage for a family football game,\u201d Mr. McAllister said. \u201cBasically every deal you can get in stores will be available online, and usually matched by multiple other retailers. There are still a handful of doorbusters that are really and truly brick-and-mortar only, but they\u2019re typically low-quality products that you should probably avoid anyway.\u201dFor some, lining up for Black Friday deals is tradition, or a way to spend the day after Thanksgiving getting into the holiday shopping spirit. If getting the best deals and saving money is your goal, it\u2019s not worth it.Keep an eye on your credit and bank statements for fraudulent charges, avoid signing up for high-interest store cards or giving out too much personal information, and use strong passwords when shopping and banking online.Similarly, take steps to protect yourself from online shopping scams and bait-and-switch listings.Shop from reputable sellers and retailers \u2014 and that includes on sites like Amazon, which allow third-parties to list products for sale.Mr. Burakowski noted: \u201cI\u2019d advise shoppers to be extra careful about third party listings on some of the major sites like Amazon. We\u2019ve been seeing a fair few more scam listings, dramatically below the street price of the item from sellers with zero feedback that somehow can become the featured seller.\u201d This rule also applies to sites like eBay, Jet, Shopify and eBid.The best thing you can do is just be patient. Sometimes the best deals are yet to come, and you\u2019ll find them later in the season, on your own schedule, from a retailer you trust. Do your homework and keep a cool head, and you\u2019ll be happier for it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In AT&T Deal, Government Action Catches Up With Trump Rhetoric", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediator\u201cAT&T is buying Time Warner, and thus CNN,\u201d he told his audience, calling the proposed merger an example of a media \u201cpower structure\u201d that was working to suppress his vote and the voices of his supporters. It was, he said, \u201ca deal we will not approve in my administration.\u201dHe specifically cited media concentration. But his singling out of CNN in the context of an alleged plot against him was lost on no one.This raised the chilling possibility that Mr. Trump was making good on his threatening statements in Gettysburg.Adding to the chill was the lack of a compelling legal justification for the department\u2019s conditions, which appeared to come out of the blue. Asking AT&T to divest DirecTV seems to be a non-starter, given how essential DirecTV is as a satellite distributor of content, and the Justice Department had to know that. So in effect, AT&T\u2019s only choice would be to jettison Turner.Justice Department officials offered reporters a different version on Wednesday, saying it was AT&T that had offered to divest CNN to allay antitrust concerns, which the company strenuously denied. The White House said the president had not been involved.All the assertions and denials left a lot of questions about the administration\u2019s motives, but they were ultimately of the president\u2019s own making. There is copious evidence of Mr. Trump\u2019s longstanding vendetta against CNN.Nixon used a threat to bring antitrust action against the broadcast networks for their control of prime-time programming.It is not in a president\u2019s direct power to tighten libel laws. And NBC does not technically have a \u201clicense\u201d \u2014 its broadcast stations do, and stripping their permits involves a complicated process out of a president\u2019s control. So his anti-press threats have so far seemed to be more bark than bite (with the important caveat that news executives fear that his rhetoric could wind up inciting violence against reporters).But the tussle over the merger details brings a new level of seriousness to Mr. Trump\u2019s virulent, anti-press speech, raising fresh concerns that it could result in real-world, governmental action. The appearance alone could be enough to send a powerful message \u2014 cross the executive branch at your own peril.\u201cWe\u2019ve had our differences, but CNN is doing its job covering this administration,\u201d said Ben Smith, the BuzzFeed editor in chief. \u201cThe idea that the White House would even allow itself to appear to retaliate against tough, accurate coverage by holding its parent company hostage is wildly out of line with American traditions.\u201dLate on Wednesday, administration officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly, told reporters that the Justice Department was driven by nonpolitical concerns \u2014 apparently that the huge combination of AT&T\u2019s mobile services and DirecTV with Time Warner\u2019s movie studio, sports and cable businesses would prove harmful to consumers.Legal experts were struck by the idea that the merger has run into such regulatory turbulence, because the deal involves a so-called vertical merger in which the assets of the two companies do not directly compete. \u201cFrom the standpoint of the last 45 years or so of antitrust, and from the standpoint of economic sense, it\u2019s odd,\u201d Ronald A. Cass, dean emeritus of the Boston University School of Law, said in an interview.Mr. Delrahim issued a statement Wednesday saying he had not come under White House pressure on this issue or any other. Maybe he has had a legitimate change of heart about the arrangement since inspecting the deal more closely from his perch at the Justice Department.If Justice Department officials with legitimate concerns about the merger worry that their work will be tainted by the perception that anti-press politics are at play, there\u2019s one remedy: get the boss to zip it.Jaclyn Peiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

With his speeches and flamboyant dressing down of technology companies, he became an emblem of China\u2019s increasingly unapologetic internet controls.The next year, Mr. Lu denied that China engaged in internet censorship.To quell what was perceived as a freewheeling social media, Mr. Lu went after some of the country\u2019s biggest internet personalities. At private dinners he threatened them, and on national television he scolded them. He also limited the functions and purged many of their accounts.Yet his high profile was also a liability.In China, government officials are generally dull and predictable, and Mr. Lu stood out, and often raised eyebrows. Even as his star was rising, rumors swirled about his possible fall from grace. At the World Internet Conference he helped create, he could be seen smoking cigars with a Cuban telecom official and power-walking in sweats for exercise in the morning.The announcement of the investigation could help clear the air ahead of the World Internet Conference, scheduled for two weeks from now in Wuzhen, a canal town in eastern China. Presented as a sort of Davos of the internet, the meeting was conceived as a way to show off China\u2019s new influence over the technology industry.Analysts said that despite the public strutting of Mr. Lu, he had difficulty turning the Cyberspace Administration into a powerful regulator. Created in 2014, the agency was tasked with managing an internet and technology sector already overseen by several ministries as well as China\u2019s security organizations and the military.Mr. Lu will be succeeded by Xu Lin, who worked directly under Mr. Xi when he was briefly party secretary of Shanghai in 2007.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Internet Is Dying. Repealing Net Neutrality Hastens That Death.", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe internet is dying.Sure, technically, the internet still works. Pull up Facebook on your phone and you will still see your second cousin\u2019s baby pictures. But that isn\u2019t really the internet. It\u2019s not the open, anyone-can-build-it network of the 1990s and early 2000s, the product of technologies created over decades through government funding and academic research, the network that helped undo Microsoft\u2019s stranglehold on the tech business and gave us upstarts like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix.Because net neutrality shelters start-ups \u2014 which can\u2019t easily pay for fast-line access \u2014 from internet giants that can pay, the rules are just about the last bulwark against the complete corporate takeover of much of online life. When the rules go, the internet will still work, but it will look like and feel like something else altogether \u2014 a network in which business development deals, rather than innovation, determine what you experience, a network that feels much more like cable TV than the technological Wild West that gave you Napster and Netflix.The five most valuable American companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 control much of the online infrastructure, from app stores to operating systems to cloud storage to nearly all of the online ad business. A handful of broadband companies \u2014 AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon, many of which are also aiming to become content companies, because why not \u2014 provide virtually all the internet connections to American homes and smartphones.Together these giants have carved the internet into a historically profitable system of fiefs. They have turned a network whose very promise was endless innovation into one stuck in mud, where every start-up is at the tender mercy of some of the largest corporations on the planet.The internet\u2019s singular power, in its early gold-rush days, was its flexibility. People could imagine a dazzling array of new uses for the network, and as quick as that, they could build and deploy them \u2014 a site that sold you books, a site that cataloged the world\u2019s information, an application that let you \u201cborrow\u201d other people\u2019s music, a social network that could connect you to anyone.You didn\u2019t need permission for any of this stuff; some of these innovations ruined traditional industries, some fundamentally altered society, and many were legally dubious. But the internet meant you could just put it up, and if it worked, the rest of the world would quickly adopt it.But if flexibility was the early internet\u2019s promise, it was soon imperiled. In 2003, Tim Wu, a law professor now at Columbia Law School (he\u2019s also a contributor to The New York Times), saw signs of impending corporate control over the growing internet. Broadband companies that were investing great sums to roll out faster and faster internet service to Americans were becoming wary of running an anything-goes network.Though it has been through a barrage of legal challenges and resurrections, some form of net neutrality has been the governing regime on the internet since 2005. The new F.C.C. order would undo the idea completely; companies would be allowed to block or demand payment for certain traffic as they liked, as long as they disclosed the arrangements.At the moment, broadband companies are promising not to act unfairly, and they argue that undoing the rules would give them further incentive to invest in their broadband capacity, ultimately improving the internet.Brian Hart, an F.C.C. spokesman, said broadband companies would still be covered by antitrust laws and other rules meant to prevent anticompetitive behavior. He noted that Mr. Pai\u2019s proposals would simply return the network to an earlier, pre-network-neutrality regulatory era.\u201cThe internet flourished under this framework before, and it will again,\u201d he said.Broadband companies are taking a similar line. When I pointed out to a Comcast spokeswoman that the company\u2019s promises were only voluntary \u2014 that nothing will prevent Comcast from one day creating special tiers of internet service with bundled content, much like the way it now sells cable TV \u2014 she suggested I was jumping the gun.Well, O.K. But a vibrant network doesn\u2019t die all at once. It takes time and neglect; it grows weaker by the day, but imperceptibly, so that one day we are living in a digital world controlled by giants and we come to regard the whole thing as normal.It\u2019s not normal. It wasn\u2019t always this way. The internet doesn\u2019t have to be a corporate playground. That\u2019s just the path we\u2019ve chosen.Advertisement"}

But also a perfectly plausible villain, and in his diabolical all-American normalcy a necessary foil for the film\u2019s loose rebel coalition, a band of misfits who come to the Asset\u2019s defense. The most important of these is Elisa (Sally Hawkins), a member of the laboratory\u2019s nighttime cleaning staff, who plays jazz records for the piscine captive, feeds him hard-boiled eggs and before long falls in love with him.Elisa\u2019s interest is stirred less by curiosity than by recognition.

Its busy plot moves swiftly \u2014 the presence of Russian spies never hurts, especially when one is played by Michael Stuhlbarg \u2014 except when Mr. del Toro lingers over a moment of tenderness, a delicate joke or an eruption of grace.Mr. del Toro, though he has dabbled in large-scale, franchise-ready filmmaking, has never succumbed to the authoritarian aesthetic of the Hollywood blockbuster. He is a reflexive democrat whose underdog sympathies haven\u2019t curdled into glum superhero self-pity. The most welcome and notable thing about \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d is its generosity of spirit, which extends beyond the central couple. Zelda and Giles, an artist whose advertising career has been derailed, are not just supporting players. They have miniature movies of their own, as does Mr. Stuhlbarg\u2019s scientist-cum-spook. And so, for that matter, does Strickland, though it isn\u2019t a movie anyone else would want to be in, not least because it feels the closest to reality.In Mr. del Toro\u2019s world, though, reality is the domain of rules and responsibilities, and realism is a crabbed, literal-minded view of things that can be opposed only by the forces of imagination. This will never be a fair or symmetrical fight, and the most important reason to make movies like this one \u2014 or, for that matter, to watch them \u2014 is to even the odds.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

Even the carousel horses looked hot.Not that she could do much of anything until Matteo Pascale, the child actor playing Ethan, said his line, \u201cGo away!\u201d The boy, perched on a carousel pony, didn\u2019t want to say it.Ms. Brosnahan tried sympathy: \u201cI know you would never say that to your mom, but I\u2019m only pretend.\u201dShe tried sense: \u201cThe sooner you\u2019ll say it, the sooner you\u2019ll be done.\u201dFinally, she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear me talk any more.\u201dThat\u2019s a controversial statement. As the latest show from Ms. Sherman-Palladino, who created \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d and \u201cBunheads,\u201d \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d is predicated on the great pleasure of hearing brainy, mouthy women talk until their lips ache.Her Bronx-born dad had made his start in the early \u201960s in Greenwich Village basket houses (so-called because performers worked for tips tossed into passed baskets), a time and a scene Ms. Sherman-Palladino long envied. In a pitch meeting with Amazon, she said she started to riff on how it would feel for a woman to enter that comedy man\u2019s world. \u201cI have a big mouth, and it sort of just happened,\u201d she said.Well-behaved women seldom make for good television. See all the titles in this collection on Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site.On a weekday morning in early fall, Ms. Sherman-Palladino, mouth and all, sat next to her husband, Daniel Palladino, a director, writer and executive producer on the show. They had crammed together onto a couch in a corner of the Chelsea sound studio where they had met to edit the first-season finale. On the street below, a woman walked by wearing a tank top that read, \u201cOy with the poodles already,\u201d a beloved \u201cGilmore\u201d catchphrase. \u201cIt\u2019s funny what people pick up on,\u201d Mr. Palladino said.As in Ms. Sherman-Palladino\u2019s previous shows, \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d pals around with a woman after a domestic cataclysm sort of just happens. Lorelai Gilmore, a Harvard-bound debutante, has a kid at 16 and flees her upper-class family for an unglamorous job at an inn. Michelle Simms, the protagonist of \u201cBunheads,\u201d goes from Vegas showgirl to beach town widow. Midge Maisel puts down the Pyrex and picks up a mic.Like Lorelai, like Michelle, Midge finds herself \u201cin a whole other life that she hadn\u2019t really thought about or considered,\u201d Ms. Sherman-Palladino said.As compared with those other shows, that life is a lot more artfully rendered. Midge has a knockout period wardrobe in sea green and paradise pink. Midcentury New York cleans up well, too. The characters are Upper West Side Jews, a seeming contrast to the Connecticut WASPs of \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d although as Ms. Sherman-Palladino said, \u201cLorelai and Rory were the most Jewish WASPs I\u2019ve ever written for.\u201d (Remember \u201cOy with the poodles\u201d?)While Amazon declined to comment on how a lively, lippy, New York-centric comedy like \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d meshed with these other projects, the streaming service signed Ms. Sherman-Palladino and her husband to an overall deal in September.Marc Resteghini, Amazon\u2019s head of current series, wrote in an email that the service had been attracted to \u201can exciting and colorful portrait of a character, who was beautifully inhabited by Rachel Brosnahan. We knew immediately that we wanted to see more than just one season.\u201dAfter years of having networks and studios interfere with their past shows, Ms. Sherman-Palladino described the relief of landing at Amazon.\u201cThey trust us,\u201d she said, adding a profane intensifier. (Ms. Sherman-Palladino adds a lot of profane intensifiers.)It\u2019s a pleasure they haven\u2019t been indulging. For the first season of \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d they wrote and directed seven of the eight episodes. They chose the chirpy music (heavy on the Peggy Lee), they oversaw the jewel-tone design, they masterminded the editing and the sound mixing.\u201cWhich is a racy joke and one of the best jokes ever,\u201d Ms. Sherman-Palladino said.Mr. Palladino added, \u201cThat\u2019s what all stand-up comics do.\u201dMs. Brosnahan said she doesn\u2019t think of herself as a comedian. She has never tried stand-up, except while filming, and she doesn\u2019t plan to. \u201cThe idea of doing an open mic makes me throw up,\u201d she said, sitting in a West Village cafe near the clubs where Midge would have performed. (Rain had curtailed a walk past those clubs.)Shooting the pilot, she felt \u201chorrified just petrified\u201d about the stand-up sequence. Having shot seven more episodes, she added, \u201cI remain completely petrified in a really satisfying way, you know?\u201dWhat else might satisfy?Midge herself, who Ms. Sherman-Palladino describes as \u201cpure energy and pure light and such strength,\u201d which makes her sound like a lot of Ms. Sherman-Palladino\u2019s talky, resilient women.But there\u2019s a key difference. Midge, Ms. Sherman-Palladino said proudly, has found \u201ca much bigger audience to mouth off at.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With AT&T and Time Warner, Battle Lines Form for an Epic Antitrust Case", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIf the government goes to court to block the merger of AT&T and Time Warner, as seems increasingly likely, it may well be the antitrust case of the decade, even without the claims of presidential meddling that have already engulfed the deal in partisan controversy.A lawsuit by the Justice Department, along with its earlier, widely reported demands that AT&T sell either DirecTV or Turner Broadcasting to gain approval for the deal, would mark a radical departure from decades of antitrust enforcement policy, both in defining what is an unlawful anticompetitive merger and in fashioning a remedy to cure the problems.That\u2019s because the combination of AT&T and Time Warner is what\u2019s known as a \u201cvertical\u201d merger, meaning that the two companies don\u2019t compete to any significant degree in their primary lines of business, which are telecommunications (AT&T) and entertainment (Time Warner). There would be the same number of competitors in both fields after the merger as there were before it.This week, two Barclays analysts, Kannan Venkateshwar and Amir Rozwadowski, called the government\u2019s threat to block the deal \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said they were \u201cperplexed\u201d given the Justice Department\u2019s longstanding leniency toward vertical mergers.Referring to Louis D. Brandeis, the former Supreme Court justice, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a populist, Brandeisian movement that\u2019s rising.\u201dPresident Trump tapped into that sentiment during the campaign when he described the proposed AT&T-Time Warner combination as \u201ca deal we will not approve in my administration because it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201dThat\u2019s a view shared by many progressive media critics, including an influential group of young antitrust professors who have been calling for stricter review of vertical mergers, especially in media and entertainment. Prominent Democrats also criticized the proposed deal.But since the election, Mr. Trump has continued to insert himself into what is supposed to be an independent review. On Wednesday, even as the Justice Department was said to be putting the finishing touches on its complaint, he renewed his attacks on CNN, the Time Warner-owned cable news network and his No. 1 media nemesis.The Justice Department hasn\u2019t explicitly demanded that AT&T divest CNN, but it\u2019s a key part of Turner Broadcasting. Should CNN be sold, it could easily fall into the hands of far more Trump-friendly owners than AT&T or Time Warner, such as conservative-leaning Sinclair Broadcasting, which has been on the acquisitions trail, or Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox. Fox bid for all of Time Warner\u2019s assets in 2014 but said at the time that it would divest CNN to avoid antitrust concerns. (Fox might find Trump-appointed antitrust regulators to be friendlier this time.)Even when the government challenges vertical mergers, they are usually resolved by consent decree or other arrangements, in which the merged companies agree not to engage in anticompetitive behavior and to abide by conditions imposed by the government.That was the approach when Comcast acquired NBC Universal in 2011, a deal that raised many of these same issues. Comcast agreed to more than 150 conditions, many aimed at preventing Comcast from favoring NBC Universal content at the expense of competitors.While there continue to be critics of the Comcast-NBC merger, it\u2019s hard to argue that competition in news and entertainment has diminished as a result, given the rise of Netflix and Amazon and the explosion in entertainment options that followed the merger.But there\u2019s also a growing sense that such agreements are easily circumvented and that the government doesn\u2019t have the resources to oversee hundreds of such limitations. The alternative is to demand divestitures, as the government has done during negotiations with AT&T. Such \u201cstructural\u201d remedies, as they\u2019re known, \u201care much easier than behavioral remedies to craft and enforce,\u201d Professor Stucke said.\u201cOur goal in remedying unlawful transactions should be to let the competitive process play out,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, behavioral remedies often fail to do that. Instead of protecting the competition that might be lost in an unlawful merger, a behavioral remedy supplants competition with regulation.\u201dDivestitures have long been the preferred remedy for horizontal mergers, where there\u2019s an overlap between the two companies. Airlines, for example, may have to sell routes or airport gates where the two airlines compete; cable operators may have to sell operations in cities where both companies operate.A study by the Federal Trade Commission found that concerns about every vertical merger examined by the commission from 2006 to 2012 were resolved through \u201cconduct remedies\u201d rather than divestitures, and that all these remedies had been successful at protecting competition.That hasn\u2019t mollified a new generation of antitrust activists. Tim Wu, an antitrust professor at Columbia University and one of the leading proponents of a more intense scrutiny of media mergers, told me that the deal should be blocked on grounds that a combined megacompany could exert \u201cbroad anticompetitive effects.\u201dSay, for example, that a combined AT&T-Time Warner aggressively raised prices for popular offerings like HBO and CNN. Rival distributors, such as cable companies, would have to pay much higher prices, passing the increases on to consumers, or drop the channels, forcing consumers who want them to turn to other distributors, such as AT&T, reinforcing its already commanding position in satellite, wireless and broadband distribution.This threat of higher prices and restricted consumer choice appears to be the theory the Justice Department is pursuing, according to people briefed on the negotiations.Further clouding any action is Mr. Trump\u2019s outspoken animosity toward CNN. Antitrust enforcement decisions are supposed to be based solely on the facts and law, not on politics, and no one I spoke to could recall a president who so publicly inserted himself into an antitrust enforcement investigation. (While Richard Nixon notoriously meddled in antitrust enforcement in the 1970s, he kept his machinations secret, at least until they were exposed by Oval Office tape recordings.)Mr. Delrahim has pledged an independent review uninfluenced by politics. Professor Stucke noted that the investigation began during the Obama administration, and that \u201cit\u2019s unlikely senior leadership would go out on a limb to challenge the merger unless the staff had recommended it.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re career professionals,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d start with the presumption the staff was diligent and followed the evidence.\u201dAn AT&T spokesman declined to comment, as did the Department of Justice.Asked this week whether there had been communications about the case with the White House, Attorney General Jeff Sessions declined to answer, fueling speculation that there may have been some.Should the case be filed and go to trial, that\u2019s one mystery that will soon be resolved: Some of AT&T\u2019s first subpoenas will no doubt go to the White House.An earlier version of this column erroneously included Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont among the Democrats who have criticized the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner. Mr. Sanders is an independent, not a Democrat.Advertisement"}

We have been acting. Some of the steps we took were visible, and others weren\u2019t. We have a process in place, and we followed that process.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Oreskes said: \u201cI am deeply sorry to the people I hurt. My behavior was wrong and inexcusable, and I accept full responsibility.\u201dOn Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Mohn addressed Mr. Oreskes\u2019s resignation during a segment on NPR\u2019s \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d program. Mr. Mohn confirmed that NPR had first learned of a sexual harassment allegation involving Mr. Oreskes in the fall of 2015, calling Mr. Oreskes\u2019s actions \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cdeplorable.\u201d NPR investigated the complaint, Mr. Mohn said, and put Mr. Oreskes on notice.Last fall, another woman told NPR that Mr. Oreskes harassed her roughly two decades ago, while he was working at The Times. And last month, a third woman complained to NPR about Mr. Oreskes\u2019s behavior when he was at The Times.After that complaint, Mr. Mohn said, he put out a memo asking anyone who had experienced or witnessed any questionable behavior to contact NPR. \u201cNo one stepped forward,\u201d he said.Mr. Mohn batted back any suggestion that NPR had not taken action against Mr. Oreskes until after The Post published its article. But he acknowledged that NPR could have done more.\u201cClearly, we didn\u2019t do everything we could, because it didn\u2019t result in the right answer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to suggest we were not doing anything or we were not acting appropriately or that we were doing nothing is false.\u201dHe said a new, internal case involving Mr. Oreskes\u2019s dealings with a current employee came to light after the reports were published, which led him to put Mr. Oreskes on leave on Tuesday and then ask for his resignation.Mr. Oreskes\u2019s career in journalism stretches back some 40 years. He started at The Daily News, where he was labor editor and City Hall bureau chief. He joined The Times in 1981, and held many jobs in two decades at the paper, including chief political correspondent and deputy managing editor.He has also won three Emmy Awards as a producer of documentaries and has served on the boards of the American Society of News Editors, City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism and Columbia Journalism Review. (He resigned from the journalism school\u2019s board on Wednesday. He remains on the boards of the editors\u2019 organization and C.J.R.)Mr. Oreskes, 63, is the latest powerful media figure to face accusations of sexual harassment. Since reports began to surface several weeks ago involving allegations of sexual harassment and assault by the entertainment tycoon Harvey Weinstein, the floodgates seem to have opened.Advertisement"}

I didn\u2019t ask him to do it, but it was a thrill nonetheless. After all, he\u2019s aimed that very same foot at the heads of action superstars like Dolph Lundgren, Bolo Yeung and Sylvester Stallone.\u201cI still love martial arts,\u201d he said, breaking into a broad smile. \u201cMartial arts changed my life. If you were born in the dojo, you will die in the dojo.\u201dIn \u201cJean-Claude Van Johnson,\u201d his first television drama series, the 57-year-old actor tackles no fewer than three roles. He plays a fictionalized version of himself, a time-traveling doppelg\u00e4nger and a simpering, squeaky-voiced Bulgarian factory worker.It\u2019s a remarkable turnaround for this Belgian-born actor, who became a bankable action star in the 1980s and \u201990s in films directed by some of Hong Kong\u2019s greatest action directors, then watched as personal troubles \u2014 an addiction to cocaine, contentious divorces \u2014 scuttled his career.Rather than dodge the actor\u2019s sometimes rocky past, the series lovingly mocks it. Throughout the six-part series, references are sprinkled to Van Damme films and life stories from the past, including parodies of training sequences and nods to his years filming in places like Bulgaria and China.\u201cI told them I\u2019d like to play with the notions of who he is and what he represents in the culture,\u201d Mr. Callaham said. \u201cHe was my favorite actor growing up, so I wanted to talk about the ups and downs of his career, and to do something that involved all those different worlds. And they said, great, we don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dBut Mr. Callaham was very apprehensive about how Mr. Van Damme would react when he pitched the show. \u201cI didn\u2019t know J.C. personally, and I didn\u2019t know what his appetite would be for making fun of himself,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of those guys, those \u201980s guys especially, are not open to that.\u201dAnd the treatment he created for Scott Free was, as he recalled, \u201cinsane.\u201d (It opened with Mr. Van Damme as a forgotten sad sack who played Frisbee golf to stay in shape.) Without Mr. Callaham\u2019s knowledge, the folks at Scott Free sent the treatment to Mr. Van Damme, who loved it.A meeting was set up, but Mr. Callaham was still nervous about meeting his lifelong hero. As a self-described \u201ctiny kid\u201d growing up in the \u201980s, during the era of Arnold and Hulk Hogan, Mr. Callaham had idolized the smaller, speedier action star, and now he was finally going to meet him. \u201cI had a panic attack,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI locked myself in the bathroom at Scott Free and refused to come out.\u201dWith the new show, Mr. Van Damme, a native French speaker, has no problem mocking his image. Dressed in a black \u201cBrussels, Belgium\u201d T-shirt and jeans, he spoke candidly about his early days in Hollywood trying to convince casting agents that he spoke English (\u201cit was a catastrophe\u201d) and about past roles. \u201cI made 40-plus movies where you see me with a gun and that one neutral face,\u201d he said.The series also shows the softer side of Mr. Van Damme, who, in the film (and, one could argue, in life) is often his own worst enemy. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s on this real razor\u2019s edge between wanting to be very big and outgoing, and wanting to really keep to himself and be very private,\u201d said Kat Foster (\u201cWeeds\u201d), who plays his black ops sidekick and ex-girlfriend. \u201cI think \u2018J.C.V.J.\u2019 is a homage to the quieter parts of him, the parts of him that he prefers to hide.\u201d\u201cWhen I lost my \u2018Timecop\u2019 fame because of some stupidity, and then I didn\u2019t do any theatrical film for nine, 10 years except \u2018Expendables 2,\u2019 I said to my mother, before you go, mama, I\u2019m gonna make sure I\u2019m back in theaters, and we\u2019ll have a big premiere in Paris,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s happening.

{"Headline": "Young and in Love \u2026 With Lipstick and Eyeliner", "Date": "2017-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMeghan Roark isn\u2019t too proud to admit she has an addiction. Her habit? Makeup.Ms. Roark, a 27-year-old who works in retail in Abingdon, Va., estimates that she spends $300 a month on cosmetics and skin care. She watches at least three hours of tutorials each week on YouTube, learning new techniques or keeping up on emerging brands. Her morning makeup routine takes 30 minutes and involves up to 15 products.Young shoppers like Ms. Roark are the driving force behind a boom in the cosmetics industry. Always camera ready, they are buying and using almost 25 percent more cosmetics than they did just two years ago and significantly more than baby boomers, according to the research firm NPD. And millennials who identify themselves as \u201cmakeup enthusiasts,\u201d NPD found, are using six products each day.Ms. Roark, after setting aside money she had received as a birthday gift, spent $109 during a recent shopping spree at Ulta Beauty, picking up primer, foundation and a new eye shadow palette. \u201cI think every girl likes buying clothes, but for me, I prefer to spend my money on makeup,\u201d she said.The striking expansion in cosmetics is a bright spot in what is otherwise a challenging environment for retailers and packaged goods companies. Big jumps in the sale of shimmery highlights, lush liquid stain lipsticks and dewy foundations have propelled the stocks of cosmetics giants Est\u00e9e Lauder and L\u2019Oreal to record highs.Moreover, the growth in the cosmetics industry is probably understated, since most estimates fail to capture sales at online retailers like Amazon.The brand\u2019s success illustrates the way that millennials \u2014 who may spend hours on social media platforms watching video bloggers and following so-called influencers \u2014 are rewriting the rules. And brands are racing to evolve with the quickly changing market.Cosmetic companies are shifting ad dollars from traditional television and print platforms to Instagram and YouTube. Trips to exotic locations that were once reserved for editors from glossy magazines now go to influential social media personalities from all over the world who have thousands or even millions of subscribers hanging on their every post. And brands that once partnered with actresses or models to create a new shade of lipstick or blush are now collaborating with these influencers.\u201cIt was stunning,\u201d said Mary Dillon, the chief executive of Ulta, standing inside the retailer\u2019s first store in Manhattan just days before its grand opening in November.Even products that have been around for decades are being \u201cdiscovered\u201d by millennials through social media. Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Double Wear foundation, a product that was launched 30 years ago, is experiencing double-digit growth rates, said Jane Hertzmark Hudis, group president at Est\u00e9e Lauder.\u201cIt\u2019s popular among millennials because it looks great in a selfie,\u201d said Ms. Hertzmark Hudis, who also reported big jumps in sales of skin care products \u2014 particularly masks, which play well on social media and video blogs, or vlogs.Beauty vlogging isn\u2019t new, but brands have rapidly ramped up their involvement with it after seeing the power it has to influence consumers.Some of the earliest adopters of the social media influence strategy were smaller brands that lacked the ad budget or experience for a traditional campaign. Those brands instead got noticed by putting their products into the hands of a growing army of beauty vloggers.The indie brand Becca Cosmetics took it a step further in 2015 when it partnered with Ms. Hill to create a $38 highlighter called \u201cChampagne Pop.\u201d All 25,000 units of the shimmery powder sold in 20 minutes on Sephora.com. Last year, Est\u00e9e Lauder acquired Becca in a deal reportedly worth $200 million.What has also changed is the insatiable appetite of millennials for social media. The same group that might tune out a 30-second television ad will consume hours of videos and postings. In the past year, global views of beauty videos on YouTube surged 60 percent, to 219 billion, according to Pixability, a Boston-based company that tracks influencers and provides data to brands. Pixability estimated that millennials make up 60 percent of the beauty audience on Facebook.While it is easy \u2014 and cheap \u2014 for brands to fling free products at beauty vloggers in hopes of a positive review, brands are now forming closer relationship with them.Influencers are being actively pursued for sponsorships \u2014 videos or posts in which the brand pays the influencer to, presumably, endorse its product. (Under Federal Trade Commission rules, video bloggers must disclose if a post has been paid for, often using #ad or #spon and #companyname to do so.)But brands and influencers are walking a fine line as they form tighter bonds. Beauty influencers who grew their subscriber base by providing honest reviews risk losing that trust if their audience believes that they have been paid to give only glowing reviews.A flash point for some fans are influencer trips. Some cosmetic companies have flown groups of influencers to Bora Bora; Necker Island, the private enclave of Sir Richard Branson in the British Virgin Islands; and Kauai in Hawaii for lavish, all expense paid vacations. In exchange, most influencers agree to post a certain number of YouTube videos or Instagram posts about the company\u2019s products.\u201cThe trips are being villainized in a way because people feel since we\u2019re going on the trips that we won\u2019t be genuine about the products and our reviews,\u201d said Samantha Ravndahl, a 24-year-old influencer from Canada with 2.4 million Instagram followers who has gone to Bora Bora and the Cannes Film Festival with cosmetics companies. \u201cBut the reality of the situation is, with the amount of money that people are making in this industry, a trip to wherever is a drop in the bucket. It\u2019s simply not enough to buy people.\u201dFor brands, there are other risks. Unlike scripted commercials with paid actresses, the brands lose some control over the messaging and content on a video blog. And many influencers, especially mega-influencers with followers that number in the millions, typically have relationships with multiple brands, raising the prospect that an unlucky product will get lost in a mix of hashtags.Gabriel Zamora, a 24-year-old \u201cbeauty boy\u201d vlogger from Los Angeles, said he has relationships with about 20 brands. He said he mostly receives free products from the companies and has been selective about his paid endorsements. This year, Mr. Zamora teamed up with Mac Cosmetics, owned by Est\u00e9e Lauder, for his own lipstick.\u201cA lot of brands are still playing with the idea, \u2018How do we work with influencers and have them not bash our products?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Zamora. \u201cThere are brands that do get their feelings hurt when you do speak badly about a product but the fact is, not every brand is going to launch an entire line of products that are all going to be good. There is going to be a miss.\u201dA company that started on the internet, e.l.f. has eschewed celebrities, including mega-influencers, to tout its relatively inexpensive products. Instead, e.l.f. focused its efforts on locating micro-influencers, up-and-coming beauty vloggers who are still building their audiences.But executives say staying ahead of millennials is a tricky business.\u201cFive years ago, no one talked about Instagram and today, Instagram is probably the number one social media platform for our products,\u201d said Mr. Amin, who has spent 30 years in the packaged goods industry. \u201cAnd five years from now, it will be something else.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fanatics, Maker of Sports Apparel, Thrives by Seizing the Moment", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCONSHOHOCKEN, Pa. \u2014 This fall, as some of the N.F.L.\u2019s corporate partners fretted about the league\u2019s handling of its players kneeling during the national anthem, the sports merchandise company Fanatics pounced.When Alejandro Villanueva, a Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman, stood for the anthem and the rest of the team stayed in the locker room, his name began trending on Twitter. Fanatics quickly posted a rendering of his No. 78 jersey on its website and on the N.F.L.\u2019s online shop, which it also operates.Sales skyrocketed. Manufacturing facilities in Kentucky and Florida went to work pressing Mr. Villanueva\u2019s name and number onto thousands of blank Pittsburgh jerseys for next-day shipping. Overnight, a player who had never caught a pass or scored a touchdown had the N.F.L.\u2019s best-selling jersey.\u201cThat moment happened, people wanted to immediately buy that jersey,\u201d Michael Rubin, the company\u2019s chairman and principal owner said. \u201cA week later, that moment is mostly over.\u201dThese micro-moments, as Mr. Rubin calls them, happen all the time in sports: A player reaches a milestone, has a breakout performance or is traded to a new team. Apparel companies have traditionally been poorly positioned to meet the accompanying fan demand as it surges. Fanatics is changing that and, in the process, carving out a lucrative niche in a fiercely competitive online-retail industry largely dominated by Amazon.Fanatics has licensing rights with the North America\u2019s four major sports leagues, more than 500 colleges, Nascar, Major League Soccer and the Professional Golf Association. The company is similar to fast-fashion retailers like H&M, Uniqlo and Zara, integrating design and manufacturing with distribution to fulfill orders within hours. After the Chicago Cubs won the World Series last year, Fanatics used Uber to deliver championship gear to some fans within minutes.As a result, Fanatics has more than doubled its revenue in just a few years. It expects to take in $2 billion in 2017, and to ship more than 10 million items from Nov. 27, Cyber Monday, to Christmas, at a rate of 40,000 packages an hour, its busiest holiday retail season to date.The strategy has attracted a $1 billion investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. The Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has also taken a stake.\u201cIf you\u2019re selling the same merchandise that\u2019s commonly available, and you\u2019ve got no point of differentiation, you\u2019re dead,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of when you die.\u201dMr. Rubin said that his company\u2019s licensing deals, which run from 13 to 17 years long with each of the four major professional sports leagues, are exclusive enough that \u201csomebody can\u2019t be a significant player without the rights that we possess.\u201dAmazon sells and ships team-branded products from some licensed vendors and through its third-party marketplace. For now at least, Mr. Rubin sounds like he does not see that as much of a threat.\u201cAmazon is an incredible company,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have 5,000 full-time employees that go to bed and wake up thinking about the licensed sports business.\u201dMr. Rubin, 45, got into the industry as a 12-year-old selling ski equipment out of his parents\u2019 basement in nearby Lafayette Hill.He attended Villanova University for one semester before dropping out to start a business that handled online sales and fulfillment for big-box retailers just as the e-commerce wave was beginning. He sold the company, G.S.I. Commerce, to eBay for $2.4 billion in 2011, not long after he became a part-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers. (He also owns a stake in the New Jersey Devils.)Among G.S.I.\u2019s properties was Fanatics, which had started in 1995 as a single brick-and-mortar store in a mall in Jacksonville, Fla. Mr. Rubin liked the business so much that he bought it and two other consumer-oriented properties back from eBay, combining them into a company called Kynetic.\u201cWe sold the company on a Friday and we were at work again on Monday morning,\u201d Saj Cherian, Mr. Rubin\u2019s chief of staff, said during an interview at the company\u2019s offices in this Philadelphia suburb on a recent afternoon.\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Rubin interjected, \u201cI was at work Saturday morning.\u201dThe industry that fuels Mr. Rubin\u2019s enthusiasm is substantial. According to the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers Association, global retail sales of licensed sports merchandise reached $25 billion in 2016. The largest portion of that, 28.1 percent, was apparel.But after a jersey and T-shirt craze in the 1990s, demand flattened. Leagues parceled out their most precious licenses to brands like Nike and Adidas, which mostly seemed concerned with using on-field uniforms as marketing tools, rather than with producing gear for fans.At that point, Mr. Rubin said, the licensed sports merchandise market was \u201ca very sleepy business\u201d without a robust online presence. The leagues were doing more to reach fans directly in areas like ticketing and social media, he said, but lagging when it came to selling goods.Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, agreed.\u201cThe industry needed to be disrupted,\u201d Mr. Kraft said. Referring to Mr. Rubin, he said: \u201cHe\u2019s brought tech, innovation and a vertical on-demand model that\u2019s brought agility to an industry that hadn\u2019t changed much in decades.\u201dAmong the micro-moments that highlighted the new need for speed was Jeremy Lin\u2019s emergence as a sudden star for the New York Knicks in 2012 amid the so-called Linsanity phenomenon.\u201cWhen Linsanity happened, within 12 hours to 24 hours, there were no jerseys to get,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cSo you had this huge demand, and there\u2019s no jerseys available. Then you order them like crazy, and by the time they get in, the moment\u2019s over.\u201dSal LaRocca, the N.B.A.\u2019s president of global partnerships, said the episode \u201cwas a large catalyst in moving to where we ultimately moved to with Fanatics.\u201d The N.B.A. entered an initial partnership with the company in 2015 to run the N.B.A. store; Fanatics acquired the rights to sell replica jerseys beginning this season.In 2013, Mr. Rubin moved most of Fanatics\u2019 executive team to Silicon Valley from Florida and started a team dedicated to mobile platforms. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get the type of talent we needed in the speed we needed in Jacksonville,\u201d he said.This year, the company will spend $120 million to improve the customer experience, its data acquisition efforts, its communications with manufacturers and the Fanatics app.The investment is critical, Mr. Rubin said, given that 90 percent of the company\u2019s business is online, and more than 50 percent comes through mobile devices. Fanatics declined to disclose sales figures, but said that about a quarter of its sales have traditionally come in December. This year, it expects 70 million unique visitors to its websites, including more than 300 online team stores, for the month.Major League Baseball said sales of Fanatics products on MLBShop.com were up 67 percent this year, thanks in part to the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on hot-market items.\u201cIt\u2019s an untapped market that we\u2019ve all been missing,\u201d said Noah Garden, M.L.B.\u2019s executive vice president of business.Fanatics\u2019 only ties to brick-and-mortar retailing are the roughly 30 team or league outlets operates in arenas and stadiums. Mr. Rubin envisions the arena stores complementing the online operation, with fans at games using their phones to order goods, and then having the items delivered directly to their seats.Sports is particularly well suited to online retail, with many fans living far from their favorite teams\u2019 hometowns. But Fanatics\u2019 success depends in part on its deals with the leagues, which could create competition by entering agreements with rivals.\u201cWhile I have a lot of admiration for what Fanatics has done, what they\u2019re doing is replicable,\u201d said Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at the market research firm NPD Group.The company is not waiting for that to happen. Doug Mack, the Fanatics\u2019 chief executive, said it wanted to expand globally, and had already acquired rights to sell merchandise from nearly a dozen English Premier League teams, including Manchester United and Everton.Mr. Rubin said he thought Fanatics could be a $10 billion company in 10 years, with half of its business coming from beyond North America.At that size, it would surpass Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and Under Armour, even if sports fans might not realize who was responsible for that must-have Tom Brady jersey.\u201cThey probably don\u2019t know it now,\u201d Mr. Kraft, the Patriots owner, said. \u201cBut they will.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified one of the English Premier League teams that has a licensing deal with Fanatics, the sports merchandise company. It is Everton, not Chelsea.An earlier version of this article misidentified the operator of the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 website. It is the team itself, not the sports apparel maker Fanatics.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time to Talk Turkey About Thanksgiving Films", "Date": "2017-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingIn these ultra-anxious times, we might find ourselves looking ever more forward to the happier times of year. That may be why the Hallmark Channel started advertising its coming Christmas movies well before Halloween, let alone Thanksgiving, and is showing them now.The movie I most associate with Thanksgiving is the 1933 original of \u201cKing Kong.\u201d The film itself has no thematic connection to the season, but on Thanksgiving Day the New York television station WOR/Channel 9 aired it every year without fail. As a movie-mad youngster I lived for this broadcast. I got even more excited when the station added \u201cSon of Kong\u201d and \u201cMighty Joe Young\u201d to the mix and, as I got into my teens, Japanese monster movies like, yes, \u201cKing Kong vs. Godzilla.\u201d (My memory is such that I might be conflating movies that played the day after Thanksgiving with those that played on the holiday proper, but it is a four-day weekend after all.) Soon enough, the adults in the room had tired of indulging me and took back the television to use it as God intended on Thanksgiving, which is to watch football.The movie is streaming \u2014 supposedly \u2014 on the app of the cable channel Starz. I normally gain access to this app through my cable provider user ID and password, but when I tried to watch the film that way on my iPad, a black screen and a message, in a very elegant typeface, appeared instead: \u201cFirst, a quick piece of business: While you now have access to tons of your favorite stuff, this title isn\u2019t offered by your provider. We\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll find more of the obsessable series and movies that you crave.\u201d Let the subscriber beware. I was able to watch \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles\u201d on Starz through Amazon Channels, and remind me to cancel that subscription before my seven-day free trial runs out (oops, too late now).The movie is brisk and consistently funny, and it hits the sentiment bone in a smart, relatively honest way. The slow-burn rage of Mr. Martin against the oblivious amiability of Mr. Candy (his character\u2019s signature line: \u201cThe last thing I want to be remembered as is an annoying blabbermouth\u201d) remains a spectacular comedic blend. As is customary with films written and directed by John Hughes in the 1980s, there\u2019s an American class-analysis subtext that holds the characterizations together: Mr. Martin\u2019s aspirational hauteur is the irresistible force bulldozing into the immovable object of Mr. Candy\u2019s just-folks awkwardness. The language is still super-salty even by today\u2019s standards, so it might not be fun for the entire family.When I\u2019m inclined to recreate my Thanksgiving movie reveries of old, well, I cannot tell a lie: I will go with my nice Blu-ray Disc of the 1933 original of \u201cKing Kong.\u201d The movie is still enough of a classic that there\u2019s nowhere you can stream it free (legally). But you can rent or buy it from Amazon, iTunes and the other usual suspects. If you\u2019re a premium member at Warner Archive, that streaming service offers the agreeable not-quite-sequel \u201cSon of Kong,\u201d featuring the great beast\u2019s far-less-terrifying-but-still-engaging offspring. \u201cKing Kong vs. Godzilla\u201d has yet to hit streaming services, but several \u201960s Japanese monster movies, from \u201cGodzilla\u201d itself to the definitively odd \u201cWar of the Gargantuas,\u201d have just landed in the aforementioned Starz app, although, again, if you\u2019re going through your cable provider, you might not be able to access them. In which case, there\u2019s always football.Advertisement"}

The GoodLight website accounts for 15 percent of its sales, which could reach $1.5 million this year; the e-commerce behemoth Amazon makes up another 10 percent. And many of the company\u2019s business documents are stored in cloud-based data centers.But the costs of doing business on the internet may be about to rise.Without those regulations, GoodLight and other smaller businesses fear they may not have a level digital playing field to compete against deep-pocketed industry giants that could pay to get an edge online.\u201cFor such an analog product, we\u2019re heavily reliant on the digital world and the internet for our day-to-day operations,\u201d said Mr. Callicott, who helped found the company nearly eight years ago and now works with three other full-time employees. \u201cThe internet, the speed of it, our entire business revolves around that.\u201dInternet service providers say that the proposal would lead to a better variety of services for online customers and more innovation in the industry.For small businesses, a rollback could fundamentally change how, and whether, they do business.

Small enterprises would struggle to pay, leaving them at a commercial disadvantage, they said.Independent contractors like Clayton Cowles, who works in upstate New York, could also be vulnerable.Mr. Cowles draws the text for comic book publishers including Marvel, DC and Image, and has worked on Batman, Star Wars and other popular series.Each month, he pays Spectrum, his internet service provider, $90.70 for the company\u2019s most powerful service package, which is supposed to allow him to send enormous digital documents within seconds. Instead, his files sometimes take 15 minutes to be delivered, he said.A more deeply deregulated Spectrum is one of his \u201cgreatest fears,\u201d he said.\u201cThey pretty much have a monopoly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m stuck with them.\u201dA pay-for-play internet system could also be problematic for Codecademy, an education company founded in 2011.

He took her to his home in the woods, the woman says, removed both her clothes and his and then molested her.After the story\u2019s publication yesterday, the most common reaction from other Republicans was a conditional condemnation that revolved around the words \u201cif true.\u201d A spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence said, \u201cIf true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office.\u201d Mitch McConnell\u2019s statement was similar.It\u2019s a wholly insufficient response.I understand why senators might make their immediate response conditional. Maybe they didn\u2019t yet read the story. But once you have read the story, there is only one decent response: Moore, the Republican nominee to become Alabama\u2019s next senator, needs to quit the race immediately.The \u201cif true\u201d response wrongly suggests that there will be some final reckoning of facts to remove any doubt about what Moore did. But there won\u2019t be. He will likely continue denying the allegations, and people will have to choose between The Post\u2019s reams of evidence and Moore\u2019s lack of it.\u201cThe allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying. He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of.\u201dObviously not. And that appears to be the choice senators will have, based on yesterday\u2019s early news about the Senate bill.Republican Senate leaders seem to be putting together a bill designed to give huge tax cuts to the wealthy and little to the middle class. The bill would also create large budget deficits that middle-class families would ultimately have to help pay off.The Senate will probably take away a few damaging provisions from the House bill, like a higher tax rate for low-income households. But the bill still seems geared overwhelmingly to the wealthy. One centerpiece is a reduction of the estate tax, which falls on only a sliver of rich families. Another provision makes the House bill worse: a lower income tax rate for the highest earners.It is still possible for the Senate to write a bill that actually tries to clean up the tax code and make life easier on the middle class and poor. But the Senate is now a long way from doing so.I\u2019m encouraged to see several Republican senators raising concerns. Bob Corker and Jeff Flake are worried about soaring deficits. Mike Lee and Marco Rubio want a larger child tax credit. There are also multiple differences between the Senate and House bills that could be difficult to square. Any three Republicans can likely keep a damaging bill from passing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Pass-Throughs vs. Corporations \u2014 Who\u2019s the Bigger Winner?", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here are some of the stories we are watching. \u2022 One of the biggest German IPOs in years could arrive next year.Pass-throughs have a lower total tax burden than corporations do. That advantage exists now and remains in both the House and Senate versions of the tax bill.The key point here is that corporations and their investors are taxed twice:First, a corporate rate on profits is paid directly by the company. Under current law, the top rate is 35 percent. Then, when the business pays returns to its investors, they pay tax on the money they\u2019ve earned when they file in April. That income \u2014 dividends and capital gains \u2014 is taxed at a top rate of 23.8 percent.Pass-through businesses, meanwhile, are taxed just once:These are small and mammoth partnerships, proprietorships and companies with fewer than 100 shareholders known as S corporations... They aren\u2019t subjected to any separate business tax, but pay on their individual income tax when the money thrown off by the business is passed through to its owners. The rate depends on what bracket someone is in, but the highest is 39.6 percent.So while the corporate rate by itself may be lower than the top pass-through rate, the total tax burden on corporations is higher.But even in Republican rewrite of the tax code \u2014 in which the corporate rate is lowered to 20 percent \u2014 pass-throughs still come out on top. That again is because corporation are taxed twice.Six months ago, Don Blankenship \u2014 the former C.E.O. of Massey Energy and once one of the most-feared men in the coal industry \u2014 shed his label as federal inmate 12393-088.Now Mr. Blankenship, who was convicted of crimes related to the explosion at the Massey-run Upper Big Branch mine in 2010 that killed 29 men, is pursuing a new career: senator.One thing Mr. Blankenship won\u2019t have a problem with is name recognition: He\u2019s one of the best-known figures in West Virginia, both for his decade-long tenure as the C.E.O. of Massey and then for his downfall after the mine explosion.Mr. Blankenship\u2019s quasi-dictatorial management style as chief executive produced spectacular results for Massey, transforming it from a relatively modest business dominated by a single family into a corporation that operated more than 150 mines and brought in more than $2.6 billion in revenue.Mr. Blankenship was eventually convicted of having deliberately skirted federal mining safety requirements. It\u2019s a charge he has consistently denied, and he has called himself an \u201cAmerican political prisoner.\u201dThere has certainly been a lot of talk about media mergers in recent weeks.But all this news may have obscured the fact that media deal making has slowed markedly this year. So far in 2017, the value of announced media deals in 2017 is down 69 percent in the United States from a year ago and 57 percent globally, according to Thomson Reuters.The total volume of these deals is at its lowest level since 2013 in the United States and 2012 worldwide.Few, for example, believe that Comcast \u2014 which is in discussions to buy significant portions of 21st Century Fox \u2014 would be allowed to complete that potential deal unless the Justice Department was defeated in its AT&T lawsuit.So until there is a conclusion to the AT&T-Time Warner deal, big media acquisitions are likely on hold.Their shared goals: Expand Kind from being a snack maker into a health-food empire, and expand its international sales.\u201cJob No. 1 is taking it global. Job No. 2 is, what other categories either are we already in, or we can easily get into, that meet the Kind promise?\u201d Grant F. Reid, the Mars chief executive, told Andrew in an interview.____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London.____________________________The Healthineers unit is among Siemens\u2019 most profitable businesses, generating 13.8 billion euros, or about $16 billion, in revenue in the company\u2019s 2017 fiscal year, which ended in September.

Morgan are acting as global coordinators on the listing.The British cinema owner Cineworld confirmed on Wednesday that it was in advanced discussions to potentially acquire Regal Entertainment Group for about $3.1 billion.If the deal were to be completed, the two largest movie theater chains in the United States would be owned by overseas companies. AMC Entertainment is owned by the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda.The confirmation came after Regal said on Tuesday night that it was in discussions with Cineworld about an all-cash transaction to acquire Regal for $23 a share. Shares of Regal are up nearly 5 percent to $20.59 in recent trading.\u201cSo-called premium video-on-demand could see movies appear on streaming services just weeks after their theatre debuts. That would cut Ebitda by 8 percent, according to Credit Suisse, and make a Hollywood-style happy finale even less likely.\u201dAnother key part of AT&T\u2019s filingTo show that it would not abuse any increase in power that buying Time Warner would afford, AT&T said that it had offered rival distributors the same sort of deal that the government allowed in the last big vertical media merger, Comcast\u2019s purchase of NBCUniversal.That includes:\u2022 Letting rival video providers make use of arbitration in any dispute involving Turner\u2019s channels.The AT&T flyaroundA tax overhaul proposal emerged from the Senate Budget Committee after two notable Republican dissidents, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Bob Corker of Tennessee, said their concerns were resolved.The Washington flyaround\u201cThey have promised to cover it all, we don\u2019t care what they say their estimate is,\u201d said one senior E.U. diplomat. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to help them present it.\u201dReports of progress pushed up the value of the British pound this morning to about $1.34.The opposition to the F.C.C.\u2019s plans to repeal the Obama-era regulations has included more than 200,000 phone calls placed to Congress and about 500,000 comments on the F.C.C.\u2019s website.Critics\u2019 corner, F.C.C. editionBut TCI is also getting something that it had wanted, sort of: Donald Brydon, the L.S.E. chairman whom the fund wanted replaced, said that he would step down in 2019.But it\u2019s bound to get messier.

More galling, perhaps, was the implicit rebuke to their own collective marital-bed deaths. (That Ms. Waldman and Mr. Chabon had a rocking sex life may have been the greater transgression.)In coffee shops, parenting chat rooms and the studios of daytime television, Ms. Waldman was reviled as a combination of Britney Spears, Susan Smith and Medea, with a bit of Anna Karenina thrown in for good measure. Much of the opprobrium spewed from one source, \u201cNew York City\u2019s elite Bad Mother SWAT team, the warrior-shrews of UrbanBaby.com,\u201d as Ms. Waldman wrote later, referring to the cacophonous parenting site and its voluble members, who \u201csank their pointy little incisors into my metaphorical ankles.\u201dAnd the invective just kept coming. Ms. Waldman found a note on the gate of her family\u2019s Berkeley house, threatening to turn her in to social services; Star Jones took her down on \u201cThe View\u201d and Gawker began a gleeful, decade-long ribbing of the Waldman-Chabon marriage.\u201cIt was scary and it was unpleasant,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThe worst part of it was that I didn\u2019t get to plug my books. Not only that, but if you clicked on my name on Oprah\u2019s website, you went to somebody else\u2019s author page on Amazon. I really did not want to go on Oprah and talk about my sex life, but I really wanted to sell books. When does the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the literary novelist abate?\u201dStill, the essay would make her famous. Not a bad thing, Ms. Waldman admitted, for a Harvard Law School-educated former public defender who was trying to make it as a novelist and whose oeuvre at the time was a lighthearted, if not widely read, series of murder mysteries starring a former public defender turned stay-at-home mom and amateur sleuth. (She had just written a more serious novel, however, \u201cDaughter\u2019s Keeper,\u201d that explored the relationship between a mother and a daughter who faces prosecution for her connection to a drug deal; it was that book she had hoped to hawk on \u201cOprah.\u201d) That all changed, post-essay, when Ms Waldman was instantly anointed as a parenting expert, the go-to apologist for maternal ambivalence.

Not that they\u2019ve read it. They are just aware, in a general if bored way, she said, of its contention that there\u2019s a distinction between romantic and maternal love. If she has any regrets, Ms. Waldman said, these center on how her \u201chumble-brag,\u201d as she put it, would dog her. \u201cLooking back,\u201d she said, \u201cit was a little smug.\u201d She never reckoned she would be answering questions about her sex life for the next decade \u2014 and beyond.(Sorry, said this reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Ms. Waldman said.)\u201cThe essay was both a gift and a curse,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt gave me the opportunity to have a career that I don\u2019t know that I would have had. But when I wanted to write something different\u201d \u2014 when she wanted to leave the mommy track, as it were \u2014 \u201ceveryone was like, \u2018Wait a minute. You\u2019re the lady that likes her husband.\u2019\u201dOn the upside, she pointed out, in 2005, Twitter had not yet been invented. Facebook was still a social network used only by college students. \u201cI was really lucky, because this happened before the worst of the internet,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you imagine if that happened now?

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time to Tax Companies for Using Our Personal Data", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur data is valuable. Each year, it generates hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of economic activity, mostly between and within corporations \u2014 all on the back of information about each of us.It\u2019s this transaction \u2014 between you, the user, giving up details of yourself to a company in exchange for a product like a photo app or email, or a whole ecosystem like Facebook \u2014 that\u2019s worth by some estimates $1,000 per person per year, a number that is quickly rising.The value of our personal data is primarily locked up in the revenues of large corporations. Some, like data brokerages, exist solely to buy and sell sets of that data.Why should companies be the major, and often the only, beneficiaries of this largess? They shouldn\u2019t. Those financial benefits need to be shared, and the best way to do it is to impose a small tax on this revenue and use the proceeds to build a better, more equitable internet and society that benefit us all.The data tax could be a minor cost, less than 1 percent of the revenue companies earn from selling our personal data, spread out over an entire industry. Individually, no company\u2019s bottom line would substantially suffer; collectively, the tax would pull money back to the public, from an industry profiting from material and labor that is, at its very core, our own.This idea is not new. It is, essentially, a sales tax, among the oldest taxes that exist, but it hasn\u2019t been done because assigning a fixed monetary value to our data can be very difficult. For a lot of internet businesses, our personal data either primarily flows through the business or remains locked within.The flow-through type of business is an internet provider, like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon; the latter is a platform provider, like Facebook or Twitter. Google mostly makes platforms, like its search function and Gmail, but it also lays fiber-optic cable, providing the internet to some municipalities. The company also is making self-driving cars.It\u2019s perhaps easiest to consider your data as something real and physical, like a car, which, in a sense, it is. It moves around a real, physical infrastructure, owned and operated by the internet providers, and the information is also stored \u2014 or parked \u2014 on millions of hard drives in vast buildings in usually cold climes. These are owned and operated by the platform makers, including Amazon, which has a very lucrative arm that does nothing but rent out its server space.When you use the internet, your information travels through the providers\u2019 pipes (roads) and into and out of the platform makers\u2019 servers (parking lots). For the most part, the platform makers rely on your data to improve their products. Google uses its immense trove of real human searches to make better artificial intelligence like transcriptions, translations and self-driving cars.How much, exactly, these new and innovative businesses are worth is unclear even to Google. But it, and all the platform makers, don\u2019t just improve products with our data. The companies invite advertisers into the platforms, offering to deliver advertisements to exactly the right kind of person, at exactly the right time, based off the platform makers\u2019 intimate knowledge of us, via our data. The internet providers are less nuanced: We pay a monthly fee for access to the pipes the companies lay and the upkeep on them, but the companies also sell our data to brokers, who bundle and sell it to advertisers.It\u2019s this data brokerage industry that should be the primary, initial focus of the data tax. This industry exists solely to collect our information and sell it as a commodity to retailers, advertisers, marketers, even other data brokerages and government agencies.It\u2019s this marketplace that traffics in the actual monetary value of our data, and from it we can begin to map just how much that data might be worth overall.Microlevies like this one have been issued successfully before. Over the last decade, the governments of 10 countries, including Chile, France and Niger, have successfully raised more than 1 billion euros in funding from a tax on airline tickets of \u20ac1 to \u20ac40 depending on the class of ticket.The money generated has gone toward global H.I.V./AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria eradication programs. In Austria, the government was considering imposing a value-added tax on the big data transactions of social media companies that benefit from personal data, but has been stymied by the complications of assigning a fixed value to such transactions.Our data is ours, but it also is not ours. We trade it away for so much of our experience on the internet. Money from a data tax could begin to counter this trade imbalance.The money should go toward improving privacy of our information on the internet, countering identity theft, improving connectivity and internet literacy, all causes that would help create a more equitable internet for all.Saadia Madsbjerg is managing director of the Rockefeller FoundationAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Time Inc., a Jittery Reckoning on the Day After the Sale", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen employees of Time Inc. trundled into a corporate auditorium on Monday, the atmosphere was funereal.The announcement of the sale had in some ways ended years of dread inside Time Inc. The company had been floundering since it was spun off from Time Warner in 2014, and everyone who worked there had little doubt that it would eventually come under new ownership.The agreement with Meredith \u2014 the Des Moines-based publisher whose portfolio is largely focused on lifestyle magazines like Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, Parents and Family Fun \u2014 had also uncorked an existential reckoning within Time Inc.\u2019s downtown Manhattan headquarters.During two meetings held in an auditorium named for Time Inc.\u2019s illustrious co-founder Henry R. Luce, the mood grew somewhat contentious, according to people who attended. Employees demanded to know if the Kochs, the multibillionaire brothers known for throwing their weight behind conservative causes, would compromise their editorial integrity.One employee, asked Rich Battista, Time Inc.\u2019s chief executive, how much money he would personally gain from the sale. (Mr. Battista demurred, but according to regulatory filings, he could walk away with some $15 million.)\u201cIt was a once very powerful, very important, very profitable force in the global publishing industry and an important player in the journalism world,\u201d John Huey, the editor in chief of Time Inc. from 2006 to 2012, said on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s now a severely wounded animal.\u201dMeredith\u2019s top executives, however, were more upbeat. \u201cThis is truly a transformative moment for the Meredith Corporation,\u201d Stephen M. Lacy, the chief executive, said during a call with investors on Monday morning.Over the course of an hour, Mr. Lacy and other company leaders addressed questions from analysts about its strategy. While the call apparently helped electrify Wall Street \u2014 Meredith\u2019s stock price shot up more than 10 percent for the day \u2014 it did little to quell the anxiety among the people working at the company it had acquired.In an interview on Monday evening, Thomas H. Harty, Meredith\u2019s president and chief operating officer, said his company had not made any decisions about selling Time Inc. titles, though he did not reject the notion outright.\u201cWe really don\u2019t have any particular plans for any part of the portfolio yet,\u201d he said. He added that Time, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated were \u201creally iconic brands that have been underperforming.\u201dMr. Harty also said Meredith had \u201cno plans to move any editorial or sales and marketing jobs from New York\u201d and also did not expect \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d to move Time Inc. employees out of their current offices. He added that layoffs are likely at Time Inc., which has drastically reduced the size of its work force in the last decade.Meredith makes for an unlikely Time Inc. caretaker. A media company built on publications that celebrate domestic life, it has shown no past interest in current events, celebrity, sports and business \u2014 the very subjects that make up the bulk of the material in Time Inc.\u2019s best known magazines.It remains possible that Meredith will try to sell off titles including Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated after the deal closes, and some current and former Time Inc. employees have wondered whether or not the Kochs themselves may have an interest in buying them.\u201cI think if we were being a little paranoid, we would say, \u2018Yes, it sure looks like the Kochs will take those titles,\u2019\u201d Reed Phillips, a managing partner at the investment bank Oaklins DeSilva & Phillips, said. \u201cBut in reality, I don\u2019t think it will work that way.\u201dSpokesmen for Meredith and Koch Industries have said the Kochs would have no influence over the magazines. Koch Equity Development, the private equity arm of Koch Industries through which Meredith received an infusion of $650 million, will not have a board seat. Meredith said the firm would \u201chave no influence on Meredith\u2019s editorial or managerial operations.\u201dIn a merger agreement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Meredith said Koch Equity Development would meet with the company\u2019s senior management four times a year and would have the right to appoint an observer to attend board meetings, if Meredith declined to pay the firm its expected dividend.\u201cWe\u2019ve agreed to meet with them just like we do with any other Wall Street analyst,\u201d Mr. Harty said.He added that Meredith\u2019s senior management team had never discussed the deal with the Kochs themselves. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever met with the Koch brothers,\u201d he said.The sale of Time Inc. underscored how far the publisher has fallen since its days as an arbiter of American culture. From their cavernous offices within the Time-Life Building overlooking Rockefeller Center, Time Inc.\u2019s editors once commanded the attention of presidents and shaped global discourse.Time magazine made the news accessible in staccato reports. Life magazine, in its large-format heyday, captured world leaders, Hollywood stars and soldiers at war through vivid photography and silky prose. Sports Illustrated was a bible for fans of Muhammad Ali, Willie Mays and Michael Jordan.Fortune did not limit itself to industry titans but also covered people living in poverty, as it did with \u201cPeople and Places in Trouble,\u201d a photo essay by Walker Evans. And People magazine ushered in modern-day fame culture by making celebrities seem relatable and everyday people seem like stars.Time Inc. had seemingly found a way to keep itself vibrant into the new century when it merged with Warner Bros. in 1989. In 2014, however, it found itself spun off from Time Warner. Since then, it has struggled to offset steep declines in print advertising and circulation.With a scattershot business strategy, it now offers insurance for pets and a Sports Illustrated subscription streaming service for Amazon. Perhaps its biggest claim to fame in recent months was some unsolicited attention Time received from President Trump over the weekend about its \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d issue.\u201cThe reality is that it was a print company that produced great consumer brands but they were not brands for which it was easy to make a transition in an age of mobile,\u201d Norman Pearlstine, a longtime Time Inc. executive and its editor in chief from 1995 to 2005, said.\u201cYou can point to lots of things that might have been done differently or might have been done better,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure any of that could have overcome that basic reality.\u201dAndrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But the two didn\u2019t really communicate again until late Sunday, when Mr. Tan called his counterpart and told him about the impending $105 billion bid.Mr. Tan didn\u2019t rule out a proxy fight over Qualcomm: He told Michael yesterday, \u201cWe really know what our options are, and we haven\u2019t really eliminated them.\u201d But he will have to move quickly, since the deadline for nominating Qualcomm directors is in December. And then there is the question of how comfortable Silver Lake, a longtime backer that is providing $5 billion in financing, will be in supporting a hostile bid. (Silver Lake declined to comment.)Who\u2019s advising whom?Broadcom: Moelis & Company, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and the law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Latham & Watkins.Qualcomm: Goldman Sachs, Evercore Partners, Centerview Partners and the law firm Paul, Weiss.More on Broadcom and Qualcomm\u201cWe don\u2019t stash money on some Caribbean island,\u201d Tim Cook told a Senate investigative subcommittee in 2013.

{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Repeal: What Could Happen and How It Could Affect You", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s our guide for internet users looking for answers.The net neutrality rules were passed in 2015 during the Obama administration when Democrats controlled the F.C.C.The major broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast have argued that utility-style regulation represents unnecessary government meddling that will reduce their incentives to invest and improve service. The result, they say, will be worse service for everyone in the long run.The biggest concern is that the internet will become pay-to-play technology with two tiers: one that has speedy service and one that doesn\u2019t. The high-speed lane would be occupied by big internet and media companies, and affluent households. For everyone else there would be the slow lane.The brand-name internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, analysts say, will comfortably be able to pay the higher rent. It will not affect their business, though it may crimp their profits. Avoiding higher prices is one reason the major internet companies have been champions of net neutrality.That will no longer be true, Mr. Bell wrote, without net neutrality rules that \u201censure that anyone who puts something on the internet has a fair shot at finding a life-changing audience.\u201dThe government-backed guarantee of equal access is why public interest groups, nongovernmental organizations, charities and millions of private citizens wrote to the F.C.C. in support of the net neutrality rules.But the broadband and telecom companies \u2014 and some economists \u2014 say that the freedom to charge different prices for different products and services is vital to healthy markets. That kind of \u201cprice discrimination,\u201d they say, is the fuel of innovation and efficiency.In a public comment earlier this year to the F.C.C., AT&T called the Obama-era rules \u201can unprecedented regulatory overreach for which there is no economic or marketplace justification.\u201dThe F.C.C. rules mandated net neutrality principles under a utility-style telecommunications law, called Title 2, that dates to 1934. The carriers fear that it all but ensures price regulation.\u201cWhat they really object to is Title 2, not the net neutrality principles,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an independent analyst.Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who is credited with coining the phrase \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d said the repeal plan not only rolls back the Obama-era rules, it goes further. It specifically permits broadband carriers to block media content, Mr. Wu said, an added power which was not the case during the administration of George W. Bush.\u201cAn allowance of blocking is really pretty shocking.\u201d Mr. Wu said in an email.Yet if government is in retreat, then consumers are left to trust the behavior of the internet-access companies like Charter and AT&T. In their filings with the F.C.C., the companies have claimed that faith would be well founded. Market incentives, Charter told the F.C.C., push the companies to provide the best service to its customers, catering to consumer demand.Charter said it voluntarily adheres to net neutrality principles, and will continue to do so. \u201cWe do not block, throttle, or otherwise interfere with the online activity of our customers,\u201d the company said.But a weakness in the free-market argument, industry analysts say, is that in some regional and rural markets, households have only one internet provider available to them. That undermines the theory that competition will protect consumers.Roger L. Kay, an independent technology analyst, predicted that larger bills \u2014 not content blocking \u2014 would be the most likely result. If the big internet and media companies will have to pay their carriers more for high-speed services, the expenses will trickle down to households.Consumers, Mr. Kay said, \u201cwill end up paying higher prices for essentially the same service.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Evil Is Tech?", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot long ago, tech was the coolest industry. Everybody wanted to work at Google, Facebook and Apple. But over the past year the mood has shifted.Some now believe tech is like the tobacco industry \u2014 corporations that make billions of dollars peddling a destructive addiction. Some believe it is like the N.F.L. \u2014 something millions of people love, but which everybody knows leaves a trail of human wreckage in its wake.Surely the people in tech \u2014 who generally want to make the world a better place \u2014 don\u2019t want to go down this road. It will be interesting to see if they can take the actions necessary to prevent their companies from becoming social pariahs.There are three main critiques of big tech.The first is that it is destroying the young. Social media promises an end to loneliness but actually produces an increase in solitude and an intense awareness of social exclusion. Texting and other technologies give you more control over your social interactions but also lead to thinner interactions and less real engagement with the world.Eighth graders who spend 10 or more hours a week on social media are 56 percent more likely to say they are unhappy than those who spend less time. Eighth graders who are heavy users of social media increase their risk of depression by 27 percent. Teens who spend three or more hours a day on electronic devices are 35 percent more likely to have a risk factor for suicide, like making a plan for how to do it. Girls, especially hard hit, have experienced a 50 percent rise in depressive symptoms.Snapchat has Snapstreak, which rewards friends who snap each other every single day, thus encouraging addictive behavior. News feeds are structured as \u201cbottomless bowls\u201d so that one page view leads down to another and another and so on forever. Most social media sites create irregularly timed rewards; you have to check your device compulsively because you never know when a burst of social affirmation from a Facebook like may come.The third critique is that Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are near monopolies that use their market power to invade the private lives of their users and impose unfair conditions on content creators and smaller competitors. The political assault on this front is gaining steam. The left is attacking tech companies because they are mammoth corporations; the right is attacking them because they are culturally progressive. Tech will have few defenders on the national scene.Obviously, the smart play would be for the tech industry to get out in front and clean up its own pollution. There are activists like Tristan Harris of Time Well Spent, who is trying to move the tech world in the right directions. There are even some good engineering responses. I use an app called Moment to track and control my phone usage.The big breakthrough will come when tech executives clearly acknowledge the central truth: Their technologies are extremely useful for the tasks and pleasures that require shallower forms of consciousness, but they often crowd out and destroy the deeper forms of consciousness people need to thrive.Online is a place for human contact but not intimacy. Online is a place for information but not reflection. It gives you the first stereotypical thought about a person or a situation, but it\u2019s hard to carve out time and space for the third, 15th and 43rd thought.Online is a place for exploration but discourages cohesion. It grabs control of your attention and scatters it across a vast range of diverting things. But we are happiest when we have brought our lives to a point, when we have focused attention and will on one thing, wholeheartedly with all our might.Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote that we take a break from the distractions of the world not as a rest to give us more strength to dive back in, but as the climax of living. \u201cThe seventh day is a palace in time which we build. It is made of soul, joy and reticence,\u201d he said. By cutting off work and technology we enter a different state of consciousness, a different dimension of time and a different atmosphere, a \u201cmine where the spirit\u2019s precious metal can be found.\u201dImagine if instead of claiming to offer us the best things in life, tech merely saw itself as providing efficiency devices. Its innovations can save us time on lower-level tasks so we can get offline and there experience the best things in life.Imagine if tech pitched itself that way. That would be an amazing show of realism and, especially, humility, which these days is the ultimate and most disruptive technology.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Business Moguls Criticize Republican Tax Plans: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublicans\u2019 latest stab at tax reform would likely be a boon to business moguls. But not everyone is interested.\u201cYou would usually reserve tax reform of this nature for right in the midst of a recession,\u201d the billionaire said in an interview with CNBC\u2019s Leslie Picker. \u201cDo we need to cut taxes as much as we are? Probably not. Do we need to reform taxes, simply taxes, and keep America competitive. Absolutely.\u201dWhen you ran and won, you ran on draining the swamp, not giving new life to it.You ran on tax cuts, not on the swamp\u2019s idea of tax reform where special interests win.This is a plan that helps Wall Street, hedge funds, private equity managers, real estate and oil and gas partnerships and individuals who disguise income as profits or distributions.It\u2019s worth noting a couple of things:\u2022 Mr. Levine describes himself as a longstanding backer of Mr. Trump.During a conference call with analysts on Monday to discuss his company\u2019s $2.8 billion deal for Time Inc., Meredith C.E.O. Steve Lacy said of the Koch brothers\u2019 financing role:\u201cAnd their desire to be passive and not require a board seat and observer rights and all sorts of other things that we learned as we went through the process, without a doubt, made the offer from the Koch equity division of their company the most attractive.\u201dBut many in the media world have questioned whether the brothers actually will have no influence at Time Inc. publications. Among them are former editors at Time Inc. itself.Politico\u2019s Michael Calderone spoke to Richard Stengel, a former editor of Time, and John Huey, a former editor-in-chief of Time Inc.:One group that\u2019s not asking questions about the Meredith deal is Time Inc.\u2019s coterie of shareholders. Shares in the magazine publisher jumped 9 percent to $18.42 this morning on news of the transaction.In an apparent effort to win over his potential new colleagues, Mr. Mulvaney even brought a present.The conflict will ultimately come down to which statute applies to replacing now-departed director Richard Cordray: the Dodd-Frank law that created the C.F.P.B., or the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.Noah Feldman, a professor of constitutional and international law at Harvard University, argues at Bloomberg View that Ms. Engish\u2019s \u201csuit is a partisan maneuver that will detract from the seriousness of the effort to keep executive power in check where it matters.\u201d\u201cAs a general matter, the Constitution expects the president to be able to appoint the heads of agencies in the executive branch...The idea that Trump wouldn\u2019t be able to name his own acting director of the CFPB therefore contradicts basic principles of democratic legitimacy. It\u2019s at best a bug in a complex statutory scheme, not a feature. There is simply no good structural, logical, or constitutional reason why the dead hand of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration should continue to guide the CFPB once Cordray is gone.\u201dAnalysts had long seen Meredith, which publishes Family Circle and Better Homes and Gardens, as being most interested in People, Time Inc.\u2019s most profitable title. The more news-focused publications upon which Time Inc. was built, including its namesake magazine and Fortune, have traditionally been less of a focus for Meredith.If Meredith decides to sell those news publications, who would buy them? The smart money is on a vanity buyer \u2014 perhaps from the same universe of investors who are pursuing Rolling Stone, which we hear could be sold as soon as this week.The Koch angle Take note of this disclaimer about Koch Industries\u2019 private equity arm:KED will not have a seat on the Meredith board and will have no influence on Meredith\u2019s editorial or managerial operations. KED\u2019s noncontrolling, preferred equity investment underscores a strong belief in Meredith\u2019s strength as a business operator, its strategies, and its ability to unlock significant value from the Time Inc. acquisition.The Trump angleCritics cornerIs it Leandra English, the deputy director of the bureau and the chosen successor of the now-departed chief, Rich Cordray? Or is it Mick Mulvaney, appointed by Mr. Trump to lead the agency on an interim basis?The stakes were already high. Mr. Mulvaney is on record as having called the bureau a \u201csad, sick joke,\u201d leading many to suspect that, should he take charge, would seek to unwind Obama-era initiatives meant to protect financial consumers \u2014 and that have infuriated the banking and lending industries.\u201cIf there has been one consistent criticism of the CFPB, it\u2019s a lack of predictability, and we are now left with the greatest uncertainty since the bureau was established,\u201d said Ben Olson, a Buckley Sandler lawyer and a former CFPB official who advises financial companies.That\u2019s when the Senate Budget Committee is scheduled to vote on moving the proposal to the floor. Axios notes that two undecided Senate Republicans, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Bob Corker of Tennessee, sit on that committee.But the big question remains: Can the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, prevent no more than two of his colleagues from voting against the tax bill? Mr. Johnson and Steve Daines of Montana worry that the current legislation favors big corporations over small businesses. Susan Collins of Maine has expressed worry over health care and deductions for state and local taxes.The tax flyaround\u2022 Economists at Goldman reckon that the current tax proposals could prod about 2 percent to 4 percent of top earners in New York City to move elsewhere. And it could lower home prices by restricting deductions for property taxes.The digital currency rose as high as $9,682 this morning, as part of its lightning-fast ascent in value in recent weeks.

{"Headline": "Building A.I. That Can Build A.I.", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "Google and others, fighting for a small pool of researchers, are looking for automated ways to deal with a shortage of artificial intelligence experts.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 They are a dream of researchers but perhaps a nightmare for highly skilled computer programmers: artificially intelligent machines that can build other artificially intelligent machines.With it, Google may soon find a way to create A.I. technology that can partly take the humans out of building the A.I. systems that many believe are the future of the technology industry.The project is part of a much larger effort to bring the latest and greatest A.I. techniques to a wider collection of companies and software developers.The world\u2019s largest tech businesses, including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, sometimes pay millions of dollars a year to A.I. experts, effectively cornering the market for this hard-to-find talent. The shortage isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, just because mastering these skills takes years of work.This is not altruism. Researchers like Mr. Dean believe that if more people and companies are working on artificial intelligence, it will propel their own research. At the same time, companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft see serious money in the trend that Mr. Sirosh described. All of them are selling cloud-computing services that can help other businesses and developers build A.I.\u201cThere is real demand for this,\u201d said Matt Scott, a co-founder and the chief technical officer of Malong, a start-up in China that offers similar services. \u201cAnd the tools are not yet satisfying all the demand.\u201dEventually, the Google project will help companies build systems with artificial intelligence even if they don\u2019t have extensive expertise, Mr. Dean said. Today, he estimated, no more than a few thousand companies have the right talent for building A.I., but many more have the necessary data.\u201cWe want to go from thousands of organizations solving machine learning problems to millions,\u201d he said.Google is investing heavily in cloud-computing services \u2014 services that help other businesses build and run software \u2014 which it expects to be one of its primary economic engines in the years to come. And after snapping up such a large portion of the world\u2019s top A.I researchers, it has a means of jump-starting this engine.By analyzing the sounds in a vast collection of old technical support calls, for instance, a machine-learning algorithm can learn to recognize spoken words.But building a neural network is not like building a website or some run-of-the-mill smartphone app. It requires significant math skills, extreme trial and error, and a fair amount of intuition. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagn\u00e9, the chief executive of an independent machine-learning lab called Element AI, refers to the process as \u201ca new kind of computer programming.\u201dIn building a neural network, researchers run dozens or even hundreds of experiments across a vast network of machines, testing how well an algorithm can learn a task like recognizing an image or translating from one language to another. Then they adjust particular parts of the algorithm over and over again, until they settle on something that works. Some call it a \u201cdark art,\u201d just because researchers find it difficult to explain why they make particular adjustments.But with AutoML, Google is trying to automate this process. It is building algorithms that analyze the development of other algorithms, learning which methods are successful and which are not. Eventually, they learn to build more effective machine learning. Google said AutoML could now build algorithms that, in some cases, identified objects in photos more accurately than services built solely by human experts.Barret Zoph, one of the Google researchers behind the project, believes that the same method will eventually work well for other tasks, like speech recognition or machine translation.Many believe such methods will significantly accelerate the progress of A.I. in both the online and physical worlds. At the University of California, Berkeley, researchers are building techniques that could allow robots to learn new tasks based on what they have learned in the past.\u201cComputers are going to invent the algorithms for us, essentially,\u201d said a Berkeley professor, Pieter Abbeel. \u201cAlgorithms invented by computers can solve many, many problems very quickly \u2014 at least that is the hope.\u201dThis is also a way of expanding the number of people and businesses that can build artificial intelligence. These methods will not replace A.I. researchers entirely. Experts, like those at Google, must still do much of the important design work. But the belief is that the work of a few experts can help many others build their own software.Renato Negrinho, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who is exploring technology similar to AutoML, said this was not a reality today but should be in the years to come. \u201cIt is just a matter of when,\u201d he said.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a researcher for Google. He is Sergey Levine, not Levin. The caption also included an outdated credential for him. He is an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, not a post-doctoral researcher there.Advertisement"}

At 65, Linda is houseless but not, she feels, homeless. She has raised two daughters, mostly on her own, and before heading off, she slept \u2014 feeling \u201cstuck\u201d \u2014 on the living-room couch of the rented house of her daughter and three teenage grandchildren. Formerly a long-haul trucker, a Home Depot cashier, a building inspector, an I.R.S. phone rep and a co-owner of a flooring store, Linda is heading out to a $9.35-an-hour summer job as a campground \u201chost.\u201d \u201cGet paid to go camping!\u201d the concessionaire brochure reads brightly. In the San Bernardino National Forest, she will help campers with check-in, shovel broken glass from campfire pits and mostly clean 18 toilets three times a day.Moving \u201clike blood cells through the veins of the country,\u201d Jessica Bruder writes, a growing number of older people, post-recession refugees from the middle and working class, are, like Linda, crossing the land in their Jeeps, campers and repurposed buses in search of work. We meet a 67-year-old former San Francisco taxi driver who, squeezed out by Uber, unloads truckloads of sugar beets in North Dakota. We meet Chuck, a former McDonald\u2019s vice president who lost his home on a golf course in a gated community in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and now sells beer and hamburgers at spring training for the Oakland A\u2019s. We meet Don, a former software executive of 69 with a white goatee, who lost his savings in the 2008 crash and lost his house in a divorce. He now lives with his dog in a 1990 Airstream and works 12-hour shifts during the pre-Christmas season at an Amazon warehouse. Other nomads \u201cpick raspberries in Vermont, apples in Washington and blueberries in Kentucky. They give tours at fish hatcheries, take tickets at Nascar races and guard the gates of Texas oil fields.\u201d Still, it has not been easy; workers mentioned hip replacements, bad knees, a minor stroke. While many live in recreational vehicles with names like Lazy Daze, these nomads do hard work for low wages, and know how to find a free shower, cut-price dentistry and discount Viagra.In this stunning and beautifully written book, Bruder, the author of \u201cBurning Book: A Visual History of Burning Man,\u201d describes her journey with Linda and her other interviews conducted in five states over three years, with more than 50 nomads in the first year alone. Bruder also worked at a beet processing plant \u2014 \u201cBe Part of an \u2018Unbeetable\u2019 Experience!\u201d in the parlance of the recruitment brochure \u2014 and describes trying to catch large beets that flew off a processing machine as akin to \u201ccatching bowling balls in a pillowcase.\u201d After a while, she gets her own van and names it Halen.Bruder also worked at an Amazon fulfillment center, among workers in their 50s and up. \u201cWe\u2019ve had folks in their 80s who do a phenomenal job for us,\u201d one official for CamperForce, \u201ca program created by the online retailer to hire itinerant workers,\u201d said. \u201cSome walk 15 miles on concrete floors, stooping, squatting, reaching and climbing stairs as they scan, sort and box merchandise,\u201d Bruder notes. \u201cBuns of steel, here we come,\u201d an instructor tells gray-haired listeners. Amazon receives federal tax credit for hiring the \u201cdisadvantaged,\u201d which includes those on Supplemental Security Income or food stamps. The CamperForce newsletter was upbeat: \u201cMake new friends and reacquaint with old ones, share good food, good stories, and good times around the campfire, or around the table. In some ways, that\u2019s worth more than money.\u201d But nomads took the jobs for the money, toiling in warehouses where the summer heat could rise above 90 degrees and you could be asked to lift 50-pound loads. Amazon offered its workers free, over-the-counter pain-relief pills.How are we to understand the Lindas of our nation? Is she a latter-day Okie, like one of the Joads in \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d? Perhaps, but the Joads traveled together as a family, not alone. Or does Linda resemble migrant workers from Mexico or the Philippines? Like her, many travel alone, but they often do so with an eye to settlement or return. Unlike the black migrants from the South who, over decades, moved North and West during the Great Migration, Linda \u2014 like most of those profiled in Bruder\u2019s book \u2014 is white; she may fear poverty, but her migration isn\u2019t propelled by racial intimidation. Linda presumably joined black and Hispanic workers in quite a few places she worked; nearly a quarter of workers in Amazon\u2019s more than 50 warehouses across the country are black, and 12 percent Hispanic. Other of Bruder\u2019s nomads join guest workers from abroad picking fruit. Bruder wonders why the van-dwelling community itself, though, is \u201cso white.\u201d She cannot pinpoint a definitive reason among the various possibilities she raises, though she does note that \u201cliving in a vehicle seems like an especially dangerous gambit for anyone who might be a victim of racial profiling.\u201dFrom time to time, Linda meets other nomads at R.V. desert rallies. Among the largest ones is the Rubber Tramp Rendezvous near Quartzsite, Ariz., an annual winter \u201cpop-up metropolis,\u201d as Bruder calls it. There tens of thousands gather, some workers, some leisured, in small vans and large, parked snugly, not set apart by green lawns as they might be in a suburban tract. As in the community that blossoms around Burning Man festivals, a barber gives donation-optional haircuts. A woman offers banana-nut bread baked in her solar oven. Groups sit around bonfires to burn old bankruptcy papers and share hobo stew.It\u2019s hard to know how many elderly van-dwellers roam the nation. Many of Bruder\u2019s nomads had lost their homes, jobs or both in the 2008 crash. In 2010, 1,050,500 properties were repossessed. Social Security benefits are modest, Bruder reminds us, especially for women. She also tells us that, at the time of her writing, there were only a dozen American counties and one metro area where a person working full time at minimum wage could afford a one-bedroom apartment at fair market rent.What forces set these nomads in motion? Here I wish Bruder had given us a view from beyond the driver\u2019s seat. For years, stockholders have taken the lion\u2019s share of rising corporate profits, leaving a shrinking share to the middle- and working-class worker. The current administration and Congress aim to cut the nation\u2019s safety net and to loosen regulations on banks, stirring fears of another devastating crash. The stage seems set to leave Americans on their own to travel a potentially bumpy economic road, a scene that would seem to fly in the face of the picket-fence stability and localism bandied about in conservative rhetoric. Republicans like to talk about \u201cfreedom,\u201d but the tax reform they\u2019re currently proposing would most likely widen the gap between rich and poor even further, reducing Linda\u2019s freedom to stay put if she wanted to.To Linda, the American dream has been whittled down to self-sufficiency and the open road. The tires on her Jeep are worn thin, the \u201ccheck engine\u201d gauge doesn\u2019t work, and she suffers occasional dizzy spells. Her gumption and work ethic seem so admirable, but her van and her health seem so precarious, her hopes so vulnerable to fate.The Lindas of America are largely invisible. When Bruder drove her own van home to Brooklyn, she began to notice vans she hadn\u2019t noticed before \u2014 parked on a residential street, in a gas station, a store lot. As I reluctantly put down this brilliant and haunting book, I thought back to the vagabond songwriter and musician Woody Guthrie, who fled the great Oklahoma Dust Bowl of the 1930s, later riding the rails and singing, \u201cFrom the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters / This land was made for you and me.\u201d Those huge, billowing clouds of topsoil that drove millions from their homes now seem safely tucked away in sepia-tinted photos of a bygone past. But without ominous clouds above to warn us of what lies ahead, the powerful force of automation and the destruction of any safety net may silently push more and more of us onto the open road.Arlie Russell Hochschild\u2019s most recent book, \u201cStrangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right,\u201d was a finalist for the National Book Award.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tale of My Life (or Yours)", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJacqueline Tulane Vincent was a week shy of her fifth birthday when her father, Dr. Ubert Conrad Vincent, 46, died of stomach cancer in 1938.As Ms. Vincent grew up in the family home in New York City, her mother, Naomi Tulane Vincent, often told her and her three siblings about their father\u2019s history.He was the son of a North Carolina minister, and he had dreamed of becoming a doctor. Despite his father\u2019s protests, he paid his own way through the University of Pennsylvania medical school by working as a railway porter for the Pullman-Standard Co. Before graduating in 1918, the budding urologist pioneered a surgical technique to repair a set of veins that drain blood from the testes. He went on to become the first African-American physician to practice medicine at Bellevue Hospital in New York City.These are just a handful of the anecdotes that appear in \u201cThe Illustrious Doctor of Harlem,\u201d an 88-page book published in September and now available on Amazon. The book bears Ms. Vincent\u2019s byline, but it was ghostwritten by Henry Dotson on behalf of Story Terrace, a 3-year-old London-based company that creates 50- to 125-page custom books for people who want to share their life stories.Ms. Vincent, who has glaucoma, had tried and failed to produce a written narrative of her father\u2019s achievements. \u201cI\u2019d been talking about it for so many years and had promised my mother I would do it,\u201d the 83 year old said in a phone conversation from her home in Sun City, Ariz. \u201cBut I can\u2019t use the computer because of my failing sight.\u201dWhen her son, Dr. R. Conrad Bingham, a dentist in the Phoenix area, discovered Story Terrace through an online search, he knew he \u201chad to make this happen for her,\u201d he said.\u201cMy grandfather went unrecognized for his accomplishments,\u201d Mr. Bingham said. \u201cI wanted to be able to share them with my kids.\u201dThe Story Terrace founder, Rutger Bruining, felt the same way. His grandfather, a member of the Dutch resistance during World War II, died before Mr. Bruining had a chance to record his memories. The experience left him wondering \u201cwhy we don\u2019t capture the stories of the people we care about the most,\u201d he said.The former management consultant realized he could help people do just that by using online platforms such as Freelancer.com, which makes it easy and economical to find writers willing to take on such commissions.\u201cMillions of people are trying to write their own memoirs and most of them don\u2019t finish the job,\u201d Mr. Bruining said. \u201cWe\u2019re offering a service: Stories of life, of love or loss, whether it\u2019s small or big \u2014 if they\u2019re real and well-written and the voice of the customer comes through, you create something really unique and beautiful.\u201dStory Terrace offers three packages priced from $1,700 to $6,500, with prices for special commissions on application. Costs depend on the length of the book, the time allotted to interviewing, the number of photographs that are included and whether the client chooses from the company\u2019s pools of junior, senior or what it calls \u201ccritically acclaimed\u201d writers (those who have had books produced by major publishers or regularly write for nationally distributed newspapers and magazines).The entry-level Compact package, for example, ranges from $1,700 to $2,600 and includes three to four hours of interviews to produce a book that has 33 pages of text totaling 7,500 words and is illustrated by as many as 20 photographs, for a total of 55 to 60 pages. The most expensive, Novella, priced from $5,100 to $6,500, offers eight to 10 hours of interviews to produce 90 pages of text with 20,000 words and as many as 40 photographs, for a total of 115 to 125 pages. All packages include four hardback copies of the completed book as well as a digital version.Harrods in London became Story Terrace\u2019s first brick-and-mortar retailer in 2016. The third-floor concession offers some special selections, including a \u201cmessage in a bottle,\u201d in which a Story Terrace writer interviews the client, either at Harrods or at home, and produces a letter that is presented as a scroll inside a glass bottle, for 250 pounds ($330); and an art book memoir, a large-format coffee table size book, which ranges from \u00a38,750 to \u00a317,500 pounds and comes in a large-format coffee-table book size. Those customers have the option of working with photographers from Magnum Photos, the well-known cooperative.\u201cOur clients relish the idea that they can create a bespoke book, whether it be a coffee-table style book focusing on their adventures at work or play or a book about their life to pass on to future generations,\u201d said Annalise Fard, director of the home department at Harrods.The process of creating a book typically requires at least 12 weeks, from start to finish. Books are available only in English, but Story Terrace is shortly sending its first Spanish book to the printers, Mr. Bruining said.In addition to the time and the cost, \u201cone of the main objections people have is: \u2018My life is really not that interesting,\u2019 \u201d said Claudio Tapia, a novelist based in Amsterdam who is working on his fifth memoir for Story Terrace. \u201cBut I\u2019ve found that that\u2019s not true.\u201dHe referred to one of his first Story Terrace projects, in which he worked with a Dutch nobleman who had inherited a castle that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe used as the location for his play about the mythical Dr. Johann Georg Faust.\u201cThe essence of the client\u2019s story was he had lived through a Faustian dilemma: He was offered a lot of money to sell the property but he\u2019d promised his aunt he\u2019d defend it, keep it in the family \u2014 and he stuck to his promise,\u201d Mr. Tapia said.\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a boring life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Revolution at Etsy", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe first time Josh Silverman addressed the staff of Etsy as their newly installed chief executive, he tried to connect with a work force known for its diversity, idealism and sincerity.\u201cHello,\u201d he said. \u201cMy name is Josh. I identify as male. My preferred pronouns are \u2018him\u2019 and \u2018he.\u2019 Most people just call me Josh.\u201dIt was May 3, and Mr. Silverman was speaking to a roomful of traumatized employees. The day before, Etsy had fired 80 people, the first big layoffs at the online marketplace for handmade and vintage arts and crafts. Among those ousted was Etsy\u2019s beloved chief executive of six years, Chad Dickerson.Now Mr. Silverman \u2014 an Etsy board member but an unknown to most employees \u2014 stood in the Etsytorium, trying to win over a hostile crowd. His earnest introduction was an olive branch of sorts, an effort to signal that he was attuned to Etsy\u2019s vibrant gay and transgender community, and would be respectful of the company\u2019s distinctive culture. But to many in attendance, his remarks came off as tone deaf, and his inability to read the room foreshadowed sweeping changes that would soon transform Etsy.On the same day as the chief executive changeover, the company announced its first layoffs. Within weeks of assuming control, Mr. Silverman shut down several projects that had been in the works for months. Not long after that, he fired another 140 employees.It was a dizzying series of events at a company that has long held itself up as a paragon of righteous business practices. Etsy\u2019s founders believed its business model \u2014 helping mostly female entrepreneurs make a living online \u2014 was inherently just. Employees shared their emotions freely, often crying at the office. Perks included generous paid parental leave, free organic food and a pet-friendly workplace. Etsy was certified as a B Corp by a nonprofit called B Lab, denoting its particularly high social and environmental standards.But once Etsy went public in 2015, it was evaluated just like any other company traded on the stock market. By late last year, expenses were growing fast. And even as the company reported $88 million in revenues during the third quarter, it posted a net loss of $2.5 million. After a few quarters of tepid results, investors grew impatient and a classic clash of corporate governance came spilling into view \u2014 how would a company like Etsy balance the short-term demands of its shareholders with its high-minded long-term mission?By some important metrics, Etsy appears to be improving under Mr. Silverman\u2019s leadership. Revenues are up, as are \u201cgross merchandise sales\u201d \u2014 the total value of goods being sold on Etsy. The company\u2019s stock has risen about 50 percent in the six months since he took over.By other measures, however, Etsy is barely recognizable. The \u201cValues-Aligned Business\u201d team, which oversaw the company\u2019s social and environmental efforts, was dismantled. A new focus on profitability has sapped many employees of their enthusiasm. A workplace that once encouraged workers to express their feelings has clammed up. Etsy is no longer a B Corp.Today, as Mr. Silverman continues to push for change and investors keep close watch on the stock, what\u2019s most frustrating to some close observers of the company is that Etsy seems to have given up so much to gain so little.As Etsy grew, it eschewed traditional corporate customs in favor of a more freewheeling approach. Building consensus was more important than moving fast. Employees believed Etsy could be equally beneficial to buyers, sellers, staff and the planet. The idealism was infectious, and many people turned down higher salaries from other companies to work for Etsy.Yet for all its efforts to stand apart, Etsy followed the established playbook when it came to financing its growth. Venture capitalists poured some $85 million into the company, making a takeover or initial public offering all but inevitable.In 2011, the board decided to replace Mr. Kalin with Mr. Dickerson, who was then the chief technology officer. As C.E.O., Mr. Dickerson oversaw dramatic growth. When he took Etsy public in 2015, the company had 1.4 million active sellers, nearly 20 million buyers and had gross merchandise sales of $2 billion a year.True to form, Etsy found ways to make its initial public offering inclusive. It marketed shares to small investors and Etsy sellers and tried to concentrate shares in a smaller than usual number of institutional holders. Besides upholding the company\u2019s egalitarian ethos, the effort had a strategic rationale. The hope was that such a shareholder base might insulate Etsy from some of the short-term pressures of the stock market.Yet even as Etsy grew to number more than 1,000 staffers, the company\u2019s unorthodox culture survived. Mr. Dickerson held weekly \u201cOffice Hours,\u201d when any employee could ask him about anything, and spoke openly about his doubts, admitting when he didn\u2019t know the answer to a question.The emotional, individualistic culture had its drawbacks. The emphasis on go-it-alone craftsmanship meant Etsy managed its own data centers, instead of using more efficient options like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. With everyone empowered to express themselves, there was a lot of sharing going on. Inboxes were stuffed with unnecessary emails, which dragged on productivity.Mr. Silverman said he came to his first board meeting prepared to listen. But in the Etsy boardroom, seated around a large custom-made table featuring gold inlay, a large owl sculpture looming over the directors, he said he was troubled by what he heard from Mr. Dickerson. Expenses were growing faster than revenues. Sales on the site were up, but the rate of growth was slowing.As Mr. Dickerson tried to move the meeting on to topics including international expansion, Mr. Silverman spoke up. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re big at all,\u201d he told the board. \u201cWe\u2019re at the early stages.\u201dMr. Silverman pressed Mr. Dickerson to get more aggressive about the rate of growth, and called for a renewed focus on increasing sales. Privately, he came away concerned about the company\u2019s trajectory. \u201cThere was not a sense of crisis,\u201d Mr. Silverman said.\u201cThe house was burning and nobody was paying attention,\u201d said Fred Wilson, the co-founder of Union Square Ventures, which was an early investor in Etsy, and the board chairman. \u201cChad got the company about as far as he was going to get it. We needed somebody to take it to the next level.\u201dInstead of the soft skills that Mr. Dickerson brought, the board wanted someone with experience in marketing, software and e-commerce, someone who was comfortable at a big public company. In other words, someone like Mr. Silverman.At 4 p.m. on Tuesday, May 2, Mr. Dickerson called an emergency meeting in the Etsytorium, a cavernous conference room inside headquarters. Usually a loose public speaker, Mr. Dickerson read from a script, his voice shaking as he made an announcement: He was laying off 80 employees \u2014 the largest cuts in Etsy\u2019s history. And, he said, he had been fired by the board.Mr. Dickerson broke into tears, and sat down to steady himself. Many in the audience openly wept.Mr. Dickerson had learned that he was being replaced only days earlier, and his termination was effective immediately. Even by the unsentimental standards of corporate America, it was an abrupt transition. That night, a large contingent went drinking at local beer garden.The next morning, Mr. Dickerson, Mr. Silverman and Mr. Wilson all addressed the company. Mr. Dickerson told the crowd he was hung over. Mr. Wilson made some perfunctory remarks. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to blame anyone for this decision, I want you to blame me,\u201d he said.Finally, Mr. Silverman took the microphone, addressing his new staff for the first time. After introducing himself (and noting his gender), Mr. Silverman spoke about his background and experience. He said he wanted to preserve what was best about Etsy and help the company grow.When he began taking questions, the room turned hostile.\u201cYesterday felt impersonal, unempathetic and decidedly un-Etsy,\u201d the first employee said, according to a recording of the meeting. \u201cWhat is the new leadership planning to do to earn our trust and maintain the empathetic and human culture that is the entire reason that many of us chose to work here?\u201d\u201cTrust is earned, not granted,\u201d Mr. Silverman replied. \u201cKeep an open mind, and we\u2019ll get to know each other.\u201dEmployees saw Mr. Dickerson one last time. The next Friday, he came back to the office to give a Last Lecture, a traditional Etsy send-off. Mr. Dickerson spoke openly about his personal life and his time with Etsy. Everybody cried.Mr. Silverman wasted no time making changes. His sole focus, he said, was speeding up the pace of sales growth.He identified 30 projects that had the best chance of boosting sales on the site. Etsy began giving buyers more assurances, telling them that it didn\u2019t share credit card information with sellers, and that the company would refund their purchases if something went wrong. It began encouraging sellers to compare prices before listing an item. And for the first time, Etsy is running sales and promoting the holidays. Each of these changes, Mr. Silverman said, resulted in modest but measurable sales increases.Not everything worked. A move to display all-inclusive pricing, instead of the cost of the good and shipping separately, hurt sales and upset sellers. And a new way of displaying search filters didn\u2019t move the needle. \u201cMore than half of the things we try don\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying things.\u201dOther projects were shut down. Etsy Studio, a new marketplace for arts and crafts supplies that had consumed significant resources, was sidelined. Plans for further international expansion were put on hold. A marketing campaign was scrapped.At the same time, Mr. Silverman began redrawing what he said was a convoluted organizational chart. Too many people were managers, he said, and too many managers had too few reports. On June 21, less than two months after taking over, Mr. Silverman announced another, larger round of layoffs.Despite the tumult, Mr. Silverman said progress was being made as small tweaks to the site began to pay off. \u201cWe subtracted people and we\u2019re getting a lot more done,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more focus, a lot more urgency.\u201dSeveral current Etsy employees said they appreciated a new sense of direction and accountability, and that the company was becoming more innovative. \u201cThe tolerance for risk has gone up significantly,\u201d said Linda Kozlowski, the chief operating officer. \u201cThere\u2019s been a cultural shift of accountability in a good way.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re doing their best to mimic eBay and Amazon,\u201d said Amy Stringer-Mowat, co-founder of American Heirloom, a Brooklyn company that makes customized bamboo cutting boards. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bite the hand that feeds you, but that\u2019s the best way to describe how I feel about what\u2019s going on.\u201dMs. Stringer-Mowat\u2019s company got started on Etsy, but she said sales on the site have slumped in recent months. She stopped hearing from Etsy employees in the marketing department who had helped her promote her business, and she said Etsy was pressuring her to offer cheaper shipping rates, which cuts into her profits.Mr. Silverman insists Etsy is still a mission-driven company. Many of the perks remain in place, and the company is lobbying in Washington, including for the protection of net neutrality. But Mr. Silverman says Etsy\u2019s greatest potential for impact is helping sellers \u2014 many of whom are women running small businesses \u2014 increase their sales. \u201cThe company had the best of intentions, but wasn\u2019t great at tying that to impact,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cBeing good doesn\u2019t cut the mustard.\u201dOn the afternoon of Nov. 6, Etsy reported strong quarterly earnings. Sales, revenues and adjusted profits were all up. In after-hours trading, Etsy shares spiked. When the markets opened the next morning, however, the stock slumped. The results, fine as they were, were not good enough.Three days later, Mr. Silverman was back in the Etsytorium, addressing his staff. The quarter was proof that changes to the company were paying off, he said, suggesting that the tumult of the past six months had not been in vain. \u201cThe quarter that we just reported, that you all worked so hard to deliver, means so much to Etsy and to all the people who rely on us,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cI\u2019m super fired up.\u201dEtsy will likely grow with Mr. Silverman as chief executive, but it may never again be the sensitive community fostered by Mr. Kalin and nurtured by Mr. Dickerson. Once a beacon of socially responsible business practices with a starry-eyed work force that believed it could fundamentally reimagine commerce, Etsy has over the past year become a case study in how the short-term pressures of the stock market can transform even the most idealistic of companies.\u201cThere\u2019s only so much wiggle room as a public company,\u201d said Mr. Stinchcomb, the early employee. \u201cIf you really want to build a company that works for people and the planet, capitalism isn\u2019t the solution.\u201dMr. Wilson, the chairman of the board, dismisses that as sentimental hooey.\u201cTo all the people who say taking Etsy public was a mistake, I say that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201c There are some people who will say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not right for me. I like the old culture.\u2019 Well, I\u2019m sorry about that. Going public was the best thing that ever happened to this company.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Big Retailers Are Still Betting On Brick and Mortar", "Date": "2017-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne morning last month, Target\u2019s chief executive, Brian Cornell, stood amid racks of designer T-shirts and a cooler filled with prepackaged sandwiches in a store in Midtown Manhattan.\u201cThis is really a symbol of the future,\u201d he said.Mr. Cornell wasn\u2019t talking about an e-commerce warehouse staffed by robots. Nor was he speaking into a voice-activated device that knows just how much toilet paper a customer needs.He was discussing Target\u2019s new store near Herald Square in New York City, down the block from Macy\u2019s flagship store and other national retail chains. It is one of about 130 smaller format stores Target has opened or plans to open by the end of 2019. The new stores are scaled back versions of the big-box Targets that predominate in the suburbs.The company\u2019s store strategy stands out at a time when just about everyone seems to be questioning the relevance of brick-and-mortar retail. Amazon is seizing an ever-larger share of consumers\u2019 wallets, reducing foot traffic to stores.Such pressures have contributed to a string of recent retail bankruptcies, including Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Payless, Gymboree and Radio Shack. Sears and Macy\u2019s have also been closing hundreds of stores around the country as they struggle with slipping sales.But for all the gloomy uncertainty that surrounds the industry\u2019s future, stores will most likely remain at the heart of retailing for a long time \u2014 even as they evolve to meet the demands of the modern shopper.In August, TJX said that over the \u201clong term\u201d there was an opportunity to open as many as 5,600 stores, up from the roughly 4,050 the retailer currently operates globally.\u201cWe continue to see store openings as an attractive investment and a very good use of capital,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Ernie Herrman, told investors on a conference call.While discounters like TJX operate in a sort of an oasis, many other retailers face a conundrum. While retailers are plowing more money into their digital operations, they risk rendering their stores even less attractive to shoppers by starving them of investment.\u201cThe big challenge is how do you get customers to come into a store if they don\u2019t have to,\u201d said Melina Cordero, head of retail research for Americas at CBRE, the real estate firm.Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, has slowed its brick-and-mortar expansion, though it continues to open stores, particularly smaller format ones. The company is also using its vast store network \u2014 located in nearly every corner of the country \u2014 to support its e-commerce business.Walmart gives discounts to customers who order certain items on the company\u2019s website and then pick them up in the stores. The company has converted thousands of workers into \u201cpersonal shoppers\u201d who pick out groceries for customers who order them online and drive to the store to pick them up.Even as it expands its digital offerings, Walmart is also trying to generate more buzz around its stores, which had drawn complaints from some customers in recent years for being too cavernous and unpleasant to shop in.This month, Walmart is holding holiday parties \u2014 complete with toy demonstrations and workers in reindeer hats \u2014 as it \u201ccranks up the volume on store experiences.\u201dOnline retailers like Amazon face high transportation costs, particularly as they guarantee free two-day and even same-day delivery. They are also bearing the cost of processing free returns.Many analysts and retail executives said Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods and its more than 460 stores validated the relevance of brick and mortar.Still, e-commerce continues to grow at a blistering rate, far outpacing the increase in overall retail sales. Unless that growth abates, analysts and economists question how so many stores \u2014 from suburban malls to hip boutiques \u2014 can survive.\u201cE-commerce is putting extreme pressure on brick and mortar,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThis really feels like a watershed moment.\u201dTarget is betting its stores will win out. It boosted sales at each renovated store by as much as 4 percent, said Mr. Cornell, the C.E.O. The company now fulfills about 50 percent of its customers\u2019 online orders from its stores.Target also recently said that it was raising its starting wage to $11 an hour and planned to increase it to $15 by 2020 \u2014 part of an effort to attract and motivate its workers to offer strong customer service.\u201cOur stores are our core strength,\u201d Mr. Cornell said.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of stores that TJX currently operates globally. It is roughly 4,050, not 1,700.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Get High Marks for Covering Infertility Treatments", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserA relatively small number of companies offer generous benefits for infertility treatment to employees, while most have minimal or no coverage, a new report found.It\u2019s a case of \u201chaves and have-nots,\u201d said Jake Anderson, a founder of FertilityIQ, the start-up that wrote the report.It found that technology companies as well as employers in consulting and banking tended to offer generous coverage for costly assisted-reproduction techniques like in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F.FertilityIQ was founded by Mr. Anderson and Deborah Bialis, a married couple who saw a need for more detailed information after undergoing treatment for infertility themselves. FertilityIQ gathers information from more than 10,000 verified I.V.F. patients who contribute to its database. Employers examined in the report included companies where FertilityIQ\u2019s participants work, as well as additional employers identified by fertility clinics or researched by Fertility IQ itself, Mr. Anderson said.FertilityIQ\u2019s goal is to provide as much detail as possible, he said, to help people navigate their way through a stressful process. Mr. Anderson\u2019s advice to those seeking infertility treatment was simply, \u201cBuckle in, financially and emotionally.\u201dEmployer benefits are important, the couple said, because I.V.F. is costly and demand for it is increasing.Treatment isn\u2019t cheap. The cost of a single cycle of I.V.F. is often about $12,000, but that number is just a start. Drugs and related procedures, like genetic screening, push the average price in most major metropolitan areas to well above $20,000 per cycle, FertilityIQ found. And most couples undergo at least two cycles on average, Mr. Anderson said.The report ranks individual employers and broad sectors, based on criteria that include the value of the benefits and the ease with which employees can use them. Some companies rank higher because they avoid preauthorization rules, like trying unsuccessfully to conceive for a period of time or receiving a specific infertility diagnosis, that can be particularly restrictive for same-sex couples or single women, Mr. Anderson said.The technology industry, in particular, shines at making infertility benefits widely accessible, the report found, and some employers are in a sort of benefits arms race, offering more generous coverage to remain competitive in recruiting and retaining workers. Facebook ranks high on the list of tech companies, as it did in FertilityIQ\u2019s report last year. The company covers up to four I.V.F. cycles, including genetic testing, with no preapproval required. (FertilityIQ values the cycles at $25,000 each, for a total benefit value of $100,000.)Other tech companies are beefing up coverage, according to the new analysis.Microsoft is expanding its benefit in January, replacing a fixed amount of $15,000 with a more flexible offering. \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re providing industry-leading benefits,\u201d said Sonja Kellen, director of global health and wellness benefits at Microsoft.Microsoft will work with Progyny, a fertility benefits manager, to offer up to three treatment cycles. The benefit includes genetic testing as well as the freezing of eggs or embryos and storage for up to four years. The new policy makes treatment available to employees without demonstrated infertility issues, so gay couples pursuing parenthood through surrogacy or a single woman who wants to freeze eggs for use in the future can use the benefit.The new approach aims to make benefits more broadly available and helps reduce pressure on employees undergoing I.V.F. to maximize their benefit, Ms. Kellen said.For instance, a couple undergoing I.V.F. with a dollar cap on their employer benefit may decide to have multiple embryos transferred at one time, perhaps resulting in twins or triplets. Those pregnancies are more likely to have complications.Medications for the treatment are covered separately, through the company\u2019s prescription drug benefit, she said.Pinterest, the online social network, covered up to $20,000 for treatment costs this year, but will change its benefit in January to cover up to four rounds of I.V.F., said a company spokeswoman, Malorie Lucich. The expansion, she said, was based on feedback the company received from its 1,200 employees.\u201cIt\u2019s a very family friendly culture here,\u201d she said.Among other big tech companies, Google covers three cycles including genetic testing, a benefit that FertilityIQ values at $75,000, and Apple offers a $20,000 benefit. Neither company requires preapproval. Amazon\u2019s benefit of $15,000 with a required preauthorization placed it relatively low on FertilityIQ\u2019s list of tech companies.Some companies in consulting, like Bain, and finance, like Bank of America, offer unlimited I.V.F. benefits as long as employees meet preauthorization rules, the report found.Other financial companies offer more limited coverage, yet are moving to expand it. American Express, for instance, increased its cap for treatment this year to $35,000, up from $20,000, for full-time and part-time employees.Retail companies generally rank low on FertilityIQ\u2019s list, Mr. Anderson said, but Starbucks is notable for making a $15,000 I.V.F. benefit available, including to part-time store workers.Here are some questions and answers about infertility coverage:What should I do if my employer doesn\u2019t offer I.V.F. benefits?Employees can lobby their human resources departments to offer coverage, particularly if their employers are \u201cself insured\u201d \u2014 meaning the companies pay claims themselves, rather than paying a premium to an insurer, said Barbara Collura, president and chief executive of Resolve, an infertility support and advocacy group.Self-insured employers \u2014 typically companies with more than 250 workers \u2014 have more leeway to expand coverage, Ms. Collura said. Employers that don\u2019t self-insure have less flexibility because the benefits are determined by the insurer, she said.Eights states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island) require employers to offer some level of I.V.F. benefit, Ms. Collura said. But coverage isn\u2019t necessarily generous, and self-insured employers and small employers are typically exempt from the laws.Is financial help available for the cost of infertility treatment?What proportion of employers over all offer I.V.F. benefits?About a quarter of employers with 500 or more workers cover the procedure, while 37 percent of employers with 20,000 or more workers cover it, according to a 2017 report from the benefits consultant Mercer \u2014 about the same level found the previous year.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Revealing Spin on the \u2018Sharing Economy\u2019", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyFor decades after its Communist revolution in 1949, China was known as \u201cthe kingdom of bicycles.\u201d The one-speed Flying Pigeons that swarmed the streets were not simply a cheap mode of transportation. They were symbols of a shared aspiration. Along with a radio, a watch and a sewing machine, a bicycle was one of four possessions \u2014 known as sanzhuan yixiang, or \u201cthree rounds and sound\u201d \u2014 that urban Chinese families felt they needed to be part of the modern world. By the time I joined the masses in 2001, cycling across Beijing for daily Mandarin classes, cars had begun to displace bicycles. Pedaling alongside my fellow commuters \u2014 students, workers, pensioners \u2014 I felt part of a communal experience that might soon be gone forever.I was wrong, of course. China\u2019s cities are suddenly teeming with bicycles, and the humble one-speed, that remnant of China\u2019s collective memory, again serves as more than just a means of conveyance. It is now a digital device too, helping shape one of China\u2019s most dynamic growth engines \u2014 the so-called sharing economy. Three years ago, bike-sharing didn\u2019t exist in China. Today more than 40 companies offer the service. And the top two alone, Mobike and Ofo, handle more than 50 million rides every day, solving the \u201clast mile\u201d problem of getting people from public transportation to their homes.China\u2019s bike-sharing explosion is driven by digital innovations that make renting \u201cdockless\u201d bikes easy, cheap and completely cool. All it takes is a smartphone: to find the nearest bike via GPS, to scan its QR code and open its smartlocks and to pay a minuscule fee (usually 15 cents or less per ride) through a mobile-payment app. At the end, the bikes can be left almost anywhere. (In the United States, bicycles often need to be picked up and returned to a fixed dock, as with New York\u2019s Citi Bike.) For a generation of consumers conditioned to adapt to new things, the draw is no longer the pride of ownership but has become convenience and cachet. For the companies and, more pointedly, the Chinese government, the potential windfall comes not so much from profits, which remain elusive, but from the consumer data produced by every transaction.The state-run press agency, Xinhua, has trumpeted bike-sharing as one of China\u2019s \u201cfour great new inventions.\u201d (The other three are mobile payments, e-commerce and high-speed rail.) It may sound absurd to compare a dockless bike to the world-changing inventions of China\u2019s past: paper, gunpowder, the compass and movable type. But the boast conveys the importance that Beijing assigns the \u201csharing economy\u201d in helping China make the leap from a manufacturing-based to a service-oriented economy. Last year, according to government figures, China\u2019s sharing economy accounted for more than $500 billion in transactions involving roughly 600 million people. (An estimated 55 million Americans will use a sharing service this year, according to a CBS report.) And with Beijing planning on an annual 40 percent growth rate, officials are commanding this new economic engine to account for 10 percent of the national gross domestic product by 2020 and 20 percent by 2025.In this frenzy, investors have thrown millions of dollars at almost any venture with a \u201csharing\u201d label, from basketballs and refrigerators to luxury handbags and phone chargers. Not all the ideas fare well. The Shared Girlfriend sex-doll service, for example, was shut down in September in response to a public outcry. The police also forced a Beijing company to stop renting out \u201cnapping capsules,\u201d condemning them as fire hazards. Other ideas, on closer inspection, hardly look innovative. The \u201cshared bookstore\u201d is really just a lending library. And the \u201cshared washing-machine service\u201d \u2014 isn\u2019t that a laundromat?China\u2019s sharing economy has veered sharply away from how the term was originally defined: as a peer-to-peer exchange of underutilized goods and services. In China, \u201csharing\u201d now means almost any short-term rental of a product or service activated by a smartphone. Moreover, the things on offer, like Ofo\u2019s 6.5 million bikes, are not spread out among individuals but are owned by the tech companies themselves. The same is true for the spoils, from revenue to data. As a result, the ideals that still animate the concept in many other places \u2014 the reallocation of unused resources and the community that forms around it \u2014 are essentially absent in China. \u201cI was thrilled when I first heard China was so committed to the sharing economy,\u201d says April Rinne, an adviser who is a member of China\u2019s National Sharing Economy Commission. \u201cBut it\u2019s all so transactional, and the definition of sharing has gotten so broad that it\u2019s almost meaningless. As China defines it, even Amazon would be part of the sharing economy.\u201dWho can blame China for hanging on to the term \u201csharing economy\u201d? It fits with the image that Beijing wants to project: warm, generous, egalitarian. Robin Li, the chief executive of the internet giant Baidu, said last year that \u201cthe idea of a sharing economy is quite similar to that of a communist society,\u201d because both focus on \u201cdistribution according to need.\u201d A strategic planner at the advertising firm Havas Worldwide waxed so rhapsodic in a commentary about \u201cthe close-knit comradeship\u201d of Chinese consumers that it seemed the idea of sharing was itself a Chinese invention. \u201cThere is almost a sense of nobility garnered by having the means to own something yet deciding to share instead,\u201d the author wrote. The prize for puffery, however, goes to The People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, which in August celebrated umbrella-sharing enterprises as \u201ca show of human care, releasing the warmth of the city.\u201d A few weeks after that, nearly all 300,000 umbrellas distributed by a new company called Sharing E Umbrella had been either lost or stolen.None of China\u2019s bike-sharing companies are turning a profit yet. But even as they fight for market share, the data is the destination. \u201cCollecting data is the first goal of the sharing economy,\u201d says William Chou, the head of Deloitte\u2019s telecoms, media and technology practice in China. Every time consumers scan the QR code on a bicycle \u2014 or basketball, handbag, umbrella \u2014 they provide information about habits, locations, behaviors and payment histories. That\u2019s invaluable not just to Tencent and Alibaba but also to city planners seeking precise information about where to build roads, bridges and subways. \u201cThe fight is no longer over who has the biggest fleet,\u201d Towson says, \u201cbut who has the smartest fleet.\u201dThose are the benign side-effects of the sharing economy. But what happens as this data filters into China\u2019s new social-credit system, which promises to rate every individual by her financial, social and political worth? In fact, Beijing has authorized Tencent and Alibaba to conduct social-credit pilot testing, and their bikes serve as the perfect vehicles. There are no walls of privacy. The government has the ability to access company data, good or bad, faster than you can scan a QR code.One morning recently in Shanghai, I caught a glimpse of some suspicious behavior. I was walking down a tranquil, tree-lined street when a muscular man lumbered past carrying two orange-and-silver Mobikes. As he swept by, a wheel touched the ground and set off an alarm, causing him to heave the bikes even higher in the air. The man was not a bike enthusiast, but he wasn\u2019t a thief, either. As I watched him slip down a side alley and emerge moments later empty-handed, I realized that he was a foot soldier in the bike-sharing wars, dumping competitors\u2019 bikes in hard-to-find places. Rounding the corner, I saw the result of his handiwork: a sea of bikes in almost every hue. Yet not a single orange-and-silver Mobike was in sight.An earlier version of this article transliterated incorrectly a Chinese term that means \u201cthree rounds and sound.\u201d That term is sanzhuan yixiang, not sanshengyixiang.Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

When Rachel Brosnahan, who is 27 and not a comic but now plays one on Amazon Prime, walked into her audition for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d she could barely see straight. She was, as she told me, \u201cprobably deathly ill,\u201d but she had no intention of canceling the meeting. For one thing, she had already pushed back her flight once, hoping her illness would abate. Instead, her temperature spiked. The morning of her rescheduled trip, she woke up clammy and disoriented and completely terrified that if she didn\u2019t hurl her body out to Hollywood that day, then Amy Sherman-Palladino and her co-creator (and husband), Daniel Palladino, were going to give the part of Midge Maisel away to the next woman. And she couldn\u2019t let that happen. So, she said, \u201cI flew my ass out to Los Angeles when I probably should not have even been on a plane.\u201dThe thing was, she had a feeling in her bones that Midge was her part. In a world of hamburger roles for television ing\u00e9nues, Midge was a porterhouse. Amy Sherman-Palladino writes her leading ladies \u2014 Lorelai of \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d Michelle Simms on \u201cBunheads\u201d \u2014 as walking winks, verbose descendants of Dorothy Parker, quipping for their lives. And Brosnahan felt that she could truly inhabit Miriam (Midge) Maisel, a young Jewish housewife in 1958 who has finagled the full megillah straight out of Bryn Mawr \u2014 the gleaming Upper West Side apartment, the doting husband who pitches ad copy by day and wears transgressive turtlenecks by night, a toddler and a bouncing baby and a waist that cinches to a Coke-bottle shape in a Perma-lift girdle. (Never mind that Brosnahan is a gentile.)By the end of the first episode, of course, Midge\u2019s idyll crumbles. It has to \u2014 no one wants to watch a show about a merry midcentury homemaker with zero problems. First, she finds out that her husband, Joel, who spends his nights workshopping comedy sets at the Greenwich Village club the Gaslight Caf\u00e9, has been stealing his material from Bob Newhart records. Emasculated, Joel continues to dig: He reveals to Midge that he\u2019s sleeping with his svelte secretary, Penny Pann, and worse, that they\u2019re in love, and he\u2019s packing his bags. After he slinks away, Midge downs a bottle of red wine on the subway, marches through the rain to the famed Gaslight club and winds up onstage, soaking and soused in a pink swing coat. What follows is not so much a comedy set as an act of absurdist outsider art; Midge mocks men coming out of the bathroom, skulks around the stage like a Valkyrie and veers between pathos and one-liners so wildly that the crowd isn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or flee. For a grand finale, her top comes off, the cops are called and she\u2019s hauled off to jail screaming about how \u201cthere\u2019s no [expletive] way that Penny Pann can compete with these tits!\u201dThis meltdown is one of the scenes that Brosnahan had to play during that audition, while she was dizzy and barely lucid. Her illness, it turns out, worked in her favor. She looked slightly damp and deranged the entire time. \u201cI had to take off my shoes at one point because I was sweating so much,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt was a mess. And Amy kept stopping me to tell me to powder my face. I think I may have had a small stroke? I literally don\u2019t remember a single moment of it.\u201dBrosnahan has been an actress on the cusp for a decade \u2014 always just about to break out, about to be the chosen one. It\u2019s not that she hasn\u2019t been noticed. When she was 21 and about to graduate from N.Y.U., she was cast on Netflix\u2019s first series, \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d as Rachel Posner, a high-end escort in Washington who sleeps with a congressman and then is paid off to stay quiet. The role was originally intended for someone older, and Brosnahan was supposed to act in only two episodes. \u201cThey told me I was too young and that I should wear a tighter dress because they had to believe I was a lot older than I was,\u201d she told me. \u201cI thought, Oh, God, I definitely didn\u2019t get this, and they are going to figure out I\u2019m a fraud.\u201dNot only did she get it, but her chemistry with Michael Kelly, who played the presidential chief of staff assigned to handle Posner and who falls for her in the process, was so undeniable that the creators wrote her character from a five-line role into eight episodes in the second season, and then one more episode, in the third, that earned her an Emmy nomination. \u201cMichael used to call my agent after we had scenes together and tell him how much he enjoyed working with me,\u201d she told me.We were walking underneath a giant aqueduct. Brosnahan is petite and put together; that afternoon, she was wearing a striped T-shirt with a fitted motorcycle jacket and a demure pair of black penny loafers. She looked like a preppy mime. For our first meeting, she wanted to see the medieval art at the Cloisters, a short trip north of her apartment in Manhattan, but we both agreed that the day was too warm to spend among dusty tapestries. Instead, she wanted to stroll along the Hudson through the wildflowers. \u201cI really credit Michael as being a huge reason I continued on that show,\u201d she said. There was a fierceness to Brosnahan in the role; even though she was young, she played a political Fantine who was already weathered and wry, as disgusted by the grubby hands of lobbyists as their detractors on the Hill.Her character met a brutal end \u2014 buried somewhere in the wilderness for knowing too much \u2014 but by then Brosnahan already had another TV job. She played Abby Isaacs, the young wife of a physicist in the underrated period drama \u201cManhattan,\u201d about the creation of the atomic bomb. All red lipstick and pin curls and wifely duties, Abby was a hint at what Brosnahan could do with a part like Midge: another woman who loses her innocence, in this case a newcomer to Los Alamos who must slowly come to understand that her husband might help blow up the world. Lila Byock, one of the show\u2019s writers, told me: \u201cI don\u2019t think Rachel ever gave a bad take. And I\u2019m not being hyperbolic. We would watch takes, and it was like, holy [expletive], who is this person? She was about a year older than the actress who was playing a teenager on our show, but it was almost like she walked in fully formed.\u201dUntil Midge, Brosnahan played almost solely dramatic roles. That\u2019s where she feels most comfortable, most in control; as she has discovered, telling jokes involves a level of vulnerability far beyond crying on camera. Luckily, the women whom Sherman-Palladino and Palladino write are all about taut sentences and tight timing; there is nothing elastic about them. Their loose, swingy tempo is entirely preplanned, down to the word (\u201ca monstrous amount of material, and you have to have it down cold,\u201d Brosnahan said). While this rigor may not have worked for a seasoned comedian, someone accustomed to improvisation, Brosnahan took to the constraints right away. She found the bounce inside Midge\u2019s hardness; she snaps the end of her sentences like bubble gum.Sherman-Palladino\u2019s own father, Don Sherman, was a comic right out of the borscht-belt old school. After he died in 2012, she started to think about how she might honor his legacy by telling stories about his world \u2014 Lenny Bruce would come by the house when she was a child, and though her family lived in L.A. by then, she grew up hearing war stories about the New York stand-up scene. She began to think about setting something in the world her father rattled around in, the dank Village clubs of the \u201960s. But instead of following a grizzled comic through the haze of two-drink minimums and chance encounters with Jack Paar, she decided to showcase a much less examined life: that of a normal woman, alone under the hot lights, slinging zingers for pay.\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d has a swirling, magical-realism quality to it. It begins with a wedding \u2014 Midge and Joel\u2019s \u2014 at which, naturally, Midge insists on giving her own toast. She is a woman who has enjoyed every privilege: couture clothes, the full spread at Zabar\u2019s fish counter, a palatial apartment in her parents\u2019 building. One striking scene from the pilot follows Midge as she does her nightly beauty routine, waking up twice in the middle of the night, once to remove her makeup and again to put it back on, so that her husband always wakes up to a perfectly done face. When Joel leaves Midge, the shock is seismic. She has never had to work, or even struggle with her own self-image. This is why her revelations are so primed for comedy: She is a woman who fully believed she deserved the moon, and when her perfect facade disappears, she\u2019s apoplectic and confused and ready to rant.Whenever Midge\u2019s jokes really hit, it is joyful and electric to watch. Women have the right to claim, and reclaim, a place in stand-up comedy history. There were always women working the circuit, even on the borscht belt \u2014 like the 1960s club regular Belle Barth, who sold millions of comedy records. \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d provides a vehicle through which to engage and recover their stories all over again. Because Midge doesn\u2019t start out on a crusade, she almost smuggles progress into the world; like many women navigating midcentury lives, her success is mounted like an undercover operation.The \u201cMaisel\u201d set sits on a cavernous soundstage at Steiner Studios, in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Because Amazon ordered two seasons (the streaming service\u2019s first immediate renewal, based on the strength of the pilot alone), the production designer Bill Groom\u2019s intricate replicas of 1950s New York will stay in place until next spring, when \u201cMaisel\u201d goes back into production. Sherman-Palladino and Palladino wanted to shoot on location as much as possible, but so little of the midcentury metropolis remains intact. The crew hung a scrim the length of a city block painted with apartment buildings at night, each glowing window illuminating a different urban tableau. There is one closed corner of the set, strictly off-limits to outsiders: the box that houses the Gaslight Caf\u00e9. The creators don\u2019t want strangers to watch while Brosnahan is doing stand-up. The only people allowed in are the extras in beatnik dress and a handful of crew members. In early episodes, for sound-editing purposes, she had to deliver her act to a silent crowd.I watched Brosnahan film a domestic scene from the seventh episode, in which she and her pert platinum friend, Imogene, played by Bailey De Young, are stuffing goody bags for a children\u2019s birthday party inside her parents\u2019 posh apartment. The scene was simple enough: Sort toys into bags while gossiping about Midge and Joel\u2019s separation. But the number of props was overwhelming. There were dozens of period-appropriate trinkets \u2014 Tiny Tina baby carriages, Silly Putty, Bazooka Joe \u2014 and the women had to place them into each bag in a precise order, all while firing off rapid, breathless dialogue. It was the final shot of the night, and Brosnahan had already been cinched into a corset for six hours. Her brain was mush, she told me, \u201cbecause we\u2019d already shot 40 pages of dialogue that week,\u201d but she attacked the scene with laser intensity as the two began shuffling knickknacks around.\u201cWait, there\u2019s already gum in here,\u201d Brosnahan, as Midge, said, her forehead crinkling.\u201cI put it in there,\u201d De Young said, playing Imogene slightly ditsy.\u201cI\u2019m doing gum.\u201d\u201cI thought you were doing candy cigarettes.\u201d\u201cStarting over,\u201d Brosnahan sighs, dumping out the gift bags with a loud clatter onto the table.With each take, the two sped up the lines, hands flying. Speak, sigh, pour, speak, sigh, pour, faster and faster. Brosnahan pounced on her lines like a whizzing metronome. Midge is the kind of woman who sets a blistering tempo and waits for the rest of the world to catch up.Rachel Syme is a writer and cultural critic based in New York City.

{"Headline": "If No One Owns the Moon, Can Anyone Make Money Up There?", "Date": "2017-11-26", "News": "Ambiguities in the 50-year-old Outer Space Treaty may be getting in the way of entrepreneurs seeking opportunities elsewhere in our solar system.Supported byMoon Express would not need all of these facilities if its only goal were to win the Lunar X Prize.Its second spacecraft aims to land in 2019 near the moon\u2019s south pole. A third, larger spacecraft in 2020 is to gather samples and then bring them back to Earth, the first haul of moon rocks since a Soviet robotic probe\u2019s return in 1976.But these plans almost came to a halt a couple of years ago \u2014 not because of technological challenges or financial shortfalls, but because of an international agreement known as the Outer Space Treaty, which is marking its 50th anniversary this year.The treaty spells out what countries are and are not allowed to do in space. Its crowning achievement was stopping the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union from expanding into space.But the agreement may now be getting in the way of entrepreneurs with plans to push farther and faster into space than national agencies like NASA.\u201cBefore it was something really, really hypothetical,\u201d said Fabio Tronchetti, a law professor at Harbin Institute of Technology in China. \u201cBut now there are groups that are really serious. It changes everything.\u201dRobert D. Richards, Moon Express\u2019s chief executive \u2014 whose business plan is \u201cto expand Earth\u2019s economic sphere to the moon and beyond\u201d \u2014 is far from the only entrepreneur looking for business opportunities beyond our planet.As these companies go where no businesses have gone before, they raise questions only fuzzily addressed by the Outer Space Treaty: What are private companies allowed to do in space? Can a company mine the moon or an asteroid and then sell what it has pulled out? How are countries to regulate these businesses?Internationally, countries have been discussing how to answer these questions. In the United States, Congress has begun tackling regulatory issues. Some warn that if the United States does not set up business-friendly policies, then the start-ups could move elsewhere \u2014 including such seemingly unlikely places as Luxembourg.The treaty also prohibited nations from making any claim of sovereignty over any part of the rest of the solar system.Moon Express ran into a bureaucratic wall because the treaty declares that activities of nongovernmental entities \u2014 a classification that includes commercial companies \u2014 \u201crequire authorization and continuing supervision\u201d of the government. (The United States had insisted on the clause, rejecting the Soviet view that space exploration should be limited to governments.)The Federal Aviation Administration licenses rocket launches and re-entry of commercial spacecraft from orbit in order to ensure the safety of people on the ground. The Federal Communications Commission regulates communications satellites, and the Department of Commerce regulates commercial remote sensing satellites.But the United States does not as yet have a process for authorizing or supervising novel endeavors like a private company landing on the moon.In announcing the decision, however, the F.A.A. said the approval applied only to this one Moon Express launch, and that not even Moon Express could count on a favorable outcome in the future.Moon Express has begun discussions with the F.A.A. for the second trip to the lunar south pole, and Dr. Richards is confident that the company could successfully pull off its first three flights via the current regulatory patchwork.But if Congress and the president do not come up with a better solution, Moon Express, SpaceX, Blue Origin and the rest of the emerging industry could run into more bureaucratic walls, and companies might start looking for other places to set up shop.Dr. Richards said he remained optimistic.\u201cEach company is moving forward with some assumption of risk but a presumption of the U.S. government coming through with frameworks that allow that to happen,\u201d Dr. Richards said in October during a visit at his company\u2019s Florida headquarters.Planetary Resources\u2019s goal is to mine the solar system\u2019s asteroids. Luxembourg, a nation smaller than Rhode Island with a long history in mining, has bet 200 million euros \u2014 more than $225 million \u2014 on this industry that does not exist. That includes $28 million invested in Planetary Resources. In return, Luxembourg owns a 10 percent share of the company, said Etienne Schneider, the country\u2019s deputy prime minister.Back in April, Luxembourg\u2019s crown prince, his wife and government officials paid a visit to Planetary Resources, putting on white gowns, gloves, wispy caps and baby blue bootees \u2014 a distinctly unroyal outfit sometimes called a \u201cbunny suit\u201d \u2014 to take a close look at where the company is assembling small satellites.In June, Mr. Schneider returned to the United States to host a symposium with a roomful of bankers and venture capitalists, a vivid demonstration that private space investment has reached a tipping point of credibility.A Goldman Sachs report about innovative space businesses that came out in the spring seemed to agree. \u201cSpace mining could be more realistic than perceived,\u201d the report said. \u201cWhile the psychological barrier to mining asteroids is high, the actual financial and technological barriers are far lower.\u201dAt the Manhattan presentation, Mr. Schneider readily acknowledged that the notion of asteroid mining sounds like science fiction and that he often gets quizzical questions about why Luxembourg is spending money chasing this.Mr. Schneider recalled that during a visit to Silicon Valley in 2012, he met S. Pete Worden, then the director of the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., who suggested that Luxembourg look into asteroid mining.\u201cAt the time, I listened to him and wondered what this guy might have smoked,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.But more discussions and research convinced Mr. Schneider this was a promising possibility.For Planetary Resources, the first wave of development is to culminate in a doughnut-shape spacecraft heading on a prospecting mission to a near-Earth asteroid in 2020.Sometime after that, the company hopes to mine in earnest \u2014 for seemingly mundane water ice. But water, in addition to potentially providing something to drink for astronauts, can be split into hydrogen and oxygen. Both can be used as rocket propellent; the oxygen, of course, also can provide air to breathe.As a business, Planetary Resources is betting that by the time it extracts water from an asteroid, there will be a customer like NASA interested in buying water, hydrogen and oxygen.Eventually, the company aims to extract platinum, currently worth more than $900 an ounce, and other precious metals.To make these pursuits easier, Luxembourg passed a space law that took effect this summer. Planetary Resources has set up its European office there. Moves like this one are in part motivating policymakers in the United States to devote more attention to American laws that currently govern commercial space activities.Ambiguities in the Outer Space Treaty currently create uncertainty over whether anyone can profit from such business ventures. Article II in particular states, \u201cOuter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.\u201dThis year, Congress is revisiting the Outer Space Treaty again, hoping to boost nascent space companies looking to push outward into the solar system.It would put the regulatory power in an Office of Space Commerce, which would have 60 days to decide whether to approve or deny a company\u2019s application. The full House has not yet taken up the bill, and the Senate is still working on its version.Officials at Moon Express and Planetary Resources say they do not want unfettered freedom in space, nor do they seek withdrawal from the Outer Space Treaty.\u201cOur goal is to have a space environment that is populated by people acting responsibly,\u201d said Peter Marquez, vice president for global engagement at Planetary Resources. \u201cIf there aren\u2019t any adults in the room, it concerns me. If it turns into the wild, wild West of just do whatever you want, then that kind of runs against concepts and precepts of Outer Space Treaty.\u201dThese companies do want the regulations to be \u201clight-touch\u201d and hope that the default inclination of the U.S. government will be to say yes.Once the price of transportation comes down, more business opportunities will open up, Dr. Richards said.The moon, peppered with the impacts of asteroids over the eons, should also possess dollops of platinum and other precious metals. Helium-3, embedded in the lunar crust by the solar wind, could be fuel for future fusion power plants.Moon Express\u2019s family of spacecraft could be a boon to scientists, sending low-cost probes not just to the moon but to other planets.Patches of eternal sunshine on the moon could be limited, valuable resources that nations and companies will someday squabble over.Dr. Richards compared this moment he sees coming to the 19th century California Gold Rush, when gold diggers jousted over the most lucrative places to sift ore. But he was confident that the new competitors would reach compromises.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be bad players per se, but there could be arguments over areas of operation overlap,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those are problems for the future, and that\u2019ll be a great problem to have.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the last time a spacecraft brought moon rocks back to Earth. It was a Soviet probe in 1976, not the last of NASA\u2019s Apollo missions. Additionally a picture used in an earlier version of this article misidentified the location of a visit by the Hereditary Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg. It was from their visit of SSL in California, not an earlier stop at Planetary Resources in Washington State.Advertisement"}

Available for purchase there is a wide variety of knockoff Nets merchandise, from jerseys to caps to T-shirts.The company said on Thursday that profit for its most recent quarter more than doubled compared with the same period a year ago, thanks in part to a 61 percent rise in revenue. By comparison, Amazon reported a 34 percent revenue increase for the same quarter.Still, the results released Thursday show that Alibaba still has ground to cover as it seeks to grow beyond e-commerce into more of a data and technology company. Apart from online shopping, its other businesses lost money.Alibaba\u2019s core business continues to be a money-spinner. That business generated nearly $3.6 billion in income during the quarter, about 50 percent more than a year ago. The company says nearly half a billion people now shop on its platforms annually.Alibaba has ranged far afield of e-commerce in recent years. It owns a movie studio, a soccer club and a Hong Kong newspaper, plus stakes in a variety of tech start-ups. The company is also spending $15 billion over the next several years on research in artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge fields.In the near term, though, investors are more interested in Alibaba\u2019s recently announced investment of the same amount in logistics. Alibaba has long depended on outside companies to deliver packages. But Jack Ma, the company\u2019s founder and executive chairman, has said his goal is to ship anywhere in China within 24 hours, and anywhere in the world within 72. That will require a lot of spending.Alibaba has found ways to make more money from its shopping platforms.

Occasionally he raised his phone to take a photo or record video of the scene where the deadly Tubbs fire had burned.On the morning of Oct. 9, he woke up early to the smell of smoke, looked outside, saw flames advancing toward his street and knew he had to get his wife and four children out. Quickly, they evacuated.Now, the cleanup of the fire has begun. Crews wearing full face masks and white protective suits have started peeling away the debris left by the blaze which destroyed most of the homes in the tidy urban area, where some streets bear coffee-themed names.Excavator buckets can be seen in multiple locations scooping the ash, shells of appliances and other twisted metal into waiting dump trucks. Small items like pieces of pottery or parts of a Nativity scene left behind on a retaining wall are sometimes all that\u2019s left.With the rainy season beginning, the crews are careful not to let the material wash into storm drains \u2014 they\u2019re also careful to protect themselves from anything harmful that may be in the ash.

{"Headline": "Scenes From Sears: 2 Locations Tell a Story of Struggle in a Tight Retail Market", "Date": "2017-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHILLIPSBURG, N.J. \u2014 Every year on Black Friday, Angela Buzatto has come to Sears to buy two new vacuum cleaners, at steep discounts, for her house cleaning business. This year she was going to buy four of them.Ms. Buzatto couldn\u2019t resist. The Sears in the Phillipsburg Mall is closing its doors for good and everything has to go. Along with vacuums on sale at even bigger discounts, she bought her 8-year-old daughter a shimmering white dress for $24 and a $10 pair of fuzzy blue shoes.Black Friday is the most celebrated shopping day of the year, when parking lots fill up early with bargain hunters and online frenzy crashes the websites of even the most established retailers. In Los Angeles, a line formed overnight at a sneaker boutique on Melrose Avenue, and a throng of shoppers stood behind fences in the early morning darkness waiting to get into the Mall of America near Minneapolis.But for Ms. Buzatto, standing in a dim hallway in the Phillipsburg Mall, it was a different scene. Next to Sears were rows of empty storefronts for retailers like Payless Shoes and Radio Shack, both of which have gone through bankruptcy.The bleak scene was emblematic of the difficult challenges confronting many brick and mortar retailers, which are struggling to figure out how to survive Amazon\u2019s seemingly unstoppable march to dominate the American wallet.Analysts say retailers are expected to close more stores this year than at any time since the 2008 recession. The pressure from e-commerce, coupled with many retailers loading up on debt during better days, has led to a string of bankruptcies this year. Thousands of retail workers have lost their jobs. Overall employment in the retail industry has been declining since July \u2014 which economists say is highly unusual given that the economy is relatively strong.All the ingredients are in place for a strong shopping season \u2014 low unemployment, a soaring stock market, and high consumer confidence. Holiday sales are projected to increase by as much as 4 percent from a year ago, to $682 billion, according to the National Retail Federation.And yet these positive conditions come at a vulnerable time for many retailers, as they try to adjust their business model from a legacy of operating hundreds of stores in suburban malls to a more adept online operation.Sears is determined to survive the turmoil, despite falling sales and a stock price that now trades for less than $4.Even as Sears is closing stores, the company is opening some new ones and renovating others to make them smaller and more attractive. The company has a deal with Uber in which drivers receive significant discounts at Sears.One of the company\u2019s remodeled stores, in Wayne, N.J., was bustling on Friday morning. An employee in a red vest greeted shoppers at the door, handing out a circular showcasing the biggest deals. By noon, the checkout line was wrapped around racks of one-piece fleece pajamas and winter coats.As it works on a turnaround, Sears is paying down its debt, cutting costs and integrating its online and bricks and mortar operations to give customers more choices in how they shop.\u201cWe are fighting like hell,\u201d the Sears chairman, Edward Lampert, said in a statement earlier this year.One cost-cutting measure is closing stores. Sears announced earlier this month that it was closing the Phillipsburg store. When that store opened at 7 a.m. for its last Black Friday, the parking lot out front was empty \u2014 except for a minivan and a white pickup truck.A man in a hooded sweatshirt stood next to the truck, then hurried inside.Red and yellow banners reading \u201cStore Closing Sale\u201d and \u201cNothing Held Back\u201d hung from the ceiling.Throughout the store, tables of shirts, pants and sweaters were neatly arranged and most of them fully stocked. A display of patriotic-themed shirts featuring wolves and eagles were selling for 40 percent off. Snowmen scarves, originally $5.99, were selling for about $3.The scarves caught the eye of Elaine Freeman, who was browsing for Christmas gifts with her sister Faith, while their car was being serviced at the Sears automotive center.The sisters grew up coming to the Sears with their parents, and they wanted to show their loyalty by shopping there one last Black Friday.Ms. Freeman, who works at a medical billing firm, said she has always been able to buy things at Sears that she cannot find at other large retailers. Just this week, she said, her niece needed a roasting pan large enough for the turkey she was planning to cook for Thanksgiving.\u201cIt\u2019s Black Friday, people are shopping elsewhere, but we are choosing to be here,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Freeman said.At around 7:45 a.m., Tyler Kwiecinski, 21, and Zoe Vallese, 19, wandered into the store and headed toward the appliance section. For decades, Sears has built a loyal customer base attracted to its Kenmore brands of stoves, microwaves and air-conditioners.But these young friends had never been inside a Sears \u2014 at least not that they could remember. They had gotten up early that morning to hit GameStop, a video game store at the other end of the mall, and were curious when they saw the big yellow \u201cStore Closing\u2019\u2019 sign outside Sears.\u201cMy dad explained to me that Sears was like Walmart before Walmart arrived,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Kwiecinski, who left without buying anything.Not far from the appliances was a stand of artificial Christmas trees of different varieties like the \u201cWestchester Slim Cashmere Pine.\u201d One of the trees was spinning, as its white lights blinked. They were all on sale for 30 percent off.Nancy Hartman and her daughter Jennifer Verdicchio have shopped at Sears on Black Friday for as long as they can remember. On Friday, Ms. Hartman peered into one of the empty, darkened storefronts next to the Sears.\u201cI took my grandson to this mall recently and he asked me \u2018Nana, why are the stores closing?\u2019\u201d Ms. Hartman said. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing.\u201dAbout 65 miles away from the Phillipsburg Mall, the Sears in Wayne was in a different world. The store has new merchandising displays, checkout counters and sleek lighting. The building exterior has fresh white and blue signage.Victoria Setzer shopped for boys\u2019 clothing in the Wayne store on Friday around noon. Her parents met at a Sears in the 1960s, while her mother was working for the catalog.\u201cThere is so much history and tradition, it\u2019s a piece of Americana,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Setzer said.But her loyalty to Sears has been tested after her recently purchased Kenmore refrigerator needed repairs twice.\u201cI hope it survives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if they can.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect name for a video game store at the Phillipsburg Mall in New Jersey. It is GameStop, not Game Stopper.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T Has No Intention of Selling CNN to Finalize Deal", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRandall L. Stephenson, chief executive of telecommunications giant AT&T, said selling CNN in order to push through his company\u2019s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner has never been and will never be on the table.\u201cI have never offered to sell CNN,\u201d he said repeatedly. \u201cThere is absolutely no intention that we would ever sell CNN.\u201dMr. Stephenson said Thursday that the Justice Department had never told AT&T that selling CNN was the price of getting the deal done.Since the election, Mr. Stephenson has met with Mr. Trump several times. But he said he has not, to the best of his recollection, had conversations with people inside the administration about the deal.To a question \u2014 posed by a CNN reporter in the crowd \u2014 about whether the pall over the deal can be attributed in part to a \u201cTrump factor,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said no.If completed, the acquisition of Time Warner \u2014 the owner of HBO, Warner Bros. and CNN \u2014 would transform AT&T into a colossus capable of both producing content and distributing it to millions of people via its wireless and satellite services.But on Wednesday, negotiations between the companies and the Justice Department appeared to be mired in politics.Accounts of AT&T\u2019s meeting with antitrust officials on Monday \u2014 which Mr. Stephenson said was \u201cvery productive\u201d \u2014 have differed. In one, Justice Department officials called on the company to sell Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN, or DirecTV \u2014 the satellite television provider that AT&T purchased two years ago for nearly $49 billion \u2014 for the Time Warner deal to proceed.Another version involved Mr. Stephenson\u2019s offering to sell the news channel. Mr. Stephenson on Wednesday and again on Thursday denied making such an overture.\u201cThis is a classic vertical merger,\u201d Mr. Stephenson told The Times\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin. \u201cThere are no overlaps of competition. There are no competitors being taken out of the competition. There hasn\u2019t been one of these challenged in the courts and defeated in 40 years.\u201dThe deal is designed to help AT&T counter slowing growth in its core wireless, internet and satellite businesses while fending off online video upstarts like Netflix and Hulu.\u201cThe idea that somehow we\u2019re going to take distribution and content and create something so powerful that it would disrupt Google, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix, it\u2019s comical to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying build a platform that allows us to compete with those guys.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the AT&T-Time Warner Merger Makes Sense", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCombining AT&T, which distributes digital content over its wireless networks, with a news and entertainment provider like Time Warner is what economists and antitrust experts consider a classic vertical merger. Because the companies don\u2019t compete, their combining would not alter the competitive landscape in either the telecommunications or entertainment industries.For more than 40 years, through Republican and Democratic administrations, the courts have not blocked a vertical integration like this one.Typically more problematic for the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division are horizontal mergers, where two competitors in the same industry seek to combine. But this past summer the Trump administration waved through the horizontal merger of the giant retailer Amazon, already active in food sales, with a leading upscale grocer, Whole Foods. To now block a vertical integration of AT&T and Time Warner would indicate an inexcusably scattershot approach to antitrust decisions that would create enormous uncertainties for the broader business community and shake public confidence in the rule of law that underpins our democracy.Businesses seek to integrate vertically because such mergers tend to create efficiencies and synergies \u2014 benefiting both companies without posing major risks to their competitors or, more crucially, to consumers. With all the options available to consumers for receiving video programming these days \u2014 including cable, satellite, internet broadband and smartphones \u2014 the market is vibrantly, almost chaotically, competitive and innovative. When viewed in light of this creative turmoil, the AT&T-Time Warner transaction does not pose a competitive threat. If anything, it would create an attractive set of new options for the viewing public.To appreciate the dynamism of the video and television space, consider that Apple, a relatively new entrant, recently ordered two full seasons of Reese Witherspoon\u2019s latest television show without so much as seeing a pilot. It underscored the competitive new dynamics of the marketplace: Companies are throwing around cash like never before to attract viewers already happily distracted by an array of programming and viewing alternatives in this new golden age of television.Rather than Time Warner holding anything resembling a dominant position in the entertainment industry, it finds itself competing with emerging video powerhouses like Netflix and Amazon. And consumers are increasingly cutting the cable because they have numerous, often cheaper streaming options for getting content they want.How do we know? One need only look at perhaps the closest comparison to the AT&T-Time Warner merger \u2014 the marriage of the nation\u2019s largest cable and internet broadband provider, Comcast, to NBC Universal, which the Justice Department blessed in 2011. Despite the arguments of opponents at the time, there has been no negative impact to consumers or competitors. Quite the opposite \u2014 the competitive and creative forces that continue to change the industry have only accelerated since the Comcast-NBC merger.If the Justice Department cannot cite persuasive antitrust grounds for blocking the AT&T-Time Warner merger, the public will be left wondering whether political motives were involved or that the department\u2019s thinking was muddied by vague opposition to media consolidation. Neither of those reasons would likely stand up in federal court.By any objective analysis, the real power in the information industry these days is not in the wireless or entertainment industries. It is in companies like Google and Facebook, which possess the power to influence our national elections and redefine basic human interactions. In this brave new digital world, blocking the merger of AT&T and Time Warner would only undermine public confidence in the ability of antitrust enforcers to recognize reality.Instead, the Justice Department should approve the merger and get to work policing the real threats to competition and consumer welfare.Michael J.

{"Headline": "Soothsayer in the Hills Sees Silicon Valley\u2019s Sinister Side", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith ... Jaron LanierBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 Jaron Lanier is the most unusual person I\u2019ve ever met.And I\u2019ve met a lot of unusual people.\u201cI\u2019m a professional illusionist,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways, I might know more about making illusions than anybody.\u201dMr. Lanier is one of the few prophets who admits that the spawn of Silicon Valley could become evil, but he tries to stay on the sunny side. It helps that he avoids all social media.\u201cThe popular ones are designed for behavior modification,\u201d he says, wearing his usual black T-shirt and black pants. \u201cIt\u2019s like, why would you go sign up for an evil hypnotist who\u2019s explicitly saying that his whole purpose is to get you to do things that people have paid him to get you to do, but he won\u2019t tell you who they are?\u201dAt this moment when dark clouds loom over Silicon Valley, Mr. Lanier is able to talk about the Lords of the Cloud with affection yet candor, as he worries that these tech gods creating new worlds may be getting \u201chigh on their own supply.\u201d\u201cThis is such a scary time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says, in his sweet, breathy voice. \u201cI mean, it is for me. I had always feared we would create this social-manipulation technology out of computers.\u201dIn his forthcoming memoir, \u201cDawn of the New Everything: Encounters With Reality and Virtual Reality,\u201d the Microsoft wizard enthuses that VR \u201cweds the nerdy thing with the hippie mystic thing,\u201d high-tech but like a dream and \u201can elixir of unbounded experience.\u201dBut he\u2019s well aware of the \u201cMatrix\u201d dangers. He realized early on, he writes, that \u201cit could turn out to be the evilest invention of all time.\u201dIt\u2019s a pretty simple proposition, he tells me: \u201cIf you control the person\u2019s reality, you control the person.\u201d Or as he writes in the book, \u201cNever has a medium been so potent for beauty and so vulnerable to creepiness.\u201dRecently, the creepiness has been on display.Mark Zuckerberg stumbled into more trouble for tone-deafness when he used his cartoon avatar to take a disaster adventure trip, a \u201cmagical\u201d 360-degree virtual reality tour of hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico to promote his new Facebook Spaces app.\u201cOh, God,\u201d Mr. Lanier said when he saw it. \u201cIt is scary and awful how out of touch Silicon Valley people have become.\u201dThe story also noted that, given how lifelike the technology is, \u201ccertainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual reality sex constitutes cheating.\u201dMr. Lanier, who discourses eloquently on subjects like limerence and lust in his book, says: \u201cThe future I\u2019d prefer to see is one where people use VR together to make really crazy imaginative experiences that might be sexual or might not. Where you turn into fantastical creatures and that sort of thing. Or when your bodies merge in some ways. That to me is so much more interesting than the porn. Porn is a product of the cinema era. It\u2019s an old-fashioned way of thinking, locked in the 19th century.\u201dMore and more, we are wondering why, when we know the top Silicon Valley companies are not benevolent, we invite them into the most intimate areas of our lives, as Scott Galloway asks in \u201cThe Four,\u201d a book about how Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are refashioning the world. \u201cAre these entities the Four Horsemen of god, love, sex, and consumption?\u201d Mr. Galloway wonders. \u201cOr are they the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse?\u201dEven though he\u2019s prone to whimsical, esoteric tangents, I know I can get a straight answer on that from Mr. Lanier.We sit down at his dining room table amid a wild cornucopia of stuff, including a lamp with a hot pink feathered shade and black cats lounging on chairs and hanging, Cirque du Soleil-style, from carpeted staircases. There are also musical instruments \u2014 a golden Wurlitzer pedal harp; a rare pre-Depression Mason & Hamlin piano that Mr. Lanier says has \u201ca uniquely American sound,\u201d a 19th-century Chinese opium bed filled with saxophones, flutes, clarinets, lutes and ouds; mandolins covering the walls, and over a thousand more instruments, from a medieval cornetto to a shakuhachi, a Japanese flute \u2014 all of which Mr. Lanier can play.Like his house, his new book is crammed full of strange and mesmerizing stuff.Right after he was born, his mother, a Marlene Dietrich look-alike and Viennese pianist and stock trader who had talked her way out of a concentration camp by passing as Aryan, and his father, whose family had been mostly wiped out in Ukrainian pogroms, took Jaron someplace they thought would be safe: the westernmost corner of Texas. There, he had to confront more than his share of bullies growing up, once by swinging a baritone horn at them.His mother died when he was about 9, when her car flipped over on the freeway as she was coming back from getting her driver\u2019s license. His father, who worked for a time as the science editor of \u201cAmazing,\u201d \u201cFantastic\u201d and \u201cAstounding\u201d pulp science-fiction magazines, then let his 11-year-old son design their new house in New Mexico: a geodesic dome.The design, Mr. Lanier writes, looked \u201ca little like a woman\u2019s body. You could see the big dome as a pregnant belly and the two icosahedrons as breasts.\u201dHe tosses out that his father may have been the one to start the rumor about alligators in the sewers of New York.After a takeout chicken and macaroni dinner, Mr. Lanier bids a loving good night to his wife, Lena, a child psychologist, and their 11-year old daughter, Lilibell. Then he brings out his Microsoft HoloLens headsets and a big mug of chocolate milk. \u201cI\u2019m more like the child than the parent, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he says.I spend some time wearing the headset painting graffiti in the air with my hand, and Mr. Lanier explains why the brain can see more than the eyes.\u201cExpect some smelly feet,\u201d Mr. Lanier says.Unlike many here, he does not think of humans as ants in his experiments.\u201cHopefully, in this period, when we\u2019re dealing with this really crude and early stuff like Facebook feeds, Instagram, Snapchat,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019ll be able to get the politics straight and find a path for people to have dignity and autonomy before the hard-core stuff comes. Unless we all kill ourselves through this other stuff, which is a possibility, too. One of the great joys of the Trump era is having your 11-year-old say, \u2018The former head of NATO said there\u2019s a one in 10 chance of nuclear war. Is that right?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, great. Thank you, Trump. That\u2019s very nice.\u2019\u201dMr. Lanier believes that Facebook and Google, with their \u201ctop-down control schemes,\u201d should be called \u201cBehavior Modification Empires.\u201d\u201cThe whole internet thing was supposed to create the world\u2019s best information resource in all of history,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything would be made visible. And instead we\u2019re living in this time of total opacity where you don\u2019t know why you see the news you see. You don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same news that someone else sees. You don\u2019t know who made it be that way. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s paid to change what you see. Everything is totally obscure in a profound way that it never was before.\u201cAnd the belief system of Silicon Valley is so thick that my friends at Facebook simply still really believe that the answer to any problem is to do more of what they already did, that they\u2019re optimizing the world.\u201cThe Facebook business model is mass behavior modification for pay. And for those who are not giving Facebook money, the only \u2014 and I want to emphasize, the only, underlined and in bold and italics \u2014 reward they can get or positive feedback is just getting attention. And if you have a system where the only possible prize is getting more attention, then you call that system Christmas for Asses, right? It\u2019s a creep-amplification device.\u201cOnce Facebook becomes ubiquitous, it\u2019s a sort of giant protection racket, where, if you don\u2019t pay them money, then someone else will pay to modify the behavior to your disadvantage, so everyone has to pay money just to stay at equilibrium where they would have been otherwise,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s only one way out for Facebook, which is to change its business model. Unless Facebook changes, we\u2019ll just have to trust Facebook for any future election result. Because they do apparently have the ability to change them. Or at least change the close ones.\u201dWhy would Facebook change its business model when it\u2019s raking in billions?\u201cI would appeal to the decency of the people in it,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd if not to them, then the toughness of the regulators. It\u2019s going to be one of the struggles of the century.\u201dI point out that after the stunning Trump win, President Obama took Mr. Zuckerberg aside and warned him to take the threat of political disinformation seriously, but the young billionaire dismissed the idea that it was widespread.\u201cWell, no one in Silicon Valley believes that anybody knows more than us,\u201d Mr. Lanier says dryly. \u201cSurely not the government.\u201dHe continues: \u201cI think there are a lot of good people at Facebook, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re evil as individuals. Or at least not the ones that I\u2019ve met. And I know Google a lot better, and I feel pretty certain that they\u2019re not evil. But both of these companies have this behavior-manipulation business plan, which is just not something the world can sustain at that scale. It just makes everything crazy.\u201dI remark that Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg expressed surprise that their fiendish little invention could do something so nefarious.\u201cPeople in the community knew,\u201d Mr. Lanier says, adding that he wrote essays and participated in debates in the early 1990s about how easy it would be the create unreality and manipulate society, how you could put out a feed of information that would put people in illusory worlds where they thought they had sought out the information but actually they had been guided \u201cthe way a magician forces a card.\u201d\u201cSo for somebody to say they didn\u2019t know the algorithms could do that,\u201d Mr. Lanier says in a disbelieving tone. \u201cIf somebody didn\u2019t know, they should\u2019ve known.\u201dSo what happens when fake news marries virtual reality?\u201cIt could be much more significant,\u201d Mr. Lanier says. \u201cWhen you look at all the ways of manipulating people that you can do with just a crude thing like a Facebook feed \u2014 when people are just looking at images and text on their phones and they\u2019re not really inside synthetic worlds yet \u2014 when you can do it with virtual reality, it\u2019s like total control of the person. So what I\u2019m hoping is that we\u2019re going to figure this stuff out so we don\u2019t make ourselves insane before virtual reality becomes mature.\u201dHe says that Silicon Valley has turned out both better and worse than he expected: \u201cAs far as the worse part, creating a global behavior-modification empire is worse than I thought. And creating a world that\u2019s more opaque instead of less opaque is worse than I thought we should do. It\u2019s also a physically uglier place than I thought it would be. It\u2019s really a shame. If we\u2019re the new Renaissance, why don\u2019t we make this amazing Tuscany here? We have these gorgeous orchards. Why don\u2019t we do something beautiful here instead of just filling it up with parking lots and horrible buildings?\u201dHe says sometimes his peers in the Valley seem perfectly nice but then they will say something \u201cI just can\u2019t believe.\u201d He cites Eric Schmidt\u2019s comment on privacy on CNBC\u2019s \u201cInside the Mind of Google\u201d special in 2009, that \u201cIf you have something that you don\u2019t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Mr. Lanier asks. \u201cIt does give me this feeling sometimes that something\u2019s going wrong with our culture in Silicon Valley and maybe it\u2019s just that thing of power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely, just losing perspective. Like Zuckerberg might think, \u2018Well, I went around to a bunch of states and I ate barbecue and wrestled cattle so I\u2019ve been around all kinds of people.\u2019 But to have people who you respect and listen to have fundamentally different worldviews and question your core logic and think that you may be way off track, that\u2019s a much harder thing to do. And there are people who can be very powerful and comfortable with that. I\u2019ll mention one, whose name is Barack Obama.\u201dI ask Mr. Lanier about the sexual harassment and gender inequity problems roiling the Valley.\u201cWell, sometimes, I think there\u2019s a kind of emerging new male jerk persona of the digital age, which would be some kind of a cross between the Uber guy and the pharma bro and maybe Milo Yiannopoulos and maybe Palmer Luckey and maybe Steve Bannon,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause, there\u2019s this sort of smug, superior, \u2018I\u2019ve got the levers of power, and I know better than you.\u2019 It\u2019s sort of this weird combination of a lot of power and a lot of insecurity at the same time.\u201d He believes that Gamergate led to the alt right. \u201cIt was one of the feeders,\u201d he says.He talks about another personality that is emerging from the digital age.\u201cIf you\u2019re a mark of social media, if you\u2019re being manipulated by it, one of the ways to tell is if there\u2019s a certain kind of personality quality that overtakes you,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been called the snowflake quality. People criticize liberal college kids who have it, but it\u2019s exactly the same thing you see in Trump. It\u2019s this kind of highly reactive, thin-skinned, outraged single-mindedness. I think one way to think of Trump, even though he is a con man and he is an actor and he\u2019s a master manipulator and all that, in a sense he\u2019s also a victim. I\u2019ve met him a few times over 30 years. And what I think I see is someone who has moved from kind of a New York character who was in on his own joke to somebody who is completely freaked out and outraged and feeling like he is on the verge of a catastrophe every second. And so my theory about that is that he was ruined by social media.\u201dMr. Lanier plays me a song he composed to cheer up his wife when she was going through cancer treatments, a Cuban-style charanga flute solo played on a Japanese shakuhachi \u2014 \u201cwhich is a crazy-hard thing to do and I pulled it off.\u201dThen he confides his fear that one of his older cats, Loof, would have been a Trump supporter.\u201cLoof is the sweetest cat in the world but she\u2019s really an anti-immigrant voter,\u201d he says. \u201cShe did not like the idea of young cats coming here. She really didn\u2019t want the change. She really felt like they ruined everything. And I must point out that the new kittens who came are black kittens. They appear to be Bombay cats. Loof is not in a basket of deplorables. She\u2019s just in a basket of blankets.\u201dAs I get ready to leave, the grand illusionist offers an intriguing theory about why the internet is more obsessed with cats than dogs.\u201cI think we know that Facebook is turning us into trained dogs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know we\u2019re being trained. We can feel ourselves being turned into trained circus animals. And we long for that independence that cats show. So when you look at a cat video, what you\u2019re really seeing is this receding identity that you want to cling to and find again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

From the very first arcade game \u2014 Bertie the Brain, the  tick-tack-toe program invented by Josef Kates \u2014 in 1950, to the Ataris of the 1970s and \u201980s, to the Sega Saturns of the 1990s, to the PlayStations of the 2000s, to the introduction of 3-D and virtual reality options in recent years, our appetite for new, immersive worlds in which to play has only grown.There are many reasons for King of Glory\u2019s success: an easily understandable premise, lush graphics paired with exciting special effects and a highly engaged and supportive gaming community. But the game experience is only as good as the smartphone on which it is played; jerky transitions, poor loading speed or inferior graphics can turn off the user. On the flipside, a powerful machine \u2014 such as the smartphones produced by Shenzhen-based OnePlus, a company focusing on creating Android flagship models \u2014 can propel a player up the ranks. \n\u201cAlthough the competition was fierce, the existing Android handsets suffered from obvious imperfections,\u201d says Lau. \u201cI thought, why not create the \u2018perfect\u2019 Android handset?\u201d The original aim was simple: with the customer at the center of the company\u2019s focus, OnePlus was going to build an intuitive, ergonomic device that delivered superb performance at an affordable price. \u201cA good product speaks for itself. The ethos at OnePlus was, and still is, \u2018never settle.\u2019\u201d  When multiple apps are running at the same time, the system is optimized to always give peak performance most efficiently. \u201cWe\u2019ve chosen to go with a Snapdragon 835 processor, an 8 GB RAM and a proprietary algorithm system we\u2019ve called UX-Realm that maximizes performance so that the user experience will be most seamless,\u201d adds Sun. The smartphone\u2019s charging mechanism is also designed to ensure that the phone itself doesn\u2019t heat up when users play King of Glory and charge their phone at the same time. \nJust as important as the phone\u2019s capabilities are the actual look and feel of the physical product. \u201cPeople can tell a quality product just by touching it,\u201d says Sun of the phone\u2019s matte black finish, Bauhaus-inspired exterior and the slim bezel that wraps around the screen. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed it in a way that is comfortable to the grip, even after long stretches of time.\u201d The phone also boasts a 16- and 20-megapixel dual camera and retains a feature that many new smartphones are losing \u2014 the headphone jack. \u201cOur users play an important role during the creation process and we listen to their feedback,\u201d explains Lau. \u201cThey also set a very high threshold for what it means to create a good product.\u201d  While OnePlus has quickly become the device of choice for an increasing number of avid gamers, the benefits of OnePlus 5T\u2019s incredible specs extend beyond gaming.  \u201cOur target is to produce the best-performing phone, and the fact that OnePlus has created the best product for gaming is a byproduct of that aim,\u201d says Xi Zeng, another product manager. He says that because of the smartphone\u2019s processing capabilities, a number of A.I. studios also use OnePlus phones as a creative platform for their work. As the C.E.O. and founder of a Chinese brand, Pete Lau aspires for OnePlus to change the world\u2019s opinion that made-in-China products are inferior. \u201cBy implementing the highest production processes and adhering to international standards, we have manufactured quality products and built a solid reputation in the global market over the past four years,\u201d he says.\nThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Pete Souza Photographed the Obama Presidency. Now He Helps People Remember It.", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo surprise here: Pete Souza is big in Brooklyn.On the anniversary of Donald J. Trump\u2019s election victory, in a college auditorium steps from Hillary Clinton\u2019s former campaign headquarters, hundreds of New Yorkers lined up to meet Mr. Souza, the chief White House photographer who captured many of the waking moments of President Barack Obama, the president who came before.As emotional Brooklynites streamed in to hear him speak \u2014 and to collectively reminisce about life before the Trump era \u2014 Mr. Souza, 62, sucked on a lozenge and fretted about the projector\u2019s ability to perfectly display his photos.\u201cI\u2019m exhausted,\u201d he said just before the event began. He hadn\u2019t been sleeping well. \u201cI\u2019d better start getting wired in 10 minutes.\u201dLife as a headliner makes him uneasy. For decades, Mr. Souza\u2019s life has been about observation. Toggling between a career as a photojournalist and a White House photographer \u2014 he was also a photographer in the Reagan White House \u2014 Mr. Souza has honed an ability to crouch and shrink to capture the details no one else sees.\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out why,\u201d Mr. Souza said. \u201cWhen people come to my talk, they\u2019re not hearing from Barack Obama. They\u2019re hearing from me.\u201dHere are a few hunches: With Mr. Obama giving few public statements since leaving office, Mr. Souza\u2019s words and images will have to work as a conduit for now. Since posting a photo from a military helicopter as Mr. Obama left the White House on Inauguration Day \u2014 \u201cWe used to live there,\u201d Mr. Souza heard the departing president remark on that ride to no one in particular \u2014 Mr. Souza has been constructing a virtual timeline that juxtaposes events of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency with Mr. Trump\u2019s, one that has so far been defined by defying norms, bucking expectations and attempts to reverse the legacy of his predecessor.Mr. Souza\u2019s photo retrospectives, often laced with tongue-in-cheek captions and commentary, began during Mr. Trump\u2019s first week in the White House. In the midst of an immigration restriction order issued by the Trump administration in January, a follower commented on a photo of Mr. Obama visiting with a young refugee: \u201cHe is such a decent man. How did we fall so far?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like an untouchable place for the anti-people,\u201d Ms. Gabriner said. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised that the divisiveness of the country wouldn\u2019t be expressed on that forum.\u201dIt is one thing, Mr. Souza said, to read Instagram comments and absorb the feeling that people are collectively mourning. It is quite another to see a real-life crowd react to different lenses that he has placed on the 44th president\u2019s legacy.There are laughs when Mr. Obama is presented as a doting father and occasional goofball. When Mr. Souza became choked up speaking about the president\u2019s reaction to a shooting that killed 26 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., a tragedy Mr. Obama has referred to as the worst moment in his presidency, sniffles were audible in the crowd.In multiple interviews and during his presentation in Brooklyn, Mr. Souza declined to speak about Mr. Trump or about the many headlines that say he enjoys trolling the president, preferring instead to let his photos do the work.\u201cI think I\u2019ve been respectful and playful and subtle,\u201d Mr. Souza said, \u201cespecially compared to what some people say on Twitter.\u201dHe wouldn\u2019t name names.\u201cThis is how you should talk to the Russians,\u201d Mr. Souza said, of course, to applause.Aside from an obsession with Bruce Springsteen and baseball, Mr. Souza prefers to keep details about himself private. Reluctantly, and at the prodding of his wife, Patti Lease, he consented to showing a reporter photographs of his October 2013 wedding at the White House, a small affair studded with blue flowers, and one that illustrated how close the president and his photographer had become.In one photo, Mr. Obama is smiling at Mr. Souza, who is gazing at his new wife. The couple, whose relationship started when they were neighbors in Northern Virginia, had been together for two decades and saw no need to marry before Mr. Obama\u2019s constant badgering won out. Mr. Obama even helped select Ms. Lease\u2019s engagement ring.Ms. Lease, who teaches science in the Washington area, said that, for eight years, her second job was to gently remind her husband about the world beyond the White House gates. There were few days off: Mr. Souza\u2019s Christmas morning routine was often a stop at McDonald\u2019s on the way to work. Where the president went \u2014 Hawaii, Afghanistan, Walter Reed Army Medical Center \u2014 Mr. Souza went, too.In the foreword for Mr. Souza\u2019s book, Mr. Obama wrote, \u201cI probably spent more time with Pete Souza than with anybody other than my family.\u201dMr. Souza said that he felt \u201ca little offended\u201d by the criticism that journalists had equated his photography to government handouts. \u201cThese are authentic pictures,\u201d Mr. Souza said of his work, \u201cmore so than when the press pool comes in for 30 seconds and it\u2019s hard to have a real moment happen.\u201dHowever it was won, his access was enough to fill a coffee-table book with hundreds of photos. It weighs six pounds, and in Brooklyn, people lugged multiple copies up to Mr. Souza for a signing. As she passed her copy to Mr. Souza, Audrey Bansil, a new mother who lives in the area, asked him to sign it for her 11-month-old son, Luke.\u201cThis was a really inspirational time in history, and I want him to know about it,\u201d Ms. Bansil, 35, said of her son. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy he was born in that administration.

{"Headline": "Travel Books Take You There and Back", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoundupSure, Freya Stark risked life and limb traveling through Persia to give us her classic \u201cThe Valleys of the Assassins,\u201d and the indomitable Dervla Murphy has been to, and written about, almost everywhere, often with her daughter in tow (and sometimes a mule), but all too often the luxurious chore of travel writing has belonged to the men. So it\u2019s worth noting that some of this season\u2019s most exciting travel narratives are by women.With lyrical economy, she recalls the summers of her childhood along \u201cEurope\u2019s southernmost Iron Curtain,\u201d where \u201cevery second barman was in the service of the Bulgarian State Security.\u201d But upon her return, Kassabova discovers that the \u201cred Riviera\u201d of her youth has given way to a land of misfits lingering in a limbo of fading hope and warped memory. The picture she paints is one of a place out of time, a forgotten, singular, in-between land. A local bar owner notes, \u201cLiving here is like a joke without a punch line.\u201d Yet this is also a place that clearly intoxicates Kassabova, and leaving is \u201clike pulling myself out with a corkscrew.\u201dMaking her way west through northern Thrace, Kassabova encounters \u201ca hub for \u2026 desperados and smugglers.\u201d Along the high passes of the Rhodope Mountains, things are so treacherous that \u201cyou would biodegrade at the bottom of the gorge and vultures would pick your bones clean.\u201d This is a land of curses, of mysterious fireballs in the sky that may or may not be dragons, and of dancing priests.It\u2019s not surprising that Kassabova \u2014 who has written three poetry collections, a novel and three memoirs \u2014 demonstrates a descriptive sensitivity on the page (climbing in the mountains, she feels \u201cthe pitiless sun hammering my head like a judgment for some distant crime\u201d). But she also possesses the gift that\u2019s bestowed on only the best of travel writers: an ability to zero in on characters who illuminate the condition of a place at a moment in time.At one point, Kassabova comes across a fortuneteller who answers her secret, unasked question. \u201cWhat you have begun you will complete,\u201d the woman, reading a handful of tossed beans, assures her, \u201cbut you must heed the signs along the way. Never ever ignore the signs.\u201d Luckily for both author and reader, Kassabova seems indeed to have heeded every sign and missed nothing along the way.Bunting follows in a long tradition of English writers escaping up to the region where the land fractures and frays. To her predecessors, she notes, \u201cthe Hebrides offered \u2026 an unusual degree of personal freedom from convention and class.\u201d It was on Jura, with a population of fewer than 200, that George Orwell retreated to write \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four.\u201d Bunting makes a pilgrimage to where he \u201cset up his typewriter in front of the window overlooking the sea, and with that vista in front of him, he infused the novel with a pervasive horror of the dirty, urban tedium of its setting.\u201d Later she reminds us that it was on the wind-battered island of Iona that Irish monks seeking a hermit\u2019s life gave the world the magnificent gift of \u201cThe Book of Kells.\u201dHistory along this coast, Bunting notes early on, \u201cis unruly, and does not fit into an orderly narrative.\u201d Eventually, though, that history, \u201cmute with trauma,\u201d speaks forcibly to her: \u201cI had encountered multiple types of loss on my journey: of land, language, country and nation.\u201d Her travels culminate in a visit to the Hebrides\u2019 most iconic ruin, St. Kilda. After centuries of habitation, the final 36 residents requested evacuation from this remotest of communities in 1930. For Bunting, the loss still reverberates.Running under her entire narrative are the feelings Bunting has for her homeland, England, and for the larger entity of Britain. It\u2019s this relationship that\u2019s eventually called into question and cuts deepest. She has justifiable difficulty reconciling, among other injustices, the removal of people from their land at the hands of the Crown during the 18th and 19th centuries: \u201cNo other country in Europe witnessed such brutal clearances.\u201d This larger reckoning is what ultimately gives \u201cLove of Country\u201d its power and resonance. After all, what is love \u2014 of people, institutions or country \u2014 but the attempt to reconcile what cannot be easily reconciled?The story picks up in the early 1970s in the midst of the long South American \u201cdream honeymoon\u201d of FitzGerald and her new husband, Fitz. That they survive a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle, then escape a penal colony, only sets the stage for their real troubles.Making their way to freedom in the backwater of Puerto Maldonado, the couple learn that they\u2019re stranded. It\u2019s then that a mysterious, well-dressed stranger approaches their table at a local restaurant. \u201cI can\u2019t help but overhear your difficulty,\u201d he begins. The man, who turns out to be a gold prospector, suggests they use a raft and float the five days downriver to Riberalta, gateway to points beyond. \u201cNo harm can come to you,\u201d he insists.Trouble arrives that first night. Unable to steer the raft in the powerful current, they miss the border checkpoint into Bolivia and shots tear through the darkness into their makeshift tent. But soon the days and nights are blissful. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve ever felt so liberated,\u201d FitzGerald recalls.Then, on the fourth night, a drenching lightning storm hits. A tree collapses on the raft, missing FitzGerald\u2019s head by inches. They almost sink in the tempest but manage to escape. Dawn brings the discovery that their raft has been taken far off course \u2014 they\u2019re stranded deep in a swamp that rises during the rainy season. Worse, their supply of food has been lost.In this world of water, the FitzGeralds struggle in vain to find their way back to the river\u2019s current. They endure fire ants, suffer sunstroke and nearly drown in sucking mud. They sleep in a tree. Fear of attack by caiman, jaguar and piranha is constant. Strange glowing eyes peer at them nightly from the jungle. Bees swarm over every inch of their bodies \u2014 something they become nearly immune to.And they starve, for page after harrowing page, for 26 days, until they are come upon \u2014 near death, emaciated \u2014 by two Indians out hunting for turtles. The couple endure, maintaining hope and affection for each other. It\u2019s this that elevates \u201cRuthless River\u201d above the typically heroic tale of survival. In simple, unsentimental terms, Holly FitzGerald has given us a most unlikely love story.The latest book\u2019s editor, Lavinia Spalding, hungry for travelers who \u201cgo with an open heart\u201d and have \u201cthe inclination to practice human kindness, a sincere intention to build pathways of understanding and a willingness to be transformed,\u201d read nearly 500 submissions before settling on the 31 stories that make up this diverse collection.In the opener, Zora O\u2019Neill finds herself drawn away from a resort\u2019s placid blue waters and toward the newly formed refugee camps that have sprung up on the Greek island she and her family visit every year. Like so many of the stories here, \u201cOn the Migrant Trail\u201d is told with simple grace. O\u2019Neill\u2019s account demonstrates once again that history\u2019s first draft is often written by the intrepid traveler.As a young woman, she is led by her hunger for enlightenment to the island of Corfu. There she falls in love for the first time \u2014 not only with a man but, after an epiphany at the sight of an egg fried in olive oil, with the deep pleasures of good food simply prepared. Upon her return to America, health problems force her further in the direction of conscious eating, and her fate is sealed at a San Francisco farmers\u2019 market \u201cone Saturday morning in spring when a farmer held out a pea to me and changed my world.\u201dHuber is prone to such pronouncements and the reader might be excused for slipping into cynicism, except for Huber\u2019s wholehearted belief in her path. Finding her soul mate, Christopher, she sets out to make a career of her ardor for food. Passion carries the day over pragmatism and the two \u2014 victims of wanderlust \u2014 are off to Costa Rica, Paris, Guatemala, Italy, even Minnesota. Eventually Huber meets a man who might be called \u2014 to slip into the parlance of this charming foodie\u2019s travel memoir \u2014 her guardian angel, the chef Bruce Aidells, who magically appears at key moments and helps Huber land a job as a recipe tester.Although Huber wears her zeal and her spiritual beliefs on her sleeve as she moves from one inspiration to the next, she\u2019s endearing, engaging company and the reader roots for her success. Eventually Huber and Christopher adopt a baby, victories begin to accumulate, and the three approach a happy ending that Huber knows is merely another new beginning in her larger journey.\u201cThere has always been romance in distance,\u201d she reminds us. Yet it\u2019s the push-pull of the desire to leave coupled with the \u201cstrong attachment to the comfort, the privacy, the intimacy, and the pride of home\u201d that has shaped Freed\u2019s life. \u201cThe rhythm of leaving and returning has kept me nicely unsettled for over 45 years.\u201d Without it, she confesses, \u201cI would have drowned any desire to write in restlessness and despair.\u201dFreed approaches the world \u2014 and her prose \u2014 with the cleareyed, forthright wonder required of the most committed of travelers. In the essay \u201cKeeping Watch,\u201d she recalls growing up \u201cluxurious but not rich, safe and yet threatened, carefree if one did not think too carefully about the future,\u201d in apartheid-era South Africa, and of her childhood terrors at the prospect of a \u201cKnife-at-the-Throat day\u201d when the servants might \u201crise as one.\u201dElsewhere she speaks eloquently of travel\u2019s power to transform: \u201cThe traveling writer is someone seeking \u2026 a sort of non-existence, the quest for which can lead, paradoxically, to the discovery of the self set free from the bafflement of context.\u201d And in the deceptively economic essay called \u201cLocked In,\u201d she reminds us just how perilous it sometimes is to be a woman in the world, no matter how seemingly placid the setting.Freed is also one of the funniest writers around. And in \u201cUseful Zulu Phrases, 1986,\u201d the laugh gets caught in the throat as she offers a hilarious list of some of the helpful hints that were once offered white South Africans attempting to learn Zulu in order to better command and control their black servants. In \u201cCaveat Viator,\u201d she gives us a blistering, bone-true indictment of new age man\u2019s self-aggrandizing struggles to be at harmony with the natural world \u2014 from Northern California to Africa.In this marvelous collection\u2019s final essay, \u201cWhen Enough Is Enough,\u201d Freed may be speaking for road warriors everywhere when she confesses to the occasional urge to \u201cflee the things and the people that seem to hold me in place, to grab what\u2019s left of the life and make a run for it.\u201dAndrew McCarthy is the author of the young adult novel \u201cJust Fly Away\u201d and the travel memoir \u201cThe Longest Way Home.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Start of the Season", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplayTUESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 If you\u2019re going to have an existential crisis, having one over words and their value in crossword puzzles is probably as good a reason as any to have one.This goes double if it inspires a person to make his debut in The New York Times Crossword.While this is an interesting idea, I wish there had been one or two fewer theme entries and better nontheme fill. There are a lot of three letter gluey bits in the grid, but I think that as Mr. Poulos gains more experience and fine-tunes his word lists, that will get better, especially since he seems to be aware of the issue to begin with.What a great idea for a theme! Given the word-nerdy kinship between neologism watchers and crossword lovers, I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s the first time this theme has been attempted.The American Dialect Society has been awarding Word of the Year honors since 1990, but maybe it took this long for the stars to align just right \u2014 after all, the last two WOTY winners, SINGULAR THEY (2015) and DUMPSTER FIRE (2016), are nicely symmetrical (12 letters, with the same 8-4 enumeration).34A: The start of the season, other than the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade, is TIS, as is \u201cTis the season.\u201d26D: \u201cApril Fools sign?\u201d is not looking for sign of a prank, but of the astrological sign for April 1. That would be ARIES.This puzzle came about as a result of a minor philosophical crisis.I\u2019d read a blog post where the author was complaining about a puzzle that he felt \u201clacked fresh fill.\u201d This complaint surprised me, because I\u2019d personally found the puzzle in question to be quite lively.It got me wondering: what do we mean when we talk about \u201cfresh fill\u201d? What separates perfectly O.K., workhorse words from gnarly crosswordese? Can clever cluing turn a stale word fresh? And when does a word go from \u201cfresh\u201d to faddish, twee, or just plain annoying?I soon began to doubt everything I knew about cruciverbalism and, indeed, language itself.Around the same time, I read on Language Log (a blog run by an international supergroup of academic linguists) that the American Dialect Society had recently announced \u201cDUMPSTER FIRE\u201d as their 2016 Word of the Year. It struck me that if there were one word everyone could agree on as \u201cfresh,\u201d surely it\u2019d be the A.D.S. Word of the Year.So I made a puzzle based on that idea.My initial plan was to seed the past several years\u2019 winners anywhere I could fit them into a grid. But when I looked at the WotY list, I realized the word lengths might allow for symmetric placement. Luckily, I was able to pull it off.I\u2019m super-duper thrilled for this to be my debut puzzle in The Times. Thanks to my friends and family (especially Cliff, Nick, and the Daves Madden and Sheppard) for their support and feedback. Thanks also to Mr. Shortz for actually accepting this thing, and editing the clues to be better and more consistent overall.My only regret is that UHF is no longer clued as \u201c1989 \u2018Weird Al\u2019 film set at a low-budget TV station.\u201dMaybe this will make you feel better, Mr. Poulos. If nothing else, it will bring back the 1980s for you in a big way:Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Blue Apron\u2019s Co-Founder Steps Down as C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here are some stories we are watching:\u2022 The Bitcoin rocket has wobbled. Is a crash coming?\u2022 T. Boone Pickens begins to step back from public life.Shares of Blue Apron have struggled since it went public in June. The company priced its initial public offering at $10, 40 percent below its target. Since then, the stock has tumbled 70 percent to $2.99.Blue Apron has faced increased competition from Amazon and rival meal-kit delivery start-ups. Amazon\u2019s announcement on June 16 that it would purchase Whole Foods Market weighed heavily on the offering. Since then, the company has done little to assuage investors. It has reported losing customers for two straight quarters and has laid off hundreds of employees.The Dow Jones Industrial Average smashed through 24,000 on Thursday. Increased optimism that the Senate will pass the Republican tax bill pushed the index up more than 300 points to close at 24,273 today.The rally extends a record run for the blue-chip index this year. The Dow has gained 21 percent this year.Here is a quick look at the run:\u2022The Dow has crossed five millennial markers this year, the most on record.\u2022 It took the Dow just 30 days to go from 23000 to 24000, the third fastest 1,000 point move in history.\u2022 The Dow has had 63 record closes this year.\u2022 the index is up 271 percent since March 9, 2009, the bear market low.A stated goal of the Republican tax overhaul was to prevent corporations from shifting profits to low-tax countries.Several academic economists, legal scholars and the Coalition for a Prosperous America argued Wednesday that the Republican plan speeding its way through Congress does not sufficiently address this issue.Daniel Alpert, founder of Westwood Capital and an adviser to the Coalition for a Prosperous America, writes that United States companies \u201cwill continue to face competition\u201d from multinational corporations \u201cthat will continue to divert their taxable income to tax haven jurisdictions around the world.\u201d\u201cThe GOP congressional leadership and the White House could and should have embarked on real corporate tax reform, that is in the national interest and broadens the tax base while trimming marginal rates.\u201dIn a letter to Congress, the group advocated for the adoption of sales factor apportionment:\u201cRedefining the source of income is, in our view, the key to correcting the current dysfunction. This is what the sales factor apportionment system, already in use by most US states, does. Corporations earn income from sales. Therefore income should be allocated based upon the destination of those sales. MNC income should no longer be allocated based upon the location of a subsidiary that allegedly earned it. The location of sales is much more difficult to manipulate than the \u201corigin of income\u201d under the current system.\u201cThe US tax base for corporations would be calculated on the basis of a fraction of companies\u2019 worldwide income. This fraction would be the share of each company\u2019s worldwide sales that are destined for customers in the United States. The taxpayer, under SFA, is the whole unitary business, including all evasion-motivated subsidiaries over which the parent corporations exercise legal and economic control.\u201d\u201cIn effect, firms should be taxed on their access to a specific consumer market - from which they generate revenue - rather than on their cleverness at artificially allocating expenses and revenue in tax havens in which their subsidiaries \u2018incorporate.\u2019\u201d\u201cI think Aspen\u2019s work is needed more than ever. We have to have a table that people can gather around, to share perspectives and ideas and to translate those ideas into action. It really matters that we commit ourselves to evidence-based argumentation, to respecting what has been established through science, building upon past knowledge. Part of what\u2019s made this country great is a commitment to being reality based and to being factually grounded. Public policy has grown out of so much serious research.\u201dThe Royal Bank of Scotland told staff on Thursday that it was formally closing its internal bad bank, an important milestone as Chief Executive Ross McEwan works to turn around the British bank.Since the division was started in 2008, the bank, based in Edinburgh, has exited 22 countries, cut its risk-weighted assets by more than half and shrunk its assets to 752 billion, or about $1 trillion. The bank held as much as \u00a32.2 trillion in assets.Closing the Capital Resolution unit is an important moment, but the bank\u2019s turnaround is far from finished.R.B.S. has not reported an annual profit in nine years. It is not expected to report an annual profit until 2018 despite reporting a profit in the first half of this year.The bank passed a stress test by the Bank of England this year that measured the ability of lenders to weather another financial crisis, but remained among the weakest of the biggest British banks. (It was forced to bolster its capital last year after failing the regulatory test.)R.B.S. also remains 72 percent owned by the British government following a bailout during the financial crisis. The government said this month that it plans to resume sales of its holdings by 2019 and hopes to sell some \u00a315 billion of its stake by 2022.That process will be helped if R.B.S. can continue to improve its profitability and its capital position. A return to paying a dividend next year also would be a welcome sign for shareholders.From the WSJ:\u201cBelieve me, I didn\u2019t have this much fun with T. Rowe Price, \u201d said the retired secretary and taxi driver Ms. Scott, referring to her mutual-fund investments.Steven Mnuchin and other White House officials have argued that the Republican tax overhaul plans would pay for themselves through higher economic growth. And there were studies to prove that, even as critics say that tax cuts wouldn\u2019t have such an effect.An economist at the Office of Tax Analysis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize his job, said Treasury had not released a \u201cdynamic\u201d analysis showing that the tax plan would be paid for with economic growth because one did not exist.Instead, Treasury staffers have done smaller analyses of individual provisions.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedStarting with putting his 65,000-acre Mesa Vista Ranch in Texas up for sale, with a price tag of $250 million.Slowly but inevitably, my fading vision and limited hearing have forced me to give up things I\u2019ve loved and excelled at \u2014 golf and hunting, in particular. Although the beauty of Mesa Vista remains intact, the ranch roads I have driven thousands of times are now blurred. It\u2019s time to embrace and accept that my life has changed.It\u2019s acknowledgment by the 89-year-old Mr. Pickens that he is in his twilight years, after having built a fortune as an oil magnate and then a financier who rose to fame during the corporate raider period of the 1980s.In selling the Mesa Vista Ranch, the mogul said that he wants to make sure that it ends up with a buyer who will carry on his conservation efforts.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe firing of Matt Lauer from NBC News for \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace\u201d marks one of the highest-profile dismissals yet in business for misconduct and abuse. It also highlights the potential financial impact of those violations.Much of Mr. Lauer\u2019s power stemmed from the bond he had forged with viewers as the longest tenured host in the program\u2019s 65 years. The first two hours of \u201cToday\u201d \u2014 Mr. Lauer\u2019s showcase \u2014 generated $508 million in revenue last year, more than the amount brought in by the other network morning shows, according to Kantar Media.And while \u201cToday\u201d trails ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in total viewers, it still leads in the coveted 25-to-54 advertising demographic.The bigger pictureAt the end of the day, any company is better off \u2014 and I do mean financially better off \u2014 without someone who uses their power for inappropriate sexual behavior that makes the workplace a threatening place for colleagues and stymies women\u2019s ability to climb the ranks.A senior financial executive phoned Michael last night to complain about how the Senate tax plan would endanger the private equity industry because it limits the deductibility of corporate debt interest payments \u2014 and applies that even to existing investments. The provision could completely upend the private equity business model, this person asserted.Dell took on about $50 billion in debt for its merger with EMC Corp. At a roughly 5 percent interest rate, that means the company has about $2 billion in annual interest payments. The House and Senate bills would remove at least half those deductions, Mr. Vallone said in an interview Wednesday. At a 20 percent tax rate, that\u2019s a $200 million hit each year.The state of playThe Senate could vote as soon as tomorrow on its tax plan. But there are plenty of unresolved matters:While the 3.7 percent drop in an index tracking Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google was the biggest in 21 months, the amount of lost money exceeded any other single day on record. At about $60 billion, the decline in their combined market value is poised to eclipse any since Facebook arrived in public markets.What\u2019s behind the drop? It could be as simple as investors believing that the huge run-up in tech stocks this year has reached its natural end, and that changes to tax policy would provide a lift to other industries.The tech and media flyaroundSpeaking at the Economic Club of New York, Randall Stephenson of AT&T said that he had been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest defenders in the corporate world when it came to public policy. And then the Justice Department sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner.The company, which collects and analyzes data for industrial companies, got the money from a new investor, the British money manager Baillie Gifford, and the existing backers Revolution Growth and GreatPoint Ventures.\u201cI have never seen a case where there were so many bad things done like Uber has done in this case.\u201dAdvertisement"}
