{"Headline": "The Search for History in a Runyonesque Enclave", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "The restaurateur Dean Poll has worked to uncover the history behind Gallaghers, a 90-year-old steakhouse that was once a hangout for gangsters and Broadway stars.Supported byThe conversation turned to old New York \u2014 specifically, old New York restaurants. The restaurateur Dean J. Poll was doing the remembering.Next he mentioned Gallaghers, a shrine to Runyonesque celebrities that has a meat locker in its front window on West 52nd Street in Manhattan. It had been a hangout for gangsters and Broadway stars and many who were indebted to the former and in love with the latter. Later, it turned up in the gossip columns because guests like Gloria Vanderbilt, Muhammad Ali, Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Jackson were worth a mention.But Gallaghers is not gone. Mr. Poll took it over in 2013 and presided over a $5 million renovation. \u201cMore of a restoration than a renovation,\u201d he said.This is not preservation in the way historic preservationists talk about it. Gallaghers has history, but Mr. Poll, 60, bought the place without knowing much more than what he remembered from his boyhood as the son of a restaurateur. In the 1970s, his father ran a restaurant a few blocks away in the Time & Life Building.\u201cI\u2019d see that meat box,\u201d he said, referring to the locker at the front of Gallaghers. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018That\u2019s the kind of place I want, so you can display what you bought, show what you were doing at 3 in the morning, 4 in the morning.\u2019\u201d As he became the back-of-the-house boss at restaurants he ran, on his own and with his father, he came to regard the front window as a trophy case for days that began early in the meatpacking district.Once he owned Gallaghers, he went exploring, climbing through two vacant floors in the building above the restaurant that he said \u201clooked like the haunted house from Disneyland.\u201d What he discovered were stacks of old menus, ashtrays, cocktail napkins and matchbooks from different eras in Gallaghers\u2019 long history.\u201cI started looking up stuff and found that Gallagher was part of Gallagher and Shean, a vaudeville team,\u201d he said. Shean was Al Shean, whose sister was Minnie Marx, the mother of the Marx Brothers. \u201cAnd a lot of pictures were inscribed to Jack Solomon,\u201d Mr. Poll said, \u201cso I wanted to find out about him.\u201dThe restaurant\u2019s creative director, Amy Zimmerman, began searching eBay for more memorabilia, and a publicist Mr. Poll hired, Regina McMenamin, quickly became an amateur historian, spending months reading old newspaper articles about Gallaghers.Along the way, they discovered that just before the restaurant changed its name to Gallaghers in November 1927, it was a speakeasy called Club Evelyn. The Evelyn was Evelyn Nesbit. Some consider her the first supermodel, famous at the turn of the century as a figure for sculptors and early fashion photographers \u2014 and infamous for an affair with the renowned architect Stanford White.She later married Harry K. Thaw, a wildly jealous industrialist from Pittsburgh, and in 1906, Thaw fatally shot White at Madison Square Garden. Movie fans know about her from \u201cThe Girl in the Red Velvet Swing,\u201d a 1955 film in which she was played by Joan Collins, then 22.Apparently, Thaw could not get Nesbit out of his mind. In November 1927, soon after he was released from a mental hospital, he showed up at Club Evelyn and got into a row with his own bodyguard. Thaw pounded the table, then raked his arm across it, sending the bottles and glasses flying. Nesbit said that for the hot-tempered Thaw, it was a \u201cmild\u201d tantrum. \u201cHarry has carried on this way before,\u201d she was quoted as saying.Thaw said the accounts of what had happened were exaggerated, but he did not dispute the size of the check he paid. It was between $200 and $250, equivalent to between $2,850 and $3,564 now.Ms. McMenamin said she found that the steaks for Club Evelyn were supplied by Helen Gallagher, the soon-to-be ex-wife of a Broadway star. Jack Solomon, the man Mr. Poll wanted to research because of photographs in the restaurant, was her partner and, later, her husband. And when Nesbit quit, three weeks after the episode with Thaw, the restaurant\u2019s name was changed to Gallaghers. (Nesbit had owned Chez Evelyn with Jules Martin, who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the gangster Dutch Schultz, a mastermind of, among things, restaurant shakedown schemes. But when she left, she accused Martin of withholding profits. Schultz later shot and killed Martin, claiming Martin was skimming from the shakedown money.)Mr. Poll, 60, said he had made overtures for Gallaghers as far back as 2010 before working out a deal in 2013. He said the previous owner had gone so far toward shutting down Gallaghers that the workers had been given 90 days\u2019 notice, as required by their union, Unite Here Local 100.He and the president of Local 100, Bill Granfield, said they had gotten along well, in contrast to the labor history at another restaurant Mr. Poll runs, the Boathouse, in Central Park. There, a different local, Local 6, went on strike for 44 days in 2011. Mr. Poll attributed the walkout to a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d with union leaders.\u201cWe have since coexisted with respect,\u201d he said.In renovating Gallaghers, Mr. Poll kept the U-shaped bar and the original grills, which he said use 15 bags of charcoal every day.But not everything that looks old at Gallaghers is original.Ms. McMenamin said some customers see the urinals in the men\u2019s room and say, \u201cBabe Ruth then, Derek Jeter now.\u201dMr. Poll said that was only half right \u2014 Ruth no, Mr. Jeter yes.He said the urinals had come from the stables at John Hay Whitney\u2019s estate in Manhasset, N.Y., near where he grew up. He bought them at a salvage store in Harlem about 15 years ago and used them in a restaurant he ran on Long Island before moving them to Gallaghers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meg Whitman to Step Down as Hewlett Packard Enterprise C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMeg Whitman is stepping down as chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise six years after joining its corporate predecessor and leading a turnaround effort that split the Silicon Valley corporate icon in two.Ms. Whitman, 61, will retire in February, the company said on Tuesday. She will be succeeded by Antonio Neri, 50, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s president.At Hewlett-Packard, Ms. Whitman inherited an aging, troubled company and delivered mixed results. She oversaw rounds of cost-cutting and then decided to break up the company. Ms. Whitman went with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which took the business software and hardware operations of the parent company. The other half of the company, HP Inc., houses the printer and personal computer business.The job at Hewlett-Packard presented a very different challenge from her first stint in the tech world. In 1998, she joined a fledgling start-up, eBay, steering it as it rode the early growth of the internet and making Ms. Whitman a billionaire.\u201cAt HP, she was handed a tough hand in a legacy business \u2014 the opposite of eBay,\u201d said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research. \u201cShe was a complete realist about the business, and generally did a good job.\u201dMs. Whitman is one of the nation\u2019s most prominent female executives. Before joining eBay, she already had an impressive resume \u2014 a Harvard M.B.A. with management jobs at some of the nation\u2019s top companies, including Procter & Gamble, Bain & Company, Walt Disney and Hasbro.Ms. Whitman was one of the three finalists to succeed Travis Kalanick as chief executive at Uber this year after he left the company, which he co-founded, over concerns that his leadership had helped it become a toxic workplace.In a $13.5 billion transaction completed this year, for example, Hewlett Packard Enterprise combined its services business with Computer Sciences Corporation to create a separate company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, called DXC Technology.The Hewlett Packard Enterprise that has emerged, Ms. Whitman said this year, will be a streamlined company with \u201ca crystal-clear mission\u201d to help its business customers achieve the payoff from new technologies, including cloud computing, data analytics and the internet of things.The company has also sought to strengthen its remaining businesses with a handful of acquisitions, including the $1.1 billion purchase this year of Nimble Storage, a start-up and a leader in the fast-growing market for so-called flash storage.Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s share price is about where it was when it became a stand-alone company. But including share buybacks and dividend payments totaling nearly $18 billion, the total shareholder return is 89 percent, the company said.In after-hours trading on Tuesday, Hewlett Packard Enterprise shares fell nearly 7 percent.In a brief interview on Tuesday, Ms. Whitman said it had been a \u201cprivilege\u201d to lead Hewlett-Packard through the challenges of recent years. The two companies that emerged, she said, are leaner, more innovative and healthy competitors in the modern technology industry. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of that,\u201d Ms. Whitman said.Her plans, she said, are not yet set. Ms. Whitman said she would take time off and go skiing, and she is the incoming chairwoman of Teach for America. Other than that, Ms. Whitman said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dShe added: \u201cI\u2019ve been working straight for 35 years. I\u2019m going to enjoy some downtime.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are Honey Nut Cheerios Healthy? We Look Inside the Box", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI had a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios recently. It\u2019d been awhile. Regular Cheerios are more my thing. But sometimes I finish my box faster than my kids do and find myself straying to their side of the cupboard.Honey Nut is America\u2019s best-selling breakfast cereal, and by a comfortable margin. Roughly 151 million boxes and other containers of various sizes were sold over the past year, well ahead of the second best-selling breakfast cereal, Frosted Flakes, according to IRI, a Chicago based market research firm.I had no idea. The only thing I could think about when I ate it again for the first time in years was how incredibly sweet it is. I looked at the back of the box and could see why. Three of the top six ingredients are sweeteners: sugar, brown sugar and honey.I asked General Mills about this, over a period of several days. They did not come to the phone, but responded with a series of communiqu\u00e9s.\u201cYou mentioned that three of the top six ingredients in Honey Nut Cheerios are sugar, brown sugar and honey,\u201d Mike Siemienas, a spokesman for the company, wrote in a statement. \u201cWhat you didn\u2019t mention is that the number one ingredient is oats. To be so singularly focused on one ingredient \u2014 sugar \u2014 is irresponsible and doesn\u2019t help consumers look at the total nutrition offered.\u201d\u201cThe company has capitalized on the good name of the original,\u201d Ms. Liebman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for years that Honey Nut Cheerios has more sugar than honey and more salt than nuts, in fact it\u2019s got no nuts at all, it\u2019s just got almond flavor.\u201dThe serving size of regular Cheerios remains one cup. If Honey Nut Cheerios still had a one cup serving size, the sugar content would be in the double digits.General Mills said little about what had happened, or when.\u201cThere are several reasons that changes in serving size may occur including recipe improvements that may change the density of the cereal or regulation changes,\u201d Mr. Siemienas wrote.Serving sizes are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and can change if a cereal\u2019s density changes. It appears that at some point in the last 10 or 15 years, General Mills tweaked the ingredients of Honey Nut Cheerios in a way that lowered the overall weight per serving, which had the effect of helping lower the stated sugar content. It has not been all smoke and mirrors; the percentage of sugar has decreased slightly as well, though rounding makes it difficult to say by how much.\u201cThey\u2019ve tested and tested and tested to try to find out how much sugar they can take out without it affecting sales,\u201d said Marion Nestle, an emerita professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University. \u201cThey must surely be at the cut point.\u201dShe said \u201cyou really want\u201d kids \u201ceating a whole grain, higher fiber cereal.\u201dSpeaking for myself, I eat a lot more cereal than three-quarters of a cup. I poured that amount into a bowl. It looked sad. And small. It was an appetizer\u2019s worth of Cheerios.Don\u2019t worry, General Mills. I\u2019ll continue to eat Cheerios. But I had to have a difficult conversation with a 12-year-old recently. I broke the news that Honey Nut would not be returning to the cupboard. We\u2019d be sticking with regular Cheerios.\u201cCan I just pour honey on it?\u201d he asked.He was joking. I think.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Hid 2016 Breach, Paying Hackers to Delete Stolen Data", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber disclosed Tuesday that hackers had stolen 57 million driver and rider accounts and that the company had kept the data breach secret for more than a year after paying a $100,000 ransom.The deal was arranged by the company\u2019s chief security officer and under the watch of the former chief executive, Travis Kalanick, according to several current and former employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were private.The security officer, Joe Sullivan, has been fired. Mr. Kalanick was forced out in June, although he remains on Uber\u2019s board.The two hackers stole data about the company\u2019s riders and drivers \u2014 including phone numbers, email addresses and names \u2014 from a third-party server and then approached Uber and demanded $100,000 to delete their copy of the data, the employees said.Uber acquiesced to the demands, and then went further. The company tracked down the hackers and pushed them to sign nondisclosure agreements, according to the people familiar with the matter. To further conceal the damage, Uber executives also made it appear as if the payout had been part of a \u201cbug bounty\u201d \u2014 a common practice among technology companies in which they pay hackers to attack their software to test for soft spots.The details of the attack remained hidden until Tuesday. The ride-hailing company said it had discovered the breach as part of a board investigation into Uber\u2019s business practices.But the handling of the breach underscores the extent to which Uber executives were willing to go to protect the $70 billion ride-hailing giant\u2019s reputation and business, even at the potential cost of breaking users\u2019 trust and, perhaps more important, state and federal laws. The New York attorney general\u2019s office said on Tuesday that it had opened an investigation into the matter.A spokeswoman for Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.The breach is also a black mark for Mr. Sullivan, who was a prominent figure in the information security industry. Mr. Sullivan joined Uber as the company\u2019s first chief security officer in 2015, after serving as the head of security at Facebook for seven years.Unlike many cybersecurity executives, Mr. Sullivan was previously a lawyer and had studied cyberlaw at the University of Miami. He began his career in the technology industry as a federal prosecutor during the tech boom of the late 1990s, working at companies including eBay in 2002, where he was head of trust and safety.Mr. Sullivan\u2019s decision to join Uber was seen as a win for the company. As Uber\u2019s ranks of drivers and riders had grown, people in and outside the company became worried about privacy and security. Uber had faced complaints about driver and rider assaults, as well as allegations that it was not doing enough to protect rider data. Mr. Sullivan was tasked with keeping drivers and riders safe.The other Uber employee who was fired alongside Mr. Sullivan was Craig Clark, the company\u2019s legal director of security and law enforcement. Neither Mr. Sullivan nor Mr. Clark responded to requests for comment.\u201cCompanies are funding organized crime, an industry of criminals is being created,\u201d said Kevin Beaumont, a cybersecurity expert based in Britain. \u201cThe good guys are creating a market for the bad guys. We\u2019re enabling them to monetize what years ago would have been teenagers in bedrooms breaching companies for fun.\u201dThis latest breach puts Uber in another difficult situation just as the company is working to repair its battered image and preparing to seek an initial public offering in 2019. Mr. Khosrowshahi has characterized his tenure at the company as \u201cUber 2.0.\u201d As part of that, he has tossed out the aggressive corporate values that were prized by Mr. Kalanick and given the ride-hailing service a new list of values that includes \u201cdoing the right thing. Period.\u201dUber has hired Matt Olsen, former general counsel at the National Security Agency, as an adviser, and has retained Mandiant, a security firm, to conduct an independent investigation of the security breach. Uber said Mr. Olsen planned to reorganize the company\u2019s security team.But the damage has already been done, and Uber officials are aware of the long road back to good standing with the public.While it is not illegal to pay money to hackers, Uber may have violated several laws in its interaction with them.By demanding that the hackers destroy the stolen data, Uber may have violated a Federal Trade Commission rule on breach disclosure that prohibits companies from destroying any forensic evidence in the course of their investigation.The company may have also violated state breach disclosure laws by not disclosing the theft of Uber drivers\u2019 stolen data. If the data stolen was not encrypted, Uber would have been required by California state law to disclose that driver\u2019s license data from its drivers had been stolen in the course of the hacking.An Uber spokesman declined to comment.Mike Isaac and Sheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco, and Katie Benner from New York.

{"Headline": "For Tweet Mocking Mugabe, New Jersey Woman Could Face 20 Years in Prison", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 A young American woman living in Zimbabwe will be tried on charges of attempting to overthrow the government of Zimbabwe with a tweet mocking President Robert Mugabe, the world\u2019s oldest head of state.The arrest of the woman, Martha O\u2019Donovan, 25, has raised fears that the Zimbabwean government is stepping up efforts to control social media ahead of national elections in 2018. Mr. Mugabe, who will be 94 next year, is running for re-election despite his increasingly frail health.Ms. O\u2019Donovan was arrested on Friday at her home in Harare and charged with subverting the government and undermining the authority of \u2014 or insulting \u2014 the president. She faces up to 20 years in prison.But on Thursday, a high court judge in Harare granted bail to Ms. O\u2019Donovan and openly expressed skepticism of the charges against her.The judge, Clement Phiri, said that Ms. O\u2019Donovan had \u201cshowed that she has a plausible defense.\u201d He added that \u201cit appears, prima facie,\u201d that there was no evidence of a plot \u201cto overthrow the government.\u201dShe has surrendered her passport and was ordered not to leave the country. A trial date has yet to be set.Ms. O\u2019Donovan, of Martinsville, N.J., is a 2014 graduate of New York University\u2019s Gallatin School of Individualized Study and is a project coordinator for Magamba Network, which produces political satire and comedy. She lives in Harare, the Zimbabwean capital.Prosecutors said that, starting in February, Ms. O\u2019Donovan had \u201csystematically sought to incite political unrest through the expansion, development and use of a sophisticated network of social media platforms as well as running some Twitter accounts.\u201dMs. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s goal, prosecutors charged, was to \u201creplicate offline uprisings like what happened in Tunisia and Egypt\u201d in 2011.The @matigary account \u2014 which has accumulated a wide following, including among Zimbabwean journalists, for incisive posts about Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government \u2014 has continued to tweet since Ms. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s arrest.A social media campaign started by the organization under the hashtag #FreeMartha urges Zimbabweans to call for her release, and is being spread by local and international rights groups.David McGuire, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Harare, said it was \u201cmonitoring Martha\u2019s case very closely and our Consular Services team has been in frequent, direct contact with Martha since her arrest.\u201dThe arrest came as Zimbabwe\u2019s government, which last month established a cybersecurity ministry, is tightening its control over social media and its potential threat to Mr. Mugabe\u2019s 37-year rule.The crackdown has helped keep the nation\u2019s streets quiet this year. But as Mr. Mugabe prepares to run for another term, Ms. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s arrest indicates that the authorities are unlikely to tolerate even the slightest criticism of the aging leader.In an apparent display of strength, Mr. Mugabe had the airport in Harare, the nation\u2019s biggest, renamed for him on Thursday.In September, government officials described social media as a security threat, after false rumors about shortages in the nation\u2019s supermarkets caused panic buying and a spike in prices.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s longtime finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, was appointed the new cybersecurity minister last month. It is not known where \u2014 or whether \u2014 the ministry has a physical office.An earlier version of this article misidentified an anonymous web browser.

But, yes, pricing was a challenge: How to put a monetary value on provenance this rich?Supported byEAST HAMPTON, N.Y. \u2014 Grey Gardens gave up the last of its ghosts over the weekend.The once-squalid home of the most notorious mother-daughter dyad since Tennessee Williams poured his own family into \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d went into contract last month, and its contents were unloaded in a three-day estate sale.Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale and her only daughter, Edith Bouvier Beale, aunt and cousin to Jacqueline Kennedy and otherwise known as Big and Little Edie, spent half a century there enveloped in gothic scurf, attended by an army of cats and raccoons, and surrounded by the decaying accouterments of the social class from which they had exiled themselves.Their cloister was lovingly, appallingly captured by Albert and David Maysles, the cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 filmmakers whose 1975 documentary about them became a cult classic. Afterward, Little Edie, with her upside-down outfits, florid, looping drawl and na\u00eff-savant proclamations, emerged as a campy philosopher and gay idol.Grey Gardens as an idea \u2014 of the tenderness between monster mothers and thwarted daughters; of atmospheric decay and upper-class fetishism; of plucky \u00e9lan and gorgeous optimism \u2014 has waxed and waned over the years, gaining or leaking fuel as the times decried.The musical\u2019s merits and flaws were being discussed with vigor and scholarship early on the morning of November 17, when devout fans had begun to line up in the predawn hours. They were there for mementos, to be sure, but more urgently to walk in the Beales\u2019 footsteps.\u201cYou should watch the HBO film before the documentary,\u201d said Rob Younkers, 39, a fashion designer, stomping his feet in the cold and rubbing gloved hands together. \u201cTo ease you in, so you know what you\u2019re in for.\u201d Mr. Younkers, who said he\u2019d seen the documentary 400 times, had flown in from Los Angeles with his partner, Joe Zee, 48, a fashion editor and producer formerly of Elle magazine.\u201cI\u2019m the supportive spouse,\u201d Mr. Zee said. \u201cHe\u2019s the superfan.\u201dMr. Younkers, whose blue baseball cap was pinned at the brim with a Little Edie brooch, recalled how on one of their first dates, Mr. Zee drove him by Grey Gardens, and when Mr. Zee photographed Kristen Wiig there, in a story for Elle in 2014, he brought Mr. Younkers as a surprise. \u201cWe enacted the flag dance,\u201d Mr. Younkers said. \u201cIt was chilling.\u201dBehind him, Scotty Vanhoozier, 43, an I.T. specialist from Charlotte, N.C., showed off photographs of his license plate, stored on his phone, which reads, \u201cSTAUNCH,\u201d a piquant Little Edie-ism; the Big and Little Edie dolls he\u2019d had commissioned; and the many contemporary Beale portraits he\u2019d bought over the years. The sale and this visit was a bucket-list item for him, said his partner, Ben Collins, 56. \u201cI\u2019m married to an obsessive collector,\u201d he said\u201cWe have the last letter Edie wrote,\u201d Mr. Vanhoozier said, bought on eBay for $350. \u201cShe\u2019s writing a friend about the sale of the house.\u201dMr. Younkers said, \u201cDon\u2019t you just love her handwriting?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Mr. Vanhoozier said.Mr. Zee grinned at Mr. Vanhoozier. \u201cYou definitely win superfan,\u201d he said.When Ms. Quinn bought the house in 1979, she promised Little Edie that she wouldn\u2019t tear it down. Big Edie had died in 1977, and would-be buyers all wanted to raze the place. \u201cAll it needs is a coat of paint,\u201d Little Edie told her airily. The price tag was $220,000.Mr. Bradlee, who was allergic to cats, was horrified by the house\u2019s deep feline funk and its decrepitude, as were their friends. Carl Bernstein bet $100 they wouldn\u2019t be able to make the place habitable by the next summer. \u201cHe had to pay up,\u201d Ms. Quinn said.Grey Gardens tourists never stopped stalking the place.\u201cSomeone was always ringing the doorbell,\u201d Ms. Quinn said. \u201cBen, much to my dismay, was always very welcoming. One day I was sitting in the sunroom, and he walks in with this couple. \u2018This is Sven and Ingrid from Finland.\u2019 I thought maybe he knew them. But he says, \u2018They\u2019ve come all the way from Finland and asked if they could have a tour.\u2019 I had to read him the riot act afterward.\u201dJohn Perry-Miller, 18, a high school senior in Dallas, had flown up the night before so as to be on the line by 7 a.m. (The doors would open at 10.) He had an interview at American University in Washington, D.C., the next day, and was hoping to make a flight out of Islip by 1 p.m.\u201cThey really lived on their own terms,\u201d Mr. Perry-Miller said of the Beales. \u201cI think they\u2019re incredible role models. Their discourse, their arguments, always ended in mutual respect. They lived in the moment, which is a good thing and a bad thing. As Little Edie said, \u2018It\u2019s very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present.\u2019\u201d\u201cMy parents said: \u2018When are you ever going to get a chance to see Grey Gardens?\u2019\u201dTom Preston, an antiques dealer from Washington, D.C., said, \u201cI consider it a cautionary tale and love story. They were mentally ill, but they were happy.\u201dMr. Preston and David Bell, both 51, had arrived at 4 a.m., hoping to beat a crowd that didn\u2019t materialize until well past dawn. They had bonded with two other early birds, Astrelle Johnquest, 36, a gallerist, and Josh Klinghoffer, 38, the guitarist from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who had flown in from Los Angeles. They had arrived at 5:15, with a bag of snacks and fresh coffee they shared with Mr. Bell and Mr. Preston. \u201cThere is something kind of sacred here,\u201d Mr. Bell said. \u201cYou feel bad taking things away.\u201dMr. Klinghoffer said, \u201cBut we\u2019ll give them a reverent shrine.\u201d\u201cPeople were buying pebbles,\u201d Ms. Wexler said. \u201cEveryone wanted a piece of him.\u201dMs. Quinn had restored most of the Beale-era items, which came with the house. Wooden and wicker furniture had been repainted; sofas and chairs reupholstered. Original pieces were marked with a gold star on their tags, which were stamped with Ms. Wexler\u2019s logo and tied with twine. It had taken her three weeks to clear, catalog and stage the house. It shone on this chilly morning; the pale winter sun poured into the rooms.Built in 1897, the airy Arts and Crafts style-house bears little resemblance to the gloomy fortress seen in the documentary, when the privet loomed like a green tidal wave. The stairs, however, were unmistakable. At the base sat a porcelain vase Ms. Wexler had filled with American flags.By 9 a.m., there were about 50 people lining the driveway, shivering but cheerful despite the cold. Security guards handed out pale blue construction booties. Ms. Wexler\u2019s crew capped the crowd inside at 40; as the checkout line swelled and slowed to a crawl, fewer folks were allowed in. By midday, those on the growing line outside had become restive. There were calls for blankets, and an elderly man nearly fainted.Alex Rosenfield, 31, scored the scratched berg\u00e8re chair, though he almost lost it on the staircase when he skipped a step in his eagerness and dropped it. An estate manager from New York City grabbed the ladder-back chair. He was beaming. \u201cSomeone else had their hand on it, too,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they released it without a fuss. Everyone is civil.\u201dMr. Younkers had secured the curio cabinet and all its contents, 58 items, for a total of $1,051. \u201cMy heart is racing,\u201d he said.Mr. Vanhoozier was more subdued. \u201cI got this box and an oil lamp,\u201d he said ruefully. \u201cAnd everybody got everything else, though Rob said he was going to be nice and give me something from the cabinet.\u201dNot everyone was there for Beale-abilia. Bill and Carol Snee bought a few Revere Ware saucepans for under $10. Their son, they said, had lately learned to cook and had ruined more than a few pans in their collection, they said, so they\u2019ve been replenishing at local tag sales. Mr. Snee shook his head: \u201cI had to go to Grey Gardens to buy Revere Ware.\u201dMr. Perry-Miller bought a pair of Adirondack chairs ($295 each); an original slipcovered armchair ($350), and a set of plastic cups printed with the words \u201cGrey Gardens\u201d ($25). While waiting in line to pay, he did miss his flight, but was sanguine about the setback. \u201cIt was well worth it for those extra minutes at the sale,\u201d he said later. \u201cI felt like I got to really take my time and have my moment with the house that has meant so much to me for most of my life.\u201dHe said his college interview seemed to go well, too.Back in Los Angeles, Mr. Klinghoffer was also feeling philosophical. What made him fly across the country for an estate sale? he asked himself. He had bought iron garden furniture, and Mr. Bradlee\u2019s desk ($675); Ms. Johnquest bought a Victorian wicker rocking chair ($395).Grey Gardens, he wrote in text to me, was \u201can amazing study in potential and expectation. Living a certain way, or not. The notion of fame, infamy, happiness and misery. All of it. It\u2019s all there in this story. Glory, heartbreak, love, sickness. It\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s life.\u201dLittle Edie died in 2002. She was 84 and living alone in a small apartment in Bal Harbour, Fla.For his part, Mr. Younkers was overwhelmed by his get: the curio cabinet and all its tiny figures. He had worried that if the pieces were sold separately, \u201cit would be as if a little family had been torn apart.\u201dFriday evening, he and Mr. Zee came back to pick up their purchases. The sun had set, and Ms. Wexler and her crew had turned off all the lights save one in the living room, an iron, Beale-era standing lamp with a pleated shade that Mr. Younkers had also bought ($175). In a tour of the gardens, he had found a single blooming pink rose and clipped it \u2014 with permission, he said.Armed with this final memento, Mr. Younkers unplugged his lamp, and the room went dark.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Energy Idea for Mars Yields a Clue for Powering Data Centers", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 As a scientist working for NASA in the 1990s, K. R. Sridhar developed a contraption that could use energy from the sun to transform the elements of the Martian atmosphere into breathable air or propulsion fuel.It passed all its tests, but a planned mission to send it to Mars in 2001 was canceled and Dr. Sridhar moved on, looking to apply what he had learned to help stem climate change on earth instead.\u201cI came full circle \u2014 I was trying to make a really uninhabitable planet habitable,\u201d Dr. Sridhar, 56, said recently, holding a black-domed prototype of the shelved device at his Silicon Valley office. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018I can do something to make this planet a little more sustainable.\u2019 \u201dAlmost two decades later, that thought has led to a fleet of fuel-cell generators that produce electricity through a chemical reaction. And with a recent deal for Dr. Sridhar\u2019s company, Bloom Energy, to install generators at a dozen data centers in California and New Jersey for Equinix, a leading operator, it is poised for a major expansion.The aim of the deal, financed by a subsidiary of a deep-pocketed electric utility, Southern Company, is not only to create a reliable energy source for a power-thirsty industry, but also to help validate a technology that has struggled to gain mainstream acceptance.What is striking is that the fuel cells are not running on hydrogen, like the ones long seen as a promising power source for cars. Instead, they use natural gas, which has become plentiful after a production boom over the last decade.Even though they consume fossil fuels, the gas-powered cells have attracted the attention of some environment-minded policymakers, investors and entrepreneurs because they release less of the heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide than conventional plants. And they have been slowly finding fans among energy-conscious corporations \u2014 in Walmart stores, eBay data centers and Morgan Stanley\u2019s corporate headquarters.Scott Samuelsen, director of the National Fuel Cell Research Center at the University of California, Irvine, said data centers could become an important market for fuel cells because the industry \u201cappears to want to be more environmentally sensitive but more reliant on their own resources.\u201dPart of the environmental appeal lies in their efficiency. Fuel cells are generally installed on site, so they do not need to burn extra fuel to compensate for energy lost over long transmission lines. In addition, they use less fuel per watt of power than conventional plants because they don\u2019t burn fuels to heat water or air to spin turbines.That also makes them quiet, which has proved a surprising barrier to their acceptance among potential customers, Professor Samuelsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for anyone to believe that they\u2019re making any power,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a jet engine.\u201dThe innovations at Bloom stem from Dr. Sridhar\u2019s work on NASA\u2019s Mars exploration program when he was director of the Space Technologies Laboratory at the University of Arizona. Trained as a mechanical engineer in his native India, Dr. Sridhar arrived at the lab after getting a doctorate at the University of Illinois.On the Mars project, he focused on using electricity to fuel chemical reactions among elements found on the Red Planet, even creating dirt capable of germinating a seed. Figuring that he should be able to reverse the process, he founded Bloom and worked on converting chemical energy to electricity using readily available fuels and conductors.Eventually, he and his team hit upon a version of the current design of roughly 5-inch-square fuel cells fused together in stacks \u2014 each about the size of a half-loaf of bread and capable of powering an average home. The stacks are loaded into tubular metal casings before being enclosed in banks about the size of a refrigerator that can then be arrayed on the ground or a roof to run large facilities.The equipment, produced at the company headquarters here with final assembly at a factory in Delaware, is simultaneously high- and low-tech. Each cell is made from a thin ceramic wafer that is mainly zirconia \u2014 a relative of the diamond substitute. In a process reminiscent of high school art class, the wafers are screen printed with chemical inks on each side in an automated sequence and then fired in kilns. They are sandwiched between metal plates, and the resulting structure is a solid oxide fuel cell that can operate at very high temperatures, about 800 degrees Celsius, or 1,472 degrees Fahrenheit.At that temperature, when natural gas mixed with steam flows over one surface of the cell while oxygen flows over the other, a reaction results in the release of electricity, steam that is recycled through the process and carbon dioxide.Equinix tested the Bloom cells at a data center in San Jose for 18 months before committing to the current arrangement, in which it will buy the energy under a 15-year power purchase agreement. The company, which runs more than 185 data centers on five continents, serves as a kind of cloud and network broker. It builds and operates facilities that provide space, power and cooling as well as work rooms, showers and a security system featuring a series of locked chambers like something out of \u201cGet Smart.\u201d The client companies bring their own servers and other hardware to plug into more than 1,000 networks that connect them to customers and to each other.The Southern Company, based in Atlanta, comes into the partnership because it has unregulated businesses that sell power nationwide. In this case, Southern buys the fuel-cell generators from Bloom and then, through a subsidiary called PowerSecure, sells the output to Equinix under a 15-year agreement.The Bloom deal with Equinix and Southern is among the largest ever for a fuel-cell business, but Bloom faces competition from other providers, like Fuel Cell Energy, which is based in Danbury, Conn., and has a partnership with Exxon Mobil. It has won a number of recent contracts, which include installing and operating three fuel-cell projects for the Long Island Power Authority and one that will supply power for the Navy submarine base in Groton, Conn.Indeed, the United States government has had a hand in the technology\u2019s development through grant programs at the Energy Department and a federal tax credit that expired at the end of last year.The natural-gas fuel cells provide some environmental advantages over traditional power plants that run on fossil fuels: They use little water and release almost no harmful smog emissions. The Bloom cells can also run on biogas or hydrogen, which would make them even more environmentally friendly, given a steady supply of those fuels.The usefulness of natural-gas fuel cells in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a matter of some debate, however. Some environmentalists and public-utility officials say the fuel cells\u2019 emissions may be understated and question whether their carbon reductions are sufficient to warrant public subsidies.Still, their emissions are well below the average for coal-fired plants. Bloom puts the emissions of its natural-gas cells in the range of 679 to 833 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour, while coal plants released 2,252 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour in the second quarter of this year, according to the Power Sector Carbon Index, an analysis published by the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University. They are much closer to those of natural-gas plants, which, according to the index, averaged 938 pounds per megawatt-hour during the same period.Though companies looking to power energy-hungry data centers have often sought out hydroelectric power, which does not depend on fossil fuels and is generally inexpensive, fuel-cell technology is gaining traction, especially for customers who need an extremely steady power supply even during storms. For Tom Fanning, chief executive of Southern Company, the partnership with Bloom is part of a bid to take advantage of the technological advances that are upending the electric industry by allowing customers to make their own power, known as distributed generation.\u201cFor 100 years, we have had a business model predicated on the notion of making, moving and selling electricity, essentially up to a meter,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe started seeing this make-move-and-sell model moving to the customer premises. And so we decided to become involved in this space.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Shop Smart on Black Friday (and Cyber Monday)", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLong before your Thanksgiving dinner has settled, retailers start to lure you in on Black Friday and Cyber Monday with doorbuster sales and in-store discounts.Online stores have already begun \u201cleaking\u201d their big \u2014 and now weeklong \u2014 Cyber Monday sales.Whether you plan to get in line or shop from home, here are some ways to beat the marketing madness and be a smart shopper.It\u2019s hard not to get caught up in the retail frenzy, even if you don\u2019t want to. The ads are everywhere, everyone is talking about deals and it seems like everyone has something on sale.On the surface, it seems appealing: You get an early start on holiday shopping and you save some money, too. If that refrain sounds familiar \u2014 like you fell for it last year \u2014 do a little homework now to save yourself both temptation and money later.If you want a specific item, check its price today at multiple stores. Add those items to a wishlist or your shopping cart (and then abandon the cart) so you can see how much the prices change between now and Cyber Monday. This helps reveal exactly how big a discount that sale price really is.Retailers often offer deep discounts on limited quantities or specific product models in order to lure in buyers. Making a list in advance avoids the old \u201cthis is close enough\u201d rationalization, and it\u2019ll keep you from buying something you didn\u2019t really want just because it was on sale.\u201cMake sure you note the correct model number, since sometimes during the holidays, retailers will feature products that look almost identical but might have completely different features than you\u2019re expecting,\u201d Mr. Burakowski said.But do retailers mark up items just to slash their prices on Black Friday?Aside from using wish lists to track prices, there are tools for your smartphone or computer that can help make sure you\u2019re actually getting a bargain.The downside to tools like these is that they require extensive information about where you\u2019re shopping and what you\u2019re buying in order to work. Similarly, many of them get a cut of your total when you place an order with an online retailer. Neither approach is insidious, but you should be aware of both before you use them.When asked if you should jump on deals as soon as you see them, Mr. Burakowski said there\u2019s no need to. \u201cLast year, we saw a tremendous growth in retailers starting their deals Thursday \u2014 as in, we posted almost as many deals Thursday as we did Friday, and a similar amount on Monday,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the Monday ones were repeats of the ones featured across Thursday and Friday, so you may get another chance to score some of those deals you missed out on.\u201dMr. McAllister agreed. \u201cSome Black Friday deals are already going live, and almost all of them will be available on or before Thanksgiving day,\u201d he said. A lot of those will remain available through the weekend, and bleed into the deals advertised as part of Cyber Monday, which will mostly go live on Sunday, because these terms are effectively meaningless at this point. Internally, we just refer to the whole thing as Deals Week.\u201dJust keep an eye on stock levels. Only jump if you\u2019re worried something will be so popular it\u2019ll sell out.Shopping online in your pajamas is certainly more comfortable than sitting in the cold waiting for a store to open. Mr. Burakowski said that if your impulse is to stay home, follow it.\u201cI\u2019ve never liked lining up overnight and don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it in 99 percent of cases, unless you\u2019ve got a very specific product in mind that has extremely limited quantities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile everything you see offline will be available online, it can be a lot more difficult to get one of the truly rare deals online than if you\u2019re first in line and guaranteed to get it.\u201d\u201cThe only place you should line up on Thanksgiving afternoon is on the line of scrimmage for a family football game,\u201d Mr. McAllister said. \u201cBasically every deal you can get in stores will be available online, and usually matched by multiple other retailers. There are still a handful of doorbusters that are really and truly brick-and-mortar only, but they\u2019re typically low-quality products that you should probably avoid anyway.\u201dFor some, lining up for Black Friday deals is tradition, or a way to spend the day after Thanksgiving getting into the holiday shopping spirit. If getting the best deals and saving money is your goal, it\u2019s not worth it.Keep an eye on your credit and bank statements for fraudulent charges, avoid signing up for high-interest store cards or giving out too much personal information, and use strong passwords when shopping and banking online.Similarly, take steps to protect yourself from online shopping scams and bait-and-switch listings.Shop from reputable sellers and retailers \u2014 and that includes on sites like Amazon, which allow third-parties to list products for sale.Mr. Burakowski noted: \u201cI\u2019d advise shoppers to be extra careful about third party listings on some of the major sites like Amazon. We\u2019ve been seeing a fair few more scam listings, dramatically below the street price of the item from sellers with zero feedback that somehow can become the featured seller.\u201d This rule also applies to sites like eBay, Jet, Shopify and eBid.The best thing you can do is just be patient. Sometimes the best deals are yet to come, and you\u2019ll find them later in the season, on your own schedule, from a retailer you trust. Do your homework and keep a cool head, and you\u2019ll be happier for it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fanatics, Maker of Sports Apparel, Thrives by Seizing the Moment", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCONSHOHOCKEN, Pa. \u2014 This fall, as some of the N.F.L.\u2019s corporate partners fretted about the league\u2019s handling of its players kneeling during the national anthem, the sports merchandise company Fanatics pounced.When Alejandro Villanueva, a Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman, stood for the anthem and the rest of the team stayed in the locker room, his name began trending on Twitter. Fanatics quickly posted a rendering of his No. 78 jersey on its website and on the N.F.L.\u2019s online shop, which it also operates.Sales skyrocketed. Manufacturing facilities in Kentucky and Florida went to work pressing Mr. Villanueva\u2019s name and number onto thousands of blank Pittsburgh jerseys for next-day shipping. Overnight, a player who had never caught a pass or scored a touchdown had the N.F.L.\u2019s best-selling jersey.\u201cThat moment happened, people wanted to immediately buy that jersey,\u201d Michael Rubin, the company\u2019s chairman and principal owner said. \u201cA week later, that moment is mostly over.\u201dThese micro-moments, as Mr. Rubin calls them, happen all the time in sports: A player reaches a milestone, has a breakout performance or is traded to a new team. Apparel companies have traditionally been poorly positioned to meet the accompanying fan demand as it surges. Fanatics is changing that and, in the process, carving out a lucrative niche in a fiercely competitive online-retail industry largely dominated by Amazon.Fanatics has licensing rights with the North America\u2019s four major sports leagues, more than 500 colleges, Nascar, Major League Soccer and the Professional Golf Association. The company is similar to fast-fashion retailers like H&M, Uniqlo and Zara, integrating design and manufacturing with distribution to fulfill orders within hours. After the Chicago Cubs won the World Series last year, Fanatics used Uber to deliver championship gear to some fans within minutes.As a result, Fanatics has more than doubled its revenue in just a few years. It expects to take in $2 billion in 2017, and to ship more than 10 million items from Nov. 27, Cyber Monday, to Christmas, at a rate of 40,000 packages an hour, its busiest holiday retail season to date.The strategy has attracted a $1 billion investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. The Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has also taken a stake.\u201cIf you\u2019re selling the same merchandise that\u2019s commonly available, and you\u2019ve got no point of differentiation, you\u2019re dead,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of when you die.\u201dMr. Rubin said that his company\u2019s licensing deals, which run from 13 to 17 years long with each of the four major professional sports leagues, are exclusive enough that \u201csomebody can\u2019t be a significant player without the rights that we possess.\u201dAmazon sells and ships team-branded products from some licensed vendors and through its third-party marketplace. For now at least, Mr. Rubin sounds like he does not see that as much of a threat.\u201cAmazon is an incredible company,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have 5,000 full-time employees that go to bed and wake up thinking about the licensed sports business.\u201dMr. Rubin, 45, got into the industry as a 12-year-old selling ski equipment out of his parents\u2019 basement in nearby Lafayette Hill.He attended Villanova University for one semester before dropping out to start a business that handled online sales and fulfillment for big-box retailers just as the e-commerce wave was beginning. He sold the company, G.S.I. Commerce, to eBay for $2.4 billion in 2011, not long after he became a part-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers. (He also owns a stake in the New Jersey Devils.)Among G.S.I.\u2019s properties was Fanatics, which had started in 1995 as a single brick-and-mortar store in a mall in Jacksonville, Fla. Mr. Rubin liked the business so much that he bought it and two other consumer-oriented properties back from eBay, combining them into a company called Kynetic.\u201cWe sold the company on a Friday and we were at work again on Monday morning,\u201d Saj Cherian, Mr. Rubin\u2019s chief of staff, said during an interview at the company\u2019s offices in this Philadelphia suburb on a recent afternoon.\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Rubin interjected, \u201cI was at work Saturday morning.\u201dThe industry that fuels Mr. Rubin\u2019s enthusiasm is substantial. According to the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers Association, global retail sales of licensed sports merchandise reached $25 billion in 2016. The largest portion of that, 28.1 percent, was apparel.But after a jersey and T-shirt craze in the 1990s, demand flattened. Leagues parceled out their most precious licenses to brands like Nike and Adidas, which mostly seemed concerned with using on-field uniforms as marketing tools, rather than with producing gear for fans.At that point, Mr. Rubin said, the licensed sports merchandise market was \u201ca very sleepy business\u201d without a robust online presence. The leagues were doing more to reach fans directly in areas like ticketing and social media, he said, but lagging when it came to selling goods.Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, agreed.\u201cThe industry needed to be disrupted,\u201d Mr. Kraft said. Referring to Mr. Rubin, he said: \u201cHe\u2019s brought tech, innovation and a vertical on-demand model that\u2019s brought agility to an industry that hadn\u2019t changed much in decades.\u201dAmong the micro-moments that highlighted the new need for speed was Jeremy Lin\u2019s emergence as a sudden star for the New York Knicks in 2012 amid the so-called Linsanity phenomenon.\u201cWhen Linsanity happened, within 12 hours to 24 hours, there were no jerseys to get,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cSo you had this huge demand, and there\u2019s no jerseys available. Then you order them like crazy, and by the time they get in, the moment\u2019s over.\u201dSal LaRocca, the N.B.A.\u2019s president of global partnerships, said the episode \u201cwas a large catalyst in moving to where we ultimately moved to with Fanatics.\u201d The N.B.A. entered an initial partnership with the company in 2015 to run the N.B.A. store; Fanatics acquired the rights to sell replica jerseys beginning this season.In 2013, Mr. Rubin moved most of Fanatics\u2019 executive team to Silicon Valley from Florida and started a team dedicated to mobile platforms. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get the type of talent we needed in the speed we needed in Jacksonville,\u201d he said.This year, the company will spend $120 million to improve the customer experience, its data acquisition efforts, its communications with manufacturers and the Fanatics app.The investment is critical, Mr. Rubin said, given that 90 percent of the company\u2019s business is online, and more than 50 percent comes through mobile devices. Fanatics declined to disclose sales figures, but said that about a quarter of its sales have traditionally come in December. This year, it expects 70 million unique visitors to its websites, including more than 300 online team stores, for the month.Major League Baseball said sales of Fanatics products on MLBShop.com were up 67 percent this year, thanks in part to the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on hot-market items.\u201cIt\u2019s an untapped market that we\u2019ve all been missing,\u201d said Noah Garden, M.L.B.\u2019s executive vice president of business.Fanatics\u2019 only ties to brick-and-mortar retailing are the roughly 30 team or league outlets operates in arenas and stadiums. Mr. Rubin envisions the arena stores complementing the online operation, with fans at games using their phones to order goods, and then having the items delivered directly to their seats.Sports is particularly well suited to online retail, with many fans living far from their favorite teams\u2019 hometowns. But Fanatics\u2019 success depends in part on its deals with the leagues, which could create competition by entering agreements with rivals.\u201cWhile I have a lot of admiration for what Fanatics has done, what they\u2019re doing is replicable,\u201d said Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at the market research firm NPD Group.The company is not waiting for that to happen. Doug Mack, the Fanatics\u2019 chief executive, said it wanted to expand globally, and had already acquired rights to sell merchandise from nearly a dozen English Premier League teams, including Manchester United and Everton.Mr. Rubin said he thought Fanatics could be a $10 billion company in 10 years, with half of its business coming from beyond North America.At that size, it would surpass Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and Under Armour, even if sports fans might not realize who was responsible for that must-have Tom Brady jersey.\u201cThey probably don\u2019t know it now,\u201d Mr. Kraft, the Patriots owner, said. \u201cBut they will.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified one of the English Premier League teams that has a licensing deal with Fanatics, the sports merchandise company. It is Everton, not Chelsea.An earlier version of this article misidentified the operator of the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 website. It is the team itself, not the sports apparel maker Fanatics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Defiant Map-Hunter Stakes Vietnam\u2019s Claims in the South China Sea", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThey always say to me, \u2018Mr. Son, please keep calm,\u2019\u201d he said during an interview at his home in Danang, the coastal city where he is the deputy director of a state-run research institute. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t talk badly about China.\u2019\u201dVietnam\u2019s top leaders are \u201cslaves\u201d to Beijing, he added bitterly, as torrential rain beat against his windows. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have many documents that are kept in the dark.\u201dChina\u2019s assertiveness in the sea has caused deep anxiety for Vietnam, which regards territorial sovereignty as a sacred principle, and emboldened the government to promote claims over the disputed Spratly and Paracel archipelagos more aggressively.But he said the recent surge of nationalism over China\u2019s expansive vision raises a thorny question: \u201cHow do you position yourself as defending Vietnam from China when China is basically your backbone?\u201dInterest in territorial sovereignty has long been \u201cin the heart\u201d of the Vietnamese people, said a senior Vietnamese legal expert in Hanoi, who insisted on anonymity to discuss a sensitive political matter. But the oil rig crisis has greatly magnified the interest.China has controlled the Paracels since 1974, when it seized them from the former government of South Vietnam in a naval clash. It has bolstered its foothold in the Spratlys recently through an island-building campaign.But some in Vietnam, like Dr. Son, are trying to marshal their own historical records \u2014 even if they may have little power to dissuade China.Dr. Son, 50, and other Vietnamese scholars say the Nguyen dynasty, which ruled present-day Vietnam from 1802 to 1945, wielded clear administrative control over the Paracels by sending survey parties and even planting trees on them as a warning against shipwrecks. This happened decades before imperial or post-revolutionary China showed any interest in the islands, they say.\u201cThe Chinese know very clearly they never mentioned the Hoang Sa or the Truong Sa in their history books or historical maps,\u201d Dr. Son said, using the Vietnamese terms for the Paracels and Spratlys.By contrast, he said, he found evidence in more than 50 books \u2014 in English, French, Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese \u2014 that a Nguyen-era Vietnamese explorer planted the royal flag in the Paracels in the 1850s.International arbitration over territorial sovereignty can only proceed if both parties agree, analysts say, and China has shown no interest in that.Still, the frenzy of interest in Vietnam\u2019s maritime history since about 2012 has produced a buzz in the state-run news media \u2014 and a few unexpected heroes.One is Tran Thang, a Vietnamese-American mechanical engineer who lives in Connecticut. He said by telephone that he had donated 153 maps and atlases to the Danang government in 2012 after ordering them on eBay for about $30,000.China has been feverishly piling sand onto reefs in the South China Sea for the past year, creating seven new islets in the region. It is straining geopolitical tensions that were already taut.Among Vietnamese academics who study the government\u2019s territorial claims in what it calls the East Vietnam Sea, Dr. Son is among the most prominent.He was born in 1967 in Hue, about 50 miles northwest of Danang, and his father was killed in 1970 while fighting for South Vietnam. \u201cI only remember the funeral,\u201d he said.As a student poking around dusty archives, Dr. Son said, he would photocopy maps that highlighted Vietnamese territorial claims in the South China Sea. So when top officials in Danang asked him in 2009 to pursue the same research on the government\u2019s behalf, he said, he leapt at the chance.\u201cI\u2019m always against the Chinese,\u201d he said by way of explanation. Chinese scholars have been conducting rival research for years with support from Beijing, he added, and he sees his own work as payback.Danang officials allowed Dr. Son to recruit a seven-member support team, he said, but did not fund his international travel. He said he paid for some of the research that he has conducted since 2013 across Europe and the United States, where he was a Fulbright scholar at Yale University, out of pocket.Dr. Son, the deputy director at the Danang Institute for Socio-Economic Development, said he still held out hope that Vietnam would take China to court.But he also said he was not holding his breath and had little say in the outcome.\u201cI\u2019m not political,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m a scientist.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Revolution at Etsy", "Date": "2017-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe first time Josh Silverman addressed the staff of Etsy as their newly installed chief executive, he tried to connect with a work force known for its diversity, idealism and sincerity.\u201cHello,\u201d he said. \u201cMy name is Josh. I identify as male. My preferred pronouns are \u2018him\u2019 and \u2018he.\u2019 Most people just call me Josh.\u201dIt was May 3, and Mr. Silverman was speaking to a roomful of traumatized employees. The day before, Etsy had fired 80 people, the first big layoffs at the online marketplace for handmade and vintage arts and crafts. Among those ousted was Etsy\u2019s beloved chief executive of six years, Chad Dickerson.Now Mr. Silverman \u2014 an Etsy board member but an unknown to most employees \u2014 stood in the Etsytorium, trying to win over a hostile crowd. His earnest introduction was an olive branch of sorts, an effort to signal that he was attuned to Etsy\u2019s vibrant gay and transgender community, and would be respectful of the company\u2019s distinctive culture. But to many in attendance, his remarks came off as tone deaf, and his inability to read the room foreshadowed sweeping changes that would soon transform Etsy.On the same day as the chief executive changeover, the company announced its first layoffs. Within weeks of assuming control, Mr. Silverman shut down several projects that had been in the works for months. Not long after that, he fired another 140 employees.It was a dizzying series of events at a company that has long held itself up as a paragon of righteous business practices. Etsy\u2019s founders believed its business model \u2014 helping mostly female entrepreneurs make a living online \u2014 was inherently just. Employees shared their emotions freely, often crying at the office. Perks included generous paid parental leave, free organic food and a pet-friendly workplace. Etsy was certified as a B Corp by a nonprofit called B Lab, denoting its particularly high social and environmental standards.But once Etsy went public in 2015, it was evaluated just like any other company traded on the stock market. By late last year, expenses were growing fast. And even as the company reported $88 million in revenues during the third quarter, it posted a net loss of $2.5 million. After a few quarters of tepid results, investors grew impatient and a classic clash of corporate governance came spilling into view \u2014 how would a company like Etsy balance the short-term demands of its shareholders with its high-minded long-term mission?By some important metrics, Etsy appears to be improving under Mr. Silverman\u2019s leadership. Revenues are up, as are \u201cgross merchandise sales\u201d \u2014 the total value of goods being sold on Etsy. The company\u2019s stock has risen about 50 percent in the six months since he took over.By other measures, however, Etsy is barely recognizable. The \u201cValues-Aligned Business\u201d team, which oversaw the company\u2019s social and environmental efforts, was dismantled. A new focus on profitability has sapped many employees of their enthusiasm. A workplace that once encouraged workers to express their feelings has clammed up. Etsy is no longer a B Corp.Today, as Mr. Silverman continues to push for change and investors keep close watch on the stock, what\u2019s most frustrating to some close observers of the company is that Etsy seems to have given up so much to gain so little.As Etsy grew, it eschewed traditional corporate customs in favor of a more freewheeling approach. Building consensus was more important than moving fast. Employees believed Etsy could be equally beneficial to buyers, sellers, staff and the planet. The idealism was infectious, and many people turned down higher salaries from other companies to work for Etsy.Yet for all its efforts to stand apart, Etsy followed the established playbook when it came to financing its growth. Venture capitalists poured some $85 million into the company, making a takeover or initial public offering all but inevitable.In 2011, the board decided to replace Mr. Kalin with Mr. Dickerson, who was then the chief technology officer. As C.E.O., Mr. Dickerson oversaw dramatic growth. When he took Etsy public in 2015, the company had 1.4 million active sellers, nearly 20 million buyers and had gross merchandise sales of $2 billion a year.True to form, Etsy found ways to make its initial public offering inclusive. It marketed shares to small investors and Etsy sellers and tried to concentrate shares in a smaller than usual number of institutional holders. Besides upholding the company\u2019s egalitarian ethos, the effort had a strategic rationale. The hope was that such a shareholder base might insulate Etsy from some of the short-term pressures of the stock market.Yet even as Etsy grew to number more than 1,000 staffers, the company\u2019s unorthodox culture survived. Mr. Dickerson held weekly \u201cOffice Hours,\u201d when any employee could ask him about anything, and spoke openly about his doubts, admitting when he didn\u2019t know the answer to a question.The emotional, individualistic culture had its drawbacks. The emphasis on go-it-alone craftsmanship meant Etsy managed its own data centers, instead of using more efficient options like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. With everyone empowered to express themselves, there was a lot of sharing going on. Inboxes were stuffed with unnecessary emails, which dragged on productivity.Mr. Silverman said he came to his first board meeting prepared to listen. But in the Etsy boardroom, seated around a large custom-made table featuring gold inlay, a large owl sculpture looming over the directors, he said he was troubled by what he heard from Mr. Dickerson. Expenses were growing faster than revenues. Sales on the site were up, but the rate of growth was slowing.As Mr. Dickerson tried to move the meeting on to topics including international expansion, Mr. Silverman spoke up. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re big at all,\u201d he told the board. \u201cWe\u2019re at the early stages.\u201dMr. Silverman pressed Mr. Dickerson to get more aggressive about the rate of growth, and called for a renewed focus on increasing sales. Privately, he came away concerned about the company\u2019s trajectory. \u201cThere was not a sense of crisis,\u201d Mr. Silverman said.\u201cThe house was burning and nobody was paying attention,\u201d said Fred Wilson, the co-founder of Union Square Ventures, which was an early investor in Etsy, and the board chairman. \u201cChad got the company about as far as he was going to get it. We needed somebody to take it to the next level.\u201dInstead of the soft skills that Mr. Dickerson brought, the board wanted someone with experience in marketing, software and e-commerce, someone who was comfortable at a big public company. In other words, someone like Mr. Silverman.At 4 p.m. on Tuesday, May 2, Mr. Dickerson called an emergency meeting in the Etsytorium, a cavernous conference room inside headquarters. Usually a loose public speaker, Mr. Dickerson read from a script, his voice shaking as he made an announcement: He was laying off 80 employees \u2014 the largest cuts in Etsy\u2019s history. And, he said, he had been fired by the board.Mr. Dickerson broke into tears, and sat down to steady himself. Many in the audience openly wept.Mr. Dickerson had learned that he was being replaced only days earlier, and his termination was effective immediately. Even by the unsentimental standards of corporate America, it was an abrupt transition. That night, a large contingent went drinking at local beer garden.The next morning, Mr. Dickerson, Mr. Silverman and Mr. Wilson all addressed the company. Mr. Dickerson told the crowd he was hung over. Mr. Wilson made some perfunctory remarks. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to blame anyone for this decision, I want you to blame me,\u201d he said.Finally, Mr. Silverman took the microphone, addressing his new staff for the first time. After introducing himself (and noting his gender), Mr. Silverman spoke about his background and experience. He said he wanted to preserve what was best about Etsy and help the company grow.When he began taking questions, the room turned hostile.\u201cYesterday felt impersonal, unempathetic and decidedly un-Etsy,\u201d the first employee said, according to a recording of the meeting. \u201cWhat is the new leadership planning to do to earn our trust and maintain the empathetic and human culture that is the entire reason that many of us chose to work here?\u201d\u201cTrust is earned, not granted,\u201d Mr. Silverman replied. \u201cKeep an open mind, and we\u2019ll get to know each other.\u201dEmployees saw Mr. Dickerson one last time. The next Friday, he came back to the office to give a Last Lecture, a traditional Etsy send-off. Mr. Dickerson spoke openly about his personal life and his time with Etsy. Everybody cried.Mr. Silverman wasted no time making changes. His sole focus, he said, was speeding up the pace of sales growth.He identified 30 projects that had the best chance of boosting sales on the site. Etsy began giving buyers more assurances, telling them that it didn\u2019t share credit card information with sellers, and that the company would refund their purchases if something went wrong. It began encouraging sellers to compare prices before listing an item. And for the first time, Etsy is running sales and promoting the holidays. Each of these changes, Mr. Silverman said, resulted in modest but measurable sales increases.Not everything worked. A move to display all-inclusive pricing, instead of the cost of the good and shipping separately, hurt sales and upset sellers. And a new way of displaying search filters didn\u2019t move the needle. \u201cMore than half of the things we try don\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying things.\u201dOther projects were shut down. Etsy Studio, a new marketplace for arts and crafts supplies that had consumed significant resources, was sidelined. Plans for further international expansion were put on hold. A marketing campaign was scrapped.At the same time, Mr. Silverman began redrawing what he said was a convoluted organizational chart. Too many people were managers, he said, and too many managers had too few reports. On June 21, less than two months after taking over, Mr. Silverman announced another, larger round of layoffs.Despite the tumult, Mr. Silverman said progress was being made as small tweaks to the site began to pay off. \u201cWe subtracted people and we\u2019re getting a lot more done,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more focus, a lot more urgency.\u201dSeveral current Etsy employees said they appreciated a new sense of direction and accountability, and that the company was becoming more innovative. \u201cThe tolerance for risk has gone up significantly,\u201d said Linda Kozlowski, the chief operating officer. \u201cThere\u2019s been a cultural shift of accountability in a good way.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re doing their best to mimic eBay and Amazon,\u201d said Amy Stringer-Mowat, co-founder of American Heirloom, a Brooklyn company that makes customized bamboo cutting boards. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bite the hand that feeds you, but that\u2019s the best way to describe how I feel about what\u2019s going on.\u201dMs. Stringer-Mowat\u2019s company got started on Etsy, but she said sales on the site have slumped in recent months. She stopped hearing from Etsy employees in the marketing department who had helped her promote her business, and she said Etsy was pressuring her to offer cheaper shipping rates, which cuts into her profits.Mr. Silverman insists Etsy is still a mission-driven company. Many of the perks remain in place, and the company is lobbying in Washington, including for the protection of net neutrality. But Mr. Silverman says Etsy\u2019s greatest potential for impact is helping sellers \u2014 many of whom are women running small businesses \u2014 increase their sales. \u201cThe company had the best of intentions, but wasn\u2019t great at tying that to impact,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cBeing good doesn\u2019t cut the mustard.\u201dOn the afternoon of Nov. 6, Etsy reported strong quarterly earnings. Sales, revenues and adjusted profits were all up. In after-hours trading, Etsy shares spiked. When the markets opened the next morning, however, the stock slumped. The results, fine as they were, were not good enough.Three days later, Mr. Silverman was back in the Etsytorium, addressing his staff. The quarter was proof that changes to the company were paying off, he said, suggesting that the tumult of the past six months had not been in vain. \u201cThe quarter that we just reported, that you all worked so hard to deliver, means so much to Etsy and to all the people who rely on us,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cI\u2019m super fired up.\u201dEtsy will likely grow with Mr. Silverman as chief executive, but it may never again be the sensitive community fostered by Mr. Kalin and nurtured by Mr. Dickerson. Once a beacon of socially responsible business practices with a starry-eyed work force that believed it could fundamentally reimagine commerce, Etsy has over the past year become a case study in how the short-term pressures of the stock market can transform even the most idealistic of companies.\u201cThere\u2019s only so much wiggle room as a public company,\u201d said Mr. Stinchcomb, the early employee. \u201cIf you really want to build a company that works for people and the planet, capitalism isn\u2019t the solution.\u201dMr. Wilson, the chairman of the board, dismisses that as sentimental hooey.\u201cTo all the people who say taking Etsy public was a mistake, I say that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201c There are some people who will say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not right for me. I like the old culture.\u2019 Well, I\u2019m sorry about that. Going public was the best thing that ever happened to this company.\u201dAdvertisement"}
