{"Headline": "F.C.C. Leader Seeks Tech Companies\u2019 Views on Net Neutrality", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, met with Facebook and other tech companies this week to seek feedback on his intention to unwind aspects of net neutrality, the rules that require broadband providers to make all internet content equally accessible for consumers.Mr. Pai said on Thursday that his visits with executives at Facebook, Cisco, Oracle and Intel were constructive and that he believed the companies wanted to find \u201ccommon ground.\u201d Web companies have supported net neutrality, saying the protections guard them from paying tolls to get their content in front of consumers. Mr. Pai said that he agreed with the broad principles of net neutrality but that the rules, created by the commission in 2015, went too far in restricting broadband providers.\u201cI think they were appreciative,\u201d Mr. Pai said of the tech companies. \u201cI have been soliciting thoughts on online protections.\u201dMr. Pai said on Thursday that he wanted to overturn the declaration of broadband as a utility-like service, which puts stricter rules on broadband providers, akin to what phone services face today.Facebook and Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Pai\u2019s remarks. The Internet Association, a trade group that represents Facebook, Google and Netflix, recently met with Mr. Pai and urged him to keep the rules intact.A Cisco spokeswoman said Mr. Pai had asked the company\u2019s chief executive, Chuck Robbins, to gather some Silicon Valley leaders to discuss the future of net neutrality. The informal discussion was held at Cisco\u2019s campus in San Jose, Calif., the spokeswoman said.In a statement, Oracle said its discussion with Mr. Pai this week was broad and did not address any specific policy proposals currently under consideration. Oracle has previously said it supports Mr. Pai\u2019s agenda, and its meetings with him have included one with the company\u2019s chief executive, Safra Catz, who was on Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team.The commission\u2019s direction under Mr. Pai has alarmed consumer groups. Michael Copps, a former Democratic commissioner, said companies like AT&T and Comcast that have heavily lobbied the commission to roll back rules would directly benefit from the recent actions.\u201cThis is the price we pay for the outrageous influence of money in politics,\u201d said Mr. Copps, a special adviser to the consumer group Common Cause. \u201cThe public interest suffers, and we are poorer \u2014 economically and civically \u2014 for it.\u201dIn votes split down party lines on Thursday, Mr. Pai pushed forward a plan that will ease standards to allow telecom carriers like AT&T and CenturyLink to raise fees for small businesses, wireless carriers, hospitals and libraries to connect to the main arteries of their broadband networks. AT&T and other telecom giants had heavily lobbied for the new rule.In a dramatic reversal from the Obama administration, which was pushing for caps on pricing, Mr. Pai said telecom companies should have more freedom to set their own rates. \u201cPrice regulation threatens competition and investment,\u201d he said.The commission also approved a separate proposal easing restrictions on broadcast television corporations seeking to buy more stations. Mignon Clyburn, the Democratic commissioner, voted against the proposal and warned that greater media consolidation would give fewer companies a bigger voice.\u201cThis is industry consolidation month\u201d at the F.C.C., she said.Advertisement"}

Not coincidentally, Snapchat is also being used as a newsroom tool at The New York Times to reach new readers.Korkki continues:Isn\u2019t there any mental upside to getting older?Yes, there is, Professor Miller said.

I would have been better off getting study materials and just taking some certification tests. I\u2019m working now on a Cisco certification.\u201cMost of my field is contract work. I have to go out and get health insurance on my own, and I lost my job three times when temporary contracts ended. I\u2019m always behind; I lost my car because I couldn\u2019t pay.

I\u2019ve stopped paying on most of them. My view is, if I die, who is going to pay for the loans? I\u2019m not married. I\u2019m not tied to anyone. There\u2019s nothing they can do.\u201dRebecca Russell, 36Attended Northwest Florida State College from 2004 to 2007 and the University of West Florida from 2008 to 2011; earned a B.A. in maritime history.Artist and seasonal tourism worker in Destin, Fla.\u201cI live in a very tourism-based area where the jobs are all seasonal. I got my diploma and then immediately had no job and nowhere to live. Paying back my loans was not even an option. Two of them went straight into default. Every once in a while, around tax time, I\u2019ll get a call from a collector saying, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ll settle,\u2019 but I have no idea if it\u2019s legitimate. I just ignore those two loans.\u201cEvery year, I battle with Navient on my private loans. I say, \u2018I can\u2019t afford to pay this, I need a payment reduction,\u2019 and they push me toward forbearance. I just did this recently. My interest rate went up \u2014 no warning, no explanation \u2014 and when I called, the representative said there was nothing she could do.\u201cI said, \u2018I know there\u2019s some kind of lawsuit going on,\u2019 and she cut me off and sent me to a rate-reduction department. They took my information and got my payment down to $88. But it took 30 minutes of arguing.\u201dNick Newton, 34Attended ITT from 2004 to 2009; earned a B.A. in computer science.I.T. Specialist in New London, Wis.\u201cWhen I graduated from ITT, my payments were not manageable, and I was never offered income-based repayments. They offered me deferment, and so I used up all the deferment that was available. In the meantime, the interest was collecting and getting capitalized. I paid sporadically, when I could, but the bill was $800 or more each month. It was a huge burden.\u201cLast year, I finally got on an income-based plan. Now I pay $450. I have a good career, and I can afford the payment \u2014 but when you log on to Navient and see that you owe $121,000, it\u2019s hard to look at. That\u2019s nearly a house in this area.\u201cI have a family now; I got married Christmas Day last year, and we just had our first kid, a son. My wife is in the same position with student loans. Combined, we owe about $200,000. You keep throwing money at it every month, and the balance doesn\u2019t go down.

I wasn\u2019t ready to start my career, so I decided to get a photography degree.\u201cI had no idea what I was doing, financially. I was young, and I didn\u2019t know what it meant to take out big loans. I assumed I would get a job and be able to pay it back. The school never had any kind of serious conversation with the students about it.\u201cThe only thing they did was, right before we graduated, all the people with loans had a class where they showed us a piece of paper with loan amounts and the monthly payments on them. The highest they had listed was $90,000. I said: \u2018Wait, what? We all owe more than this.\u2019\u201cI couldn\u2019t make enough money as a photographer. It\u2019s all freelance, and smaller jobs here and there. I kept paying on my loans, but I was totally broke. At one point, I moved in with my boyfriend\u2019s parents to save money.\u201cI was on an income-based repayment plan at one point, but you have to sign back up every year. I\u2019m not on any kind of reduction plan right now. I pay $1,395 a month. I feel like I got a pointless degree \u2014 there\u2019s just no job market for it.

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Chairman Pushes Sweeping Changes to Net Neutrality Rules", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday outlined a sweeping plan to loosen the government\u2019s oversight of high-speed internet providers, a rebuke of a landmark policy approved two years ago to ensure that all online content is treated the same by the companies that deliver broadband service to Americans.The chairman, Ajit Pai, said high-speed internet service should no longer be treated like a public utility with strict rules, as it is now. The move would, in effect, largely leave the industry to police itself.The plan is Mr. Pai\u2019s most forceful action in his race to roll back rules that govern telecommunications, cable and broadcasting companies, which he says are harmful to business. But he is certain to face a contentious battle with the consumers and tech companies that rallied around the existing rules, which are meant to prevent broadband providers like AT&T and Comcast from giving special treatment to any streaming videos, news sites and other content.His plan, though still vague on the details, is a sharp change from the approach taken by the last F.C.C. administration, which approved rules governing a concept known as net neutrality in 2015. The rules were intended to ensure an open internet, meaning that no content could be blocked by broadband providers and that the internet would not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for internet and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else.In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Pai said he would undo that classification.Mr. Pai said he was generally supportive of the idea behind net neutrality but said the rules went too far and were not necessary for an open internet. He said he would also seek public comment on how to preserve the basic principles of net neutrality \u2014 the prohibitions of blocking, throttling and paid priority for online traffic.Mr. Pai voted against the current rules as a commissioner. Critics of his ideas for changing the rules warned that making any commitments only voluntary would pave the way for the creation of business practices that harm competition.\u201cIt would put consumers at the mercy of phone and cable companies,\u201d said Craig Aaron, president of the consumer advocacy group Free Press. \u201cIn a fantasy world, all would be fine with a pinkie swear not to interrupt pathways and portals to the internet despite a history of doing that.\u201dThe new policy faces several hurdles before going into effect, including months of comments and revisions. But Republicans have a 2 to 1 majority on the commission, including Mr. Pai, so most proposals he puts up for a vote will generally be expected to pass.Consumer groups and tech companies have warned of a legal challenge, however. The current net neutrality rules were affirmed by a federal appeals court, which could put an extra burden on Mr. Pai to justify his changes.The F.C.C.\u2019s policing of broadband companies has drawn greater interest with recent proposals for big mergers, such as AT&T\u2019s $85 billion bid for Time Warner, that create huge media conglomerates that distribute and own video content. Already, AT&T is giving mobile subscribers free streaming access to television content by DirecTV, which it owns. Consumer groups have complained that such practices, known as sponsored data, put rivals at a disadvantage and could help determine what news and information is most likely to reach consumers.Telecom and cable companies applauded the announcement on Wednesday. Since Mr. Pai\u2019s appointment in January by President Trump, their lobbyists have flooded the agency and the offices of Congress, pushing for an unwinding of rules that they say hamper their businesses. The No. 1 target has been the rules on broadband providers, which they complain have crimped their willingness to invest in their networks.Excerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.\u201cWe applaud F.C.C. Chairman Pai\u2019s initiative to remove this stifling regulatory cloud over the internet,\u201d Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cIt was illogical for the F.C.C. in 2015 to abandon that light-touch approach and instead regulate the internet under an 80-year-old law designed to set rates for the rotary-dial-telephone era.\u201dMr. Pai has been an active figure in the Trump administration\u2019s quest to dismantle regulations. He froze a broadband subsidy program for low-income households, eased limits on television station mergers and eased caps on how much a company like AT&T or Comcast can charge another business to get online.Consumer groups have opposed some of his changes, and they challenged the assertions of telecom companies that broadband regulations harm their businesses. They said publicly traded broadband companies have increased investments in their networks 5 percent since the current rules went into effect.About 800 tech start-ups and investors, organized by the Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator and the San Francisco policy advocacy group Engine, protested the unwinding of net neutrality in a letter sent to Mr. Pai on Wednesday.\u201cWithout net neutrality, the incumbents who provide access to the internet would be able to pick winners or losers in the market,\u201d they wrote in the letter.So far, Google and Netflix, the most vocal proponents of net neutrality in previous years, have not spoken individually about Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal. Speaking through their trade group, the Internet Association, they said the broadband and net neutrality rules should stay intact.\u201cRolling back these rules or reducing the legal sustainability of the order will result in a worse internet for consumers and less innovation online,\u201d Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, said in a statement.Mr. Pai vowed a strong commitment to the plan: \u201cMake no mistake about it: This is a fight that we intend to wage and it is a fight that we are going to win.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect location for the policy advocacy group Engine. It is based in San Francisco, not New York.Advertisement"}
