{"Headline": "Movers: Trump Bump, Time Inc. and Exxon", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byWe\u2019re following major developments in the markets throughout the day. Check below for the latest updates.In his first 100 days as president, Donald J. Trump may have found much of his agenda stymied, from a health care overhaul to a hotly contested immigration order.Many American consumers may not have heard of Synchrony Financial, but there is a good chance they have one of the company\u2019s credit cards.Synchrony issues credit cards in partnership with giant retailers like Walmart and JCPenny, which consumer use to purchase goods typically in return for discounts or other rewards.And on Friday, Synchrony\u2019s share price was getting hammered \u2014 down more than 14 percent in midmorning training.Synchrony, which was spun out of GE Capital in 2014, reported a smaller profit \u2014 61 cents a share \u2014 compared with the 74 cents that many Wall Street analysts had expected.The miss was driven partly by the company\u2019s need to reserve more money to deal with potential defaults from consumers.Investors took that as a worrisome sign that the credit quality of Synchrony\u2019s cards \u2014 which total about $70 billion \u2014 is declining faster than predicted.General Motors said on Friday that strong sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles drove a 34 percent increase in first-quarter earnings and positioned the company for a solid year ahead.The company\u2019s core North American market set a record for pretax profit, $3.4 billion, as buyers continued to flock to G.M.\u2019s truck and S.U.V. lineup.Exxon Mobil posted strong first-quarter earnings on Friday, as expected, with oil prices up by more than 50 percent from this time last year.With cash flow up and capital and exploration spending down, net income jumped to $4.01 billion from $1.81 billion in the year-ago quarter. Exxon Mobil shares, which have slumped so far this year, climbed 1 percent in morning trading.\u2022 The economy barely grew, expanding at an annual rate of only 0.7 percent.\u2022 The growth was a sharp decline from the 2.1 percent annual rate recorded in the final quarter of last year. It was the weakest quarterly showing in three years.\u2022 Consumption, the component reflecting individual spending, rose by only 0.3 percent, well below the 3.5 percent rate in the previous quarter.The economy\u2019s weakness reflected new caution among consumers. Other sectors like housing and business investment turned in a stronger showing, but not enough to offset factors like weaker retail sales.James E. Staley, the Barclays chief executive, offered another apology to investors on Friday about a \u201cmistake\u201d that led to an inquiry by British regulators into his treatment of a whistle-blower.Directors at Barclays have said they will formally reprimand Mr. Staley and make a \u201cvery significant compensation adjustment\u201d to his bonus after the inquiry.\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Mr. Staley said on a conference call with journalists on Friday. \u201cI was trying to protect a vulnerable colleague, but I should have left the organization to handle it. I\u2019ve accepted the judgment of the board. We are cooperating fully with the regulatory investigation.\u201dOn Thursday, Institutional Shareholder Services, a prominent proxy adviser, said that, because of concerns over the inquiry, investors should refrain from voting or abstain when Mr. Staley comes up for re-election to the bank\u2019s board at the annual meeting next month.The generally positive momentum for lenders in Europe in the first quarter continued on Friday as the Swiss bank UBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland reported their results.The quarterly profit was the lender\u2019s first since the third quarter of 2015. The bank has reported annual losses for the past nine years, but says it expects to be profitable in 2018.A consortium of investors led by the private equity firms Hillhouse Capital and CDH Investments have offered to buy China\u2019s Belle International in a transaction that would value the shoe retailer at $6.8 billion.That represents a premium of nearly 20 percent to the company\u2019s share price before trading was halted at the company\u2019s request on April 18.Belle has suffered as China\u2019s vast and fast-growing consumer culture changes the way it shops. Increasingly, Chinese people shop online, leading to booming business for American-traded online Chinese e-commerce firms like Alibaba Group and JD.com. But like in the United States, that shift has resulted in slower traffic at brick-and-mortar stores.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With New Funding, Didi Chuxing, an Uber Rival, Looks Beyond China", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byWhen Uber pulled out of China last summer, it appeared to be the end of two years of frenzied competition with the local rival Didi Chuxing.Yet with a new funding round that has brought in $5.5 billion, it seems the Chinese firm wants to take the rivalry global.The investment, which Didi Chuxing announced in a statement on Friday, values the company at about $50 billion, according to someone who was familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak publicly about the details. That valuation makes it the second most valuable start-up in the world, behind Uber.The new financing could bring Didi Chuxing back into competition with Uber: Analysts expect the Chinese company to use the funds to push into new markets and to develop autonomous driving technologies.The fund-raising efforts indicate just how valuable it can be to dominate China, an internet-savvy market with the world\u2019s largest smartphone-using population, which is nevertheless largely closed to foreign competition. Despite having done little outside China, Didi Chuxing has been able to raise almost as much money as Uber.With the infusion, Didi Chuxing\u2019s expansion will be watched closely as a signal of the ability of Chinese start-ups to expand beyond their home market.While Chinese internet companies have innovated at home, becoming some of the largest businesses in the world, they have a mixed track record in expanding abroad.Didi Chuxing was also expected to use part of the new funds to develop next-generation technologies. There, too, it faces stiff competition. Google, Uber and the Chinese search engine Baidu all have a lead in development of autonomous driving. In March, Didi Chuxing said it was creating an artificial-intelligence lab in Silicon Valley to help it create driverless car and security technologies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Last of New York\u2019s Master Wigmakers", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "At a time when wigs are increasingly popular, the artisans who make them by hand are a vanishing breed.Supported byNicholas Piazza keeps 600 pounds of hair in his Staten Island garage.He stores it in plastic bins and cardboard boxes, opposite the fishing supplies. \u201cGot grays, got browns, got blonds,\u201d he said. \u201cGot everything.\u201dInside one bin, shiny brown bundles nestled around one another like snakes. He picked two thick braids and lifted them from the bin. Uncoiled, they were three feet long and nearly reached the ground. \u201cThis is all Russian hair cut right off people\u2019s heads,\u201d Mr. Piazza said.Much of his hair came from this stash, sourced from around the world, and which eventually outgrew his studio. \u201cI couldn\u2019t close my closets,\u201d he said. \u201cI had more hair than I knew what to do with.\u201dMr. Piazza is one of the last Old World wigmakers making wigs for the public in the city, men and women trained mostly by Italian and Jewish immigrants in the centuries-old trade of hand-tying wigs, a fussy affair that on the patience spectrum falls somewhere between tailoring a jacket and counting the stars.\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d he said. \u201cJust coasting.\u201dThis may appear to be yet another case of an antiquated craft disappearing from New York, one artisan at a time. But wigs are far from being swept into the past. The demand, it turns out, hasn\u2019t been as high as it is now since the wig craze of the late 1960s and early \u201970s, when Mr. Piazza and his fellow wigmakers entered the field. Wigs are part of the boom in the human hair trade that began with extensions.Most of the wigs on the market, though, are made in China, where thousands of factory workers do the painstaking work that New York\u2019s wigmakers once did: plucking short and splintered hair from bundles, baking curls, stirring hair in vats of bleach, hand-knotting wigs. \u201cA lot of the people who call their wigs \u2018custom,\u2019\u201d Mr. Piazza said, \u201cthey just write up the order and send it to the Orient and then when they get it, they\u2019ll do some tweaking.\u201dOne measure of a good wig is its hairline. It\u2019s the most difficult thing to imitate, which is why a lot of wigs tend to have bangs. To achieve a naturalistic look, wigmakers stitch hair individually at the hairline, often even adding baby hair.Another mark of a superior wig is the quality of the hair. Hair of the kind Mr. Piazza has in his garage \u2014 long, European and \u201cremy,\u201d which means cut from one head, lined up roots to ends \u2014 is the most valuable. It is $4,000 per kilogram, roughly the going rate of truffles. High-grade Indian hair sells for $2,000 per kilogram.And that is where things get strange. Hair is unregulated, a largely hidden economy open to abuse.\u201cThere are a whole lot of people living off of hair,\u201d Ms. Tarlo, the anthropologist, said.The hair industry has expanded deliriously since Mr. Piazza started making wigs. It\u2019s filled with stories of fraud and theft and hair obtained from countries in upheaval. In that sense at least, he says, not much has changed.Mr. Piazza was not born with a passion for hair. He grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, where he met his wife, Beverly, when he was 16 at an Italian street festival. \u201cI came back from Vietnam, and I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI became a hairdresser because my wife was a hairdresser.\u201dMr. Piazza apprenticed himself to a German wigmaker after hairdressing school, then went to work for Enny of Italy, under Ernesto Capparelli.Many of New York\u2019s wigmakers were Italian. For much of the 20th century, Palermo, Sicily, was the drop-off spot for hair harvested far and wide, and Italy had become the center of the hair trade.Mr. Piazza remembers this as a time of creativity and drama. When synthetic fibers like Japanese Kanekalon appeared in the late 1960s, they drove down the price of wigs and caused the price of human hair to plummet. Some of New York\u2019s wig purveyors were incensed.Often, it wasn\u2019t clear what was real. By 1970, human hair mixed with synthetic or animal hair was so common that the Federal Trade Commission reminded wigmakers that \u201c\u2018true hair,\u2019 \u2018natural hair\u2019 and \u2018genuine hair\u2019 should mean human hair.\u201d That year, it issued regulatory guidelines. (They were rescinded in 1995.)Mr. Piazza started working for Kenneth Battelle in 1973, and he invited him to start a wig business under the Kenneth salon name in 1979. As the wig craze faded, Mr. Piazza diversified.He made falls, slides, clip-ons, topknots and toupees, a mustache for an open-coffin funeral. In 1976, he said, he was called in to make an emergency merkin for a Penthouse model who didn\u2019t have enough coverage. He made a line of hair ornaments that appeared in Vogue and looked suspiciously like fishing lures.And before long, Mr. Piazza began hunting for hair.\u201cWhen Kenneth first put me in business, it was very difficult to find European hair in this country,\u201d Mr. Piazza said. \u201cEveryone always said the finest hair comes from Italy.\u201d So he got a list of hair suppliers from the Italian Trade Commission and for the next several summers flew to Italy.\u201cI\u2019d grab a suitcase with like two T-shirts and a pair of jeans, and I\u2019d come home with about 80 pounds of hair,\u201d he said.Soon hairdressers and other wigmakers started requesting his services. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018Pick me up a couple pounds, I don\u2019t care if you make a few dollars. You\u2019ve got good hair.\u2019 So all of the sudden, I was a hair dealer.\u201dThe three-foot braids in Mr. Piazza\u2019s garage came into his possession in the mid-1990s. One day, two Russian men appeared in his shop carrying suitcases. \u201cNatural blonds, natural reds, straight off people\u2019s heads,\u201d he said. It was the kind of hair known in the industry as \u201cliquid gold\u201d \u2014 Caucasian hair untouched by Western chemicals, long and remy.\u201cI say, \u2018Whoa, fellows, you don\u2019t have to go no further; let\u2019s talk.\u2019\u201dOf his Russian dealer\u2019s shipments, Mr. Piazza recalled: \u201cSometimes it came stitched in pillows. Sometimes he would ship 20, 30 kilos of hair at a time. Sometimes I\u2019d be going to an apartment in Brighton Beach at 2 in the morning or meeting a plane at Kennedy. He\u2019d hand me a suitcase, and I\u2019d hand him an envelope.\u201dIt lasted just a decade. As capitalism spread, so too did Western hairstyles, hair dye and rapacious competition. Virgin hair became harder to find. The hair in the suitcases went from 36 inches long to 22, then to 18 and then to a barely usable six. \u201cIt got shorter and shorter,\u201d Mr. Piazza said. \u201cThen they couldn\u2019t get it no more.\u201dBut he figures he is pretty much set. \u201cI still have two lifetime supplies.\u201dFortunately for Mr. Piazza, hair decays very, very slowly. An Egyptian mummy on display at the American Museum of Natural History was put through a CT scanner, and the images revealed the outlines of what look like flattened pin curls on her skull.Standing in Mr. Piazza\u2019s garage among boxes and boxes of hair, I couldn\u2019t help wondering whether the hair, harvested decades ago, hadn\u2019t started to smell.\u201cDo you smell anything?\u201d Mr. Piazza asked, handing me a braid.The hair was clean and soft and had a faint, medicinal scent. Before I could answer, he announced: \u201cMothballs. Sometimes someone will come in and say, \u2018I smell like mothballs.\u2019\u201d He smiled and took the blame. \u201cI didn\u2019t wash it good enough. And I\u2019ll say, \u2018It\u2019s your imagination.\u2019 It\u2019ll come out.\u201dWhen we met at her home in Midwood, Brooklyn, she wore an apron over a sweater. Ms. Grunwald lost the lease on her salon on Coney Island Avenue, and for the moment she is working out of her basement.Among the usual wigmaking bric-a-brac are items specific to her Orthodox Jewish clientele: black hair tightly coiled around sticks that are baked to make curly, prosthetic payot (the traditional Orthodox side locks); a head form with a fluffy white beard for an Orthodox man with alopecia. \u201cIt\u2019s made of yak hair from Tibet,\u201d she said.Her own sheitel is shoulder length, gray and wavy. Orthodox women traditionally wear sheitels that are the same color and texture as their own hair, she said. Her custom wigs, which start at $3,800, are meant to be as close to an exact replica of their hair as possible, down to the part line and cowlicks. \u201cEvery one is like a fingerprint,\u201d she said of her wigs.When Ms. Grunwald arrived in New York, in 1949, her skills were in demand. Hats were going out of fashion, and sheitels were coming back. She immediately found a job with a wigmaker, and in 1960, after beauty school and marriage, she struck out on her own.The owner, Shulamit Amsel, acknowledges that she is in a different category than Ms. Grunwald. \u201cI\u2019m not a wigmaker,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a wig manufacturer.\u201dIn the wake of the ruling, women rushed to buy synthetic wigs as well as cloth head coverings at the Uptown Girl Snood Factory Outlet in Brooklyn. Burning the wigs was declared the only acceptable way of disposing of them.\u201cThen a man darted inside the ring of people to throw yet another wig on the fire.\u201dMs. Grunwald said: \u201cI thought it was ridiculous. Crazy, meshugas. It was the zealots that caused it to happen. There\u2019s nothing wrong with Indian hair.\u201d Ms. Amsel, of Shuly Wigs, said, \u201cIt\u2019s all connected to beliefs that we don\u2019t want to comment on whatsoever.\u201dSheitels eventually returned, some of them with kosher labels, but the decision had lingering consequences. India\u2019s exports were affected. \u201cThere were a lot of wigmakers,\u201d Ms. Grunwald said. \u201cThe men were sitting and learning Torah. The women were working as wigmakers to put food on the table. And that ruined a lot of women.\u201dShe paused.\u201cWe were all happy when it was over,\u201d she said. \u201cNow no one asks about Indian hair.\u201dRaffaele Mollica will tell you he is the last wigmaker. He will tell you loudly. He will shout and wave his arms and dismiss his competitors, even the deceased ones: \u201cThat hairpiece finagler?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the only wigmaker who can make a wig from start to finish on earth all by myself. If anyone thinks otherwise, I accept,\u201d he shouted, standing in his 84th Street atelier. \u201cWe can go into a room, bring our fabric, our hair, our ventilating needles, and we can make a wig.\u201dMr. Mollica, who goes by Raffa and Ralph, was born 71 years ago in Sicily and grew up in Astoria, Queens. His wigs start at about $5,000 and are known as Ralphs.They are so popular in international Orthodox Jewish communities that an impostor has been making imitations that he advertises around Israel, trading on Mr. Mollica\u2019s reputation. \u201cHe\u2019s a worthless scurve,\u201d said Mr. Mollica, showing me a flyer for the so-called Ralph Wig Collection. The real Mr. Mollica is the one who gets a call when they fall apart.Like Mr. Piazza, Mr. Mollica was a hairdresser who shifted to wigs during the wig craze, trading haircuts for wigmaking lessons from a retired ballerina from Italy. He was inspired by the naturalism of \u201cthe Vidal Sassoon revolution,\u201d he said, but after stints at salons including Vidal Sassoon, Kenneth and Elizabeth Arden, he opened his own studio in the 1980s, inspired by another revolution. \u201cThe chemotherapy revolution,\u201d he said.Mr. Mollica said chemotherapy changed his approach. Wigs for everyday use had to be both undetectable from a yard away and durable; wigs for film, TV and fashion don\u2019t have to be routinely washed or handled.Marcia Glikas, 65, found Mr. Mollica nearly 40 years ago, after trying injections and braided-in hair and falls to cover her rapidly thinning hair. She now has 20 Ralphs. \u201cI can\u2019t go in a convertible with my hair blowing in the wind, with my scarf blowing in the wind; I would love that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have hair, I have hair thanks to Raffa.\u201dHis wigs are as soft and light as he is brash. \u201cIn real life,\u201d Mr. Mollica told me, meaning if I were his client, \u201cyou would only want a wig to look like you do now. Naturally, sloppily correct as opposed to plasticized at the beauty parlor by some insane hairdresser.\u201dMs. Glikas came in for some upkeep on her wavy wig not long ago. \u201cI was shocked to find he was bald,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had lymphoma, after helping so many people.\u201d The cancer is in remission, Mr. Mollica said; he has no plans to leave the business. \u201cI\u2019ll retire when I die,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will never be another custom wigmaker after I die.\u201dNew York\u2019s Old World wigmakers have not systematically passed on their knowledge to apprentices, though they have taught countless immigrant women to weave hair for them. And when Merria Dearman, a wigmaker for theater productions, wanted to learn how to make wigs for the public, she said, she had to come seek them out.She was working at a salon and making wigs for companies like the Berkeley Repertory Theater, when one day she realized the wigs she was making for performers were higher quality than what was available for people with alopecia and cancer. \u201cThere is a gap in our market,\u201d she said. \u201cIt clicked.\u201dShe moved to New York from the San Francisco Bay Area. She sought out wigmakers like Mr. Piazza. \u201cImagine, I move here to learn this, and these are the guys I meet,\u201d Ms. Dearman, 40, said. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of a dying breed. They\u2019re the Italians everyone goes to.\u201dShe opened her studio three years ago, on 58th Street, and the clients rained in, mostly young women with hair loss. \u201cThey find me after they\u2019ve had their hearts broken by other wigs,\u201d she said.\u201cForget about this supposed \u2018I\u2019m a single black woman woe is me\u2019 epidemic,\u201d a writer for the news site The Root named Yesha Callahan wrote on her blog one day in 2010. \u201cThe real crisis sweeping the nation are lace-front hairlines that start at the eyebrows!\u201d Her tongue-in-cheek sendup of celebrities with imperfect wigs concluded: \u201cI blame Tyra and Beyonc\u00e9 for this lace-front wig epidemic.\u201dCelebrity culture is credited with \u2014 or blamed for \u2014 the sudden popularity of wigs. But Hadiiya Barbel, the former wig stylist on Wendy Williams\u2019s talk show, said the real instigator was technology. Celebrities had always worn extra hair. But in the 2000s, high-definition cameras created the need for a more convincing illusion.\u201cWe really had to make it look like it was coming out of her scalp,\u201d she said of Ms. Williams, who is vocal about her love for wigs. \u201cWe had to perfect the hairlines and balance it \u2014 add denseness, take away fullness.\u201d Like Tokyo Stylez, who has worked with Lil\u2019 Kim and Rihanna, Ms. Barbel became part of a new phenomenon: the celebrity wig stylist. The wigs in her line, Araya, run from $750 to $3,000.\u201cI started converting my clients from weaves to wigs,\u201d said Ms. Barbel, noting that they were the latest development in the so-called natural hair movement, which encourages black women to forgo harsh chemical treatments like relaxers or perms.Ms. Barbel, who shows off big, dramatic wigs on Instagram, recently got a feverish request from a Brazilian Carnival queen who had seen a video of her dancing: \u201cGive me that hair.\u201dEgypt Lawson, whose wig company Hairline Illusions operates in Harlem and Atlanta, said the big shift was that people spoke openly about wearing hair. \u201cVivica Fox took off a piece of her hairdo on TV \u2014 it\u2019s not so secretive like it used to be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Jewish wigs.\u201dFor people who can\u2019t afford their own wigmaker, the problem with wigs remains the quality. Lace-front wigs can be found for less than $100 at beauty supply stores or on Alibaba, the Chinese Amazon.com, which now sells directly to consumers. But they\u2019re made from processed hair \u2014 stripped of the cuticle, bleached, dyed, dipped in silicone \u2014 and can fall apart after a few washings, once the chemicals are gone.D\u2019Wanna Randolph\u2019s solution, like Mr. Piazza\u2019s so long ago, was to go find good hair herself. \u201cI got tired of getting bogus hair in the mail,\u201d said Ms. Randolph, a model who lives in Detroit and recently started Infallible Luxe, which sells hair online. She had been in two Delta Air Lines safety videos and took a job in customer service for the carrier so that she could travel free, inspecting small hair factories.She flew to Seoul, South Korea, and traveled through Southeast Asia with a fixer. Now she receives shipments of hair by courier \u2014 mainly extensions, from five countries. \u201cI got hair from Burma yesterday,\u201d she said. \u201cI get excited just thinking about it.\u201d She added: \u201cI keep it in the freezer 24 hours. I wash it and condition it with my own hands and hang it out to dry. I put all my hair in the freezer first, just to make sure there\u2019s no lice, no nits.\u201dIt shouldn\u2019t be surprising, given the abundance of raw hair, that black women are also hand-knotting their own wigs. Stephanie Park, the general manager of Apollo Beauty Land in Harlem, said sales for wigs were down at the hair supply store during the winter, when they usually peaked. \u201cPeople are doing it themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are getting crafty.\u201dThey are learning the once-rarefied art of wigmaking.Whereas in the past, apprentices had to sweep workshops and learn to sort hair for months before they could touch a ventilating needle, now people can simply watch YouTube.For the next 11 minutes, Jacquee demonstrates the ins and outs of weaving hair to lace. \u201cGrab the hair, pull, let it engage and then like so,\u201d she says. The video has nearly a half-million views.\u201cSo there you go, I hope you like it,\u201d she says. \u201cVery simple. Very easy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Emerging Market Stocks Have Come Roaring Back. Can They Go Any Higher?", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byFundamentallyPropelled by a rebound in commodity prices, emerging market stocks have roared back over the last year. But if the sector is to continue to prosper, many fund managers say, it will need to be fueled by other factors.Weak commodity prices, which contributed to emerging market mutual and exchange-traded fund losses in 2013, 2014 and 2015, helped these funds post double-digit gains in the first quarter of this year. The funds are now up almost 17 percent in the 12 months through March.\u201cWhat has been driving emerging market returns in the last year was the recovery in commodity prices, which led to a number of commodity producers\u2019 doing well,\u201d said Arjun Divecha, head of the emerging markets equity team at the asset management firm GMO.This explains why funds focused on oil-dependent markets have risen more than emerging market equities as a whole: iShares MSCI Russia Capped E.T.F., for instance, is up more than 28 percent over the 12 months through March, while iShares MSCI Brazil Capped E.T.F. is up nearly 39 percent as oil prices have climbed 37 percent.But commodity bets are notoriously volatile and will take you only so far with emerging market stocks, several fund managers say. Several other strategies may make more sense for the longer term.For example, Michael Kass, manager of the Baron Emerging Markets Fund, favors what he calls EM 2.0 \u2014 companies led by \u201cvalue creators\u201d working in cutting-edge areas like software development, machine learning, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and other health sciences. \u201cThe biggest profits will be found in high-profit-margin companies trying to gain market share in all those areas,\u201d he said.One such company is China\u2019s Alibaba Group, which like Amazon.com is branching out beyond online retail into areas like cloud computing, machine learning and robotic delivery mechanisms like drones and driverless cars. Alibaba is the top holding in the Baron Emerging Markets Fund.An added benefit of owning these types of high-quality growth stocks, Mr. Kass said, is that they are likely to hold up better than their peers if emerging markets take another spill \u2014 one set off, perhaps, by rising interest rates in China and the United States.Innovation is not the only factor that may determine the success of investments in the developing world. \u201cOne focus now is on structural reform stories,\u201d said Ben Kirby, co-manager of the Thornburg Developing World Fund. He points out that many countries have been trying to restructure their economies for more sustainable growth.China has embarked on \u201csupply-side reforms\u201d to tackle overcapacity in several crucial industries, including steel and coal. \u201cThey\u2019re shutting down idle capacity and high-cost producers,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. In fact, he said, this may be one reason commodity prices have started to lift as Chinese supply is being restricted.India has also embarked on an economic reform effort. It just passed a national goods and services tax, which will replace and untangle a web of local- and state-levied fees. The hope is that the tax shift will promote business activity across the vast country\u2019s different regions, while raising tax revenues.What type of company would benefit from that? \u201cOne stock we\u2019ve added to lately is ICICI Bank,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. ICICI is not the most dominant bank in India \u2014 that would be the Mumbai-based HDFC Bank, he said, which is a leading provider of mortgage loans.\u201cThe problem is HDFC is expensive,\u201d he said, noting that the stock trades at more than four times the company\u2019s book value. In contrast, ICICI trades at a small fraction of that multiple, Mr. Kirby said, and the bank\u2019s focus on corporate loans means it could benefit from any economic improvements in India brought about by reform.Another approach to emerging market investing, and a classic one, still works well, said James Syme, senior fund manager with J O Hambro Capital Management. Investors can focus on exporters \u201cthat benefit from demand in the developed world,\u201d he said.These can be companies like Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor, which supply components to Western technology manufacturers. But they can also be exporters that cater to consumers in the developed world, like the Hyundai Motor Company.\u201cIf you get a world where the U.S. and eurozone do well and China slows slightly,\u201d Mr. Syme said, \u201cyou want to be cautious with commodities, selective in the emerging-market consumer space, and look at this third way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marissa Mayer Will Make $186 Million on Yahoo\u2019s Sale to Verizon", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo shareholders will vote June 8 on whether to sell the company\u2019s internet businesses to Verizon Communications for $4.48 billion. A yes vote, which is widely expected, would end Marissa Mayer\u2019s largely unsuccessful five-year effort to restore the internet pioneer to greatness.But Ms. Mayer, the company\u2019s chief executive, will be well compensated for her failure. Her Yahoo stock, stock options and restricted stock units are worth a total of $186 million, based on Monday\u2019s stock price of $48.15, according to data filed on Monday in the documents sent to shareholders about the Verizon deal.That compensation, which will be fully vested at the time of the shareholder vote, does not include her salary and bonuses over the past five years, or the value of other stock that Ms. Mayer has already sold. All told, her time at Yahoo will have netted her well over $200 million, according to calculations based on company filings.Yahoo declined to comment on Ms. Mayer\u2019s compensation, apart from the information included in its legal filings.Most of Ms. Mayer\u2019s payout is based on the 208 percent increase in Yahoo\u2019s stock price since she left Google for Yahoo in 2012. Although Yahoo\u2019s core businesses of email, news and search continued to tread water under Ms. Mayer\u2019s leadership, long-held investments in Alibaba, China\u2019s leading e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, an affiliated company controlled by SoftBank, increased in value, driving up Yahoo\u2019s stock price.The sale to Verizon will leave those two investments, along with other assorted assets like a patent portfolio, in a new company called Altaba. The management of that company will seek to unlock the value of its $44 billion stake in Alibaba and its $9.5 billion stake in Yahoo Japan while minimizing a $15 billion tax bill that Yahoo estimates would be due on an outright sale.Yahoo said in its filing that Altaba is more likely to sell its Yahoo Japan stock than sell its Alibaba shares, but it gave no further details. Altaba will be led by Thomas McInerney, the Yahoo director who led the Verizon sale process.The filing also disclosed that Yahoo invested in Snap, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s hottest companies, buying 2.3 million shares in a March 2015 fund-raising round that priced the shares at $10.86. After a stock split that doubled the number of shares Yahoo owned, Snap went public in March. Snap shares are now trading at $21.20, valuing Yahoo\u2019s stake at $98 million.Yahoo also owns stakes in Hortonworks, an enterprise software company; Paperless, a digital event invitation service; and SeatGeek, a ticket reselling service. The company valued Excalibur, its portfolio of patents that are up for sale, at $740 million.The 2014 data breach prompted Yahoo and Verizon to renegotiate their original deal, which was struck in July. Eventually, they agreed to cut the price by $350 million.An article on Tuesday about money that Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, stands to receive if shareholders vote to sell the company\u2019s internet businesses to Verizon Communications misstated the amount of Snap stock owned by Yahoo. The company owns 4.6 million shares valued at $98 million, not 2.3 million shares valued at $49 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Sees Augmented Reality Ecosystem in Facebook", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported bySAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has long rued the day that Apple and Google beat him to building smartphones, which now underpin many people\u2019s digital lives. Ever since, he has searched for the next frontier of modern computing and how to be a part of it from the start.Now, Mr. Zuckerberg is betting he has found it: the real world.On Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg introduced what he positioned as the first mainstream augmented reality platform, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras.But in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s telling, there are few boundaries for how this technology will evolve. He said he envisioned a world in which people could eventually point smartphone cameras at a bowl of cereal and have an app create tiny sharks swimming in the milk. Friends can leave virtual notes for one another on the walls outside their favorite restaurants, noting which menu item is the most delicious.\u201cThink about how many of the things around us don\u2019t actually need to be physical,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in an interview last week. \u201cInstead of a $500 TV sitting in front of us, what\u2019s to keep us from one day having it be a $1 app?\u201dFacebook does not expect to build all of these software experiences itself. At its annual developer conference on Tuesday, it called for computer programmers to help by building augmented-reality-based apps to work with what Facebook calls its Camera Effects Platform. Facebook announced new tools to aid developers and will begin the initiative with a small number of partners in a closed test.Still, Mr. Zuckerberg said he intended to create the next major app ecosystem that would work with Facebook\u2019s in-app camera. If successful, Facebook could be in a position similar to that of Apple, which relies on the hundreds of millions of apps in its store to keep users buying the company\u2019s smartphones and tablets every year. Facebook, in turn, wants developers to build experiences that entice people to visit its website and apps on a daily \u2014 if not hourly \u2014 basis.\u201cJust like Apple built the iPod and iTunes ecosystem before the iPhone, you want to make sure there\u2019s a set of content there, even if there\u2019s not everything,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Facebook has been building toward this goal for some time. Mr. Zuckerberg has spent the last 18 months reorganizing his company and its suite of consumer apps \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 around a new interface, focused almost entirely on the camera. Slowly, the company has played down the role of text inside its apps, instead encouraging people to take and send photos and videos to one another by using the in-app camera features.In time, Facebook hopes that companies like Electronic Arts, Nike and Warner Brothers \u2014 which are part of the initial set of partners \u2014 will be the ones to bring immersive augmented reality experiences to Facebook\u2019s platform.One early partner app is Giphy Thoughts, made by Giphy, a start-up that acts as a search engine for animated GIFs, which play as something like short-form videos. With Giphy Thoughts, for instance, people can place cartoon thought bubbles above the heads of others they view through their Facebook camera lens.\u201cIt goes back to creative expression,\u201d said David Rosenberg, director of business development at Giphy. \u201cFacebook Camera is just going to be this massive audience of people ready to make deeply personal content they can share with their friends.\u201dWhether Facebook can make it worth the time of more developers to create such apps remains a question.\u201cSoftware developers might ask, why would I create something for Facebook\u2019s platform that I am presumably giving away for free?\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst for Jackdaw Research, an industry analysis firm. \u201cAnd then when competitors introduce A.R. offerings, will I have to create it for Facebook and then a different lens for Snapchat? Or do I wait for Apple and Google to release their A.R. platforms?\u201dThen came Facebook\u2019s most aggressive move, the acquisition of Oculus in 2014. Facebook is investing hundreds of millions of dollars more in V.R. content and apps in the hopes that it will mature into a full-fledged ecosystem similar to Apple\u2019s App Store, but sales of the Oculus Rift goggles have been slow.\u201cThey are shaking things up there but haven\u2019t quite found their stride,\u201d said Stephanie Llamas, head of virtual reality and augmented reality strategy at SuperData Research, a game industry research firm.Mr. Zuckerberg has said the efforts with Oculus will take longer than he and his team initially believed, and probably billions of dollars more in investment. But in the interview last week, he said some of the technology acquired in the Oculus purchase had helped produce the seeds of the new augmented reality platform.Another dark horse is Magic Leap, the secretive augmented reality start-up that has an enormous investment from Google and Alibaba and is working on hardware to offer a similar experience. The company has yet to unveil an official product.For the near term, however, Mr. Zuckerberg sees the smartphone camera as the first step forward.\u201cWe want to get to this world in the future where you eventually have glasses or contact lenses where you can mix digital or physical objects in the digital world,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Tech Investment Flying Under the Radar, Pentagon Warns", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byThere are few restrictions on investing in American start-ups that focus on artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robotics, the report contends, and China has taken advantage. Beijing, the report says, is encouraging its companies to invest for the purpose of pushing the country ahead in its strategic competition with the United States.In some instances, Chinese companies have made under-the-radar investments intended to dodge the oversight of a government agency, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as Cfius.\u201cIf we allow China access to these same technologies concurrently, then not only may we lose our technological superiority, but we may even be facilitating China\u2019s technological superiority,\u201d the report says.The report found that increasingly sophisticated commercial technology had blurred the lines between what was available to military consumers and civilian ones. Often start-ups and leading internet companies like Facebook and Google are working on products as sophisticated as anything the military has at its disposal.\u201cFor example, V.R. for gaming is at a similar level of sophistication as the V.R. used in simulators for our armed forces,\u201d the report said, referring to virtual reality. \u201cFacial recognition and image detection for social networking and online shopping has real application in tracking terrorists or other threats to national security,\u201d the report continued, which added that much of the autonomous vehicle and drone technology of today was developed using grants from the Pentagon.Last summer, the company received a $150 million joint investment from Ford and the Chinese internet giant Baidu. Baidu declined to comment on the investment.A Velodyne spokeswoman said the round represented its first outside investment.\u201cThe company obtained all necessary government clearances relating to the investment as part of the funding process,\u201d the spokeswoman wrote in an email. \u201cNotably, the investments were designed to make advanced LiDAR sensors more accessible to the broader industry, resulting in the development of safer, less expensive autonomous vehicles.\u201dAshton B. Carter, the former secretary of defense, commissioned the report as an urgent review of what senior Pentagon officials have considered China\u2019s alarming penetration of Silicon Valley, particularly in deals that finance nascent technology that has military applications.The report found that American private industry was mostly unaware of Beijing\u2019s efforts \u2014 many of the deals involve relatively small amounts of money \u2014 and that Washington did not have a strong understanding of the scale of the issue.\u201cThe U.S. government does not have a holistic view of how fast this technology transfer is occurring, the level of Chinese investment in U.S. technology, or what technologies we should be protecting,\u201d the report said.Michael A. Brown, the former chief executive of Symantec, led the study, called \u201cHow Chinese Investments in Emerging Technology Enable a Strategic Competitor to Access the Crown Jewels of U.S. Innovation.\u201d The New York Times reviewed a copy of the unclassified report.Mr. Carter declined to comment on the final document issued to cabinet officials last month.The report does not offer examples of American companies that have accepted Chinese investment and then found that their sensitive technologies were transferred to China.But it does take exception to tactics that it says Chinese funds have used to skirt government oversight. For example, it singles out Canyon Bridge, a venture capital firm that it says was formed to buy Lattice Semiconductor, an American microchip company. The firm has Chinese capital and American management expertise. The purpose of creating Canyon Bridge was to obscure the source of capital to \u201cenhance the possibility\u201d that the transaction would be approved by Cfius, the report said.Peter Kuo, a partner at Canyon Bridge, said that the there was never any intention to obscure the source of the fund\u2019s capital, as shown by meetings it had with Cfius before the deal was signed.Chinese investors plowed about $30 billion into early-stage technology through more than 1,000 funding deals between 2010 and 2016. During that time, participation from China rose to about 10 percent of total venture deals, with investment in crucial industries like artificial intelligence, robotics and augmented reality accelerating in 2016, according to the report.Among the investors identified in the report are well-known private firms and funds like Alibaba and Baidu. It also points to government-sponsored investors like Westlake Ventures, a fund in Redwood City, Calif., that is owned by the Hangzhou government, and ZGC Capital, an investor owned by 17 state-owned enterprises with an office in Santa Clara, Calif.The rising trend in venture capital investments has occurred alongside state-directed industrial espionage and online theft, which the American government has been unable to slow, the report says. In the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Silicon Valley field office, only 10 people are dedicated to counterespionage, and F.B.I. officials said in interviews for the report that it \u201chas very limited resources relative to the threat.\u201d\u201cThe scale of the espionage continues to increase,\u201d the authors say. \u201cDespite the rise in convictions, there is no way to know how big this problem really is.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how much money Chinese investors put into American early-stage technology between 2010 and 2016.

In many cases, they bring along their mothers and friends, generally supplementing the city\u2019s tax base with a kind of endocrinological tourism. Come for the Clomid, stay for Per Se.Some of Dr. Zhang\u2019s patients, envisioning further babies and more in vitro fertilization procedures and births in New York, wind up buying pieds-\u00e0-terre on West 57th Street, he told me. \u201cIt goes both ways,\u201d he remarked, meaning that he often receives patient referrals from real estate agents.One applicant quickly wrote in that she would love to win Dr. Zhang\u2019s lottery because she and her husband had been trying to conceive for eight years, and were now \u201cdesperate.\u201d Lotteries prey on the desperate, of course, and for this reason a similar scheme proposed in Britain several years ago was greeted with a certain horror by ethicists.

{"Headline": "Trump Targets Steel Trade, but China Will Be Tough to Contain", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byHANGZHOU, China \u2014 China\u2019s vast steel industry is a major target of President Trump. But this hulking shell of a mill here shows why China is likely to keep pumping out more and more steel, inflaming trade tensions between the two countries.The Hangzhou steel mill, a vast labyrinth of blast furnaces, warehouses, chimneys and worker dormitories covering hundreds of acres, was one of Mao Zedong\u2019s favorite projects. Built in just 13 months in the late 1950s, it once employed 25,000 workers.Pollution and the march of progress made the mill a liability. But closing a mill eliminates well-paying jobs \u2014 a central reason China keeps factories churning out steel the world doesn\u2019t need.When authorities do manage to shutter a plant, it is a costly ordeal, as the story of Hangzhou shows. With the help of a $34 million grant from government officials, the Hangzhou plant owner, Hangzhou Iron and Steel Group, offered the 12,000 remaining workers lavish severance benefits and pensions.\u201cI don\u2019t have to wake up early,\u201d said Tang Guomin, 49, who had labored at the blast furnaces since he was 18 years old. He received nearly six years\u2019 pay from the company as severance and when he turns 50 in a few months, he will be able to collect an inflation-adjusted pension from the government equal to 90 percent of his previous pay for the rest of his life.\u201cI sleep till I wake and don\u2019t have much to worry about,\u201d he said, while doing his family\u2019s morning vegetable shopping at a street market. \u201cI miss the factory, but that time won\u2019t be back again.\u201dInvoking an obscure trade law, President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday for a 270-day review to determine whether steel imports were harming national security. If the Commerce Department does find harm, Mr. Trump will have up to 90 days to decide whether to impose broad import restrictions.China is an obvious target of the order, though the impact could ripple worldwide. While only about 2 percent of American steel imports come directly from China, global steel makers and industry experts blame China for shipping its surplus steel to other countries, which drives down prices and prompts those countries to further process the steel into high-value products for export to the United States. The Trump administration, which has made it clear that it will take a more aggressive stance on steel, has suggested it could bring trade actions against those countries as well.China denies that it sells excess steel to other markets below the cost of making it, a move called dumping. But China does concede that it has too many steel factories making too much steel.\u201cSteel is the food for China\u2019s industry,\u201d said Wang Guoqing, the research director at the Lange Steel Information Research Center, a Chinese industry group in Beijing. \u201cIt is in a key position for China\u2019s development and infrastructure.\u201dToday, China\u2019s steel sector represents the sort of bloated, wasteful industry that people both inside and outside the country say is holding back economic development. China in early 2016 committed to closing steel mills representing 100 million to 150 million tons of capacity over five years, or roughly a tenth of its capacity then. China closed 65 million tons of capacity last year and plans to close another 50 million tons this year, according to a speech in early March by Premier Li Keqiang.Yet production remains stubbornly high, and new mills have continued to open. China\u2019s steel mills produced a record quantity of steel last month. China hasn\u2019t released more recent data on total steel capacity.\u201cTo me the objective is to make it uneconomic, to make it expensive, to do something that has inefficiency in the market,\u201d said Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to become United States trade representative, at his Senate confirmation hearing.China calls that effort shortsighted, saying it has made itself an indispensable provider of high-quality steel to the world at a time when many American steel mills are aging. Advocates of a more confrontational American trade policy fail to understand this, said Li Xinchuang, the dean of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, a government agency.\u201cI have explained this time and time again, but they won\u2019t listen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing the lute to a cow.\u201dThe former factory looks a little like a postapocalyptic scene on a Hollywood movie set: cavernous warehouses moldered on a damp spring day, windowless and doorless. Conveyor belts and other steel equipment that might have scrap metal value had already been removed, leaving barren concrete tubes and walls. A long row of black hopper cars rusted on a railroad siding.Migrant construction laborers camped in the evening in a dilapidated, three-story concrete building, resting after a long day of tearing apart old buildings as the next step in clearing the site. Tall grass, leafy bushes and even small trees had begun growing vigorously in open areas of the factory, sometimes pushing their way up through cracks in concrete plazas.\u201cIt looks beautiful,\u201d said Le Rong, a 42-year-old migrant worker involved in dismantling the complex. \u201cI even told my wife and kids about it.\u201dA Hangzhou Iron and Steel spokesman declined to discuss what the company would do with the site, saying it had not yet been decided but that the company would find an \u201cinnovative\u201d use for the land. Former steel mill sites in other prosperous Chinese cities like Hangzhou have often been redeveloped as real estate projects.Some of China\u2019s steel plants are outdated and many of them are polluting. Revamping them isn\u2019t cheap. In addition to the $34 million it received to close the Hangzhou plant, Hangzhou Iron and Steel in 2015 received nearly $106 million in subsidies and cheap government loans to help cover overall costs of upgrading its plants.For many locals, closing the mill has meant cleaner air \u2014 the reason officials said the mill was shut down.State-run media said shortly before the Hangzhou mill closed that the aging site had been releasing 7,000 tons a year of sulfur dioxide, an important cause of acid rain, and 3,000 tons a year of soot.Xu Yuemei, another retired steelworker, said that when the factory was still operating, garments that she hung on a clothesline turned black or yellow before they dried. Mr. Tang remembers a pervasive haze.\u201cThere was dust in the air; I couldn\u2019t see guys 100 meters away from me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI could smell choking ammonia gas in the air until the factory shut down.\u201d\u201cAfter it shut down,\u201d he said, \u201ceverything is gone, including the pollution.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsherAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Zeal for China Dims, Global Companies Complain More Boldly", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 When Amazon announced its entry into the Chinese cloud computing market last year, Chinese state media celebrated it as \u201ca strong signal\u201d that \u201cthere is tremendous room for foreign firms to expand in the Chinese market as long as they comply with local regulations.\u201dToday, cloud computing is the latest area of contention between China and increasingly frustrated global companies.In late March, a group of more than 50 American lawmakers sent a letter to the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, taking direct aim at China\u2019s restrictions on cloud computing. They wrote that current and draft regulations would force the transfer of valuable intellectual property to Chinese companies and effectively bar foreign cloud service providers \u201cfrom operating or competing fairly in China.\u201d\u201cAs we see it,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, \u201cthese restrictions are fundamentally protectionist and anticompetitive.\u201d Many of the lawmakers hail from states where two major cloud computing players, Amazon and Microsoft, have operations.Big global companies, which have long worked to keep from rocking the boat in China, are showing a bit more tolerance for making waves. The business groups that represent them have become more critical of China\u2019s industrial policies and ambitions. Businesses are increasingly complaining to friendly lawmakers, and those lawmakers have become more vocal on their behalf.Profiles in courage are still hard to find, as businesses fear Chinese retaliation if they complain directly or too loudly. For example, among the companies that would benefit most from any shift in China\u2019s cloud computing regulations, Microsoft, through a spokesman, declined to comment, and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.The shift is also a gradual one, taking place in the years since the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, as the promise of a more open China faded. Still, people in business circles in China say the sense of disappointment in China\u2019s business prospects is growing.\u201cThe enthusiasm is gone,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. \u201cForeign businesses here used to be very excited about China and quite enthusiastic. Now, it\u2019s kind of a grind and a battle.\u201dChina remains a lucrative market for foreign-branded cars, iPhones, high-value engineering equipment and other costly items. Still, the growing frustration has muddled the corporate response to President Trump\u2019s tough anti-China rhetoric.\u201cThere are companies, which in prior years have been strong supporters in Washington of the U.S.-China relationship, who are much quieter, and even waiting to see if a tougher approach might get more results with China,\u201d said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council.\u201cIf the United States gives concessions in the trade area so that we don\u2019t push as hard on leveling the playing field in all these different areas,\u201d Mr. Zarit said at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday, \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame.\u201dIn public, businesses work hard to strike a sunny note. Last November, Jay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for global corporate affairs and former White House spokesman, made no mention of his company\u2019s challenges there when speaking at China\u2019s World Internet Conference, according to a Chinese-language transcript of his remarks in state media.That reticence has bred frustration among some United States officials. In 2015, President Barack Obama told the Business Roundtable, a business group, regarding its complaints about China, \u201cDon\u2019t tell us on the side, \u2018We\u2019ve got this problem, you need to look into it, but then \u2014 but leave our names out of it.\u2019\u201dStill, executives say complaining can have an impact. Earlier that same year, Mr. Obama publicly criticized proposed Chinese rules that would require technology companies to turn over encryption keys to Chinese authorities. His administration had also expressed concern about Chinese draft regulations that would require China\u2019s financial sector buy only from \u201csecure and controllable\u201d suppliers, which trade groups said effectively meant Chinese companies. In both cases China relented, temporarily scrapping the banking laws and tempering the language in the antiterrorism law.Some intermediaries between business and China are pushing the government to do even more.\u201cCountries need to be persuaded. Words don\u2019t do it,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former United States ambassador to China, adding that the United States needs to use \u201cproperly targeted\u201d leverage.\u201cI don\u2019t think the United States has done much of that,\u201d Mr. Baucus said. \u201cWe need to have a more strategic economic approach to China.\u201dHe said Mr. Obama had raised the issue of American companies\u2019 unequal access to the Chinese market repeatedly with Beijing, but these appeals were \u201cinsufficient.\u201dOf all the sectors that China has set its sights on, tech has come under the most pressure. Services like Facebook and Twitter have long been blocked. Last November, China passed a cybersecurity law that would impose security checks on companies in industries like finance and communications and mandatory in-country data storage. In 2015, the American chip maker Qualcomm said it would pay $975 million for violating China\u2019s antimonopoly law. In 2016, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. In the same year, China said it would demand answers to new questions about Microsoft\u2019s business practices in the country.In cloud computing, China mandates that foreign companies work with a local partner, and the foreign companies are subject to equity restrictions that prevent them from owning a controlling stake in the cloud company. New draft regulations would make it even more difficult for them to get licenses for operation, block them from using their brands and logos to market their services and require them to \u201cterminate the transmission of\u201d and report any information posted or transmitted by users that \u201cviolates relevant Chinese laws and regulations.\u201dIn China, the cloud computing market is estimated to be worth $20 billion by 2020, up from $1.5 billion in 2013, according to the consulting group Bain. Both Amazon and Microsoft operate in China through partnerships with local companies. In contrast, Aliyun, the cloud services unit of the Chinese web giant Alibaba, has its own data centers in the United States.For decades, Western companies have stood with China even during rocky moments in the Sino-American relationship. When Congress threatened to revoke China\u2019s most-favored-nation trading status in the 1990s because of concerns over human rights, the American Chamber of Commerce in China, or AmCham, headed to Washington to defend Beijing.More recently, the complaints from Western companies have gotten louder, as China\u2019s economic growth slows and unease grows about Beijing\u2019s failure to deliver on its promise to open markets for foreign companies as well as its Made in China 2025 plan to push for greater self-sufficiency in several industries. AmCham\u2019s 2016 survey of its members showed that 81 percent of its companies felt less welcome in China than before, up from 77 percent in 2015. The survey also showed that 31 percent of its members said the investment environment was deteriorating \u2014 the most pessimistic response AmCham has received since it started asking the question in 2011.\u201cChina\u2019s heavy emphasis on building global champions through industrial policies is spiking new levels of concern about China\u2019s commitment to a mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d said Jeremie Waterman, senior director for the Greater China region for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Mr. Zarit, of AmCham, said a \u201cmixed bag\u201d of companies were unhappy about the investment climate in China, adding that \u201cthey are afraid if anything is done, it will upset the apple cart.\u201dMr. Zarit, who led a delegation of eight former AmCham chairmen to meet with the Trump administration officials in Washington in February, said there was a new realization in Washington \u201cthat this asymmetrical commercial relationship needs to be addressed in some way.\u201dMr. McGregor, who was on the trip, said they met Peter Navarro, a strident China critic in charge of trade and industrial policy, and Matthew Pottinger, Mr. Trump\u2019s top Asia policy maker. There, the delegation pushed the concept of reciprocity, meaning that if American companies are bound by restrictions in China, their Chinese counterparts should be subject to the same limits in the United States.Mr. McGregor said the idea got \u201cquite a bit of traction.\u201d He added, \u201cOur attitude is China should be treated as an equal, and an equal needs reciprocity.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.
