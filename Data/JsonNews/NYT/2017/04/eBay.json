That\u2019s true for now, but perhaps Uber and other industries like it end up going the way of airlines eventually? If an industry isn\u2019t regulated and essentially holds a monopoly over the sector, what keeps Uber from making things worse on consumers over time? We\u2019ve already been asked to use UberPool, which makes us pack into the car with other people. Perhaps there are other ways to improve Uber\u2019s margins over time.Is that me being too cynical?The bigger story is that algorithms are widening the gap between businesses and people. Outsourcing these tasks to computers may save companies money in the short term. But these public relations disasters are likely to cost them far more in the long term. United lost $1 billion from its market cap in a day. And I heard one class-action lawyer on CNN say the passenger could get a dollar for every person who has watched the video of him being bloodied up by airport cops. That\u2019s a lot of dollars. The irony is that this guy will never have to fly commercial again.Is there anything in the security world I should be paying attention to right now?

{"Headline": "The Sunny Escapism of the Photographer Gray Malin", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported by\u201cHoney, doesn\u2019t this look just like a Gray Malin photograph?\u201dMr. Malin, 31, was understandably thrilled and introduced himself. \u201cThey were on their honeymoon, we took a photo and it was so cute,\u201d he said. \u201cBut really, I was just as surprised as she was.\u201dMr. Malin\u2019s rise dovetailed with that of Instagram, where he has more than 231,000 followers, and the platform exposed his work to celebrity fans including Rihanna and Reese Witherspoon. \u201cHis beautifully composed aerial images caught my eye,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon wrote in an email. \u201cI love the feeling they evoke of beautiful days in the sun and living a colorful life.\u201dLike an Amazon algorithm, Mr. Malin has figured out, through every step of his photography career, what his audience liked and then altered his output accordingly.In 2009, he was selling prints for $65 apiece at flea markets around Los Angeles. \u201cI met and networked and learned what people were looking for in their homes, and if something did resonate, I thought, \u2018How can I further develop this work into other work that people will want to hang?\u2019\u201d he said, sitting at an enormous computer monitor in the conference room of his company\u2019s headquarters in West Hollywood, Calif. Outside, a dozen young staff members tapped diligently in front of similarly oversize screens.\u201cEvery photograph I started to take went from photography to fine-art photography to photographs that are meant to look great inside your home,\u201d Mr. Malin said. \u201cIt was like social media before social media.\u201dHe is intimately acquainted with such a concept: His mother, Amy Muzzy Malin, edited the interior design sections of Glamour and Mademoiselle magazines before the family moved from New York to Dallas (his father is a real estate developer). In Dallas, Ms. Malin oversaw photo shoots and scouted locations for other magazines, and often brought Gray along.\u201cI\u2019d do my homework in the corner while they were shooting interiors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I was very aware of, at a young age, how a room looked.\u201dAt 16, he took a high school photography class, spending nights and weekends in the darkroom and studying the clean lines of the Hungarian photographer Andre Kertesz. At Emerson College, Mr. Malin studied photography and marketing, to appease his parents.\u201cI realized I didn\u2019t want to do commercial work or portraiture,\u201d Mr. Malin said. \u201cI really wanted to do fine art, which sounds so 21-year-old-y.\u201d He enrolled in continuing-education classes and took odd jobs like assisting on a wedding. \u201cI shot some family in Manhattan Beach\u2019s Christmas card,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all wore white shirts and jeans.\u201dSix months later, in September 2010, he returned to Marfa to do a more organized shoot around the Prada store. His lanky cousin served as a model, his father\u2019s buddy brought a mule, and a friend from Paramount brokered a deal for secondhand Prada shopping bags after Mr. Malin\u2019s eBay searches came up empty. \u201cIt\u2019s hysterical how hard it is to get shopping bags,\u201d he said.\u201cI hadn\u2019t really seen anything like it,\u201d said Susan Feldman, a founder of One Kings Lane.The site would put up limited quantities of Mr. Malin\u2019s prints and they would routinely sell out; he would invite friends over to watch movies while they slapped labels on boxes. \u201cIt was just what I was hoping \u2014 I was seeding myself into these somewhat affluent homes all over the country,\u201d Mr. Malin said.He eventually embarked on more ambitious projects: shooting beach scenes from helicopters over Miami and Kauai, Hawaii, and joining a National Geographic expedition to Antarctica, where he juxtaposed a beach ball with hulking glaciers.\u201cNow,\u201d Mr. Malin said, \u201cthey really want to get paid.\u201dMr. Malin himself is a low-key presence, spending summers on Lake Michigan with his husband, Jeff Richardson, a former business analyst for Mattel and Disney who became the chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Gray Malin last year and oversees pesky things like shipping and logistics.Mr. Malin wears polo shirts and sweaters around his neck and chooses not to dye gray streaks in his close-cropped hair. At a Vanity Fair party before the Oscars, while sequined starlets swirled around, he gushed that the most exciting week of his life was when Jenna Bush filmed a \u201cToday\u201d show segment on him and Maria Shriver came over to look at prints. \u201cIn one week, there was a Kennedy and a Bush in my house,\u201d he said.As for the current administration, \u201cthe day after the election, my dad called me and said, \u2018Are you kind of excited about this, for your brand?\u2019\u201d Mr. Malin said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Are you kidding? I\u2019m devastated!\u2019\u201d\u201c\u2018But think about it, you bring this escape to everyone,\u201d he remembers his father telling him. \u201c\u2018And now more than ever, people are going to need the escape.\u2019\u201dIndeed, Mr. Malin\u2019s professional Instagram profile says that he is \u201con a mission to make every day a getaway.\u201d In the aquamarine-hue feed of photos that follows, there is no indication of political tensions or nuisances like Mondays and hailstorms. If art reflects the times, this art reflects a collective desire to decamp to some place with beautiful natural light and no visible charging cables. While Mr. Malin claims he knows \u201clike, no artists,\u201d some have taken note.\u201cI get jealous sometimes,\u201d Mr. Ugalde said. \u201cI get jealous in a very positive way. He\u2019s very young, he\u2019s not trying to influence the collector or the observer with big philosophical, conceptual messages. Sometimes, it\u2019s just to make people happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Embraces a Nasty Gal, Based on the Real Deal", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byWhen the screenwriter Kay Cannon started shopping around her new show \u2014 a comedy loosely based on the Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso\u2019s rise from Dumpster-diving shoplifter to the e-commerce fashion queen of the early aughts \u2014 television executives requested some revisions.\u201cIt always comes down to this idea of the female lead having to be incredibly likable,\u201d Ms. Cannon said. \u201cI wanted to tell the story of a flawed woman that is not a fairy tale.\u201d\u201cGirlboss\u201d was born when Ms. Amoruso\u2019s \u201c#GIRLBOSS\u201d \u2014 partly a memoir of her rise to success, partly a manifesto for inspiring other women to rise, too \u2014 landed in the hands of Charlize Theron. She optioned the book and brought it to Ms. Cannon, one of Hollywood\u2019s most in-demand writers of female comedic characters.Ms. Cannon made her mark as a writer and producer working for Tina Fey on \u201c30 Rock,\u201d where she was nominated for an Emmy, then on the Fox series \u201cNew Girl\u201d and as the writer of the successful \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d films. Along the way, she signed a development deal with 20th Century Fox TV. But when she and Ms. Theron refused to water down the \u201cGirlboss\u201d concept \u2014 or to ditch the title \u2014 television networks passed. Netflix snapped it up.In the pilot, Sophia is a listless 23-year-old who is allergic to responsibility. She steals a sandwich from her boss and a rug from the side of the street. Only when she finds a cheap vintage jacket and decides to style it and flip it on eBay \u2014 the spark of what becomes a dizzyingly successful online fashion business \u2014 is she challenged to grow up.\u201cI wanted to be able to show how mad she was at the beginning,\u201d Ms. Cannon said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very real response when you\u2019re lost, rudderless and don\u2019t know what your life is about.\u201d If the show had ended up on a network, \u201cI don\u2019t know if we would have been able to really capture that element,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you find her off-putting at the beginning, you\u2019re going to turn the channel.\u201dAdapting Ms. Amoruso\u2019s story for television meant exaggerating her highs and lows. The Sophia of the pilot is more aggressive and less mature than the real woman was. \u201cI am very proud to have not been a petty thief at the time I started my business,\u201d Ms. Amoruso said. \u201cI had outgrown that by the time eBay rolled around.\u201d What\u2019s true, she added, is this: \u201cI was a really lost 23-year-old, and I had no idea what my talents were yet.\u201dMs. Robertson described creating the fictional Sophia as a balancing act. \u201cI was told, \u2018We need her to be tenacious, we need her to be passionate, we need her to be driven, and we need her to be smart and dumb and weird,\u2019 and all of these things that make her appealing to audiences,\u201d she said.\u201cBut she also has a very specific following, so we wanted to cater certain parts of the character to the audience that has followed her and supported her.\u201dPart of the challenge for Ms. Cannon in creating the character was that she was based on a colleague: Ms. Amoruso is an executive producer on the show. \u201cAaron Sorkin wasn\u2019t hanging and having dinners with Mark Zuckerberg,\u201d Ms. Cannon acknowledged, referencing \u201cThe Social Network.\u201dBut she said that she was impressed by Ms. Amoruso\u2019s openness about her own mistakes. Ms. Amoruso contributed styling advice, sometimes lending items from her own closet, and weighed in on anecdotal material from her past. \u201cBeyond that, when there is a show being made about your life, it\u2019s best to stay out of the way, because the last thing you want to be is the person meddling to preserve their reputation,\u201d Ms. Amoruso said.But to Ms. Cannon, the spots and stains in Ms. Amoruso\u2019s success story only give her more material to turn into compelling television. \u201cThat\u2019s all storytelling for us in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Netflix were to give us more seasons, we\u2019d explore her catapult into success and all the problems that come with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Wanting protagonists to be likable signals a lack of sophistication. Making protagonists \u201cdifficult\u201d is a sign of authenticity.The fictional Sophia \u2014 each episode begins with a note that the show is a \u201creal loose\u201d version of Ms. Amoruso\u2019s story \u2014 is at the far end of the TV scale of difficulty. And she\u2019s all the more realistic for that. If you don\u2019t know a woman whom you love despite her characteristic anger, obsessiveness, insensitivity and refusal to listen to others, you may dismiss Sophia as a caricature. If you do, one moment after another in \u201cGirlboss\u201d will ring surprisingly true.But truth doesn\u2019t necessarily equal drama, or in this case half-hour inspirational dramedy. It\u2019s fine that the Sophia of \u201cGirlboss\u201d isn\u2019t likable. The problem is that she isn\u2019t particularly interesting.It\u2019s a big problem, because for the show to work, we need to see what the other characters \u2014 like Sophia\u2019s best friend, Annie (Ellie Reed), and her maybe-boyfriend, Shane (Johnny Simmons) \u2014 see in her. Neither Ms. Cannon nor Britt Robertson, who plays Sophia, is able to make it apparent.Ms. Cannon\u2019s strategy appears to be to foreground Sophia\u2019s vulnerability and self-hatred \u2014 after episodes of boorishness or violent anger, she\u2019s liable to loudly ask herself why she\u2019s such a jerk. It\u2019s another realistic touch, but it doesn\u2019t make us care any more about her. Ms. Robertson convincingly portrays Sophia\u2019s defensiveness and irritating energy, but there\u2019s a pinched, limited quality to her performance. Sophia needs charisma, and Ms. Robertson hasn\u2019t found it.The bigger issue may be the disconnect between the part of \u201cGirlboss\u201d that wants to be a character study and the part that needs to be a conventionally entertaining series. The roots of Sophia\u2019s personality are addressed briefly, in vague and heavily clich\u00e9d terms (blame the parents). Otherwise her thorniness sits uncomfortably inside a stylized comedy that\u2019s equal parts oddball and striving for the outrageous.(The tech-business side of the story, in which a series of epiphanies takes Sophia from unemployed boho to eBay seller to e-commerce mogul, feels about as savvy as the copy of \u201cStarting an eBay Business for Dummies\u201d that Sophia shoplifts.)As she demonstrated in \u201cPitch Perfect,\u201d Ms. Cannon can write a funny line and sketch in an appealing character, and a number of performers benefit from this in small, spiky roles: Jim Rash as a vintage-clothing store owner, Norm MacDonald as a security guard, Melanie Lynskey as an eBay rival, Louise Fletcher as a curmudgeonly neighbor. They\u2019re all likable, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arconic C.E.O. Ousted After Sending Unauthorized Letter to Hedge Fund", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byAs chief executive of Alcoa, Klaus Kleinfeld oversaw an effort to split the company in two. Last year, he won board approval to spin off what was supposed to be a fast-growing subsidiary, Arconic, and became the new company\u2019s C.E.O.Yet just months later, Mr. Kleinfeld is out at Arconic, after mounting pressure from the big hedge fund Elliott Management and a letter he sent in response without his board\u2019s approval.It is a big and surprising shake-up at Arconic as the company faces Elliott\u2019s campaign to further remake its board. Investors are scheduled to vote on whether to add four directors to its board next month, as Elliott argues that Arconic continues to waste money and miss profit targets.Part of those efforts centered on ousting Mr. Kleinfeld, who as the chief executive of Arconic drew the hedge fund\u2019s ire for failing to lift the company\u2019s stock price.At the time of the split, Alcoa was grappling with falling aluminum prices and investor pressure to concentrate on higher-margin operations, including making parts for aerospace and auto companies.Such splits had gained favor on Wall Street as corporate executives believed that investors valued the focus that the move brought to the management teams of each new business. Companies like eBay and Hewlett-Packard have pursued that kind of breakup to drive up their stock prices.Still, shares in what is now Arconic have fallen more than 70 percent since Mr. Kleinfeld became chief executive in 2008.That drew the attention of Elliott, a $33 billion hedge fund founded by Paul E. Singer that has pressed for changes at Samsung and in the government of Argentina.Both publicly and privately, Elliott has chided Mr. Kleinfeld and Arconic for wasteful spending on its Midtown Manhattan headquarters and its rebranding ad campaign that featured the Jetsons.But ultimately, the tenure of the German-born Mr. Kleinfeld ended abruptly once he sent Elliott a letter without consulting his fellow board members.\u201cIt is Elliott Management\u2019s decision whether to continue to burden Arconic and its shareholders with its highly disruptive and distracting proxy fight, or to support Arconic in facilitating an effective C.E.O. search and a strong transition,\u201d the company said.By Elliott\u2019s reckoning, however, the letter was much more serious.In its own statement, the hedge fund contended that the message \u201cread as a threat to intimidate or extort\u201d a senior executive at the firm based on false insinuations. Elliott notified Arconic\u2019s board last week about the message.Elliott added, \u201cIt is simply the latest debacle in a pattern of conduct in which the board has repeatedly excused, endorsed and participated in Dr. Kleinfeld\u2019s poor leadership and attempts to entrench himself and his allies on the board.\u201dMr. Kleinfeld will be replaced as chief executive on an interim basis by David P. Hess, a former top executive at United Technologies who joined Arconic\u2019s board this year. His role as chairman will be filled in the interim by the company\u2019s lead director, Patricia Russo.Arconic has said previously that electing Elliott\u2019s directors could cost shareholders $500 million, under the rules governing changes in corporate control within an employee trust. Elliott has derided that claim as a company-created liability meant to entrench the board.The hedge fund, which has also proposed its own candidate for chief executive, was unmoved by the interim appointments. The hedge fund argued that the current board had stood by Mr. Kleinfeld until the letter and showed no appetite for changing his strategy.Shares in Arconic closed up 3 percent on Monday, at $26.69, after initially jumping in response to the news of Mr. Kleinfeld\u2019s departure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New York Building Inhabited Entirely by Creative People", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byA group of friends is keeping the bohemian spirit of Greenwich Village alive in a Ninth Street townhouse \u2014 at least until September.IF YOU ARE A NEW YORKER, chances are you\u2019ve strolled the streets of Greenwich Village at night, peeking into windows and concocting stories about the fabulous freaks, titans and reprobates on the other side of those panes. If you\u2019d taken such a stroll down East Ninth Street, you might have skipped the drab building in the middle of a row of townhouses: The four-story Greek Revival structure, built in 1844, is among the least distinctive of those on the north side of this wide block, though it was once much grander than it now appears. The facade likely had steps up to an imposing front door, but that is all gone now \u2014 ripped out when the single-family building was converted to apartments around 1920. Now, you descend three steps to a plain front door that leads to gloomy hallways, the walls a light yellow grayed by years of grime.But the frumpy face of 17 East Ninth Street belies its rich history, a microcosm of the struggle between beauty and commerce, art and real estate, the creators and the patrons who made Manhattan and continue to reshape it to this day. As the city succumbs to sleek glass monuments to hedge-fund hegemony, 17 remains a boho vestige and a precarious homage to the creative churn that made Greenwich Village famous from Los Angeles to Laos.They didn\u2019t live to meet their last tenant, Fernando Santangelo, but they would have approved. The Frosts both died last fall, around the same time Santangelo moved into the long-vacant garden apartment \u2014 no kitchen, just a hot plate, a sink and a small fridge. The three small rooms were packed with dusty boxes and a lifetime of ephemera, most of it belonging to the Frosts. Santangelo, an interior designer, could not have been happier. \u201cI am attracted to the broken down,\u201d he says, \u201cand feel comfortable with the imperfection of age.\u201dAnd a small part of her still lives there. Santangelo found additional sculptures buried among the boxes, including some work that now sits in his living room, totems of a great cultural movement and the grubby glory that was Greenwich Village.Last year, Jerry Schwartz, a set designer living on the third floor since 2012, happened to mention his address to Coliena Rentmeester, a photographer friend. \u201cNot the Frosts!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cOh my god!\u201d It turned out that she and her husband, the director Tom Dey, had once lived in the very apartment Schwartz now occupies. The Frosts had always been a secretive couple \u2014 by all accounts happiest in their own company \u2014 but Dey offered one scant, tantalizing rumor: The jazz musician Dave Brubeck may have once played their baby grand.Schwartz had discovered the building in a website listing. \u201cThere were no photos,\u201d he recalls, \u201cjust the street. It said \u2018Funky, fabulous, one-and-a-half baths, spiral staircase, artist\u2019s studio.\u2019 It looked too good to be true.\u201dWhen the broker showed Schwartz the building, he was dismayed by the outside and the rundown hallways. Inside, the apartment wasn\u2019t much better. But there were nearly floor-to-ceiling, small-paned windows on the first floor and a skylight on the second, plus two working fireplaces. It was April, and the branches of the ailanthus were spread as wide as the living room, creating a treehouse effect. \u201cI fell in love,\u201d he says.The day he moved in, as he climbed the stairs toward his new home, a door opened a crack. \u201cJerry Schwartz,\u201d the man in apartment 3 said, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d Walter Obal, a makeup artist who had worked with Schwartz, was sharing the second floor with Jeffrey Simpson, author of the memoir \u201cAmerican Elegy,\u201d who has now lived there for 12 years. Their tiny one-bedroom apartments share a wall; each has a miniature kitchen and bathrooms, though Obal has an enviable claw-footed bathtub.Visiting the building is akin to opening the doors of a Christmas Advent calendar, with a surprise in each apartment. Simpson\u2019s, facing the street, is a fantasy land of Victoriana; Obal\u2019s place, at the back, is modern and spare. Schwartz has transformed his duplex into a nest of elegant, John Derian-inflected whimsy. \u201cYou see everyone\u2019s personalities so distinctly,\u201d says Santangelo, who grew up in Uruguay and moved to New York in 1980. \u201cWhen I first came to the city, people had these funky apartments and you were constantly encountering unique people and situations. That\u2019s more unusual now. We tend to be influenced by \u2018the latest.\u2019 It\u2019s rare to see the layers you find in this building.\u201dSimpson, Obal and Schwartz quickly became friends, eating together, looking out for each other, bonding over the eccentricities of the Frosts. \u201cRuth had this absolutely frustrated sense of drama,\u201d Simpson says. \u201cWhen they told me I could have the apartment, she said\u201d \u2014 he adopts a Katharine Hepburn quaver \u2014 \u201c\u2009\u2018You never know what you\u2019ll see in these halls!\u2019\u2009\u201d Simpson laughs, in part because he later learned that the couple was watching their tenants come and go on a closed-circuit TV; the camera was in the lobby and they had positioned chairs in front of a screen outside their bedroom \u2014 a reality show with an audience of just two.But by early last year, it was plain the Frosts, both in their 90s, were having a hard time. They were childless, and in the last decade of their life they appeared to be friendless. When their bathroom ceiling caved in last February, the firemen who arrived were concerned; Ruth was 91 and had dementia; Ed, 93, was clearly struggling to take care of her and the last of their many beagles \u2014 this one hadn\u2019t left the apartment for months. (The kitchen was covered in feces.) Ruth and Ed were taken to the hospital, then to a series of nursing homes.After the Frosts left the building, Schwartz took over: What else could he do? It wasn\u2019t just that he loved his apartment; he couldn\u2019t let go of what the building represented. He kept everything running \u2014 paying bills, depositing rent checks, making sure the dog had a new home. A guardian appointed by the state suggested that, in order to help pay for the Frosts\u2019 assisted-living expenses, the two vacant apartments be rented to generate income.Long before she moved in, Shapton had admired a feature of her studio from afar, on one of those meandering New York walks, imagining life behind the facades. \u201cI was sharing a Popsicle with my daughter across the street,\u201d she says, \u201cand through the windows of the top floor I saw this amazing skylight.\u201d It reminded her of the historic ateliers a block over on Eighth Street, near a famed art school. \u201cI\u2019d always wondered what it was like to live in one of those.\u201d Daylight floods the place; she never has to use a lamp. All of the apartments have working fireplaces, and on some gloomy afternoons, Shapton has worked by the glow of the flames.After moving in, they threw a holiday party that included everyone in the building. \u201cIt was like those chaotic, bohemian Greenwich Village scenes that you read about in books or see in movies,\u201d Schwartz says (minus the copious cigarette smoke). All the tenants had, at some point, imagined a New York life like that. \u201cAnd then you moved here and figured out that it was a fantasy, and the Village was unattainable,\u201d Julavits says. \u201cThis is the closest I\u2019ve come.\u201d8 Photos\u201cHERE\u2019S THE THING,\u201d Schwartz says. \u201cThe rents here are not super cheap; they\u2019re fair for what they are. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re starving artists or squatting. But when you look just across the street, where a building sold for $39 million\u201d \u2014 he points through his window, at the back of a 10th Street townhouse \u2014 \u201cor that one over there, which has an apartment renting for $20,000 a month, you can\u2019t help but feel how unfortunate it is that these kinds of places are disappearing.\u201d Rather than a young Bob Dylan, in other words, you\u2019re more likely to find that Mary-Kate Olsen is your neighbor.By the 1980s, Greenwich Village had begun to change, a transition hastened by the AIDS epidemic; as residents died off or moved away, rents would be jacked up fourfold. With the yuppification of the Village, artists fled to the East Village. Within a few years, Greenwich Village as a creative hub was done.She recently visited the Frosts\u2019 apartment for the first time \u2014 rooms stuck in time, like Miss Havisham. \u201cIt was kind of amazing and touching to meet these people who aren\u2019t alive anymore, through their things,\u201d Julavits says. \u201cIt\u2019s the last collected moment for all their objects and then everything is going to get atomized.\u201dThe whole building, this vestige of bohemian Greenwich Village, might be atomized before the end of the year. When they died, the Frosts left it to a charity, which has since placed it on the market for $9.75 million. As of September, the tenants will likely have to leave. \u201cWe all really hoped that together we could figure out a way to buy it,\u201d Schwartz says. It\u2019s a testament to the uniqueness of the building that, in a city where every move is like a tiny death, Shapton, Julavits and Santangelo were willing to agree to a lease of just a year.There\u2019s that old New York fear of dying alone in an apartment, forgotten by everyone. The Frosts, for all their eccentricities, had an instinct for the kinds of creative people who might establish a community, maybe something approximating a family, even for them. Schwartz initially resisted the idea of photographing their apartment for this story; he worried that it might be a betrayal of this exceedingly private couple. But then he reconsidered. \u201cMaybe it can also be a sweet memorial to the Frosts, who might otherwise have gone unnoticed,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we all want to leave a little bit of a happy mark on those around us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Business Deal and a Murder, Seen Through the Rearview Mirror", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byWESTFORD, Mass. \u2014 A silver 2006 Toyota 4Runner. Mint condition. Only 12,000 miles on the odometer. This is what the car dealer in East Providence, R.I., had to offer an up-and-coming star with the New England Patriots when he arrived at the lot in 2010.There\u2019s a long tradition of businessmen hooking up with professional athletes for an exchange of goods \u2014 a quid pro quo for tickets, access to social outings, memorabilia. In this case, the car dealer, Jack Fox, would receive tickets to Patriots games and signed jerseys and footballs, and the player would make promotional appearances for the dealership.It seemed like the beginning of a good relationship. The player traded texts with Mr. Fox regularly and kept up his end of the bargain.\u201cEvery once in a while, out of the blue, he would send me a text telling me what was going on in his life and how things were,\u201d Mr. Fox said.Mr. Fox, 64, came to think he might in some way be filling a void in the player\u2019s life from the death of his father several years earlier. He visited the player\u2019s apartment, and met his fianc\u00e9e and his uncle.The only problem in the first two years was getting the player to bring in the vehicle for regular servicing. At one point, the player called the dealership in a panic because the car wouldn\u2019t start. Mr. Fox dispatched a service employee to the player\u2019s apartment. The car was out of gas.In May 2012, about 21 months since he had taken possession of the vehicle, the player brought it to Mr. Fox for what would be its last servicing. He had put nearly 38,000 miles on it.The player soon stopped communicating with Mr. Fox. Calls inquiring about service or a trade-in went unreturned.Mr. Fox tried a more personal approach, sending one of his salesmen to Gillette Stadium to see if the player would be interested in switching to a newer car. The player declined.The reason, Mr. Fox eventually discovered, was that the vehicle had been involved in a double murder in Boston in July 2012. The player was Aaron Hernandez, whom the authorities accused of shooting two men while inside the 4Runner as the two victims sat in their car at a stoplight.\u201cEarly on, I had gotten a call from a Boston detective asking me if I had seen the car,\u201d Mr. Fox said. \u201cI told him I hadn\u2019t. He said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever see it again. We\u2019ve been looking for it and we can\u2019t find it.\u2019\u201dIn June 2013, after receiving a tip, the police finally found the 4Runner, stashed in the garage of Mr. Hernandez\u2019s uncle\u2019s house in Bristol, Conn. They impounded it. That was the same week that Mr. Hernandez was arrested in a separate case, the murder of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Mr. Hernandez\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Mr. Lloyd\u2019s body had been found nine days earlier.Mr. Hernandez was indicted in the double murder in May 2014. Months earlier, in September 2013, Mr. Fox had testified in that case for 20 minutes before a Suffolk County grand jury. He testified again at the trial, seeing Mr. Hernandez for the first time since the tight end had made an appearance at a dinner at Kirkbrae Country Club in Lincoln, R.I., for the parts and services employees.\u201cHe was terrific that night, too,\u201d Mr. Fox said. \u201cHe took pictures with everyone. He talked to the kitchen staff. He was great. He certainly didn\u2019t act like someone who might be arrested for murder.\u201dSeven months after the dinner, Mr. Hernandez was arrested and charged with Mr. Lloyd\u2019s murder. He was convicted in April 2015. Ten months later, Mr. Fox\u2019s lawyer petitioned the court to release the vehicle. The prosecution agreed, but Mr. Hernandez\u2019s new defense team objected. The car would stay impounded for another 15 months.This month a jury hearing the double-murder case acquitted Mr. Hernandez, who was already serving a life sentence in the murder of Mr. Lloyd. Five days after the acquittal, Mr. Hernandez was found dead in his prison cell, an apparent suicide.Two days later, a tow truck showed up at an evidence management facility in the Hyde Park section of Boston. That is where the 4Runner had been impounded since 2013. The vehicle was taken to a used-car dealership here in Westford, where it now sits in a garage next to a vintage black 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air and two Hondas in for repair.Mr. Fox finally saw the car the day after it arrived in Westford. Having decided that he and the 4Runner had too much shared history, he gave it to an old friend, Buddy Clair, the owner of the Westford dealership.Mr. Fox even threw in an autographed Hernandez jersey.Mr. Clair has agreed to sell the car, and to divide the proceeds with Mr. Fox. \u201cI think I\u2019ll put it on eBay and see what happens,\u201d Mr. Clair said. \u201cIn this day and age, you never know what someone might be willing to pay.\u201dThe vehicle\u2019s side-view mirrors are damaged and dangling from their casings. But over all, it is in excellent condition, considering.The odometer reads 53,337. The right front tire needs a little air. And the leather interior is clean and the carpets vacuumed, though there remains a small amount of residue from the long-ago dusting for fingerprints.Advertisement"}
