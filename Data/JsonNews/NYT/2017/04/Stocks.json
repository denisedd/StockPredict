{"Headline": "K.K.R. Finds an Activist at Its Gates", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsSome three decades after Henry Kravis was called a barbarian, he has encountered one at his own gate. Jeffrey W. Ubben, whose ValueAct Capital just disclosed an interest in Mr. Kravis\u2019s buyout shop, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, is usually friendlier in his approach with the companies in which he invests than the term might suggest. Even so, there is a chance things could get testy.Mason Morfit, president of Mr. Ubben\u2019s $16 billion activist investing firm, said on Thursday that he saw plenty of upside for K.K.R., whose funds own stakes in companies including First Data, GoDaddy, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Lyft. He reckons the firm\u2019s traded units are undervalued by half.Mr. Ubben is also considered politer than many of his aggressive ilk. With an interest of less than 5 percent, he is not required to say if he plans to make suggestions about how K.K.R. should run its business differently or if it is just a passive holding. And the firm\u2019s partnership structure insulates Mr. Kravis and his colleagues from being pushed around anyway.Bullish perspectives like Mr. Morfit\u2019s have fallen on deaf ears for a long time, though. Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group, suggested last week that if his firm\u2019s units were valued the same way as a typical Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index company\u2019s shares based on dividend yield, they would be trading at $100 each instead of $30.One reason Blackstone, K.K.R. and others aren\u2019t analyzed the way most other big public companies are, however, is that their complex structures are designed to help minimize taxes and keep founders and employees in control. Turning these partnerships into more typical corporations \u2014 something discussed off and on for years and possibly of interest to Mr. Ubben, according to a Bloomberg report \u2014 would probably invite new investors and higher valuations.A sharply reduced business tax rate, as proposed by President Trump, could revive the idea. A company\u2019s income would be taxed at a far lower rate than the personal rate many investors pay now on the profit passed through by K.K.R. and others. The Citigroup analyst William Katz estimated last year that while K.K.R.\u2019s earnings would fall by nearly a fifth at a 22.5 percent tax rate, the firm should also trade at a notably higher valuation.That is no certainty, however. And once a publicly traded partnership converts, it cannot easily go back. Any discussions between Mr. Ubben and Mr. Kravis may remain cordial only for so long.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Finding Growth in Pizza, Paint and Credit-Card Companies", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byGrowth stocks \u2014 those whose earnings are expected to grow faster than average \u2014 surged in the first quarter. They carried with them the managers of several of the quarter\u2019s top-performing stock funds.Those managers grabbed onto that growth in expected sorts of companies, like Alphabet and Facebook, and in more surprising and mature ones like MasterCard, Domino\u2019s and Sherwin-Williams.The funds are also unified by a philosophy, Mr. Lynch said.\u201cWhat we do is try to buy good growth companies and own them for many years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look very different from any benchmark. We have differentiated holdings, and we take concentrated positions. And with that, comes some volatility.\u201d Shares of Amazon and Facebook, for example, each accounted for about 9 percent of the Growth fund\u2019s assets at the end of February.Morningstar\u2019s numbers bear out Mr. Lynch\u2019s points. The three funds\u2019 turnover ratios, indicating the percentage of holdings sold annually, are below average, while their risk ratings are above. Put differently, the funds tend to trade less than average, but their returns tend to roller-coaster more than the indexes they\u2019re benchmarked against.A characteristic shared by many of the funds\u2019 holdings is that they can be tough to pigeonhole in a conventional investment sector, like technology or health care, Mr. Lynch said. \u201cIf there\u2019s not an easy category or comparison, then the company is more likely unique,\u201d he said.Take Alphabet, the holding company for Google. Many people call it a tech company, but it makes its money from advertising, which would traditionally point to media. \u201cThey used the internet to create a large audience and then disrupted the advertising world,\u201d he said.The largest and, in the most recent quarter, best performing of the three Morgan Stanley funds was the Growth fund. The fund, whose A shares carry an expense ratio of 0.96 percent, returned 16.25 percent for the quarter, compared with 5.5 percent for the S.&P. 500-stock index.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to identify two to three dozen high-growth companies whose stocks have little to do with one another,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then let that growth germinate. We\u2019re trying to invest in companies for three or four years.\u201dAnother point of emphasis is ensuring the returns of the fund\u2019s investments are not correlated with one another. The managers do that by using both statistical screens and fundamental analyses of how businesses may interact in unexpected ways, Mr. Galvin said. It is also one of the reasons they limit the portfolio\u2019s size. After about 35 stocks, he said, correlations in stock prices start to rise. \u201cEither the companies are competing with each other, or they\u2019re impacted by the same macroeconomic trends,\u201d he said.One of the qualities that drew Mr. Galvin and his colleagues to Domino\u2019s, the pizza delivery chain, was that its size and strong financials have enabled it to invest heavily in technology. And that has differentiated it from independent pizza peddlers, he said.\u201cThe digital divide is finally separating them from the mom-and-pop operators,\u201d he said. \u201cWith digital, you tap the app and have a pizza delivered, along with other menu items. Local operators don\u2019t have the financial wherewithal to invest in that kind of technology.\u201dMr. Galvin and his team divide their holdings into two groups: established companies, like Domino\u2019s, and emerging ones, like biotechnology outfits. The former \u201cprovide ballast to the portfolio,\u201d and the latter, opportunities for outsized returns, he said.\u201cWhen you have about half the portfolio in each of those, it blends out at an 18 to 22 percent level\u201d of average earnings growth, he said.The Columbia fund, whose A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.08 percent, returned 15.6 percent in the first quarter.\u201cI was just trading too much, and I didn\u2019t think I was that good at trading,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m doing good work, I should recognize mistakes, but I should also let the ideas develop.\u201d That means selling when he\u2019s sure an investment has gone bad but also hanging on through down periods if he is confident in a company\u2019s plans and prospects.Like any growth manager, Mr. Weiner hunts for strong, sustainable earnings growth. That has led him to put more than a third of the portfolio in technology stocks, like Facebook and Amazon. But it can also lead him into less obvious plays like the paint company Sherwin-Williams.\u201cThe paint-store business is huge and consistent and grows nicely year in and year out,\u201d he said. Sherwin-Williams caters to professional painters, and they\u2019re loyal in return. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go to Home Depot,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want 30-day terms.\u201d That is, they want to finance purchases for a month, rather than paying upfront.The business has pricing power, too, he said. The actual paint is a small enough portion of the cost of most paint jobs that the final consumer is not that sensitive to changes in price. \u201cPeople hire a painter and get a quote and have no idea what the cost of paint is in the quote,\u201d Mr. Weiner said.The Growth Discovery Fund, with an expense ratio of 0.78 percent, returned 12.15 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ford Foundation Is an Unlikely Convert to \u2018Impact\u2019 Investing", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byCommon SensePeter A. Nadosy is a pillar of the Wall Street establishment \u2014 he spent 27 years at Morgan Stanley, rising to vice chairman. He served a stint managing the endowment at Harvard, his alma mater, and he\u2019s also a life trustee and member of the investment committee at Amherst College. He\u2019s on multiple boards of nonprofit institutions, including the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and St. Andrew\u2019s Dune Church in Southampton, N.Y.He is, in short, about the last person you\u2019d expect to throw his support behind an investment strategy that makes fossil-fuel divestment \u2014 something Mr. Nadosy opposes \u2014 look tame by comparison. Yet, as chairman of the Ford Foundation\u2019s investment committee, which oversees the foundation\u2019s $12 billion-plus endowment, he\u2019s now in the vanguard of an approach to endowment management that breaks with generations of investment orthodoxy.Last week, the foundation announced that it would commit $1 billion to investments that \u201cearn not only attractive financial returns but concrete social returns as well,\u201d as it said in a news release.\u201cWhen we first started talking about this nine months ago, I was very wary,\u201d Mr. Nadosy told me. \u201cI\u2019m on 10 different boards and investment committees. It\u2019s deeply ingrained that your goal is to maximize returns, because that\u2019s how performance is measured.\u201d\u201cEverywhere I go, people want to know, \u2018What quartile are you in?\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cLike it or not, that\u2019s the world we live in.\u201dEarning high returns isn\u2019t just a matter of bragging rights \u2014 endowment income supports the missions of nonprofit institutions, whether education, as with college and universities, or broader social programs, as at many private foundations. By law, tax-exempt foundations must spend at least 5 percent of their endowment every year on charitable purposes. In Ford\u2019s case, that amounts to over $600 million.If endowment returns do not exceed the 5 percent annual spending rate, they will gradually wither, and can eventually disappear, which is why many investment committees view protecting endowments as a near-sacred duty. That\u2019s the main reason the student-led movement for fossil-fuel divestment has gotten such a cold shoulder at many large endowments.But for Darren Walker, the Ford Foundation\u2019s president, it was a source of mounting frustration that, as he told me last week, \u201cwe\u2019ve spent the past 50 years trying to maximize the impact of 5 percent of our assets, but what about the other 95 percent.\u201d And some of that was invested in assets that, whatever returns they may have generated, were anathema to the values of the foundation itself.\u201cWe can responsibly steward our assets while finding a path toward more transformational impact,\u201d he wrote.Ford hasn\u2019t invested its endowment in any social-impact ventures yet, but said it would focus on affordable housing in the United States and access to financial services in emerging markets.Ford is not the first to embrace the approach, widely known as mission-related investment, or impact investing. Pioneers in the strategy, albeit on a smaller scale, include the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Kresge Foundation, the McKnight Foundation, the F. B. Heron Foundation, the Wallace Global Fund, the Surdna Foundation, Omidyar Network, and the Open Society Foundations.The movement gained fresh impetus when the Obama administration, in its waning days, said explicitly that trustees would not violate their fiduciary obligations or jeopardize their tax-exempt status if they authorized investments in \u201cmission-related businesses.\u201d (Whether the Trump administration will embrace that interpretation remains to be seen: When I checked this week, that policy statement had been deleted from the White House website.)\u201cNot to malign Wall Street,\u201d Mr. Nadosy said, \u201cbut when they smell a profit opportunity, you have to be careful.\u201dMr. Walker had his work cut out for him to convince Ford\u2019s own investment staff and board.Mr. Nadosy said his previous experiences with mission-related investments were disappointing. \u201cI\u2019m on two boards where clean technology and pollution are big issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe invested in some ventures going back five or six years. They\u2019ve been money-losers, by and large. They were good people and good ideas, but they haven\u2019t worked out.\u201dNonetheless, as he immersed himself in the issues, he gradually came around to Mr. Walker\u2019s view that the be-all and end-all of a foundation\u2019s work shouldn\u2019t be to increase the endowment. \u201cIf we can invest in ways that support the mission and purpose of the foundation, and still earn a decent return, why not try?\u201d he said. He said he expected these mission-related investments to underperform Ford\u2019s more traditional approach, but nonetheless, \u201cthe social good should more than offset that.\u201dHe stressed that Ford had built numerous safeguards into the effort, such as investing the $1 billion in phases. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about 8 percent of the portfolio over 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter Year 2 or 3, if it doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll slow down. If it goes well, we can go ahead even faster.\u201dHis support proved critical for mustering board support. It\u2019s \u201cnot a hidebound conservative board by any stretch,\u201d Mr. Nadosy said. Still, \u201cthis was difficult. We talked a lot and, quite frankly, it took some work.\u201d (The board includes Gabrielle Sulzberger, who is married to Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of The New York Times.)Given Ford\u2019s size and prominence, its move is likely to generate a wave of new mission-related investment. In his letter, Mr. Walker called on endowments of all kinds, including pension funds, sovereign-wealth funds and university endowments, to get on the bandwagon and \u201chelp capital markets become accelerators of justice.\u201d\u201cThe Ford move is very significant,\u201d said Jessica Matthews, head of mission-related investment at Cambridge Associates, a large investment advisory firm with many foundation and university clients. Last year, Cambridge surveyed its nonprofit clients, and nearly one-third of those who responded said they were using endowments to make mission-related investments. Of that group, 62 percent said they expected to increase their commitment over the next five years.Ms. Matthews said that it was too soon and the database still too small to produce a reliable measure of returns, but that \u201cthe good news we\u2019re seeing is there are bright spots,\u201d with some social impact investments performing very well.Not everyone is rushing to follow Ford\u2019s example. \u201cI congratulate them and look forward to seeing how they do,\u201d said Vartan Gregorian, president of Carnegie Corporation of New York, but he said the foundation would adhere to its traditional approach, which has served its mission well over its 106-year history.He noted that the founder, Andrew Carnegie, as a businessman, expected the endowment to earn a profit and exist in perpetuity. With an endowment now over $3 billion, Carnegie Corporation has been better able to serve its mission by increasing its annual philanthropic grant making. Investments, by contrast, generate \u201cfinancial pressure for returns,\u201d he said.Still, \u201cwe\u2019ll be watching to see if there\u2019s anything we can learn\u201d from Ford\u2019s approach, Mr. Gregorian said.Mr. Walker said he realized he was breaking with decades of conventional wisdom about endowment management, but felt that impact investing had reached \u201can inflection point.\u201d\u201cIn time, I fervently believe, we will see a thriving, mature sector in which everyone can make impact investments that produce both sustainable financial returns and substantial social returns,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMaybe it will take decades more to get there. But we\u2019ll never know if we don\u2019t make a start.\u201dMr. Nadosy is ready. \u201cI went from very skeptical to very excited,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you take a little more risk, and maybe get a slightly lower return. Why not? The goal is to help people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Our Climate Future Is Actually Our Climate Present", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "The Climate IssueHow do we live with the fact that the world we knew is going and, in some cases, already gone?Supported byThe map wasn\u2019t science; it didn\u2019t even pretend to be. I want to be very clear about that, because I worry it\u2019s reckless to inject any more false facts into a conversation about climate change. Projecting the effect of sea-level rise on a specific location typically involves recondite computer models and calculations; Burrito Justice was just a fascinated hobbyist, futzing around on his laptop in his backyard. His entire premise was unscientific; for now, it is unthinkable that seas will rise so high so quickly. Even as most credible scientific estimates keep increasing and the poles melt faster than imagined, those estimates currently reach only between six and eight feet by the year 2100. That\u2019s still potentially cataclysmic: Water would push into numerous cities, like Shanghai, London and New York, and displace hundreds of millions of people. And yes, there are some fringe, perfect-storm thought experiments out there that can get you close to 200 feet by the end of the century. But in truth, Burrito Justice settled on that number only because that\u2019s how high he needed to jack up the world\u2019s oceans if he wanted to wash out a particular road near his house. He has a friendly rivalry with another blogger, who lives in an adjacent neighborhood known for being a cloistered hamlet, and Burrito Justice thought it would be funny to see it literally become an island. So again: The map wasn\u2019t science. It didn\u2019t pretend to be. The point, initially, was just to needle this other guy named Todd.Still, the San Francisco Archipelago has always stuck with me, because, almost in spite of itself, it managed to convey something peculiar and destabilizing about our climatological future. Burrito Justice hadn\u2019t just redrawn the geography of a place; he\u2019d also carried a sense of that place forward in time. And by transposing some of the grit and silly shibboleths of contemporary city life onto that alternate landscape, the map (and the little blog posts he wrote to accompany it) prodded you to entertain the possibility that this ruined future might not feel like an emergency to those living it, that life in that archipelago might have all the richness, realness and inanity of ours.There were, most obviously, the breezy, optimistic names given to every new feature of the redrawn city, as though its ever-peppy real estate agents had gone on rebranding neighborhoods as the landscape drowned. Climate change, in this scenario, had more in common with gentrification than with a natural disaster: a ceaseless upheaval of familiar spaces that left old-timers shaking their heads, then kept accelerating. Instead of Telegraph Hill rising north of Market Street downtown, Telegraph Island now offered a tranquil view of Market Shoals. Dolores Park was gone. But Cape Dolores jutted toward it, overlooking the submerged Mission District \u2014 now Mission Gulf. The former San Francisco Zoo, out at Ocean Beach, was labeled San Francisco Aquarium.Life went on, in other words \u2014 albeit in some bleak and greatly diminished capacity. Taco boats replaced taco trucks, the public-transit agency\u2019s \u201csea bus\u201d system exaggerated its on-time performance statistics and the city government was offering to extend the notorious tax break it offered Twitter in 2011 if the tech company relocated to \u201cdisadvantaged Nob Island.\u201d The only people who remembered us, or validated our earlier reality, came off as loopy, Nimby activists aiming to obstruct development on one of the new coasts. \u201cOld San Francisco is still alive in our hearts and minds,\u201d a statement from the Submerged Historic San Francisco Preservation Association insists, \u201ceven if only the tops of the buildings can be seen!\u201dThe map was a joke. But the longer I looked at it, the less funny and more upsetting it got. I pictured the first apartment my wife and I rented in San Francisco, how I\u2019d parked the car out front while, just home from the hospital, she carried our first baby up the stairs. Then I pictured that all under water, and a man pushing off in his kayak for a paddle far overhead.We\u2019re accustomed to hearing about the tragically straightforward cases of island nations that will simply disappear: countries like Tuvalu and Kiribati that face the possibility of having to broker the wholesale resettlement of their people in other countries. Yet there must also be, in any corner of the planet, and for each human living on it, a threshold at which a familiar place becomes an unfamiliar one: an altered atmosphere, inundated by differentness and weirdness, in which, on some level, we\u2019ll live on, in exile. The Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht describes this feeling as \u201csolastalgia\u201d: \u201ca form of homesickness one gets when one is still at \u2018home.\u2019\u2009\u201dSome communities will face new problems and varieties of weather; in others, existing ones will intensify. Already-vulnerable societies \u2014 the poor, the poorly governed \u2014 may be stressed to grim breaking points. Consider the mass starvation in South Sudan, Nigeria, Yemen and Somalia, where a total of nearly a million and a half children are predicted to die this year \u2014 and that climate change is projected to worsen the kind of droughts that caused it. Consider, too, a 2015 Department of Defense report, which framed climate change as a geopolitical \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d that will \u201cthreaten domestic stability in a number of countries,\u201d and cited a study showing how a five-year drought in Syria contributed to the outbreak of the current conflict there. Nonetheless, denial is coming back in fashion among the most powerful. We have a president who dismisses climate change as a hoax, and a budget director who belittles government programs to study and adapt to our new reality as a \u201cwaste of your money.\u201dA University of British Columbia fisheries scientist, Daniel Pauly, hit upon essentially the same idea around the same time, recognizing that as populations of large fish collapsed, humanity had gone on obliviously fishing slightly smaller species. One result, Pauly wrote, was a \u201ccreeping disappearance\u201d of overall fish stocks behind ever-changing and \u201cinappropriate reference points.\u201d He called this impaired vision \u201cshifting baseline syndrome.\u201dThere are, however, many subtler shifts in our awareness that can\u2019t be as precisely demarcated. Scenarios that might sound dystopian or satirical as broad-strokes future projections unassumingly materialize as reality. Last year, melting permafrost in Siberia released a strain of anthrax, which had been sealed in a frozen reindeer carcass, sickening 100 people and killing one child. In July 2015, during the hottest month ever recorded on earth (until the following year), and the hottest day ever recorded in England (until the following summer), the Guardian newspaper had to shut down its live-blogging of the heat wave when the servers overheated. And low-lying cities around the world are experiencing increased \u201cclear-sky flooding,\u201d in which streets or entire neighborhoods are washed out temporarily by high tides and storm surges. Parts of Washington now experience flooding 30 days a year, a figure that has roughly quadrupled since 1960. In Wilmington, N.C., the number is 90 days. But scientists and city planners have conjured a term of art that defuses that astonishing reality: \u201cnuisance flooding,\u201d they call it.Kahn calls our environmental generational amnesia \u201cone of the central psychological problems of our lifetime,\u201d because it obscures the magnitude of so many concrete problems. You can wind up not looking away, exactly, but zoomed in too tightly to see things for what they are. Still, the tide is always rising in the background, swallowing something. And the longer you live, the more anxiously trapped you may feel between the losses already sustained and the ones you see coming.Sure, I told him, but at some point it would all be too much. Potentially, Kahn said. But assumptions about the future, no matter how self-evident they may feel, don\u2019t automatically come true. \u201cThe amazing thing is that none of this seems to work the way we think it should. When I was growing up in the Bay Area in the 1970s, the traffic was really bad. And I said, If it just gets a little bit worse, you\u2019re going to have a major upheaval in consciousness. And every five years it got worse.\u201d He went silent for a second, then continued, \u201cI\u2019m just thinking about how many five-year periods I\u2019ve lived through.\u201dAs Burrito Justice described this to me on the phone one recent afternoon, I thought of a woman in San Francisco named Pamela Buttery, whom I\u2019d heard about on National Public Radio in January. Buttery owned a condo in the Millennium Tower, a waterfront skyscraper downtown. But the tower had started sinking at an irregular angle, even before its completion in 2010; by now, it has tilted six inches and sunk a foot into the hodgepodge Victorian landfill on which it was constructed. Buttery lived on the 57th floor. \u201cI\u2019ve moved on into a depression about it,\u201d she said. Though she used to unwind by putting golf balls, the reporter noted that even this didn\u2019t \u201cgive her the same joy it once did. No matter which way she hits them, they all end up in the same corner.\u201d And I realized that if someone in 1853 had tried to anticipate the texture and oddities of future life in his artificially expanding city, and imagined a woman who can\u2019t satisfactorily putt golf balls on the 57th floor because her luxury condo is sinking into old garbage \u2014 well, I probably would have bought a copy of that guy\u2019s map, too.The future is always somebody else\u2019s present \u2014 it will very likely feel as authentic, and only as horrific, as our moment does to us. But the present is also somebody else\u2019s future: We are already standing on someone else\u2019s ludicrous map. Except none of us are in on the joke, and I\u2019m guessing that it won\u2019t feel funny any time soon.Jon Mooallem is a writer at large for the magazine and the author of the book \u201cWild Ones.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even after three robust years of growth, there are no signs of tapering in any way.The stellar quarter also explains why BlackRock\u2019s chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, has decided to bet the firm\u2019s future on systematic styles of investing that deploy machine-driven formulas as opposed to the classic model of relying on individual portfolio managers to pick stocks as a way of beating the market index.\u201cAssets are up 14 percent; revenue and operating income are also up,\u201d Mr. Fink said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThe quarter was a pretty complete statement that our business model is working.\u201dMr. Fink, who in recent years has been pushing BlackRock to invest more deeply in every form of technology, also highlighted the continued growth of Aladdin, the firm\u2019s risk management system that other institutions pay BlackRock a fee to use.Aladdin revenues grew 12 percent for the quarter.Perhaps more than any other quarter, these last three months defined Mr. Fink\u2019s future vision of his company: Investment styles that rely on actively managed strategies saw outflows of $1.8 billion while all passive funds (index and E.T.F.s) attracted inflows of $82.1 billion.A telling 64 percent of the firm\u2019s assets under management are now in passive-focused index and exchange-traded funds, with just 29 percent in funds that follow active strategies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Job Growth Loses Steam as U.S. Adds 98,000 in March", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byLooking for a Trump bump in the economy? Keep waiting.After two months of stellar job creation that convinced administration officials that President Trump\u2019s policies were paying off immediately, employers pulled back sharply on hiring in March.The economy added 98,000 jobs, the Labor Department reported Friday, fewer than half the monthly number for January and February.The report contained some notable good news: The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, the lowest level in almost a decade and a milestone in the long road back from the Great Recession. The rate was 4.7 percent in February. Wages also continued to rise.But the disappointing number of new jobs was jarring for the administration, and well below what economists had expected. It comes as the stock market surge, which followed the November election, subsides and amid signs that economic growth in the year\u2019s first quarter proves weak.Economic perceptions, as well, may not be playing out in reality. Sentiment among consumers and businesses rose after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, but so far, it has not been matched by a comparable increase in spending by either group.\u201cWe\u2019ve given up on waiting for hard data to improve,\u201d said Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays. \u201cIt\u2019s been five months since confidence increased. If consumption were going to improve, it would have already.\u201dIndustries that Mr. Trump emphasized in his campaign \u2014 particularly manufacturing \u2014 continued to add jobs last month, but at a slower pace. Payrolls in the retail sector, meanwhile, declined further, shedding tens of thousands of jobs.The response from the White House, which crowed last month after more than 200,000 jobs were produced in Mr. Trump\u2019s first full month in office, was muted Friday.Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive who is director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, emphasized the decline in the unemployment rate. \u201cWhen you look at the jobs report as a whole, I think there\u2019s an awful lot of good news in here,\u201d he told Fox Business Network. Congressional Democrats took a dimmer view.Also watching closely are the policy makers of the Federal Reserve, which has begun to reel in its post-recession stimulus. It raised interest rates last month and said it planned to do so twice more this year. But signs of a sluggish economy could affect how quickly the central bank moves.\u201cThis raises the stakes for the April report,\u201d said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a research firm. \u201cYou need to see things pick up in April, or else March won\u2019t look like aberration.\u201dThe market reaction, in any case, was sanguine, with stocks essentially flat for the day.Barclays has said it expects the economy to actually slow in the first half of 2017, before rebounding modestly in the second half. \u201cGiven this data today, we see downside risk in our already soft expectations for the first half,\u201d Mr. Martin said.The consensus view on Wall Street is that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 1 percent last quarter, with the pace of growth in the current second quarter rising to 3.5 percent.The March report represents a snapshot of the economy, not an oil painting. And snow and cold weather in many parts of the country clearly took a toll on the construction sector, which barely grew after gaining a total of more than 90,000 jobs in January and February.\u201cJanuary and February were abnormally warm, so they were pumped up, and you had some payback in March exacerbated by the harsh weather,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said.On Capitol Hill, Republicans acknowledged a glass-half-full view of the report. \u201cThe economy clearly should be generating higher job growth,\u201d said Representative Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. \u201cHowever, the unemployment rate fell to the lowest rate since before the recession.\u201dThe top Democrat on the committee, Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, ignored the new jobless rate and focused instead on the disappointing payroll gain.\u201cToday\u2019s jobs numbers show there are still challenges ahead that this administration must address,\u201d Mr. Heinrich said. \u201cPresident Trump promised that he would be \u2018the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.\u2019 Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee will hold him to this promise.\u201dPart of the problem for the administration is that its legislative accomplishments in the first hundred days are falling far short of the expectations \u2014 notably, for tax cuts and infrastructure spending \u2014 since the election.Whether or not they support Mr. Trump, mainstream economists say it will take many months for policy shifts in Washington to move a battleship-like economy with 153 million workers.What is more, the tepid numbers for March mask pockets of strength. For example, a few white-collar sectors like professional and business services are holding up well, adding 56,000 jobs last month.Hyland, a business software designer in Westlake, Ohio, plans to hire at least 300 people this year, Bill Priemer, its chief executive, said. That is a 15 percent increase in head count at the company, and it is a sign of just how quickly demand is growing for new technologies like content management, one of Hyland\u2019s specialties.\u201cWe are growing faster than the economy and the enterprise software sector overall,\u201d Mr. Priemer said. \u201cDigital transformation is a big buzzword, but it\u2019s just fancy terminology to describe how business can use technology to streamline their operations.\u201dOn the other hand, new technologies are upending venerable industries like retailing, as consumers shift to shopping online and department stores close. The retail sector lost almost 30,000 jobs last month, after a decline of about 31,000 in February.The headline numbers for hiring and the unemployment rate are derived from separate surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one of establishments, the other of households. Although the two tends to converge over time, they can vary widely from month to month, and March was one of those times.So while businesses showed an anemic gain of 98,000 jobs in terms of payrolls, households reported a 472,000 increase in employment, without any fall in labor participation. That explains why the unemployment rate could fall by 0.2 of a percentage point, even as the number for job creation was far short of expectations.\u201cI think the headline number was clearly impacted by the weather,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But at some point she said, rosy economic expectations are likely to catch up with a more sober reality.\u201cSentiment surveys moved sharply higher after the election on expectations of pro-business policies and tax reform,\u201d she added. \u201cSo far, that hasn\u2019t happened, and the big question is whether confidence can remain as strong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mutual Funds Buy Hot Stocks Like Snap Ahead of I.P.O.s", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported bySnap acquired loads of new investors when it went public last month, including people who own mutual funds that bought shares. But while the stock had just been listed for trading, those new owners were not the first fund investors with a stake in the image messaging service.They were beaten to it by shareholders of about two dozen mutual funds, including several run by Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, that held pieces of Snap going back at least to last June, according to Morningstar. The practice of purchasing privately traded equities is fairly common among large fund companies, albeit usually in small amounts relative to their assets.With positions so modest, private-firm equity purchases may hardly be worth talking about, except that the companies that funds invest in are often the sort that get talked about: buzz-worthy tech stocks with highly anticipated initial public offerings, such as Facebook in 2012, Twitter the year after that and Snap most recently.The next crop of next big things to go public may include the ride service Uber, the biggest object of private-firm equity investment cited in the Morningstar study, and the service Airbnb.Buying ahead of the crowd carries great reward potential but also significant risks, analysts and fund managers say. It\u2019s a useful way to gain access to tomorrow\u2019s hot stocks today, as long as it\u2019s done in amounts that are small enough to keep participants from getting burned if something goes awry and the crowd fails to show up.\u201cBeing early to the table can benefit fund owners,\u201d said Katie Reichart, associate director of equity strategies research at Morningstar and the study\u2019s author. \u201cFunds can buy into a company at a much lower valuation.\u201d Highlighting the main drawback, she added, \u201cIt might not go public or fizzle out.\u201dWith no liquid market to continually set prices, it\u2019s hard for funds or their shareholders to know what a private company is worth at any moment. This can result in stale pricing, or a valuation based on a stock\u2019s last trade that occurred so long ago that it can no longer be considered an accurate gauge of its worth. At times when investors are dumping stocks across the board, there could be no one to take a privately held stock off a portfolio manager\u2019s hands, ultimately leading to a total write-off.Even if a stock goes public eventually, owning it can create difficulties, Ms. Reichart said. If a fund must sell stocks to meet redemption requests, for example, there may be no choice but to sell publicly traded issues that the manager would rather keep, causing private-firm equity to become an undesirably large proportion of total assets.A successful public offering and further gains thereafter, on the other hand, can produce returns many times as great as a fund\u2019s initial investment. The prospect of getting a piece of such a stock early and making a huge score explains why private companies are sometimes called unicorns.To try to strike the right risk/reward balance, funds generally invest after a company has established a history of generating solid and growing revenues. Once a position appears to be meeting a manager\u2019s expectations, further capital is likely to be invested, before or after the hoped-for public stock sale.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find something we can continue to buy and make a bigger portion of our funds,\u201d said Andy Boyd, the head of global equity capital markets at Fidelity, the largest private-firm equity investor by far, with stakes totaling roughly $5 billion across several funds, according to Morningstar.While noting that \u201cevery great investment starts small,\u201d Mr. Boyd stressed that Fidelity will not invest in anything too small. The company will buy into private businesses \u201cif they\u2019re at a size and scale that makes sense for us, not two guys in a garage.\u201d That typically means \u201cat the very end of their private life, before they become public.\u201dHe declined to offer specific return figures, but he said that \u201cas a group these have been highly profitable for our shareholders\u201d and \u201coverall we outperform the market.\u201dThe private companies in which Fidelity holds large stakes include Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and WeWork. It had owned Facebook and Snap privately, but not Twitter.Nine Fidelity funds and 11 Price funds were among the 23 in the Morningstar study that had stakes in Snap. The other three funds were Optimum Large Cap Growth, Principal LargeCap Growth and Valic Company I Science & Technology.These investments produced annualized returns of 59.5 percent from September 2009 through 2016, Mr. Ellenbogen said. The rest of the private holdings have returned 5.1 percent a year.Owning private-firm equity can produce other, less immediately tangible rewards, advocates contend. Investing in a private company allows a firm \u201cto know a management longer,\u201d Mr. Boyd said. \u201cWe want to get to know companies and understand their businesses.\u201dMs. Reichart at Morningstar cited other advantages, including an opportunity to own companies that are not components of benchmark indexes. That gives managers a chance to beat the returns of index funds, something that has been difficult in recent years.Private companies can also protect against disruptive changes in an industry, she said. Owning the next big thing is a useful hedge if you also own the current big thing that the upstart is trying to displace.Some large portfolio managers are not persuaded by such arguments and hold little or no private-firm equity. Massachusetts Financial Services, for example, has \u201cno explicit policy against investing privately on behalf of our funds,\u201d said Daniel Flaherty, a company spokesman, \u201cbut we have generally avoided private investments due to their higher risk profile.\u201dJPMorgan Chase, another of the 10 largest asset managers, does not invest in private companies, either, but a representative declined to offer reasons.Ed Sweeney, a spokesman for BlackRock, said his firm was a somewhat active owner of private companies three or four years ago, especially through its Global Allocation Fund, but lately managers have found valuations high, relative to those of public companies.\u201cWe were dabbling in this space across several funds, but over the last 18 months to two years, if not zero, it\u2019s very scaled back,\u201d he said.Dabbling in private-firm equity may be getting more difficult, according to one longtime practitioner. When unlisted companies sell shares, they are more likely to require the buyers not to trade them, said Kevin Landis, a Silicon Valley investment veteran and manager of the Firsthand Technology Value Fund, a closed-end vehicle for holding solely private companies.\u201cSince the Facebook I.P.O., the game has changed,\u201d Mr. Landis said. \u201cPrivate companies have gone back to the drawing board and instituted some changes that give them a lot more control over the movement of their stock. Companies like Uber have locked down trading and changed their shareholder agreements to make it virtually impossible to buy shares. We would have loved to buy shares of Uber, Airbnb or Snap two years ago, but they just weren\u2019t available.\u201dMs. Reichart reports \u201ca slight uptick\u201d in private-firm investment since mid-2016 but \u201cnot a major spike in the number of companies or average stakes.\u201dThe continued modest level of investment is good and bad news for shareholders. It gives them less to get excited about but less to get nervous about.If you\u2019re shopping around for a stock fund, \u201cit\u2019s important to understand if a fund is doing this in terms of your risk tolerance,\u201d Ms. Reichart said. \u201cAre you comfortable with that idea? In most cases funds are diversified and the positions are small. It\u2019s probably not worth panicking about, and you\u2019re probably not going to get blockbuster returns.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He is such a fan, in fact, that he has put down deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts once Tesla starts making the car later this year.He also owns some Tesla stock, but is not about to buy more.\u201cIt\u2019s a little pricey for me to jump back in,\u201d he said, speaking by phone from his Model S. \u201cRight now, I think we\u2019re in a hold.\u201dMoreover, he worries about Tesla\u2019s ability to carry out the bold expansion plans it has for this year and next. Tesla\u2019s high-profile chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the company expects to begin production this summer on its first mass-market offering, the Model 3, ramping up to 5,000 cars a month by the end of the year and driving output to several hundred thousand cars over the course of 2018.\u201cThey really need to deliver, and that has me concerned,\u201d Mr. Pascual said, who has worked at start-up companies and has years of experience in the technology business. \u201cI\u2019m bullish long term, but yes, I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m always worried about companies executing.\u201dTesla\u2019s market surge has been extraordinary. Since March 13, its shares are up 25 percent, in a period when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has declined slightly.Along the way, the market value of Tesla, which sold fewer than 80,000 cars last year and does not yet generate steady profits, has grown to $50 billion \u2014 roughly equal to that of General Motors, which sold more than 9.8 million vehicles worldwide and earned $9.4 billion. (On Tuesday, Tesla closed at $308.71, a decline of 1.2 percent, pushing it slightly below G.M. in market capitalization a day after surpassing it.)That Tesla and G.M. are comparably valued is \u201ctotally inexplicable,\u201d Michael J. Jackson, the chief executive of the dealership chain AutoNation, said on Tuesday at an auto-industry conference in New York. He added that Tesla \u201cis either one of the great Ponzi schemes of all time\u201d or will somehow work out for investors.The run-up was fueled in part by some encouraging signs that Tesla\u2019s Model 3 is proceeding on schedule. Early this year the company began production of batteries at its gigantic new plant in Nevada, known as the Gigafactory. Then it announced that Model 3 production would start in July, despite concerns among some analysts that the debut would be delayed until late this year.A smooth Model 3 rollout could propel Tesla to new heights. It has customer deposits of $1,000 for close to 400,000 orders of the new model, which is priced at $35,000, making it affordable to far more buyers than Tesla\u2019s existing models, which go for $90,000 with options.\u201cThe market seems to be thrilled,\u201d said David Whiston, an equity analyst at Morningstar. \u201cThe thinking seems to be that this could be the next Amazon or Apple, and people want to get in early.\u201dAdding to this enthusiasm seems to be a belief in Mr. Musk\u2019s vision of the future. He is trying to revolutionize the auto industry with Tesla, which has jumped ahead of traditional automakers in both battery-powered cars and self-driving technology. At the same time, he is promising to bring affordable renewable energy to homes with SolarCity, which merged with Tesla last year, and commercialize the heavens with SpaceX, a separate company he founded.Tesla, in Mr. Musk\u2019s view, is more than a carmaker. It is leading the shift to renewable energy \u2014 on the road and at home.While Mr. Musk\u2019s vision has captured the imagination of both car buyers and investors, the company\u2019s financial situation is less compelling. Tesla has reported losses in each of the past five years, and must invest heavily to achieve his goals. It had $3.4 billion in cash at the end of 2016, but some $7 billion in debt after the SolarCity acquisition. It has debt payments coming due in 2018, 2019 and 2021. Problems or delays in Model 3 production could make it harder to meet its obligations.\u201cRight now, nobody seems to care about balance-sheet risk,\u201d Mr. Whiston said. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t seem to be concerned about cash-flow risk. People are looking at the potential, and the old-fashioned analysis of fundamentals aren\u2019t seen as important.\u201dAnother question overshadowed by Tesla\u2019s stock surge is whether the company can make the big leap to making, shipping, selling and servicing a half a million cars a year \u2014 a fivefold increase in production of cars that are made out of thousands of parts and components.\u201cAll you need is a problem with one part to delay the Model 3,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book.Producing a half a million cars a year in one plant will not be easy even without such problems. Other car plants in the United States typically make only 200,000 to 300,000 vehicles a year.Pete Cordaro, the owner of a vending-machine company in Connellsville, Pa., drives a 2015 Model S and loves the car. Mr. Cordaro is such a fan, in fact, that he has put down deposits to buy two Model 3s once they are available.But the stock? He is not sold on it. He said he knew well from his own business how important a sound financial footing was.\u201cI think there\u2019s too much enthusiasm in the market like with any growth company,\u201d Mr. Cordaro said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bubble.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump and Warren Agree? Maybe, on Plan to Shrink Big Banks", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump has vowed to roll back financial regulation, saying that it is preventing banks from lending and businesses from growing.Wall Street, it would seem, has found its dream president.There is just one possible complication: His top advisers continue to float an idea that would not only hurt the nation\u2019s largest banks, it would upend them.In a meeting on Wednesday with senators from both parties, Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, said the administration was considering a proposal that would require separating retail banking from investment banking and trading. Mr. Cohn mentioned the idea to members of the Senate Banking Committee as one of several financial regulations on the table.The goal of Glass-Steagall was to prevent banks from taking risks with people\u2019s federally insured deposits.Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is arguably Wall Street\u2019s harshest critic on Capitol Hill, has said restoring Glass-Steagall would reduce the risks bank pose to the economy by creating a \u201cwall between commercial and investment banking.\u201d\u201cDespite the progress since 2008, the biggest banks continue to threaten our economy,\u201d Ms. Warren said in a statement.On Thursday, she seized on the news of Mr. Cohn\u2019s comments to reintroduce a bill that she sponsored with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, called the 21st-century Glass-Steagall Act.It was a rare moment of harmony between the Trump administration and Ms. Warren. They are even calling their proposals by the same name.\u201cThe president spoke to the need for a simplification of the banking system on the campaign trail, what he called a \u201821st century Glass-Steagall,\u2019 to make it easier for businesses to grow and create jobs in their communities,\u201d a White House spokeswoman said in a statement on Thursday.Since the Republican convention last July \u2014 when the restoration of Glass-Steagall was inserted into the party\u2019s platform \u2014 Mr. Trump has on occasion signaled a willingness to break up the big banks.The idea seems incongruent with the president\u2019s many other policies on taxes and the environment that will largely benefit corporations and the wealthy.Yet invoking Glass-Steagall, which was repealed in 1999, seems tailored to appeal directly to the angry voters who elected Mr. Trump.Many Americans are still smarting from the 2008 recession, which was caused by the financial crisis, and still believe that the Obama administration did not go far enough in reining in Wall Street.Still, it is unclear whether a return to Glass-Steagall is politically feasible.Banking lobbyists dismissed Mr. Cohn\u2019s comments as empty politics and ineffective policy.\u201cLarge financial institutions play a role in the American economy other institutions are not able to fill,\u201d said Tim Pawlenty, the chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry group, and a former Republican governor of Minnesota.Even regulators, who worry about the systemic risks posed by huge banks, say restoring Glass-Steagall is no cure-all.During the financial crisis, the failure of investment firms that had no major retail business \u2014 Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers \u2014 posed grave risks to the economy.\u201cGlass-Steagall by itself will not address \u2018too big to fail,\u2019\u201d said Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, who was a Treasury official during the financial crisis.Others warned that breaking up large banks could benefit firms like Mr. Cohn\u2019s former employer, Goldman Sachs, whose retail deposit business is relatively recent and small: It would have a greater impact on Goldman rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.Goldman, said Dennis Kelleher, president and chief executive of Better Markets, a group that advocates more restrictions on Wall Street, \u201cwould be king of the financial world where bank holding companies couldn\u2019t compete.\u201dIf anything, the proposal to restore Glass-Steagall shows the shifting sands of Wall Street\u2019s position in Washington.During the presidential campaign, Wall Street executives overwhelming supported Hillary Clinton, who was seen as a moderate on financial issues, someone who understood the important role that big banks play in the global economy.Mrs. Clinton said during the campaign that bringing back the law would not make the banks safer or eliminate the chance of another crisis like 2008.Glass-Steagall had been repealed during her husband\u2019s administration, ushering in an era of consolidation that created behemoth banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup that did everything from issuing auto loans to trading complex derivatives.Despite backing the Democrat, Wall Street has already benefited greatly from Mr. Trump\u2019s election.Stocks of banks like Bank of America and Citigroup, beaten down for years, have had their biggest rebound in recent memory \u2014 a rally driven in part by proposed regulatory relief. In particular, Mr. Trump has said he will be taking aim at the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, passed in the wake of the financial crisis, which contains a thicket of restrictions on trading and oversight.Banks are also hoping that Mr. Trump\u2019s appointments to important positions on the Federal Reserve will provide relief on how much capital they need to hold to cushion against losses.\u201cEssentially, too big to fail has been solved,\u201d Mr. Dimon wrote. \u201cTaxpayers will not pay if a bank fails.\u201dOne day later, talk of breaking up the big banks was back in vogue and the industry\u2019s regulatory fortunes seemed more uncertain than before.Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After French Vote, Mainstream Europe Breathes a Sigh of Relief", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisAfter other recent electoral setbacks for far-right populists, and the far right\u2019s flagging momentum in Germany\u2019s election campaign, some even suggested that the French election could represent the high-water mark of the populist surge that has voted Britain out of the European Union and Donald J. Trump into power in the United States.If this is a high-water mark, though, the water remains quite high.For the moment, the parties and personalities that have energized far-right populism have not fully crystallized electorally. But the issues that have animated the movements \u2014 slow economies, a lack of jobs, immigration \u2014 are not going anywhere, and the far right has already moved the political terrain in its direction.\u201cThere is a sigh of relief,\u201d said Jan Techau, the director of the Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin. \u201cIt\u2019s good that in addition to all the other issues on the agenda, we don\u2019t also have an extremist French problem.\u201dAfter a year of unpredictable elections in Europe and the United States, it would be unwise to discount Ms. Le Pen entirely, even if her odds are long. Still, the French result was particularly welcomed by Brussels and Berlin, which have been praying for a French partner willing to challenge both the statist structure of France and the complacency of the European Union. And after weeks of market jitters, investors on Monday cheered the results, with global stocks surging and the euro reaching fresh highs.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, broke protocol to congratulate Mr. Macron and wish him continued success, as did the German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, who said, \u201cHe will be a great president.\u201dBy winning more votes than Ms. Le Pen, Mr. Macron, who at 39 is on course to be France\u2019s youngest head of state since Napoleon, seemed to many to be a new generation\u2019s centrist answer to sclerotic and corrupt establishment politics and the challenge of populism and the far right.Even so, candidates of the far right and far left did very well in the voting, reflecting strong and skeptical views among the French public.\u201cOf course many people in Brussels and so on are relieved that we don\u2019t have two extremists in the last round, but only one,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, a German who directs Bruegel, a Brussels-based research organization.\u201cBut the fact of the matter is that we still have a little bit more than 40 percent of the electorate having voted for an extremist,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cSo that shows that a large part of the French population doesn\u2019t seem to be very happy with his or her own position and pretty dissatisfied with the political system.\u201dThe question for many is whether a centrist reformer like Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, is prepared to seriously take on board the dissatisfaction of ordinary working people.\u201cBut the threat from the far right is not over,\u201d they were quick to add. \u201cIf Macron is to take it on and defeat it, he needs to get real on social justice and do more for those who feel marginalized.\u201dStill, for a majority in Europe, the far right has not provided answers either, as it has fallen short of predicted triumphs.Yet on traditional measures, Ms. Le Pen did very well in the first-round vote on Sunday. She received nearly 7.7 million votes, compared with her 6.4 million in the first round in 2012 and the 4.8 million that her father, Jean-Marie, received when he advanced to the second round in 2002.While Ms. Le Pen is expected to lose in the runoff, Mr. Macron \u2014 as a youthful banker with an elite education \u2014 is an easy target for her. French unhappiness with establishment parties is sure to be reflected in the June votes for the French legislature, in which Mr. Macron and his year-old movement, En Marche!, will have to work hard to cobble together a working majority.Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, a research institute in London, cautioned that populist views have been growing for many years, not just in southern Europe but in \u201cmore settled northern Europe,\u201d like Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands.\u201cIn a time of economic turbulence, there\u2019s been a search for national identity and individual identity, a feeling that national identities are being stripped away at a pace people can\u2019t control,\u201d he said. \u201cThe E.U. is seen as an expression of that loss, and even a vehicle for it.\u201dAs important, the far right\u2019s nationalism and opposition to multilateralism have split mainstream parties and pushed the national conversation to the right.\u201cAt the moment, conservatives are doing a better job at coalescing support and co-opting aspects of the populist message,\u201d Mr. Niblett said. Each country has its own specific political context, he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see the validity of the populist message declining.\u201dGermany especially is looking forward to a more like-minded French partner, as together they make up about 47 percent of the eurozone\u2019s gross domestic product, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.\u201cMacron understands Europe and the need to change things, and that means changing France, too,\u201d she said, noting a speech by Mr. Macron in Berlin that directly linked \u201creform and modernization in France with reform in the E.U.\u201dThat is the perfect line for Germany, she said, \u201cwhich fears pressure for more burden-sharing with countries who haven\u2019t done their economic homework.\u201dMr. Macron has said he wants a common eurozone budget under a eurozone \u201cfinance minister\u201d and has proposed \u201cdemocratic conventions\u201d to identify reform priorities for the European Union.The Germans fear that if the eurozone integrates further with a budget and banking union, but without prior economic changes from its members, Germany will end up bailing out everyone else forever. So Mr. Macron, vowing economic reform in France, is singing a song much more attuned to German ears.But Mr. Macron, if elected, is also expected to push a harder negotiating line with Britain over its exit from the European Union \u2014 especially on the issue of financial services, about which he knows a great deal.\u201cWith his background, we assume Macron sees much more clearly where the actual issues lie and will work to prevent Europe from facing a competitive disadvantage,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said.But there is much to play for, not just in Britain\u2019s election in June but especially in Germany\u2019s in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a strong challenge from the center-left Social Democrats, and the far-right Alternative for Germany is likely to win seats in the federal Parliament for the first time.At the far right\u2019s party conference this past weekend in Cologne, there were strong themes of nationalism and distaste for immigration despite the party\u2019s internal disputes, in which Frauke Petry, one of its leaders, lost her effort to pull the party away from the hard right.Her rivals brought delegates to their feet with speeches that pandered to identity loss. Whether or not the party succeeds, the issue seems likely to continue to resonate broadly.J\u00f6rg Meuthen, a professor who leads the party with Ms. Petry, said that few Germans could be seen as one walked around a typical German town.\u201cThis is our country,\u201d he told cheering delegates. \u201cThe country of our grandparents and parents. We must take it back.\u201dSteven Erlanger reported from London, and Alison Smale from Cologne and Berlin. James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Plans Have Deal Makers Dreaming Big ($100-Billion-Cash-Takeover Big)", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "Supported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 It wasn\u2019t just cocktails on Bourbon Street or lucky breaks at the blackjack tables that contributed to the buoyant mood of the deal makers who gathered here last week. President Trump \u2014 and his support for lower taxes and lighter regulations \u2014 also had something to do with it.At a gathering of the nation\u2019s top mergers and acquisitions lawyers and bankers, the consensus was that under the Trump presidency, deal making should boom.Lower taxes and less regulation, the thinking goes, should contribute to strong stock prices. And when the markets are up, companies are more likely to strike big deals. Finally, the pro-business Trump administration, most deal makers believe, is likely to take a forgiving view when it comes to antitrust matters.Taken together, it was enough to lift the spirits of the lawyers, bankers and other advisers who attended Tulane University\u2019s mergers conference last week.Lawyers who attend earn legal credits (several lawyers said they eagerly awaited a panel discussion on the arcane matter known as shareholder appraisal rights, a topic that makes nonlawyers\u2019 eyes roll). But the real purpose of the event is to network, whether over butter-laden gulf fish at Galatoire\u2019s or sherried turtle soup at Commander\u2019s Palace or at the high-roller poker tables at Harrah\u2019s.Mergers data for the first three months of the year appeared to at least partly support that. Some 10,229 transactions, worth $771.3 billion, were announced in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. The dollar value was up 11 percent from the same time a year ago, although the number of deals was down about 11 percent.Yet doubts were already emerging about whether Mr. Trump will really usher in a boom time for mergers, with the failure of the Republican health care overhaul and the president\u2019s unpredictability threatening to dampen spirits.The tone for much of the conference was set as Kurt Simon, global chairman for mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan, made his bold prediction that an enterprising corporate giant today could assemble an all-cash takeover bid of $100 billion.\u201cThe U.S. economy is in really good shape,\u201d Mr. Simon said.For years, many of the panelists at Tulane argued vigorously that activist hedge funds trying to shake up companies were short-term investors and did not have the best interests of other shareholders at heart.Now, even the staunchest critics of these activist shareholders concede that the practice is here to stay.This conference was perhaps the first one in which an activist sat on stage with the chief executive of a company his firm had targeted. And each man sang the other\u2019s praises.\u201cI just want great outcomes,\u201d Mr. Hassell said when asked who deserved praise for the bank\u2019s turnaround. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue of who gets credit.\u201dAnd during another panel on activism, the entire group \u2014 advisers both to activists and to the companies those investors target \u2014 treated the practice as a permanent fixture on the corporate landscape.\u201cThe biggest change I\u2019ve seen in my practice is there is positive dialogue between the activist and the company for a settlement,\u201d she told the group.For lawyers in particular, one major draw of the conference is the chance to mingle with judges from Delaware, the corporate home for the vast majority of American companies.And in particular, that means hearing from the most quotable of them all: Leo E. Strine Jr., the chief justice of Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court.Mr. Strine is widely regarded as one of the sharpest minds on the Delaware bench, and almost certainly its sharpest wit.At the Roosevelt, he displayed the offbeat humor that laces his judicial opinions. He described one legally dubious situation as having a smell that was \u201cnot Bourbon Street when you\u2019re having fun, but Bourbon Street the next morning.\u201dNot all was sunshine at the Tulane conference, whether with the mercurial New Orleans weather or with the outlook on transactions.Panelists pointed to the rise of economic nationalism as a potential dampener on mergers. Both the Brunswick survey and Mr. Simon, of JPMorgan, cited a likely drop in offers for American companies by Chinese and Russian bidders.Then there was the prospect that the Republicans\u2019 failure to pass a replacement for Obama-era health care regulations made a sweeping tax law overhaul less likely. Some deal makers feared that the issues on which they most want to see reform \u2014 corporate tax rates and the taxation of sales made abroad and then brought back to the United States \u2014 could end up felled by political gridlock.\u201cPost-heath care, we have to consider a number of scenarios, one of which is that nothing happens,\u201d said Eileen T. Nugent of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.And finally, there is Mr. Trump himself, and his brand of economic populism.Merger proposals that would lead to big job cuts would be unlikely to go anywhere, George R. Bason Jr. of the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell said, calling such layoffs \u201ca tragedy for a lot of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Takes a Back Seat to Tesla as America\u2019s Most Valued Carmaker", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 By almost every measure, General Motors has been on a roll.Its bellwether pickups and sport utility vehicles have hit the sweet spot in a record-setting American market for two years. The company is steadily increasing profits and revenue. And President Trump has vowed to ease regulations and put cars at the forefront of his crusade to add manufacturing jobs.In short, G.M. has come a long way from a near-death experience eight years ago, when it filed for bankruptcy and needed a $49 billion government bailout. But apparently investors have yet to be convinced that G.M., the nation\u2019s largest automaker, has put its troubled past behind it.In a sign of how the industry\u2019s future is being reimagined, the electric-car maker Tesla passed G.M. on Monday as America\u2019s most valuable auto company.With its stock gaining more than 3 percent for the day to $312.39, Tesla has a market capitalization of $50.9 billion, just a hair ahead of G.M.\u2019s.G.M. is working hard to establish its own bona fides in automotive innovation, developing home-grown technology, acquiring or investing in Silicon Valley companies with promising approaches to self-driving or ride-hailing systems, and bringing a new electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt, to market.\u201cWe are spending money on the future, whether it is in mobility, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence or electrification,\u201d said Mark L.

And now an activist shareholder, the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, is pushing for a financial restructuring to unlock more of the company\u2019s value.But G.M. epitomizes both the frustration attached to the old American auto industry, and the determination to prove the skeptics wrong over the long term.A G.M. spokesman played down the company\u2019s loss of its title as the most valuable American automaker. \u201cWe have a track record of strong financial performance, with a great outlook for 2017,\u201d the spokesman, Tom Henderson, said on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay focused on delivering outstanding results, generating strong cash flows and investing capital where it will drive the highest returns.\u201dStill, G.M. executives know that investors worry whether the company owes its recent success mostly to a strong domestic market, buoyed by low oil prices that have indulged car buyers\u2019 tastes for big, profitable sport utility vehicles \u2014 conditions that could be at risk if the economy falters.\u201cNo one is going to believe we are for real until we successfully go through a downturn, and go through it well,\u201d Mr. Reuss said at a company event last week. \u201cWe have to prove it.\u201dThe company has taken some drastic steps recently to shed the baggage of past decades, when its desire to be the world\u2019s biggest automaker seemed to be its driving ambition.Moreover, the company has pared back incentives it once relied on to reduce bloated inventories, and eliminated factory shifts to better align production with demand.The newfound discipline, along with a consistent flow of new models, has helped G.M. outperform the United States market so far this year. Through March, its sales are up slightly less than 1 percent, while the industry over all is down 1.5 percent.The company is also aggressively updating older models and adding new ones. Its Buick division, for example, will take the wraps off new versions of its midsize Regal sedan and Enclave S.U.V. at media previews this week for the New York Auto Show. And the battery-powered Bolt has been on sale for months, while Tesla is still gearing up to produce its first mass-market electric car, the Model 3.Yet despite the expectations that G.M. will increase earnings and sales this year, the company suffers by comparison with Tesla, which has rarely made a profit but has huge potential to grow.Industry analysts see the race for stock market value as a competition tilted in favor of the little electric automaker that produces a fraction of the vehicles made by the big Detroit manufacturer.\u201cTesla is viewed as a high-tech start-up driven by lots of stock speculation, while G.M. is an old-line industrial business with lots of institutional investors,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the firm Autotrader.The frustration with G.M.\u2019s share price led Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund overseen by the billionaire investor David M. Einhorn, to propose creating two classes of stock \u2014 one that pays a dividend on the company\u2019s core business, and a second that tracks its growth in ventures such as autonomous vehicles and ride-hailing services.G.M.\u2019s board rejected the proposal, but the hedge fund \u2014 which owns about 3 percent of the company\u2019s stock, according to the automaker \u2014 has promised to take the fight to the annual meeting, likely to be held in June.The meeting could become a forum for Ms. Barra to defend the company\u2019s step-by-step strategy to innovate, while it continues to refine its older, core operations.Mr. Reuss, who has worked for G.M. for more than 30 years, said the company was taking a long view of its destiny, while at the same time defending its market share in North America and China.\u201cYears ago, G.M. was fixated on the next quarter or the next year \u2014 and not the next 10 years,\u201d he said.For now, the company can ill afford to allow a stagnant American market, or its costly restructuring efforts overseas, to crimp its momentum. Even the smallest setback could depress its market value \u2014 and allow Tesla to pull further ahead.\u201cThey have no choice but to keep focusing on what makes money, and that\u2019s selling pickup trucks and S.U.V.s,\u201d Ms. Krebs said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trudeau Unveils Bill Legalizing Recreational Marijuana in Canada", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 Fulfilling a campaign pledge, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced legislation on Thursday to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Canada.Many nations have either decriminalized marijuana, allowed it to be prescribed medically or effectively stopped enforcing laws against it. But when Mr. Trudeau\u2019s bill passes as expected, Canada will become only the second nation, after Uruguay, to completely legalize marijuana as a consumer product.\u201cCriminal prohibition has failed to protect our kids and our communities,\u201d said Bill Blair, a lawmaker and former Toronto police chief whom Mr. Trudeau appointed to manage the legislation.Mr. Blair said at a news conference that the government hoped to begin allowing legal sales by the middle of 2018. While the government\u2019s plan has been broadly shaped by a panel of experts, many issues still need to be ironed out.\u201cWe do accept that important work remains to be done,\u201d he said.While the federal government will license and regulate growers, each of Canada\u2019s provinces will need to decide exactly how the drug will be distributed and sold within its boundaries. The government will have to develop the marijuana equivalents of breathalyzers so that drivers can be checked for impairment at the roadside and workers can be tested for safety on the job. Diplomats will have to address conflicts with international drug treaties. And many in the medical field are concerned about the long-term health effects of increased use of marijuana by Canadians under the age of 25.Though eight American states have legalized marijuana to various extents, the drug remains illegal under federal law. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s move eliminates any such ambiguity in Canada. It follows a court-mandated legalization of marijuana for medical purposes, which was introduced with tight controls in 1999 and later broadened by further court orders.While the new legislation will take Canada beyond its medical marijuana system, it stops far short of creating an open market. The law will require purchasers to be at least 18 years old \u2014 though provinces can set a higher minimum \u2014 and it will limit the amount they can carry at any one time to 30 grams, about an ounce.Households will be allowed to grow up to four marijuana plants. But the legislation seems built on the assumption that most users will be supplied by commercial growers, who will be licensed and closely supervised by the federal government.Growing, importing, exporting or selling marijuana outside licensed channels will remain serious crimes, according to Mr. Blair and Ralph Goodale, the public safety minister.Each province will decide where and how marijuana may be sold, and will set prices in conjunction with the federal government.How much marijuana will cost and how heavily it will be taxed will be influenced by Canada\u2019s experience with tobacco, which is also tightly regulated.When the country tried to discourage smoking by sharply increasing cigarette taxes, it inadvertently created a growing black market for cigarettes smuggled from the United States and elsewhere.Since one of the government\u2019s main aims with the new law is to wipe out \u2014 or at least reduce \u2014 illicit marijuana dealing, it will want to avoid measures that spur its growth.Figuring out how to measure impairment is a priority on the government\u2019s list of things it must do before the legal market is expanded.Several police forces, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, are testing two types of screening devices that can detect drugs \u2014 including THC, the main psychoactive substance in marijuana \u2014 in saliva.Proposed amendments to criminal laws would require motorists to give the police saliva samples on request and allow officers to demand a breath test for alcohol when stopping drivers for any reason.The issue goes beyond motorists. Gilbert Brulotte, the former chairman of the Canadian Construction Association, said the law may lead to increased accident rates on job sites.Mr. Brulotte acknowledged that marijuana use by construction workers has been a safety problem for a long time. But until now, he said, any evidence of marijuana use was grounds to fire someone. After legalization, employers will need to show that the worker was impaired on the job.\u201cWe are not against legalization; we\u2019re just interested in making sure that thresholds and proper technologies are in place,\u201d Mr. Brulotte said, adding that the industry also wanted the right to perform random drug tests in the workplace.The promise of the new law has prompted investors to bid up the stocks of 11 licensed medical marijuana growers. Several have tripled or quadrupled in price over the past year.Mr. Blair said the Canadian system would place public health policy above commercial interests. \u201cIt is not our intent to promote the use of this drug,\u201d he said.Under the new law, marijuana will be marketed more like cigarettes than like liquor. Marketing will be limited largely to providing factual information about the product, like its name, its ingredients and the strain of marijuana used.The government is considering regulations that would allow only plain packaging to be used, as a bill now in Canada\u2019s Senate will require for cigarettes.Even so, Brendan Kennedy, the president of Tilray, a medical marijuana producer in Nanaimo, British Columbia, said his company would ask that producers be allowed to develop brands through distinctive packaging. \u201cOtherwise it will be a race to the bottom, as companies will compete only based on potency and price,\u201d he said.Though many licensed growers appeared to get into the medical marijuana business with an eye toward the eventual opening of the much larger recreational market, Canada\u2019s first legal grower said on Wednesday that the government\u2019s action was premature.Mr. Zettl, whose company had the medical marijuana market to itself for several years, said he owed it to his investors to get into recreational marijuana, but he was not certain that it would be very profitable.And he said he agreed with doctors and police officials who want higher minimum ages to buy the drug: 25 for high-potency products and 21 for reduced potency.The bill includes stiff new criminal penalties for people who sell or give marijuana to minors, or who create cannabis products that appeal to children or adolescents.Widespread use of more potent recreational marijuana, Mr. Zettl added, may also undermine efforts to understand the drug\u2019s medicinal effects, particularly for users looking for relief, not a high.\u201cIt\u2019s good from an industry perspective,\u201d Mr. Zettl said of the new law. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for society.\u201dAt the news conference, Mr. Goodale warned that Canada\u2019s new law would apply only in Canada, and cautioned citizens not to take their marijuana out of the country.John F. Kelly, the United States secretary of homeland security, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Ottawa last month that he saw no need for new border measures once the law took effect. But he did have a tip: \u201cI would just highly recommend to Canadians to check those pockets one more time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elliott\u2019s Plans to Squeeze Value From BHP Has Some Merit", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsElliott Management\u2019s plan to unlock more value from BHP Billiton has some merit.Tidying up, then breaking up could make shareholders in BHP Billiton, a British-Australian mining company, about 50 percent better off, the activist investor said. Elliott is not saying anything BHP has not already considered, and a full split looks a stretch, but it may prompt a helpful spring cleaning.There are three parts to Elliott\u2019s agenda. The hedge fund, which owns 4.1 percent of BHP, would like to see separate London and Australian corporate entities crunched into one business with headquarters in Melbourne, but with a primary listing in London. It wants to spin off BHP\u2019s petroleum business in the United States, which it values at $22 billion, and list it in New York. Finally, Elliott wants BHP to make use of stored tax credits and buy back shares more cheaply, for at least $6 billion.The first two parts are the most compelling. BHP\u2019s two-headed structure is a historical accident born out of the merger of BHP and Billiton in 2001, not a strategic move. Collapse them into one, and BHP could hand out some of the $9.7 billion of tax vouchers known as franking credits that currently are available only to Australian investors in the Sydney-listed shares.Because the Sydney shares trade at a premium to their London counterparts, merging them would also give a new, lower price from which the discount in a tender-offer buyback \u2014 effectively capped at 14 percent in Australia \u2014 can be calculated. It is tinkering, but it is worth a try.A breakup is trickier. True, splitting off BHP\u2019s petroleum business could have some benefits. Similar oil competitors like EOG Resources and Apache trade on multiples of nine to 11 times forward earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. BHP trades at about seven times, along with its pure-play mining rival Rio Tinto, suggesting that the benefits of owning a big oil business are not fully grasped by shareholders. But there is no sign the company is run any the worse for being diversified. Splitting would also amount to an embarrassing reversal of corporate strategy for management.Elliott reckons just the tidying-up and franking credit alone could add around 10 percent to BHP\u2019s value. BHP says the costs outweigh the benefits. The shares rose nearly 5 percent on Monday, suggesting the pressure for a breakup is weak. Still, two out of three is not bad, and the onus is now on BHP to explain why it works better together.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Dubious Key Witness Didn\u2019t Sink This Insider Trading Case", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchThe prosecution of William T. Walters for insider trading had it all: outsize personalities from the worlds of sports and business, a defendant known for high-stakes betting with a history of brushes with the law, the prosecution nearly compromised by an F.B.I. agent leaking confidential information to the news media, and a seriously flawed cooperating witness who struggled to tell the truth, even on the witness stand.The key witness in the case was Thomas C. Davis, a former chairman of the board of Dean Foods who also worked as a consultant in an activist campaign involving Darden Restaurants. He admitted giving inside information about both companies to Mr. Walters, but this was far from a simple case of an insider making a mistake by tipping a friend.Mr. Walters helped arrange loans of nearly $1 million to Mr. Davis, who had financial problems and never repaid the full amount he owed. Mr. Davis said that he innocently gave Mr. Walters information at first, but over time became a \u201cvirtual conduit\u201d about corporate developments.Their relationship developed to the point, Mr. Davis testified, that Mr. Walters gave him a prepaid cellphone that was nicknamed the \u201cBat Phone\u201d over which they communicated in code about companies, such as referring to Dean Foods as the Dallas Cowboys.During his closing statement, Dan Goldman, one of the prosecutors, said: \u201cTom Davis is morally corrupt. He\u2019s a womanizer, a bad husband, and he stole money from a charity he ran.\u201d Not exactly a ringing endorsement for the only witness who could link the inside information to Mr. Walters.Mr. Walters\u2019s lawyers argued that he was a great bettor who applied those skills to the markets, getting a \u201cread\u201d on a stock much as he could on an opponent across the green felt of a poker table. Mr. Berke said that an appeal of the convictions was planned.The structure of insider trading cases makes it easy to find a violation because they involve transactions that are often so well timed and lucrative that there is a visceral appeal to jurors asked to decide whether it was just investing acumen or something more nefarious. Mr. Davis carried some heavy baggage, so prosecutors built their case on the circumstantial evidence. They showed a pattern of interactions between the two men and let the jury infer that it must have been something more than gut instinct that led Mr. Walters to place the large wagers on the stocks that he did.The government also called Mr. Davis\u2019s estranged wife to testify about his pattern of calls with Mr. Walters in an effort to bolster his testimony about their interactions. Given his profligate lifestyle, calling a soon-to-be former spouse can actually help his credibility, because if she is willing to support his version of events, then it is more likely to be true.That is a sure sign that, even if they found Mr. Davis a person of questionable character, there was enough evidence to support his version of the events. Sometimes in a credibility battle it is not so much who the jury believes as whether there is enough so that the witness is not completely disbelieved.Winning a case with a cooperator as open to attack as Mr. Davis shows that the key evidence is often the combination of exceptional timing and some contact between the insider and the trader \u2014 at least when there are no recordings of information being passed. Unlike witnesses who use escort services, telephone records and highly profitable trading can be enough to build a case because they are objective.Judges are not required to follow the guidelines, and many have shown a proclivity to impose a sentence below the recommendation for insider trading, although that does not mean Mr. Walters will avoid having to spend at least some time in prison. He is 70 years old and has no prior convictions, so a prison term closer to five years is more likely.Advertisement"}

It is a very nice salad, a model of good behavior. It does not bring to mind images of mob violence. This is Union Square Cafe, though, a place that from the beginning has inspired attachments of a peculiar intensity.Other restaurants have customers; Union Square Cafe has fans, and knows it. Almost everything about the new place caters to their memories of the original, fetishizing the restaurant\u2019s own idiosyncrasies to an amazing degree. It\u2019s almost a museum to itself. If you\u2019re not part of the fan base, you might feel a bit like somebody who goes to see \u201cRogue One\u201d without ever having seen \u201cStar Wars.\u201dThe upstairs bar top where my cocktail rested was precisely the size of the old upstairs bar top because it was, in fact, the same piece of wood with a fresh coat of varnish. The art collection has come along for the ride, too, and one of the pleasures of the Rockwell layout is the way you seem to bump into a Frank Stella or a Claes Oldenburg or a Judy Rifka every time you turn around.The cellar stocks wines from Italy, France and the United States, and nowhere else. As Jason Wagner, the wine director, explained one night, those are the countries that were on the list when Union Square Cafe opened in 1985.The menu does not go so far as to point out all the old showstoppers \u2014 some from Michael Romano\u2019s reign in the kitchen and others from that of the current chef, Carmen Quagliata \u2014 but the servers are happy to help. Do I even need to say this? It\u2019s the most famous thing about Union Square Cafe: The servers are always happy to help.I hadn\u2019t realized the salad was a cult object, but I did know about the gnocchi. In this case, I stand with the cult. They are not so much gnocchi as little cushions of ricotta that have been tricked into holding their cylindrical shape only for as long as it takes to move them from the plate to the mouth.Consider me a fanboy when it comes to the ideally crunchy fritto misto, and the polenta, too, a $13 bowl of warm fluff that has absorbed its weight, and then some, in milk and creamy young cow\u2019s milk cheese. With maitake mushrooms and shiny green pesto, it\u2019s so filling and likable that you could make a meal of it and walk away more content than if you\u2019d had a 12-course tasting somewhere else.The risk in churning out old recipes like this is that the kitchen becomes bored, and the food boring. That\u2019s not happening at Union Square Cafe right now; the cooks seem to have dialed right in on the qualities that made these dishes favorites in the first place.Union Square Cafe has always been the offspring of a mixed marriage between a trattoria and a bistro, with an American bar and grill somewhere in the family tree. In the current phenotype, the trattoria genes are dominant.There is a wonderfully tender and gentle rabbit sugo, tossed with bands of pappardelle. Mr. Quagliata\u2019s pasta work can be just as satisfying when he carves out new traditions, tossing tubes of rigatoni with roasted carrots and sizzled scallions and chiles, then brightening the flavors with a spoonful of yogurt.A little less thrilling was a lasagna Bolognese that has been rotated off the menu for the time being; while the pasta sheets were as thin and light as any Italian could hope for, the flavors in the meat sauce weren\u2019t as developed as they might have been.Though I split that lasagna with somebody else so we could have traditional appetizer-primi-secondi meals, the mains are so imposing that a simple two-course plan is the wiser path. I was nearly done in by a braised lamb shank, although the bright salsa verde helped spur me along. Even the choices that sound lighter, like red snapper sandwiched between a thatch of shaved puntarelle and a bed of chickpea pur\u00e9e, or a flattened half-chicken, with cumin and dried chiles embedded in its surface and slabs of white sweet potato peeking out from below, are best tackled with an undented appetite.After all: There will be dessert, and it will not be a minor event, especially if somebody at your table has strong memories of the panna cotta (beautiful; the pastry chef, Daniel Alvarez, surrounds it with citrus segments and granola), or the pumpkin bread pudding (more bread than pudding when I last saw it), or the fantastic tart topped with a caramelized puff of banana so soft it seems to have blown apart.Sometimes Union Square Cafe\u2019s eagerness to please has something close to the opposite effect. When a server suggested with wide-eyed eagerness that I might like \u201ca very cold glass of milk\u201d with the espresso-chocolate cake, chills went down my spine, and not chills of anticipation. The last time I drank milk with a meal, I was wearing footed pajamas.Then I\u2019d remember how happy the service had made one of my guests, who had shown up before me, but still about 30 seconds too late to grab a seat at the downstairs bar. She spun around in agitation for a moment, but a manager spotted her and offered to call upstairs to see if there were any open bar stools there.The restaurant is far too nice to be polarizing, but it won\u2019t be everybody\u2019s cold glass of milk. Diners from the Instagram generation might want more crunch, more adventure or more spontaneity. I hope that as it settles into its new home, it gets a little less self-referential. But even now, it has a combination of energy and well-honed familiarity that\u2019s rare in Manhattan. It\u2019s rare anywhere, and it lifts this restaurant above fashion, to a plateau that it occupies all by itself.An earlier version of this article misstated the lowest star rating that Union Square Cafe has received from The New York Times.

The scale of that inflow becomes clear when it is compared with the rest of the mutual fund industry \u2014 more than 4,000 firms in total. All of them combined took in just a net $97 billion during that period, Morningstar data shows. Vanguard, in other words, scooped up about 8.5 times as much money as all of its competitors.\u201cFlows of this magnitude into one company are unprecedented,\u201d said Alina Lamy, an expert on fund flows at Morningstar. \u201cSince the crisis, investors have been saying, \u2018I may not be able to control the market, but I can control how much I pay in mutual fund expenses.\u2019 And when they look for quality funds with low fees, the first answer is Vanguard.\u201dThe triumph of index fund investing means Vanguard\u2019s traders funnel as much as $2 billion a day into stocks like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, as well as thousands of smaller companies that the firm\u2019s fleet of funds track. That is 20 times the amount that Vanguard was investing on a daily basis in 2009. It is manageable, in large part, because no stock-picking is involved: The money simply flows into index funds and E.T.F.s, and through February of this year, nine out of every 10 dollars invested in a United States mutual fund or E.T.F. was absorbed by Vanguard.By any measure, these are staggering figures. Vanguard\u2019s assets under management have skyrocketed to $4.2 trillion from $1 trillion seven years ago, according to the company. About $3 trillion of this is invested in passive index-based strategies, with the rest in funds that rely on an active approach to picking stocks and bonds.More broadly, this deluge of money abandoning higher-price actively managed funds for Vanguard\u2019s plain vanilla cut-rate vehicles has come as an existential shock to a mutual industry that has long been resistant to change.The effect within Vanguard has been no less profound. For decades, the firm has made the case that cheaper index funds will, over time, outperform more-expensive mutual funds that rely on brainy portfolio managers to pick stocks.Unlike its peers, Vanguard is owned by its funds \u2014 and ultimately its investors \u2014 so as money rushes in, expenses are persistently reduced, resulting in perpetual savings for the legions of Vanguard clients. They number well over 20 million and include New York Times employees: Vanguard runs the company\u2019s 401(k) retirement plans.The model has been a powerful one: Since 1976, fees on Vanguard funds have fallen to about 0.12 percent from about 0.70 percent. By comparison, Lipper calculates that the average fee for all mutual funds is currently 1 percent, although it has been coming down rapidly.\u201cMr. Bogle used to say, \u2018This is not our money,\u2019 and I agree,\u201d said F. William McNabb III, Vanguard\u2019s chief executive, referring to the extraordinary inflows. \u201cFor many years, there has been a real move to our way of investing. And it\u2019s more than active versus passive \u2014 it\u2019s high cost versus low cost.\u201dThis no-frills approach has come under some strain as cash flowing into Vanguard funds reaches new highs year after year, some people who follow Vanguard closely say. There have been reports of operational snarls, including website outages, longer-than-usual wait times on the phone and misdirected fund transfers.There is no doubt about Vanguard\u2019s commitment to pinching pennies. In touring the 287-acre campus of pathways, low-slung buildings and a commanding statue of Mr. Bogle, the sensibility is decidedly puritan.There are few flashy cars to be found in the parking lots. The walls are largely devoid of eye-catching art \u2014 with the exception of some musty paintings of the HMS Vanguard, a Napoleonic-era British warship that inspired the company\u2019s name.In sum, the look is slightly drab, certainly by Wall Street standards: rows of uniform cubicles, colorless carpets and an executive boardroom that seems more appropriate for a community college than one of the largest financial institutions in the land.Vanguard executives say they are disciplined in terms of plowing money back into people and technology, but not overly so. \u201cOur true investment spending has doubled in the past five years,\u201d Mr. McNabb said.This tension between breakneck growth and spending restraint is most acutely felt in the firm\u2019s retail division \u2014 or the front lines, as they are referred to here \u2014 where 6,000 customer service representatives attend to the wishes, demands and whims of the close to eight million clients who purchase their mutual funds directly from Vanguard. In 2015 and 2016, this division added 350,000 new accounts each year, numbers never before seen at the firm.\u201cThe spotlight is on us, given the growth, and there have been operational challenges,\u201d said Karin A. Risi, who oversees Vanguard\u2019s retail investor group and is in the midst of an aggressive hiring push. \u201cBut it is not fair to say we are not investing. Bringing in 2,000 crew on a base of 6,000 is not insignificant.\u201dAs with many executives at Vanguard, Ms. Risi gets a glint in her eye when she talks of the virtues of investing in low-cost index funds. Like the majority of her peers, she has spent the bulk of her career at the firm and, as a certified culture carrier, it is clear that she is taking the current growing pains to heart.\u201cMy parents were Vanguard investors, and I was investing in Vanguard funds in high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I feel the burden of this responsibility. We are serving a mission here.\u201dBeyond their devotion to indexing, Vanguard employees talk as if they are working on a frigate, a nod to the nautical images and themes embraced by Mr. Bogle at the company\u2019s founding.Employees are called crew, one eats at the galley (not the cafeteria) and works out in the \u201cship shape\u201d room, and new workers come onboard as opposed to being hired.\u201cYou absorb the culture and you join the cause,\u201d said Joseph Brennan, who, as head of global equity indexing, has had a front-row seat as the firm has expanded. His division embodies Vanguard\u2019s credo of do more with less: The 45 people he oversees globally look after $2 trillion in assets.\u201cOur assets per head are incredible,\u201d he said. At $44 billion per person, that certainly qualifies as an understatement.Already, six out of the 10 largest mutual funds by asset size belong to Vanguard, with the largest, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, now weighing in at $465 billion, according to Morningstar. Only two \u2014 American Funds\u2019 Growth Fund of America and its EuroPacific Growth Fund, both belonging to the Capital Group \u2014 are actively managed, promising higher returns for a steeper fee.An article in the Mutual Fund Quarterly last Sunday about the growth in inflows to the index fund giant Vanguard misspelled the given name of the executive who oversees its retail investor group. She is Karin A. Risi, not Karen. (The error was repeated in a picture caption.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Market Stocks Have Come Roaring Back. Can They Go Any Higher?", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byFundamentallyPropelled by a rebound in commodity prices, emerging market stocks have roared back over the last year. But if the sector is to continue to prosper, many fund managers say, it will need to be fueled by other factors.Weak commodity prices, which contributed to emerging market mutual and exchange-traded fund losses in 2013, 2014 and 2015, helped these funds post double-digit gains in the first quarter of this year. The funds are now up almost 17 percent in the 12 months through March.\u201cWhat has been driving emerging market returns in the last year was the recovery in commodity prices, which led to a number of commodity producers\u2019 doing well,\u201d said Arjun Divecha, head of the emerging markets equity team at the asset management firm GMO.This explains why funds focused on oil-dependent markets have risen more than emerging market equities as a whole: iShares MSCI Russia Capped E.T.F., for instance, is up more than 28 percent over the 12 months through March, while iShares MSCI Brazil Capped E.T.F. is up nearly 39 percent as oil prices have climbed 37 percent.But commodity bets are notoriously volatile and will take you only so far with emerging market stocks, several fund managers say. Several other strategies may make more sense for the longer term.For example, Michael Kass, manager of the Baron Emerging Markets Fund, favors what he calls EM 2.0 \u2014 companies led by \u201cvalue creators\u201d working in cutting-edge areas like software development, machine learning, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and other health sciences. \u201cThe biggest profits will be found in high-profit-margin companies trying to gain market share in all those areas,\u201d he said.One such company is China\u2019s Alibaba Group, which like Amazon.com is branching out beyond online retail into areas like cloud computing, machine learning and robotic delivery mechanisms like drones and driverless cars. Alibaba is the top holding in the Baron Emerging Markets Fund.An added benefit of owning these types of high-quality growth stocks, Mr. Kass said, is that they are likely to hold up better than their peers if emerging markets take another spill \u2014 one set off, perhaps, by rising interest rates in China and the United States.Innovation is not the only factor that may determine the success of investments in the developing world. \u201cOne focus now is on structural reform stories,\u201d said Ben Kirby, co-manager of the Thornburg Developing World Fund. He points out that many countries have been trying to restructure their economies for more sustainable growth.China has embarked on \u201csupply-side reforms\u201d to tackle overcapacity in several crucial industries, including steel and coal. \u201cThey\u2019re shutting down idle capacity and high-cost producers,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. In fact, he said, this may be one reason commodity prices have started to lift as Chinese supply is being restricted.India has also embarked on an economic reform effort. It just passed a national goods and services tax, which will replace and untangle a web of local- and state-levied fees. The hope is that the tax shift will promote business activity across the vast country\u2019s different regions, while raising tax revenues.What type of company would benefit from that? \u201cOne stock we\u2019ve added to lately is ICICI Bank,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. ICICI is not the most dominant bank in India \u2014 that would be the Mumbai-based HDFC Bank, he said, which is a leading provider of mortgage loans.\u201cThe problem is HDFC is expensive,\u201d he said, noting that the stock trades at more than four times the company\u2019s book value. In contrast, ICICI trades at a small fraction of that multiple, Mr. Kirby said, and the bank\u2019s focus on corporate loans means it could benefit from any economic improvements in India brought about by reform.Another approach to emerging market investing, and a classic one, still works well, said James Syme, senior fund manager with J O Hambro Capital Management. Investors can focus on exporters \u201cthat benefit from demand in the developed world,\u201d he said.These can be companies like Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor, which supply components to Western technology manufacturers. But they can also be exporters that cater to consumers in the developed world, like the Hyundai Motor Company.\u201cIf you get a world where the U.S. and eurozone do well and China slows slightly,\u201d Mr. Syme said, \u201cyou want to be cautious with commodities, selective in the emerging-market consumer space, and look at this third way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "William T. Walters, Famed Sports Bettor, Is Guilty in Insider Trading Case", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byFour times, the authorities went after the famed Las Vegas sports gambler William T. Walters, and four times the man known as Billy emerged victorious.But on Friday, Mr. Walters\u2019s luck turned, as a federal jury in Manhattan convicted him on fraud and conspiracy charges in one of the biggest insider trading trials in years.\u201cTo say that I was surprised would be the understatement of my life,\u201d Mr. Walters, who is 70, told reporters as he left the courtroom. \u201cIf I would have made a bet I would have lost. I just did lose the biggest bet of my life. Frankly I\u2019m in total shock.\u201dHis lawyer, Barry H. Berke, said he would appeal the verdict.Mr. Walters, one of the most successful professional sports gamblers in the country, was accused in the latest case against him of using nonpublic information from Thomas C. Davis, a board member of Dean Foods of Dallas, to make more than $40 million from 2008 to 2014 by realizing profits and avoiding losses.The investigation into Mr. Walters\u2019s activities and subsequent trial drew in prominent figures like Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire investor and unpaid adviser to President Trump, and Phil Mickelson, the champion professional golfer.The conviction of Mr. Walters lifted something of a cloud that had hung over the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan since December 2014, when a federal appeals court threw out the insider trading convictions of two hedge fund managers. That ruling led prosecutors to vacate the convictions and guilty pleas of several other people.The verdict against Mr. Walters was also a coda to a series of insider trading prosecutions led by Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan who was fired days before the trial began.The jurors in Mr. Walters\u2019s case reached their decision after deliberating for a little more than half a day, rendering a swift decision in a trial that lasted 14 days spread over four weeks.The quickness of the verdict vindicated of the government\u2019s trial strategy, including a decision to give a central role to Mr. Davis, an acknowledged embezzler and philanderer who had pleaded guilty to several offenses connected to the insider trading scheme.Mr. Davis, the government\u2019s main witness, had his credibility repeatedly called into question by lawyers for Mr. Walters. The defense team said Mr. Walters had been falsely implicated by Mr. Davis, who was desperate to escape punishment for his own misdeedsOne juror interviewed outside the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan where the trial was held said that he and the rest of the jury had not been swayed by that argument.\u201cWe looked at his credibility,\u201d the juror, Lonnie Drinks, said of Mr. Davis. \u201cEverything was factored.\u201dMr. Walters was convicted of 10 charges of securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy, the most serious of which carry a potential sentence of up to 20 years in prison.\u201cArmed with his illegal edge, Walters made huge, perfectly timed trades, at times accounting for over a third of the trading volume in Dean Foods stock,\u201d Joon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. \u201cIn engaging in his yearslong stock fraud scheme, Walters underestimated law enforcement\u2019s resolve to pursue and catch those who cheat the market.\u201dMr. Walters, who was once profiled by \u201c60 Minutes\u201d because of his betting prowess, was not the only big name to come up during his trial.Mr. Icahn emerged in testimony and court filings as having had frequent discussions with Mr. Walters. A broker for Mr. Walters testified on cross-examination that some of Mr. Walter\u2019s stock-trading ideas had come from Mr. Icahn, who was not charged with wrongdoing.During a hearing outside the presence of the jury, one of Mr. Walters\u2019s lawyers told the judge that Mr. Walters and Mr. Icahn were friends.The lawyer, Paul Schoeman, added: \u201cMr. Walters has a long history of investing in stocks that Mr. Icahn has publicly announced he\u2019s interested in.\u201dMr. Mickelson was also mentioned during the trial as someone who had traded in Dean Foods shares and once owed nearly $2 million in gambling debts to Mr. Walters.Mr. Mickelson made roughly $1 million trading Dean Foods shares; he agreed to forfeit those profits in a related civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Known as \u201cLefty\u201d for his left-handed stroke, Mr. Mickelson was not criminally charged. Though he was once seen as a potential witness at Mr. Walters\u2019s trial, he was never called to testify.Prosecutors said that Mr. Walters had tried to hide his actions by supplying Mr. Davis with a prepaid cellphone called the Bat Phone to use while conveying secret information and by sometimes speaking in code.During the trial, prosecutors displayed phone logs and trading records, and an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified that Mr. Walters sometimes made major trades within moments of speaking with Mr. Davis on the phone.For instance, the agent testified, Mr. Davis and Mr. Walters spoke on the phone for 10 minutes one day in 2008 beginning at 12:54 p.m. At 1:05 p.m., Mr. Walters bought 462,200 shares of Dean Foods stock for about $9.3 million.Mr. Davis provided Mr. Walters with secret Dean Food information about future earnings statements, the planned purchase of another company and a pending initial public offering, prosecutors said.At the same time, Mr. Walters arranged for loans of nearly $1 million to Mr. Davis, who had financial problems and repaid only a small portion of what he borrowed, prosecutors said.Defense lawyers offered a contrasting account. They said that Mr. Walters was a skilled and fearless trader, referred to by one of his brokers as \u201cthe Babe Ruth of Risk,\u201d who did not need inside information. Mr. Davis, Mr. Walters\u2019s lawyers said, was trying to save himself by maligning Mr. Walters.The competing narratives were on display throughout the trial. Mr. Davis testified that he had acted as a \u201cvirtual conduit\u201d of secrets and had supplied Mr. Walters with an \u201cenormous\u201d amount of information.At one point, Mr. Davis said, Mr. Walters provided him with the Bat Phone to use while communicating about Dean Foods, adding that later he had thrown it into a creek after federal agents visited his home.Mr. Davis also testified that Mr. Walters sometimes spoke in code, using \u201cDallas Cowboys\u201d to refer to Dean Foods and asking \u201cHow\u2019s the milkman doing?\u201d when inquiring about the company, then the country\u2019s largest dairy processor.Defense lawyers cross-examined Mr. Davis at length, eliciting acknowledgments that he had been squeezed for money, had taken $100,000 from a charity he ran, had mislabeled expenses on his taxes and had lied to many people, including investigators with the S.E.C.Mr. Walters\u2019s lawyers suggested that Mr. Davis had misled prosecutors about his sports gambling habits and his contact with prostitutes, at one point reading into the record phone numbers for escort services in Chicago, Denver, New York and San Francisco that Mr. Davis, who told prosecutors he had not hired prostitutes in recent years, had called in 2010, 2011 and 2014.Mr. Berke also questioned the existence of what he called the \u201cso-called Bat Phone,\u201d which was never recovered, pointing out that Mr. Davis had first told prosecutors that it was black before then testifying at trial that it was maroon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Crime and Different Punishments", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byLAST week, the State of Arkansas, which had executed exactly nobody since 2005, put to death Ledell Lee for the crime of murdering Debra Reese in 1993. Why now \u2014 11 years after the last execution, 24 years after the crime? Because the chemicals used for lethal injection were about to expire.The tendency in modern criminal justice has been to remove two specific elements from the state\u2019s justice: spectacle and pain. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, pillories and stocks and whipping posts became museum pieces, the hangman and the firing squad were supplanted by more technical methods, and punishment became something that happened elsewhere \u2014 in distant prisons and execution chambers, under professional supervision, far from the baying crowd.Few prisoners face execution, and anti-death penalty activists may yet reduce that number to zero. But botched injections are not the only ways in which we pile cruelties on the condemned. Our prison system, which officially only punishes by restraint, actually subjects millions of Americans to waves of informal physical abuse \u2014 mistreatment by guards, violence from inmates, the tortures of solitary confinement, the trauma of rape \u2014 on top of their formal yearslong sentences.It is not clear that this method of dealing with crime succeeds at avoiding cruel and unusual punishment so much as it avoids making anyone outside the prison system see it. Nor is it clear that a different system, with a sometimes more old-fashioned set of penalties, would necessarily be more inhumane.But not every violent offender is equally dangerous \u2014 a fact already reflected in sentencing, which releases many prisoners relatively swiftly. So there would be room to experiment with Salib\u2019s proposal, to offer some of the convicted the stocks followed by supervised labor, without leaping to the abolish-prison stage.I recognize (and Salib acknowledges) a strong historical reason not to conduct such an experiment: because of the memory of slavery, the role that public violence played in maintaining racial hierarchy, and the fear of resurrecting that violence in a country whose prison population is still disproportionately black.This argument is powerful, but I still wonder if it is not a little self-deceiving. I would rather face the firing squad than be strapped down and injected into eternity, and I would choose a strong dose of pain and shame over years under the thumb of guards and inmates and the state.We tell ourselves that we have prisoners\u2019 good in mind, and the higher standards of our civilization, because we do not offer them this choice. But those standards may be less about preventing ourselves from becoming like our sinful ancestors, and more about maintaining the illusion of clean hands \u2014 while harsh punishment is still imposed, but out of sight, on souls and bodies not our own.Ross Douthat\u2019s column of April 23 incorrectly described an aspect of the American prison population.

{"Headline": "Trump Rides a Market Wave, but Business Looks for Results", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byThe investor enthusiasm that began with President Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in November has burst out anew on Wall Street, even as Washington remains gridlocked and evidence of any real pickup in the economy is scarce.Stocks have surged 5 percent since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. And that is on top of the 6 percent rally that followed his win in November.The cause for bullishness on Tuesday was Mr. Trump\u2019s new call to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent \u2014 deficits, perhaps, be damned.\u201cC.E.O.s are pragmatists,\u201d said Bill George, a Harvard Business School professor who formerly ran Medtronic, the giant medical-device maker. \u201cIf you cut my taxes and ease up on regulations, then I will like you. The bigger question is, can he get anything done?\u201dThe market impact of the Trump presidency is based so far on prospects \u2014 with details and congressional dynamics left to be sorted out \u2014 rather than accomplishments.But plenty of other factors are providing a tailwind for traders, including unexpectedly strong earnings reports from blue-chip companies like Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s and the receding chances that French voters will turn their backs on Europe.Technology giants like Apple, Facebook and Amazon have shown robust growth, lifting the Nasdaq index past 6,000 for the first time on Tuesday, a 26 percent gain from a year ago.Blair Effron, a founder of Centerview Partners, a prominent independent investment bank on Wall Street, said he believed that beyond any immediate policy shift in Washington, investors had taken their cue from signs of healthier growth globally.\u201cEurope and emerging markets are doing better,\u201d Mr. Effron said, \u201cand there is an underpinning of global stability and growth that are having much more of an impact than people think.\u201dNot all the signals domestically are coming in strong, however. The government\u2019s initial report on the economy\u2019s first-quarter performance is due Friday, and it is expected to be weak.And even if Mr. Trump manages to get Congress to pass a tax overhaul, and corporate profits then boom, that will not necessarily translate into better overall economic performance, warned Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago.\u201cWe have to distinguish between pro-profit and pro-growth policies,\u201d she said. \u201cA pro-profit approach increases the share of the pie going to corporate earnings and shareholders. Pro-growth policies increase the size of the pie.\u201dSo far, Ms. Swonk said, the Trump administration seems to favor the former. And while Wall Street will always reward rising corporate profits with higher share prices in the short term, the country\u2019s long-term prospects will be undermined if that trend is not accompanied by policies that lead to faster economic growth.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to cut taxes, but reform is harder,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about closing loopholes than reducing rates because if you just go to 15 percent, you\u2019re going to leave a large hole in the federal budget.\u201dWhile the prospects for a tax overhaul are murky on Capitol Hill, especially in light of the failure of House Republicans in March to agree on a replacement for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, executives say they are encouraged by the business-friendly stance of the White House.Bruce Van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, said he was initially concerned by Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements on trade and immigration when he took office in January.\u201cI feel better because in the first 100 days, the president\u2019s tone on those issues has moderated,\u201d Mr. Van Saun said.At the same time, executive actions, like requiring government agencies to roll back two existing regulations for every new one, have also played well with business leaders, especially in the financial services industry.\u201cThat\u2019s caused some of the regulatory apparatus to pause and appreciate there is a new sheriff in town and the rules of the game are changing,\u201d said Mr. Van Saun, who took over at Citizens, a regional banking chain based in Rhode Island, after more than two decades on Wall Street.What is more, Mr. Van Saun added, \u201cthe commitment to the positive elements of the platform \u2014 lower taxes, less regulation and pro-energy policies \u2014 continues to be there.\u201dEnergy industry executives are hoping that Mr. Trump will deliver on his promises to reduce regulation in their sector and open up new areas for drilling and development.\u201cIf you watch what he does as opposed to the noise around him, so far so good,\u201d said Charif Souki, chairman of Houston-based Tellurian and a leading industry spokesman for increasing natural gas exports from the United States.Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major oil and gas independent, echoed Mr. Souki\u2019s cautiously optimistic assessment of President Trump.\u201cI think generally he\u2019s doing well,\u201d Mr. Sheffield said. \u201cI think the Republicans have to get together and get something done.\u201dTo be sure, Mr. Trump has spent more time listening to business leaders in the first few months of his presidency than actually delivering on what they want.\u201cIn the first 100 days of his presidency, Trump has given more attention to C.E.O.s than Obama did in eight years,\u201d said Mr. George, who is not a supporter of Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat he does is a whole different story. But they do feel like he\u2019s listening, and there\u2019s a lot of ego gratification in having the president listen to you.\u201dIf the president cannot deliver, or the economy fails to pick up speed, investors may be setting themselves up for a fall, warned Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank.A look at the business backgrounds of Trump administration appointees and advisers.\u201cExpectations for the future are wild,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cThere is quite a disconnect between what the data suggests and where the stock market is trading.\u201dStill, even if it looks frothy, the euphoria is not approaching tech-bubble levels circa 2000.\u201cIn 2000, the price-to-earnings ratio for Nasdaq was 170; today it is trading at 26 times,\u201d Charlie Bilello, the director of research at the investment advisory firm Pension Partners, said, referring to a common gauge for measuring stock valuations. \u201cThat is not cheap, but it\u2019s not crazy. We are definitely not at the level where the average guy quits his job to trade stocks.\u201dThat may be true, but there is no doubt that the explosion in the market value of these companies has taken many investment professionals by surprise, even if most investors agree that their corporate fundamentals are solid.With the rollback of the health care law put off and big infrastructure spending plans still up in the air, bulls and bears alike on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms will be focused on the prospects for a tax overhaul in the coming months.But within the business community itself, there are sharp differences between industries that stand to gain and those that stand to lose as the tax code is redrawn.A low overall corporate tax rate would be great but would not be worth giving up provisions like the mortgage interest deduction or homeowners\u2019 ability to write off state and local taxes, said William E. Brown, the president of the National Association of Realtors.At the same time, smaller manufacturers and others worry that they might still be subject to a nearly 40 percent rate even if larger corporations use their political clout to guarantee a hefty cut.Suku V. Radia, the chief executive of Bankers Trust, Iowa\u2019s largest independently owned bank, said he was eager to learn more details, like the impact of a major tax cut on the budget deficit.\u201cIt is obviously a significant drop from where we are currently, and I\u2019d like to at least be able to better understand what do we do to make up for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the loss of revenues going to be, and how are we trying to fill the gap?\u201dWhatever details come out of the White House, getting a tax bill passed will be anything but easy.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is such a thing as \u2018tax simplification,\u2019\u201d Mr. Radia said. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently complicated.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

One reason is that President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have departed the political scene, thereby depriving gun marketeers and the N.R.A. of the selling point that caused an eight-year binge of gun sales to buyers who feared tight new regulations.Americans concerned for public safety can only hope that the decline will continue as the nation\u2019s gun carnage seems likely to produce another year of 30,000-plus deaths. Mr. Trump himself has displayed no sense of responsibility to offer prescriptions for how that toll might be reduced through gun safety. Rather, in his appearance Friday, he stuck to the red-meat stuff expected at a convention where hundreds of companies displayed an astonishing 15 acres of guns and firearms paraphernalia for thousands of conventioneers.\u201cYou came through for me and I am going to come through for you,\u201d Mr. Trump declared, as gun owners cheered.

{"Headline": "Investing in Solar and Wind in a Coal and Oil Moment", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byAlternative energy investments like wind and solar power have not performed well in recent years. To make matters worse, the Trump administration has opted for a resurgence of coal and other carbon fuels, not an emphasis on alternative energy.Yet there is a reasonable argument that the outlook for investing in renewable energy may actually be quite good.Five states draw at least 20 percent of their electricity needs from wind. Kansas, for example, relied on wind for less than 1 percent of its electric power as recently as 2005. By 2016, wind produced 29.6 percent of its electric power, according to government figures.Intriguingly, all five of the most wind-dependent states \u2014 Kansas, Iowa, Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014 are traditional Republican strongholds. \u201cThe windiest places in the country are all red states,\u201d said Garvin Jabusch, a manager of the Shelton Green Alpha mutual fund.And the solar industry now employs over 260,000 workers nationwide, many of them in states that have leaned Republican. Texas, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina are among the largest solar employers.Ryan Issakainen, exchange-traded fund strategist and senior vice president at First Trust Bank, said that such sentiments could maintain policy support for solar and wind power. \u201cPolicies that favor coal over other sources would be sound in places like West Virginia,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re in the middle part of the country where you\u2019ve got more opportunity for wind power, you\u2019re not going to be supportive of pro-coal policies.\u201dBut for solar power, the fundamental economic outlook may conceivably be improving. \u201cThe reason solar stocks have done poorly is a big oversupply of panels, which drove down the price,\u201d said Richard Asplund, research director for the MAC Solar Index, the tracking index for the Guggenheim Solar fund. \u201cPricing looks better for this year and next.\u201dThe Guinness Atkinson fund, loaded with Chinese solar panel producers, has suffered large losses the last three years. But it was up nearly 5 percent in the first quarter.Mr. Guinness says that investors have been too gloomy. \u201cThe sentiment on the sector is terrible,\u201d he said. Negative sentiment has produced valuations \u201cas low as we\u2019ve seen\u201d by measures like price to book, Mr. Guinness said.Solar power will soon have to compete without government support, Mr. Guinness said, but he\u2019s untroubled by the switch. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the transition from a government market to a nonsubsidized market,\u201d he said.Such excitement may be difficult to sustain in the wake of recent Trump actions. On March 28, the president signed an executive order to initiate a rewrite of President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, an initiative designed to speed utility conversion from coal. Under that plan, renewable energy sources were projected to become more important than coal and second only to natural gas in electricity generation by 2030, said Chris Namovicz, lead renewable energy analyst at the U.S. Energy Information Administration. If the Clean Power Plan is really abandoned, he said, \u201cin 2040, renewables will still be third, behind both coal and natural gas.\u201dRolling back the plan entirely will be difficult, and Mr. Jabusch, who runs the Shelton Green Alpha fund, remains optimistic about the sector. His fund returned 8.51 percent in the 12 months through March 31. He estimates that 20 to 24 percent of his portfolio is typically invested in companies involved with renewable energy.Mr. Jabusch is particularly bullish on solar power. \u201cI think solar has been mispriced,\u201d he said. While falling prices have hurt panel producers, he said, price declines have expanded the market, and low valuations represent an enormous buying opportunity. \u201cThe solar companies could be 10-baggers over the next decade,\u201d investments that could increase tenfold, Mr. Jabusch said, borrowing a term from Peter Lynch, the Fidelity mutual fund manager.Mr. Jabusch said he favors companies like 8Point3 Energy Partners, which offers a yield of roughly 8 percent, and JA Solar Holdings Company, which derives most of its revenues from Europe and Asia and is, in his view, attractively priced.Mr. Asplund, the research director for the MAC Solar Index, argues that even if the Trump administration\u2019s energy policies pose a problem, solar power investments can still prosper. \u201cThe solar industry is a global industry,\u201d he said. \u201cU.S. installations are less than one-quarter of global.

{"Headline": "French Markets Surge as Euro Withstands Attack From the Right", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The euro has avoided another existential crisis that might have wreaked havoc on Europe and the global economy. That was the conclusion investors divined from the first round of voting in the French presidential election, prompting exuberant buying on markets around the world on Monday.Those in control of money looked beyond the fact that Marine Le Pen, a far-right candidate bearing intense hostility to the euro, claimed a spot in the second round of balloting on May 7. Instead, they focused on polls showing that she was likely to be defeated, and by a lopsided margin, at the hands of her sole remaining opponent \u2014 Emmanuel Macron, a pro-European figure trusted by business leaders.For markets anxious about the prospect of a Le Pen presidency, it was as if a fire-breathing dragon hovering over the kingdom had been slain.Stocks on French exchanges surged to a nine-year high as a wave of relief washed over the commercial realm. The value of the euro climbed nearly 2 percent against the dollar before yielding some of those gains. The gap between interest paid on French sovereign debt and rock-solid German government bonds narrowed, an indication that investors were seeing diminishing risks. The optimism spread to the United States, with American stocks up more than 1 percent and investors selling off safe havens like Treasury bonds.The manic swings of the markets \u2014 first spooked by the possibility of a Le Pen presidency, then ecstatic over the apparent unlikelihood of that possibility \u2014 attest to the gnawing fear that the euro could still succumb to whatever blow history delivers next. The euro confronts a chronic shortage of faith in its ability to persevere, along with a surplus of threats to its existence.In recent years, the euro has survived enough Greek tragedy to fill an Aeschylus trilogy and has had sufficient brushes with Italian banks for an opera. It has endured a global financial shock, years of regional economic stagnation and no end of cross-border political accusations.As Ms. Le Pen appeared to see her electoral fortunes expand in recent months, the markets construed yet another direct threat to the euro\u2019s sustainability.Ms. Le Pen, the leader of the National Front party, has long disdained the euro as a threat to prosperity. She has pledged to convert French debt into a new national currency, an undertaking that could begin the euro\u2019s downfall. And she has vowed to renegotiate France\u2019s relationship with the European Union, threatening to upend the project of European integration that has prevailed on the Continent as an antidote to the brutalities of World War II.Her strength in polls in recent weeks prompted investors to demand greater returns on French government debt, a sign that the odds of default \u2014 however minute \u2014 were multiplying. Investors had been aggressively purchasing options that offered protection against a precipitous plunge in the value of the euro.Few gave credence to the prospect that Ms. Le Pen could actually deliver on her radical promises. Even if she were to shock pollsters and win, her party would almost certainly fall well short of claiming a majority in the French Parliament after legislative elections in June. She would be relegated to figurehead status, with governing handled by a prime minister selected by the party in command.Still, concern in the markets underscored the fundamental defects that have long compromised the euro. It is a structurally flawed currency, one adopted by 19 nations \u2014 known collectively as the eurozone \u2014 that operate without a unified political organization.Many argue that the euro was doomed from inception. It was conceived more as an idealistic reach for European cooperation than as a reasoned plan to manage a currency. The assumption was that shared money would spur greater European political integration.Instead, the euro has devolved into a major source of political acrimony across the Continent.In countries with their own money, bad economic times typically prompt governments to spend more to generate jobs and spur growth. Their currencies fall in value, making their goods cheaper on world markets and aiding exports.But countries in the eurozone cannot fully avail themselves of those benefits. The currency comes with rules limiting the size of budget deficits. Faced with hard times, governments using the euro have been forced to intensify the hurt on ordinary people by cutting pensions and other public outlays.As Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have slid into debt crises in recent years, they have accused Germany of self-serving inflexibility in demanding strict adherence to debt limits while refusing to transfer wealth to those in trouble. Germany and other northern countries have accused their southern brethren of failing to carry out changes \u2014 like making it easier to fire workers \u2014 that would make them more competitive.The crises have time and again exposed the structural flaws of the eurozone, and its tendency to generate more recrimination than action.\u201cYou have a basic situation in the eurozone now where it\u2019s like a half-built house,\u201d said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cAs long as that persists, a large number of investors are going to have existential doubts about the euro.\u201dThe latest alarm was being set off by France, one of the euro\u2019s charter members, and a pillar of the European Union. This was playing out against a backdrop of destabilizing events that once seemed impossible \u2014 the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States and the vote in Britain to abandon the European Union, also known as Brexit.In the same interview, she confirmed her desire to yank France free of the euro.\u201cIf we don\u2019t all leave the euro behind, it will explode,\u201d she said.Ms. Le Pen has since muted talk of renouncing the euro in favor of adding a parallel currency, the franc. But the threatened act of redenominating French debt would almost certainly lead to a downgrade of France\u2019s credit rating, bringing severe market consequences, said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy based in London.Mr. Rahman traced a potentially calamitous string of events that could play out after a victory by Ms. Le Pen. Even before parliamentary elections, she could appoint a temporary government while serving notice that France intended to renegotiate the terms of its membership with the European Union.\u201cHer room for maneuver is greater than people believe,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cShe will have interpreted her election as a massive mandate. It flows from Brexit, it flows from Trump, and she\u2019ll try to get as much of her agenda done while she is unrestrained.\u201dEven if she is stymied by political backlash, she could cause a volatile reaction in financial markets. Around the globe, central banks, sovereign wealth funds and asset managers hold some 700 billion euros (about $760 billion) in French government debt. A Le Pen presidency could scare them into unloading some of it, increasing borrowing costs for the French government and the business world.French banks could see consumers pull euros out of their accounts to be saved elsewhere. If that became a bank run, the consequences could become global, given that France\u2019s four largest banks are deeply intertwined in the international financial system.Most analysts dismiss such talk as apocalyptic. The French Parliament and Constitution would severely constrain a President Le Pen. Investors would grasp that. Still, in the run-up to the first round, the costs of protecting assets against government default grew in Italy, as well as in France.The fear was that if Ms. Le Pen were to win the presidency, the risks would proliferate. That would increase the costs of borrowing for businesses and households in Italy, Spain and Portugal, impeding job creation and economic activity, while perhaps forcing governments to cut services.That could generate public anger, stoking the fires of populism as Italy goes to the polls early next year. Enhanced electoral prospects in Italy for the Five Star Movement, which favors scuttling the euro, could result.In short, a victory by Ms. Le Pen would add momentum to Europe\u2019s crisis of confidence. It would inject greater dysfunction into European institutions, rendering them even less capable of alleviating economic troubles. And more strife has in recent times has translated into more support for the populist movements seeking to dismantle those institutions.\u201cIt would be devastating for the eurozone and the E.U. if she won,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said. \u201cIt would certainly paralyze the eurozone in terms of almost anything for at least five years.\u201dBut on Monday, as stock markets exulted and the euro climbed, that possibility had seemingly been rendered hypothetical.The euro \u2014 perpetually afflicted by doubt \u2014 had dodged the latest immediate threat to its permanence.Advertisement"}

But now, on opposite sides of the globe, sun-creased fishermen lament as they reel in their nearly empty nets.\u201cYour net would be so full of fish, you could barely heave it onto the boat,\u201d said Mamadou So, 52, a fisherman in Senegal, gesturing to the meager assortment of tiny fish flapping in his wooden canoe.A world away in eastern China, Zhu Delong, 75, also shook his head as his net dredged up a disappointing array of pinkie-size shrimp and fledgling yellow croakers. \u201cWhen I was a kid, you could cast a line out your back door and hook huge yellow croakers,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the sea is empty.\u201dBut China, with its enormous population, growing wealth to buy seafood and the world\u2019s largest fleet of deep-sea fishing vessels, is having an outsize impact on the globe\u2019s oceans.\u201cChinese fleets are all over the world now, and without these subsidies, the industry just wouldn\u2019t be sustainable,\u201d said Li Shuo, a global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia. \u201cFor Senegal and other countries of West Africa, the impact has been devastating.\u201dThe sea\u2019s diminishing returns mean plummeting incomes for fishermen and higher food prices for Senegalese citizens, most of whom depend on fish as their primary source of protein.\u201cWe are facing an unprecedented crisis,\u201d said Alassane Samba, a former director of Senegal\u2019s oceanic research institute. \u201cIf things keep going the way they are, people will have to eat jellyfish to survive.\u201dThe nation\u2019s fishing industry employs more than 14 million people, up from five million in 1979, with 30 million others relying on fish for their livelihood.\u201cThe truth is, traditional fishing grounds in Chinese waters exist in name only,\u201d said Mr. Zhang of Nanyang University. \u201cFor China\u2019s leaders, ensuring a steady supply of aquatic products is not just about good economics but social stability and political legitimacy.\u201dBut as they press toward other countries, Chinese fishermen have become entangled in a growing number of maritime disputes.For Senegal, which stretches along the Atlantic for more than 300 miles, the ocean is the economic lifeblood and a part of the national identity. Seafood is the main export, and fishing-related industries employ nearly 20 percent of the work force, according to the World Bank.Ceebu jen, a hearty fish stew, is the national dish, and sawfish \u2014 once plentiful but now rare \u2014 grace bank notes. No Senegalese postcard is complete without an image of pirogues, the exuberantly painted boats fishermen use.\u201cForeigners complain about Africa migrants coming to their countries, but they have no problem coming to our waters and stealing all our fish,\u201d said Moustapha Balde, 22, whose teenage cousin drowned after his boat sank in the Mediterranean.\u201cWe always thought that sea life was boundless,\u201d he said while patrolling the coastline. Now, he added, \u201cwe are facing a catastrophe.\u201dMr. Sall became a local hero after he single-handedly detained the captains of two Chinese boats that were fishing illegally. These days, residents curse him under their breath because he has expanded his campaign against overfishing to include Senegalese boats that flout fishing rules designed to help stocks rebound.\u201cI understand why they hate me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are just trying to survive from day to day.\u201dStill, most of his ire is directed at the capacious foreign-owned trawlers. These days, more than 100 large boats work Senegalese waters, a mix of European, Asian and locally flagged vessels, according to government figures. That number doesn\u2019t include boats that fly Senegalese flags but are owned by Chinese companies.Also uncounted are the ships that fish illegally, often at night or on the fringes of Senegal\u2019s 200-mile-wide exclusive economic zone \u2014 well out of reach of the country\u2019s small navy.According to her estimates, Chinese boats steal 40,000 tons of fish a year from Senegalese waters, an amount worth roughly $28 million.The problem is magnified across West Africa. Some countries, like Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone, have just a handful of boats to police their national waters..In Senegal, recent legislation has drastically increased fines for illegal fishing to $1 million, and officials pointed to the two impounded foreign-owned boats in Dakar, the nation\u2019s capital, as proof that their efforts are bearing fruit.His agency cannot afford speedboats or satellite imagery; it could also use a functioning airplane. \u201cStill, we have more than many other countries, and we have to help them, too,\u201d he said.Most of the small pelagic fish that swim in Senegalese waters \u2014 and make up 85 percent of the nation\u2019s protein consumption \u2014 migrate in enormous schools between Morocco and Sierra Leone. Along the way, they are scooped up by hundreds of industrial trawlers, at least half of them Chinese-owned, experts say.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say no to China when they are building your roads,\u201d said Dr. Samba, the former head of Senegal\u2019s oceanic research institute.Then there is the lack of transparency that keeps national fishing agreements with China secret.Beijing has become sensitive to accusations that its huge fishing fleet is helping push fish stocks to the brink of collapse.\u201cThe era of fishing any way you want, wherever you want, has passed,\u201d Liu Xinzhong, deputy general director of the Bureau of Fisheries in Beijing, said. \u201cWe now need to fish by the rules.\u201dBut criticism of China\u2019s fishing practices, he added, is sometimes exaggerated, arguing that Chinese vessels traveling to Africa were simply responding to the demand for seafood from developed countries, which have been reducing their own fleets.\u201cPeople come to me and ask, \u2018If China doesn\u2019t fish, where would Americans get their fish to eat?\u2019\u201d he said.Here in Joal, the dwindling catches have prompted the closing of three of the town\u2019s ice factories, with the fourth barely holding on. On the town\u2019s main quay, where women wade into the surf to meet arriving pirogues, the competition for fish has become intense.\u201cWe used to have big grouper and tuna, but now we are fighting over a few sardinella,\u201d said one buyer, S\u00e9nte Camara, 68. On a good day, she makes $20; on a bad day, she loses money. \u201cThe future is dark,\u201d she said.To catch anything, fishermen have to venture out farther, putting their lives at risk if an engine stalls or a late summer storm barrels through. Sometimes the danger is a super trawler whose wake can easily swamp a pirogue.At Joal\u2019s vast outdoor smoking center, the lack of fish was apparent in the empty racks normally stacked with yellow-tailed sardinella and millet stalks smoldering below.Daba Mbaye, 49, one of the few people working, said the smokers could no longer compete with the fishmeal factories.\u201cThey leave us with nothing, and we are powerless to stop them,\u201d Ms. Mbaye said. \u201cNow we are forced to catch juvenile fish, which is like going into a house and killing all the children. If you do that, the family will eventually disappear.\u201dKiki Zhao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Has Reshaped the Presidency, and How It\u2019s Changed Him, Too", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byBut just as Mr. Trump has changed the presidency, advisers and analysts say it has also changed him. Still a mercurial and easily offended provocateur capable of head-spinning gyrations in policy and politics, Mr. Trump nonetheless at times has adapted his approach to both the job and the momentous challenges it entails.As Washington pauses to evaluate the opening phase of the Trump presidency, the one thing everyone seems to agree on is that, for better or worse, the capital has headed deep into uncharted territory. On almost every one of these first 100 days, Mr. Trump has done or said something that caused presidential historians and seasoned professionals inside the Beltway to use the phrase \u201cnever before.\u201dHe has assumed even more power for the presidency, expanding President Barack Obama\u2019s use of executive orders to offset the inability to pass major legislation and making it more independent of the Washington establishment. He has been more aggressive than any other president in using his authority to undo his predecessor\u2019s legacy, particularly on trade, business regulation and the environment. And he has dominated the national conversation perhaps more thoroughly than any president in a generation.At the same time, he has cast off conventions that constrained others in his office. He has retained his business interests, which he implicitly cultivates with regular visits to his properties. He has been both more and less transparent than other presidents, shielding his tax returns and White House visitor logs from public scrutiny while appearing to leave few thoughts unexpressed, no matter how incendiary or inaccurate. And he has turned the White House into a family-run enterprise featuring reality-show-style, \u201cwho will be thrown off the island?\u201d intrigue.In effect, she said, that compensates for a victory he secured in the Electoral College without winning the popular vote. \u201cThat gives him as much leverage as someone who won with landslide numbers \u2014 and the freedom to govern his way,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd his voters love him for it.\u201dWhere Washington veterans fret about deviations from past norms, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters see a president willing to shake things up. Where Washington cares about decorum and process, they want a president fighting for them against entrenched powers.All the more so for the first president in American history who had never spent a day in government or the military, and surrounded himself with top advisers who had not either. Although Mr. Trump assumed that his experience in business and entertainment would translate to the White House, he has found out otherwise.He badgered specific companies on Twitter about moving jobs overseas and called in the chief executive of Lockheed Martin to complain about the cost of the F-35 fighter jet, never mind that presidents typically do not involve themselves in the affairs of individual companies or directly negotiate federal contracts.Mr. Trump likewise has gleefully taken credit on days that stocks have risen and publicly commented on the strength of the dollar, which presidents generally do not do either, both because it might be viewed as unseemly interference in the markets and because it invites blame when they have a bad day.His boastfulness knows few bounds. \u201cI truly believe that the first 100 days of my administration has been just about the most successful in our country\u2019s history,\u201d he said in his weekly address on Friday.Another change to the presidency involves Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns \u2014 a practice of presidents for 40 years \u2014 and his continued ownership of a vast business empire that includes properties both overseas and blocks from the White House. \u201cHe has overstepped the ethics limits that have bound all other presidents for decades,\u201d said Norman L. Eisen, a chief White House ethics adviser under Mr. Obama.But if the presidency had grown somewhat stale under the old norms as its occupants increasingly stuck to carefully crafted talking points and avoided spontaneity, Mr. Trump has brought back a certain authenticity and willingness to engage. His frequent news conferences and interviews can be bracingly candid, uninhibited, even raw. He leaves little mystery about what is on his mind.\u201cThe 2016 election wasn\u2019t a delicate request to challenge existing traditions; it was a demand that our next president do things different,\u201d said Jason Miller, a top adviser to Mr. Trump during the campaign. \u201cAnd while the professional political class struggles to understand what has happened to their hold on power, supporters of President Trump \u2014 the forgotten men and women he referenced in his Inaugural Address \u2014 love the change they\u2019re seeing.\u201dEven if Mr. Trump adapts, though, the larger question is whether the institution will ever be the same. Future presidents may feel freer to make unfounded statements, withhold tax returns or keep private business interests without fear of political penalty. Taboos once broken no longer seem inviolable.Karl Rove, the senior adviser to the younger Mr. Bush, agreed. \u201cPresident Trump will make it difficult for future presidents to step back from the use of social media,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s very likely the next administration will be more restrained and less personal.\u201d The next president, he added, will probably deploy social media as a premeditated strategy. \u201cIt will be part of a plan, not a method of catharsis.\u201d\u201cMight the Trump presidency be viewed similarly someday?\u201d she asked. \u201cDifficult to see at the 100-day mark, but that is an artificial measurement, with so much of the presidency still to come.\u201dFollow Peter Baker at @peterbakernytAdvertisement"}

Bannon, the president\u2019s senior adviser, made as much as $2.3 million last year.\u25a0 Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council and the former No. 2 executive at Goldman Sachs, has assets valued at $252 million to $611 million.In addition to the many millions of dollars in cash and stock Mr. Cohn received from Goldman Sachs that made up the lion\u2019s share of his personal assets, he held a slew of positions in publicly traded stocks \u2014 many of which he has already said he plans to sell \u2014 and in various private entities. Those entities include a stake valued at more than $1 million in a consumer education and consulting business called Payoff, a position in a cosmetics retailer also valued at more than $1 million, investments in several self-storage concerns in Ohio valued at $100,000 or more each, and an investment in a venture capital fund run by Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley powerhouse, valued at $100,000 or more.\u2014 Kate KellyMr. Bannon may be one of the best known figures in the Trump White House, but as the Trump administration goes, he\u2019s probably not one of the wealthiest. But by the standards of many Americans, he appears to be doing quite well.Mr. Bannon\u2019s most valuable asset was Bannon Strategic Advisors Inc., a privately held consulting firm from which income from his other investments appeared to flow into. It was valued at $5 million to $25 million.He also listed the value of his Bannon Film Industries at $1 million to $5 million. His bank accounts were valued at as much as $2,250,000, while he listed rental real estate valued at as much as $10.5 million.Mr. Bannon served until last summer as vice president of Cambridge\u2019s board.\u2014 Eric Lipton, Steve Eder and Jonathan Weisman\u25a0 The president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law will remain the beneficiaries of a sprawling real estate and investment business still worth as much as $740 million, despite their new government responsibilities.\u25a0 Ms. Trump will maintain a stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers, is wealthy, but modestly so when compared with some of her superrich colleagues.\u2014 Ben ProtessJulia Hahn, until she went to work in the White House, was known as the 20-something reporter who filled Breitbart.com with conservative screeds. But she is also quite rich for her age.Her work as a journalist was also nothing to sneeze at. As a reporter, she made $117,217 last year at Breitbart. On top of that, she earned $74,082 from Laura Ingraham\u2019s radio show.\u2014 Jonathan WeismanAt his daily briefing on Friday, the White House press secretary Sean Spicer tried to put the best spin on the vast wealth that would be on display Friday night:I think one of the really interesting things that people are going to see today \u2014 and I think it\u2019s something that should be celebrated \u2014 is that the president has brought a lot of people into this administration, and this White House in particular, who have been very blessed and very successful by this country, and have given up a lot to come into government by setting aside a lot of assets. And I think it speaks volumes to the desire for a lot of these people to fulfill the president\u2019s vision and move the agenda forward that they are willing to list all of their assets, undergo this public scrutiny, but also set aside a lot.The White House disclosures fit an age-old pattern in Washington of dumping mountains of documents on Fridays, when normal people have left work and are beginning to enjoy their weekend. Not many are likely to be glued to their computers and television sets to track the wealth of White House officials.Here\u2019s the list of the disclosure forms we\u2019ve received so far:Reporting was contributed by Eric Lipton, Barry Meier, Rachael Abrams, Sarah Cohen, Jeremy Bowers, Andrew Lehren, Steve Eder, Jonathan Weisman, Lara Jakes and Ben Protess.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ice Roads Ease Isolation in Canada\u2019s North, but They\u2019re Melting Too Soon", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byON THE TLICHO WINTER ROAD, Northwest Territories \u2014 In Canada\u2019s northern latitudes, the frigid winter means freedom.That is when lakes and rivers freeze into pavements of marbled blue ice. For a few months, trucks can haul fuel or lumber or diamonds or a moose carcass to the region\u2019s remote communities and mines that are cut off by water and wilderness, reachable for most of the year only by barge or by air.But Canada\u2019s ice roads \u2014 more than 3,300 miles of them \u2014 have been freezing later and melting earlier, drastically reducing the precious window of time that isolated residents rely on to restock a year\u2019s worth of vital supplies, or to simply take a road trip.Even in the depths of winter, increasingly frequent storms and thawing have made the roads more dangerous and sometimes too weak to use safely, prompting the authorities to close them for days at a time.\u201cIt\u2019s taking longer for everything to freeze up, and the ice isn\u2019t as thick,\u201d said Wally Schumann, the minister of infrastructure for the Northwest Territories. \u201cIce roads are the lifeline of our communities, and now they\u2019re at risk.\u201dMr. Schumann said climate change was also to blame for the troubles with the ice roads, which are built anew each year by hardy crews using heavy-duty plows, radar and water sprays to add layers of smooth ice that can support even the weight of a tractor-trailer full of mining equipment.The roads are meant to last from January through April, but much of this year\u2019s network is already unusable. The Dettah Ice Road across Yellowknife Bay closed on April 7, about two weeks earlier than average.As the ice roads have become increasingly unreliable, pressure has grown for Canada to prepare for a future without them, by building all-season land roads \u2014 a time-consuming and expensive job, estimated at 600,000 Canadian dollars, or about $450,000 per mile, maintenance not included.\u201cA lot of people say we\u2019re out of time, we have to deal with this right now,\u201d Mr. Schumann said.For the people in the far north who wait anxiously each winter for the ice roads to reach their marooned communities, the crisis is becoming a matter of life and death.\u201cThese roads are the only way our people can survive,\u201d said Alvin Fiddler, grand chief of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents 49 indigenous communities in northern Ontario, including 32 that are isolated from Canada\u2019s highway network and electrical grid and depend on the winter road system to replenish stocks of fuel, food and building materials.Some of those communities nearly ran out of diesel fuel because an ice road opened several weeks late, Mr. Fiddler said. Each community needs about 264,000 gallons of fuel to keep the lights on all year, enough to fill 40 tanker trucks. Flying it in would cost an additional $520,000, a prohibitive amount for a small village.But that still leaves 10 of the territory\u2019s remote communities dependent on winter roads and ice bridges across lakes, rivers and permafrost, delicate ground that has been frozen for thousands of years. Keeping those roads solid requires constant maintenance by crews with the fortitude to endure hours of toil in the arctic elements.On a recent visit to the territory, the temperature was minus 18 degrees Fahrenheit and falling as our truck drove smoothly across Marian Lake, 21 miles of snow-covered frozen water. The stretch is part of the 285-mile Tlicho Winter Road, which links remote communities to Yellowknife, the territorial capital.Michael Conway, who supervises ice-road crews in the North Slave region, turned off the truck, got out and brushed aside some snow to reveal more than three feet of gleaming ice beneath. In the almost extraterrestrial silence of arctic winter, a deep pop could be heard below, like the bursting of a distant balloon. A few seconds later came a crackling sound like a candy-bar wrapper being crushed.\u201cIce is like a living thing,\u201d Mr. Conway said. \u201cIt breathes.\u201dA generation ago, he said, the lake would naturally freeze thick enough for crews to drive a plow across it without concern. But in recent years, the warmer autumns and deeper snow, which acts as an insulator, have made for much thinner natural lake ice, making road construction a cautious slog and delaying openings to traffic.To ensure that the roads are safe, road crews now use ground-penetrating radar to check the ice\u2019s exact thickness. When it is too thin, they bore a hole for a hose and then spray torrents of lake water out over the surface to freeze and build up additional layers of ice.Mr. Conway said that even those precautions were not always enough. \u201cA guy parked on the ice overnight,\u201d he said, \u201cand when he came back in the morning, his truck was gone.\u201dAbout 30 miles ahead, deep in the forest, white ptarmigan birds watched as a crew built up the winter road over spongy permafrost for a path toward Whati, an indigenous community of 500 people.Clint Westergard, 59, was one of the luckier men, cozy in the heated cab of a snowplow equipped with tracks for use in subzero weather. He has been building winter roads for 30 years, work that takes him and his crew away from home and into the frigid wilderness for weeks, sleeping in work camps between shifts. \u201cSome people can\u2019t handle the isolation,\u201d he said over the roar of the machine.Yet even permanent roads are not immune to the shifting climate. On the region\u2019s main highway back to Yellowknife, entire guardrails have sunk into the roadbed, and a ribbon of asphalt that was once entirely flat now swells and dips because of thawing permafrost.With a harrowing winter coming to an end, ice-road truckers are wondering how many more years they will be able to stay above water.\u201cThis has been one of most difficult and challenging seasons we\u2019ve ever faced,\u201d said Mark Kohaykewych, president of Polar Industries, whose fleet of 42 trucks hauls freight across northern Manitoba, Ontario and Alberta. About three-quarters of those journeys are on winter roads, he said.Mr. Kohaykewych has been in the ice-road trucking business for eight years, but only in the last two has he had to divert winter cargoes to airports because of unseasonable weather. Freak rainstorms made several ice roads unusable for a while in February, he said, and he spent the first weekend in April rescuing a stranded trucker\u2019s rig that had broken through lake ice.But at least the truckers can drive away. \u201cThe communities are the ones really suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout ice roads, how will they fix homes or build schools?

{"Headline": "Trump Couple, Now White House Employees, Can\u2019t Escape Conflict Laws", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The husband-and-wife team of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, now both senior federal government officials, has been alongside President Trump as the White House has hosted dozens of chief executives and a handful of world leaders in recent weeks.It is a rarefied crowd, one that has included the top executives of some of the world\u2019s largest automobile, airline, chemical, pharmaceutical and tech companies. Mr. Kushner will continue to keep such select company now that he has helped create a new office that Mr. Trump is calling the White House Office of American Innovation.Unlike Mr. Trump, who is exempt from conflict of interest laws, both Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump \u2014 who took a formal White House position this past week \u2014 are forbidden under federal criminal and civil law to take any action that might benefit their particular financial holdings.\u201cDonald Trump can evade legal responsibility even if the conflicts of interest remain,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit group. \u201cHis daughter and son-in-law don\u2019t have that escape hatch.\u201dMr. Kushner did resign from more than 200 positions in the partnerships and limited liability companies that make up the family-run multibillion-dollar real estate business. But the financial disclosure report shows that Mr. Kushner will remain a beneficiary of most of those same entities.Jamie Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general at the Justice Department during the Clinton administration and is now advising Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump on government ethics issues, said that the couple could continue to hold on to so many of their assets because most of the value is tied up in buildings.The mystery behind many real estate investments involving foreigners prompted the Treasury Department last year to push for additional disclosures as a way to combat money laundering.While Mr. Kushner may face a potential ethical minefield, the disclosure form makes it difficult to determine exactly where those mines might be situated. The form, which runs 54 pages and lists hundreds of entities, reveals few details about the underlying investments that make up the Kushner empire, such as the addresses of buildings, sources of financing and names of partners.John Pudner, a conservative who has helped elect Tea Party candidates to Congress and now runs a nonprofit group called Take Back Our Republic, said that Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump, if they wanted to serve in the White House, would have been better off if they had taken the difficult step of liquidating their holdings.\u201cA win-win for the president\u2019s family and everyone else is if there were no question anytime a decision is made that it\u2019s being done for the good of the country,\u201d he said.Mr. Kushner, by contrast, continues to hold multimillion-dollar lines of credit from institutions such as Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, while companies he is still a beneficiary of have billions of dollars in additional loans from heavily regulated institutions.Richard W. Painter, who served as a White House ethics lawyer in the Bush administration, said that Mr. Kushner\u2019s financial holdings would complicate any interactions he might have with such banks. \u201cThe one thing Jared really ought to stay completely away from is anything having to do with Dodd-Frank,\u201d Mr. Painter said, referring to the 2010 law that increased capital reserve requirements and instituted many other regulatory changes that affected the nation\u2019s banks.Mr. Kushner, who frequently speaks with world leaders and is tasked with overseeing Middle East peace negotiations, also has an unsecured line of credit worth as much as $5 million from Israel Discount Bank. Kushner Companies has also taken out at least four loans from Bank Hapoalim, Israel\u2019s largest bank, though they are not disclosed in the filing. That firm is the subject of a Justice Department investigation into whether it helped wealthy Americans evade taxes with undeclared accounts.Another potential conflict rests in Ms. Trump\u2019s continued stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, a project that has drawn protests from ethics experts who worry that people representing special interests could stay there or host events there to gain influence with the White House, which is just a few blocks away.Discussions about changes in federal tax law \u2014 a major agenda item for Mr. Trump that could affect issues such as depreciation on Mr. Kushner\u2019s buildings and clothing imported for Ms. Trump\u2019s brand \u2014 could also pose problems, or force them to recuse themselves from participating.\u201cThey are going to have to walk a fine line between matters they are involved with financially and the policies they are helping create and legislation they may be advocating,\u201d said Scott H. Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group.The federal ethics regulations formally prohibit federal employees from being involved in any \u201cparticular matter that will have a direct effect on a financial interest, if there is a close causal link between any decision or action to be taken in the matter and any expected effect of the matter on the financial interest.\u201dThe disclosures by Mr. Kushner and other White House officials released on Friday demonstrate just how complicated it is going to be to police these rules, given the vast and extremely complex financial assets not only within the Trump family but also among dozens of aides they have selected.The National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, as well as the top White House aides Christopher P. Liddell and Reed Cordish, collectively reported assets with a maximum value of more than $1 billion. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, reported assets worth as much as $53.9 million. Even Mr. Bannon\u2019s aide Julia Hahn, who is 25, reported investments worth between $1 million and $2.1 million, according to a tally by The New York Times, while Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, had assets worth between $11 million and $44 million.Some of those financial holdings are already creating questions.Mr. Liddell, an assistant to the president and the director of strategic initiatives, has participated in White House meetings since January that involved several companies in which he continued at least through February to own stock in, including International Paper and General Motors.Mr. Bannon disclosed more than $500,000 in income from entities linked to the hedge fund manager Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah Mercer, major Republican donors who were crucial figures in Mr. Bannon\u2019s appointment as the Trump campaign\u2019s chief executive last year.\u201cThe White House staff\u2019s massive businesses are creating so many possible conflicts of interest it seems almost impossible for them to avoid running into trouble as they mix their former business interests with their new professional duties,\u201d Mr. Bookbinder said.Eric Lipton reported from Washington, and Jesse Drucker from New York. Maggie Haberman, Andrew W. Lehren and Sarah Cohen contributed reporting from New York, and Jeremy Bowers from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Farewell, Daniel Tarullo Offers Fixes on Bank Regulation", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneMuch to the relief of Wall Street executives, who feared and hated him in equal measure, Daniel K. Tarullo left his powerful perch on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors last week, but not before delivering one last lecture on how big banks should be regulated in his absence.His swan song was pretty surprising, all things considered. It also went largely unnoticed, much like Mr. Tarullo himself during his eight years at the Federal Reserve. Many people have never heard of him, even though his decisions affected their lives in ways big and small.Once described as the \u201cWizard of Oz,\u201d for the power he wielded behind the scenes, Mr. Tarullo was appointed to the Federal Reserve by President Barack Obama in January 2009. At the Fed, Mr. Tarullo took over the important responsibility of regulating the big Wall Street banks, a job that, understandably, had been the purview of the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The oversight moved to Washington from New York in the wake of the financial crisis.In a speech at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University on April 4, his penultimate day in office, Mr. Tarullo reiterated the importance of many of his singular policy achievements \u2014 including requiring banks to have more capital and to undergo annual stress tests \u2014 and then he made some news.First, he acknowledged that the Dodd-Frank Act, which re-regulated Wall Street at length (and to a fault) in 2010, was a compromise among those lawmakers who wanted to break up the big banks in the wake of the financial crisis and those who wanted to leave the status quo in place.He said Dodd-Frank \u201cforgoes structural solutions\u201d \u2014 such as breaking up the banks or reimposing the separation of investment and commercial banking \u2014 \u201cwhich might have been cleaner conceptually, but much more complicated as a practical matter.\u201dInstead, he said, Dodd-Frank \u201cimposes a host of restrictions and requirements\u201d on banks, including on counterparty credit limits, risk retention rules, incentive compensation restraints and wind-up resolution planning, while also requiring big banks to increase their capital and reduce their leverage.Given the law\u2019s complexity, he said, it is no surprise Dodd-Frank hasn\u2019t worked exactly as planned and has caused continuing consternation at banks, both large and small, in trying to comply.Normally, Congress would have passed another law, months later, correcting what Dodd-Frank got wrong, he said. But that did not happen because of \u201cpartisan divisions\u201d in Congress.In his speech, he offered up some fixes, including increasing beyond $50 billion in assets the threshold for banks that are labeled \u201csystematically important\u201d and require additional Fed oversight. He also said $10 billion in assets was too low a threshold to require banks to do their own stress tests. And he conceded that local and community banks should not be subject to the same Dodd-Frank requirements as the big banks. (The requirements are \u201cquite burdensome on the very limited compliance capabilities of these small banks,\u201d he said.)His most unexpected statement, though, was to acknowledge that the Volcker Rule, named after Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, was a mistake. The Volcker Rule essentially seeks to prevent big banks from engaging in proprietary trading.Mr. Tarullo said that when Mr. Volcker proposed it, he thought it could add to the \u201csafety and soundness of large financial firms.\u201d But now, \u201cseveral years of experience have convinced me\u201d that as drafted, it \u201cis too complicated\u201d and consumes \u201ctoo many supervisory, as well as bank, resources.\u201dMr. Tarullo also said that the rule could be having \u201ca deleterious effect\u201d on \u201cmarket making\u201d \u2014 the buying and selling of stocks and bonds on behalf of clients \u2014 \u201cparticularly for some less liquid issues.\u201d He even conceded, albeit in a footnote to the written text of the speech, that the new capital requirements have \u201cimpinged somewhat on market liquidity\u201d for Treasury securities, supposedly the most liquid security on Earth, causing the buying and selling of them to be less efficient and more costly. This has long been a complaint of the big players in the market for Treasury securities.Some of his prescriptions, of course, remain dubious at best. He still seems to think that his stress tests \u2014 essentially war gaming for big banks \u2014 will be a useful Baedeker during the next, inevitable financial crisis. But if we\u2019ve learned anything about financial crises, they do not follow any established playbook or resemble anything that has occurred previously.A better solution to bad behavior on Wall Street, in my mind, is changing what bankers, traders and executives get rewarded to do. Make them have their full net worth on the line again, and their behavior will change in a hurry.To his credit, however, as Mr. Tarullo leaves the stage, his parting wisdom is worth remembering as we head into a period where Mr. Trump will probably use a sledgehammer to blow up banking regulations instead of the scalpel that is more appropriate.\u201cAs proposals for regulatory change swirl about,\u201d Mr. Tarullo concluded, \u201cit is crucial that the strong capital regime be maintained, especially as it applies to the most systemically important banks. Neither regulators nor legislators should agree to changes that would effectively weaken that regime, whether directly or indirectly. It would be tragic if the lessons of the financial crisis were forgotten so quickly.\u201dAmen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bull Markets Don\u2019t Mean Extra Jobs for Wall Street", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byBull markets aren\u2019t what they used to be, at least when it comes to New York\u2019s economy.Although the stock market is surging and profits on Wall Street last year hit their highest level since 2012, the good times are not translating into jobs the way they did a decade ago, before the financial crisis and the Great Recession hit.Employment in the securities industry in New York City has risen for three straight years. But, at 177,000, there are still 10,000 fewer jobs in the sector than in 2008. And even if the stock market keeps rising and shares of behemoths like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continue to hit postcrisis highs, don\u2019t expect a surge in hiring on the Street.\u201cThe securities industry is still a pretty important source of very highly paid, very highly skilled jobs, but it\u2019s not really contributing to growth in the number of jobs,\u201d said William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.To be sure, financial services and banking remain a key part of the overall economy in the tristate area. The financial services and securities industry is the largest private-sector contributor to tax revenue in New York State.What economists call the \u2018\u2018multiplier effect\u2019\u2019 is especially high for finance jobs, since annual bonuses for bankers end up in the pockets of people like contractors, gardeners, jewelers, car dealers and real estate brokers.What is more, Wall Street remains crucial for the region\u2019s tax base, especially for New York State. The securities industry accounted for 18.5 percent of Albany\u2019s tax revenues last year, and about 7 percent of the city\u2019s tax haul.But as is the case for the rest of the country, the financial sector is no longer quite as dominant as it once was in New York, Mr. Dudley said. Finance has not gotten smaller; instead other sectors, like technology, have grown much faster since the financial crisis.Mr. Dudley added that \u201cNew York\u2019s economy has become more diversified,\u201d citing strong growth in the technology, hospitality and tourism sectors. He said that with roughly 150,000 workers, the tech sector in New York City is quickly catching up with total employment in the securities industry.\u201cNew York is no longer a one-horse town when it comes to what drives the economy,\u201d said Chris Jones, senior vice president at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit research group that focuses on the tristate area. \u201cTourism and technology have generated more jobs in the last decade and helped to diversify the economy.\u201dAnd while bonuses on Wall Street still dwarf those in other industries, annual payouts are also well below what they were before 2008, when Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns still existed.The average bonus for the securities industry in New York City last year stood at $138,210, compared with a high of $191,360 in 2006, according to New York State\u2019s comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli.The sector\u2019s healthy profits ($17.3 billion in 2016) come at a price. \u201cPart of how they\u2019ve kept profits up is that they\u2019ve kept head count down,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said.In fact, the securities industry accounted for just 6 percent of newly created high-paying jobs from 2010 to 2015, compared with 25 percent in the 1990s and 2000s. \u201cWall Street is still an important contributor to the economy, but I wouldn\u2019t expect a lot of growth in employment,\u201d Mr. Dudley said.Very low interest rates for years have also taken a toll, reducing profit margins at big banks, and forcing them to trim head counts and become more efficient.Some jobs also disappeared because the go-go days of huge leverage and light regulation are over, thanks to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms. With higher capital requirements, riskier activities have been pruned back.Even if some of that regulation is reversed, as President Trump has promised, memories of 2008 are likely to curb a return to the days of big bets and crowded trading desks.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of pressure on trading jobs,\u201d said Laila Worrell, a partner at The Boston Consulting Group. \u201cSince 2009, the regulatory climate hasn\u2019t been superconducive for trading volume growth at big financial institutions.\u201dTrading by humans negotiating over the telephone has been replaced by trading via computers transacting in milliseconds.And for jobs that can\u2019t be done by machines, greener and cheaper pastures beckon. While New York State recorded a 5 percent rise in securities industry jobs from 2010 to 2015, employment in the sector increased by 50 percent in Pennsylvania and 33 percent in Texas over the same period.On the other hand, New York could stand to benefit if financial firms exit London in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote last summer to exit the European Union, the so-called Brexit.New York and London have been rivals in the financial world for decades, with London\u2019s location and especially its time zone an advantage for traders dealing with Europe and Asia. Hedge funds expanded in the British capital, too, and some American policy makers feared London might overtake Wall Street.Experts cite locales like Paris, Luxembourg and Frankfurt as alternatives to London, but Mr. Dudley said, \u201cNew York is a potential place where people could ultimately move jobs, and the city could absorb them relatively easily.\u201dThere are also a few niches in New York where head count is growing rapidly, like financial technology, with new hires creating software and applications for banks and brokerages, and designing trading strategies using algorithms and artificial intelligence.\u201cNew York has become the world\u2019s leading center for financial tech innovation,\u201d Ms. Worrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s surpassed Silicon Valley because the financial institutions these companies serve are in New York. Proximity is very important.\u201dWhile the packed trading desks portrayed in 1980s classics like Oliver Stone\u2019s movie \u201cWall Street\u201d or the book \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d by author Michael Lewis may be a thing of the past, not everyone misses that world.Indeed, Mr. Dudley, an economist who joined Goldman Sachs in 1986 and spent more than two decades at the firm, said Wall Street\u2019s flatter trajectory is fine with him.\u201cThe financial services industry is in a pretty good place right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite rock \u2019n\u2019 roll like we had in 2005 and 2006, but I don\u2019t think we want to go back to that period. I would take a more boring financial industry if it helped create a more stable U.S. economy.\u201dMr. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, acknowledged that nearly a decade after the financial crisis, Wall Street remains unpopular in some quarters. But even if the big banks employ fewer of the masters of the universe than they once did, their outsize paychecks still ultimately benefit residents of the city and state.\u201cPeople have mixed opinions about Wall Street, but love \u2019em or hate \u2019em, it\u2019s still a big part of the city\u2019s economy,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said. \u201cWe want New York to continue to be the capital of global finance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Rise on a Wave of Shareholder Optimism", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTesla\u2019s shareholders have driven off into La-La Land.For all his success, though, Mr. Musk has also routinely missed production targets in recent years. Even so, Tesla now trades at some 28 times estimated earnings in 2020. By then Mr. Musk expects to be producing one million cars a year, up from around 100,000 in 2017.That will require a huge ramp-up in production, which is no easy feat. Also, that valuation multiple suggests Tesla will either keep growing quickly or else generate pretax margins around the 30 percent that Silicon Valley stalwarts Apple and Google achieve rather than the 10 percent that counts as decent in the auto industry \u2014 or maybe both.It\u2019s hard to see that happening, at least without major setbacks along the way.Long-term guesstimates from Morgan Stanley\u2019s auto analysts show a standard-looking car company \u2014 and they have been among Tesla\u2019s most bullish followers. They don\u2019t see output reaching one million cars until around 2027. By 2030, they reckon the company\u2019s pretax margin could be about 14 percent, with some $11 billion of profit.Another way to assess these numbers is to discount the projected 2030 earnings back to this year at a rule-of-thumb 10 percent annual rate. Tesla\u2019s current valuation is about 18 times that discounted profit figure.It\u2019s a somewhat arbitrary analysis, but it may hint at what some investors are hoping for. Take Apple in 2004. Back then, the future iPhone maker was trading at just 65 percent of expected earnings this year, discounted back. In other words, Steve Jobs unleashed growth that blew projections away.If Mr. Musk is riding another wave of consumer change \u2014 a shift toward electric cars \u2014 it could be less drastic than the smartphone revolution and still pay off for Tesla\u2019s investors.That\u2019s possible.

{"Headline": "Two Books Offer Unconventional and Divergent Approaches to Investing", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byOff the ShelfRic Edelman disappoints in his new investing book, left. Gary Smith offers financial formulas to help identify value stocks in his new book, \u201cMoney Machine.\u201dWith the stock market up substantially since the first of the year, and technological innovations continuing to roil the corporate landscape, how should you invest right now?Two new books offer very different answers, with each taking an unconventional approach.In the far better one, \u201cMoney Machine: The Surprisingly Simple Power of Value Investing\u201d (Amacom, $27.95), Gary Smith, a Pomona College economics professor, says you should concentrate on value stocks. In contrast, in \u201cThe Truth About Your Future: The Money Guide You Need Now, Later and Much Later\u201d (Simon & Schuster $26), Ric Edelman says you need to figure out how to capitalize on trends disrupting how business is typically done.Let\u2019s begin with Mr. Smith, who does an excellent job explaining his position.\u201cInstead of trying to predict short-term zigs and zags in stock prices, value investors evaluate individual stocks and the market as a whole by looking for good companies that have low stock prices relative to their dividends, earnings and assets,\u201d he writes.Mr. Smith uses an analogy to make his case.\u201cThink of a stock as a machine that generates cash every few months \u2014 cash that happens to be called dividends,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe key question is how much you would pay to own that machine in order to get the cash. This is the stock\u2019s intrinsic value. Value investors buy a stock because it is an inexpensive money machine, generating bountiful cash it is hoped over many years.\u201dThroughout the book, Mr. Smith provides financial formulas to help you identify value stocks, and his writing is clear and often clever. For example:The book, however, does have its flaws \u2014 one major, a couple minor.The big one first: It is perfectly defensible to pick one approach to investing \u2014 such as loading up on value stocks, companies with solid revenues, earnings and dividends that are trading at a relatively low price \u2014 over all others. As Mr. Smith points out a number of times, Warren E. Buffett is a value investor. And this reviewer understands that Mr. Buffett has done quite well.But financial mavens like Mr. Buffett, the maestro of Berkshire Hathaway, are rare, and as Mr. Smith himself points out, \u201cvery few investors think they are below average, even though half are.\u201d Most of us would be better off with a widely diversified portfolio, something Mr. Smith barely acknowledges.As for the minor nits, Mr. Smith tends to digress, mentioning academic papers he wrote that are at best tangential to the concept of value investing. For example, he says that stocks with ingenious ticker symbols, such as MOO for VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF, tend to outperform the market. That is a fun fact \u2014 especially for us financial nerds \u2014 but I am not sure what it has to do with the matter at hand, and I would not recommend an investment based solely on a cute name.Similarly, while it is possible that a home could be viewed as a value investment, as he explains, I am not sure the discussion was worth 20 pages of a 300-page book.These are small quibbles. For the most part, he states his case well.\u201cThe value-investing philosophy is simple,\u201d he writes. \u201cLook for great companies whose stocks are inexpensive relative to their dividends and earnings.\u201dThat clarity and brevity are lacking in Mr. Edelman\u2019s book. He is a financial planner, but readers expecting detailed investment advice will be disappointed.For example, after writing that it is vital to diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, cash and perhaps other investments such as real estate, how does Mr. Edelman respond to his rhetorical question \u201chow much of your portfolio should be placed into each\u201d of those assets?Like this: \u201cThe answer is \u2026 it depends. I wish I could provide you a more specific answer right now, but this is just a book on personal finance \u2014 it\u2019s not a private, in-depth meeting with a financial planning professional.\u201dHe doesn\u2019t even offer general guidelines. He just moves on.This is already my pick for the most frustrating personal finance book of 2017. And one of the reasons I am so annoyed is that the premise was so promising.\u201cFinancial planning is all about anticipating and preparing for the future,\u201d Mr. Edelman writes. \u201cSo to understand what your future will be like, you need to understand why it\u2019s going to be so radically different from what you have been assuming.\u201dHe then devotes about two-thirds of his more than 300 pages to underscoring things we know but can easily forget: Medical advances could make us live longer, ever-evolving technology will provide more engaging entertainment options, and rapidly evolving workplaces will require continuous education, perhaps extensive enough for us to have to leave the workplace for a while to concentrate on learning new things.So far, so good. But what do these changes mean for the way we invest? Well, when it comes to leisure and learning, for example, Mr. Edelman\u2019s advice is just this: \u201cExpect to spend lots of money on travel and recreation \u2014 and this will need to be factored into your financial plan.\u201d How? There are no details.About as specific as he gets is to say: \u201cInvest in a globally diversified portfolio. Maintain that portfolio for a very long time. Strategically rebalance the portfolio as needed,\u201d and \u201cinclude companies that are using or developing exponential technologies.\u201dThe \u201cwhat\u201d to invest in, how much of your portfolio it should represent, and what\u2019s \u201ca very long time\u201d are left to you. That isn\u2019t much help when you are trying to determine how to invest today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.D.P. Report Shows U.S. Economy Off to Slow Start in 2017", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byAmericans say they feel more optimistic about the economy since President Trump was elected. But they certainly are not acting that way, and that is shaping up to be a challenge for his administration.The caution among consumers was particularly notable on big purchases like automobiles. Other indicators were stronger \u2014 businesses invested at a healthy pace \u2014 but that was not enough to offset the headwinds from feeble retail sales and falling inventories.The softness last quarter also provides crucial ammunition for the Trump administration\u2019s arguments that big tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks are necessary for the economy to grow the way it did in the 1980s and 1990s.Tax cuts, regulatory relief, trade renegotiations and an unfettered energy sector are needed \u201cto overcome the dismal economy inherited by the Trump administration,\u201d said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. \u201cBusiness and consumer sentiment is strong, but both must be released from the regulatory and tax shackles constraining economic growth.\u201dThe first-quarter fade is also sure to be noticed by the Federal Reserve as it contemplates whether to proceed with two more interest-rate increases planned for this year.Federal Reserve policy makers are set to meet next week, and while there is little expectation that an interest-rate increase will be announced when the meeting ends on Wednesday, the latest economic reading could sway the Fed\u2019s outlook. The monthly report on job creation is due next Friday, and a strong showing could ease some of the concern over the lack of vigor in the first quarter.The job market has proved remarkably resilient even as quarterly growth has wobbled, and the unemployment rate sank to 4.5 percent in March, the lowest in nearly a decade.Reaffirming its recent findings, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index finished April with a decidedly bullish reading of 97, up from 87.2 just before the election.The White House provided a statement saying the report on gross domestic product might have been influenced by seasonal factors, but \u201cshows that we still have work to do to get the economic growth President Trump wants and expects.\u201dAnd in an interview with Fox News on Friday, Mr. Trump said that, with better trade deals, the United States should be able to lift the rate of economic growth to 5 percent or more in a few years.With personal consumption accounting for nearly 70 percent of all economic activity, however, the administration will be hard pressed to lift growth substantially if consumers remain cautious about opening their wallets.Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Obama, said he found the disconnect between findings of optimism and actual behavior puzzling, though he added, \u201cIt\u2019s possible it was a blip.\u201dOn the other hand, something more significant may be happening. The rising cost of necessities like health care, housing and education is crowding out discretionary spending for middle-class Americans, said Stephanie Pomboy, founder of MacroMavens, an independent economics consulting firm in New York.And the tax cuts the administration is proposing are unlikely to reverse that trend, she added.\u201cConsumers aren\u2019t spending out of desire but out of obligation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I believe that since the recession and the bursting of the housing bubble, the middle class wants to save. They don\u2019t want to get back into the position they were in after 2008.\u201dShe noted that although the Obama administration got temporary tax breaks through Congress as part of its stimulus package in 2009, tax credits and other incentives did not substantially increase consumer spending.Ms. Pomboy was among the earliest voices warning that a burst of first-quarter momentum was unlikely, and she is similarly cautious about the rest of 2017. \u201cThere are a lot of moving parts to this report for the first quarter, but none suggest we should look for an acceleration in growth going forward,\u201d she said.The initial weakness this year does follow a pattern of sluggish annual starts since the recovery began, when momentum has picked up in subsequent quarters.When growth is measured year over year, rather than quarter over quarter, the latest data reveal a 1.9 percent annual growth rate, which is almost identical to the broader trend of the postrecession period.Most economists on Wall Street are looking for a rebound over the rest of 2017, with growth rising to about 3 percent in the current quarter.\u201cWe see ebbs and flows in consumer spending, and it\u2019s still on an upward trend,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. Noting that consumption rose sharply in mid- to late 2016, Mr. Anderson suggested some payback was probably inevitable.While he is more sanguine about the economy\u2019s prospects than Ms. Pomboy is, Mr. Anderson shares her skepticism about the impact White House policy will have.\u201cThe reality, as we have seen in the first 100 days, is that it\u2019s a lot harder for the administration to achieve their policy goals and deal with Congress than they probably thought during the campaign,\u201d he said.\u201cEven if you are president of the United States, you have to deal with 535 individuals with different constituencies and agendas on Capitol Hill,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like running a commercial real estate company where everyone has to march to the same drummer.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been a believer in the \u2018Trump bump\u2019 for this year,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re in the same economy we\u2019ve been in all along.\u201dAdvertisement"}

President Trump has surrounded himself with an extraordinarily wealthy group of advisers, who have sprawling assets and income sources. Here are some intriguing highlights from their financial disclosure forms:The director of the National Economic Council and a former Goldman Sachs executive, he is among the wealthiest of the president\u2019s advisers, with assets worth as much as $611 million. He owns stock in Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, McDonald\u2019s and the food giant Kraft Heinz, and has at least $191.1 million in Goldman-related holdings. He and his wife reported at least $48 million to $78 million in income last year.She is best known for her once-ubiquitous cable television appearances, but Ms. Conway has earned significant money through speechmaking and consulting. Among the groups that paid her last year were the National RIfle Association, the National Right to Life Committee, the Tea Party Patriots and the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group that gained notoriety in 2015 when it secretly recorded a video that purported to show Planned Parenthood officials trying to profit from the sale of fetal tissue. She and her husband, a lawyer, are worth at least $11 million to $44 million, the records show.His real estate interests are vast \u2014 with properties in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana and Maryland \u2014 but he still carries a lot of debt. Mr. Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, has at least $19 million worth of debt from various banks, as well as $115,000 worth of debt on two Visa credit cards, at a 13.74 percent interest rate. He and his wife, Ivanka Trump, are beneficiaries of a real estate and investment portfolio worth as much as $740 million.

{"Headline": "An Activist Investment in Whole Foods Exposes Shifting Power on Wall St.", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byAs a steward of pension funds and retirement accounts, Neuberger Berman has traditionally employed a staid strategy familiar among big Wall Street money managers: Buy and hold stocks, sit back, and hope for the best.But recently, the firm has eschewed its nearly 80-year-old tactic of playing nice. Instead it turned to the bare-knuckled world of activist investors made famous by the likes of Carl C. Icahn and William A. Ackman.Last year, as Neuberger Berman\u2019s roughly $200 million investment in Whole Foods Market languished, the firm quietly approached some hedge funds and urged them to agitate for change at the high-end grocer.Two weeks ago, Jana Partners took up the fight.Neuberger Berman\u2019s behind-the-scenes campaign to shake up Whole Foods is the latest example of a dynamic that is upending relations between public companies and the big investors that own their stock.For decades, Neuberger Berman \u2014 which invests some $267 billion for pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and individuals \u2014 and peers like T. Rowe Price and BlackRock were reluctant to rock the boat at the companies they invested in. Agitating for change was left to the activist hedge fund managers like Mr. Icahn and Mr. Ackman, rabble-rousers with a reputation for shaking up companies, raising their stock prices and making big profits.Traditional money managers in search of market-beating returns are demanding a seat at the table, turning to activists for help and even employing some hedge fund tricks of their own. And activists, once the black sheep of the investment world, are now accepted as regular, if meddlesome, investors.Do companies \u201creally listen to the feedback they get from their mainstream investors?\u201d said Michelle Edkins, global head of corporate governance at BlackRock. \u201cI think they are certainly making an effort to listen more.\u201dBut activists, she added, \u201ccan act as an important \u2018check and balance\u2019 on management that has lost its way.\u201dBefore Neuberger Berman approached the activists, it talked to Whole Foods representatives and made its case for change. While the company undertook some reforms \u2014 for one, scrapping its dual-chief-executive structure in November \u2014 the conversations yielded little effect on the company\u2019s dwindling share price.So Neuberger Berman executives prepared an inch-thick presentation, the kind of document usually produced by activists. It took broad aim at Whole Foods, criticizing everything from its cozy board and wilting produce to its pricey real estate in well-heeled neighborhoods like Columbus Circle, where Whole Foods has a store in the Time Warner Center \u2014 one of the most expensive retail spaces in New York City. With that in hand, they approached several hedge funds, including Starboard Value and Elliott Management.Before long, Jana was amassing shares of Whole Foods. On April 10, as it unveiled its stake in the company, it ticked off a list of complaints that echoed Neuberger Berman\u2019s concerns: The brand was suffering, customer service was lagging and the company needed fresh blood on the board.Jana declined to comment.Neuberger Berman declined to comment about its interactions with hedge funds regarding Whole Foods, but said the firm was willing to take a more active role in certain situations. \u201cWe have engaged with the company quite aggressively over the course of the last period of time,\u201d said Joseph Amato, president and chief investment officer of Neuberger Berman, referring to Whole Foods.Earlier this week, Neuberger Berman sent a letter to the board of directors at Whole Foods, praising it for undertaking \u201cpositive changes\u201d in recent months. But Neuberger Berman also strongly urged the board to consider a potential sale of the company or a merger or alliance with another company, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by The New York Times.Relations between institutional investors and activists have evolved in recent years, and it is not unheard-of for big investors to support activists who have set their sights on a high-profile company. In 2013, T. Rowe Price teamed up with Mr. Icahn to oppose a leveraged buyout of Dell.Neuberger Berman has taken a more confrontational approach before. Last year it campaigned for change at another company in which it had invested, the technology company Ultratech. It secured two board seats, but the process, Mr. Amato said, was \u201cin all honesty expensive and time-consuming.\u201dIn the case of Whole Foods, Neuberger Berman lobbied for the activists to do the messy work of battling the company in public.But it is less common for an institutional investor to share its work on a specific target with activists in the way Neuberger Berman did with Whole Foods. Mr. Ackman has described receiving occasional calls from institutional investors hoping to pique his interest in a company. There is even a term for the interplay: \u201cR.F.A.s\u201d or \u201crequests for activism.\u201dFor many large shareholders, the 2008 financial crisis was the turning point that led to greater collaboration with activists. Investors watched as the value of their stock portfolios plummeted.At the same time, activists, who at times could be brash, have softened their images. Third Point\u2019s Daniel S. Loeb \u2014 once famous for the verbal invective that he lobbed at chief executives \u2014 has opted more recently for the quiet approach of complimenting executives but emphasizing \u201cundervalued\u201d aspects of their businesses. In a letter to investors two years ago he sought to dispel the notion that activists were \u201chit and run\u201d investors.\u201cIt might surprise people to hear that we completely agree that the sort of activism they describe is abominable,\u201d he wrote.In the case of Whole Foods, Jana has focused on a broad range of issues with the business \u2014 which has earned the nickname \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d for its expensive products. It pointed to failures in how Whole Foods handled its brand development, and to what it said were customer service deficiencies and a poor strategy for distribution.Once the vanguard of the natural and organic food movement, Whole Foods now faces competition from big-name grocers like Safeway and Costco that have started to offer similar organic products at lower prices.As its share price slid last year, Whole Foods cut its prices, offered promotions and started a loyalty program. After Jana\u2019s announcement, the company said it was \u201ccommitted to driving value for all Whole Foods Market shareholders and will continue to act to achieve this important objective.\u201dBut analysts have speculated the company could be a takeover target, which would result in a big payday for Jana, Neuberger Berman and other investors. A flurry of reports of takeover interest \u2014 the supermarket chain Albertsons and the e-commerce giant Amazon are reported to have explored bids \u2014 has helped to lift the share price.Charles Kantor, who oversees Neuberger Berman\u2019s investment in Whole Foods, said that the company had \u201ca phenomenal brand and had executed the difficult things,\u201d but that \u201cthey haven\u2019t done well with the basic Retail 101.\u201dMr. Kantor said it was normal for his group to speak with other investors. But, he added, \u201cWe\u2019ve never made an investment predicated on an activist showing up.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Saw a Trump Bump, Then Hit a Speed Bump", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byThe Trump bump in the stock market ran into trouble when the Republican effort to \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare\u201d foundered in Congress and the Federal Reserve increased interest rates, raising doubts that developments in Washington would treat the markets as kindly for the rest of the year as they appear to have done right after Election Day.Stocks had recorded a succession of highs in the hope that President Trump\u2019s proposals for significant infrastructure spending, reduced regulation and an overhaul of the tax code would be enacted and be good for business.But then, the market became choppier.\u201cThe realization is setting in that even with a Republican White House and congressional majority, it doesn\u2019t ensure a smooth enactment of legislation,\u201d said Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families. Referring to the decline in March that accelerated after the health care bill showed signs of stalling, she added: \u201cHow much hope was priced in? Well, that much was priced in.\u201dMaybe more than that, according to Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies.\u201cWe need all of the Trump stimulus to take place, and we need a tax cut,\u201d he said, to justify stocks\u2019 trading as high as they are. \u201cI don\u2019t think either is going to take place in a hurry.\u201dIf at all. Robert Arnott, co-manager of the Pimco All Asset Fund, said that while the prospect exists for Mr. Trump to be \u201ca transformational president\u201d who can succeed at \u201cdisentangling the regulatory state, cutting a lot of red tape, making it easier for free enterprise to be free, a lot of that is likely to turn out to be wishful thinking.\u201dIt was wishful enough to take the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index up more than 12 percent between Election Day and the beginning of March. For the first quarter, the benchmark index rose 5.5 percent, closing at 2,362.72.When it comes to the outlook for monetary policy, the thinking is mixed. Ms. Patterson said the Fed\u2019s move last month \u201cwas perceived as an incredibly dovish hike, if that\u2019s not too much of an oxymoron.\u201d That\u2019s because Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, declined to discuss plans for selling trillions of dollars of Treasury instruments and other securities added to the Fed\u2019s balance sheet after the global financial crisis through its quantitative easing program.Mr. Sri-Kumar envisions a more accommodative Fed than is widely expected. The economy will remain too anemic for more than one rate increase a year for the time being, he predicted.Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, counters that central bankers would have to be more assertive because, with the unemployment rate below 5 percent and inflation above 2 percent, \u201cthey have met their policy objectives.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve moved into a base case where it\u2019s not so much that if the data improves, the Fed will consider raising rates,\u201d Mr. Gundlach said. \u201cNow if the data stays where it is, the Fed will raise rates once a quarter. If you look under the hood\u201d at Ms. Yellen\u2019s commentary last month, \u201cit wasn\u2019t that dovish.\u201dTighter monetary policy is ultimately good for long-term government bonds, all else being equal, he said, because it depresses economic growth and inflation. As he put it, \u201cthe long-bond market wants the Fed to destroy the economy.\u201dBut the economy is still doing well enough to keep the 10-year Treasury yield from falling much further, Mr. Gundlach predicted. He foresees it falling to 2.25 percent from 2.4 percent on March 31, before heading close to 3 percent later in the year. He would avoid buying longer-term government debt, therefore, and high-grade corporate bonds, which he said had \u201chuge interest-rate risk.\u201dAs for stocks, they would face pressure from a further rise in bond yields, he warned.\u201cThe argument for stocks has for quite some time been that they\u2019re better than bonds,\u201d Mr. Gundlach said. \u201cAs interest rates move higher, you start to get real competition\u201d for investors\u2019 money. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough environment in the middle of this year with bond yields rising.\u201dIt was a sufficiently favorable environment in the first quarter to send the average domestic stock mutual fund up 4.9 percent, according to Morningstar. Portfolios that focus on technology and health care did especially well, while specialists in industrials and financial services lagged.The average taxable bond fund gained a modest 1.6 percent.Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, contends that the economy is humming along better than many on Wall Street believe and that it makes more sense to attribute the rally in stocks to stronger growth than to a Trump bump.\u201cThe economy and earnings data were getting better before the elections,\u201d Mr. Levkovich said, with measures like new business orders and capital spending already on the rise. \u201cThe Fed was watching all this data, as well,\u201d he added, and that\u2019s why it raised rates in March.His benign economic view leads him to be wary of bonds; he expects a 10-year Treasury yield of 2.6 percent at year\u2019s end, and little opportunity for gains. He encourages investing in stock sectors that are especially sensitive to growth, like energy \u2014 which he said had been underperforming technology almost to the extent that it did during the 2000 tech bubble \u2014 and industrials. He also likes narrower segments like biotechnology and producers of entertainment and media content.Ms. Patterson is less hopeful about the economy and stocks. While she finds that economic and earnings growth \u201ccontinue to look pretty good,\u201d she thinks a downward turn in the cycle is approaching.\u201cWe\u2019ve been neutral on stocks since late spring, and we\u2019ll probably stay neutral until it\u2019s time to go underweight,\u201d she said, adding a caveat: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be too nervous too early.\u201dAlthough she is less hopeful on the economy than Mr. Levkovich, Ms. Patterson likewise favors energy stocks. She also recommends health care and would avoid materials stocks, another economically sensitive sector.\u201cWe went into the year thinking equities were already highly valued and we\u2019re in the latter stages of the economic cycle,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re telling our clients that over the next few years we\u2019ll have positive equity returns, but that they have to manage their expectations.\u201dWith his low expectations for the economy, Mr. Sri-Kumar advises a liberal allocation to Treasury and high-grade corporate bonds, and he would limit exposure to the stock market to defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples.Investors have seldom felt the need to go into a defensive crouch during the eight-year bull run in stocks. The market appears pricey, Mr. Arnott said, based on the CAPE Shiller ratio, which compares share prices to the last 10 years of inflation-adjusted earnings to get a valuation reading that adjusts for the shifts of the economic cycle.\u201cNow, we sit with a Shiller P.E. that briefly touched 29,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty expensive,\u201d more so than at any time in the last century, he said, other than just before the 1929 crash and in the run-up to the popping of the tech bubble in 2000.\u201cThat\u2019s heady company to be keeping,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a slam-dunk formula for a market crash, but it suggests very high odds for long-term anemic returns.\u201dMr. Arnott finds the return prospects much better abroad, with stocks trading at 13 times earnings in Europe and 12 times in emerging markets. As for bonds, local-currency debt in emerging markets yields about 6.5 percent on average, compared with 1.5 percent for a basket of long-term government issues from the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain and France.Emerging markets \u201care priced for deep disappointment,\u201d he said. \u201cAny upside surprise is not priced in.\u201dFunds that invest in emerging stock markets did not disappoint in the first quarter. The average one rose 11.9 percent, helping the average international stock fund to return 7.9 percent.Mr. Gundlach prefers foreign markets for similar reasons. He favors France, where returns have lagged those in other European countries, like Germany and Britain, over the last year. A populist presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, has continued to poll well ahead of French elections that will begin next Sunday, although she is not expected to win.Among emerging markets, he considers India an excellent investment over the very long term. He foresees its economy developing much as China\u2019s has over the last few decades.\u201cWhen foreign markets outperform the U.S., you see tremendous enthusiasm for U.S. investors to diversify, but they\u2019re buying what has already gone up,\u201d Mr. Gundlach said. \u201cIf diversification is prudent, why not do it when you\u2019ve already made big profits on U.S. investments?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lump of Rock, an Otter and a Secessionist", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byShetland Islands JournalSANDNESS, Shetland Islands \u2014 With gray clouds building and rain slanting in over the Atlantic, Stuart Hill pointed to a small lump of land inhabited by an otter, a few seals and a variety of seabirds.Yet, while many Shetlanders regard Mr. Hill as an eccentric, a growing number are being drawn to calls for more independence for their remote and scenic isles.Unleashed by Britain\u2019s planned withdrawal from the European Union, known as Brexit, the debate underscores the forces of fragmentation threatening to turn the United Kingdom into a contradiction in terms.In 2014, Shetland voted against independence for Scotland by 63.7 percent to 36.2 percent in a referendum that rejected separation.But last year\u2019s referendum on Brexit, in which a majority of Scots voted to remain, brought closer another plebiscite on Scottish independence, leaving Shetlanders wondering whether they might be better off controlling their own affairs \u2014 and the lucrative energy reserves and fishing stocks in the seas around them.Shaped by their Viking, rather than Celtic, roots, the Shetlands have a unique culture. Small Shetland ponies are a frequent sight in much of its panoramic landscape, and the red and blue houses of parts of its capital, Lerwick, look more Nordic than British.To this day, however, historians struggle to identify a point at which they became, legally, Scottish. Hence, Mr. Hill\u2019s case that the Shetlands belong neither to Scotland nor to Britain.To critics, discussion of independence for a tiny clutch of islands, while far-fetched, underscores the growing risk of the post-Brexit Balkanization of Britain.\u201cWe have a history of having to push water uphill against Edinburgh,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom London, you get benign neglect, but you get patronized from Edinburgh.\u201dInspecting boxes of haddock and cod at Lerwick\u2019s busy wholesale fish market, Gary Smith, skipper of a trawler, agrees.\u201cI would never say to anybody I am Scottish \u2014 never,\u201d he said.Shetland has its specific concerns, like ferry services and the sustainability of rural schools, he said against the backdrop of a harbor where seals regularly bob to the surface.The way people behave is different too, and generally rather nicer, he added. \u201cThey tolerate more; they are not so volatile,\u201d he said. On Shetland, people cannot avoid one another for long, he said, so before starting an argument that might escalate into a bitter personal feud, you think, \u201cWhy make life difficult for yourself?\u201dYet, collectively, Shetlanders are becoming more argumentative. Given the oil beneath the seabed and the seafood in nearby waters, there is seething resentment that public spending has been reduced.\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling in Shetland that everybody is working and we are paying into the pot, and we are getting shortchanged,\u201d Mr. Smith said. He thinks Mr. Hill has a good historical case, but jokes that he is \u201cprobably about 400 years too late with his argument.\u201dThe Shetland Islands Council has a reserve fund, financed by the oil industry, currently worth a hefty $375 million \u2014 more than $16,000 for every inhabitant \u2014 but there are worries that it is being drained by funding cuts from Edinburgh.At the St. Magnus Bay Hotel she runs in scenic Hillswick, Andrea Manson, a councilor and Wir Shetland supporter, argues that, had the islands won independence decades ago, \u201cwe would have been rich on the same sort of scale as Norway, with millions of pounds in the bank for each person; we would be treated with more respect.\u201dThe dining room is decorated with Viking shields, and Ms. Manson, too, insists that Shetlanders \u201cdon\u2019t think of ourselves as Scottish,\u201d adding, with a laugh, that the islands are \u201ctoo windy for kilts.\u201dThe authorities in Edinburgh calculate that \u201cyear on year, they can cut the grant and somehow we will manage to find the money,\u201d she said.\u201cMaybe what they weren\u2019t expecting was for Wir Shetland to say \u2018enough is enough,\u2019\u201d she said, claiming growing support for independence or at least the status of a British overseas territory, like the Falkland Islands.At Lerwick town hall, Mr. Robinson, the council leader, argues that funding cuts flow from Scotland\u2019s local government formula, rather than political decisions, but he thinks the effects are unfair.The grant has been reduced since 2010 by 23 percent, he said, prompting the loss of 600 of 2,900 council staff members.Mr. Robinson says laws made in Edinburgh or Westminster often fail to fit a rural community, and says he thinks that Brexit and Scotland\u2019s independence debate provide a \u201cpolitical opportunity\u201d to bring more powers to Shetland.As to Mr. Hill, Mr. Robinson thinks there \u201cprobably is a doubt as to the constitutional status of Shetland,\u201d but added that Mr. Hill\u2019s \u201cantics over time have grown to irritate people.\u201dSo difficult to reach is Forvik, which Mr. Hill says means \u201cisland of the bay of sheep,\u201d that he visits only about twice a year, though a shelter he built there in 2008 is still standing. A fount of self-taught legal and historical knowledge, Mr. Hill describes himself as Forvik\u2019s acting first minister.With plans to create a Forvik passport and another attempt to test the authority of Shetland\u2019s court \u2014 this time over planning permission \u2014 Mr. Hill says he thinks he can make the Shetland Islands the epicenter of the \u201cbreakup of monolithic states.\u201dMs. Manson thinks that future generations will erect statues to Mr. Hill, though, right now, even he accepts that he divides opinion.\u201cThere are a lot of people who support what I do, because they know that my heart is in Shetland,\u201d he said, before acknowledging, \u201cThere is the other side that think that I\u2019m just a complete nutter, and that I should go away and mind my own business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Passes Ford in Market Value as Investors Bet on the Future", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 The record pace of auto sales in the United States is slowing down, leaving investors increasingly bearish on auto stocks.But there is one exception. Tesla, the electric-vehicle upstart, continues to surge.On Monday, Tesla surpassed Ford Motor in market value for the first time and moved within striking distance of General Motors, starkly illustrating the growing gap in investors\u2019 optimism over its future versus the prospects for the traditional carmakers from Detroit.While G.M. and Ford may have strong profits and healthy balance sheets, Tesla offers something Wall Street loves much more: the potential for dramatic growth.\u201cInvestors want something that is going to go up in orders of magnitude in six months to six years, and Tesla is that story,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cNobody thinks Ford or G.M. is going to do that.\u201dTesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has shattered the conventional wisdom that automakers should be viewed as a stable, reliable investment. Instead, he promotes his California-based company as a dynamic vehicle for growth, despite the risks and challenges ahead of it.In his vision, Tesla is going to change the world, and is primed to cash in on the two transformative trends in the industry: the shift to electric vehicles as part of a broader societal move to cleaner energy, and the advent of automated driving.\u201cTesla is very vocal in talking about how they are positioned as we move from humans driving cars powered by gasoline to computers driving cars powered by batteries,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.At the end of Monday\u2019s trading, Tesla reached a market capitalization of $48.7 billion compared with Ford\u2019s $45.6 billion, according to Bloomberg. General Motors was at $51.2 billion.That sent stocks in the Detroit automakers down for the day \u2014 G.M. was off 3.4 percent and Ford 1.7 percent \u2014 while Tesla\u2019s stock soared by more than 7 percent.Despite the recent boom years for the American motor industry, in which G.M. and Ford have been the biggest beneficiaries, executives are working overtime just to convince Wall Street that their business model can produce incremental improvements.Mr. Brauer said that reception was unfortunate for G.M. and Ford because \u201cthe reality is, they\u2019re as financially healthy as they\u2019ve ever been, and they\u2019re in very good position for the future.\u201dBoth companies have rebounded steadily since the recession, although G.M. needed a bankruptcy filing and $49 billion government bailout to recover. And both have taken advantage of the pent-up consumer demand for new vehicles in recent years, especially for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.But neither automaker has convinced Wall Street that it has shed its boom-or-bust reputation tied to broader economic cycles, or is at the forefront of new technology being developed for self-driving vehicles and electric cars.The Detroit automakers are hardly sitting still in their efforts to improve current results and future prospects. G.M. made the momentous decision recently to sell its money-losing European division, and Ford is adding jobs to accelerate its shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles. Both automakers have bought technology companies to bolster their in-house engineering expertise, and their executives have embraced the chance to work with the Trump administration on scaling back government regulations.All the same, both companies are ranked near the bottom in price-to-earnings ratios for the companies that make up the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.Last week, one of G.M.\u2019s large investors, the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, proposed the creation of two classes of stock \u2014 one that strictly pays dividends, and a second tied directly to earnings and future growth in areas like self-driving cars and ride-hailing services.G.M. directors flatly rejected the idea as too risky, and the chief executive, Mary Barra, said there was no need to deviate from \u201cexecuting a plan that is delivering record financial and operation results.\u201d Yet while industry analysts generally supported the decision, G.M.\u2019s share price barely budged on the news that it was staying the course.And Monday\u2019s data, showing total industry sales off 1.6 percent, underscored that overall demand for new vehicles is slipping despite a bevy of discounts and incentives. G.M. showed a slight gain from the prior March, while Ford sales fell sharply. Several other automakers, such as Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai, also reported declines.Of course, based on the number of cars actually being made, they are in a different league from Tesla. G.M. sold 256,000 vehicles in the United States last month, and Ford 234,000. Tesla\u2019s sales for the same period: 4,000.But it was the growth and the outlook, not the raw numbers, that moved the markets. Investors tend to look at Tesla as a technology start-up rather than an automaker.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like Tesla is positioned in people\u2019s minds as an energy storage company that happens to put most of its batteries on wheels,\u201d said Andrew Stewart, chief investment officer at Exchange Capital Management, an investment firm in Ann Arbor, Mich.Tesla is also prone to more volatile stock movements because Mr. Musk and other board members and top executives own a large chunk of shares, leaving a relative few that change hands frequently, he said.\u201cWhenever there\u2019s interesting news, the people trying to buy are buying from a limited number of people who are willing to sell,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cWhile you have Ford and G.M., and they\u2019re these decades-old, more-institutional industrial companies.\u201dBecause of Tesla\u2019s acclaim and the limited number of shares being traded, the company draws more individual investors, and its share price tends to spike whenever Tesla or Mr. Musk makes news.This week\u2019s jump in its stock price was set off by a brief news release on Sunday that said Tesla had delivered more than 25,000 cars in the first quarter, exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates.While Tesla may enjoy the favor of investors, it still faces some daunting hurdles to reach its goals. This summer, the company is supposed to start making the Model 3, a compact electric model that Tesla plans to sell for $35,000 and produce in significantly higher volumes. It currently offers two vehicles, the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X S.U.V., both of which sell for $90,000 or more when options are added in. (People who buy its cars benefit from a $7,500 federal tax credit on environmentally friendly cars, a selling point with an uncertain future.)Once Tesla begins producing the Model 3, Mr. Musk expects production to ramp up quickly, with a goal of making 500,000 cars a year by 2018. Achieving that target will not be easy, Mr. Brauer said. \u201cThat\u2019s five times growth in volume,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any car company that\u2019s ever done that in a two-year period.\u201dBill Vlasic reported from Detroit, and Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Different Portraits of a Gambler as a Trader Emerge at Trial", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byThe insider trading trial of William T. Walters drew nearer to a close on Wednesday as defense lawyers presented testimony from the last of their witnesses and federal prosecutors gave closing arguments.Mr. Walters, a colorful Las Vegas sports gambler known as Billy, is facing charges of wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy stemming from his trades of Dean Foods shares from 2008 to 2014. Jurors in Federal District Court in Manhattan, who began hearing evidence on March 16, will hear the closing argument from Mr. Walters\u2019s lawyer on Thursday.Prosecutors have said Mr. Walters used nonpublic information from a Dean board member, Thomas C. Davis, to make $40 million by realizing profits and avoiding losses. At the same time, they said, Mr. Walters arranged for loans of nearly $1 million to the financially troubled Mr. Davis, who repaid only a small portion.\u201cThrough Tom Davis, Billy Walters had a seat in the Dean Foods boardroom,\u201d a prosecutor, Brooke Cucinella, told jurors during her closing argument on Wednesday. \u201cThe defendant knew not only how valuable the secret information he had was, but how illegal it was for him to have it.\u201dThey also suggested that Mr. Walters\u2019s facility in the financial markets stemmed from a professional gambler\u2019s steeliness, with one broker who had worked with him in the 1990s calling him \u201cthe Babe Ruth of risk.\u201dHis current broker, Rob Miller, called Mr. Walters a \u201cvery aggressive\u201d and well-informed investor with a penchant for staking out big positions in certain stocks even when it seemed counterintuitive to do so.\u201cAt times he would talk to me in gambler\u2019s parlance,\u201d Mr. Miller testified. \u201cHe would refer to his investments as bets.\u201dAnother witness for the defense, the controller of Mr. Walters\u2019s company, the Walters Group, testified that Mr. Davis\u2019s debts to Mr. Walters were entered into a ledger and tracked carefully.In the prosecution\u2019s closing argument, Ms. Cucinella focused most closely on the correlation between trades and communications between Mr. Walters and Mr. Davis. She also noted that Mr. Walters often made large trades before significant events were announced by the company.The prosecutor beamed images of phone logs and trading records onto a screen and reminded jurors of trial testimony by an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation who had gone over the timing in detail, saying that Mr. Walters had often traded within moments of communicating with Mr. Davis.One such series of actions, taking place in 2008, appeared to begin with a 10-minute phone call starting at 12:54 p.m. between Mr. Davis and Mr. Walters. Then at 1:05 p.m., Mr. Walters bought 462,200 shares of Dean Foods, for $9.3 million.In 2012, the prosecutor said, Mr. Walters bought millions of dollars in Dean Foods stock as its price was falling after being informed by Mr. Davis that a spinoff announcement was coming.Mr. Walters was said to have provided a cellphone, called the Bat Phone, to Mr. Davis for use while communicating insider information, and to have spoken in code, using \u201cDallas Cowboys\u201d to refer to Dean Foods and asking \u201cHow\u2019s the milkman doing?\u201d when inquiring about Dean, at the time the country\u2019s largest dairy processor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weren\u2019t Syria\u2019s Chemical Weapons Destroyed? It\u2019s Complicated", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When the Syrian government carried out a gruesome chemical attack on civilians this week, many people had a question: Didn\u2019t the Obama administration, working with Russia and international experts, destroy Syria\u2019s chemical weapons stocks in 2014?In his State of the Union address that year, President Barack Obama declared, \u201cAmerican diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria\u2019s chemical weapons are being eliminated.\u201d Months later, in July, on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry essentially declared the mission accomplished: \u201cWe struck a deal where we got 100 percent of the chemical weapons out.\u201dBut, as became obvious when a Syrian attack on Tuesday killed more than 80 people, the truth was more complicated. Here is a primer on the history of Syria\u2019s chemical stockpile, the effort to eliminate it and experts\u2019 views on the new attack.Scattered reports of chemical attacks have been made since the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011, but a large-scale attack in August 2013 \u2014 with United Nations inspectors already on the ground \u2014 got the world\u2019s attention. Mr. Obama said he intended to carry out a limited military strike to uphold the international ban on chemical weapons and deter further attacks. Then he decided to seek authorization from Congress first.But congressional support for strikes was lukewarm. Russia, seeking to head off American military retaliation, proposed an international effort to document and destroy Syria\u2019s chemical stocks. Mr. Obama, facing possible defeat in Congress, accepted.The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons sent a team to Syria. Established in 1997 and based in The Hague, the organization is charged with enforcing the Chemical Weapons Convention that bans such arms. As of last fall, it reported that 67,098 metric tons of chemical agents, or 90 percent of the world\u2019s declared stockpile of 72,304 metric tons, had been \u201cverifiably destroyed.\u201dFirst, the Syrian government issued a declaration ostensibly listing its stock of chemical weapons, though some American officials and independent experts were skeptical about whether it was complete. Teams from the O.P.C.W. visited 21 weapon-making sites to confirm that Syria had dismantled or destroyed its equipment; two other sites were considered too dangerous to visit because of fighting, but inspectors believed that they, too, had been taken apart.The weapons, and chemicals used to make them, were diluted to make the material less dangerous to transport and then loaded onto a Danish ship in the Syrian port of Latakia. That ship, under the protection of Russia and China, delivered the chemicals to an American Navy vessel, the Cape Ray, where the chemicals were neutralized. More shipments followed, and in January 2016, the O.P.C.W. announced that the last of the Syrian stocks had been destroyed.Not entirely, though by all accounts, it removed lethal weapons that could have caused slaughter and suffering on a huge scale. Even as the O.P.C.W. completed its mission, new reports emerged of scattered attacks in Syria using chlorine and other suspected chemicals.Obama administration officials say that they always believed Mr. Assad might be withholding at least small chemical supplies, and that in public statements, Mr. Kerry and others tried to refer to the elimination of Syria\u2019s \u201cdeclared\u201d stocks, a nuance often lost in news reports. American officials repeatedly returned to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons with intelligence reports on remaining chemical stocks, pressing for further action.Two possibilities are receiving attention: that the agent, sarin, was in stocks Mr. Assad hid from inspectors, or that weapons specialists in the Syrian government manufactured a new supply. While it is not simple to make sarin, it is possible in a small lab that could be easily hidden in a basement, out of sight of inspectors and foreign spy satellites.One underlying factor in Syria\u2019s latest attack may have been perceived signals of apathy from Russia and the United States. Russia proposed and participated in the destruction of weapons stocks, but since 2015, Russian officials, who have long supported Mr. Assad, have repeatedly denied or obfuscated evidence of new chemical attacks by the government.And President Trump, who publicly opposed American military action after the 2013 attack, had strongly suggested that his main concern in Syria was defeating the Islamic State, not restraining the government.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Emerging Markets Are Bouncing Back From a Six-Year Slowdown", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byAs Turkey hurtled toward one of the most politically divisive polls in its history, the country\u2019s business leaders reacted in a curious manner.They ramped up production.Ignoring terrorism threats, the yo-yoing of the Turkish currency and a president quick to pick fights with Europe, Turkish manufacturers last month reported their most buoyant month of economic activity in three years.Turkey\u2019s robust performance \u2014 exports last month were up 19 percent on an annual basis \u2014 highlights what has been a string of unusually expansive data showings by emerging markets since the beginning of the year.As the stock market in the United States takes a breather after a torrid run this year, emerging-market stocks and bonds have attracted large inflows from investors. Worries about President Trump\u2019s anti-trade statements are fading, and a weaker dollar has also helped, giving once-downtrodden currencies like the Mexican peso, the Turkish lira and the Brazilian real a lift.Stock and bond market gains in emerging markets can be fleeting, vulnerable to political turmoil and investors with short-term investment horizons. But for now, the mood is bullish.On Monday, investors bid up Turkish stocks, betting that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s referendum victory in Turkey on Sunday, giving the office of the presidency greater executive powers, would further bolster the economy. The Turkish lira, which has borne the brunt of investor fears, had one of its stronger days, gaining 2 percent against the dollar.And China said its economy, buoyed by heavy investment spending, had grown 6.9 percent, a better figure than economists had projected.Other economies considered to be emerging markets \u2014 Mexico, South Korea and Brazil \u2014 are also overcoming deterrents, like volatile currencies, political upheaval and worries of a trade crackdown by the Trump administration, to generate stronger-than-expected economic growth.This nascent boomlet follows a six-year slowdown in these once fast-growing economies.Fears that the Chinese economy would slam on the brakes, a slump in commodity prices and political scandals that hobbled countries like Brazil have taken a toll, spurring a broad exodus of global investment funds from such markets.\u201cDespite what is happening politically in mature economies, we are seeing a real broadening of growth in emerging markets,\u201d said Ulrik Bie, an economist at the Institute of International Finance, a trade group for global banks, which bumped up its growth forecasts in light of recent data. \u201cThese economies are such a large part of the global economy, so this provides a really solid foundation for overall growth.\u201dThe sources for these demand spurts have been varied.In China, import growth in volume terms, a major measure of domestic demand in the economy, was up 20 percent during the first two months of the year.Business confidence in Mexico improved sharply in March. The peso, which plunged sharply after the election of Mr. Trump, has regained all its value. For the year, the peso is up 10 percent against the dollar.And in Brazil, which is struggling to emerge from a devastating recession, the central bank slashed interest rates last week by the largest amount since 2009 in a bid to spur an economy that is revealing small, but persistent, signs of recovery.According to an index of hard and soft economic data points compiled by the Institute of International Finance, growth in emerging economies was up 6.8 percent through the first quarter this year \u2014 the model\u2019s highest reading since 2011.As an early indicator, the growth tracker\u2019s tally is by no means definitive, and it is entirely possible that the final figure for the quarter will be lower. But economists at the institute say the model is a good spotter of economic trends, and it is clearly showing a sharp pickup in global emerging markets in recent months.\u201cWe are seeing a broad uptick in business confidence and P.M.I.s in these countries,\u201d said Mr. Bie, the I.I.F. economist, referring to the purchase managers index, a gauge of private-sector manufacturing activity.The impressive trade numbers coming from China (exports grew 16 percent in March) as well as similarly robust export figures in South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia also point to a sharp recent pickup in global trade.The last few years have been poor for international commerce; fears of a China slowdown have been a major factor.But shipping executives say there has been a remarkable increase in demand for container vessels, which carry most manufactured trade goods around the globe. According to the Harpex Shipping index, which follows container pricing trends, rates have soared 40 percent this year.Economists note that container shipping is the oxygen of global growth, and for the last few years the business has been in the doldrums. Shipping prices plummeted, pushing some firms into bankruptcy and forcing many ships to be scrapped.The turnaround, coming so quickly after a bad 2016, has caught the industry by surprise.\u201cThere is definitely something going on here,\u201d said Nick Bailey, the chief commercial officer at Lomar Shipping, a container-focused shipper owned by the Libra Group. \u201cThe market from mid-last year to today has doubled.\u201dChina has been the single largest purchaser of container ships, Mr. Bailey, who is based in Singapore, said. He noted that many were being used to transport goods from hubs like Shanghai to smaller, regional ports.\u201cThis is being driven by domestic demand in China,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a big part of this growth story.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Stock Races Ahead as Investors Bet on New iPhones", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byToday, Apple\u2019s business remains sluggish, but that hasn\u2019t stopped investors, including the famously tech-averse Warren E. Buffett, from falling in love with it again. Shares of the tech giant \u2014 the most valuable company in the United States by market value \u2014 have repeatedly hit new highs this year. On Friday, they closed at $143.65, up nearly 60 percent from last May\u2019s trough.What\u2019s driving the stock, say skeptics and fans alike, is hope \u2014 hope that the new iPhones due in September, on the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone\u2019s introduction, will be dazzling enough to inspire existing iPhone users to upgrade and prompt others to switch from Android phones made by Samsung, Huawei and other manufacturers.\u201cEveryone expects Apple to cure cancer with their next product launch,\u201d said Kevin Landis, chief executive of Firsthand Funds, who has managed tech-focused mutual funds through many ups and downs.Investors will get more data about Apple\u2019s performance, and perhaps some clues about its future, on Tuesday, when the company reports its results for the financial quarter that ended in March. Analysts expect the company to report a slight increase in iPhone sales and overall revenue.Apple declined to comment ahead of its earnings report.Apple is expected to make more exciting updates in its next high-end iPhone, including a high-resolution screen that covers the phone\u2019s entire face. But the company has also suggested that much of its future growth will come from services like Apple Music, Apple Pay and the cut that Apple takes from application sales and subscriptions in the app store.\u201cWe made something bold that we thought would be great for the majority of our Mac Pro users. And what we discovered was that it was great for some and not others,\u201d Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for marketing, said at the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for that, what happened with the Mac Pro, and we\u2019re going to come out with something great to replace it.\u201dKevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management who loaded up on Apple shares near last year\u2019s lows, is one of those confident investors. \u201cApple is turning into the big Caddy that\u2019s going to cruise down the freeway, and there\u2019s a certain class of investors that are really comfortable with that. And we\u2019re that kind of investor,\u201d he said.Heavy buying of Apple shares by Mr. Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway, and by Apple itself has also helped support the stock price, accounting for one month\u2019s trading volume in the shares, according to Mr. Cybart\u2019s calculations. Berkshire is now Apple\u2019s fifth-largest shareholder, owning 2.61 percent of the company as of Feb. 27.In recent years, as United States phone carriers have stopped subsidizing the purchase of new phones, consumers have been holding on to their old smartphones longer than the typical two-year upgrade cycle. The last time that Apple made big changes to its phone lineup was in 2014, when it first introduced models with larger screens.Expectations are high that the new iPhones coming out this year will have enough improvements to prompt a big wave of new purchases. \u201cPeople are excited about a feature-rich launch,\u201d said Timothy Arcuri, a technology analyst at Cowen & Company.But as Apple pushes the innovation envelope, there are risks. The company has been having difficulty with the new type of fingerprint reader needed for its most advanced iPhone, which is expected to have a screen that runs edge to edge, with no physical home button, Mr. Arcuri said.He said Apple had just a few more weeks to work out the kinks if it hoped to meet its traditional September release date. Otherwise, it will have to delay the new phones or put the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone \u2014 a clunky solution adopted by Samsung for its Galaxy S8 phone that has been panned by reviewers.\u201cThey\u2019re wringing their hands,\u201d Mr. Arcuri said of Apple.Potential breakthroughs are also in the works.The company is developing augmented reality technology, including eyeglasses, that will overlay real objects with digital ones. Some expect a rudimentary form of augmented reality to show up in the next iPhone.Technological leaps like those would win back skeptics like Mr. Landis. \u201cHistory says that Apple does great but they never shake up the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI need them to surprise me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After rising nearly 7 percent on Tuesday, the shares, which trade on the Brazilian market and the New York Stock Exchange. were down modestly on Thursday.Another new stock, the nearly two-decade old e-commerce retailer Netshoes, got off to a rockier start.After pricing its initial public offering at $18 per share, the lower end of the $18 to $20 range it estimated in its preliminary prospectus last month, it opened on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $16.35. On Thursday, the shares were off 6 percent by midday.Still, as a rare Brazilian internet company to go public, its debut is expected to provide a psychological boost to other start-ups in Brazil.The dollar recovered from an earlier slump, while United States stock market indexes were slightly higher in morning trading on Thursday after opening lower.Wells Fargo has been trying to rebuild its reputation after revelations that employees, under pressure to meet sales targets, opened thousands of unauthorized accounts. The scandal continued to weigh on the bank\u2019s consumer businesses in the first quarter of 2017.On Thursday, Wells Fargo said revenue and profit were essentially flat in the quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. The bank was hurt by lower mortgage banking revenue, which fell 23 percent from a year ago.Shares of Wells Fargo were down more than 2 percent in trading before the market open.Trading, which bolstered JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results, also helped drive a rise in first-quarter earnings at Citigroup.Trading in bonds, currencies and other financial products was strong, with revenue rising 19 percent, to $3.6 billion, in the quarter from a year ago.Citigroup also reported a big jump in revenue and profit from Europe. The bank is something of a barometer for the state of the world economy because it gets well over half of its revenue from overseas.Sales from Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose 30 percent to $2.8 billion compared with a year earlier, while profit from the region more than doubled to $855 million.\u201cWe are off to a good start for the year,\u201d Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, said.The numbers could presage similar results from other banks with big trading operations, as last year\u2019s presidential election set off a flurry of trading and sent markets higher, though stocks have steadied a bit in recent weeks. A shift in the United States toward higher interest rates could also help bank results.About that trade gap...\u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to compete,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you have a strong dollar and other countries are devaluing their currency.\u201d\u25a0 Many markets will be closed for the Good Friday holiday.Advertisement"}

One figure listed in the filing, $100 million, is a preliminary number to be used as a basis for calculating registration fees.Also unclear is investors\u2019 interest in Dole. The company said it lost nearly $23 million last year, more than double what it lost in 2015. Excluding a host of costs like stock-based compensation and litigation charges \u2014 a calculation the company calls adjusted Ebitda, for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \u2014 the business reported $215.6 million in profit.The Dole of today is the work of Mr. Murdock, a high school dropout and, briefly, a homeless Army veteran who got his start in business by buying and selling a diner. He then turned his eye to affordable housing developments in the Southwest.But it was his purchase in 1985 of Castle & Cooke, the nearly bankrupt remainder of a Hawaiian agricultural giant, that propelled him to success. Castle & Cooke gave him access not only to land, which he developed profitably, but also to Dole, which introduced the United States to Hawaiian pineapples and ran Hawaii\u2019s biggest sugar cane fields.Mr. Murdock\u2019s eye for real estate turned Castle & Cooke into a successful developer while his management of Dole made the business one of the world\u2019s biggest sellers of fruits and vegetables. It also allowed Mr. Murdock to sell Lanai, the sixth-largest Hawaiian island, which he gained when he bought Cooke & Castle, to the Oracle mogul Lawrence J. Ellison for hundreds of millions of dollars in 2012.Although Dole separated from Castle & Cooke in 1996, Mr. Murdock bought it back in 2003 for $2.3 billion. Dole went public again in 2009, with the markets valuing it at $1.1 billion.Mr. Murdock continued to reshape Dole, selling its packaged goods and Asian produce operations to Itochu of Japan for $1.7 billion in 2012.The judge ultimately ordered Mr. Murdock and the other executive to reimburse other shareholders $148 million, one of the biggest awards in a merger-related lawsuit.Nevertheless, throughout Tuesday\u2019s filing, Dole paid tribute to its longtime owner.\u201cOur inspiration and vision comes from Mr. Murdock, who has been at the forefront of Dole and the fresh produce industry for over 30 years,\u201d the company said. \u201cCollectively, the senior management team has successfully delivered strong operating and financial results through disciplined execution and implementation of Mr. Murdock\u2019s vision.\u201dMorgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank will underwrite the offering.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "NRG, a Power Company Leaning Green, Faces Activist Challenge", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byOver the years, NRG, a leading independent power producer whose fleet once depended heavily on coal, has made big bets on low-carbon energy technologies and publicized its embrace of sustainability as essential to its future.It pursued developing renewable energy for customers large and small and set aggressive goals to reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide \u2014 50 percent by 2030, and 90 percent by 2050.But now, the company finds its strategy challenged from within.Activist hedge-fund investors, intent on extracting value from NRG assets, have installed two directors on the board who, in one potential approach, would push to sell off some of the company\u2019s renewable-power projects, raising questions about how it would meet its clean-energy goals.It is but the latest skirmish in NRG\u2019s long struggle to make several kinds of energy products \u2014 conventional and renewable, large-scale and decentralized \u2014 profitable under one corporate umbrella.\u201cIn light of Mr. Smitherman\u2019s stated views on climate change, which are incompatible with NRG\u2019s disclosed business strategy and risks, we question his ability to act in the best interests of NRG and its shareholders,\u201d Mr. Stringer wrote in the letter. \u201cAdditionally, we believe his role on the board sends a demoralizing message to the many NRG employees responsible for implementing the company\u2019s existing business strategy and managing its risks.\u201dMr. Smitherman did not return an email or phone call seeking comment about his views and how the board shake-up might affect NRG\u2019s long-term strategies and goals.The conflict has its roots in efforts led by Elliott Management, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund run by Paul E. Singer, and Bluescape Energy Partners, run by C. John Wilder, a former executive at the Texas utility TXU who has been credited with its turnaround.Under Mr. Singer, an early titan of the hedge-fund industry who has also made a name for himself as a top Republican donor, Elliott has been known for its no-holds-barred approach to taking on companies and governments over its investments around the world.As an activist investor, Elliott quietly builds up equity stakes in companies until it has a big enough position to start rattling the cages of a company\u2019s management. In South Korea, Elliott became the first investor to publicly spar with Samsung, a conglomerate run by one of the country\u2019s most powerful corporate dynasties. In Argentina, Elliott was pilloried in the local press as a \u201cvulture\u201d investor for waging a decade-long battle with the government over its defaulted debt.In its investment in NRG, Elliott has so far remained largely behind the scenes. But in an emailed statement on Thursday, Elliott said that if a buyer in the market were willing to pay a premium for some of NRG\u2019s renewables businesses, \u201cit may be a good decision for NRG and its shareholders to crystallize that value.\u201dMost of the company\u2019s power plants run on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, but it has extensive wind and solar farms, including several unfinished projects it bought last year from SunEdison, which had gone bankrupt. Earlier this year, the company reported a loss of $891 million for 2016, largely because of low natural gas prices, down from a $6.4 billion loss the year before.As for investor concerns about the appointment of Mr. Smitherman, Elliott pointed to the fact that Mr. Smitherman had extensive knowledge of the Texas regulatory landscape. NRG is one of the largest energy suppliers in Texas, and some of its assets in the state could be considered for sale, requiring extensive knowledge of the regulatory hurdles.\u201cHaving someone with Mr. Smitherman\u2019s strong Texas-centric utility regulatory background is crucial to helping NRG navigate this process,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Looney, an Elliott spokesman.\u201cAt NRG, the debate is not over clean versus conventional generation,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Looney said. \u201cThe debate is simply over who is the best long-term owner of individual assets and fleets of assets that currently reside inside the broader NRG portfolio.\u201dMr. Smitherman, an ally of Rick Perry, the energy secretary and former Texas governor, was chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission, where he helped usher in the high-voltage transmission lines that spurred the development of a robust wind industry. He then ran the state Railroad Commission, which largely regulates the oil and gas industries.NRG has reeled in recent years as it has sought to transform itself from a conventional-energy giant into a leader in the clean-energy economy.\u201cNRG is caught between what we consider the next generation of power supply and the status quo,\u201d said Travis Miller, an energy and utilities analyst at Morningstar. \u201cThe move toward renewable energy and gas generation is a trend that won\u2019t stop anytime soon so every power generator is trying to develop a strategy where they can benefit from the transition period.\u201dDavid Crane, a former chief executive, had tried to do that by transforming the company into the Google of green energy, investing in big renewable-energy projects and buying small start-ups to help capture emerging markets like rooftop solar, electric-vehicle charging and home automation. But the company pulled back from those ambitions as a combination of low oil and gas prices and the threat of rising interest rates led to turbulence in the energy markets and skittishness among renewable-energy investors and the company\u2019s stock tumbled. Despite an elaborate reorganization aimed at cutting costs, reducing debt and better aligning the businesses with investors, Mr. Crane was pushed out in 2015, and replaced by Mauricio Gutierrez, the executive vice president and chief operating officer.Mr. Gutierrez has continued to pursue the company\u2019s sustainability and carbon reduction efforts, but in a more restrained way, focusing more on large-scale renewable projects and less on the emerging markets.The company, for instance, recently re-signed the Business Backs Low Carbon pledge organized by Ceres, an advocacy group.But corporate aims may end up in the hands of directors with a different agenda.In January, Elliott and Bluescape announced that they had each bought a large stake in NRG and were teaming up to put pressure on the company to make changes to its business. NRG was \u201cdeeply undervalued\u201d and could be worth more if its management undertook \u201coperational and financial improvements\u201d as well as \u201cstrategic initiatives,\u201d Elliott said at the time in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Elliott said that Mr. Wilder and his team had \u201cdirectly relevant experience in effectuating such improvements,\u201d adding that they were in a dialogue with the board.By February, NRG announced that it had struck an agreement with Elliott, which owned 6.9 percent of the company\u2019s stock, and Bluescape, which had 2.5 percent, to replace two outgoing directors and appoint Mr. Wilder and Mr. Smitherman.NRG also agreed to undertake a business review of the different parts of the company, including examining \u201cpotential portfolio and/or asset de-consolidations.\u201dThe company\u2019s renewables business is likely to be among the assets spun off. Some analysts have argued that those businesses are undervalued because they are housed within NRG\u2019s legacy business, which involves burning natural gas, coal and oil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Have the Prosecutors Gone? Try Debevoise & Plimpton", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byOver the last year, the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton has hired the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the head of that agency\u2019s enforcement unit and a prominent federal judge.That trend will continue on Thursday, when the firm\u2019s white-collar defense group is expected to announce another acquisition from the government ranks: Winston Paes, a federal prosecutor who specializes in financial fraud.Although the job-hopping partly reflects an exodus of Obama administration officials to several prominent firms \u2014 and a homecoming for longtime Debevoise partners like Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney \u2014 the metaphorical revolving door between Debevoise and the government is spinning fast these days. Debevoise\u2019s lock-step compensation system, which pays partners in a narrow range according to seniority rather than revenue generated, is attractive to government officials who often prefer to focus on clients and cases rather than the credit that individual lawyers receive.\u201cWhen I was coming out of the government, I looked around, and I quickly decided that Debevoise had the breadth and depth of coverage in the white-collar area,\u201d Mr. Ceresney said in an interview, adding that it was important to hire people with \u201cbroad experiences in all the relevant regulatory agencies\u201d across state and federal governments.And as head of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement unit, he said, \u201cI worked closely with Winston who in my view was a tremendous asset to the Eastern District, and now it\u2019s great to have the opportunity to work with him in private practice.\u201dMr. Paes\u2019s departure from the United States attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn, known as the eastern district of New York, cleared the way for his deputy, Jacquelyn M. Kasulis, to take over the office\u2019s securities fraud section, according to an internal memo. Ms. Kasulis, who joined the office nearly a decade ago, prosecuted organized crime before joining the securities group, which handles financial fraud and Wall Street misconduct.Prosecuting those white-collar cases is something of a family business for Ms. Kasulis. Her husband, Tim Kasulis, is the co-head of the Wall Street task force at the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan.The Brooklyn and Manhattan offices have long maintained a friendly rivalry, and it has gained steam as the Brooklyn prosecutors announced some prominent white-collar cases. Mr. Paes, for example, kept a spreadsheet comparing his office\u2019s white-collar cases with those coming from his Manhattan counterpart, while the Manhattan prosecutors are known to take a broad view of their jurisdiction, jokingly referring to it as the \u201csovereign district\u201d of New York, rather than the southern district.In Brooklyn, Mr. Paes and Ms. Kasulis worked on some of their office\u2019s most prominent financial prosecutions, including the case against Martin Shkreli, the hedge fund manager and pharmaceutical executive.In a statement, Mr. Paes called Debevoise an \u201cexceptional firm with a remarkable group of lawyers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bannon Made Millions in Shaping Right-Wing Thought", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byThe personal wealth and holdings of President Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, were detailed for the first time on Friday in a filing that showed a large chunk of his income coming from right-leaning political news, film and consulting companies.The filing was included in a huge release of financial disclosures made late Friday evening by the White House, which is obligated to make public the financial assets and income of scores of officials now serving in the Trump administration.Mr. Bannon disclosed more than $500,000 in income from entities linked to the hedge fund manager Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah Mercer, including $191,000 from the right-leaning media outlet Breitbart News, $125,333 from a data firm called Cambridge Analytica and more than $60,000 from the Government Accountability Institute.The Mercers are major Republican donors who were intimately involved in the shake-up of the Trump campaign last year that led to Mr. Bannon\u2019s installment as its chief executive.However, the most valuable asset listed on Mr. Bannon\u2019s disclosure forms was Bannon Strategic Advisors Inc., a privately held consulting firm that was valued at $5 million to $25 million. In addition, Mr. Bannon held bank accounts valued at up to $2.25 million, and rental real estate worth as much as $10.5 million.The disclosure reveals more than was previously known about his ties to Cambridge Analytica, where he was vice president of the board: He had a stake in the company that he valued at $1 million to $5 million, which he plans to sell.The single most valued asset listed on Mr. Bannon\u2019s disclosure was his stake in Bannon Strategic Advisors Inc. He reported receiving nearly $500,000 in income from the company.The disclosure suggests that Bannon Strategic Advisors served as an umbrella company for receiving fees he earned from interests in other companies such as Breitbart News, Cambridge Analytica and Glittering Steel, a company that produced the documentary \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d on which Ms. Mercer served as an executive producer, as well as ads for Republican candidates.He listed his ownership interest in Glittering Steel as worth $100,001 to $250,000.Mr. Bannon intends to sell his interest in Glittering Steel and Cambridge Analytica under an agreement he has with the Office of Government Ethics. He also reports that Bannon Strategic Advisors \u201cwill be going dormant\u201d and receive only passive income from investments during his time in the White House.Mr. Bannon disclosed receiving a $100,000 salary from an entity affiliated with Citizens United Productions, a film-production company that is run by David N. Bossie, Mr. Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign manager. Mr. Bossie introduced Mr. Bannon to Mr. Trump in 2011. Mr. Bossie\u2019s Citizens United received $3.5 million from the Mercer Foundation from 2012 to 2014, according to tax returns.Mr. Bannon worked as a media banker for Goldman Sachs several decades ago and built up some of his fortune from royalties on reruns of the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d television show. Before his time at Breitbart, he helped negotiate a sale of production rights to \u201cSeinfeld\u201d that enabled him to acquire a share of the royalties.In 1998, his investment bank Bannon & Company, which helped negotiate the deal, was acquired by the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. On his disclosure form, Mr. Bannon reported an investment in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale valued at $1 million to $5 million and listed it as \u201crent or royalties.\u201dAnother Goldman alumnus who has joined the Trump administration is Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council. Mr. Cohn appears to be one of the wealthiest of Mr. Trump\u2019s White House advisers, according to his filing. His assets are valued at $252 million to $611 million, stemming chiefly from his 26-year career at the Wall Street firm.While some of funds are managed by Goldman, there is at least one notable exception: a stake valued at up to $250,000 in a venture-capital fund run by the powerhouse Silicon Valley firm Andreessen Horowitz.He also held two investments, worth at least $1 million each, in Payoff, a company based in Costa Mesa, Calif., that helps users \u201creinvent their relationship with money\u201d using a variety of refinancing and educational tools, according to language on its website. And he held stakes in some self-storage companies in Ohio, each valued at $100,000 or more.Another top Trump adviser, Kellyanne Conway, is wealthy as well, but modestly so when compared with Mr. Cohn and some of her other superrich colleagues.Ms. Conway, a Republican strategist and pollster who ran the final months of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign before joining the White House, made over $800,000 in the last year or so. As head of her own consulting firm, Ms. Conway represented clients including an assortment of conservative causes, including the National Rifle Association and Tea Party Patriots, as well as Cambridge Analytica. She was also paid for a speaking engagement at Point72 Asset Management, the investment firm run by the billionaire stock picker Steven A. Cohen.Ms. Conway\u2019s disclosures offer a glimpse into her family wealth, a sum of at least $11 million, her filing shows. Some of that wealth stems from her husband, George T. Conway III, a partner at the New York law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which has long boasted the legal world\u2019s highest profits per partner. He has been a partner for over two decades, amassing a small fortune litigating securities and mergers and acquisitions cases.Mr. Trump is reported to have selected Mr. Conway to head the Civil Division of the Justice Department.Andrew W.

Eric T. Schneiderman, New York\u2019s attorney general, garnered $2,368 from a cameo on the television police drama \u201cBlue Bloods.\u201d Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo lists $218,000 in income from a book that fewer and fewer people are buying.Yes, the annual civic ritual of filing taxes, a moment of resentment and resignation for millions of Americans, proves that while politicians are just like us, they also sort of aren\u2019t.The differences were particularly present this year in the tinge of giddiness shown by some Democratic politicians as they publicly released their returns with an added itemization: a finger in the eye of President Trump, who has refused to share his filings.But beyond the swirl of numbers, and political point-scoring, the returns released by New York Democrats also offer a look into their interests and, occasionally, their obsessions.Mr. Schneiderman enjoys jazz, and so his return includes charitable donations to the Louis Armstrong House Museum in Queens as well as Jazz at Lincoln Center. (Total giving to all charities: $11,045.)Mr. de Blasio\u2019s charitable donations include small contributions to 15 nonprofits that he has given to in past years, including social service organizations and WFUV, the Fordham University radio station. (Total donations: $2,088.)The mayor\u2019s donations are on the low end for someone with his income: While roughly a third of Americans give nothing at all, for those making more than $100,000, the average is a little over $4,000 and the median is about $1,500, said Patrick M. Rooney, a professor of economics and philanthropic studies at Indiana University.It appeared that the mayor had refinanced one or both properties, based on the magnitude of the mortgage interest declared on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s return relative to the amount of depreciation claimed, according to Jay A. Friedman, tax partner at Perelson Weiner LLP. A spokeswoman for the mayor declined to say whether Mr. de Blasio had refinanced, except to say that the rules \u201cwere obviously followed.\u201d\u201cThis payment was contractual and per the agreement with the publisher,\u201d said his spokeswoman, Dani Lever, in an email.It exceeded the $179,000 salary the governor earned last year from his day job.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Trump Bump\u2019 Lifts Stocks, Giving President a Win for His First 100 Days", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byIn his first 100 days as president, Donald J. Trump may have found much of his agenda stymied, like a health care overhaul and a hotly contested immigration order.But he can at least point to the biggest stock market rise of any president since the 1980s.In Mr. Trump\u2019s first 100 days, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen about 5 percent, in what supporters have called a \u201cTrump bump.\u201dOnly George Bush enjoyed a bigger stock market rise, with the index gaining 7.7 percent in his first 100 days as president in 1989 amid a 15-year low in unemployment and efforts to shore up the battered savings-and-loan industry.By comparison, in Barack Obama\u2019s first 100 days in the White House, the S.&P. rose 2.8 percent. Under George W. Bush, it fell 7.3 percent. Under Bill Clinton, it rose 0.9 percent. Under Ronald Reagan, it fell 1 percent.Much of the markets\u2019 movements arises from circumstances beyond any president\u2019s control. When Mr. Obama took office in early 2009, the country was still grappling with the fallout of a global financial crisis that had mired the economy in deep recession.And the younger Mr. Bush assumed the presidency amid the bursting of the dot-com bubble, which wiped out scores of internet stocks.But from the moment Mr. Trump won the 2016 election, analysts and bankers predicted a bump in the S.&P., based in part on the promises of an overtly business-friendly presidency. Mr. Trump has pledged to lift regulations that he said were stymieing private enterprise, while ushering in both big tax cuts and greater infrastructure spending.Since taking office, Mr. Trump has made good on some of those promises, lifting regulations on the financial and energy industries while appointing government officials inclined to look more favorably upon business. The White House tax proposal this week called for a drastic cut to corporate taxes.And still, much of what has happened is because of factors beyond the administration\u2019s promises and control, according to Erik Knutzen, the multi-class asset chief investment officer at Neuberger Berman.While Mr. Trump has asserted that he \u201cinherited a mess\u201d from Mr. Obama, the economy that he took over has shown some fundamental resilience: a 10th year of economic expansion, stock markets at historical highs and low interest rates.Much of the improvement in market indexes of late, Mr. Knutzen said, came from strong corporate earnings in the first fiscal quarter of the year \u2014 which the new administration would have had little to do with. \u201cI think most of the movements in the markets in the last five and a half months are much more associated with improvements in global economies,\u201d he said.On Friday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 4.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,384.20. The Dow Jones industrial average gave up 40.82 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,940.51. The Nasdaq composite lost 1.33 points, less than 0.1 percent, to 6,047.61.And the path forward for Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cut proposal is murky. What was unveiled on Wednesday so far holds great promises for corporate America, from slashing the business tax rate to 15 percent to a one-time tax holiday for companies to bring back trillions of dollars in profits earned overseas. Whether the White House can win support from Congress remains an open question.\u201cWhile that\u2019s possible, from a prudence standpoint, I think it\u2019s better to assume volatility will increase,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which former President Barack Obama began his first term.

{"Headline": "As China\u2019s Investors Rush In, Hong Kong Shares Take a Wild Ride", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Meitu had been a snoozer of a stock since listing in Hong Kong in December. Then investors from mainland China had a chance to buy in.Almost immediately, shares of Meitu, a Chinese smartphone app maker, jumped 80 percent in a week \u2014 then lost the gains nearly as fast. It briefly ranked as one of the most actively traded stocks in Hong Kong, overtaking blue-chip names like HSBC.What changed? Meitu became available to investors in mainland China in early March under a program linking stock markets there with Hong Kong.\u201cIt is obvious that the boom was driven by money from China,\u201d said one of those investors, Tan Xin, 35, a banker from Shanghai. Mr. Tan said he had invested in Meitu but cashed out early, selling before the stock peaked.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it would be such a high rise,\u201d he said.China has disrupted the prices of global assets as varied as real estate in Manhattan and copper in London. The latest example is Hong Kong\u2019s stock market, where new programs are allowing Chinese mom-and-pop retail investors to place bets outside mainland China.Some experts say those investors have played a role in some wild rides. In fact, those experts say, the presence of more mainland Chinese investors has made the Hong Kong market more volatile, adding to pressures that prompted the city\u2019s market officials in recent weeks to publicly defend its stability.Referring to some new investors from the mainland, he said, \u201cThe tourists don\u2019t know better.\u201dChina is slowly and fitfully lowering its financial barriers with the rest of the world, as Beijing tries to balance its desire for stability with its ambitions to have a much greater say in the global conversation about money. Hong Kong\u2019s experience shows that the process could involve spikes, drops and stumbles along the way, as vast sums of money \u2014 much of it controlled by people new to global finance \u2014 come to world markets.Because Hong Kong, a former British colony, operates outside China\u2019s limits on cross-border money flows and has long been a capital of global finance, the programs offered many Chinese investors their first chance to invest in global stock markets.Money can flow the other way, too. But the stock market crash in China two years ago and worries that its currency could fall in value have turned many overseas investors away from mainland stocks. Rather, the programs are drawing Chinese investors like Alex Nie, who says the mainland\u2019s stock market lacks bargains.Shanghai and Shenzhen shares \u201care overvalued,\u201d said Mr. Nie, 37, an employee in the advertising industry in Beijing who has been buying Hong Kong stocks for the last two years and who says he is a long-term investor. \u201cMany are not worth their prices,\u201d he said of mainland valuations.Many other Chinese stock investors bring a shorter-term mind-set. While private pension funds and mutual funds often steer stock markets in places like the United States, markets in China are more often swayed by amateur investors and well-heeled individuals willing to take big risks.What China has brought to the Hong Kong stock market is \u201cvery much a herd mentality,\u201d said Andrew Clarke, the head of trading in Hong Kong at the Mirabaud Group.\u201cIt\u2019s total speculation,\u201d Mr. Clarke said. \u201cPeople seize on these names, but it is not a form of investing.\u201d Instead, he added, \u201cStock Connect becomes the new Shanghai-Shenzhen casino.\u201d\u201cHong Kong Stock Connect has increased the volatility level of both Shanghai and Hong Kong markets,\u201d he said.Hong Kong has other attributes that encouraged China\u2019s hair-trigger traders. Compared with tightly controlled mainland markets, where stocks are permitted to rise or fall by a maximum of 10 percent a day, Hong Kong has fewer limits, and only on the biggest stocks, meaning hundreds more can double or fall to zero in minutes.All those factors can work against Chinese investors as well.Mainland investors were the biggest supporters of the stock the day it crashed, with buy trades from Shanghai through the Connect program accounting for more than a quarter of all turnover in the Hong Kong-listed stock before it was suspended from trading at midday. The identity of the investor or investors could not be determined.With Meitu, the Chinese app maker, the reasons for the sudden moves were less clear.The commission declined to comment. Gary Ngan, the chief financial officer of Meitu, said the company had not received notice of an investigation into the trading or been approached by regulators.Meitu, which had 520 million active monthly users as of January, allows people to create idealized versions of themselves for sharing on social media. With a swipe, users of the app can whiten their face, taper their jaw, widen their eyes or make themselves thinner. It is hugely popular in China, where the company claims half of all photos circulated on social media were created with the app.Mr. Ngan said the company had chosen to list in Hong Kong because it was the only place that provided broad access to a base of shareholders from foreign countries and, via the Stock Connect program, from mainland China.\u201cIn Hong Kong, everyone, both in China and overseas, can buy the stock and become our shareholder,\u201d he said.Still, the whipsaw trading has prompted some concern at Meitu.\u201cWe would have preferred our stock not to be that volatile,\u201d Mr. Ngan said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not something that we can control.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Check below for the latest updates.Third Point, the $16 billion activist hedge fund run by Dan Loeb, has taken aim at the technology and manufacturing company Honeywell International. In a letter just issued to investors, Third Point urges Honeywell to spin off its aerospace unit.Such a spinoff, Third Point argues, would result in a \u201csustained increase in shareholder value\u201d of more than $20 billion and would prevent Honeywell from trading at a \u201csubstantial discount\u201d to its peer group of companies, as it does now.\u25a0 Amazon reported first-quarter revenue and profit that exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates, a result of sustained growth in online retail sales and its profitable cloud business, sending the company\u2019s shares up more than 4 percent in extended trading on Thursday.The company\u2019s net income rose to $4.80 billion, or 61 cents per share, in the third quarter ended March 31, from $3.76 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.Ford\u2019s stock was down more than 1 percent in midday trading.The company\u2019s revenue grew by 4 percent to $39 billion, but it said its vehicle sales and market share dropped from the same period a year earlier. Ford executives acknowledged that the company needed to retrench as it prepared to deliver several promising new sport-utility models this year in the American and Chinese markets.As has been the case for several years, Ford\u2019s North American operations were the source of the bulk of its earnings. The company reported a pretax profit of $2 billion in the region, primarily from sales of its pickup trucks and S.U.V.s in the United States.Its international operations posted mixed results, with pretax earnings of $176 million in Europe and $124 million in Asia, and losses of $244 million in South America and $80 million in the Middle East and Africa.The bank said on Thursday that net earnings had more than doubled, to 575 million euros, or $627 million, from a year earlier. But revenue fell 9 percent to \u20ac7.3 billion.And despite frothy stock markets, Deutsche Bank\u2019s revenue from trading in equities fell 10 percent in the quarter. Revenue from sales and trading of bonds and other debt \u2014 traditionally the bank\u2019s strong suit \u2014 rose 11 percent, but analysts judged that performance inferior to those of rivals like Bank of America or Citigroup.\u201cRelative to the U.S. banks, this is a weak outcome,\u201d analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note to clients.The news sent Lloyds shares up 3 percent in early trading on Thursday.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to knowledge of Third Point\u2019s stake in Honeywell. The stake was listed in Third Point\u2019s last regulatory filing; it is not the case that the stake had not previously been disclosed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Men Bet She Would Fail; Now She Runs a $26 Billion Fund", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe floor was definitely not a place for people who were cute, prim and proper,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said in a recent interview.Those who bet against her lost.Ms. Fitzpatrick began her career at O\u2019Connor & Associates, the Chicago firm that was later acquired by UBS as the Swiss bank\u2019s internal hedge fund. She rose to lead the firm and become one of Wall Street\u2019s most powerful women. Now, largely unknown outside the industry, Ms. Fitzpatrick faces her biggest and most public challenge yet: working for George Soros, the estimable octogenarian investor and philanthropist.Last Monday, she started as chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management, which manages around $26 billion of Mr. Soros\u2019s personal and family wealth. In taking the job, she follows in the footsteps of finance legends including Keith Anderson, a co-founder of BlackRock, and Stanley Druckenmiller, the billionaire investor. Even Steven Mnuchin, the new Treasury secretary, was once brought in to open a lending business.Mr. Soros himself is perhaps the finance world\u2019s most famous investor. In 1992, he made a $1 billion bet against the British pound. The trade came to be known as one that \u201cbroke the Bank of England\u201d when Mr. Soros\u2019s heavy selling of the country\u2019s currency helped prompt the government to devalue the pound.But since Mr. Druckenmiller left the firm in 2000, Soros Fund Management has churned through eight chief investment officers. It\u2019s a remarkable turnover for the top of any company, even among hedge funds, which are known for a cutthroat culture. It\u2019s even less typical in the sleepy world of family offices, where employees manage the assets of a single clan, which is how the Soros funds are now structured after years of accepting outside investor money.And Soros is not just another family office designed to maximize wealth. There is a direct link between the money that is made at Soros and its founder\u2019s philanthropic endeavors. Mr. Soros, now 86, is an outspoken supporter of Democrats including Hillary Clinton, and travels the world seeking to promote democracy. The $1 billion that Mr. Soros made betting against the British pound, for example, helped to support scientists in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union.Though Ms. Fitzpatrick is registered as a Republican, she appears unfazed that her investing acumen will in turn support Mr. Soros\u2019s activism. \u201cIf we do a good job in terms of generating returns, the impact the money created can have is tremendous, and that\u2019s really motivating,\u201d she said.Yet Ms. Fitzpatrick, 47, takes over at Soros at a moment of global uncertainty. Impending elections in France and Germany threaten to upset the status quo across Europe. The United States is only beginning to absorb the implications of Donald J. Trump\u2019s young presidency. Markets around the world are holding steady but seem liable to drop on any given day.Ms. Fitzpatrick is bullish. She believes stocks in the United States, having hit record highs, can rise higher still. But she attributes this optimism to what she says are fundamentally healthy companies, not investor giddiness over the Trump presidency. \u201cIn reality, if we had Hillary Clinton as our president, I think we\u2019d be here or higher,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said.At the height of the financial crisis of a decade or so ago, Ms. Fitzpatrick faced the biggest decision of her career. She had risen to become chief investment officer at O\u2019Connor, then a unit of UBS, and now had to steer the firm through a period of market upheavals that would leave some of the biggest names on Wall Street bankrupt.In the summer of 2008, Ms. Fitzpatrick received a call from Richard S. Fuld, then the chief executive of Lehman Brothers. Mr. Fuld acknowledged that Lehman\u2019s stock was tumbling, but he told Ms. Fitzpatrick it would recover and asked her not to pull the billions of dollars that O\u2019Connor had with the bank\u2019s prime brokerage, a division that lends stock and cash to hedge-fund clients for trading, in exchange for housing some of the funds\u2019 capital.Ms. Fitzpatrick had a quandary. If she maintained her balance and Lehman managed to survive, she would keep a relationship with a critical Wall Street partner. But if she kept her balance and Lehman went bankrupt, she would lose billions of dollars for UBS O\u2019Connor\u2019s clients.\u201cShe did something no one else did,\u201d recalled Michael Meyer, a former UBS O\u2019Connor employee who was there at the time. \u201cShe quickly assessed the situation with him and said: \u2018Dick, your stock is trading at $22. If the stock goes to $15, I\u2019m taking half out, and if the stock reaches $10, I\u2019m taking it all out,\u2019\u201d Mr. Meyer recalled.Ultimately, of course, Lehman failed, triggering some of the worst convulsions of the financial crisis and costing many investors billions. Ms. Fitzpatrick was able to avoid the worst of it, and saved the firm from getting trapped in years of bankruptcy proceedings. Other hedge funds that didn\u2019t pull their money were stuck in losing market positions, unable to use their money to make new trades.Though the episode left her shaken, it was the kind of quick thinking she had prepared for.Born and raised in Irvington, N.Y., Ms. Fitzpatrick was the middle child among five siblings who grew up in a cul-de-sac on a street bustling with young families. She spent much of her childhood competing with taller, stronger brothers and sisters who excelled at sports like basketball. By her own description, Ms. Fitzpatrick was \u201cshort and scrawny.\u201d Her father, she said, still jokes that she is the \u201crunt of the litter.\u201dEventually she found her stride. She turned to running, something she continues to do today, usually at 5 a.m. (She still holds the record for the 3,000 meter run at her high school.)A neighbor, Marty Atlas, nurtured her early interest in the markets, showing a teenage Ms. Fitzpatrick how stock tables worked. Even as a girl, her investing prowess was evident. \u201cI remember her playing Monopoly with all these other kids, and she ended up with all the hotels,\u201d Mr. Atlas said.Ms. Fitzpatrick quickly zeroed in on her goal for after college: Wall Street. \u201cIt was the one place where you could succeed beyond your wildest dreams,\u201d she recalled. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School with a bachelor of science degree in 1992, Ms. Fitzpatrick landed a job with O\u2019Connor & Associates as part of a junior group of American Stock Exchange clerks.She moved on to trade options for O\u2019Connor at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. There, groups of traders gathered in pits to buy and sell major trading contracts, yelling out their orders while gesticulating madly. Ms. Fitzpatrick, once again an outsider on a testosterone-heavy trading floor, mastered the jargon and the hand signals.It was in Chicago that Ms. Fitzpatrick learned just how cruel markets could be. In December 1994, an economic crisis was looming in Mexico that resulted in a swift and drastic devaluation of the Mexican peso. Ms. Fitzpatrick was covering a pit where so-called locals \u2014 traders who made bets with their own money \u2014 were exposed on the wrong side when the American Depository Receipts of Mexican companies moved suddenly. They lost everything.\u201cBasically overnight, these guys who I would stand next to from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day lost their homes, lost their marriages, just everything in a flash,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said. \u201cIt really left an indelible mark on me.\u201dIn the course of her career, Ms. Fitzpatrick has tangled with regulators. While chief investment officer of O\u2019Connor, Ms. Fitzpatrick oversaw the firm\u2019s $5.3 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over charges that from 2009 to 2011 it had bought stocks in companies\u2019 public offerings while also taking the opposite position, short-selling those same stocks. The bank denied wrongdoing. More than 23 firms were slapped with similar charges.\u201cDawn would see possible risks, multiple layers, beyond anyone else in the room,\u201d said Ross Margolies, the founder of Stelliam Investment Management, which Ms. Fitzpatrick and O\u2019Connor seeded in 2007. \u201cIt was almost like she was playing a game of three-dimensional chess.\u201dAs the first female chief investment officer at Soros, Ms. Fitzpatrick becomes a woman with few peers; most everyone managing such a large pot of money on Wall Street is a man.Ms. Fitzpatrick said that, on the whole, she has not felt discriminated against because of her gender in the workplace. At UBS, Ms. Fitzpatrick kept a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes under her desk but often walked around the office barefoot, a display of her confidence.\u201cClearly, there are single moments in time when I would have rather been a 6-foot-3 blond-haired ex-football-playing guy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut those tended to be offset by the times when I thought it was an advantage to be a woman.\u201dMs. Fitzpatrick says women have innately useful qualities when it comes to money management. \u201cOne of the things I believe women have more of is humility in their investments,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll cut losers quicker, in a more effective way, than generally men will.\u201d Indeed, some studies suggest that women are more successful risk managers than men.Yet Ms. Fitzpatrick has also caught herself masking her femininity to keep up with her male colleagues. Days after giving birth to her second child, she was on a flight to London for a meeting wearing several layers of Spanx, the tightfitting undergarments meant to conceal extra pounds.\u201cFrom my perspective, perceptions matter, and it was important for me that I was there,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to think I was anything but focused.\u201dSuch hard-driving ambition can be a distraction, too. A few years later, in the summer of 2008, Ms. Fitzpatrick was so consumed by her work that she didn\u2019t realize she was pregnant for several months. The financial crisis was beginning to unfold, and the markets were swinging violently. She was often sick to her stomach, and was also getting heavier, but she figured her discomfort was a result of her stress. Plenty of her peers were having visceral reactions to the crisis.\u201cThe fall comes, and I\u2019m nauseous, and I\u2019m gaining weight, and it doesn\u2019t even cross my mind that I could be pregnant,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said.Today, Ms. Fitzpatrick maintains the long hours and relentless travel schedule common among financial executives. It keeps her away from her three children and her husband more than she would like.But she lives in Irvington, the town where she grew up, and her two sisters and her parents still live nearby. They help with the children. She admits, however, that her relentless drive is \u201cnot necessarily a virtue for everyone.\u201dIt was a prestigious job, but one that removed her from the day-to-day trading and market strategizing that associates say she loves most.Now, \u201cshe will basically be able to sit down with those managers whom they\u2019ve allocated money to, and really be able to speak the language,\u201d said Rich Cunningham, a managing director at Barclays Investment Bank.Among the new challenges she will face is all that turnover at Soros.Ted Burdick, the previous chief investment officer there, stepped down after just eight months on the job, though he remains with the firm. Others who have held Ms. Fitzpatrick\u2019s role have been caught up in the internal politics of the firm, and at times clashed with Mr. Soros himself.Ms. Fitzpatrick may be at less risk because, unlike some previous chief investment officers, she will be reporting to the family office\u2019s board of directors, rather than just Mr. Soros, who is the chairman of the board.And yet Mr. Soros, one of history\u2019s best traders, still can\u2019t help but sometimes want to manage his own money.Last year, as Britain prepared to vote on whether to exit the European Union, Mr. Soros stepped back into his day-to-day engagement, placing wagers that would be affected by the June referendum. The \u201cBrexit\u201d outcome, a surprise to many, triggered significant market swings, and Mr. Soros benefited from a position that predicted shares of Deutsche Bank would fall, among other trades.Later in the year, however, Mr. Soros lost around $1 billion wagering that Mr. Trump would lose the presidential election.Yes, investors were bullish, thanks to the belief that Mr. Trump would dismantle regulations and reduce taxes. But, he said, Mr. Trump would fail to achieve those policy goals. \u201cI don\u2019t think the markets are going to do very well,\u201d Mr. Soros said.Ms. Fitzpatrick, however, says that although she is more bullish on the stock market than her boss, they are not out of sync on the big picture. \u201cAs an investor,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to continuously evolve and learn.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cash Is King No More", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byCultural StudiesI had a strange experience the other day. I tried to pay for something with cash.It was sort of like going back to writing with a pen. My thumbs, made opposable by evolution so that humans could grab things and not just tap on a screen to acquire them, weren\u2019t working the way they were designed to.I had taken my son to our local stationery store to buy him a pack of Pok\u00e9mon cards. The pack was $5, and the store would not accept credit cards for any purchase under $10. It wasn\u2019t set up for Apple Pay either. So I took out my wallet and found that, though packed with plastic, the pouch where cash goes was empty. I plunged into my pockets and emptied them out on the counter in search of change.One penny, a type of coin that I had not thought much about for years, stuck stubbornly on the counter. I tried all sorts of moves, including quickly sliding both my thumbs toward it from opposite sides as if trying to catch it off guard, but it just slid around the surface. The cashier finally scooped it up with a business card. After I separated the coins from the lint in my pocket, I was able to put together $2.34. In the end, I had to buy two packs of cards so that I could pay with Visa.A dime was 10 cents. Two nickels were a dime. Ten dimes were a dollar. A dollar was a buck. A few bucks were dough. No one ever heard \u201cYour PayPal password or your life!\u201d The word was \u201cmoney,\u201d and money was tangible.These days, when the very idea of using a type of payment that is not also a type of investment in the form of points seems unthinkable, cash has become as rarefied as a public phone booth.Purchasing an item or service is no longer a terminus. It\u2019s the beginning, or rather, the continuation of one long transaction. Buying something used to be the goal of labor. Now it is another form of labor. Abstracted from our wallet into a zillion means by which we accrue rewards, our dollars roll up their green sleeves and go to work harvesting points as if they were grapes.This \u201cmoniverse\u201d has had a long gestation. At the dawn of what would become our modern economy, in the 17th century, the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza wrote that \u201cmoney has presented us with the abstract of everything.\u201d What he meant was that money had become the consummate medium for the human desire to possess.Now, 400 years later, everything has become the abstract of money. From the way we read to the way we eat, travel and entertain ourselves, just about every human experience has become monetized. Money itself, earning points in winding fugues of accumulation, has become monetized.Of course, along with all the many conveniences, pleasant surprises (a friend just made over $3,000 in American Express reward points) and brave new perks, the abstraction of money has its dark side. I glimpsed this as a child.My father, a jazz pianist turned real estate agent, was on a draw at his company; he was paid a salary that he would have to repay out of future commissions. This worked for a while, but when the recession hit in the mid-1970s, rising interest rates made the booming housing economy go bust. My father found himself owing his company $50,000 (about $300,000 today). In short order, he lost his job, his marriage to my mother, and his house. He had to declare bankruptcy and live off the few piano lessons he was able to put together.Aside from a love for expensive shoes and the need to lease a new Buick Electra every year, my father was not an extravagant man. The reason he kept taking the draw, even as he knew he was accumulating piles of debt, was that though the salary was real, both the source of it, and the consequences of continuing to accept it, were abstract.You used to want to make enough money to be able to have leisure time in which you could get away from money altogether. Now the very process of spending and buying is part of the experience of leisure. Why eat dinner in a restaurant in some distant corner of the world as a silver moon rises over a platinum sea if you are not paying for it with your platinum card, so that your shiny new points \u2014 filling up your future like stars clustering in the night sky \u2014 can lead you to ever more silver experiences?Perhaps we have become so used to substitutes for money, and to money as a dense forest of obscure processes like the packaging of derivatives, that there is now a high threshold for the counterfeit and the unknowable at the top levels of politics.Maybe the increasing abstraction of money holds the key to our painfully abstract presidency. A derivative is a security, like a stock, that derives its value from an underlying asset, like a mortgage. If mortgages fail, the stocks they supported come crashing down. What if the assets underlying President Trump are phantasmal, or corrupt? Only the I.R.S., tasked with keeping money real, knows for sure.Societies seem to need tangible money the way lovers must touch each other. Since money is the foundation of security, people seem to have a need to feel it with their hands.In retrospect, no one should have been surprised that Britain pulled out of the European Union. As well as being geographically \u201capart,\u201d it refused to give up its own currency. There is a palpable nostalgia for being able to make a physical connection between your country\u2019s historical figures printed on paper bank notes and your personal portion of happiness and security.An article last Sunday about the decline of cash referred incorrectly to the number of European Union members that retain national currencies. There are nine, not one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Financial Markets Can Teach Us About Managing Climate Risks", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byCost of CarbonSay an investor had only two options of what to put money in: gold or stocks. Gold has an average annual rate of return of 3 percent, while the stock market delivers a healthier 5 percent. Which should the investor choose? Seems simple, right? Take the higher payout.But annual averages can be deceiving. In fact, these two have very different risk profiles over time. Stocks tend to pay off steadily in good times when the economy is growing and we are relatively flush, but to decline in bad times. Gold might pay off next to nothing for years at a time and present real opportunity costs, but it delivers handsomely during unexpected economic crises.Investing in gold is a type of insurance policy against tough times. Financial markets are revealing that investors are willing to accept a lower average return for that insurance, precisely because it helps to manage risk.The social cost of carbon, the estimated monetary damages caused by the release of an additional ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, is the linchpin for how the federal government values climate damages. It drives the cost-benefits analyses that have determined the stringency of such things as fuel economy standards and the Clean Power Plan.Before the executive order, the social cost of carbon was set at about $40 per metric ton of carbon released. Under the executive order, President Trump appears to be putting us on a path toward valuing climate damages at much less \u2014 possibly less than $5 per metric ton of carbon.How is it that simple to reduce the estimated cost of climate damages from carbon emissions by 90 percent or more? It all depends on how we choose to value future risks.A concept known as the discount rate makes it possible to translate future damages into their present value. In 2009, President Obama convened an interagency working group, of which I was a co-leader, to come up with a uniform method for estimating the social cost of carbon: the resulting number to be used across all federal agencies. Our group chose to emphasize estimates based on a discount rate of 3 percent.The choice of a discount rate matters a great deal. Consider $100 of damages that occur 100 years from now. Because these damages are so far off in the future, it is natural to value them today at less than $100 \u2014 but how much is not immediately apparent. This is where the discount rate comes in.Although this might seem like an arcane administrative debate, the discount rate is the critical ingredient for how we value the future. And there is arguably no more consequential instance of the need to choose an appropriate discount rate than the case of climate change, because the greenhouse gases we release today will alter the climate for centuries.At its core, using a lower discount rate to calculate the social cost of carbon means paying more to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions today. But, of course, paying more today means that those resources cannot be put to use for food, shelter and other goods.Which discount rate best serves our interest in valuing climate risk? That\u2019s where the financial markets\u2019 lesson comes in.When discounting future costs, the markets tell us to choose a discount rate that matches the risk profile of the investment. So if the risk acts like a tax on the economy (e.g., it reduces G.D.P. by a fixed percentage), a higher discount rate like the stock market\u2019s average annual return of 5 percent would be justified. But if the risk is potentially disruptive, like a severe recession or worse, then markets point to a lower discount rate, perhaps like gold\u2019s annual average return or even lower.In this way, financial markets tell us that spending a little extra now as insurance to protect against potentially disruptive risk is a wise strategy. This lesson was most recently illustrated during the Great Recession. While the stock market declined by 53 percent from December 2007 to March 2009, gold\u2019s value increased by 14 percent during this period.Investors who had put some portion of their investments in gold \u2014 as an insurance policy \u2014 reaped the benefits as gold outperformed the stock market by almost 70 percent at exactly the moment that the job market was deteriorating and other investments were declining in value. In comparison, households with no such insurance policy were left completely exposed to the Great Recession.Could climate change be broadly disruptive? The science suggests that the answer is yes. There is a lot that we don\u2019t know with certainty about climate change: How much will temperature increase for a given increase in greenhouse gas concentrations? How much will sea levels rise?Although we do not have certain answers to these questions, the range of potential answers includes very disruptive possibilities. This means that climate mitigation could protect us from possibly catastrophic events \u2014 mass migration, crop failures, a jarring sea-level rise and spikes in mortality due to high temperatures.If those risks don\u2019t materialize, there will have been costs to spending today on climate mitigation. But if those risks are real, using a low discount rate to choose the degree of climate mitigation today will be like having invested in gold before the Great Recession.Michael Greenstone runs the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and is the Milton Friedman professor of economics at the university.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nasdaq Hits 6,000 as Markets Rise on Tax Overhaul Optimism", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byPropelled by the skyrocketing returns of large technology stocks, the Nasdaq composite index pushed past the 6,000 level for the first time in its history.The sharp move was driven by a confluence of positive news developments, including a market-friendly outcome in the first round of France\u2019s presidential election over the weekend and reports that President Trump will put forward a plan to slash corporate taxes to 15 percent.But it has been the technology-laden index of 100 Nasdaq stocks that has delivered the far superior performance, rising 14 percent this year \u2014 more than twice the gains of the Dow and S.&P. 500.For the day, the Nasdaq closed at 6,025.49, up 0.7 percent for the day.Driving this performance has been the persistent run-up in stocks such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon, which together now comprise about a third of the index, as measured by QQQ, the $43 billion exchange traded fund that tracks Nasdaq stocks.Apple, Amazon and Facebook are up over 20 percent for the year, with Google having increased by 12 percent.The Dow closed at 20,996.12, up 232.23 points, or 1.12 percent, while the broader S.&P. 500 ended at 2,388.61, up 14.46 points, or 0.61 percent.Analysts have pointed out, though, that compared with past manias \u2014 in particular the dot-com bubble \u2014 the recent surge in technology stocks stands on firmer ground.\u201cIn 2000, the price-to-earnings ratio for Nasdaq was 170 \u2014 today it is trading at 26 times,\u201d said Charlie Bilello, the director of research at Pension Partners, an investment advisory firm, referring to a common gauge for measuring stock valuations. \u201cThat is not cheap, but it\u2019s not crazy. We are definitely not at the level where the average guy quits his job to trade stocks.\u201dThat may be true, but there is no doubt that the explosion in size of these stocks has taken many market participants by surprise, even if it is accepted that their corporate fundamentals are superior.Indeed, the booming returns of these index-heavy stocks has been a cause of intense frustration for portfolio managers and hedge funds who charge their investors steep fees to uncover hidden gems in the stock market.That is because unless they have a large part of their portfolio in fast growing (and richly valued) stocks like Amazon, Facebook and Apple, they are going to lag their benchmarks and lose money to cheaper exchange traded funds that track these indexes and provide maximum exposure to these stocks.\u201cThe mega cap growth stocks in Nasdaq have had a strong start to 2017, and many active managers have been underweight,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, an exchange traded fund specialist at CFRA Research. \u201cPeople underestimate the fact that large companies continue to get larger.

{"Headline": "Tesla Has Something Hotter Than Cars to Sell: Its Story", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseBy \u201cthe past,\u201d he presumably means old-fashioned valuation measures like price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratios, the traditional benchmarks for evaluating stock prices. By those measures, Tesla \u2014 a company that lost $773 million last year \u2014 is indeed off the charts.Tesla\u2019s market value of nearly $49 billion is not only higher than that of Ford, which earned nearly $11 billion in profit last year, but is within easy striking distance of General Motors, which earned $9.4 billion.In contrast to Tesla, Ford and G.M. shares have dropped recently on fears that auto sales have hit a cyclical peak. Ford and G.M. executives wouldn\u2019t comment on Tesla\u2019s stock surge, but it\u2019s easy to imagine they\u2019d be tearing their hair out in frustration.\u201cIt\u2019s nuts,\u201d Bruce Greenwald, a professor at Columbia Business School and an expert in value investing, said of Tesla\u2019s stock price. \u201cInvestors believe it\u2019s going to dominate a market that no company has ever dominated before.\u201dBut Tesla is not a stock, or a company, that is measured by the past, as Mr. Musk is well aware. He also wrote on Twitter that stock prices represent \u201crisk-adjusted future cash flows\u201d \u2014 and Tesla is about nothing if not a utopian future of safe, reliable, powerful, self-driving electric vehicles powered by solar-fed batteries that are easy on the environment.In that regard, Tesla has ascended into a rarefied realm of so-called story stocks \u2014 companies that have so bewitched investors that their stock prices are impervious to any traditional valuation measures because their stories are simply too good not to be true.And to the dismay of short-sellers, who believe they have ample rational reasons to bet against such stocks, their share prices can stay in the stratosphere for years, even decades.These story stocks \u2014 the term was coined by James Montier, a value investor and a member of the asset allocation team at the investment management firm GMO \u2014 are relatively rare, but hardly new. Amazon\u2019s stock surged for decades even without any meaningful profits. A more recent example is Snapchat\u2019s parent, Snap, which is racking up large losses while its stock trades at an astronomical price-to-sales ratio of nearly 50, far higher than Tesla\u2019s 7. (Ford\u2019s, by comparison, is 0.3.)Amazon and Snap both have stories that are compelling for many investors: Amazon has transformed retailing and is destined to dominate it. Snap is reinventing communication, at least for millennials and those even younger.Early investors in Uber and Airbnb, though they remain private companies, have valued them at stratospheric multiples based largely on the notion that Uber will transform and dominate local transportation and Airbnb will revolutionize the hotel industry.For story stocks, any development that lends credence to the story can cause a surge in already high valuations. This week Tesla reported quarterly sales that were modestly above expectations, and the stock surged 7 percent in a day. Tesla shares are up nearly 40 percent this year, even though many investors considered them overvalued in January.Ron Baron, the billionaire investor and founder of Baron Capital, disclosed last year that he owned about 1.6 million Tesla shares. He predicted on CNBC in February that Tesla shares would quadruple by 2020 and triple again by 2025. By then he expects Tesla to become the largest company in the world as measured by market capitalization.For all the excitement and promise surrounding such companies, there are many cautionary tales.\u201cStories are great before bed, but are disastrous as a stock-selection technique,\u201d Mr. Montier wrote in his 2009 book \u201cValue Investing: Tools and Techniques for Intelligent Investment.\u201d If something is expensive based on traditional valuation metrics, he said, \u201cyou had better believe its story, as that is all you have.\u201d(A Tesla spokeswoman said Mr. Musk could not be reached for comment.)Various studies have shown that stocks with high price-to-sales ratios, on average, significantly underperform market averages. For every Tesla or Uber, there\u2019s a Valeant Pharmaceuticals or Theranos \u2014 two story stocks that seduced an astounding array of prominent investors and supporters based on stories that did turn out to be too good to be true.And while many investors\u2019 memories tend to be short, the so-called dot-com bubble in the late 1990s spawned scores of story stocks, nearly all of them now worthless and forgotten.Still, Mr. Montier acknowledged, \u201cStories are compelling.\u201d They appeal to intuition rather than reason. \u201cBut perhaps investors would be well advised to follow Odysseus\u2019s example of putting beeswax in his crew\u2019s ears and tying himself to the mast in order to avoid the disastrous, but oh so desirable, call of the Siren song.\u201dWill Tesla be one of the rare exceptions and, as Mr. Baron has predicted, emerge as the world\u2019s most valuable company?The company has won over many skeptics with its near-flawless execution, so far, and the high quality of its vehicles and high levels of consumer satisfaction. It is no longer a start-up: It delivered 25,000 vehicles in the last quarter. It is on track to achieve economies of scale, and the company says the gross margin on each vehicle is above 20 percent, far higher than the industry average. That could drive enormous future profits.But that\u2019s not the Tesla story \u2014 or stories \u2014 investors are betting on.Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley automotive analyst who is hardly a starry-eyed optimist about the industry, upgraded Tesla shares to overweight in January. He singles out the company\u2019s new autonomous driving technology as a compelling safety feature that will significantly reduce occupant and pedestrian injuries and fatalities. This week he said he expected \u201cvehicle safety to be the primary differentiator in Tesla\u2019s upcoming product offensive,\u201d referring to the eagerly anticipated introduction of Tesla\u2019s new, lower-price Model 3, which will be equipped with the new technology.That Tesla is an all-electric, environmentally friendly, nonfossil-fuel vehicle \u2014 the story that once excited investors \u2014 is barely mentioned anymore.Even more futuristic is the idea that Tesla cars will be entirely self-driving, able to cruise streets nearly full time (except when they are being charged at Tesla\u2019s high-speed battery-charging stations). In this vision, Tesla owners will share their vehicles with Tesla when not using them, and during that time they will ferry other passengers, serving as Tesla\u2019s version of Uber. Thus Tesla will disrupt Uber\u2019s nascent market dominance.And Tesla is no longer seen just as a vehicle manufacturer. With its solar and battery technologies, it is in a position to dominate two other enormous industry segments. Tesla \u201cis reinventing the electric grid,\u201d as Mr. Baron said on CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s a bigger opportunity than cars.\u201dEven if all that comes to pass, it may not be enough to justify Tesla\u2019s valuation unless it can sustain a competitive advantage over time, as Mr. Greenwald, the value investing expert, put it. Tesla is spending heavily on research and development, and perhaps its technology will be difficult or impossible for others to replicate. The established automakers have had years to catch up to or overtake Tesla\u2019s Model S, with a conspicuous lack of success.But for committed value investors, the writing is on the wall: \u201cIs Tesla going to dominate its industry? That\u2019s the key question,\u201d Mr. Greenwald said. \u201cWhen it comes to the global auto industry, no one ever has, and in all likelihood, no one ever will.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In America\u2019s Cup Waters, a Robot Takes On an Invasion of Lionfish", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byGlobal SportsThe America\u2019s Cup is a technology race as much as a sailboat race. Make a breakthrough in design \u2014 be it a winged keel or, in this era of hydrofoiling, a better daggerboard \u2014 and your chances of securing the oldest major trophy in sports increase considerably.But the Cup\u2019s arrival in Bermuda, the British territory in the North Atlantic where the competition will begin next month, has also been a catalyst to help solve an altogether different type of technological challenge.Bermuda has a growing problem with the lionfish, a spiny and voracious invasive species with no natural predators that is a threat to its native fish and the health of its coral reefs.The British America\u2019s Cup team, Land Rover BAR, and its sustainability sponsor, 11th Hour Racing, are intent on leaving a legacy in Bermuda and have made the lionfish a priority.Ben Ainslie, Land Rover BAR\u2019s founder and skipper, has made sustainability part of the conversation in this edition of the Cup. Last year, he was a driving force in persuading all the teams to sign a sustainability charter that committed them to eliminating single-use plastics, avoiding water pollution, reusing materials and protecting marine habitats.\u201cMy wife, Georgie, and I are good friends of Richard Branson\u2019s, and we have been to stay with him on Necker Island a few times,\u201d said Ainslie, a four-time Olympic gold medalist and the biggest star in British sailing.\u201cBeing there in the Caribbean and here in Bermuda and talking to the locals, you realize the extent of the lionfish issue, and the potential devastation it could cause,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s something they are really, really concerned about.\u201dThis week, a small group of scientists and conservationists, with the financial and promotional help of Land Rover BAR, is deploying a robot prototype in Bermuda designed to stun and capture lionfish at depths that human divers rarely reach.\u201cIt\u2019s an inventive way to try and tackle this issue,\u201d Ainslie said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to get developed over time, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll make it work.\u201dColin Angle is the chief executive and co-founder of iRobot, whose products include the robot vacuum Roomba and the bomb-disarming PackBot. Avid divers, the Angles founded Robots in Service of the Environment, known as RSE (pronounced rise), after a trip to Bermuda.The Bermuda robot is RSE\u2019s first initiative. Wendy Schmidt, a co-founder of 11th Hour Racing, has helped fund the project through Schmidt Marine Technology Partners, and Ainslie\u2019s team has helped promote it.\u201cIt certainly wouldn\u2019t have happened as quickly without the America\u2019s Cup, because we are a volunteer organization and we count on contributions from the community,\u201d Orin Hoffman, RSE\u2019s chief roboticist, said last week in Boston before heading to Bermuda.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of attention on Bermuda right now because of the Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see these beautiful boats sailing around Bermuda, and underneath them there\u2019s this pretty horrific environmental catastrophe underway with this lionfish invasion, so I think it brings the community of people who are passionate about the ocean together.\u201dThe long-term goal is to control the lionfish by making it a popular seafood choice. That will require the involvement of commercial fishermen.\u201cBelow recreational dive depths there are still enormous populations of lionfish, and some biologists believe they are doing most of their breeding at depths below the typical 90 feet that recreational divers swim at,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cSo the goal is to have our robot go down to 400 feet and be easy to use so commercial fishermen can efficiently use it.\u201cIn order to do that,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe need to make it low cost, so we\u2019re targeting $1,000 or under. That\u2019s a really hard problem.\u201dTo promote lionfish consumption, Land Rover BAR and the five other America\u2019s Cup teams will take part in a cook-off Wednesday night at the National Museum of Bermuda, where leading chefs representing each team will compete to prepare the best lionfish dish.Ainslie and the other skippers will be the judges. Participants include Chris Kenny, the head chef on Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands, and Rob Ruiz, the chef and owner of the Land and Water Company in Carlsbad, Calif., and a leading voice for responsibly sourced seafood.\u201cWe humans have created this lionfish problem for ourselves, so now our hope is that we can eat our way out of it,\u201d Ruiz said by telephone last week from San Diego. \u201cLionfish are delicious, and they are nutritious. It\u2019s a slightly sweet, white, flaky and versatile fish that can be utilized like a pollock or a snapper.\u201dRuiz sees developing a large commercial market for the species as a rare win-win (unless you\u2019re a lionfish).\u201cAll of our main fishing stocks right now are in critical condition, so this is a brilliant way to alleviate stress on all of the other species that we are targeting,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s a very beautiful creature we can capture and make a positive impact.\u201dThe lionfish is increasingly on the menu in restaurants in the United States and the Caribbean, but Ruiz said there was not yet a supply large or consistent enough to create a reliable market. The fact that lionfish spines are poisonous could dissuade some diners, but Ruiz said they were easily snipped off after capture.As a rock dweller that does not school in large numbers, the lionfish is impractical to catch by net. Spearfishing is the typical collection method, but RSE\u2019s new robot could change that.The robot is being developed by a team of volunteers, including biologists, that is working out of the Boston garage of John Rizzi, RSE\u2019s executive director.\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of moved in,\u201d Hoffman of RSE said with a laugh. \u201cWe work in folks\u2019 backyards; we\u2019ve had water tanks in, you know, questionable spots. This is a pretty classic start-up technology story. But instead of looking for an I.P.O., we are looking just to raise enough funding for us to get robots out there to make an impact.\u201dThe robot is about three and a half feet long and about 20 pounds, Hoffman said. It is equipped with a camera and controlled by a digital tablet operated at the surface. The robot is designed for now to collect up to 10 lionfish on each dive and does so by stunning the fish with a charge generated by two 14-inch, low-voltage electrical probes.\u201cBasically the strategy is to take advantage of the fact that lionfish have no known predators, so they stay relatively stationary underwater, even when the robot approaches,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cSo we stun the fish, then suck the fish up into a collection tube and repeat.\u201dSchmidt said the ability to distribute the robot and the development of a fishery in Bermuda would be important to the success of her team\u2019s efforts.\u201cI would count those as big wins if we can be a catalyst towards that kind of outcome,\u201d she said, \u201cand obviously if Ben and his team win the America\u2019s Cup, they get an even bigger platform for their messaging.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman\u2019s Dim Trading Results Raise Eyebrows on Wall St.", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byThe business of trading bonds, currencies and commodities has been booming this year, with banks like Bank of America and Citigroup reporting robust profits.Yet the bank most synonymous with that Wall Street business, Goldman Sachs, has weathered an embarrassing setback in what has usually been a core strength for the nearly century-and-a-half-old firm.All day Tuesday, analysts and investors were asking one question: What happened?A combination of low trading volume and volatility were to blame for the firm\u2019s weak trading performance in the first three months of the year, Goldman executives said on a conference call on Tuesday. Volume refers to the number of buy or sell orders clients send Goldman\u2019s way, while volatility refers to the ups and downs in a market that create opportunities to make profits on price swings. In this case, neither one was in long supply.\u201cWe did underperform,\u201d said R. Martin Chavez, Goldman\u2019s incoming chief financial officer, \u201cand the underperformance was driven by commodities and currencies.\u201d\u201cUltimately, we didn\u2019t navigate the market well,\u201d Mr. Chavez added, \u201cbut no quarter defines the franchise.\u201dIn other words, don\u2019t extrapolate too much from a single three-month period.But it was Goldman, probably the most admired trading franchise in the world, and Wall Street analysts could talk about little else.On the first earnings call he has led, Mr. Chavez endured a half-dozen questions from analysts trying to parse the trading results. One questioner, from UBS, even apologized for the repetition. \u201cSorry to give you a hard time here on your first call,\u201d he said.Mr. Chavez declined to elaborate on what he had already said. A call with reporters afterward followed a similar arc.Investors, surprised and disappointed by the results, punished Goldman shares on Tuesday. The stock closed down 4.7 percent, leading the Dow Jones industrial average lower. It was the sharpest daily decline in Goldman shares since the day after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union last June, according to data from Bloomberg.\u201cThere\u2019s no shying away; it\u2019s a bad quarter,\u201d Glenn Schorr, a senior financial analyst at Evercore ISI, said in an interview that afternoon.It was bad enough that Goldman\u2019s net revenue from bond trading, which was $1.7 billion, was up just 1 percent from the same period of time last year, he said. But the fact that Goldman rivals like JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Bank of America were up an average of about 21 percent made the situation much, much worse.\u201cThat difference of 20 percent is what all the hoopla is about,\u201d Mr. Schorr said.Goldman did not explain exactly how much money it had lost, if any, on the weakness in currency and commodity trading, saying only that it had notched \u201csignificantly lower\u201d net revenue in those areas.Analysts, however, said that language of that sort often indicates losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars.The broader picture at Goldman also disappointed investors. The firm reported net earnings of $2.26 billion in the first quarter, nearly double the figure from the quarter a year earlier. But at $5.15, the figure for earnings per share was significantly less than the Wall Street consensus estimate of earnings of $5.31 a share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.Still, there were encouraging signs. At just over $8 billion, Goldman\u2019s overall net revenue, for instance, was actually higher than analysts\u2019 expectations. The firm remains No. 1 among banks in advising companies on mergers and acquisitions, as well as underwriting corporate stock offerings. And Goldman\u2019s net revenue from investing and lending, where it provides capital to outside companies, was at its highest quarterly level in four years.The earnings disappointment comes amid some management changes at the firm even as its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, rounds out his 11th year at the top.In the eyes of some veterans of the firm, it was a much-needed change. Even Mr. Cohn had advocated in recent years the promotion of a new generation of executives. New ideas were needed to address questions of scale and scope at the firm, despite its dominance in many areas.The quarterly results suggest Mr. Cohn may have had a point.In addition to Goldman executives\u2019 singling out the low volume and volatility in certain trading areas, \u201cthey did make a cryptic comment on the call about how the markets could have been managed better,\u201d noted Guy Moszkowski, director of United States research for Autonomous Research.But Goldman executives suggested that no specific position in the markets had harmed results, and analysts and employees said the problems were more likely caused by the firm\u2019s unique position in the markets than by any one trading misfire.Goldman\u2019s client base, Mr. Moszkowski noted, comprises more \u201cprofessional investors,\u201d like hedge funds, than the customers of rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which cater to a broader array of corporate clients.And corporations can help create bigger trading volumes in areas like foreign-currency trading, even when volatility is low, helping to shore up revenue during challenging periods.And then there\u2019s the fact that Goldman is a bellwether financial stock at a time when the postelection ebullience has cooled a bit.\u201cPeople got very enthusiastic about the potential for the administration to do a lot of things, and now it\u2019s turning out that doing a lot of things is going to be harder and take longer than the market thought,\u201d Mr. Moszkowski said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a microcosm of that.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about Goldman Sachs\u2019s earnings misstated, in some copies, the position that R. Martin Chavez, Goldman\u2019s incoming chief financial officer, previously held with the company. He was chief information officer, not chief technology officer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apologies. Really. And I Will Definitely Grow Up.", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byEssayEverybody loves getting an apology. Nobody enjoys making one, especially in public life, where leaders tend to see admitting an error as a sign of weakness.That\u2019s why I\u2019m amazed by what has happened in the last couple of months: A captain of industry apologized for something. No, wait \u2014 two of them did! And then an epidemic of apologies started spreading.Let\u2019s slow down a moment. That was dollars: four billion of them.As he told shareholders last month, \u201cWe remain short Herbalife because we believe its intrinsic value is meaningfully below the current share price, and we believe the stock should eventually decline to zero.\u201dThat used to seem like a lot of money, but the Valeant debacle makes the problems with Herbalife look sort of puny.Today, Mr. Ackman is a true Wall Street titan, one whose investment went down like the Titanic. It makes you wonder: What does it take to lose $4 billion on a single company, anyway?I\u2019ve lost money in my time (lost a fair bit of change through a hole in my pocket, got out of a co-op apartment at a loss), but this is in such a different league that he\u2019s making me feel good about myself. You could call it shekelfreude, if you will.\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cwe cannot guarantee that every one of our investments will be successful. We regret the loss which occurred due to Valeant board and management decisions made prior to our active engagement with the company.\u201dEven so, he seemed to turn his mea culpa into a they-a culpa, writing, \u201cIn retrospect, we misjudged the prior management team, and this contributed to our loss.\u201dWas that enough? I called Lanny J. Davis, a former White House special counsel during the Clinton administration who has founded a law firm, Davis Goldberg & Galper, that specializes in crisis response.He said he has no inside knowledge of Mr. Ackman\u2019s business or of what led to Mr. Ackman bringing out the scourge, but said: \u201cThe apology is too little too late. If you\u2019re doing crisis management, it\u2019s not enough to say \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 \u2014 though that is a good first step.\u201d Instead, he said, the apology has to move things forward. \u201cHere are the facts, here is why I\u2019m apologizing, and here is what I learned so it won\u2019t happen again.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf you attack one week and apologize the next week, you\u2019ve got to fill in the gap and be more transparent.\u201dMs. McCarthy read through Mr. Ackman\u2019s apology. She, too, found it at war with itself: the boasting about past success and then the mea culpa for the losses.\u201cA sort of bragpology,\u201d she said. She cited the line stating: \u201cMy approach to mistakes is that I personally assume 100 percent of the responsibility on behalf of the firm while sharing the credit for our success.\u201d Ms. McCarthy said, \u201cThe wriggling around on I/we, and the repeated blaming of the prior management team make it look like he\u2019s having a hard time taking that 100 percent responsibility.\u201dThose of us who are not great must also know how to apologize. I intend to do so frequently. And I\u2019ll start with you, dear reader:Please let me apologize for this article, if it did not make you laugh out loud at least once. Of course, if it did not, this is undoubtedly your fault as a reader without a sense of humor.However, it does not absolve me of my responsibility. The yuck stops here. Just as long as there aren\u2019t any real consequences.I hope to do better in the future. I have a plan in place to be 10 percent funnier in every column on the world of investing, quarter over quarter. How? By being funnier. If you are smart, you will see.And I will grow up. I\u2019m not saying when.Advertisement"}
